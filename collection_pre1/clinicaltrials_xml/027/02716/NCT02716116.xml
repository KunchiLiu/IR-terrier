	<detailed_description>This phase 1/2 study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , anti-tumor activity oral EGFR/HER2 Inhibitor AP32788 patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The trial conduct two part : dose escalation phase , follow expansion phase . The objective dose escalation phase determine safety profile orally administer AP32788 , include maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) , recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) pharmacokinetic profile . The primary goal expansion component trial evaluate anti-tumor activity AP32788 four histologically molecularly define cohort RP2D ( determine base dose escalation phase trial ) . The four expansion cohort : 1 . NSCLC patient EGFR exon 20 activate insertion active , measurable central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ; 2 . NSCLC patient HER2 exon 20 activate insertion point mutation active , measurable CNS metastasis ; 3 . NSCLC patient EGFR exon 20 activate insertion HER2 exon 20 activate insertion point mutation active , measurable CNS metastasis ; 4 . NSCLC patient target AP32788 active ( example include EGFR exon 19 deletion exon 21 substitution [ without T790M mutation ] uncommon EGFR activate mutation ) , without active , measurable CNS metastasis .</detailed_description>
