	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , disable neurologic disease characterize damage myelin axon central nervous system ( CNS ) . Current therapy MS primarily consist immunomodulatory drug aim prevent future CNS injury ; treatment currently available repair exist damage , symptomatic treatment improve neurological function quite limited . Rehabilitation approach , exercise , long staple MS therapy . Exercise therapy MS patient proven benefit mobility , mood , motor function quality life . While beneficial effect exercise cardiovascular musculoskeletal function well know , recently increase focus positive effect exercise brain structure function . The overall aim proposal determine whether exercise promote beneficial change brain function MS patient . The investigator 's central hypothesis cardiovascular exercise alters brain structure brain function MS patient , change identify monitor via image technique evaluate regional brain volume functional connectivity . When brain activity measure one area fluctuate coherent manner record different area , brain region consider functionally connect . Using resting-state magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , investigator 's laboratory demonstrate pattern correlate brain activity abnormal MS patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient confirm diagnosis MS revise McDonald criterion Age â‰¥ 18 year Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) 06.0 , inclusive . Able understand consent process , use wristband activity tracker . Sedentary selfreport ( answer question : `` Do exercise regularly ? '' Willing make sincere effort comply study objective increase physical activity much possible ( goal least 100 % increase ) maintain increased activity level six month ( randomized exercise group ) . Current serious medical condition would likely limit subject 's ability achieve sustain increase physical activity , put risk investigator ' opinion ( e.g . significant cardiovascular respiratory disease , cancer , cancer , orthopedic disease , etc ) Subjects central nervous system disorder ( addition MS ) consider secondary MS Subjects implant metal , pacemaker , etc . may interfere MEG/MRI scan otherwise unable complete MEG/MRI scan procedure without sedation ( e.g . due claustrophobia , obesity ) weight &gt; 300 pound</criteria>
