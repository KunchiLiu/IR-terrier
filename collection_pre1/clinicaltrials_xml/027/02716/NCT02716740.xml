	<brief_summary>Despite demonstrable health quality life benefit , unknown within consequence obesity surgery . Weight loss composition poorly understood . The objective significant loss body fat limited loss muscular weight . A cohort study nutrition unit Toulouse University Hospital show 3 month 1 year surgery , 2 phenotype patient . The first one call 'little loss ' define contribution muscular weight low 15 % total weight loss . The one call 'big loss ' define contribution muscular weight high 15 % total weight loss . Causes different phenotype unknown moment . Some amino acid anabolic potential . Leucine induces muscular protein synthesis clinical situation like hepatic cirrhosis , population like new bear old people . Assuming , leucine-enriched essential amino acid supplementation benefit effect muscular mass . That test influence quality protein consume , quantity . An anabolic substance ( amino acid ) lead gain muscle associate regular physical training , patient follow physical training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Amino Acid Supplementation Patients With Excessive Loss Muscular Body Mass After Obesity Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An excessive loss lean mass could negative metabolic consequence . Indeed , lean mass essential determinant weight loss glycaemia regulation . An important loss muscular mass could expose person reduction quality life ( fatigue ) , even functional loss . Muscles important insulin sensibility glucose metabolism . Muscles proteolysis target protein use source amino acid cellular function . Changes lean mass centre several study , change muscular mass bariatric surgery report one time . A cohort study nutrition unit Toulouse University Hospital show 3 month 1 year surgery , 2 phenotype patient . The first one call 'little loss ' define contribution muscular weight low 15 % total weight loss . The one call 'big loss ' define contribution muscular weight high 15 % total weight loss . Causes different phenotype unknown moment . Nothing distinguishes surgery . Type surgery , gender , protein intake ( grams protein intake per day ) appear determine influence intensity muscle mass loss . The study publish show change muscular mass 15 % 6 week . Relation glycaemia change muscle mass change suggest patient modest change muscular mass patient best improvement glycaemia surgery . It reason , could interest preserve muscular mass . Nowadays , consensual strategy compensate loss muscle mass . It important time anabolic stimulus ( training , hormoneâ€¦ ) sufficient energy protein intake . According recent study compare leucine intake placebo weight loss drive low-calorie diet associate muscle strengthen exercise , patient loss weight , leucin group gain lean mass , placebo group lose . Accordingly , twe different dos amino acid test use diet supplement . This study test influence quality protein consume , quantity . Patients take leucine-enriched amino acid supplement follow physical training . Aromatic amino acid supplementation show anabolic effect old people , undernourished child undernourished patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . There known side effect . This amino acid supplementation evaluate post-obesity surgery context .</detailed_description>
