	<brief_title>Effect B-GOS Wellbeing Ageing Healthy 52-65 Years Old Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With age , several important alteration occur within gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , responsible alter microbial environment ( e.g . reduce diversity number beneficial bifidobacteria high population enterobacteria clostridia ) . Research past two decade provide evidence administration probiotic ( live microorganism , administer adequate amount , confer health benefit host ) could use optimise gut microbiota prevent treat range disease , well enhance immune function . Somewhat le documented recent concept use prebiotics ( nondigestible food ingredient beneficially affect host selectively stimulating growth and/or activity one , limit number bacteria colon ) . Prebiotics naturally available breast milk certain vegetable also synthetic oligosaccharide best know researched example include fructooligosaccharides ( FOS ) galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) . B-GOS low molecular weight GOS mixture , show increase number probiotic bacteria , especially bifidobacteria , young old adult , irritable-bowel sufferer overweight adult . B-GOS also significantly decrease colonisation pathology salmonellosis incidence duration traveller 's diarrhoea . Our aim investigate potential B-GOS beneficially influence wellbeing age healthy adult ( 52-65 year old ) . The assessment would consist various questionnaire cover quality life , bowel function , mood sleep blood marker inflammation age .</detailed_description>
