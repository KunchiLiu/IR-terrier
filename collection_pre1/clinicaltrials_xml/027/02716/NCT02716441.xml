	<brief_summary>This proposal 's objective challenge expand current definition rotator cuff heal investigate tendon retraction - broadly define medial translation repair tendon away bone without defect - common clinically predictive structural outcome follow rotator cuff repair . The investigator ' central hypothesis failure continuity common yet unrecognized structural phenomenon rotator cuff heal significantly meaningfully correlated clinical outcome . The investigator ' approach characterize tendon retraction use array implant radio-opaque marker , investigate relationship pre-operative tissue quality ( MRI ) , post-operative repair structural integrity ( MRI ) clinical outcome 125-patient prospective cohort study . These patient complete validated questionnaire pre- 6 week post-operatively , repeat questionnaire well undergo MRI ( repair integrity ) , CT imaging ( tendon retraction radio-opaque marker ) strength test 3 , 6 , 12 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotator Cuff Failure With Continuity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , rotator cuff healing define `` intact '' , `` attenuate '' , `` fail '' base observation ( ) recurrent defect ( i.e. , `` gap '' ) tendon use MRI ultrasound image . The investigator ' previous work identify new outcome , detectable defect `` gap '' repair tendon , repair tendon undergone significant retraction . The investigator call outcome `` failure continuity '' . Current image method inadequate determine extent repair rotator cuff tendon `` failed continuity '' . The investigator develop image technique detect phenomenon . Specifically , radio-opaque marker suture onto repair tendon impact nearby arm bone . The distance tendon bone marker measure CT scan take within 2 week surgery , compare distance marker 3 , 6 , 12 24 month . If tendon retract away bone healing , distance tendon bone marker increase time . Healing tendon also monitor traditional manner MRI scan time point . The investigator investigate relationship tendon retraction , MR image clinical outcome include shoulder strength patient satisfaction . The investigator expect show tendon retraction common , occur early post-operatively , without repair continuity assess traditional imaging , significantly correlate clinical outcome . The immediate highly significant consequence find would paradigm shift investigator ' understanding tendon repair healing , incorporate magnitude , time location tendon retraction well continuity repair tissue . This information would yield precise understanding rotator cuff tendon healing , allow advance treatment strategy improve surgical healing clinical outcome result durable rotator cuff repair time .</detailed_description>
