	<detailed_description>In study , investigator seek evaluate bone marrow blood sample treatment response see Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) ( describe ) , use predictive method response treatment amyloidosis . Minimal residual disease ( MRD ) concept gain significant value prognostic predictor become emerge constituent complete response ( CR ) reassessment multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient . Studies MM demonstrate 30 % patient achieve CR high-dose therapy still detectable MRD bone marrow measure standard-sensitivity flow cytometry molecular assay . Virtually every study examine MRD MM report among patient achieve CR , MRD negative ( MRD- ) significantly superior progression-free survival , study report superior overall survival . As amyloidosis disease similar multiple myeloma , investigator wish evaluate concept disease .</detailed_description>
