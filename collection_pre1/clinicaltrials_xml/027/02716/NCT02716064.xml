	<detailed_description>This pilot study program evaluation employ developmental evaluation technique collect qualitative quantitative data handle , use sequential explanatory mixed method approach.Developmental evaluation particularly useful pre-formative development potential scalable intervention . Developmental evaluation track attempt make sense emerge condition complexity , document interpret dynamic , interaction , interdependency occur innovation unfold . It helpful explicitly understand : 1 ) important decision occur TAPESTRY-CM intervention development process ; 2 ) data validate decision intervention structure deliver . This understanding provide basis describe key decision rationale community community make informed adaptation local context . TAPESTRY-CM apply principle participatory design engage community stakeholder co-create refine TAPESTRY-CM intervention early phase project . The use mixed method purposefully choose developmental evaluation . Answering set relate research question include collecting , analyze interpret qualitative quantitative data increase depth understanding result , provide strong evidence pattern theme data converge , neutralize cancel disadvantage method alone , explicitly recognize social phenomenon complex vary method helpful best understand complexity .</detailed_description>
