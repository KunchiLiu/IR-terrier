	<brief_title>Early Surgery Versus Conservative Treatment Patients With Ileocaecal Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical therapy currently indicate Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patient conservative treatment become ineffective . The principle so-called step-up therapy ( STUP ) surgery represent last therapeutical option still follow . Early surgical intervention ( Early Surgery - ES ) alternative even patient uncomplicated type CD medical therapy use ( Top-down approach ) . Limited resection condition lead immediate remission . Moreover , laparoscopic ileocaecal resection safe low morbidity regard potential complication step-up treatment might beneficial patient . Before wide introduction ES approach clinical practice , necessary perform randomize trial compare early resection standard step-up medical therapy . The potential effect early , intensive therapy ( ileocaecal resection ) biological behavior disease study patient uncomplicated ileocaecal form suitable trial . Significant number patient indeed progress unfavorable course disease ( relapse , complicate form , early recurrence ) . Other potential benefit early resection extend period without necessary medication . Even pharmacological recurrence prevention need surgery uncomplicated CD patient risk factor exclude . Rapid remission induce surgery lead faster improvement quality life long-term medication .</detailed_description>
