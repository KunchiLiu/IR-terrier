	<brief_summary>Current guideline recommend use rotational atherectomy ( RA ) preparation heavily calcify severely fibrotic lesion cross balloon adequately dilate planned stenting ( bailout situation ) . RA emerge 1990s one several tool treat luminal obstruction via physical removal plaque . Although initially explore alternative balloon angioplasty , RA show favorable acute result facilitate stent delivery adequate expansion , particularly affected heavy calcification.Drug-eluting stent ( DES ) substantially reduce re-stenosis rate randomize clinical trial evaluate simple de novo coronary artery lesion also show favorable result implant complex lesion patient , high event rate observe treat subset compare simple lesion even new generation DES . However , limited data evaluate safety effectiveness RA follow DES implantation heavily calcify lesion contemporary practice . Recent randomize control trial show RA paclitaxel elute stent implantation first generation DES superior paclitaxel elute stent implantation without prior RA reduce primary endpoint in-stent late luminal loss 9 month , indicate RA increase efficacy DES patient moderate severe calcify lesion . However , 15 ( 12.5 % ) crossover standard therapy rotablation failure balloon stent delivery suboptimal balloon expansion despite use noncompliant balloon . Accordingly , procedural fluoroscopy time longer elective RA procedural complication occur equally elective RA bailout RA . These finding might cause substantial portion enrol population moderate calcify lesion , severe calcify lesion . In particular , everolimus-eluting stent ( EES ) new generation DES could act synergistically heavily calcified lesion RA could avert stent coat damage EES could effectively suppress neointimal proliferation . Therefore , compare in-hospital long-term efficacy safety elective RA versus bailout RA low-volume operator versus high-volume operator patient severe calcified lesion treat EES .</brief_summary>
