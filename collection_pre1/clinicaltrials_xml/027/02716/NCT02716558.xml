	<detailed_description>Dental caries diet dependent , transmissible , micro biologically mediated disease , follow infectious chronic disease model progress slowly period quiescence . From literature available , understood although dental caries decline many developed country , still remain unchanged regard pit fissure caries occlusal surface teeth . This increase susceptibility due inherent morphological structure make person unable maintain cleanliness devoid food lodgement.. Although pit fissure occlusal surface form 12.5 % tooth surface yet , constitute 2/3rd total caries experience among young permanent teeth . The prevention dental caries include measure prevent occurrence disease , risk factor reduction , also arrest progress disease reduce consequence disease establish Creativity effort fissure caries continue , new material technology test year . The traditional preventive method , diet control fluoride therapy effectively prevent dental caries smooth tooth surface , satisfactory method control caries pit fissure . At time acid etch bond first describe Buonocore 1955 , bond new technology , logical step use prevention pit fissure decay . The focus Buonocore 's work development sealant prevent occlusal caries posterior teeth.Thus , resin sealant bear . Acid treatment enamel dentin , whether priory concomitant bond step , integrate method retain material significantly reduce micro leakage material tooth interface . Pit fissure sealant `` cement resin material introduce unprepared occlusal pit fissure caries susceptible teeth , form mechanical physical protective layer action acid produce bacteria substrate '' . Pit fissure sealant introduce Cueto Buonocore 1967 accept efficient caries preventive method . For period since introduction sealant , focus Bis-GMA resin base material . Resin base sealant test many occasion generally show effective method caries prevention child young adult , . The efficacy resin sealant prevent caries associate duration degree sealant retention . However , application resin base sealant demand total moisture control hydrophobic nature often possible limited extent particularly child low compliance . Ideally , material combine attribute resin base sealant , good retention good physical property moisture tolerance would desirable . Recently , unique moisture tolerant resin base sealant call embrace wet bond sealant introduce . Embrace incorporate di-tri multi-functional acrylate monomer advance acid integrate chemistry activate moisture . The advantage wet bonding , tooth integrating , good retention , superior marginal seal , less technique sensitive increase fluoride release . Another class sealant develop glass inomer base sealant primarily indicate subject , total moisture control achievable . These sealant , although hydrophilic major drawback low retentivity . In order overcome drawback , high viscosity glass inomer cement use ART approach introduce sealant material . A notable point give consideration fact although embrace wet bond sealant ( resin base sealant ) ART sealant ( GIC base sealant ) belong different class sealant , indicate condition total moisture control impossible achieve . There absolute lack information regard relative performance moisture tolerant resin base sealant ( embrace wet bond sealant ) ART sealants therefore clinical trial evaluate retention caries preventive aspect say material among representative sample 7- 10 year old caries prone child .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects fully erupt contralateral permanent mandibular first molars well defined deep irregular pit fissure . The entire tooth surface visible mouth free mucosal tissue . An open carious lesion exists . A large occlusal restoration already present . Presence caries surface tooth . Subjects developmental anomaly hypoplastic permanent first molar . Subjects suffer systemic disease long term medication .</criteria>
