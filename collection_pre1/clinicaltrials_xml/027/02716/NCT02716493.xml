	<brief_summary>Exercise-based rehabilitation improve physical function , fatigue quality life patient thoracic neoplasia . Consequently , need rehabilitation across continuum care oncology grow rapidly . However , implementation type intervention limit many barrier patient ' symptom poor accessibility program . In context , healthcare system develop implement new approach dispense service . Consequently , telerehabilitation promising strategy improve access adherence rehabilitation . OBJECTIVES To investigate feasibility , adherence satisfaction home-based telerehabilitation program ( TELERP ) real-time physiological parameter acquisition patient unresectable thoracic neoplasia receive chemotherapy explore effect patient ' functional capacity . METHODS Five patient receive chemotherapy follow 8-week TELERP use real-time monitoring combine interactive exercise . The TELERP include supervise ( 15 ) unsupervised ( 9 ) strengthen cardiovascular exercise session rate 3 sessions/week . The feasibility TELERP , adverse outcome , technical issue , program adherence satisfaction analyse . Prior program , six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , time go ( TUG ) time stair test ( TST ) do assess functional capacity</brief_summary>
