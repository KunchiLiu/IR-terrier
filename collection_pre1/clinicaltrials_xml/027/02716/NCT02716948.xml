	<brief_summary>This phase I pilot trial study side effect stereotactic radiosurgery nivolumab treat patient newly diagnose melanoma spread brain spine . Stereotactic radiosurgery specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor precisely target cancer . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together nivolumab may better treatment melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety profile stereotactic radiosurgery nivolumab combination treat patient newly diagnose melanoma brain spinal metastasis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate local control rate brain spine . II . To estimate systematic control rate . III . To estimate progression-free survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore peripheral blood immune response treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery day 8 per standard care . Courses nivolumab repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 10 week , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
