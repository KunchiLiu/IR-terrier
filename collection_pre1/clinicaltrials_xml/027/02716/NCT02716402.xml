	<detailed_description>Patients cyanotic congenital heart disease reduce oxygen content blood due abnormal connection heart 's right leave side . The reduced oxygenation blood affect several organ body common complication disease blood clot . Despite patient young typical risk factor , previous study show , high prevalence thrombosis lung brain . The reason increase prevalence blood clot know . A previous study investigate prevalence blood clot systematically patient cyanotic congenital heart disease find approximately 30-40 % patient clot lung brain . Thus , study could predict , patient thrombotic event , patient previously image perform . Therefore aim study re-examine previously examine cyanotic patient regardless previous medical history , assess many patient obtain additional blood clot since examine 8 year ago .</detailed_description>
