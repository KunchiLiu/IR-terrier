	<detailed_description>Bulimia nervosa ( BN ) eat disorder characterize pattern binge eat compensatory behavior well overemphasis body weight shape self-evaluation . BN lifetime prevalence rate 1-3 % associate numerous psychiatric medical complication . Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) regard gold-standard treatment BN treatment approach empirical support date . However , although CBT accumulate impressive empirical support effectiveness , CBT produce abstinence binge eat purge 30-50 % treatment completers . Furthermore , relapse common many individual maintain treatment gain . Innovative treatment improve rate remission among patient BN relate disorder sorely need bulimia nervosa related eating disorder , particularly individual exist treatment fail . Weight suppression ( WS ) robust predictor bulimic symptomatology , positively correlated frequency objective binge eat purge individual BN . A recent study find woman experience objective binge episode twice weight suppress ( M = 8.8kg ) without eat problem ( M = 4.4kg ) . Among patient threshold sub-threshold BN , great WS baseline predict increase likelihood persistent BN symptom 10-year follow-up . Furthermore , comparison group without bulimic symptomatology baseline , high WS predict onset bulimic syndrome 10-year follow-up . WS appear uniquely predictive binge eat purge behavior rather disorder eating behavior broadly ( e.g . shape weight concern , drive thinness , BMI ) , suggest WS merely marker disease severity . This body research suggest WS may important factor maintenance BN pathology , may significant contributor etiology . Additionally , WS predict remission treatment outcome BN . Butryn , Lowe , Agras ( 2006 ) previously find great WS predict poor outcome cognitive-behavioral treatment BN , perhaps high WS great difficulty normalize eat without gain weight . Although two recent study fail replicate finding , replication study include patient whose average WS level substantially low mean level study Butryn colleague ( Carter , McIntosh , Joyce &amp; Bulik , 2008 ; Zunker , Crosby , Mitchell , Wonderlich , Peterson &amp; Crow , 2011 ) . This might suggest relatively high level WS relevant treatment outcome . In recent study , level WS study entry predict time first full partial remission disorder 8 year follow-up ( Lowe , Swanson , Clark , Eddy , Franko , Shaw , Ross &amp; Herzog 2011 ) . Novel treatment need address barrier successful treatment BN within patient high WS . The high metabolic efficiency elevate WS could help explain WS consistently predict weight gain several BN sample , period short several week long five year . If great WS patient trigger great weight gain , may intensify diet effort compensatory behavior slow prevent weight gain , thus perpetuate BN symptom . Patients appear `` biobehavioral '' bind , whereby need continue utilize disorder eat symptom prevent weight re-gain , may explain individual high WS poorer treatment outcome require significantly long time achieve partial full remission . Even modest weight gain , may help patient high WS experience few urge binge effectively normalize eat behavior , highly distress patient BN . Treatments specifically address add barrier face patient high WS may need improve treatment efficacy sub-group . In particular , approach alter biobehavioral bind 1 . ) increase willingness increase caloric intake experience modest weight re-gain treatment despite distress 2 . ) promote adaptive healthy behavior design stabilize weight gain could improve treatment efficacy . Existing CBT may enhance incorporate acceptance-based behavioral strategy nutritional counseling help patient high WS reduce biobehavioral bind WS eliminate BN symptom . Acceptance-based behavioral treatment ( ABBTs ) emphasize `` change accept ca n't '' , refers focus learn accept tolerate distress internal experience ( e.g. , thought , emotion , urge , physical sensation ) might directly patient ' control choose engage adaptive behavioral choice within control . Patients high WS likely need gain weight experience improvement associate reduced biobehavioral bind ( e.g. , reduce urges binge , great ability normalize eat behavior ) , need `` accept '' distress accompanies weight gain . However patient may also benefit provision adaptive behavioral strategy maintain weight healthy range , primary goal exist behavioral treatment . Nutritional counseling ( NC ) , design promote healthy , non-rigid dietary restraint exercise habit , lead improvement weight control may also improve disorder eating behavior . As described , primary maintenance factor BN strict rigid diet behavior trigger urges binge . For patient high WS , degree dietary restraint may need stabilize weight gain provision healthier functionally adaptive strategy regulate weight could reduce likelihood engage disorder eat symptom . Several study indicate provision healthy restraint strategy patient BN reduce binge eat purge behavior , suggest approach effective treatment alone combination behavioral technique . Of relevance current study , two recent clinical trial examine Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , widely study ABBT , eat pathology ( Juarascio , Forman , &amp; Herbert , 2010 ; Juarascio , Shaw , Forman , Timko , Herbert , Butryn , Bunnell , Matteucci &amp; Lowe , 2013 ) . The first study examine treatment sub-clinical eating pathology within context large randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare standard CBT ACT find ACT condition experience significantly great reduction eat pathology ( measure Eating Pathology Index , adapt SCOFF Assessment ) ( Juarascio et al. , 2010 ) . The principal investigator 's dissertation examine whether addition ACT group treatment usual ( TAU ) residential treatment facility eat disorder could improve treatment outcome Those ACT condition show great reduction global eating pathology discharge ( measure Eating Disorder Examination ) , despite fact ACT group one dozen treatment group patient receive residential stay ( Juarascio et al. , 2013 ) . Although WS formally assess , trend observe PI 's dissertation study individual low start weight ( likely high WS ) show great improvement global EDE score ACT+TAU condition . Study Objectives- - Test feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy Nutritional Counseling And Acceptance-based Therapy ( N-CAAT ) bulimia nervosa ( BN ) small pilot RCT trial - Assess mechanisms action enhance treatment development - Evaluate feasibility recruitment , randomization , retention , assessment procedure , implementation novel treatment enhance probability success subsequent large RCTs The current study evaluate hypothesis N-CAAT successfully improve hypothesized clinical target ( e.g . distress tolerance , rigid dieting , weight suppression , biomarkers associate metabolic efficiency test hypothesis improvement distress tolerance , rigid dieting , weight suppression , biomarkers metabolic efficiency associate improvement BN symptom .</detailed_description>
