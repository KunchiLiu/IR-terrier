	<brief_title>Prebiotics Microbiota Composition Functionality Rural Burkinabe Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The central role gut microbiota immunity nutritional homeostasis acknowledge , albeit fully understood . Gut microbiota composition imbalance find malnourished child , restore nutritional intervention currently conduct . Therefore , necessity design complete nutritional intervention include gut health advise expert committee . Prebiotics compound selectively enhance growth beneficial gut bacteria . They recommend use infant formula wean cereal result gut microbiota resemble breastfed infant formula feed infant develop country . A healthy gut microbiota show associate enhanced growth pattern decrease morbidity child develop country . Evidence outcome lack develop country , yet result would particularly valuable child setting , live rather poor sanitary condition environment characterize high infectious disease load , condition mostly explain high prevalence chronic malnutrition . This study aim assess effect 6 month ' supplementation lipid base nutrient supplement fortify fructo-oligosaccharides inulin microbiota diversity functionality rural Burkinabe infant , explore subsequent effect linear growth velocity morbidity .</detailed_description>
