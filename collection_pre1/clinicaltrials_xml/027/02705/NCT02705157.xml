	<brief_summary>Rationale : Bone metastases arise 50 % patient die carcinoma , increase 70 % patient breast prostate cancer . The lesion cause pain fracture , lead diminish quality life poorer survival . Current knowledge concern adequate , personalize treatment metastatic lesion long bone patient disseminate cancer insufficient inconclusive due lack large , prospective series patient report outcome measure . Objective : The OPTIMAL cohort aim describe quality life pain perception patient local treatment ( radiotherapy and/or surgery ) metastases long bone , entire cohort well specific treatment separately . With personalized treatment metastasis long bone base expect survival impending fracture risk provide order improve functioning quality life remain lifetime patient disseminate cancer . Study design : Observational , prospective , multicentre cohort study . Study population : All patient metastasis long bone visit radiation oncologist orthopaedic surgeon . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary endpoint patient report quality life ( include function ) pain level . Complications survival secondary endpoint . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients OPTIMAL cohort perhaps directly benefit participation . Participation contribute derive patient-specific treatment modality future patient bone metastasis long bone . Risks associated participation prospective cohort consider negligible due observational nature study . The burden patient lie completion questionnaire , consider proportion potential value research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The OPTIMAL Study - A Prospective Cohort Patients With Bone Metastases Long Bones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OPTIMAL Study entirety aim provide personalize treatment metastasis long bone base expect survival impending fracture risk order improve functioning quality life remain lifetime patient disseminate cancer . The OPTIMAL Study provide infrastructure prospective cohort ( OPTIMAL cohort ) multiple independent trial . The specific aim cohort discuss protocol . The objective plan first trial ( Post-Operative Radiotherapy ; PORT study ) discuss separate protocol . The primary aim cohort describe quality life pain perception patient local treatment ( radiotherapy and/or surgery ) metastases long bone , entire cohort well specific treatment separately . Secondary aim describe complication rate survival patient local treatment ( radiotherapy and/or surgery ) metastases long bone . The specific aim future individual trial describe separate protocol submit medical research ethic committee ( METC ) independently . In general however , trial pragmatic research trial search answer treatment ( radiotherapy surgery ) fit specific patient ( categorised metastasis location , expect survival fracture risk ) best . STUDY DESIGN The cohort prospectively collect multicentre , include consecutive patient bone metastasis long bone ( BMLB ) sign informed consent . These patient follow prospectively , data concern patient treatment characteristic well patient report outcome quality life collect . Baseline data collect physician enter OPTIMAL database . These baseline data match information obtain standard care . For assessment patient report outcomes set internationally nationally validated questionnaire use . At moment inclusion baseline patient data collect OPTIMAL cohort , also use Post-Operative RadioTherapy ( PORT ) study . Data comprehend information concern demographic , medical history , clinical status functioning . Details concern treatment ( ) report relevant . Patients invite fill questionnaire quality life ( QoL ) baseline ( pre-treatment ; possible ) , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 week initial treatment , every six month minimal two year death . All subsequently concomitantly symptomatic metastasis register ( include treatment follow-up ) , new course questionnaire generally initiate . These outcome measure apply entire OPTIMAL cohort . Pain : Pain choose primary endpoint act proxy mechanical complication ( i.e . loosening ) . Mechanical complication relevant patient give clinical complaint need treatment . To measure primary endpoint patient ask score bad pain past 24 hour numeric rating scale ( NRS ) 0-10 . In addition , patient ask list usual pain medication escape medication use previous 24 hour . These question derive Brief Pain Intervention ( BPI ) score , advise International Consensus Statement Bone Metastasis Research . The BPI pain assessment tool use cancer patient develop Pain Research Group World Health Organization ( WHO ) Collaborating Centre Symptom Evaluation Cancer Care also available Dutch . However , multiple question similar question European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality life questionnaire palliation ( QLQ-PAL15 ) EORTC Quality life questionnaire bone metastasis ( QLQBM-22 ) ( describe ) . Thus spare patient answer question twice , investigator select 2 question BPI . Quality life : For longitudinal assessment quality life treatment , investigator use nationally internationally use , validate recommended questionnaire : European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ-C15-PAL EORTC QLQ-BM22 . In addition , EQ-5D ( 5 dimension ) questionnaire conduct . The EORTC currently develop utility score instrument EORTC QLQ-C30 ( QLQ-C15-PAL originates ) . The investigator expect score instrument also applicable QLQ-C15-PAL . After validation score instrument take place , investigator plan apply data . This would make addition EQ-5D questionnaire redundant withdrawn . Function : For assess improvement functional outcome treatment , Toronto Extremity Salvage Score ( TESS ) upper low extremity use . Observational clinical data collect baseline ( pre-treatment ; possible ) first , possibly second , post-operative follow-up ( generally , patient subsequently see complication new complaint ) : Complications : For complication rate , Henderson classification complication apply . This classification identify five primary mode endoprosthetic failure : soft tissue failure ( type 1 ) , aseptic loosening ( type 2 ) , structural failure ( type 3 ) , infection ( type 4 ) , tumour progression ( type 5 ) . Wound complication clinical consequence register separately . Re-operations due complication register treatment field new operation . Radiological status : Progression BMLB monitor conventional radiography indication CT scan . This accord usual care , generally six week 3 month . No additional outpatient visit image request study purpose . The radiological image use place subjective report pain ( report patient numeric rating scale ) perspective . Survival : Dates death derive Hospital Electronic Patient Registry , link Municipal Personal Records Database . If possible date , data derive general practitioner . The utmost try prevent sending questionnaire decease patient .</detailed_description>
