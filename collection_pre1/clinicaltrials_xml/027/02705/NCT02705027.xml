	<detailed_description>The use probe nasojejunal increasingly become important especially critically ill patient beneficial effect patient e.g . necrotizing pancreatitis , accord trauma major surgical procedure . A direct application jejunal tube feed necessary especially patient gastroparesis due exist diabetes mellitus , postoperative severe underlie disease . Since jejunal tube feeding , secretion gastric juice increase , use probe allow : jejunal nutrition , well gastric outflow secretion beneficial . While randomized trial Schwab et al . could show use Freka-Trilumina® compare Dobbhoff probe so-called drag technique significantly faster currently comparative data use Easy-In® probe subsequently develop , directly introduce work channel endoscope , thus shorten procedure time . In presented study investigate extent use import directly via work channel Easy-Inn® probe , application time thus investigation period may shorten compare usual nasojenunal probe .</detailed_description>
