	<criteria>Subjects must meet following criterion : 1 . Written sign informed consent . 2 . Age ≥ 18 year time study entry . 3 . Subjects must receive progressed , refractory , intolerant standard therapy appropriate specific tumor type . Subjects receive 3 prior line systemic therapy recurrent metastatic . 4 . Subjects doseescalation phase , must histologic documentation advance solid tumor , exclude primary CNS tumor hematologic malignancy . 5 . Subjects doseexpansion phase , must histologic diagnosis advance relapsed refractory solid tumor specify protocol . 6 . Subjects receive prior therapy regimens contain CTLA 4 , PD L1 , PD 1 antagonist permit enroll additional protocol criterion meet . 7 . Subjects must least 1 lesion measurable use RECIST guideline . 8 . Subjects must consent provide archived tumor specimen correlative biomarker study . In set archival material unavailable unsuitable use , subject must consent undergo fresh tumor biopsy . 9 . All subject encourage consent provide pretreatment treatment tumor biopsy . 10 . ECOG Performance score 0 1 11 . In opinion investigator likely complete ≥ 8 week treatment . 12 . Adequate hematologic , renal hepatic function determine blood laboratory value . 13 . At time Day 1 study , subject CNS metastasis must treat must asymptomatic meet following : 1 . No concurrent treatment , inclusive , limited surgery , radiation , and/or corticosteroid 2 . At least 42 day without progression CNS metastases evidence magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) last day treatment 3 . At least 14 day since last dose corticosteroid Note : Subjects leptomeningeal disease cord compression exclude study . 14 . Female subject childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use least 1 highly effective method contraception screening , must agree continue use precaution 180 day final dose investigational product . 15 . Nonsterilized male subject sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use male condom plus , locally available , spermicide Day 1 180 day receipt final dose investigational product . Any follow would exclude subject participation study : 1 . Prior treatment TNFRSF agonists include limited OX40 , CD27 , CD137 ( 41BB ) , CD357 , GITR 2 . History severe allergic reaction unknown allergen component study drug formulation 3 . Active prior document autoimmune disease within past 2 year . 4 . Concurrent enrollment another clinical study , unless observational clinical study follow period interventional study 5 . Receipt conventional investigational anticancer therapy otherwise specify within 28 day prior first dose MEDI0562 durvalumab tremelimumab combination treatment ; case mAbs , 28 day 5 half life , whichever short , prior first dose MEDI0562 durvalumab tremelimumab combination treatment 6 . Any concurrent chemotherapy , IMT , biologic hormonal therapy cancer treatment . 7 . Unresolved toxicity prior anticancer therapy . 8 . Systemic therapeutic anticoagulation daily aspirin dose exceed 325 mg/per day . 9 . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 14 day prior first dose MEDI0562 . The following exception criterion : 1 . Intranasal , inhale , topical steroid , local steroid injection ( e.g. , intraarticular injection ) 2 . Systemic corticosteroid physiologic dos exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent 3 . Steroids premedication hypersensitivity reaction ( e.g. , CT scan premedication ) 10 . History primary immunodeficiency , solid organ transplantation , tuberculosis 11 . Test result indicate active infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis B C define positive serologic test confirmatory viral nucleic acid test 12 . Receipt live , attenuated vaccine within 28 day prior first dose investigational product . 13 . Pregnant breastfeed woman 14 . Major surgery within 4 week prior first dose MEDI0562 still recover prior surgery . 15 . Other invasive malignancy within 2 year except noninvasive malignancy cervical carcinoma situ , nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin ductal carcinoma situ breast has/have surgically cure 16 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active peptic ulcer disease gastritis , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement , substantially increase risk incur AEs combination MEDI0562 durvalumab tremelimumab , compromise ability subject give write informed consent . 17 . Any condition , opinion investigator , would interfere evaluation investigational product interpretation subject safety study result .</criteria>
