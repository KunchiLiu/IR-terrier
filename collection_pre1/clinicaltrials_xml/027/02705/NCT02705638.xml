	<brief_title>Treatment IgG4-Related Disease With Revlimid Rituximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunoglobulin G subclass 4 Related Disease ( IgG4-RD ) recently recognize systemic fibroinflammatory condition . Various manifestation IgG4-RD previously recognize individual organ system , entity ( include autoimmune pancreatitis , orbital pseudotumor , Reidel 's thyroiditis , retroperitoneal fibrosis , idiopathic sialadenitis dacryoadenitis , etc ) recognize manifestation common disease process affect organ system . IgG4-RD characterized distinctive histologic finding tissue infiltration IgG4-positive plasma cell together storiform fibrosis obliterative phlebitis . Both clinical pathologic consensus diagnostic criterion define . Serum IgG4 concentration biomarker IgG4-RD elevate 70 % 90 % patient active disease .</detailed_description>
