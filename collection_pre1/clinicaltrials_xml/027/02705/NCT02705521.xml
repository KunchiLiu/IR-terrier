	<brief_summary>This randomise prospective control trial investigate patient impingement syndrome undergo arthroscopic subacromial decompression . The intervention group receive physiotherapy aid automate sensor-based technology help perform exergames track rehabilitation progress . The control group treat standard physiotherapy protocol . The two group compare use patient report outcome measure assessment shoulder range movement shoulder surgery . Data collect patient experience , engagement rehabilitation process usability sensor-based technology use exergames . This guide development method quantify patient activation engagement . Hypothesis : 1 . There significant clinical difference post-surgical improvement measure patient report outcomes physiotherapy aid automate sensor-based technology perform Exergames track progress , compare standard physiotherapy protocol . 2 . There significant difference post-surgical improvement range shoulder movement patient improvement , measure patient report out-comes physiotherapy aid automate sensor-based technology perform exergames track progress , compare standard physiotherapy protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-centre , Randomised , Controlled Study Comparing Gamification With Remote Monitoring Against Standard Rehabilitation , Patients After Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Musculoskeletal problem one common reason seek medical advice , estimate 20 % adult annually consult general practitioner . The prevalence shoulder problem population approximately 2.5 % ( Jordon et al 2010 ) . In 2012/13 , 7.1 million outpatient appointment trauma orthopaedics England ( account 9.3 % outpatient attendance ) 4 million visit followup initial consultation ( Hospital Episode Statistics ) . The average cost outpatient follow £76 . At time NHS considerable financial burden constantly look way mean reduce number outpatient appointment length time patient require followup . By improve rehabilitation protocol patient may complete recovery rapidly may reduce clinician patient face-to-face interaction . This may free valuable resource direct towards complex clinical requirement . Patient Engagement : One major factor influence patient outcome engagement rehabilitation program . Rehabilitation professional long suspect patient 's motivation play important role determine outcome therapy , despite lack clear definition phenomenon ( Maclean et al . 2002 ) . It estimate 65 % patient non/partially adherent home exercise program ( Meichenbaum 1987 ) . Classically , patient complete home exercise diary . However , study suggest often complete retrospectively . This may encourage patient exaggerate amount activity perform . Hoelscher al ( 1984 ) , time patient home perform relaxation exercise program compare patient report duration . They find latter tend suggest high level adherence . The Exergames programme actively track patient interaction software . Each activity record length interaction , progress rehabilitation allow clinician clearer indication patient engagement rehabilitation . Patient activation describes knowledge , skill confidence person manage health health care . Intervening increase activation improve patient 's engagement health outcome . This important factor help patient manage health ( Kings Fund 2015 ) . As part study quantify patient engagement . Through develop validate new tool comprehensively measure patient outcome use four domain . These Patient report pain function ( P ) , shoulder range movement i.e . Kinematics ( K ) , patient activation engagement ( E ) patient experience ( X ) . Gamification : Traditional evaluation patient 's range motion usually occur clinic , often use subjective informal method angle measurement . This potential create discrepancy finding clinician . To reduce use healthcare resource , make clinical assessment convenient patient , improve quality information collect assessment conduct , electronic measurement potential perform repeatable validated objective result . If combine appropriate principle gamification , measurement become part rehabilitation process potentially faster clinical improvement comprehensive analysis patient generate outcome . In light , wave support implementation game element healthcare technology . 'Gamification ' involves incorporation game mechanic non-game setting tailor user interface well learning encourages engagement ( King 2013 ) . Reward system , competition immediate feedback improve user experience implement healthcare relate field patient become niche target group ( Lin 2013 ) . This may turn increase patient activation allow manage health . MIRA : MIRA Rehab company develop software design rehabilitation medical condition . Combined Microsoft Kinect sensor accurately trace range motion shoulder . MIRA use game build base upon best clinical practice expertise specialist clinician . The MIRA programme enable patient progress different level within game whilst engage rehabilitation programme . Research Design Methodology : Methodology : 90 patient recruit 3 month rehabilitation programme follow standard subacromial decompression +/biceps tenotomy impingement syndrome . Patients randomise two group : 1 . Standard postoperative physiotherapy regime without use accessory software ( Treatment usual Group ) . 2 . Postoperative regime physiotherapy plus Exergames utilizing principle gamification . Power calculation : A sample size calculation perform use Oxford Shoulder Score ( OSS ) sample data collect patient previously undergo arthroscopic subacromial decompression . [ Alpha error set 0.05 , beta error 0.8 , mean difference 5 points12 OSS , standard deviation 6.96 ] Based upon , sample size 32 patient group would require . A second sample size calculation perform base disability arm shoulder hand ( DASH ) outcome measure . [ Alpha error set 0.05 , beta error 0.8 , mean difference 15 point DASH13 , standard deviation 23 ] Based upon , sample size 37 patient group would require . Therefore , target 45 patient per group choose allow participant withdraw study ( 20 % ) . Treatment usual Group : Patients attend physiotherapy weekly basis assessment . They assess progression provide home exercise program . Range motion shoulder collect weekly basis use MIRA technology . Patients require complete exercise diary documenting exercise perform well duration frequency . Treatment usual plus Exergames Group : Prior commence study physiotherapist set initially demonstrate Exergames intervention participant home setting . This ensure safety patient address technological issue may arise . Patients attend physiotherapy weekly basis well partake set tailor Exergames play home system . The MIRA software record patient engagement system include number session duration play . Patients also ask complete exercise diary . VISIT SUMMARY Baseline ( Clinic Consultation ) : Patient 's eligibility participate study assessed; inclusion/ exclusion criterion must meet . The Patient Information Sheet give patient list surgery . Prior surgery date , patient contact member research team , see would like participate study . Patient ask give consent study day surgery . Past medical history review patient demographic document . Relevant question score take baseline reference . + 24 hour ( follow baseline assessment ) The patient report outcome measure questionnaire repeat patient . Day 1 Patient attends hospital surgical treatment . Confirmation study consent must confirm . A study diary dispense patient . Study coordinator give full explanation regard completion diary . Day 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77 . Patient must attend physiotherapy clinic day 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77 . A scheduled visit window allow flexibility +/- 2 day . Patient continue post-operative physiotherapy regime depend treatment group randomise . Range Movement assess document research physiotherapist . Each patient diary review assessed . Day 84/85 Patient diary review return . On completion 12 week programme patient ( N=90 ) complete outcome questionnaire , Patients randomise Exergames arm complete Systems Usability score MIRA software . Range movement record MIRA document research physio-therapist . Day 365 One year post surgery patient ( N=90 ) complete score questionnaire .</detailed_description>
