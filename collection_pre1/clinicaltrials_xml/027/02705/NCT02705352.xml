	<brief_summary>Full thickness skin graft essential tool surgery around eyelid reconstruction rehabilitation follow injury surgery . Common condition skin graft need include cicatricial ectropion , restoration eyelid function tumor removal , burn eyelid , trauma . Early complication , occur first 2 week surgery , rare : wound dehiscence , necrosis , infection , bleeding , partial complete graft failure . However , late postoperative complication generally categorize `` scar '' ( include graft hypertrophy contraction , keloid formation , hypo/hyper pigmentation ) limit success acceptability procedure patient . Scars form follow insult deep dermis result wound healing . Factors age , skin type , racial pigmentation , genetics , sex may influence fibroblast proliferation part heal response , result suboptimal result . Graft contraction perhaps worrisome result , since result failure initial surgery may require additional surgery correct . Many treatment use manage complication : corticosteroid injection , cryotherapy , pressure therapy , radiotherapy , laser therapy , silicone base product , antimetabolite therapy . One antimetabolite , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , use last 15 year adjunct primary treatment modulate wound heal scar formation . Other study demonstrate safety cutaneous subcutaneous injection periocular region . However , control study exist . This prospective , randomize , double-blinded clinical study evaluate use benefit 5-FU versus saline patient undergoing skin graft periocular reconstruction . The decision need skin graft discretion attend surgeon make separate enrollment study . Surgery perform indicate . The study medication placebo ( normal saline ) administer 2-3 week surgery every 2-3 week afterwards total 4 injection . After injection , regular schedule follow-up 3 , 6 , 12 month post-op . Outcomes study visit ( 12 month post-operatively ) include graft size , color , contour , complication study treatment group placebo group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In oculofacial surgery , full thickness skin graft fundamental tool use restore function eyelid . This required removal skin cancer , correction eyelid malposition cicatricial eyelid ectropion ( eyelid edge pull away eye ) , retraction ( eyelid pull low normal , expose eye air ) , scar formation ( medial pull web ) , trauma loss tissue . These condition affect patient age , range newborn nonagenarian . Skin graft periorbital area relatively safe , although complication may arise . The common challenging complication scar graft shrinkage . This lead require additional surgery add additional skin improve appearance graft . In addition morbidity another surgery , patient limit additional skin available ( e.g . young patient , burn patient ) . The eyelid skin thin body , thin skin use donor material . However , amount skin available purpose little . There limited option prevent graft shrinkage scar situation . The old commonly use technique injection steroid medication . Steroids decrease proliferation fibroblast cell , create collagen glycosaminoglycan , two protein create body contract cause graft shrinkage . Data literature show one form steroid , triamcinolone , effective purpose . However , risk embolization solid steroid material care rarely cause blindness . In addition , periocular area , steroid elevate eye ( intraocular ) pressure ( cause glaucoma case ) accelerate formation cataract . Another medication use purpose 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . This antimetabolite ( drug inhibit another chemical part normal process ) work irreversibly inhibit enzyme thymidylate synthetase result impaired DNA synthesis . This reduce fibroblast proliferation inhibits collagen type 1 production key protein scar formation . This medication commonly use ophthalmology glaucoma filtration surgery . In usage , inject conjunctiva prevent scar around surgical site . There two retrospective study investigate safety efficacy 5-FU injected periorbital skin graft without Kenalog . The first ( Massry 2011 ) use post-operative injection 50:50 mixture 5-FU triamcinolone correction medial canthal web . In 2 patient , find safe effective . The author note use previously scar management case `` pleased result [ ] negligible side-effect [ ] . '' The author perform another study use 5-FU skin graft . This study evaluate 19 patient skin graft various purpose inject follow surgery ( similar protocol ) . This study demonstrate safety injection , case complication . The author conclude 5-FU effective `` minimal scarring , high patient surgeon satisfaction , complication . '' However , comparison group truly evaluate effect . With two retrospective study author , strong evidence effective , although safety demonstrate . The investigator therefore propose randomize control prospective study evaluate outcome periocular skin graft without use 5-FU injected post-operative period . Patients recruit investigator ' practice need full thickness skin graft reconstruction cancer removal , pre-existing scarring , eyelid malposition , trauma . Patients introduce study , come back detailed explanation consent . The injection medication prepare Mass Eye Ear Research Pharmacy label double-blinded study . Injections give 2-3 week surgery 4 time ( also every 2-3 week ) . Measurements photographs skin graft take visit ( follow injection , 3 , 6 , 12 month ) monitor complication . Patients follow least 12 month . If effective , medication could change post-operative management skin graft , reduce complication reoperations .</detailed_description>
