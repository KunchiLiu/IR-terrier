	<brief_summary>The purpose study see LOAd703 ( oncolytic adenovirus ) safely give patient pancreatic cancer . The study also evaluate whether intratumoral injection LOAd703 support current standard care treatment reduce size tumor improve survival patient . Adenoviruses know `` common cold '' virus individual multiple infection lifetime . Oncolytic adenovirus adenovirus modify multiply spread ( know replicate ) properly normal ( e.g . healthy ) cell , instead , infect replicate well cancer cell . This strong replication lead death cancer cell . Oncolytic virus evaluate multiple clinical trial cancer treatment past decade proven safe . It common fever first day two virus injection since immune system react virus infection . The immune system also kill cancer cell need properly stimulate . Oncolytic virus alone seem strong enough activate clinically relevant anti-cancer response . However , think additional immune system stimulators add oncolytic virus may able result clinical relevant antic-cancer response . LOAd703 oncolytic adenovirus modify include additional immune system stimulators . Specifically , gene stimulate immune system add oncolytic adenovirus . Once oncolytic adenovirus infects cancer cell , gene express , result activation immune response attack kill cancer cell . In study , LOAd703 give intratumoral injection . It give addition standard care treatment gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel . Because LOAd703 experimental therapy , extra visit disease monitor sample accordingly detailed information . The LOAd703 investigational agent approve FDA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research conduct Baylor College Medicine ( BCM ) Baylor St. Luke 's Medical Center ( BSLMC ) . All patient receive standard care treatment pancreatic cancer . Standard care treatment gemcitabine combination nab-paclitaxel give day 1 , 8 , 15 28 day cycle . LOAd703 treatment initiate day 15 first cycle give every week 6 dos . Depending location tumor injection LOAd703 give different way . The common route injection ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection , endoscopic ultrasound-guidance use patient appropriate . All patient receive anti-anxiety drug sedation need comfort procedure . This study evaluate different dos LOAd703 . All patient receive six injection LOAd703 . Phase I patient : All six injection LOAd703 do BCM/BSLMC . The patient stay BSLMC night evaluation first two dos LOAd703 . As tolerated , patient may allow leave hospital soon 4 hour LOAd703 injection . Simultaneously LOAd703 treatment , last LOAd703 injection , patient continue receive standard care treatment . Phase IIa patient : All six injection LOAd703 do BCM/BSLMC . During phase study Before first sixth six LOAd703 injection , biopsy take tumor ( percutaneous needle biopsy endoscopic procedure depend method LOAd703 administration ) . Simultaneously LOAd703 treatment , last LOAd703 injection , patient continue receive standard care treatment . Follow-up visit : Besides visit receive standard care treatment , patient continue visit BCM/BSLMC local doctor evaluation health status side effect . At visit blood sample obtain . Some blood sample obtain consider standard care ensure patient safety standard care treatment LOAd703 injection . However , blood biopsy sample ( applicable patient ) collect analyzed presence LOAd703 , tumor marker immunology marker . The extra blood 5-15 ml ( 3 teaspoonful ) blood collect screen visit eight different time point treatment LOAd703 injection complete . Imaging tumor determine tumor size do every two three month , routine monitoring patient pancreatic cancer . Patient participation study last 9 month . After final follow-up visit do , participation trial complete patient continue receive routine care .</detailed_description>
