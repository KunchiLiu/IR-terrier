	<brief_summary>The investigator research see use small tissue sample fluid develop test determine tissue sample relate related . The test use patient 's DNA , part unique genetic material carry instruction body 's development function . Cancer result change person 's genetic material cause cell divide uncontrolled way , sometimes , travel organ . Currently , researcher doctor know genetic change cause cancer , know genetic change cause cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Test Treatment Multifocal Lung Cancers Using Genome Sequencing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A frequent clinical dilemma lung cancer care management multifocal lung cancer . The management decision base determine multiple cancer represent true independent primary cancer related metastasis . This determination critical appropriate stag cancer treatment . Indeed , distinction represent difference aggressive local therapy either surgery radiation therapy primary early stage lesion , palliative chemotherapy best supportive care appropriate symptom management advance stage metastatic disease . No exist pathologic molecular test currently capable make distinction multiple independent lung primary metastatic disease accuracy . The recent release preliminary data NLST screen trial , suggest survival benefit screen high risk patient CT scanning , increase number patient face treatment dilemma . The research team recently develop test allow distinction great accuracy . This test allow determination lineage two tumor use identification large genomic rearrangement use mate pair next generation sequencing ( MP ) . The test develop use fresh frozen tissue resect lung tumor currently validate clinical test . The investigator ' goal develop test use cytology small biopsy specimen .</detailed_description>
