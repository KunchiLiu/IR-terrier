	<brief_summary>Single arm one stage Phase II study : post 4-6 cycle platinum doublet chemotherapy patient metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) offer Pembrolizumab maintenance therapy non-progressors primary endpoint : Immune Related Progression Free Survival ( irPFS ) 1 year . Aim show least 25 % ( compare expect 12 % 1 year PFS base Pemetrexed Erlotinib maintenance trial ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switch Maintenance Pembrolizumab Patients With NSCLC After First Line Platinum Doublet Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : There currently data maintenance therapy PD1/PDL1 inhibitor NSCLC . After initial response / stable disease first line chemotherapy , non progressors / candidate maintenance treatment , represent ideal set / patient group test efficacy Pembrolizumab give chemotherapy result antigen release , hence potential augment immune checkpoint blockade , follow disease cytoreduction , represent low disease burden setting , may suit checkpoint inhibition well give recent study Prostate cancer Ipilimumab Melanoma Pembrolizumab ( suggest well outcomes patient less extensive disease ) . Primary endpoint : percentage patient progress 1 year use immune related radiological criterion . All patient treat fix dose 200mg iv Pembrolizumab unacceptable toxicity , disease progression completion 2 year therapy . Statistical Analysis Plan Summary The study employ one stage phase II Fleming 's design use irPFS 1 year primary endpoint . Using response hypothesis H0 &lt; 12 % Ha &gt; 25 % i.e . irPFS 1 year maintenance Pembrolizumab arm 25 % , compare 12 % normal chemotherapy maintenance arm , significance level ( i.e. , probability reject H0 true ) α=0.05 power ( i.e . probability decide regimen active ) 0.8 true response rate 25 % , 48 patient require enter study . Entry Criteria Diagnosis/Condition Entry Trial In order eligible trial entry , patient must diagnosis metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer , progress first line palliative chemotherapy platinum doublet . They receive six ( 6 ) cycle platinum doublet chemotherapy , able receive treatment within three ( 3 ) six ( 6 ) week last chemotherapy administration .</detailed_description>
