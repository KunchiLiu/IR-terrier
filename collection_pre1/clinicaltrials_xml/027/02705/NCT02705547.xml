	<detailed_description>Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) progressive neurodegenerative disease child adult presently therapy . Much current work FRDA aim find new target drug therapy . Recent work University Pennsylvania discover serum ApoA-1 protein level low people FRDA compare control level . ApoA-1 main protein find high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol individual FRDA frequently low HDL level ; current study propose assess administration HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor 3 month alters ApoA-1 protein level FRDA . Although significance ApoA-1 level among FRDA patient currently unknown , study propose exploratory study examine protein . If ApoA-1 protein level increase course treatment , future study may additionally focus examine potential therapeutic treatment .</detailed_description>
