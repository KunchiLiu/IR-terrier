	<criteria>Male female subject least 18 75 year time screening ; Subjects must FLOLAN therapy pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) approve product label ; Subjects must receive FLOLAN therapy 45 nanogram ( ng ) /kilogram ( kg ) /minute ( min ) high ; Subjects must stable dos exist FLOLAN treatment minimum one month prior screen ; acceptable adjust within 10 % dose last one month period ; Subjects must stable dos current PAH treatment FLOLAN therapy last 30 day prior screen ; Subjects meet following : A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative [ serum urine ] human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females follow : document tubal ligation , document hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , document bilateral oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] estradiol level consistent menopause ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) 30 day prior first dose thermostable formulation FLOLAN therapy completion followup visit . Subject must agree participate clinical study involve another investigational drug device throughout study ; Subjects must competent understand information give Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) approve informed consent form must sign form prior initiation study procedure . Subjects give FLOLAN therapy condition manner outside approve indication . Subjects congestive heart failure arise severe leave ventricular dysfunction . Subjects , without supplemental oxygen , rest arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) &lt; 90 % measure pulse oximetry screen . Subjects hospitalise emergency visit emergency room condition related PAH treatment PAH last 3 month . The subject 's clinical condition expect remain clinically stable duration study . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Subjects demonstrate noncompliance previous medical regimen . Subjects history abuse alcohol illicit drug within 1 year .
