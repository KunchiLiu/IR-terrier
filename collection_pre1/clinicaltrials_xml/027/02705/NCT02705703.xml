	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens ( TAPA ) pulse dendritic cell injection potential consolidation therapy patient metastatic solid malignancy ( SM ) . The investigator hypothesize treatment patient metastatic SM demonstrate tumor response , whose disease remain stable , conventional first-line systemic therapy AND lack available , potentially curative therapeutic intervention whose tumor cell and/or blood express least one ( 1 ) TAPA define panel TAPAs result TAPA-specific T-cell response without significant toxicity . The investigator also hypothesize CD4+ CD8+ T-cell response generate specific TAPAs may translate clinical antitumor activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose metastatic solid malignancy ( SM ) , respond whose disease remain stable follow first line systemic therapy , without available , potential curative therapeutic option , candidate Phase I/II study . Potentially eligible patient agree participate sign consent form neoplastic cell and/or blood analyzed expression specific panel Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens ( TAPAs ) , include Sp17 , ropporin , AKAP-4 , PTTG1 , Span-xb , Her-2/neu , HM1.24 , NY-ESO-1 MAGE-1 . Patients whose tumor express one ( 1 ) TAPAs receive three ( 3 ) day subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) increase bone marrow production monocyte dendritic cell ( DC ) precursor , whole blood obtain phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis generation autologous DCs . Patient 's DCs generate Kiromic 's Cell Processing Good Manufacturing Process ( GMP ) facility , accord establish Standard Operating Procedures , activate pulsing/loading TAPA ( ) relevant particular patient . Patients receive five ( 5 ) day low-dose cyclophosphamide prior vaccination TAPA-pulsed DCs decrease Treg activity . TAPA-pulsed DCs administer fix dose 1 X 107 DCs least two ( 2 ) day follow cyclophosphamide administration . DC vaccination schedule every fourteen ( 14 ) day via subcutaneous ( SC ) intradermal ( ID ) injection total 6 vaccination . Low dose GM-CSF also administer SC five ( 5 ) consecutive day , start three ( 3 ) six ( 6 ) hour TAPA-pulsed DC treatment , optimize immune response . Patients follow weekly basis ( frequently require ) evaluate treatment-related toxicity . Immune response anti-tumor response evaluate per protocol specification . Continuation stop rule study define base toxicity/tolerability ( Phase I ) and/or immune response ( Phase II ) .</detailed_description>
