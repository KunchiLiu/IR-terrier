	<brief_summary>Dietary biomarkers compound biofluids directly reflect intake specific food food group . Their exploration use field dietary assessment could provide objective measure actual intake complement classical assessment method ( e.g . food frequency questionnaire , 24h recall ) . To date , limited number food cover validated biomarkers . The study part international project `` The Food Biomarker Alliance ( FOODBALL ) '' . The study describe assigned ass biomarkers intake milk cheese . Up , evident lack data specific validate biomarkers milk cheese ( dairy product ) , belong relevant public health relate food Europe . This study provide novel insight influence fermentation milk-based food metabolic effect postprandial adaptation , yet study depth use cheese fermented product . Outcomes support expand early finding correlation intake ferment dairy product intake human health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Dietary Biomarkers Metabolic Effects After Intake Milk Cheese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This acute , randomize , control , cross-over study design identify dietary biomarkers milk cheese intake ass metabolic effect ingestion non-fermented product ( milk ) ferment product ( cheese ) healthy subject . Twelve healthy participant ( six woman , six men ) fast state consume three different food randomize order three different study day . Two day prior dietary intervention , run-in period initiate , participant follow restrict diet . Participants receive standardise meal last dinner run-in phase . The meal serve day dietary intervention lunch dinner ( period control diet ) . Before ingestion test food , blood sample urine sample collect ( 6 hour ) . Additionally , 24h-samples collect . Primary outcome ( metabolite ) measure blood serum plasma collect 6 different time point urine collect 7 different time point . Transcriptomics analysis perform whole blood sample collect 4 time point clinical chemistry parameter assess blood sample withdraw 6 different time point .</detailed_description>
