Patients HER2 positive , metastatic incurable recurrent breast cancer , follow disease progression , , treatment least one systemic treatment regimen metastatic recurrent setting , treat copanlisib ( 30 , 45 60 mg flat dose IV weekly - depend maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine Phase Ib part study ) plus trastuzumab ( 4 mg/kg IV Cycle 1 Day 1 2 mg/kg IV weekly start day 8 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/II Trial coPANlisib Combination With Trastuzumab HER2-positive Breast Cancer . ( Panther Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase Ib One three dose level copanlisib assign registration accord dose escalation scheme . Phase II The copanlisib dose Phase II part trial base MTD establish Phase Ib part study . Clinical laboratory parameter assess evaluate disease response toxicity study therapy . Safety assessment perform throughout study . Efficacy assessment ( radiological examination ) perform patient every 8 week first 24 week every 12 week thereafter . Following baseline cardiac assessment , cardiac safety monitor include physical exam ( New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification patient diagnose congestive heart failure ) cycle , Multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) 12 lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) within 7 day Day 1 every third cycle start cycle 3 ( Cycle 3 , Cycle 6 , etc . ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Adult woman ≥18 year age histologically confirm , recurrent , metastatic , HER2positive breast cancer . Eligible recurrent disease recurrent disease consider incurable treat oncologist . Many local recurrence treat curative intent ; treatment plan curative intent local recurrence would indicate patient eligible clinical trial . A local recurrence must consider incurable treat oncologist patient eligible . 2 . Documented HER2 overexpression local laboratory ( IHC 3+ FISH CISH positive ) . 3 . At least one measurable lesion accord RECIST criterion ( Version 1.1 ) . Patients bone disease eligible . 4 . Patient receive least one trastuzumab base TDM1based treatment regimen set metastatic disease incurable locoregional recurrence . A trastuzumab base TDM1based treatment regimen consider treatment regimen include trastuzumab TDM1 . Patients must least 1 line therapy metastatic and/or incurable locoregional recurrent disease eligible . A patient eligible regardless period time adjuvant therapy long disease progress least 1 line trastuzumabbased therapy set metastatic disease and/or incurable locoregional recurrence . 5 . Disease progression follow recent anticancer therapy . 6 . ECOG performance status ≤2 . 7 . Life expectancy least 3 month . 8 . Availability fresh tissue and/or archival tumour tissue screen . 9 . Women childbearing potential must agree use highly effective method contraception sexually active . This apply sign inform consent form least 100 day last study drug administration . The investigator designate associate require advise patient achieve adequate birth control . Highly effective contraception define study method achieve failure rate le 1 % per year use consistently correctly . Such method include : combine ( oestrogen progestogen contain ) hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , intravaginal , transdermal ) progestogen hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , injectable implantable ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , intrauterine hormone release system ( IUS ) , bilateral tubal occlusion , successfully vasectomised partner sexual abstinence . In addition , use condom patient partner require unless woman hysterectomy . 10 . Adequate baseline laboratory value collect 14 day start study treatment : Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ( &lt; 3 x ULN patient liver involvement ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤2.5 x ULN ( ≤5 x ULN patient liver involvement breast cancer ) . Lipase ≤1.5 x ULN . Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2 accord Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) abbreviate formula . If target , evaluation may repeat least 24 hour either accord MDRD abbreviate formula 24 hour sampling . If later result within acceptable range , may use fulfil inclusion criterion instead . International normalized ratio ( INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤1.5 x ULN . Patients therapeutically treat agent warfarin heparin allow participate provide prior evidence underlie abnormality coagulation parameter exist . Close monitoring patient ( Day 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 cycle ) perform INR/PTT stable base measurement predose define local standard care . Platelet count ≥75 x 109/L .
