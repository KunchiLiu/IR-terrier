	<brief_summary>The purpose study clarify exist research early identification documentation suspect deep tissue injury ( sDTI ) . Basic principle physiology along prior research suggest sDTI quantifiable amount heat ( lack thereof ) relative surround tissue exhibit characteristic thermal signature ( temperature ) . These signature measure quantitatively record use long-wave infrared thermography ( LWIT ) identify sDTI , also learn pathophysiological evolution . Additionally , LWIT physiological data cross-compared gold standard visual assessment current standard wound evaluation .</brief_summary>
