	<brief_summary>Though patient whose tumor harbor EGFR T790M mutation appear benefit rociletinib , need understand molecular mechanism lead primary acquire resistance rociletinib . The investigator propose conduct clinical trial rociletinib patient EGFR-mutant NSCLC activate EGFR mutation ( include exon 19 deletion L858R mutation ) , without EGFR T790M mutation . In patient , pre-treatment post-progression biopsy specimen subject genomic analysis fully understand clonal evolution molecular mechanism underpin treatment resistance .</brief_summary>

At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL INR ≤ 2.0 Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Potassium within institutional limit ( supplementation allow ) Magnesium within normal limit ( supplementation allow ) Tumor tissue available deem adequate genomic study . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Currently receive investigational agent . Received therapeutic oral IV antibiotic within 2 week prior first day study treatment . Patients receive prophylactic antibiotic ( e.g. , prevent urinary tract infection chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation ) eligible . Symptomatic , untreated unstable central nervous system leptomeningeal metastasis . ( Patients treat stable brain metastasis ( confirm 2 scan least 4 week apart ) , evidence cavitation hemorrhage brain lesion eligible provide asymptomatic require corticosteroid . ) A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition rociletinib agent use study . Currently receive treatment medication potential prolong QT interval treatment discontinue switched different medication . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within previous 3 month , coronary angioplasty stenting bypass graft within past 6 month , cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History interstitial lung disease . History idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , organize pneumonia ( e.g. , bronchiolitis obliterans ) , druginduced pneumonitis , idiopathic pneumonitis , evidence active pneumonitis screen chest CT scan . History radiation pneumonitis radiation field ( fibrosis ) permit . Class II IV heart failure define New York Heart Association functional classification system . Patients know coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure meeting criterion , LVEF &lt; 50 % must stable medial regimen optimize opinion treat physician , consultation cardiologist appropriate , eligible . Any following cardiac abnormality history : Clinically significant abnormal 12lead ECG , QT interval correct use Fridericia 's method ( QTcF ) &gt; 450 msec Inability measure QT interval ECG Personal family history long QT syndrome Implantable pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator Resting bradycardia &lt; 55 beats/min Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction rociletinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) define positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) test screening . Patients past resolve HBV infection ( define negative HBsAg test positive antihepatitis B core antigen ( antiHBc ) antibody test ) eligible . HBV DNA must obtain patient prior first day study treatment . Active hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Patients positive HCV antibody eligible PCR negative HCV RNA . Active tuberculosis . Presence active GI disease ( include GI bleed ulceration ) condition could affect GI absorption ) ( e.g . malabsorption syndrome , history biliary tract disease ) .</criteria>
