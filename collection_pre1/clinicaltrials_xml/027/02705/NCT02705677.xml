	<brief_summary>The overarch purpose study advance understanding natural history Rett syndrome ( RTT ) , MECP2-duplication disorder ( MECP2 Dup ) , RTT-related disorder include CDKL5 , FOXG1 , individual MECP2 mutation RTT . Although disorder result specific genetic change , remain broad clinical variation entirely account known biological factor . Additionally , clinical investigator currently biomarkers disease status , clinical severity , responsiveness therapeutic intervention . To address issue , biological material ( DNA , RNA , plasma , cell line ) collect affected individual case unaffected family member , initial evaluation perform identify additional biological factor contribute disease severity , material store future characterization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present time , effective treatment RTT , MECP2 Dup , Rett-related disorder lack . Investigators make substantial progress RTT past eleven year study represent narrowing focus mutation duplication MECP2 gene related disorder , include phenotypic overlap . Understanding RTT advance remarkably well Rett Syndrome Natural History Clinical Protocol ( NHS ) correspondingly advancement basic science realm move forward equivalent success . Thus , progress clinical basic science lead establishment clinical trial translational study hold promise additional clinical trial future . In process , however , investigator become aware additional MECP2- RTT-related disorder unknown time original proposal conceive impressed substantial clinical variability individual RTT explain difference mutation alone . In fact , variability among individual identical mutation lead investigator search additional explanation . At time initial application ( 2002 ) , three year identification gene , MECP2 , molecular link RTT , investigator aware variation clinical disorder relate MECP2 mutation related quite different MECP2 Dup . Each disorder characterize significant neurodevelopmental feature relate either alteration MECP2 gene related phenotype closely resemble see individual RTT . Further , phenotypic overlap RTT due mutation CDKL5 FOXG1 also unexplored . The investigator propose new study build substantial progress make understanding classic variant RTT add related disorder , MECP2 Dup Rett-related disorder include CDKL5 , FOXG1 , individual MECP2 mutation RTT . In conjunction longitudinal clinical assessment perform via natural history component , investigator systematically collect willing participant 's blood isolate plasma , DNA , RNA . All participant Natural History Study ask contribute sample initial visit , whereas sample collect repeatedly subset participant order look change time . In order identify factor distinguish affect unaffected individual , well potential characterize heritability potential consequence genetic change family , sample collect unaffected family member . Additionally , subset individual choose unique clinical feature skin biopsy and/or hair follicle collect establish cell line . Investigators ask individual provide sample agree potential future whole-genome sequence order able potentially evaluate genetic modifier disease . These material store central repository ( Greenwood Genetics Laboratory ) . The main purpose sample serve durable material future analysis , however , set define analysis perform sample . For sample collect Rett syndrome cohort , investigator perform X-chromosome inactivation study evaluate common polymorphism Brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) determine contribution know factor disease severity . For MECP2 Dup cohort investigator characterize inflammatory marker plasma correlate clinical feature . Also MECP2 Dup cohort investigator perform detailed genomic breakpoint gene content analysis correlate disease severity . Similar analysis genomic breakpoints gene content perform people FOXG1 Duplications . Finally , pilot study , investigator perform metabolic profile people disorder evaluate metabolic feature correlate disease severity , metabolic feature common unique disorder . This work provide durable resource future analysis , extend understand genotype/phenotype correlation , identify biological factor contribute disease severity , well provide framework development biomarkers disease state severity .</detailed_description>
