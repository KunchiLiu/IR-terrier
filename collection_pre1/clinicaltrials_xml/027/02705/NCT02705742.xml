	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation Liver Cirrhosis Due HCV Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator aim transplant autologous , adipose tissue derive mesenchymal stem cell patient liver cirrhosis . Investigators also aim assess liver tissue regeneration , downgrade clinical finding antiviral efficacy . Finally investigator aim establish alternative treatment modality liver transplantation . Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) lead chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) important health problem especially western country . In 5 % - 25 patient chronic HCV hepatitis nonresponders current medical treatment , liver cirrhosis develop . Approximately 1/3 patient liver cirrhosis become decompensate 10 year . Medical treatment liver cirrhosis , last stage illness lead morbidity mortality difficult . Liver transplantation still effective treatment patient liver cirrhosis due chronic hepatitis C , However , serious problem accompany liver transplantation . Lack liver donor , complication surgery , graft rejection high cost main problem . There cell human body capable renew differentiate diverse range specialize cell type . These call `` stem cell '' . Stem cell differentiate specialized cell appropriate medias laboratory . Recently , differentiation potential mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) hepatocytes proved demonstrate hepatocytes contain Y chromosome female bone marrow transplantation male donor . In many laboratory study , observe human adipose tissue derive mesenchymal stem cell , transplant animal induce liver damage , differentiate albumin produce hepatocytes . Even though number study human purpose , finding support animal experiment . Some recent study emphasize antiviral effect MSCs . The reason choose study title ; available medical treatment non-responder cirrhotic patient , shortage organ donor , patient rapidly progress transplantation candidate , patient die wait list finally hopeful data regard MSC application . This hopeful , avant garde sophisticate study may constitute new horizon context cellular therapy . In study autologous adipose tissue derive MSCs transplant patient liver cirrhosis due chronic hepatitis C. After invitro expansion , patient receive 1 million cell per kg . via peripheral vein every week 3 time . Also via hepatic artery , 3 million cell per kg infuse 3 time every 2 week . With protocol , investigator aim increase liver regeneration , decrease liver fibrosis , increase wait time patient transplantation list finally establish new regenerative treatment protocol alternative liver transplantation . For observation clinical laboratory improvement , patient plan monitored pathology examination liver biopsy 6th month treatment , monthly biochemical hematologic blood test periodic radiologic examination .</detailed_description>
