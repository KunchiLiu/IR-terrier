	<brief_summary>This study aim benchmark performance iOS application Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , commonly use assessment tool clinician measure balance across continuum acute care community-based care . An iPhone tie around waist participant concurrent measurement take five fourteen stance comprise BBS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benchmarking iOS Balance Application Against Berg Balance Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>'Project Balance ' aim make balance actionable component individual health , allow long term intervention via monitor train balance health much fall happen . Towards end , design iOS application belt . The phone keep stable low back participant use belt . The application turn accelerometer phone sample acceleration along x ( medium lateral ) z ( anterior posterior ) axis . These displacement mean use calculate Root Mean Square person act proxy score Postural Sway . ( Postural sway define phenomenon constant displacement correction position center gravity within base support ) Studies past compare use accelerometer use clinical measured Timed Up ( TUG ) test Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) assessment postural stability indicate high correlation BBS , TUG Accelerometry . Accelerometry also find able distinguish sway response differ balance condition faller non-fallers . We aim conduct benchmarking study iOS application BBS .</detailed_description>
