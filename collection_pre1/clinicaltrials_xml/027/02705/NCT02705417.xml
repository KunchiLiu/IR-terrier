	<detailed_description>Fistula maturation complex vascular remodelling process require vessel dilation , increase volume flow rate feed artery afferent vein structural alteration vascular wall . The understanding procedure factor involve promote maturation limit . In context , one major area require investigation identification clinically useful pre-operative predictor access outcome . Traditionally , selection vascular access eligibility native arteriovenous fistula construction mainly determine finding clinical examination . However , addition complete history physical examination , National Kidney Foundation/Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative ( NFK/DOQI ) recommend routine pre-operative color Doppler ultrasonographic vascular mapping perform hemodialysis patient candidate access formation . This concern routine implementation non-invasive , safe cost-effective method permit identification vessel suitable arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) construction , acknowledge support Level I evidence still lack . Indeed , available data support significance map access maturation patency rate limit conflicting . The aim present study compare type preoperative assessment , physical examination alone combine CDUS vascular mapping physical examination , outcomes perform vascular access procedure respect type selection long-term patency 12 month hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
