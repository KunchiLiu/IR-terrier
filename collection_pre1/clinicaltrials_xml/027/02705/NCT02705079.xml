	<detailed_description>Endoscopic examination particularly long-lasting intervention uncomfortable patient . Pain vasovagal reaction common . Therefore , implementation generally recommend sedation also carry practice . In interventional longer last intervention ( example , endoscopic ultrasonography , ERCP ) oppose purely diagnostic examination often deep sedation.Use propofol term sedation efficacy wake-up time quality superior use benzodiazepine ( plus opiate ) , patient safety . The vital sign monitor avoid complication dictate current national guideline . Necessary measure monitor include pulse oximetry blood pressure measurement . In patient severe heart disease ECG recording use additionally . Moreover , guideline require sedation clinically monitor continuously avoid unwanted anesthetic stage . Such evaluation , however , often difficult clinical condition even counterproductive , since constant response tactile stimulation patient ( check clinically depth level sedation ) , interrupts endoscopic complex intervention .

In presented study investigator evaluate extent gender difference wake-up time sedation propofol use EEG monitoring . Included patient undergo endoscopic ultrasonography , perform sedation propofol .</detailed_description>
