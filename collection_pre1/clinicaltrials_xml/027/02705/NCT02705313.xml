Any surgery , radioembolization , chemoembolization , chemotherapy radiofrequency ablation within 12 week prior enrollment . Interferons , Everolimus ( mTORinhibitors ) systemic therapy within 4 week prior enrollment . Known brain metastasis , unless metastasis treat stabilized . Uncontrolled congestive heart failure ( NYHA II , III , IV ) . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define fast blood glucose &gt; 2 ULN . Any patient receiving treatment shortacting Octreotide , interrupt 24 h 24 h administration 177LuDOTA0Tyr3Octreotate , patient receive treatment Octreotide LAR , interrupt least 4 week administration 177LuDOTA0Tyr3Octreotate , unless tumor uptake target lesion least high normal liver uptake . Patients significant medical , psychiatric , surgical condition , currently uncontrolled treatment , may pose risk patient safety Prior external beam radiation therapy 25 % bone marrow . Current spontaneous urinary incontinence make impossible safe administration radioactive IMP .
