	<detailed_description>The epidural recognize many year effective analgesia method obstetrical labor . Several different administration protocol evaluate year aim reduce side effect . Epidurals incriminate increase instrumented birth . It indeed possible motor block induce epidural reduces pelvic tonus ability mother push second stage labor . Furthermore , motor block might lead ill rotation foetal head within pelvis , could lead instrumentation ( suction cup , forceps ) . In 2001 , COMET study show use low anesthetic concentration decrease motor bloc allows increase rate vaginal delivery decrease rate instrument birth . In investigator 's institution , ongoing study also provide interim show use low concentration local anesthetic ( oppose high concentration ) tend decrease instrumentation cesarean section rate institution 's population . However , optimal administration mode local anesthetic epidural remain unknown . In last year , grow interest new method administration solution within epidural , programmed intermittent bolus . This method allow good distribution local anesthetic epidural space , compare continuous perfusion . Several study perform show mode administration allow decrease local anesthetic injected dosis give well maternal satisfaction . A meta-analysis performed 2013 also show tendency towards decrease instrument delivery method . Sadly , study date need power prove point certainty . This study therefore focus relationship use epidural program intermittent bolus rate instrument delivery cesarean section . The exact mode administration bolus also subject discussion literature . One question whether preferable administer small bolus frequently large less frequent bolus . A study investigate issue recommend administer large spaced bolus ( 10 mL 60 minute ) .This good match seek physiology ( ie wider distribution epidural space ) provide equivalent analgesia small , frequent bolus .</detailed_description>
