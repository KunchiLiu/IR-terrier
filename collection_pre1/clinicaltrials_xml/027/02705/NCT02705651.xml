	<brief_title>Non-functioning Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors MEN1 : Somatostatin Analogs Versus NO Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction 1.1 Background Due genetic background disease , every single neuroendocrine cell pancreas potential progenitor neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) . More 90 % patient multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( MEN1 ) develop multiple pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNETs ) `` viewable '' transgastric endosonography and/or cross sectional and/or functional imaging . These tumor common cause premature death MEN1 ( 1 , 2 ) . While function pNETs treat reduce cure hormonal excess , strategy address non-functioning ( NF ) pNETs discussion . Treatment range `` watchful waiting '' subtotal total pancreatectomy ( 3-6 ) . The latter may prove `` overtreatment '' result diabetic metabolic status subsequently general long-term complication . Somatostatin analog ( SAs ) show promising result regard progression-free survival patient metastatic NETs midgut ( 9-11 ) . As show recently retrospective study 40 patient early-stage MEN1 duodeno-pancreatic NETs , treatment SAs safe effective , result long-time suppression tumor hormonal activity 10 % objective response . The author suggest start therapy SAs early patient MEN1-related NETs ( 12 ) . Apart clinical study , one case report SAs MEN-1-related insulinoma ( 13 ) . MEN1 orphan disease ( ORPHA652 ) . 2 . Rationale objective In prospective , randomized observation study , benefit subcutaneous application somatostatin analog ( SAs ) every 28 day ( group 1 ) compare treatment ( group 2 ) . It proven beneficial effect SAs show advanced disease also applicable patient early stage ( ≤20mm ) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor MEN1 . `` Watch wait '' without medical treatment standard approach MEN1 patient early stage pancreatic disease . We hypothesize SAs decelerate tumor progression ( accord outcome parameter ) . 3 . Study design 3.1 Design Prospective , randomize , control , observation trial 3.2 Study population Patients prove MEN 1 ( see eligibility criterion ) recruit discuss her/his individual clinical situation interdisciplinary tumor board . The listed examination test carry patient first day study participation : - Medical history physical examination - Height weight - Biochemical parameter ( chromogranin A [ CgA ] level ) 3.3 Description study day The patient evaluate six-monthly interval biochemically radiologically ( accord protocol ) . 3.4 Withdrawal replacement subject Patients withdrawn follow circumstance : - At request - If investigator feel would best interest patient continue . In case , reason study subject withdraw record detail case report form ( CRFs ) subject ' medical record . Should study discontinue prematurely , study material ( complete , partially complete empty CRFs ) retain . 4 Methods evaluation Functional imaging ( DOTA-conjugated peptide PET-CT MRI ) perform venous blood sample draw baseline evaluation general laboratory test Chromogranin A ( CgA ) . 4.1 Imaging modality DOTA-conjugated peptide PET-CT MRI acquire baseline 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month Radiological interim assessment perform MRI 6 , 18 , 30 , 42 54 month . 4.2 Laboratory parameter A venous blood sample drawn assessment ( baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 54 , 60 month ) . CgA determine sample , general laboratory test make yearly ( start baseline ) . 4.3 Adverse event ( AE ) An AE event clinical study , include intercurrent illness accident , impair well-being patient ; may also take form abnormal laboratory value . The term AE imply causal relationship study therapy . All subject experience AEs - whether consider associate study therapy - monitor symptom subside abnormal laboratory value return baseline , satisfactory explanation change observe , death , case full pathologist 's report supply , possible . All finding must report `` AE '' page `` case report form ( CRF ) '' . All AEs divide category `` serious '' `` non-serious '' . This determines procedure must use report/document AE ( see ) . 4.3.1 Definition serious non-serious adverse event A serious AE : - Any event fatal life-threatening - Any event permanently disable - Any event require hospitalization AEs fall category define non-serious . 4.3.2 Reporting /documentation adverse event AEs collect spontaneous reporting . 4.3.3 Assessment severity Regardless classification AE serious non-serious ( see ) , severity must assess mild , moderate severe , accord medical criterion alone : Mild = interfere routine activity , consider acceptable Moderate = interfere routine activity Severe = impossible perform routine activity , consider unacceptable Further category : Requires treatment , require discontinuation study , residual effect . It note severe AE need serious nature serious AE need , definition , severe . Regardless severity , serious AEs must report . 4.4 Data handling procedures A CRF complete patient . Trained personnel check entry error inconsistency clarify immediately . The result pre-study screening examination document study master file . 4.5 Biometric method 4.5.1 Biometric method 1 . Descriptive analysis 2 . After analysis data distribution , parametric non-parametric statistical test apply 4.5.2 Biometric method - adverse events/safety investigation All AEs properly list appropriate method use summarize data . 5 Ethical legal aspect The study perform accordance guideline Declaration Helsinki ( 1964 ) , include current revision . 5.1 Informed consent patient Before admitted clinical investigation , patient must consent participate nature , scope possible consequence clinical study make understandable writing . Patients must give write consent . Their consent confirm signature one investigator . 5.2 Acknowledgment/approval study Before start study , study protocol submit Ethics Committee Medical University Vienna , necessary , responsible Ethics Committees participate center . 5.3 Confidentiality All subject ' name keep secret investigator ' file . Subjects identify throughout documentation evaluation number allot begin study . The subject inform study finding store handled strictest confidence . 6 Documentation use study finding 6.1 Documentation study finding All finding collect study enter CRFs . CRFs complete immediately final examination . 6.2 Use study finding The finding study publish investigator scientific journal present scientific meeting . The manuscript circulate co-investigators submission . 7 Protocol amendment If modification become necessary desirable , documented writing ; major change require approval investigator Ethics Committee .</detailed_description>
