	<brief_title>Analysing Outcomes After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Treatment Carriers Rare Germline Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 900,000 new case prostate cancer ( PCa ) diagnose worldwide every year . PCa rarely diagnose men young 50 year , incidence rise rapidly thereafter . Excluding advanced age , strong risk factor disease family history PCa suggest importance genetic factor disease development . Genome wide association study ( GWAS ) identify 70 susceptibility locus associate modest relative risk PCa , take together , explain 30 % familial PCa risk . Rarer genetic variant confer high PCa risk also identify , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , HOXB13 , Lynch Syndrome gene . Although majority PCa patient may need active surveillance cure radical primary treatment , others eventually succumb advanced disease . In fact , PCa account second commonest cause male cancer-related death United States sixth worldwide , 250,000 death year . Thus , essential identify upfront patient lethal form PCa several study suggest BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation carrier may constitute one population . BRCA mutation Germline BRCA2 mutation genetic event confer high risk PCa know date ( 8.6-fold men â‰¤65 year ) whilst effect BRCA1 modest ( 3.5-fold ) . Germline BRCA2 BRCA1 mutation present 1.2 % 0.44 % sporadic PCa case , respectively . Deleterious germline mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene associate aggressive disease poor clinical outcome . We recently report analysis 2019 PCa patient , 18 61 harbour BRCA1 BRCA2 germline mutation , respectively . This large study date investigate clinical characteristic outcome PCa patient without BRCA mutation . Our result reveal wide spectrum pathogenic mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene confers aggressive PCa phenotype tumour frequently associate lymph node involvement distant metastasis diagnosis PCa non-carriers . BRCA1 BRCA2 carrier higher incidence poorly differentiate tumour , present large tumour higher incidence node involvement distant metastasis . We also demonstrate BRCA2 germline mutation PCa , prognostic factor poor overall survival , cause specific survival metastasis free survival , independently classical prognostic factor , include stage , Gleason score , PSA . In series observe although BRCA1 carrier present similar baseline risk characteristic BRCA2 carrier , survival parameter similar non-carriers . BRCA2 BRCA1 status , confirm independent prognostic factor PCa outcome . Nevertheless , study others include small number BRCA1 carrier due relatively low incidence PCa carrier mutation conclusion regard group patient take cautiously . The study mention suggest PCa associated germline BRCA mutation may respond differently conventional treatment currently available PCa . In general population , multidisciplinary approach use treatment option include active surveillance , surgery , radiotherapy ( external beam brachytherapy ) , androgen deprivation therapy chemotherapy . No study date investigate whether optimal treatment strategy specifically BRCA mutation carrier . Therefore , large study analyze outcomes BRCA carrier treatment radical surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy urgently need would enable tailored management patient . The implementation early diagnosis patient may also crucial currently IMPACT study evaluate utility PSA-based PCa screen asymptomatic BRCA carrier . Lynch Syndrome Another group high PCa risk report Lynch syndrome patient . Lynch syndrome multi-cancer syndrome cause germline mutation MMR gene ; MLH1 , MSH2 MSH6 . Colorectal cancer predominant cancer phenotype patient syndrome 70 % probability develop disease age 70 . In addition , increase risk extracolonic tumour , include endometrium , stomach , small bowel , ovary , ureter , renal pelvis , biliary tract brain pancreas . PCa report family , recently show feature Lynch syndrome . At moment , little know association germline mutation gene PCa phenotype outcome . Prostate cancer describe component tumour Lynch syndrome . The estimated cumulative lifetime risk two-fold high general population . The cumulative risk prostate cancer age 60 6.3 % age 80 30 % . HOXB13 Recently , rare , recurrent mutation ( G84E ) HOXB13 , 17q21-12 region report associated prostate cancer risk . The homeobox transcription factor gene important prostate development . The HOXB13 G84E mutation find 5 % PCa family , mainly Northern Europe . Another group undertake systematic literature review Germline Homeobox B13 G84E mutation study European Descendants . A meta-analysis 24213 case PCa 73631 control conduct confirm HOXB13 G84E mutation associate increased prostate cancer risk Odds ratio 4.07 ( 95 % CI:3.05-5.45 ) . A subgroup analysis base ethnic origin reveal Odds ratio high Western Europeans ( OR=8.66 ) low Northern Europeans ( OR=3.63 ) . The G84E mutation associate early onset PCa Odds Ratio 10.11 early onset PCa 3.63 late onset PCa . When assess aggressiveness disease , G84E mutation appear predict aggressive presentation . While study need define clinical utility observation , suggest variant may also associate feature undifferentiated tumour therefore may associate aggressive disease . 1 . Rationale GENPROS aim observe outcome patient rare germline genetic variant include BRCA1 , BRCA2 , HOXB13 , MMR gene mutation carrier follow prostate cancer ( PCa ) diagnosis treatment . The primary endpoint relative Cause Specific Survival ( CSS ) men PCa germline mutation prostate cancer predisposition gene . This critical importance support clinical trial investigate appropriate management PCa group high risk patient . The study include cohort rare gene mutation carrier PCa control group form PCa patient know carry mutation gene comparison . In first instance , carrier mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene recruit gene variant test clinical research setting , expand protocol examine association also . Clinical data regard diagnosis , treatment , recurrence outcome PCa collect retrospectively prospectively contact participant 's treating team . All men study followed-up least five year enrolment study . A sample participant 's PCa also request molecular profiling , well family history cancer . We also collect sample DNA investigation common allele profile specific common allele association prognosis outcomes . The study undertaken number international site , subject IRB approval .</detailed_description>
