	<detailed_description>Scientific Background Degenerative lung disorder result inflammatory event end destruction normal pulmonary architecture . Two main pattern exist : 1 . Chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) major cause morbidity mortality . Until 2020 expect become third cause mortality follow cardiovascular disorder cancer . Emphysema destructive form COPD alveolated tissue disappears . This anatomic pattern always homogenous functional impairment connect extent tissue destruction . Therapeutic elimination destroy tissue may achieve surgery use various block technique ( Lung Volume Reduction ) . 2 . Pulmonary fibrosis ( PF ) characterize abnormal repair respiratory epithelium . Various disease may result PF infection , autoimmune ( connective tissue disorder ) , sarcoidosis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis , pneumoconiosis , histiocytosis X , lymphangioleiomyomatosis LAM etc . In many situation cause effect relationship identify disease idiopathic IPF . During last year cell base therapy use progenitor cell various scaffold become available various medical field . Lung regenerative medicine appear alternative transplantation end-stage disease . However , complex cellular composition lung , comprise 40 different cell type , make objective challenging . The epithelial lining respiratory tract , compose conduct respiratory part , varies along proximo-distal axis . The conducting airways trachea bronchiole human lung consist pseudostratified epithelium , comprise equal proportion basal cell , secretory cell , ciliated cell , well neuroendocrine cell . The small bronchiole , know terminal respiratory bronchiole , line simple columnar cuboidal epithelium contain secretory ciliated cell few basal cell . The epithelium conduct airway form tight barrier outside world specialize process mucociliary clearance . The alveolus line type 1 2 alveolar epithelial cell , call AT1 AT2 , respectively , hereafter . These cell also specialize barrier function extremely thin AEC1s share basement membrane surround network pulmonary capillary facilitate diffusion gas atmosphere circulation . This general distribution epithelial cell type conserve human model organisms rodent . However , notable difference . For example , transition pseudostratified columnar epithelium occur proximally rodent , trachea mainstem bronchus line pseudostratified epithelium . Nearly intralobar airway mice line simple columnar cuboidal epithelium basal cell . In mouse , abrupt transition conduct airway alveoli know broncho-alveolar duct junction . In human , terminal bronchiole give rise respiratory bronchiole many alveolar duct terminate ultimately alveoli . Considering essential role epithelial compartment lung much effort do identify epithelial stem progenitor cell responsible regenerative reparative function . Epithelial progenitor reside unique microenvironment niche , represent vascular mesenchymal cell , richly innervate . This architecture highly resemble HSM niche . Considerable progress make mouse toward identify signal regulate lung epithelial stem cell self-renewal differentiation . These include Notch , Hippo/Yap , ROS/Nrf2 , EGF , FGF , c-myb , cytokine include IL-4 , -13 -6 . Neighboring epithelial cell , stromal cell ( include mesenchymal cell , fibroblast , smooth muscle cell , endothelium ) immune cell represent potential source factor . Distinct stem cell niche define adult mouse trachea lung steady state increase evidence different pathological condition stem cell niche affect altered . Very little known stem cell stem cell niche human adult lung signal regulate maintenance lung tissue homeostasis health disease . Recently , Reisner group Weizmann Institute demonstrate vacate lung stem cell niches pre-requisite successful transplantation mouse human lung progenitor ( Nature Medicine 2015 ) . To end , use initial lung injury naphthalene trigger immediate stimulation endogenous progenitor . Thus within 48 hour divide progenitor could effectively ablate 6 Gy total body irradiation enable effective engraftment donor lung progenitor ( Fig.1 ) . Fig . 1 : Engraftment functional repair injured lung mouse embryonic lung cell . Following lung injury NA condition 6Gy TBI , C57BL/6 adult mouse transplant syngeneic E16 stage embryonic lung cell GFP+ donor . ( , b ) Representative two-photon microscopy extend focus image lung transplant mice 6 week transplantation , show entire scan depth top bottom chimeric lung , without ( : z-stack 88μm ) , ( b ) co-staining blood vessel Quantum dot ( red ) ( bar=90μm ) . ( c ) Two-photon extended focus image , show entire scan depth top bottom chimeric lung ( z-stack 96μm ) 16 week post-transplantation . ( ) Two-photon microscopy non-transplanted C57BL mouse lung show background ( bar=90μm ) . ( e , f , g ) Representative image chimeric lung stain anti-GFP ( green ) anti-AQP-5 ( red ) , indicate incorporation donor-derived type I alveocytes gas-exchange surface . ( h , , j ) Chimeric lung stain anti-GFP ( green ) , anti-Sp-C antibody ( blue ) , demonstrate donor-derived surfactant produce type II alveocytes ( bars=20μm ) . All individual image show representative n=10 mouse pool 3 independent experiment . ( , n ) Lung function measurement 6 week transplantation . ( k , l ) Staining chimeric lung CFTR ( red ) ( GFP ) , demonstrate CFTR positive donor cell . ( ) Lung baseline compliance . Comparison control intact mouse v mouse lung injury ( Student 's t-test , P &lt; 0.001 ) , mice lung injury v mouse transplant injury ( Student 's t-test , P=0.008 ) . ( n ) Tissue damp . Comparison control mouse v mouse lung injury ( Student 's t-test , P=0.015 ) , mice lung injury v mouse transplant injury ( Student 's t-test , P=0.021 ) . Values mean ± SEM 10-15 ( n=15 control , n=10 injured n=10 treat ) mouse group pool two independent experiment However , condition require enable effective engraftment donor lung progenitor normal mouse , envision patient different lung disease , lung niche could already partially deplete therefore transplantation might require less severe conditioning . Objective To characterize stem cell compartment niche different clinical situation ( non-diseased compare emphysematous fibrotic pulmonary tissue ) ass proliferative developmental property vitro . To implement lung organoid culture system drug screen development patient personalize medicine . Methods Biopsies lung tissue obtain surgical procedure : open lung biopsy . This procedure routinely perform histological diagnosis fibrotic disease . Patients emphysema end stage fibrotic disease high risk develop lung cancer . A large proportion surgically treat lung cancer patient emphysema fibrotic disease histologic background . Lobectomy pneumonectomy frequently perform state art procedure lung cancer surgical management . Part resect lung tissue contain emphysematous fibrotic change make look macroscopically microscopically normal . These `` non-cancerous '' area sample preserve Sheba Tissue Bank evaluation together sample fibrotic emphysematous area . The biopsy analyze immunohistology , FACS 3D organoids ( removal fibroblast ) immunology laboratory Weizmann Institute . All Samples collect follow informed consent signatures patient designate informed consent form protocol tissue bank form . We may many 3-4 patients/ week . Collected sample resect experienced personnel either Thoracic Surgery Department Pathology Department ( part job description Tissue Bank ) . Fresh sample transport Weizmann institute FACS IHC . As limited knowledge exist human lung tissue mandatory test lung tissue healthy diseased lung . Initially suggest test 10-15 normal lung tissue 15-20 diseased sample period 2 year . As mention normal lung tissue obtain `` non-cancerous '' area patient undergo lobectomies/pneumonectomies .</detailed_description>
