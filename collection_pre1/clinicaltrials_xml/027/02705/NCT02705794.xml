	<brief_summary>The study title `` Clinical trial comparative evaluation Modified Mallampati Score Modified Mallampati Score along Thyromental distance , Anatomical abnormality , Cervical mobility ( M-TAC ) Predicting Difficult Airway `` undertaken evaluate prediction difficult airway compare preoperative airway evaluation test . Mallampati classification use screen test detection difficult intubation classification oropharyngeal view . Other test include sternomental distance , thyromental distance , Wilson risk sum score , upper lip bite test , protrusion mandible , tooth morphology , head extension , mouth opening , body mass index , 3-3-2 rule ultrasonography neck soft tissue . We study 200 adult ASA I &amp; II patient either sex , age 18-60 yr undergo elective surgery receive general anesthesia . Modified mallampati classification four grade &amp; grade give score , similarly thyromental distance ( TMD ) , anatomical abnormality ( AA ) &amp; cervical mobility ( CM ) classify three grade &amp; grade give score . For M-TAC individual score add .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The term 'airway ' refers upper airway may define extra-pulmonary air passage , consist nasal oral cavity , pharynx , larynx , trachea large bronchus . The commonly apply method oxygenation ventilation tracheal tube , laryngeal mask , face mask . Problems tracheal intubation remain major cause death disability due anaesthesia analyse record United Kingdom medical defence society American Society Anaesthesiologists close claim database . 'Difficult airway ' one problem establish maintain gas exchange via mask , artificial airway . Prediction difficult airway management remain pivotal challenge anaesthesiologists accurate prediction get alter potentially dangerous unanticipated airway anticipate difficult airway , predominantly , ample time proper preparation . This helpful reduce potential complication allocation experience personnel use relevant equipment well plan strategy . However rare , spite , occurrence difficult airway management still occur prompts increase risk morbidity mortality - especially anticipate . Unanticipated difficulty intubation patient elective surgical procedure occur 1.5 13 percent case none mention abnormality result morbidity mortality . Several pre-operative risk factor assess airway difficulty identify , yet none convince diagnostic accuracy use isolation . Combining several risk factor increase predictive value test multivariable risk model develop . As anatomy head neck region play lead role decide fateful profile airway , especially associate influential abnormality . So , simple bedside test , modify Mallampati test , find limit value rely use predict difficult laryngoscopy . Exclusively individual investigated isolation use single score test , long realize difficult laryngoscopy multifactorial problem . Thus , effective prediction require combination multiple test provide high index sensitivity specificity prediction difficult airway . Thus , venture combine Mallampati score anatomical factor ( thyromental distance , anatomical abnormality cervical mobility ) develop new simpler clinical prediction model well predictive ability .</detailed_description>
