	<brief_summary>Naloxegol recently approve US Food Drug Administration treat opioid induced constipation non-cancer chronic pain patient . Its effectiveness acute care patient , however , know . Therefore , researcher ' goal investigate whether naloxegol superior osmotic laxative refractory constipation ICU patient already receive prophylactic stool softener simulant laxatives double-blind , randomize control trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Naloxegol Refractory Constipation Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constipation often define absence bowel movement 3 consecutive day . The incidence constipation critically ill patient estimate 50-80 % . Constipation ICU associate various undesirable clinical outcome , include : increase rate infection , prolonged duration mechanical ventilation , great hospital length stay , worsen organ dysfunction , even high mortality . Typical first-line agent management ICU constipation include stool softener ( e.g . docusate ) bowel stimulant ( e.g . senna glycol bisacodyl ) , often use prophylactically critically ill patient . However , significant proportion patient require additional therapy promote laxation , common osmotic agent propylene glycol lactulose . Often , multiple dos osmotic agent several day require achieve acceptable laxation rate critical illness . As , prompt need target therapy improve constipation ICU . Among major risk factor constipation ICU lack bowel stimulation via nutrition exposure high dos continuous opioids . Indeed , clinical data suggest early enteral nutrition promote laxation ICU patient . And recently , methylnaltrexone , peripherally act μ-opioid receptor antagonist , show promising result ability reverse opioid-induced constipation . However , methylnaltrexone deliver via subcutaneous injection absorption likely variable critically ill patient often receive aggressive fluid resuscitation significant peripheral edema . The US Food Drug Administration recently approve use naloxegol , μ-opioid receptor antagonist available tablet form , management opioid-induced constipation non-cancer chronic pain patient .</detailed_description>
