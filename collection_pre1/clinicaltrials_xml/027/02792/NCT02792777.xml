	<brief_title>Concept Mapping Scalable Method Identifying Patient-Important Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study compare two method - concept map one-on-one interview . The investigator test method compare comprehensiveness list patient-important outcome obtain method ( primary outcome ) well efficiency , measure resource intensiveness , method ( secondary outcome ) . The aim study test adult patient moderately poorly control diabetes mellitus receive care large , urban , academic health system . In order allow comparison comprehensiveness method produce patient-important outcome regardless healthcare set outcome elicit , investigator recruit patient interview group 3 different care setting : acute care visit ( emergency department ) , post-acute care visit ( within 1 week hospital discharge ) , routine primary care visit . Target sample size within healthcare set 30 patient , anticipated number need thematic saturation . The investigator recruit patient-participants exist clinical research databases 3 separate concept mapping group , target 20 patient . In Aim 2 , investigator test hypothesis concept map research set produce outcomes consistent elicit patient `` real-world '' setting . In Aim 3 , investigator assess overall resource utilization , assess primarily time required patient , research team , advisory board , qualitative interview conduct thematic saturation within single healthcare set compare resource use single iteration concept mapping . Findings work improve patient-centered outcome research method provide researcher information standardize scalable method identify patient-important outcome use research study , individual patient able select outcome useful . In addition provide insight regard method elicit patient-centered outcome , study also provide valuable information stakeholder regard patient ' priority vary across care continuum . The investigator report finding concept map apply across healthcare setting , degree patient priority ( base interview ) differ across healthcare setting . If concept mapping result ( collected research set ) capture priority identify patient across different healthcare setting , find would enhance researcher ' ability perform study different , multiple , setting . If finding generalize across setting , valuable find demonstrate patient priority differ across interview setting patient acuity validate researcher ' need specific set choose perform research ensure reach intended patient population . The work perform close collaboration Patient Key Stakeholder Advisory Board ( PAKSAB ) - equal partner research team involve proposal inception . PAKSAB member part research team throughout conduct aim assist analysis data interpretation .</detailed_description>
