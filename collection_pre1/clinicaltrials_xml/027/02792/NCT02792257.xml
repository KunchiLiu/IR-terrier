	<brief_title>Trial Dronabinol Adjunctive Treatment Agitation Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) ( THC-AD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) prevalent neurodegenerative disease age , affect estimate 5.2 million Americans predict increase 13.8 million 2050 . AD affect cognition emotion . Neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPS ) AD major cause burden patient , caregiver , society near-universal point AD course &gt; 97 % AD patient least one symptom report Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) . One troubling symptom agitation ( Agit-AD ) , typify variety problem behavior include combativeness , yelling , pacing , lack cooperation care , insomnia , restlessness . In community-based sample , Agit-AD common . Agit-AD associate great caregiver burden shorter time institutionalization , particularly acute need intervention severe Agit-AD advance dementia . While currently FDA approve medication Agit-AD , psychotropic medication widely prescribe `` off-label '' treat Agit-AD . The commonly used class medication prescribe `` off-label '' treatment antipsychotic antidepressant . The evidence date efficacy remain mixed . Antipsychotics appear degree efficacy , effect highly replicable use associate increased mortality elderly patient dementia . Antidepressants ( particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , ( SSRI ) ) appear few less severe adverse effect compare antipsychotic , well know mortality risk , without limitation . Therefore , exploration alternative treatment Agit-AD , particularly severe case , timely warrant . Dronabinol ( Marinol® ) FDA-approved treatment anorexia/weight loss AIDS nausea/emesis associate chemotherapy , use off-label Agit-AD . Dronabinol synthetic oral formulation delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , psychoactive constituent cannabis plant act partial agonist Type 1 ( CB1 ) Type 2 ( CB2 ) endocannabinoid receptor . This pharmacology appropriate target Agit-AD CB1 receptor agonism produce anxiolytic antidepressant effect CB2 receptor agonism anti-inflammatory . The mechanism dronabinol exert effect agitation aggression patient dementia may occur action CB1 and/or CB2 receptor . Agonists CB1 receptor brain improve anxiety depression human well animal model . Dronabinol effective agonist CB1 receptor , generally specific neuron localize predominantly presynaptic terminal inhibits glutamatergic , dopaminergic neurotransmitter release . The CB1 receptor effect observe mediate observe anxiolytic antidepressant effect THC . Dronabinol also agonist CB2 , potent anti-inflammatory receptor localize activated microglia . Patients AD increased central peripheral inflammation , likely result accumulation beta-amyloid . Increased inflammation may number behavioral effect could drive agitation aggression dementia patient . Dronabinol 's effect CB2 receptor therefore could also produce change behavior AD patient reduce inflammation .</detailed_description>
