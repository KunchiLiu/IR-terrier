	<brief_summary>The management symptomatic patient moderate Aortic Stenosis ( AS ) remain challenging test would give definitive answer need . The value increase Aortic Valve mean Gradient ( AVMG ) , lack change Aortic Valve area ( AVA ) calculation valve compliance/resistance stress echo ( SE ) symptomatic moderate AS population prognostication investigator knowledge examine . Similarly additive value myocardial blood flow reserve ( MBFR ) , Computed Tomography ( CT ) calcium score , speckle track echocardiography , carotid ultrasonography , N-Terminal pro B- type natriuretic peptide B ( NT-proBNP ) prognostication population group especially combination SE remain unclear .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence aortic valve stenosis ( AS ) increase last decade due improvement life expectancy grow elderly population . A wealth data available patient severe AS , whereas risk stratification management patient symptomatic moderate AS remains contentious . Stress echocardiography ( SE ) recognise tool risk stratification patient asymptomatic severe AS . Exercise preferred mode stress group , provide important prognostic information- presence symptom , overall exercise capacity precipitation hypotension . Significant increase mean gradient ( MG ) ( MG &gt; 20mmHg ) independent predictor valve intervention cardiovascular death , similar old age , diabetes high rest gradient recognise international guideline parameter risk stratify asymptomatic severe AS . The increase MG context increase transvalvular flow exercise usually accompany little change aortic valve area ( AVA ) . Thus , mechanistically , increase MG associated bad outcome reflect intrinsic non-compliance aortic valve hence resistance . A compliant valve open accommodate increase flow stress , whereas fix valve orifice , result increased gradient . It therefore advise patient asymptomatic severe AS significant increase MG exercise may reasonably consider aortic valve intervention . In moderate AS current guideline recommend Aortic Valve replacement ( AVR ) cardiac surgery ( coronary artery bypass graft ) plan ( class IIa ) . This patient moderate AS heterogeneous group regard risk adverse event : indeed rapid progression severe AS , and/or Left Ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction cardiovascular death , whereas others remain stable many year . Overall moderate AS carry substantial risk death valve intervention , estimate likelihood event free survival 4 year 55-60 % . Furthermore presence symptom increase overall likelihood risk moderate AS , significant difference outcome minimally symptomatic symptomatic moderate AS . It maybe hypothesise patient moderate AS symptom absence myocardial ischaemia due flow-limiting coronary artery disease likely valve hemodynamics one severe AS , particularly decrease valve compliance/increased resistance . These characteristic likely manifest exercise transvalvular flow increase result significant increase gradient little change AVA . Accordingly , rest AVA MG may best parameter determine suitability valve intervention , particularly overall mortality symptomatic moderate aortic stenosis approach symptomatic severe AS . However , clear criterion risk-stratify patient symptomatic moderate AS guide time intervention currently exist . Accordingly role SE could expand beyond assessment risk asymptomatic severe AS improve risk stratification patient symptomatic moderate AS . This assumption moderate AS associate symptom breathlessness , chest pain syncope likely characteristic severe AS . This mean SE moderate symptomatic AS one would expect AVA remain unchanged , valve resistance elevate MG increase . Furthermore SE apart valve related index determine severity ( AVA , MG ) , myocardial blood flow reserve ( MBFR ) show correlate severity AS ; reduce MBFR see severe AS whereas MBFR &lt; 1.8 accuracy 85 % distinguish severe non-severe AS . It could therefore MBFR also contribute risk stratification symptomatic moderate AS . It suggest several test could contribute risk stratification AS i.e . CT calcium score , speckle track echocardiography , carotid ultrasonography , N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) . Specifically show aortic valve calcium score correlate AS severity moderate agreement AVA define American College Cardiology ( ACC ) guideline degree AS determine AV calcium score . Basal global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) find independently associate severity AS presence symptom . Furthermore GLS predict all-cause mortality patient AS could therefore improve identification optimal time AV replacement . The severity AS general also show correspond increase carotid plaque intima medium thickness ( IMT ) . Finally NT-proBNP value correlate severity AS moderate AS , NT-proBNP differentiate symptomatic asymptomatic status .</detailed_description>
