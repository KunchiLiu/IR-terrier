	<detailed_description>Since 1970s , connection amyloidosis carpal tunnel syndrome describe , tenosynovial tissue stain positive amyloid fibril deposition . Up 30 % patient prior study idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome biopsy tissue stain positive amyloid deposition . However , prevalence cardiac involvement time carpal tunnel syndrome surgery establish . Furthermore , role TTR kinetic stability disease progression amyloidosis unclear . Diagnosing TTR amyloidosis time carpal tunnel involvement could lead early identification disease stage cardiomyopathy may occult less advanced . In addition , abnormal TTR kinetics may even precede tissue deposition flexor tendon retinaculum . As several emerge pharmacological strategy development may slow even halt TTR amyloidosis , early diagnosis advantageous . Identification implementation therapy prevention early disease treatment may alter natural history progressive systemic disease .</detailed_description>
