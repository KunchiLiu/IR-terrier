Despite show excellent result 5 year acceptable postoperative morbidity , literature SADI-S originates single center compare directly BPD-DS . Hence , investigator aim evaluate feasibility , safety , postoperative outcome SADI-S compare conventional BPD-DS morbidly obese patient . Our project three specific aim : 1 . To evaluate feasibility short-term safety SADI-S . The investigator assess operative parameter ( e.g . procedure time , inadvertent injury , need conversion laparotomy , transfusion blood product ) 30-day postoperative adverse event ( e.g . length stay , superficial/deep surgical site infection , leak , venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , need reintervention readmission ) . 2 . To evaluate short long-term beneficial outcome . The investigator evaluate compare excess weight loss , resolution type-2 diabetes comorbidities , change quality life 1 , 6 , 12 month yearly thereafter group . 3 . To evaluate compare long-term morbidity . The investigator evaluate compare group 6 , 12 month yearly thereafter follow surgery long-term morbidity ( e.g . frequency bowel movement , fat malabsorption , micronutrient protein-calorie malnutrition , need supplemental nutrition , internal/incisional hernia , gastro-esophageal reflux ) .</detailed_description>
