	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficiency dietary intervention intradialytic weight gain . Uniric hemodialysis patient without serious dietary complication , accumulate 2.5 kg ( 4 % ) dry weight , undergo series dietary consultation sodium restriction . One month intervention , intradialytic weight accumulation measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daily Sodium Intake Anuric Hemodialysis Patients Interdialytic Weight Gain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inter Dialytic Weight Gain ( IDWG ) ascribe fluid retention one major clinical problem patient hemodialysis need cope 2 subsequent hemodialysis especially patient residual renal function . Fluid retention associate morbid condition lower-extremity edema , ascites , pulmonary vascular congestion edema , hypertension , worsen heart failure . Gain weight 2 kg 2 subsequent hemodialysis find high risk all-cause mortality cardiovascular death .Lowering daily sodium intake find mitigate fluid retention , however research check . 2IDWG also associate poor quality life . Dietary sodium restriction recommendation since begin hemodialysis base association restriction balance hypertension fluid retention . Sodium intake recommend patient hemodialysis limit 2 gram day . Nevertheless , study examine efficiency restriction complexity measurement sodium intake . One recently publish study use 24-h recall measure sodium intake , find direct correlation IDGW mortality form reason . In spite complexity , IDWG find direct relation patient ' nutrition status . One sodium-related issue malnutrition . Malnutrition dialysis risk factor patient ' morbidity mortality . Higher sodium intake associate high calorie protein intake , adherence restriction sodium intake poor hemodialysis . This reason high importance study effect sodium restriction people 2.5 kg ( 4 % dry body weight ) IDWG follow nutritional status</detailed_description>
