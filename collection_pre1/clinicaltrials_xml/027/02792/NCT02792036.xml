	<brief_summary>Retinoblastoma ( RB ) common intraocular tumor childhood . Recurrent refractory disease follow therapy often occur due persistence vitreous disease and/or retinal reactivation main tumor mass . With treatment protocol , investigator seek identify less invasive method local drug delivery disrupt eye 's integrity . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To determine safety toxicity profile associate intravitreal carboplatin treatment recurrent progressive intraocular retinoblastoma vitreous seeding . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To estimate ocular salvage rate treatment intravitreal carboplatin patient recurrent progressive intraocular retinoblastoma vitreous seeding . - To evaluate effect intravitreal carboplatin therapy histopathology eye enucleate progressive recalcitrant disease therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Carboplatin Treatment Participants With Recurrent Refractory Intraocular Retinoblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The eye ( ) sterilize prior injection . Aqueous fluid ( 0.1-0.15ml ) withdrawn send pathology review . Carboplatin dilute normal saline administer via intravitreal injection anesthesia eligible eye approximately every 14 day . Following injection , triple freeze/thaw cryotherapy apply injection site eye wash water . The eye gently `` shaken '' direction evenly distribute drug . This trial use traditional phase I design dose de-escalation two dose level . The first 6 patient enrol dose level 1 observe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) throughout treatment period approximately 5 month start therapy . If 0-2 ( first 6 ) participant experience DLT , second cohort 6 patient enrol dose level 1 . Study accrual would complete 12 . However , 3 first 6 patient experience DLT dose level 1 , dose level would de-escalated level -1 6 patient enrol level ( dose -1 ) . If 0-2 patient experience DLT dose level -1 , second cohort 6 patient enrol dose level -1 , study accrual would complete . If 3 patient experience DLT dose level -1 , accrual would also complete .</detailed_description>
