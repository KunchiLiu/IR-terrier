	<brief_summary>As people grow old skeletal muscle gradually become small weaker , cause reduce mobility quality life . To understand reverse negative process investigator need find new way improve ability muscle perform physical activity . There evidence supplement may improve mitochondrion work , investigator want explore idea detail , measure muscle work respond exercise take supplement . This give u basic information investigator would need see useful idea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increasing Mitochondrial Function Skeletal Muscle Performance Older Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A defining feature age loss muscle mass ( 'sarcopenia ' ) associate functional weakness ( 'dynapenia ' ) . A common characteristic dynapenia lower mitochondrial content metabolic function , cause reduce aerobic capacity , increase sensation effort impair lipid oxidation ( resultant glucose intolerance ) . Exercise training improve mitochondrial muscle function age population , however adaptation remain young counterpart , suggest alternative approach require . Pre-clinical study show dietary supplementation precursor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) restore mitochondrial biogenesis oxidative capacity age rodent diabetic human . However , whether NAD+ precursor rejuvenate mitochondrial capacity , ultimately , muscle function old human unknown . This pilot project therefore investigate efficacy NAD+ precursor supplementation increase muscle performance normally active old men , combine examination molecular metabolic mechanism regulate physiological response .</detailed_description>
