	<brief_summary>Compressive stocking ameliorate functional outcome quality life patient elective orthopedic foot ankle surgery . In randomized controlled trial investigator want analyze effect compressive stocking foot ankle surgery . Additionally investigator want evaluate compliance compressive stocking Treatment . Therefore electronic chip device implant compressive stocking monitor wear time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensor Controlled Compliance Evaluation Compressive Elastic Stockings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain swell typical sequela follow surgical procedure foot ankle . While know compressive stocking treatment decrease swell improves overall ankle function quality life patient ankle fracture , investigator hypothesize compressive stocking could also ameliorate functional outcome quality life patient elective orthopedic foot ankle surgery . Reduced compliance wear compressive stocking foot ankle surgery might probably limit factor postoperative adjuvant compressive therapy . Therefore investigator want evaluate patientÂ´s compliance use electronic chip device monitor wear behavior . All patient operate foot ankle randomize blindly assign either compressive control-group . Each group consist 80 patient ( 160 patient total ) . The compression group include patient receive postoperative compression stocking . The control group receive stocking . Regular check 6 week 12 week postoperatively perform order ass follow parameter : 1 . Foot Ankle Scores 2 . Pain 2 . Swelling foot low limb 3 . Wearing compliance electronically record wearing time . The Information implant sensor , record stocking wear time give patient compressive stocking therapy ( 6 week ) , patient influence fact , wear behaviour measure . After information , patient decide sensor information may evaluate study team .</detailed_description>
