	<brief_summary>Brain Tumour ( BT ) survivor struggle disable physical , emotional , cognitive psychosocial sequela . Unfortunately , to-date limited research rehabilitative intervention population . With 55,000 BT survivor Canada alone , access effective , evidence-based rehabilitative treatment would improve BT survivor ' quality life ( QOL ) capacity cope necessity . Mindfulness-Based Interventions ( MBIs ) emerge potential treatment address need . MBIs group-based psychological treatment cop illness disability , goal improve psychological wellbeing . Recent study begin suggest role MBIs address symptom burden QOL acquire brain injury ( ABI ) population , heterogeneous population include survivor stroke traumatic brain injury , well BT survivor . High quality research , include rigorous randomize controlled trial , need demonstrate whether MBIs provide efficacious , accessible cost-effective treatment improve life BT survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increased survival rate life expectancy primary BT survivor today result need expand focus acute treatment reduce disability long-term symptom burden survivorship . Many BT survivor leave reduced autonomy life , low likelihood independent living increase risk functional symptom adversity ( pain physical disability ) , unemployment , family difficulty . Unsurprisingly , factor associate increased stress , psychological suffering , reduce QOL . Research note prevalence psychological distress cognitive impairment , experience late effect , 90 % survivor experience form cognitive impairment depressive symptom , well many 80 % experience mental fatigue 60 % experience anxiety . 80 % central nervous system tumour survivor exhibit rehabilitation need , survivor report interest learn cop technique stress , yet majority symptom remain underestimated untreated . BT survivor leave limited treatment option promote long-term wellbeing , 71 % resource contain minimal information cop outcome . Despite considerable research demonstrate BT survivor increase risk symptom burden reduce QOL , little research treatment effective intervention . Some outpatient rehabilitation therapy make available neurologically impaired population ( e.g . Traumatic Brain Injury , Stroke ) evidence support specific approach equivocal , limited rehabilitative research BT survivor specifically . Such treatment broader ABI population to-date include Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) Applied Behavioural Analysis ( ABA ) , debatable effectiveness . Positive study suggest treatment may prove effective handful ABI sequela . Studies date mar limited methodological rigour applicability BT population broader , heterogeneous ABI focus . As result , healthcare professional national organization , National Coalition Cancer Survivorship , call high quality research inform novel treatment improve outcome specific group , BT population . In response call , Mindfulness-Based Interventions ( MBIs ) propose plausible treatment long term care ABI survivor , general . MBIs use non-stigmatizing approach , combine secularized eastern meditative practice western psychological advance . MBIs good evidence improve wide range sequela , include , stress , depression , anxiety cognitive impairment . MBI efficacy repeatedly demonstrate across multiple psychiatric , neurological , cancer population . MBIs focus acceptance-based adaptive approach , might theoretically well suit reality live BT survivor , would change-based approach CBT ABA . MBI participant learn generate less distress , engage positively life , respond difficult situation adaptively ; often describe transformative . MBIs begin study broad ABI survivor population , emerge literature suggest efficacy reduce symptom burden . However , know study consider effectiveness MBI BT survivor specifically ; present study aim fill important knowledge gap . The goal study test effectiveness MBI course reduce depressive symptom perceive stress , well improve overall QOL wellbeing low-grade BT survivor .</detailed_description>
