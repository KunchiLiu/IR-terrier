	<brief_summary>This phase 1 study investigational agent CFI-402257 patient advanced cancer . The purpose study see safe tolerable CFI-402257 cancer patient well pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . This study first time CFI-402257 give human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigational Drug CFI-402257 Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CFI-402257 oral drug block TTK protein kinase ( also know Monopolar spindle 1 [ Mps1 ] ) activity . TTK protein important regulating cell growth , cell death , ensure proper division . Many tumor show make much TTK . When much TTK produce , believe contribute uncontrolled cancer cell growth division lead additional mutation cancer cell . Therefore , believe block protein work lead cancer cell death , stop tumor grow shrink . This study two part : dose escalation dose expansion . The dose escalation part test different dose level study drug group patient find high dose study drug give safely patient ( call maximum tolerate dose MTD ) . The expansion part ass safety , tolerability , PK MTD find escalation part study additional group patient .</detailed_description>
