It also determine , limited efficacy , effectiveness multisensory stimulation intervention protocol reduce duration post-traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) , improve cognition , increase independence activity daily live long term quality life affect person . Participants randomise either experimental control group . The experimental group follow multisensory stimulation intervention protocol , control group follow current hospital protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multisensory Stimulation Enriched Environments During Post-traumatic Amnesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : A phase II randomise control trial . Repeated measure behaviour sensory motor performance take PTA progression participant . The RCT involve two treatment arm blind assessment post-intervention point PTA resolution , one month follow PTA resolution , 6-month post-injury follow questionnaire . The 2 treatment group : 1 . Experimental intervention protocol : occupation-based multisensory stimulation use enrich environment ; 2 . Control intervention protocol : standard therapy provide hospital include re-orientation participation basic functional task . Participants : Approximately twenty participant recruit Institut Guttmann , neuro-rehabilitation hospital Badalona , Spain . Measures : The evaluation tool consist standardise , establish assessment use brain injury rehabilitation detail Outcome Measures section . Procedure : Repeated measurement behaviour sensory motor function correspond participant 's progression PTA assessment score take . The maximum number time single participant test PTA 7 time twice follow emergence PTA , within first 3 day 1 week . All measurement non-invasive provide minimal adverse risk participant . Participants randomise either Experimental Control group . Participants , family member , assessor take outcome measure point PTA resolution one-month post-resolution blind group allocation subsequent intervention protocol . Intervention provision occur throughout progression PTA post-intervention assessment occur within 3 day end PTA , one month come PTA , follow-up questionnaire complete participant family member 6 month post-injury . All intervention non-invasive involve risk may incur participation standard rehabilitation process . The Experimental group follow intervention protocol involve transformation participantÂ´s room sensory stimulate enrich environment ( EE ) participation occupation-based multisensory stimulation ( OBMS ) therapy session occupational therapist . They receive two daily 30-minute individual therapy session . The control group follow current protocol patient PTA Institut Guttmann . This include one 30-minute individual therapy session one hour group therapy session occupational therapist minimal change room ( e.g . orientation board , photo family friend ) .</detailed_description>
