	<brief_summary>Craniopharyngioma rare brain tumor affect child adult . It arise region brain near pituitary gland , visual pathway , central blood vessel . Patients often present headache , loss vision delay growth . In instance may present imbalance water salt body . The treatment craniopharyngioma may radical surgery combination surgery radiation therapy . In instance surgery require . If tumor completely remove , radiation therapy may require . In study use advance form proton therapy call intensity-modulated proton therapy . This new form radiation therapy number advantage old form proton therapy conventional radiation therapy use x-ray . The main goal study learn proton therapy effectively treat patient craniopharyngioma brain tumor reduce side effect compare traditional form radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study include participant diagnose presume craniopharyngioma base neuroimaging , intra-operative assessment , evaluation cyst fluid tissue limit radical surgery . When possible , participant enrol protocol prior surgery . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To estimate distribution progression-free overall survival child young adult craniopharyngioma treat intensity-modulated proton therapy monitoring excessive central nervous system necrosis , clinically significant vasculopathy , permanent neurological condition deficit . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To estimate cumulative incidence cystic intervention event-free survival distribution child young adult craniopharyngioma treat intensity-modulated proton therapy ; compare distribution progression-free , event-free overall survival distribution St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) cohort patient treat photon therapy design trial base . - To estimate cumulative incidence cystic intervention distribution progression-free survival , overall survival event-free survival child young adult craniopharyngioma treated primary surgical resection compare distribution distribution observe patient treated proton therapy . OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES : - To explore potential association clinical treatment factor incidence severity neurological , endocrine cognitive deficit child young adult craniopharyngioma treated radical surgery proton therapy . Descriptively compare finding patient treat proton therapy report finding update SJCRH cohort treat photon therapy . - Using specific measure sleep quality , excessive daytime sleepiness , daytime activity , circadian rhythm , fatigue , symptom distress , quality life , explore association sleep , fatigue quality life measure central nervous system ( CNS ) effect , clinical treatment factor child young adult craniopharyngioma treated radical surgery proton therapy . - To evaluate explore difference physical performance movement child young adult craniopharyngioma treated radical surgery proton therapy , use specific measure overall physical performance , flexibility , balance , coordination , muscle strength power , cardiopulmonary fitness . - Estimate compare response residual tumor incidence severity structural , functional vascular effect normal brain child young adult craniopharyngioma treatment radical surgery proton therapy use specific method diffusion , contrast-enhancement , vascular functional neuroimaging , explore association measure CNS effect clinical treatment factor . - Investigate feasibility use positron emission tomography ( PET ) vivo dose distal edge verification system craniopharyngioma patient treat proton therapy . - Measure growth factor cytokine responses child young adult craniopharyngioma treatment radical surgery proton therapy , explore association measure CNS effect clinical treatment factor . Descriptively compare finding patient treat proton therapy report finding update SJCRH cohort treat photon therapy .</detailed_description>
