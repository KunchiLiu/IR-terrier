	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct single center study control study involve 20 patient Type 2 Diabetes hypertension randomly assign receive ramipril 10mg perindopril 8mg . The primary endpoint difference urine albumin-creatinine ratio night time day . Secondary endpoint measurement blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perindopril v Ramipril Persistence MAU Reduction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design/Method This single arm , prospective , randomize , single blind , open label cross-over study urine albumin excretion day night 12 week therapy either perindopril 8 mg per day ramipril 10 mg per day people diabetes . Men woman eligible study meet follow criterion : Age &gt; 18 year , type 2 diabetes adequate blood sugar control ( Hemoglobin A1c ( A1c ) &lt; 8.4 % ) , therapy ace inhibitor ( ACEi ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) period 8 week prior throughout screen period along blood pressure ( BP ) &lt; 130/80 mmHg , know abnormal albuminuria least 12 week screen throughout screen period define ( urine albumin albumin-creatinine ratio ( ACR ) &gt; 5.0 men woman 50 mg/mmol ) . Exclusion criterion include : woman pregnant lactate , woman childbearing age contraception , dual therapy ARB ACEi , 8 week prior screen visit screen period , allergy history cough ACEi , know hypersensitivity study medication diluent constituent study medication , poorly control hypertension ( HTN ) require change dose ACEi ARB within 8 week screen visit , change urine albumin â‰¥ 2x previous level screen level stable drug dosing , myocardial infarction within 12 week screen , congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class IV ) , severe coronary artery disease , severe liver disease , renal artery stenosis . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion enrol study randomize . Following , eligible patient switch exist renin angiotensin aldosterone system ( RAAS ) blocker ramipril 10 mg daily 1 week determine ramipril tolerate . They enter stabilization phase 12 week uninterrupted ramipril therapy . Patients assign receive either perindopril 8 mg daily 10 mg ramipril daily base randomization code open label fashion . Treatment either therapy 12 week . At end treatment period patient instruct collect three set spot urine sample reflect night day urine albumin excretion . Additionally , patient instruct take four home blood pressure measurement , 2 morning 2 evening . The morning recording do medication take . At end 12 week treatment period , measurement urine electrolyte , A1c , urea , creatinine also collect . A 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) also complete end last two treatment period . Laboratory Procedures : Ambulatory blood pressure measure performed period 24 hour use clinically validate device ( model 90270 , Spacelabs Medical Inc. , Redmond , Washington , USA ) . The machine instruct measure blood pressure every 15 minute throughout day ( 7:00am 11:00 PM ) every 30 minute 11:00pm 7:00am . Patients instruct remain motionless every time device active . Values obtain averaged hour calculate day , night average 24hr blood pressure . During 12th week treatment period , urine collect patient quantitatively measure urine sodium , potassium , urea , creatinine . AER measure urine collect standard condition . Three specimen collect treatment period result analyze immunoassay . Statistical Analysis : Statistical analysis data perform mean SAS statistical software Windows ( SAS. , Cary , North Carolina ) result express mean ( SD ) .</detailed_description>
