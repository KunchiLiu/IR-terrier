	<brief_summary>The goal research study improve self-management pain , stress , cognitive/affective symptom may result adult inpatient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) determine feasibility self-management guide relaxation ( GR ) stress reduction intervention use tablet-based mobile device . Currently , opioid analgesic primarily use treat SCD pain self-managed behavioral modality GR , rarely used , particularly , inpatient setting . Little known effect mechanisms GR pain , stress , cognitive/affective symptom adult SCD hospitalize pain . Emerging evidence hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) axis theory offer insight understand mechanism . Adding GR supplement analgesic therapy address dearth self-management strategy control pain SCD . GR simple cost-effective non-drug intervention could reduce pain stress inpatient SCD . GR intervention inpatient SCD direct listen view audio-visual recording visualize immerse scenario .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Feasibility PAINReportIt Guided Relaxation Intervention-INPATIENT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study see new computerized stress reduction program , call PAINReportIt Guided Relaxation Intervention , use teach people sickle cell disease ( SCD ) track stress pain daily use guide audio-visual relaxation exercise help reduce stress pain . To obtain preliminary data large trial , 30 adult inpatient SCD admit SCD pain recruit . The investigator stratify patient bad pain intensity ( &lt; =5 &gt; 5 ) randomly assign 15 adult Attention Control ( 12-min SCD experience discussion Day 1 daily stress/pain tracking Days 2-4 ) 15 adult Experimental ( 12-min GR video clip Day 1 daily stress/pain track GR Days 2-4 ) group . Immediate effect pain , stress , relaxation response 12-min session examine . Patients continue trial additional 4 day , self-management Days 2-4 posttest Day 5 hospitalize test short-term effect . During Days 2-4 , experimental group choose watch six video clip ( 2 min , 5 min , 8 min , 10 min , 15 min , 20 min length ) least day ; stress onset often need . We investigate mechanism GR produce effect adult inpatient SCD .</detailed_description>
