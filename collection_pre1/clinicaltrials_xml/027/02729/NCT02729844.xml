	<detailed_description>Background : The development complete premature bear child . For example , lung fully develop . This associated shortness breath increase oxygen need . Some child need ventilation support develop condition Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . BPD consider lung injury 28 day ventilation support . These child need oxygen extra sensitive infection . In present era , BPD often occur extremely premature infant bear 24-28 week ' post menstrual age , show less severe acute respiratory symptom require less respiratory support BPD patient traditionally past . Histological examination 'new BPD ' patient suggest extreme preterm birth combination perinatal lung injury affect normal growth lung development , result disrupt vascular growth impaired alveolarization , could result PH , high blood pressure lung . The causal relation among prenatal factor , prematurity , BPD PH fully know yet . In premature newborn , &lt; 30 week , prevalence BPD estimate 30-60 % , prevalence occurrence PH receive significantly less attention estimate vary 18 % total group 30 % BPD-group 50 % severe BPD-group . The development PH complicate postnatal course extreme premature infant . Both early late PH associate poor outcome among preterm infant , without BPD . Recent report suggest morbidity late mortality PH 'new BPD ' high , 48 % mortality 2 year diagnosis PH . The pathogenesis BPD complex know risk factor development severe BPD include maternal neonatal factor , childbearing history , male gender , smoke mother pregnancy , chorioamnionitis , low-birth-weight , gestational age , cholestasis acute lung injury high ventilator setting . Risk factor development PH extreme preterm infant well define . Knowledge prevalence risk factor PH extreme premature infant allow evidence-based screening guideline infant . Also potentially leading prevention complicate condition future , since early intervention possible guidance know risk factor . Early detection lead early thus potentially well treatment PH preterm born infant . Objective study : Primary : To identify incidence prevalence PH premature bear infant without BPD first year life . Secondary : To identify risk factor development PH patient To characterize morbidity survival patient first 2 yrs life . Study design : Prospective Observational Cohort study . Inclusion 2016-2018 , Follow standardize care ( include QoL ) : 6 , 12 24 month correct age . For Neolifes-Heart : echocardiography transcutaneous oxygen measurement perform : 1 ) first week birth , 2 ) 3 month correct age , 3 ) 12 month correct age . Study population : All premature infant , admit neonatology UMCG , bear &lt; 30 week birth weight &lt; 1000 gram , participate NeolifeS . Only child parent give write informed consent include study . Primary study parameter : The echocardiographic presence PH ( incidence point-prevalence ) . Secondary study parameter : Morbidity , Mortality : Quality life questionnaire survival . Maternal factor : mode conception , delivery , preterm premature rupture membrane ( PROM ) , maternal disease history , illnesses gestation , tabacco medication use . Perinatal variable : slow growth pattern utero , prenatal echo finding , PROM , chorioamnionitis , oligohydramnios , birth event , placental histology . Neonatal variable : development BPD , low birth weight , gestational age , skull circumference , pulmonary artificial ventilation variable , oxygen need , presence persistent arterial duct ( PDA ) , medication , infection , renal function , complication ( NEC ) , slow growth gestational age ( GA ) 36wks discharge . : demographic , slow growth , admission , medication , feeding , neurological development , respiratory symptom , lung clear index .</detailed_description>
