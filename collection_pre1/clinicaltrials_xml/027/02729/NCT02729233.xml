	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic relapse inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . UC ongoing disease colon large intestine . Studies show leakiness gut play major role development UC . Leakiness gut condition result damage intestinal lining , make less able protect internal environment well filter need nutrient substance . Some bacteria , toxin , waste normally absorb may get blood stream . Golimumab FDA approve medication use treatment moderate severe ulcerative colitis . The investigator evidence suggest measure leakiness gut use tool call confocal laser endomicroscope may able predict well patient 's body respond treatment UC golimumab . Confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) FDA approve technique look cell patient 's gut colonoscopy ass leakiness gut . The objective study determine leakiness gut patient UC predict response golimumab therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Clinical Response Golimumab With Mucosal Barrier Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective pilot study determine predictive value mucosal barrier dysfunction therapeutic response golimumab UC patient . This objective base investigator 's hypothesis barrier dysfunction potent predictor response anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) therapy . This hypothesis base follow observation : ( 1 ) IBD patient higher gap density higher mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine level ; ( 2 ) high rate response biologic therapy Ulcerative colitis see post-operative patient , 90 % endoscopic remission rate one year ; ( 3 ) prominent barrier dysfunction observe anastomotic site animal model ileal resection . Therefore , investigator hypothesize barrier dysfunction potent predictor therapeutic response golimumab UC patient . In 30 UC patient start golimumab treatment UC ( moderate severe flare , steroid dependence , failure therapy ) , epithelial barrier function characterize use probe-based CLE ( pCLE ) . Six mucosal biopsy collect site ( terminal ileum rectum ) histologic verification pCLE finding baseline , month 12 total 12 research sample per colonoscopy , 24 research biopsy sample course study . The study subject follow total 1 year initial colonoscopy pCLE . The primary study end-point clinical response 3 month follow initiation golimumab . Secondary study endpoint : ( 1 ) The rate clinical remission 3 month follow initiation golimumab . ( 2 ) The rate clinical remission 12 month follow initiation golimumab . ( 3 ) Endoscopic histological evidence mucosal heal one-year follow-up colonoscopy . Clinical Response &amp; Remission definition : ( 1 ) Clinical Remission : partial Mayo score 2 point , without sub-score &gt; 1 . ( 2 ) Clinical Response : reduction partial Mayo UC score ≥ 30 % ≥ 2 point , rectal bleed sub-score ≤ 1 decrease bleed sub-score ≥ 1 . Endoscopic histologic mucosal heal definition : ( 1 ) Endoscopic : Mayo endoscopic score 0 1 . ( 2 ) Histologic : Riley 's histological score ≤ 6 . The investigator proposal base clinical , translational basic evidence barrier dysfunction pathogenesis UC . With development robust prediction model therapeutic response , UC patient treat effectively golimumab . Using stratified approach , high therapeutic response rate may eventually yield new `` intelligent step-up '' treatment strategy personalize medicine era .</detailed_description>
