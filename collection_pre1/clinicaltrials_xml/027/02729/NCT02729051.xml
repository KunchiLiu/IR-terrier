	<criteria>Informed Consent : A sign date write informed consent prior study participation . Type subject : Outsubject . Age : Subjects 40 year age old Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Gender : Male female subject . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation , Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; Hysterectomy ; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) 30 day prior first dose study treatmentand last dose study treatmentand completion followup visit . COPD Diagnosis : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society . Smoking History : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears Screening ( Visit 1 ) [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day divide 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ) ] . Previous smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Note : Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate packyear history . Severity COPD symptom : A score &gt; =10 COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) Screening ( Visit1 ) . Severity COPD Disease : A postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70 Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Existing COPD maintenance treatment : Subject must receive daily maintenance treatment COPD least 3 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Note : Subjects receive need COPD medication eligible . History Exacerbations : Subjects must demonstrate : postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 50 percent predict normal Screening ( Visit 1 ) document history &gt; =1 moderate severe COPD exacerbation 12 month prior Screening postbronchodilator 50 percent = &lt; FEV1 &lt; 80 percent predict normal Screening ( Visit 1 ) document history &gt; =2 moderate exacerbation document history &gt; =1 severe COPD exacerbation ( hospitalise ) 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Notes : Percent predict calculated use European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equation ; A document history COPD exacerbation ( e.g. , medical record verification ) medical record worsen COPD symptom require systemic/oral corticosteroid and/or antibiotic ( moderate exacerbation ) hospitalisation ( severe exacerbation ) . Prior use antibiotic alone qualify exacerbation history unless use associate treatment worsen symptom COPD , increase dyspnoea , sputum volume , sputum purulence ( colour ) . Subject verbal report acceptable . French subject : In France , subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Asthma : Subjects current diagnosis asthma . ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible current diagnosis COPD , primary cause respiratory symptom ) . Alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency : Subjects alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD . Other respiratory disorder : Subjects active tuberculosis exclude . Subjects respiratory disorder ( e.g . clinically significant : bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease ) exclude condition primary cause respiratory symptom . Lung resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery ( include procedure endobronchial valve ) within 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Risk Factors Pneumonia : immune suppression ( e.g . advanced human immune deficiency virus ( HIV ) high viral load low cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) count , Lupus immunosuppressant would increase risk pneumonia ) risk factor pneumonia ( e.g . neurological disorder affect control upper airway , Parkinson 's Disease , Myasthenia Gravis ) .

Unstable life threaten cardiac disease : subject follow Screening ( Visit 1 ) would exclude : Myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month ; Unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month ; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class 4 Heart failure . Abnormal clinically significant 12Lead ECG finding : Investigators provide ECG review conduct centralized independent cardiologist assist evaluation subject eligibility . The investigator determine clinical significance abnormal ECG find relation subject 's medical history exclude subject would undue risk participate trial . An abnormal clinically significant finding would preclude subject enter trial define 12lead tracing interpret , limited , follow : atrial fibrillation ( AF ) rapid ventricular rate &gt; 120 beat per minute ( BPM ) ; sustain nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ; Second degree heart block Mobitz type II third degree heart block ( unless pacemaker defibrillator insert ) . Contraindications : A history allergy hypersensitivity corticosteroid , anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist , beta2agonist , lactose/milk protein magnesium stearate medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction , opinion investigator contraindicates study participation . Cancer : Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 3 year . Subjects carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude base 3 year wait period subject consider cured treatment . Oxygen therapy : Use longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) describe rest oxygen therapy &gt; 3 Liters per minute ( Oxygen use &lt; = 3 Liters/minute flow exclusionary . ) Medication prior spirometry : Subjects medically unable withhold albuterol/salbutamol 4hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . Drug/alcohol abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year . Noncompliance : Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Any infirmity , disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Questionable validity consent : Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study . Affiliation investigator site : Study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator study site , immediate family member aforementioned involved study . Inability read : In opinion investigator , subject unable read and/or would able complete study related material . Medication prior Screening : Use follow medication within 30 day prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) requirement use study : Use long term continuous antibiotic therapy ; systemic , oral , parenteral corticosteroid ( Intraspinal intraarticular injection allow ) ; use investigational drug : within 30 day 5 half life whichever longer .</criteria>
