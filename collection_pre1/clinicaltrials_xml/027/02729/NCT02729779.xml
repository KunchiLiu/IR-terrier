This randomize control trial two arm blind assessor include 74 patient age 65 85 year , sex , complain chronic non-specific low back pain persist three month pain intensity great 3 point Pain Numerical Rating Scale . The elderly randomize two group : Pilates Group ( n = 37 ) exercise base Pilates method ; Aerobic Group ( n = 37 ) aerobic exercise , stretch relaxation . Both group hold treatment twice week duration 60 minute eight week . The primary outcome : pain intensity general disability assess eight week randomization . Secondary outcome : pain intensity general disability evaluate six month randomization ; global impression improvement , specific disability dynamic balance , muscle strength gluteus maximus , gluteus medius lateral hip rotators pressure pain threshold evaluate eight week six month randomization . We expect result study contribute clinical decision-making respect pain reduction , consequently , improve balance functionality elderly chronic low back pain .</brief_summary>
