	<brief_summary>Randomized , control , double blind clinical trial 2 stage ( adult stage , infant stage ) . The first stage include 18 HIV uninfected , QFT negative , BCG vaccinate , adult participant , randomize 1:1 receive BCG Vaccine SSI MTBVAC equivalent dose ( 5x10E05 CFU/0.1mL ) ( n=9 group ) . Upon favourable safety review DSMB 18 adult day 28 study vaccination , second stage commence thirty-six ( 36 ) HIV unexposed , BCG naïve , newborn infant , randomize 1:3 receive BCG Vaccine SSI MTBVAC one three different dose level ( ( n=9 group ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-escalation Safety Immunogenicity Study Compare MTBVAC BCG Newborns With Safety Arm Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult Stage : Eighteen ( 18 ) adult participant recruit randomize equally 1 2 study group ( n=9 per group ) : MTBVAC high dose group ( approx . 5x10E05 CFU/0.1mL ) BCG SSI standard human dose ( approx . 5x10E05 CFU/0.1mL ) . Safety assessment conduct D0 , D7 , D14 , D28 , D56 , D90 , D180 post study vaccination . A diary card use collect solicit local , regional , systemic adverse event data D0 D14 . Reactogenicity data collect study visit . Non-serious adverse event collect D28 . Serious adverse event collect entire study period . Infant Stage : Thirty-six ( 36 ) infant participant recruit , randomize allocate 4 group 9 participant : BCG ( single dose level 2.5 x 10E05 CFU/0.05 mL ) ; MTBVAC three different dose level ( low 2.5x10E03 CFU/0.05mL , middle 2.5x10E04 CFU/0.05mL , high 2.5x10E05 CFU/0.05mL ) . Vaccination neonates stagger cohort 3 verum : 1 control basis allow gradual evaluation safety reactogenicity , follow : Cohort 1 : 9 receive low MTBVAC dose level 3 BCG control ; Cohort 2 : 9 receive high MTBVAC dose level 3 BCG control ; Cohort 3 : 9 receive high MTBVAC dose level 3 BCG control . All AEs biochemical haematological parameter ( safety data ) collect Day 28 vaccination last subject cohort review DSMB authorize progression next group . Safety assessment conduct D0 , D7 , D14 , D28 , D70 , D90 , D180 D360 post study vaccination . A diary card use collect solicit local , regional , systemic adverse event data D0 D14 . Reactogenicity data collect study visit . Non-serious adverse event collect D28 . Serious adverse event collect entire study period . Unscheduled follow-up face-to-face visit perform needed safety adverse event management .</detailed_description>
