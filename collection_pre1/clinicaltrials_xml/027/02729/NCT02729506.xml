	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) primary liver cancer . It 6th common malignancy 3rd killer tumor worldwide incidence 626,000 new patient year . The intermediate stage HCC control radiological intervention Transarterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) Radioembolization . Although 90Y radioembolization increasingly use clinical practice , high quality clinical evidence justify . To date , prospective study perform compare treatment modality ( TACE vs 90Y ) randomize set . This randomize controlled trial design prospectively compare TACE 90Y treatment patient unresectable ( BCLC intermediate stage ) HCC . This do recruiting 75 patient arm . Investigators compare two group time progression ( TTP ) primary outcome also examine time local progression ( TLP ) well factor like overall survival , response therapy , toxicity adverse event , quality life treatment-related cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Radioembolization Versus Chemoembolization Treatment Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale : Although 90Y increasingly used clinical practice , high quality clinical evidence justify . Most comparison study retrospective . Three study compare TACE 90Y retrospectively . The first Kooby et al patient treat TACE retrospectively compare treat 90Y suggested treatment modality similar effectiveness safety profile patient unresectable HCC . Earlier Carr et al carry similar retrospective analysis conclude Chemoembolization Radioembolization appear equivalent regional therapy patient unresectable , non-metastatic HCC . More recently Salem et al retrospectively compare 122 HCC patient receive chemo-embolization 123 patient receive Radioembolization conclude patient group similar survival time . Radioembolization result longer time-to-progression less toxicity chemo-embolization . A study down-staging HCC beyond Milan criterion compare 90Y TACE conclude 90Y outperforms TACE down-staging HCC within transplant criterion . TACE-DEB standardized form TACE good efficacy safety profile ideal use define position 90Y locoregional treatment HCC . To date , prospective study perform compare treatment modality randomize set . This randomize controlled trial design prospectively compare TACE 90Y treatment patient unresectable ( BCLC intermediate stage ) HCC . Known Potential Benefits : Chemo-embolization standard treatment intermediate HCC know efficacy predict toxicity . The arrival TAC-DEBs make TACE efficient , less toxic standardize . Y90 Radioembolization know efficacy minimal toxicity base cohort study . Head head comparison never conduct .</detailed_description>

The diagnosis HCC establish either cyto/histology ; , characteristic imaging study patient cirrhosis liver and/or chronic viral hepatitis B C infection . Patients must less 18 80 either gender . Patients must performance status ECOG score equal less 2 . ChildPugh 's A Early B , score 8 ( see table ) Patients must adequate organ function evidence : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥50 x 109/L Hg &gt; 9 g/d . AST ALT ≤5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤2 x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min ( estimate Cockcroft Gault measure ) Normal mg K Bleeding diathesis Vit . K therapy .

Female patient childbearing age must negative pregnancy test . No known HIV infection . Patients metastasis outside liver . Patients comorbid condition aggravate investigational drug intervention . Patients severe cardiopulmonary disease ( include history stable , effortinduced unstable angina pectoris myocardiac infarction ) systemic diseases poor control . Patients active infection . Patients history psychiatric disorder . Patients concomitant active secondary malignancy , except surgically cure carcinoma situ cervix basal adequately treat squamous cell carcinoma skin . Diseasefree malignancy &lt; 2 year study , eligible . Clinically significant third space fluid accumulation ( i.e. , ascites require paracentesis despite use diuretic ) pleural effusion either require thoracocentesis associate shortness breath Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection . Concurrent usage hormonal chemotherapeutic agent . Patients receive surgery , radiotherapy except bone , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , investigational drug within 4 week initiate study eligible . Patients pregnant , breastfeed use appropriate birth control course study . Patients partner child bearing age willing use appropriate contraceptive 8 week therapy . Non compliance . Unwilling disclose medical information .</criteria>
