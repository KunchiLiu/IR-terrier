	<brief_summary>Our goal improve self-management pain stress adult outpatient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) determine feasibility self-managed guided relaxation ( GR ) stress reduction intervention use tablet-based mobile device . Currently , opioid analgesic primarily use treat SCD pain self-managed behavioral modality GR , rarely use . Little known effect mechanisms GR pain stress , adult SCD . Emerging evidence hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) axis theory offer insight understand mechanism . Adding GR supplement analgesic therapy address paucity self-management strategy control pain SCD . GR simple cost-effective non-drug intervention could reduce pain stress outpatient SCD . GR intervention outpatient SCD direct listen view audio-visual recording visualize immersed scene .</brief_summary>

The immediate intervention effect examine pain ( primary ) stress ( secondary ) outcome . Vital sign determine relaxation response ( mediator ) collect immediately 12-min intervention .</detailed_description>
