	<brief_summary>This study conduct determine alter renal function affect plasma pharmacokinetics gepotidacin , inform dose recommendation base upon renal impairment require . The objective study compare pharmacokinetics gepotidacin administer 750 milligram ( mg ) intravenous ( IV ) dose normal healthy subject compare subject mild , moderate , severe renal impairment , subject end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . This Phase I , nonrandomized , open-label , parallel-group , multi-center , multi-part study . In Part 1 , 16 subject normal renal function match approximately 8 subject moderate renal impairment , approximately 8 subject severe renal impairment and/or subject ESRD hemodialysis total approximately 32 subject . In Part 2 ( optional ) , approximately 4 8 subject normal renal function ( enrol ) , approximately 4 8 subject mild renal impairment , approximately 4 8 subject ESRD hemodialysis enrol total approximately 12 24 subject . The duration Screening Follow-up Visit approximately 44 day Part 1 approximately 50 day Part 2 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age : Male female subject 18 80 year age , inclusive . Healthy subject must clinically stable health determine investigator base medical history , clinical laboratory result ( serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis , serology ) , vital sign measurement , 12 lead ECG result , physical examination finding . Subject renal impairment must clinical laboratory value consistent disease approve investigator . Subject renal impairment ( mild , moderate , severe , subject ESRD ) may take medication , opinion investigator , believe therapeutic affect study drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion . These medication must stable dos take least 7 day first dose study drug . Subject normal renal function renal impairment ( estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate [ eGFR ] correspond calculate eGFR [ estimate eGFR may round near integer ] ) Screening . Subjects ESRD hemodialysis hemodialysis least 3 month Screening able tolerate hemodialysis treatment last 3 4 hour blood flow rate &gt; 200 milliliter ( mL ) /minute ( min ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) bilirubin &lt; 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ; isolate bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN acceptable , bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Body weight &gt; =50 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 18.5 40 kg/square meter ( m^2 ) , inclusive . Male Female . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation , Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , Hysterectomy , Documented bilateral oophorectomy Postmenopausal define 12 month continuous spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample obtain test simultaneous folliclestimulating hormone ) estradiol level consistent menopause . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . Reproductive potential agrees follow 1 option list GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential requirement 30 day prior first dose completion Followup Visit . For subject indeterminate pregnancy test result persistently low human chorionic gonadotropin result , nonpregnancy status must document mean ( subject ESRD ) . Capable give sign informed consent describe protocol , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Subject clinically significant abnormality past medical history Screening physical examination ( exclude renal insufficiency relate stable medical condition within renally impaired population subject [ e.g. , hypertension , diabetes , anemia , stable least 3 month first dose study drug ] ) investigator 's opinion may place subject risk interfere outcome variable study . This include , limited , history current cardiac , hepatic , neurologic , gastrointestinal ( GI ) , respiratory , hematologic , immunologic disease . Subject surgical medical condition ( active chronic ) may interfere drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion study drug , condition may place subject risk , opinion investigator . Subject function renal transplant . Subject renal impairment systolic blood pressure outside range 90 200 millimeter mercury ( mm Hg ) , diastolic blood pressure outside range 45 110 mm Hg , heart rate outside range 40 120 beat per minute ( bpm ) . Subject renal impairment hemoglobin value &lt; 9 gram ( g ) /decilitre ( dL ) . Female subject positive pregnancy test result lactate Screening upon admission clinic . Use systemic antibiotic within 30 day Screening Within 2 month Screening , either confirm history Clostridium difficile diarrhoea infection past positive Clostridium difficile toxin test . Subject history drug and/or alcohol abuse within 6 month Screening , determine investigator , subject positive drug screen Screening upon admission clinic . For subject renal impairment , positive drug screen result relate use prescription medication allow per investigator review approval , tetrahydrocannabinol use allow per investigator review approval . History sensitivity study drug , component thereof , history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) medical monitor , contraindicate participation . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia ( clinic us heparin maintain IV cannula patency ) . Subject used medication know affect elimination serum creatinine ( e.g. , trimethoprim cimetidine ) competitor renal tubular secretion ( e.g. , probenecid ) within 30 day dose . Subjects use overthecounter , prescription medication ( except hormonal contraceptive and/or acetaminophen ) , vitamin supplement , herbal medication within 7 day ( 5 halflives , whichever long ) dose study within 7 day dose study . Subjects normal renal function presence hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis C antibody test result Screening within 3 month prior first dose study treatment . A subject renal impairment stable hepatitis C normal liver function test result allow investigator approval . A positive test human immunodeficiency virus antibody . Subject clinically significant abnormal finding serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis result obtain Screening Day 1 ( Day 7 Group F ) , associate underlying renal condition stable medical condition consistent disease process . Subject normal renal function baseline correct QT interval use Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) subject renal impairment baseline QTcF &gt; 480 msec . Donation blood excess 500 mL within 12 week prior dose participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Previous exposure gepotidacin within 12 month prior first dose day . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Subject unable comply study procedure , opinion investigator . The subject participate study , opinion investigator Sponsor .</criteria>
