	<detailed_description>In response result Tolvaptan Efficacy Safety Management Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Its Outcomes ( TEMPO 3:4 ) , use tolvaptan approve Japan since March 2014 treat autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) . In March 2015 , tolvaptan approve Canadian Government , European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) Committee Medicinal Products Human Use ( CHMP ) . Additionally , approval European country anticipate . Kyorin University Hospital start administer tolvaptan patient May 2014 . As dose condition clinical set different TEMPO study , enable investigation factor address TEMPO study . A longitudinal clinical study investigate change administration tolvaptan patient whose clinical course monitor prior approval tolvaptan employ method different use TEMPO study . The propose clinical study ideally conduct jointly multiple center . However , since April 2014 , hospital employ volumetric method use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure total kidney volume ( TKV ) . Also , hospital adopt volumetric method measure TKV prior approval . Consequently , study perform solely Kyorin University . This prospective comparative study `` investigate therapeutic effect administer tolvaptan patient autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease '' base `` Ethical Guidelines Medical Health Research Involving Human Subjects '' promulgate December 22 , 2014 Ministry Education , Culture , Sports , Science Technology Ministry Health , Labour Welfare . The study include ADPKD patient participate precede study conduct Kyorin University School Medicine Urology Department , ADPKD Research Section , Radiology Department ( prospective , retrospective study ) .</detailed_description>
