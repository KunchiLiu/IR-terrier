	<brief_summary>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) emerge treatment medically refractory major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . rTMS involves direct stimulation cortical neuron use externally apply , powerful , focused magnetic field pulse . Dozens study several meta-analyses last 15 year show rTMS dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) produce statistically significant improvement MDD , even medication fail . However , possible target may also yield improvement symptom . In attempt enhance therapeutic efficacy current intervention TRD , attention turn identifying domain-specific biomarkers hop ultimately individualizing predict treatment response . Unfortunately , precise nature relationship less clear , reflect fact even establish biomarkers use routinely clinical practice aid diagnosis . This study also seek examine comprehensive suite biomarker measurement ( MRI , neurophysiology , genomics/proteomics ) rTMS treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>rTMS Health-Canada- FDA-approved treatment treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) , use focused magnetic field pulse stimulate brain region involve emotion regulation , safely non-invasively . Though rTMS often effective medication therapy fail , require series lengthy ( ~30-40 min ) treatment session . A new form rTMS call theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) show great effect neural activity conventional stimulation , despite require little 40 stimulation . The purpose study assess efficacy tolerability accelerate TBS protocol , administer 2 time day patient TRD . In addition , investigator aim identify candidate biomarkers multimodal suite neuroimaging , neurophysiologic molecular measure predictor correlate response rTMS treatment .</detailed_description>
