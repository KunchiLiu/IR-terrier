	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose ceritinib give together brentuximab vedotin see well work treat treatment-naive patient anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) -positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma . Ceritinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , brentuximab vedotin , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving ceritinib together brentuximab vedotin may better treatment ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ceritinib With Brentuximab Vedotin Treating Patients With ALK-Positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define dose ceritinib administer concurrently brentuximab vedotin acceptable toxicity profile ( base dose-limiting toxicity [ DLT ] rate ) sufficient efficacy ( base response rate ) among patient treatment-naive anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) , ALK-positive . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumor activity ceritinib brentuximab vedotin combination treatment-naive patient ALCL , ALK-positive . II . To assess utility molecular marker ALCL , ALK-positive patient 's plasma , therapy disease risk assessment post-treatment monitoring . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ceritinib follow phase II study . Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive ceritinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 8-21 course 1 day 1-21 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
