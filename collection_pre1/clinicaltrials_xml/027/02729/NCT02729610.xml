	<brief_title>Bronchial Blocker One-lung Ventilation Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative hoarseness , sore throat , vocal cord injury common complication general anesthesia . The incidence postoperative hoarseness frequent 50 % short-term tracheal intubation . In past , several risk factor postoperative hoarseness laryngeal injury identify , include demographic factor , quality tracheal intubation technical factor endotracheal tube size . One-lung ventilation thoracotomy achieve via two basic technique : ( 1 ) use double-lumen endotracheal tube ( DLT ) consist endotracheal endobronchial lumen allow independent single-lung ventilation ; ( 2 ) use endobronchial blocker Arndt blocker , allow lung collapse distal occlusion . It recently demonstrate DLT endobronchial blocker similar efficacy achieve lung isolation elective thoracic surgery . No data available yet influence chosen technique postoperative hoarseness , vocal cord injury , sore throat , bronchial injury . Published data Stout et al . imply incidence postoperative hoarseness vocal cord injury might directly correlate size use endotracheal tube . During thoracoscope assist mitral valve replacement cardiac surgery , excellent lung isolate require . One-lung ventilation lung collapse use achieve well exposure assist surgery . During cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass , heparinization lead uncontrolled hemorrhage endotracheal tube insertion associate injury . In addition , DLTs need exchange single-lumen tube patient transfer cardiac care unit postoperative ventilatory support . This may result second time injury . Investigators hypothesize use bronchial blocker achieve one-lung ventilation may result low incidence clinically relevant laryngeal bronchial morbidity thoracoscope assist mitral valve replacement cardiac surgery compare control group intubate DLT .</detailed_description>
