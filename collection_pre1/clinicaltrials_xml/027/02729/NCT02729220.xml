	<detailed_description>The age-related impairment innate immunity antioxidant defenses likely impact development disease progression chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , COPD . It suggest aging-related decline function accelerate COPD due recurrent cycle inflammation , tissue injury repair , associate long-term exposure cigarette smoke airway irritant . Here , investigator aim follow previous observation impair antioxidant response lung COPD patient , establish extent reflect accelerate age phenotype , characterize molecular mechanism result functional deficiency . The proposed study employ well-characterized patient COPD vary severity smoking habit , well carefully age smoke history-matched control . Accelerated age within COPD lung assess endobronchial mucosal biopsy airway macrophage assessment establish senescence marker use immunohistochemical , biochemical PCR-based method . These marker tissue age relate functional activation transcription factor , know induced oxidative stress relate cytoprotection Nrf2 AP1 . The investigator also examine whether COPD associate enhanced secretion inflammatory mediator senescent cell , consistent accelerate age paradigm establish influence cell function . Deficiencies metal handling , antioxidant defense diminish airway innate immune defense air-lung interface assess . The aim identify biomarkers risk rapid lung function deterioration COPD patient .</detailed_description>
