	<brief_title>Comparison Efficacy Safety Between Medical Radiation Protectants ( FORRAD® ) Trolamine ( Biafine ) Management Radiation Dermatitis Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Receiving IMRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) one common malignance South China . Radiation therapy remain principal treatment NPC . One frequently occur radiation-related side effect include radiation-induced skin reaction ( RISR ) , also know radiation dermatitis , affect 90 % cancer patient receive radiation therapy . Although intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) widely use China nowadays , radiation dermatitis still common . It often characterize edema , erythema , change pigmentation , fibrosis , ulceration , may cause sign symptom , skin dryness , itch discomfort , pain , warmth , burn . Radiation dermatitis impact pain quality life patient group , severe , may lead interruption radiation schedule patient . A variety intervention use prophylaxis management radiation dermatitis . However , recent overview systematic review meta-analysis randomize control trial conclude use intervention yet support conclusive evidence therefore warrant investigation . Trolamine ( Biafine ; Genmedix Ltd , France ) oil-in-water emulsion enhance skin heal recruiting macrophage modify concentration various immunomodulators . In China , Trolamine commonly prescribe begin radiotherapy prevent acute radiation-induced skin toxicity . However , long grade ≥2 radiation dermatitis develop , Trolamine allow use . Medical Radiation Protectants ( FORRAD® ) new kind topical agent prevention treatment radiation dermatitis . It could use course radiotherapy , even grade ≥2 dermatitis develop . The primary aim randomize phase II study ass effectiveness safety Medical Radiation Protectants ( FORRAD® ) prevention treatment acute radiation-induced dermatitis grade 3 high IMRT patient NPC , compare trolamine .</detailed_description>
