	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well tethered capsule endoscope work screen patient Barrett esophagus ( BE ) , condition line esophagus change replace abnormal cell may lead cancer also call esophageal cancer . In attempt prevent progression BE esophageal cancer , patient undergo standard procedure call esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) patient sedate doctor us endoscope examine tissue esophagus . Tethered capsule endoscope tiny capsule laser scan inside thin cord attach . Patients swallow capsule thin cord keep capsule specific area esophagus . After picture line esophagus take , capsule remove use thin cord . Tethered capsule endoscope may able identify tissue change patient BE without need sedation anesthesia , thus eliminate associated risk cost associate EGD .</brief_summary>
