	<brief_summary>Balloon predilatation aortic valve regard essential step transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) procedure . However , recent evidence suggest aortic valvuloplasty may harmful high success rate may obtain without prior dilatation valve . We hypothesize TAVI perform without predilatation use new generation balloon expandable prothesis associate well net clinical benefit comparison procedure perform pre dilatation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAVI Without Balloon Predilatation ( Aortic Valve ) SAPIEN 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) standard care inoperable patient severe symptomatic aortic stenosis accept alternative surgery high-risk patient . Despite high procedure success rate ( &gt; 95 % ) , TAVI remain associated complication directly relate technique ( stroke , aortic regurgitation , vascular access bleed ) co morbidity frequently associate aortic valve disease elderly frail patient . Reducing periprocedural complication thereby key future use TAVI lower-risk patient . Methods/design The transcatheter aortic valve implantation without prior balloon dilatation ( DIRECTAVI ) trial randomize control open label trial include 240 patient randomize TAVI perform prior balloon dilatation valve ( control arm ) direct implantation valve ( test arm ) . The trial test hypothesis strategy direct implantation balloon expandable SAPIEN 3 prosthesis non-inferior current medical practice use predilatation valve . The primary endpoint relate immediate procedural success criterion secondary end point include complication 30-day follow-up ( VARC 2 criterion ) . A subgroup analysis evaluate neurological ischemic event cerebral MRI imaging ( 25 patient strategy group ) perform procedure . In conclusion , hope study provide robust evidence safety efficiency TAVI perform without prior dilatation aortic valve use balloon expandable SAPIEN 3 THV allow interventional cardiologist use strategy everyday practice .</detailed_description>
