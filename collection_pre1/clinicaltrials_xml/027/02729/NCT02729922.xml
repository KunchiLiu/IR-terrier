	<brief_summary>CardioMEMS implantable wireless hemodynamic monitoring system transmit pulmonary artery pressure . This device FDA approve use diagnostic tool help management select heart failure patient . Heart failure patient NYHA class III heart failure , irrespective leave ventricular ejection fraction , previous hospital admission heart failure past 12 month , without stage IV V chronic kidney disease candidate receive CardioMEMS device . Our goal create registry patient receive CardioMEMS device monitor outcome , primarily heart failure hospitalization , heart failure relate quality life re-admissions .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Clinical trial CardioMEMS do device FDA approve use heart failure patient NYHA class III heart failure least three month , irrespective leave ventricular ejection fraction , previous hospitalization heart failure last 12 month . Patients chronic kidney disease stage IV V exclude . Briefly , CHAMPION Trial , publish Lancet ( Lancet 2011 ; 377 : 658-66 ) , enrol patient 64 center USA randomly assign use centralize electronic system management CardioMEMS control group . The patient follow six month . The treatment group use daily measure pulmonary artery pressure addition standard care versus standard care alone control group . The protocol treatment group lower pulmonary artery pressure elevate , use neurohormonal , diuretic , vasodilator drug . The control group continue drug change response patient ' clinical sign symptom rather pulmonary artery pressure . All patient optimum drug device therapy time sensor implantation accordance ACC AHA guideline . At six month treatment group 37 % reduction heart failure relate hospitalization , patient day alive outside hospital , good quality life compare control group . A follow study publish Lancet ( Lancet 2016 ; 387:453-461 ) examine extend efficacy strategy 18 month look clinical effect open access pressure information monitor original treatment group additional 13 month . After pulmonary artery pressure information become available guide therapy open access ( device control group activate follow 13 month initial six month ) , rate admission hospital heart failure former control group reduce 48 % compare rate admission control group randomize access ( initial six month ) . These study show short term long term management NYHA Class III heart failure base home transmission pulmonary artery pressure implant pressure sensor significant short-term long-term benefit lower hospital admission rate heart failure . Patients age 18 year old moderate NYHA functional class III heart failure least 3 month , irrespective leave ventricular ejection fraction cause , hospitalization heart failure within past 12 month eligible CardioMEMS device . If patient think good clinical candidate , difficult manage fluid status , patient Heart Failure Cardiologist discus option CardioMEMS device implant standard care treatment . If device implant , patient ask enrolled registry . The patient normal clinical follow clinically standard interrogation . The device interrogation send daily patient review week unless patient call symptom weight gain review time . If change medication make , patient 's device interrogate daily 3 subsequent day return baseline weekly interrogation . The data obtain interrogation pulmonary artery pressure . There research intervention outside normal standard clinical care . All clinically collect data record Penn CardioMEMS registry . Patients follow clinic one month implant , 3 month determine Heart Failure Cardiologist part usual clinical care . A quality life assessment do clinic appointment first year ( Minnesota Living Heart Failure questionnaire ) . Adverse event record occur . There device-related system-related complication bleed complication pressure-sensor failure define inability obtain recording . Of note , clinical trial pressure-sensor failure . The data collect clinical electronic medical record administrative data set University Pennsylvania . Standard statistical method use . Statistical analysis do Wilcoxon rank sum test student 's test alpha=0.05 . Patient survival rate analyze Kaplan-Meier method log-rank test .</detailed_description>
