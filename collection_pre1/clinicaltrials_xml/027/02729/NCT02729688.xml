	<brief_title>Effectiveness Pressure Indicator Guided Conventional Bandaging Treatment Venous Leg Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For treatment venous ulcer , show compression bandage 35-45 mmHg sub-bandage pressure ankle show several study safe effective.The efficacy compression bandage considerably depend applied pressure therefore largely dependent individual applying bandage . The low pressure lead treatment failure high pressure lead skin complication . The use objective device proof bandage sufficiently apply available every patient . To help patient apply bandage optimal pressure , investigator develop customized pressure guide elastic bandage ( CPG-EB ) use sub-bandage pressure guidance . Objective study compare interface pressure apply ordinary elastic bandage ( OEB ) CPG-EB . In addition , investigator compare percentage inexperienced staff could apply optimal pressure OEB CPG-EB .</detailed_description>
