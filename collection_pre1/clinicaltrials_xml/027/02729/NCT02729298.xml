	<brief_summary>TP-0903 novel oral inhibitor target AXL kinase . Preclinical study show promising antitumor activity TP-0903 single agent variety tumor type vitro vivo study . This first-in-human study conduct identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) TP-0903 administer orally patient advance solid tumor . The study investigate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , preliminary anti-tumor activity profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-in-human Study Oral TP-0903 ( Novel Inhibitor AXL Kinase ) Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , first-in-human , open-label , dose-escalation , safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamic study TP-0903 administer daily first 21 28 day . There 2 stage study . In Stage 1 , sequential cohort three ( 3 ) patient treat escalated dos MTD establish . In absence dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , dose increase use modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme . Once MTD establish , 10 additional patient may enrol MTD dose level confirmation safety ( Stage 2 ) . Patients successfully complete 4-week treatment cycle without evidence significant treatment-related toxicity progressive disease permit continue receive treatment dose dose schedule .</detailed_description>
