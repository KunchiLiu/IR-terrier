	<brief_summary>Pazopanib orally administer multi-kinase inhibitor target VEGFR ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ) , PDGFR ( platelet derive growth factor ) c-kit , critical growth proliferation neoplastic cell . Pazopanib FDA approve advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) clear cell component . Conventional Pazopanib dose WITHOUT FOOD initial dose 800 mg mouth daily . Investigators hypothesize administration pazopanib low fat meal would safe feasible secondary implication higher pazopanib level ; potentially translate great anti-tumor efficacy advance renal cell cancer , significant cost saving . In propose pilot study , investigator seek test feasibility practicality approach gather preliminary data adverse effect safety profile . Investigators hope ameliorate potential great toxicity dynamic dose design incorporate adverse event cycle dose next cycle structure symptom specific plan .</brief_summary>
