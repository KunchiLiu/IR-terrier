	<brief_summary>H. pylori infection play important role gastric carcinogenesis , progress chronic gastritis atrophic gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia finally cancer . It difficult diagnose H. pylorus relate gastritis gastric atrophy basis endoscopic finding . Histology currently consider gold standard detect H. pylori infection . The reliability detect H. pylori infection histologically depend site , number , size gastric biopsy specimen . The blind biopsy sample normal appear mucosa risk miss pathology sample error . Most study conclude well expertise stain visualize bacteria . Considerable error also occur identify gastric atrophy use blind biopsy sampling , neither original revise version Sydney system reliably identify half case patient confirm gastric atrophy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NBI widely use system among several available image enhance endoscopy system . However , technique limitation dark image distant lesion narrow-band illumination . Blue Laser Imaging ( BLI ) develop compensate inherent limitation NBI . BLI use narrow-band laser light combine white light . This combination result bright image digestive mucosa , enable detailed visualization microstructure microvasculature . However , BLI still able obtain sufficient brightness distant lesion . The newly develop Linked Color Imaging ( LCI ) system ( FUJIFILM Co. ) create clear bright endoscopic image use short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combine white laser light basis BLI technology . This system obtain bright endoscopic image even distant view LCI intense white light short-wavelength narrow-band laser light . Short-wavelength narrow-band laser light enhances vessel mucosal surface pattern mucosa , mean BLI enables clearer visualization microvascular structure LCI . In contrast , LCI enhance difference hue , red region spectrum , digital processing . This make red area appear red white area appear whiter . Thus , easy recognize slight difference color mucosa . Therefore , LCI may facilitate detection H. pylori infection gastric atrophy . Further study need confirm utility LCI .</detailed_description>
