	<brief_title>Cooperative Pain Education Self-management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) chronic pain commonly use evidence-based self-management intervention . Though effective , CBT require patient attend multiple in-person visit highly trained staff available provide care . For reason CBT resource intensive , often inaccessible Veterans , deliver unevenly across patient facility . In Veterans Health Administration Office Health Services Research Development ( HSR &amp; D ) IIR-funded trial , investigator find CBT deliver primarily via automate Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) system ( Cooperative Pain Education Self-management COPES ) lead patient-centered outcome comparable standard United States Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) approach CBT deliver in-person therapist ten weekly session . In study , implementation facilitation guide Consolidated Framework Implementation Research ( CFIR ) provide set construct identify potential barrier facilitator implementation . The primary objective project evaluate effectiveness facilitation approach pair automated case find direct patient outreach uptake COPES clinical care set . Study investigator specifically target Veterans receive care community-based outpatient clinic ( CBOCs ) sit typically therapist train CBT chronic pain . Description COPES : COPES 10-week , IVR-facilitated program CBT chronic pain . The primary component COPES include : 1 ) self-help handbook teach Veterans pain self-management skill describe weekly skill practice goal , 2 ) pedometer-facilitated progressive walking program ( COPES patient give Omron Go Smart , Model HJ-112 pocket pedometer time enrollment ) , 3 ) daily , automate IVR call collect patient-reported pain intensity pain-related interference , sleep quality , pedometer-measured step count , adherence pain cop skill practice rating . Participants also receive weekly , two four minute pre-recorded , personalized therapist message via IVR system base participant 's IVR-recorded data . Therapists provide feedback participant 's weekly average pain intensity , sleep , step , pain cop skill practice , note change prior week , comment symptom activity pattern . Therapists also provide reinforcement goal accomplishment , help patient make connection among pain , pain coping skill practice , goal accomplishment , assign step skill practice goal upcoming week . Research Design : Study investigator test effectiveness facilitation approach implement COPES mean remotely deliver in-home self-management support Veterans chronic pain . To evaluate implementation 's success , study investigator conduct multi-site , step wedge , Hybrid III trial 17 CBOCs affiliate three geographically disperse site ( VA Boston , VA Palo Alto , Roudebush VA Indianapolis ) . Clusters ( k=17 CBOCs ) randomize 6 different time period proportional approximate eligible patient population size . Each CBOC serve control period time `` transition '' enhance facilitation ; time transition randomize stepped fashion . The primary outcome evaluate implementation success patient enrollment COPES . The secondary outcome provider referral . Other outcome investigate part nest COPES effectiveness study Veterans ' physical functioning , pain intensity , physical activity . Methodology : Study investigator evaluate success implementation strategy evaluate proportion patient offer enrollment COPES actually enroll . Additionally , study investigator conduct formative evaluation inform , refine evaluate implementation COPES . The evaluation include interview VA staff patient chronic back pain propose implementation site . Interview guide base CFIR model construct use question adapt CFIR interview guide . Investigators also measure pre-post difference pain-relevant outcome ( pain intensity , physical function physical activity ) .</detailed_description>
