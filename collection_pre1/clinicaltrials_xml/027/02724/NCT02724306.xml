	<brief_summary>The present study use randomise controlled trial design investigate whether moderate vigorous intensity physical activity ( MVPA ) affect physiological risk marker associate development bowel cancer individual previously diagnose bowel polyp . The study also investigate effect programme long-term exercise behaviour change psychological variable . A selected sample also part individual interview baseline 12 month gauge narrative account personal , psychological sociological belief surround participation physical activity . The finding study might inform good practice prevention bowel cancer high risk population . After screen colonoscopy , eligible participant randomise either active lifestyle programme ( ALP ) standard care group ( SC ) . Participants ALP offer supervised exercise session motivational interview 6 month . Intervention component cease 6 month , participant followed-up 12 month investigate maintenance physical activity long-term . The SC offer intervention end study . Participants group invite assessment baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month . These include measurement body composition , cardiopulmonary fitness , physical activity behaviour , psycho-social variable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : A strong body evidence suggest lifestyle factor influence cancer risk , convince evidence physically activity lifestyle associate reduce risk develop colon cancer . However , low self-reported physical activity level elderly population demonstrate need physical activity intervention patient group evoke meaningful change physical activity behaviour improvement CC risk profile occur . The purpose study investigate effect 6 month physical activity intervention physical activity behaviour biological marker CC risk individual classify elevate risk develop disease follow surveillance colonoscopy . The physical activity intervention underpin Self Determination Theory create autonomy-supportive environment , approach recently show evoke great physical activity level weight loss general health education overweight woman . Secondary outcome explore impact intervention aerobic fitness , health-related quality life psychological variable ( self-efficacy , motivational regulation ) . In addition , interview focus group use obtain narrative account patient experience , perceive health benefit participate intervention barrier facilitator influence adherence . Design The propose study randomise control trial , participant stratify risk status ( determine number size polyp identify colonoscopy ) . Participants randomly allocate either physical activity intervention ( Active Lifestyle Programme : ALP ) usual care control group ( SC ) . Outcomes assessed baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . Participants allocate ALP group attend supervise exercise session facility University East Anglia . These take place twice per week 3 month per week additional 3 month . These supplement home base exercise achieve total 300 minute physical activity week . Supervised exercise session take place small group maximum 7 participant , last approximately 60 minute . The exercise session include 5-10min warm-up period , follow 20-30 min aerobic exercise , 15-20 min resistance exercise . The target intensity exercise 65-85 % maximum heart rate determine cardiopulmonary fitness test . Intensity monitor heart rate monitor rate perceive exhaustion ( Borg Scale ) . A short cool-down period conclude exercise session . In addition , participant offer physical activity counsel workshop lead group , motivational interviewing style . All component intervention undermine Self-determination Theory , facilitate feeling autonomy , competence relatedness . To facilitate behaviour change , participant ALP group provide pedometer educational workbook , contain information benefit physical activity general regard bowel cancer , aid set personalised goal , information relevant physical activity . There also purposefully select sample chosen base prior consent demographic variable take part face face interview 1 12 month . Furthermore 3 focus group contain , participant EX UC group take place alongside focus group Health professional intervention take place . Recruitment Consenting Potential participant either hear study via poster flyer Big C Cancer Charity NNUH approach specialist nurse consultation appointment colonoscopy . However , recruitment procedure path point pre-colonoscopy consultation appointment.On day consultation , nurse inform potential participant study give invitation letter , participant information sheet . At meeting , nurse also provide patient consent form , ask agreement contact researcher . If patient give consent contact , researcher call patient prior screen colonoscopy provide information study , arrange appointment obtain consent biopsy take colonoscopy . If patient diagnose polyp screen colonoscopy , researcher arrange another appointment post-colonoscopy carry baseline assessment obtain full study consent . Baseline assessment include maximal fitness test , assessment current physical activity use accelerometer self-report , questionnaires assess quality life psycho-social variable , body composition . After completion baseline assessment , participant randomise one two study arm . This carry person directly involve research . The person undertake maximal fitness test blind group allocation throughout whole duration study . The person carry intervention blind group allocation .</detailed_description>
