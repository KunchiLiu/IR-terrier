	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT ) For Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Pilot Study , first time investigator examine study intervention ( allogeneic stem cell transplantation ) population ( patient CNS lymphoma ) , type stem cell transplantation . Historically , patient central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) high rate disease relapse initial therapy . Given poor outcome conventional chemotherapy , intense treatment high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) explore , yet relapse remain issue . For old patient , ASCT may feasible give inability tolerate high-doses chemotherapy . In patient systemic NHL relapse ASCT tolerate ASCT , yet responsive chemotherapy , allogeneic stem cell transplant often consider . Allogeneic transplantation think work give recipient entirely new blood system donor . This new blood system include new immune system hopefully attack lymphoma much like would attack bacterial viral infection . Currently , one establish standard care patient lymphoma body relapse initial chemotherapy treatment . The investigator test treatment extend patient lymphoma central nervous system . The following chemotherapy drug include study administer : Fludarabine , Thiotepa , Methotrexate . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve chemotherapy agent individually treatment option disease . The combination approve FDA . Thiotepa Methotrexate show pas blood-brain barrier , highly selective barrier restrict many chemical enter brain spinal cord . Fludarabine backbone chemotherapy reduce intensity conditioning regimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm nonHodgkin lymphoma involve central nervous system ( CNS ) define : Biopsy CNS mass brain , parenchyma , leptomeninges , spinal cord demonstrate NHL . Ocular biopsy retina , subretinal pigment epithelial space , optic nerve , vitrectomy specimen , demonstrate NHL . Biopsy mass lesion outside CNS , blood body fluid specimen , document NHL , conjunction brain spinal CT , PET/CT ( positron emission tomography / compute tomography ) , MRI show radiographic abnormality characteristic CNS involvement lymphoma . CSF cytology demonstrate malignant clonal NHL population , consistent lymphomatous leptomeningitis , without radiographically pathologically identifiable CNS systemic mass lesion . Patients CSF ( cerebral spinal fluid ) study negative NHL cytology positive monoclonal population flow cytometry and/or molecular PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) study may eligible radiographic evidence CNS lymphoma symptom clinically consistent CNS lymphomatous involvement ; case , please contact protocol chair , Dr. Yi Bin Chen , discus eligibility prior enrollment . Patients must experience relapsed disease highdose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) OR experience relapse / progression firstline highdose methotrexatebased therapy candidate ASCT judgment treat physician . Discussion PI encourage latter scenario . All participant must demonstrate partial complete response ( PR CR ) CNS systemic disease preenrollment therapy must PR CR time enrollment . Acceptable therapy include systemic intrathecal chemo/immunotherapy and/or radiotherapy well corticosteroid . Age ≥ 18 year study open site treat adult . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky score ≥ 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Participants must adequate organ function define : Total serum bilirubin within normal institutional limit ( unless patient Gilbert 's syndrome , direct serum bilirubin within normal institutional limit ) . AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3× institutional upper limit normal . Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40 % measure either echocardiogram nuclear cardiac scan . FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume 1 second ) , FVC ( force vital capacity ) DLCO ≥ 50 % predict ( DLCO correct hemoglobin ) . Participants must wellmatched adult donor willing donate peripheral blood stem cell wellmatched define : 8/8 match relate unrelated donor ( HLAA , B , C , DRB1 allele level ) . Because chemotherapy agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 12 month date stem cell transplantation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Eligibility Criteria Donors Donors must medically fit donate peripheral blood stem cell standard GCSF mobilization assess institutional unrelated marrow registry standard . Donors sign study specific inform consent participate give donor undergo standard GCSF mobilization leukapheresis . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior 1st day condition chemotherapy . Participants receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition fludarabine , thiotepa agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study routinely ineligible treat allogeneic stem cell transplantation . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
