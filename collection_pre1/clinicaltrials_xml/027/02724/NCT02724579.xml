	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well reduce dos radiation therapy brain spine ( craniospinal ) chemotherapy work treat patient newly diagnose type brain tumor call WNT ) /Wingless ( WNT ) -driven medulloblastoma . Recent study use chemotherapy radiation therapy show effective treating patient WNT-driven medulloblastoma . However , concern late side effect treatment , learn difficulty , low amount hormone , problem perform daily activity . Radiotherapy use high-energy radiation x-ray kill cancer cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , vincristine sulfate , cyclophosphamide lomustine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving reduced craniospinal radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell may also reduce late side effect treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) child &gt; = 3 year age wingless-type MMTV integration site family ( WNT ) /WNT-driven average-risk medulloblastoma use reduce craniospinal radiotherapy ( CSI ) ( 18 Gray [ Gy ] ) limit target volume boost tumor bed 36 Gy total 54 Gy reduce chemotherapy approach ( vincristine [ vincristine sulfate ] radiotherapy reduced-dose maintenance chemotherapy ) monitor PFS early evidence outcome unacceptable . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively test hypothesis deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation profile result `` real-time '' classification WNT-driven medulloblastoma . II . To use ALTE07C1 protocol prospectively evaluate longitudinally model cognitive , social , emotional behavioral function child treat reduce CSI ( 18 Gy ) limit target volume boost tumor bed ( total 54 Gy ) reduce chemotherapy ( reduce cisplatin , vincristine lomustine [ CCNU ] ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether DNA methylation profile medulloblastoma sample result `` real-time '' predictive classification scheme Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) , Group 3 Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroup accord Heidelberg classifier . OUTLINE : RADIATION THERAPY : Beginning 4-5 week surgery , patient undergo craniospinal radiation therapy 5 day week 6 week . MAITENANCE THERAPY ( WEEKS 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ) : Beginning 4-6 week completion radiation therapy patient receive lomustine orally ( PO ) day 1 , vincristine sulfate intravenously ( IV ) 1 minute via minibag day 1 , 8 , 15 , cisplatin IV 6 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY ( WEEKS 2 , 4 , AND 6 ) : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1 2 , mesna IV 15-30 minute day 1 2 , vincristine sulfate IV 1 minute via minibag day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 6 year .</detailed_description>
