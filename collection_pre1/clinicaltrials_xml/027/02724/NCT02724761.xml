	<brief_summary>Our double-blinded , randomize control trial ass effect nebulized racemic epinephrine inpatient undergo anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) procedure . The investigator success manage post-operative dysphagia patient undergo ACDF administration drug . Half participant review nebulized epinephrine . The half receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Racemic Epinephrine Anterior Cervical Discectomy Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based data National Inpatient Sample 2002-2012 , patient undergo elective primary ACDF , diagnose dysphagia ( 4 % total patient ) , two-fold increase mean length stay ( 4.03 compare 1.56 day ; p &lt; 0.001 ) substantial increase total hospital charge ( p &lt; 0.001 ) versus diagnose dysphagia . There level I study describe successful management complication . Steroids show promise , however , exist concern consequent delay bony fusion . Racemic epinephrine mixture R L isomer epinephrine theoretically result mild side effect profile longer shelf-life versus standard L-epinephrine . Traditionally , racemic epinephrine administer nebulized form treatment severe asthma , laryngeal edema , bronchiolitis . The severe side effect report include tachyarrhythmias paradoxical bronchospasm , although report rare limit mainly single case report case series . It confer therapeutic effect Racemic α-adrenergic β-adrenergic mediate vasoconstriction mucosal vasculature decrease edema respiratory tract , induce bronchodilation . The PI , utilize nebulized racemic epinephrine standard dosage ( 1 unit 0.5 ml 2.25 % racemic epinephrine ) treatment severe post-operative dysphagia patient undergo ACDF 20 year . The investigator achieve marked success intervention notable associate complication . Despite successfully utilized manner many year small pocket spine community , use prophylactic racemic epinephrine management dysphagia describe literature . The investigator hope able fill important knowledge-gap study data .</detailed_description>
