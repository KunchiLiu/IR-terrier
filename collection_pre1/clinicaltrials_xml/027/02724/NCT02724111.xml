	<brief_summary>The investigator aim investigate operating condition , postoperative recovery overall satisfaction surgeon deep neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) group restrict NMB group spinal surgery general anesthesia . The investigator hypothesize study present good surgical condition , postoperative recovery outcomes overall satisfaction surgeon deep NMB group , thereby prove advantage deep NMB well flaws restrict NMB spine surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Group treatment ( Arms ) : group treat restrict neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) ( Group RB ) ; group treat deep NMB ( Group DB ) → randomize allocation ( subject : motor-evoked potential [ MEP ] monitor surgery ) - Inclusion criterion : American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I-II adult , age 18-75 year , schedule elective spinal surgery ( cervical lumbar surgery lesions 3 spinal level monitor MEP ) duration &gt; 1 hour prone position total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) . - Exclusion criterion : Pregnancy , receipt medication know interfere neuromuscular blockade , diseases affect neuromuscular transmission , history hypersensitivity rocuronium sugammadex . The patient hemodynamic instability , mean blood pressure increase fall &gt; 30 % baseline ( last 5min ) , blood loss &gt; 1 L surgery , MEP monitor surgery . - Outcome Measures - Primary outcome : Mean value peak inspiratory pressure record every 15 minute . - Secondary outcome : 1 . The number body movement ( include cough diaphragm movement ) . 2 . The degree bleeding patient scale surgeon ( Intraoperative scale assessment operate condition surgical field : 0 - No bleeding , 1 - Slight bleed - suction blood require , 2 - Slight bleed - occasional suctioning require threaten operative field , 3 ‑ Slight‑bleeding - frequent suction blood require threatens operative field second suction , 4 - Moderate bleeding - frequent suction blood require threatens operative field directly suction , 5 - Sever bleed - continuous suction blood require severely threatened operative field make surgery possible ) . 3 . The muscle tone patient scale surgeon ( 1 : muscle tone good , suitable surgery ; 2 : muscle tone moderate , affect operation ; 3 : muscle tone hard , make operation difficult. ) . - Three time-points assessment muscle tone : ① At placement back muscle retractor open operate site skin subcutaneous incision , ② At screw insertion pedicle spine surgery , ③ At period ( overall muscle tone ) . 4 . Mean value pressure back muscle retractor place operating site ( record every 15 minute ) : measure pressure probe place retractor back muscle . 5 . Overall satisfaction surgeon surgical condition assess surgeon perform surgery use numerical rating scale ( NRS ; 1-10 ) surgery . 6 . Recovery profile include eye opening time , extubation time sedation score ( Observer 's Assessment Alertness/ Sedation ( OAA/S ) score ; awake , 5 unresponsive , 1 ) every 10 min 1 hour postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . 7 . Postoperative adverse event</detailed_description>
