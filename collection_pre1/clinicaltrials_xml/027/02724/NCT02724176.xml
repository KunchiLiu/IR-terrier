	<detailed_description>Thyroid cancer common endocrine malignancy . It estimate 96 % new endocrine organ cancer originate thyroid gland , result approximately 63,000 new case 2014 US1 . Among , papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) common subtype thyroid cancer , account 90 % thyroid cancer . The incidence PTC increase recent year , largely advance early detection ultrasonography fine-needle aspiration biopsy1-4 . The effective treatment PTC complete removal primary tumor metastatic regional lymph node , prerequisite adjuvant therapy . Cervical lymph node metastases quite common PTC report occur 12-81 % patient PTC5 . The common site PTC nodal metastases central neck , report rate lymph node metastases high 50 % ~70 % 5 . Lymph node metastasis area difficult identify preoperatively lymph node typically appear abnormal preoperative imaging6,7 . Routine dissection central neck compartment still controversial due uncertain prognostic value preserve clinically non-apparent lymph node metastasis1,8 , central neck dissection important value ensure accurate clinical stag surgical planning . According previously publish data , prophylactic central dissection suggest improve disease-specific survival decrease local recurrence9,10 well post-treatment thyroglobulin levels9,11 . Neck dissection also inform postoperative treatment , follow-up program , assessment recurrence risk , prognosis12 . However , routine neck dissection controversial uncertain effect prognosis clinically non-apparent lymph node metastasis complication , damage parathyroid gland , hypoparathyroidism , temporary/permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , tracheal esophageal injury , may profoundly influence patient 's qualÂ¬ity life . Methylene blue use detection sentinel lymph node thyroid cancer , methylene blue also stain parathyroid gland , thyroid tissue , fat , make anatomic boundary unclear thereby restrict use methylene blue PTC . As novel lymphatic tracer13,14 , carbon nanoparticles ( CN ) apply successfully detection sentinel lymph node breast gastric cancer , use lymphatic tracer PTC . Thus , investigator hypothesize CN may clinical value thyroid cancer novel lymph node tracer guide central neck dissection . The goal study evaluate whether use CN facilitate detection lymph node , increase number metastatic lymph node remove , accurately reflect metastatic condition central neck , potential protect parathyroid gland . In study , investigator evaluate clinical value CN acquire accurate reflection central neck lymph node status guide central neck dissection .</detailed_description>
