	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Mentor Larger Size MemoryGel Ultra High Profile Breast Implants Subjects Who Are Undergoing Primary Breast Reconstruction Revision Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects , whose body shape suit large size implant currently available , breast reconstruct use UHP-L Breast Implants either first time full mastectomy revision previous breast reconstruction .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject female least 18 year old A candidate : Primary breast reconstruction woman least 18 year old surgically absent breast tissue ( twostage reconstruction [ tissue expanders utilize without use human acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) , limited AlloDerm® FlexHD® PLIABLE , utilized prior surgery expand tissue study device placement ] replace breast tissue postmastectomy ) Revision surgery woman least 18 year old surgically absent breast tissue ( previous reconstruction siliconefilled salinefilled implant revision reconstruction require expansion surgery prior surgery study device implantation , without use human acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) , limited AlloDerm® FlexHD® PLIABLE , utilized prior surgery expand tissue study device placement ) Subject understand sign Informed Consent Subject agree return device Mentor device explanted Subject agrees comply followup procedure , include return followup visit Physician determines implant volume appropriate patient take account subject 's BMI chest width Subject pregnant time enrollment Subject current smoker , smoke within 3 month prior enrollment , plan resume smoke within 3 month postenrollment Currently uncontrolled diabetes ( time screen enrollment ) Has nurse child within 3 month study enrollment Confirmed suspect diagnosis follow rheumatological autoimmune disease immune compromise status : SLE , Sjogren 's syndrome , scleroderma , polymyositis , connective tissue disorder , rheumatoid arthritis , crystalline arthritis , infectious arthritis , spondyloarthropathies , inflammatory arthritis , fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome Currently condition could compromise complicate wound heal . Note , obesity alone exclusion . All surgical risk factor ( obesity , diabetes , smoke history , prior radiation ) consider totality proper subject selection Infection abscess anywhere body Demonstrates tissue characteristic clinically incompatible successful use breast implant ( e.g . inadequate tissue compromise vascularity ) Possesses condition , treatment condition , opinion investigator and/or consult physician ( ) , may constitute unwarranted surgical risk Anatomic physiologic abnormality could lead significant postoperative adverse event Demonstrates characteristic unrealistic/unreasonable risk involve surgical procedure Untreated active , inappropriately/inadequately treat breast malignancy , without surgical treatment Anticipated need use ADM/mesh time implant implant exchange Subject HIV positive Works Mentor study doctor directly relate anyone work Mentor study doctor Implanted metal metal device make MRI scan prohibitive , history claustrophobia condition would make MRI scan prohibitive</criteria>
