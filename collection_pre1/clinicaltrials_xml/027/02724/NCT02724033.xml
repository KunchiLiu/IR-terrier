	<brief_summary>The investigator would like compare therapeutic cost effectiveness establish therapy postoperative nausea vomit regional nerve block head neck area intervention know analgesia antiemetic effect n't entirely explore . The rational base knowledge anatomical innervation inner ear role parasympathetic nervous system emetic act . A lot focus give counterpart sympathetic nervous system role painful condition . The investigator believe nerve blockade parasympathetic innervation beneficial effect post-surgical patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Superficial Cervical Plexus Block Nerve Arnold Block Incidence PONV Inner Ear Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher hypothesize another potential antiemetic mechanism blockade auricular branch vagus nerve ear canal ( commonly describe nerve Arnold ) conjunction block great auricular nerve less occipital nerve superficial cervical plexus level . The block would cover sensory innervation ear canal inner ear . A regional anesthetic block prior surgical intervention inner ear superficial cervical plexus block perform . This latter branch vagus nerve superficial cervical plexus ( erb 's point ) . The block would inhibit vagal afferent area postrema inhibition afferent vagal input medullary center . The emetic act ( vomit ) highly integrated physiologic reflex involve somatic autonomic nervous system . Researchers know much relation vagal nerve branch involvement incidence nausea vomit effect inner ear injury inflammatory response type response trigger area postrema . The usual prophylactic treatment PONV ( post operative nausea vomit ) limit anti-emetics dexamethasone along aggressive fluid therapy adequate analgesia . Investigators propose conduct comparative study therapeutic cost effectiveness regional anesthesia antiemetic therapy prevention treatment PONV child undergo inner ear surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
