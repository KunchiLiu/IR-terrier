	<brief_title>Does International Version ICISS Predict Mortality Patients Admitted With Trauma Four Public University Hospitals Urban India ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Trauma cause 10 % world 's annual death . Trauma-related deaths common low- middle-income country , account 90 % global trauma mortality . In 2013 1.2 million trauma death occur India alone . Hence , India account 25 % trauma-related death worldwide . Experiences high income country show establishment trauma register importance improvement trauma care research , allow comparison different hospital well time . To useful comparison risk-adjusted account difference care patient case mix . In trauma one important patient case mix characteristic adjust injury severity . Several different injury severity score exist purpose . One score International Classification Disease Injury Severity Score ( ICISS ) . In contrast establish score , Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) , ICISS calculate base injury cod use ICD administrative purpose , make cost effective . The validity ICISS primarily study high-income country ICISS require empirically estimate Survival Risk Ratio ( SRR ) ICD code . Some study high income country show similar predictive performance ICISS use SRRs derive high-income country . However , generalisability SRRs low- middle-income country India research . Therefore , aim study validate international version ICISS patient present trauma four public university hospital urban India . Study design Data multi-centre cohort study use . Setting Data Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes ( TITCO ) India project use , conduct four public university hospital urban India . The four centre Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital Mumbai , King Edward Memorial Hospital Mumbai , Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center Delhi , Institute Post-Graduate Medical Education Research Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital Kolkata . Data collect October 2013 September 2015 . Patient data collect one project officer every study center . The project officer work eight hour shift per day , rotate schedule day night shift . All project officer least health science master degree , continuously train supervise project management . Details data collection process publish elsewhere . Source method participant selection Eligible patient identify project officer direct observation emergency room and/or extraction patient record . Data patient admit outside shift collect retrospectively within day . Patients follow discharge , death , 30 day , whichever occur first . Patients transfer hospital consider discharge . Covariates The explanatory variable ICISS . Other covariates include age , sex , mechanism injury , mode transportation transfer status . These covariates use characterise study sample . Data sources/measurements Patient outcomes follow 30 day , death hospital discharge , whichever occur first . Patients discharge alive 30 day consider alive 30 day arrival hospital . ICISS assign base ICD-coding free text injury description , use 10th revision World Health Organization 's International Classification Diseases ( ICD-10 ) . Survival Risk Ratios two publish data set use . One data set SRRs calculate Australian New Zealand population ( 14 ) . The SRRs create pool data Australia , Argentina , Austria , Canada , Denmark , New Zealand Sweden ( 12 ) . Final ICISS patient multiple injury calculate multiply SRRs ICD code assign patient . Bias All patient match selection criterion include study . All data collect patient record examination do hospital personnel association study . The data collector work independently form project manager . The free text injury description extract data set assign ICD-codes data available , include data patient outcome . Study size The sample size require calculate give 80 % power detect substantial difference model performance 1.5 time high low predict survival probability . The calculation base publish recommendation sample size need detect difference external validity prediction model binary outcome . Based recommendation , sample size need include 100 consecutive event , i.e . in-hospital death within 24 hour non-events enrolled period , calculate . In-hospital mortality within 24 hour use sample size calculation power study secondary outcomes well . Quantitative variable All quantitative variable analyse continuous . Statistical method analyse R use statistical analysis . A confidence level 95 % significance level 5 % use . For patient one ICISS calculate two set SRR reference . Henceforth , ICISS base SRR Australia New Zealand denote ICISS-ANZ , ICISS base international SRR derive Gedeborg et al . denote ICISS-I . The performance ICISS-ANZ ICISS-I predict death within 30 day death within 24 hour estimate term discrimination calibration . The area receiver operate characteristic curve ( AUROCC ) use measure discrimination . Calibration assess visually plot observe versus predict outcomes quantified calculate calibration slope . The main analysis complete case analysis patient complete data outcome covariates include . Both ICISS-ANZ ICISS-I base SRR calculate ICD-10 code occur least 20 patient respective derivation dataset . Patients without injury report assigned ICISS 1 . Sensitivity analyse Four sensitivity analysis conduct . The first sensitivity analysis include patient miss data covariates complete outcome data . The second sensitivity analysis exclude patient without reported injury . The third sensitivity analysis include SRR regardless number occurrence original derivation datasets . In final sensitivity analysis ICISS patient base unique ICD-10 code , word , ICD-10 code allow contribute one SRR ICISS even occur patient .</detailed_description>
