	<brief_title>Texas Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration ( TX CORD ) Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal project develop , implement evaluate integrate , systems-oriented obesity model underserved , ethnically diverse child age 2-12 year . The first step include conduct assets-based community assessment low-income neighborhood catchment area Austin Houston , TX input data-sharing exist partnership . Results assessment inform facilitate implementation primary secondary prevention effort across multiple sector ( healthcare , school , childcare ) . The demonstration project include secondary prevention program embed within community primary prevention effort . For primary prevention , quasi-experimental approach use , exist obesity prevention effort reinforce optimize healthcare clinic , Head Start Centers school catchment area ( NOTE : primary prevention intervention study describe ClinicalTrials.gov Texas Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration project Primary Prevention Intervention { TXCORDPRIM ) different protocol &amp; record ) . Secondary prevention include integration investigative team 's evidence-based portfolio family community intervention , specifically MEND/CATCH program . For secondary prevention , randomize control trial design use individual overweight/obese child randomize 12-month community-centered , family-based obesity program primary prevention alone . The hypothesis study among low-income , ethnically diverse overweight obese child , age 2-12 year , system approach child obesity reduce body mass index ( BMI , express % 95th percentile ) compare primary prevention alone . The specific aim grant follow ( see ) . Aim 1 : To implement evaluate efficacy system approach child obesity reduce BMI ( express % 95th percentile ) embed 12-month family-based secondary prevention program within community primary prevention program . The secondary prevention weight management program target overweight/obese child family primary prevention catchment area Austin Houston . Overweight/obese child ( total n=576 ) , age 2-12 year , randomly assign either 12-month secondary prevention program ( experimental ) community primary prevention program alone ( control ) , equal age subgroup ( 2-5 , 6-8 , 9-12 year ) . Analyses conduct age group , outcomes include BMI express % 95th percentile ) , obesity-related behavior , quality life , program use indicator . Aim 2 : To quantify incremental cost-effectiveness 12-month family-based secondary prevention program relative primary prevention alone child obesity . Activity Based Costing method use quantify incremental cost deliver secondary prevention program relative optimize healthcare . These cost combine effectiveness data quantify incremental cost-effectiveness community-based intervention . All project activity coordinate input Demonstration Project Research Network Committee ( CDC Evaluation Center ) .</detailed_description>
