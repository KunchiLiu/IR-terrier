	<detailed_description>This single-blind , two-arm cluster randomise control trial involve 15 hospital psychiatric hospital bed across Finland . Units randomise equal basis receive either staff educational programme ( design together staff member , patient relative study unit ) standard care . Inpatient psychiatric hospital organisation unit randomisation . The cluster design use avoid contamination individual staff member study ward . We use centralized randomisation University Turku ( Department Mathematics Statistics ) . Randomisation fully conceal computer-generated independent statistician , involve study . Investigators enrol ward foresee assignment . Outcome assessor statisticians kept blind allocation . However , due type intervention , allocation unmask patient relative , contact person ward , health care staff deliver patient care ward randomisation ; would reflect real-world care . While Data Monitoring Committee undertook ongoing safety surveillance , investigator run preliminary analysis Data Monitoring Committee mask data investigator release database . Further , statisticians National Register holder responsible Finnish routine data use study , mask ward allocation patient data group . Randomisation do collect baseline data unit . Baseline data coercive practice use unit collect member research team help staff member within eight week , observational interview data relate quality service collect research team ( intervention unit ) . On individual level , staff member work study unit , patient , relative eligible participate study . Staff survey interview staff member , patient group relatives do basis free . The staff unit/research team member approach patient relative explain purpose study arrangement orally write format . The opportunity ask question study give . Those assessed lack capacity give inform consent decline participate interview . Staff survey repeat baseline follow-up . On organisational level , outcomes related patient service use assess 12 month baseline data collection . Assessing quality component : The strength , weakness , opportunity , threat relate new practice also discuss categorise base SWOT analysis ( Strength , Weakness , Opportunity , Threat ) . Possible barrier facilitate factor change unit identify . The quality service facility assess observation unit , base World Health Organization 's ( 2012 ) QualityRight Tool Kit focus five central quality criterion . Power sample size : We systematically search , find directly relevant past work . We may assume 8 % adult patient admit psychiatric hospital coerce stay . We may consider 50 % reduction use coercion method . In order 80 % power 5 % two-sided significance level ( alpha = 0.05 80 % power ) , 20 ward total 1,764 patient would randomise two arm . The patient relate data collect intervention period .</detailed_description>
