A comparison perform two randomized treatment group variable three 12 month . Participants recruit via advertisement local newspaper . Inclusion : Men woman 18-65 year age nonspecific , long term neck pain ( &lt; 3 month ) .Exclusion criterion chronic tension-type headache , migrain , traumatic neck injury , neurologic sign symptom . rheumatic disease , fibromyalgia severe physiologic physical diserases difficulty understand Swedish language . The enrollment participant , randomization procedure performance measurement conduct four independent physiotherapist . Randomization do block 30 accord seal envelope technique . Assessments make treatment ( baseline ) , immediately treatment six 12-month follow-up . All participant answer questionnaire demographic data , pain ( duration intensity ) disability . Pain intensity rat current NP average NP week assessment , measure visual analogue scale ( VAS - measure millimeter end point 0 = pain 100 = unbearable pain ) ( Carlsson , 1983 ) . Neck Movements measure cervico Thorac Ratio ( CTR ) ( Norlander 2995 ) , Disability measure Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) ( Vernon , 1991 ) , consist ten-item , scale questionnaire total score recalculate percent ( 0 % , disability ; 100 % , maximum disability ) . The item assess NP accord intensity , personal care , lift , reading , headache , concentration , work , drive , sleep recreation . Quality Life measure SF-36 questionnaire ( Sullivan1995 ) . Study participants One hundred twenty-two subject long-term , non-specific NP randomize intervention qigong ( n=60 ) exercise therapy ( n=62 ) .

Each training session start warm-up stationary bicycle ten minute , follow 40 minute dynamic exercise . These exercise consist active movement aim cover full range motion neck direction muscle exercise aim maintain/increase circulation , endurance strength . The muscle exercise carry gravity add resistance ( example weight , rubber expander , dumbbells pulley apparatus ) end stretch muscle neck , shoulder upper limb . The amount load individualize keep within pain tolerance ( aim increase pain ) . The load muscle exercise achieve 30 70 % maximum muscle capacity gradually increase endurance strength gain .</detailed_description>
