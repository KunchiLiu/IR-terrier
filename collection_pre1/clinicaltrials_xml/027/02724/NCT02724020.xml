	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy safety single-agent MLN0128 combination MLN0128 + MLN1117 compare everolimus treatment participant metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( mccRCC ) progress vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -targeted therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MLN0128 MLN0128 + MLN1117 Compared With Everolimus Treatment Adults With Advanced Metastatic Clear-Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call MLN0128 MLN1117 . MLN0128 MLN1117 test treat people mccRCC . This study ass efficacy safety MLN0128 MLN1117 well process body participant advance mccRCC . The study enroll approximately 189 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one three treatment group : - Everolimus 10 mg daily ( QD ) - MLN0128 30 mg weekly ( QW ) - MLN0128 4 mg + MLN1117 200 mg QD x 3 day per week All participants ask take study drug time schedule day . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 2 year last participant randomize , last participant discontinues study treatment ( approximately 3 year ) . Participants make multiple visit clinic include follow-up visit 30 40 day receive last dose study drug prior start subsequent anticancer therapy safety assessment . Participants follow Progression Free Overall Survival .</detailed_description>
