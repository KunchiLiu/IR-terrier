	<detailed_description>This feasibility study conduct two part . The first part mainly design investigate feasibility perform ultra-deep sequencing plasma derive circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) individual patient advance solid tumor currently treat immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ICIs ) . Patients ' archival tumor request used whole exome sequencing ( WES ) tumor DNA . Blood sample single time point collect ctDNA analysis germ line DNA analysis ( study normal variant ) use next generation sequence . The second part design prospective research study patient tumor blood sample collect serial time point investigate clonal evolution tumor selection pressure ICIs . Patients image-guided fresh tumor core needle biopsy maximum 3 time point : 1. prior commencement ICIs , 2. disease response therapy confirm standard radiology RECIST 1.1 criterion and/or immune relate response criterion , 3. radiological disease progression therapy confirm RECIST 1.1 criterion . Patients disease response immunotherapy could 3 fresh tumor biopsy ( 3 time point ) respond therapy one biopsy ( 1st time point ) . For patient mandatory treatment biopsy part separate clinical trial ( within receive ICIs ) time point different study , investigator request one extra core tumor material research use within SPECIAL feasible safe judged staff radiologist . Blood sample ctDNA analysis collect commencement treatment every 6-12 week thereafter ideally coincide radiological tumor assessment whenever possible radiological disease progression confirm use RECIST 1.1 criterion . Normal genomic DNA derive peripheral mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) extract one tube whole blood collect baseline study normal variant . Blood sample study change immune cell repertoire immune relate amino acid , peptide , proteins metabolite peripheral circulation collect baseline , 6-12 week start treatment coincide 1st radiological tumor assessment time radiological disease progression . Imaging parameter radiomic image analysis derive patient ' routine CT scan . Fresh tumor biopsy use genomic profiling study tumor ' mutation spectrum WES level gene expression . PBMC DNA analyse WES study normal variant . Mutation profile ctDNA perform use next generation DNA sequencing approach . Genomic data derive tumor , ctDNA PBMC DNA analysis use explore tumor clonal architecture study clonal selection tumor evolution selection pressure induce ICIs immunological therapy . Changes radiomic image signature treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor correlation genomic signature also examine . Using blood sample collect baseline , time 1st radiological tumor assessment time disease progression , dynamic change immune cell repertoire immune relate amino acid , peptide , proteins metabolite peripheral circulation patient treatment ICIs also explore .</detailed_description>
