	<detailed_description>Dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represent standard care treatment prevention major adverse cardiovascular event patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Currently , 3 oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitor ( clopidogrel , prasugrel , ticagrelor ) available clinical use . Clopidogrel remain broadly use P2Y12 receptor inhibitor . However , well establish clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effect suboptimal many patient thus expose increase risk adverse cardiovascular event . Studies show genotype cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C19 enzyme , key determinant clopidogrel metabolism , contribute finding . In fact , clopidogrel prodrug require bioactivation CYP2C19 enzyme . Approximately 30-40 % individual loss-of-function ( LOF ) CYP2C19 genotype sufficiently convert clopidogrel active form , thereby gain little benefit drug . Prasugrel ticagrelor alternative agent whose effectiveness dependent CYP2C19 genotype . A boxed warning Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved clopidogrel labeling warns reduce effectiveness patient LOF genotype recommend alternative therapy patient . Guidelines Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium ( CPIC ) specifically recommend prasugrel ticagrelor clopidogrel patient LOF CYP2C19 genotype undergo PCI . In turn , recommendation lead use clinical practice genetic test CYP2C19 genotype aid clinician determine therapeutic strategy patient undergo PCI . However , uptake genetic test real-world clinical practice limit availability assay able provide genetic result timely fashion . The availability assay recently approve FDA , SpartanRX , provide result within one-hour facilitates perform genetic test clinical test real-world practice . We therefore propose 1 ) examine feasibility implement CYP2C19 genotyping use SpartanRX standard care patient undergoing cardiac catheterization UF Health Jacksonville provide opportunity clinician embrace genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy proceed PCI 2 ) determine CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy reduces risk major adverse cardiovascular outcome PCI .</detailed_description>
