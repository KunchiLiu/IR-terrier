	<brief_summary>The study ass effectiveness , safety clinical outcome Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device treatment aortic disease affect aortic arch descend thoracic aorta , without involvement ascend aorta . The study also assess safety early clinical outcome patient receive extension procedure within 1 year Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device implantation . Lastly study assess safety clinical outcome patient receive Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device treatment rupture aorta . Patients follow 3 year . The Primary Endpoint freedom define Major Adverse Events ( MAE ) occur ≤ 1 year post-procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vascutek Ltd develop Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device ( Plexus™ 4 Ante-Flo™ ) open surgical repair replacement damage diseased vessel aortic arch descend aorta , without involvement ascend aorta , case aneurysm and/or dissection . The Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device may consider development Elephant Trunk ( ET ) graft addition stented distal section . In case allow single stage procedure carry , dependent length affect vessel . As device fully seal collar aid anastomosis , remove requirement situ seal suture together two device , thereby reduce cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) time overall procedure time . By reduce procedure time negate need many subsequent procedure , method could greatly improve success procedure may improve patient outcomes . The ability treat complex anatomy addition reduce procedure CPB time , justify investigation Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device . Safety effectiveness data subject treat Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device compare historical data subject treat use standard ET surgical repair . It anticipate 83 patient recruit 14 month period ( approximately ) . Patients evaluate following time point : Pre-procedure , Implant , Discharge/30 day , 3 month , 12 month , 24 month 36 month . An additional visit may perform patient undergo extension procedure within 1 year Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device implantation . 65 patient recruit primary study group ( maximum 12 per site ) . An additional group patient rupture aorta may also recruit ( approximately 18 patient across site ) . A historical control population derive comparable patient population receive treatment thoracic aortic disease use current standard care , conventional ( 2-stage ) elephant trunk technique . Using data comparator population Performance Goal Target set 57.4 % . The study deem success lower limit 95 % confidence interval , associate proportion study patient free define composite Major Adverse Events ( permanent stroke , permanent paraplegia/paraparesis , unanticipated aortic relate re-operation all-cause mortality ) 1 year post procedure , great 57.4 % . Only patient include main study group include Performance Goal Analysis ; patient recruit additional Aortic Rupture group include primary endpoint analysis . All patient main study group include analysis regardless whether extension procedure perform .</detailed_description>

Patients acute dissection aorta : •Patient acute aortic dissection require repair replacement damage diseased vessel aortic arch ( without involvement ascend aorta ) , descend aorta require replacement , , opinion investigator , patient would derive clinical benefit prophylactic treatment descend aorta . B . Patients chronic dissection aorta : •Patient require repair replacement damage diseased vessel aortic arch descend aorta without involvement ascend aorta due chronic dissection . And patient satisfies one follow criterion : Patient aortic sinus , ascend aorta , aortic arch , descend aorta diameter ≥5.5cm ( include asymptomatic ) Patient aorta diameter &lt; 5.5cm growth rate ≥0.5cm/year ( include asymptomatic ) Patient ascend aorta diameter ≥4.5cm require valve repair replacement C. Patients aortic aneurysm ( include connective tissue disorder ) : •Patient require repair replacement damage diseased vessel aortic arch descend aorta without involvement ascend aorta And patient satisfies one follow criterion : Patient aortic sinus , ascend aorta , aortic arch , descend aorta diameter ≥5.5cm ( include asymptomatic ) Patient aorta diameter &lt; 5.5cm growth rate ≥0.5cm/year ( include asymptomatic ) Patient ascend aorta diameter ≥4.5cm require valve repair replacement Patient Marfan syndrome genetically mediate disorder aortic sinus , ascend aorta , arch diameter ≥4.5cm , , ratio maximal ascend aortic root area ( Π r2 ) cm2 divide patient 's height meter exceed 10 Inclusion criterion Patients Ruptured Aorta : Patient age 18 year , date consent Patient legally authorize representative able willing give consent patient 's enrolment study Patient either rupture thoracic aorta , , experience treating surgeon , high risk imminent rupture thoracic aorta Main Study Group ( All Patients Except Patients Ruptured Aorta ) Patient unfit open surgical repair involve circulatory arrest Patient know sensitivity polyester , nitinol material bovine origin Patient rupture aorta Patient active endocarditis active infective disorder aorta Patient active systemic infection , opinion investigator , would compromise outcome surgical procedure Patient enrol another active study receive investigational product ( device , pharmaceutical biologic ) within 6 month prior date implant reach primary endpoint study Patient female pregnant , plan become pregnant course study .
