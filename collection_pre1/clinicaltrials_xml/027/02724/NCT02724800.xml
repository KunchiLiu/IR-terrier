	<brief_title>Implementation Brief Insomnia Treatments - Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Insomnia ( CBTI ) evidence-based first line treatment chronic insomnia . Randomized controlled trial meta-analyses establish CBTI efficacious effective . Despite strong evidence CBTI , chronic insomnia remain under-treated among Veterans several barrier limit access behavioral treatment . In recent year , VA take substantial measure train clinician provide insomnia treatment ; however , deficit treatment availability remain . In 2011 , VA begin train clinician CBTI part VA 's Evidence Based Psychotherapy ( EBP ) training program , goal train 1000 clinician . Even 1000 VA clinician train CBTI , shortage clinician likely remain due high prevalence insomnia . High prevalence shortage clinician prevent VA meeting care demand Veterans insomnia . While CBTI roll-out significant investment VA , additional mechanism , dissemination implementation evidence-based treatment insomnia few implementation barrier , must consider address high prevalence insomnia . The in-person delivery length treatment CBTI may one barrier access care . Briefer protocols use multiple delivery modality recently develop may help increase session attendance treatment completion . These short insomnia treatment often refer Brief Behavioral Treatment Insomnia ( BBTI ) consist ≤4 session . Besides few briefer session , utilize in-person phone delivery treatment , BBTI also emphasize behavioral component CBTI ( i.e. , stimulus control sleep restriction ) rather combine approach focus behavioral cognitive component . BBTI efficacious adults—studies older adult Veterans find BBTI result significant decrease insomnia severity Cohen 's effect size moderate large range . Like CBTI , BBTI significantly improve insomnia severity may also help improve secondary outcome like depression anxiety . Integration new insomnia treatment , like BBTI , first depend establish evidence directly compare CBTI . Effectiveness trial BBTI , especially conduct military Veterans typical VA setting , yet conduct . Before BBTI broadly implement integrated VA , need establish clinically effective treatment insomnia among Veterans statistically non-inferior treatment ( necessarily well bad ) Veterans compare CBTI .</detailed_description>
