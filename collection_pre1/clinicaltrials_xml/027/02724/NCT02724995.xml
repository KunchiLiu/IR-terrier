	<brief_summary>This study help investigator understand pathogenesis different rare genetic condition establish database rare genetic database . This would ultimately help provide accurate diagnosis advance genomic diagnostic testing database establish study . This knowledge would turn help clinical management affect family member individual affect similar condition . Understanding pathogenesis disease would also enable investigator develop target therapy rare genetic disease , also collaborate target therapy-related clinical trial . The investigator plan store result study database . These result share researcher doctor , research , diagnose treat individual similar disease . The investigator share data collect biological sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This propose study design identify genetic cause rare disease . This study involve use investigational medication device . No randomization take place . Participants enrol study ask provide blood saliva sample DNA test . Samples collect one two method ; - If participant clinical genetic test perform , results/data collect University Kentucky ( UK ) clinical molecular pathology laboratory medical record . If cause disease identify clinical genetic testing , investigator reanalyze clinical genetic test data use blood saliva sample leftover clinical genetic test additional experiment use new method identify cause disease . - If sample leftover clinical genetic testing available , investigator plan collect 2 teaspoon blood saliva participant first visit site . This study plan enroll 1000 participant University Kentucky Medical Center . The investigator plan store blood saliva DNA sample collect future research study involve rare genetic disease . The stored blood saliva DNA sample release anyone outside study . Stored sample label unique study identifier maintain investigator 's research laboratory locate University Kentucky , Department Pathology Laboratory Medicine , 800 Rose Street , Lexington , KY 40536 . There limit length time sample store . The investigator may keep use stored sample indefinitely unless participant decide withdraw project . Participants may withdraw cancel permission use store sample time . However , sample health information already obtain use destroy . There additional cost charge participant allow investigator store use leave blood saliva sample benefit participant allow investigator store sample . Participants pay donate sample . The sample information participant donate long belong . The research may lead new medical knowledge , test , treatment product . These product could financial value . There plan provide financial payment either participant relative occur .</detailed_description>
