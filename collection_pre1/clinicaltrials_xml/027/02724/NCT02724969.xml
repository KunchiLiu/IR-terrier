	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot randomize trial determine effectiveness , feasibility , acceptability mobile , semi-automated text message-based intervention ( MILK ) prevent perceive low insufficient milk supply ( PIM ) population mother without prior breastfeeding experience . PIM lead cause premature breastfeed cessation , prior work show often root low breastfeed self-efficacy misconception lactation physiology trajectory . The MILK intervention design address PIM , well common breastfeed problem via semi-automated text message prenatal postpartum breastfeed education support . Messages time-sensitive ( e.g. , specific gestational age , time since delivery ) base Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy ( Social Cognitive ) Theory ; also model pilot work investigate first-time mother view , manage describe breastfeed problem . Messages vet expert clinical lactation , well pregnant postpartum woman child . The MILK intervention trialed control intervention group , receive general perinatal education national Text4Baby system . The investigator recruit approximately 115 healthy , pregnant woman 13-25 week gestation Magee Women 's Hospital clinic outpatient site . Women randomize via computer-generated simple randomization experimental control intervention . Both group receive text message 3-5 time per week week 25 pregnancy week 8 postpartum . Measured outcomes interest include perceive breast milk supply , breastfeed confidence , maternal anxiety , breastfeed exclusivity , breastfeed duration . Data collect baseline ( 13-25 gestational week ) , 34-36 gestational week , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 week postpartum via online survey ( Qualtrics ) telephone call . To assess potential longer-term impact intervention , breastfeed continuation exclusivity reassess via telephone 6 month postpartum . Between group group x time difference outcome measure examine graphically via linear mixed modeling . To inform modification MILK , telephone interview conduct subset participant group ass compare intervention use , burden challenge , suggest alteration ( 8 week ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose MILK Trial examine compare effectiveness , feasibility , acceptability semi-automated , text-based , theory-driven intervention ( `` MILK '' intervention ) prevent perceive insufficient milk potential inter-related sequela , include maternal anxiety early breastfeeding cessation , among mother without breastfeed experience intend exclusively nearly exclusively breastfeed . Specifically , investigator : 1 . Determine effect MILK intervention perceive insufficient milk supply ( PIM ) relate maternal psychological behavioral sequela . Compared control intervention group ( `` Text4Baby '' ) , investigator hypothesize MILK participant perception great breast milk volume/supply , high self-reported breastfeeding confidence , low anxiety score , long duration exclusive breastfeeding . 2 . Assess feasibility semi-automated text-based PIM intervention ( MILK ) mother . The investigator compare characteristic woman eligible , chose participate , complete randomize pilot intervention study . The investigator also conduct post-study individual interview mother determine intervention use perceive ( e.g. , burden , challenge ) .</detailed_description>
