	<brief_summary>This first three plan phase design evaluate feasibility tolerability TubeClear® restore patency occlude Pediatric Enteral Access Devices . Based preliminary data obtain phase study , subsequent phase continue evaluate feasibility tolerability ( Phase IIA ) ultimately compare efficacy TubeClear® Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) Standard Treatment restore patency occlude Pediatric Enteral Access Devices ( EAD ) ( Phase IIB ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TubeClear® Evaluation Pediatric Patients ( Phase I )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Occluded enteral access device ( EADs ) significant problem pediatric patient , occlusion rate range 12.5 % 35 % . Occluded EADs lead extend time decreased energy intake , result patient quickly exhaust energy reserve develop dehydration electrolyte abnormality . Current method use restore patency occlude EAD The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) involve application enzyme chemical ( e.g. , Clog Zapper ) , variable rate timely success . If method unsuccessful patency restore , EAD must replace may require radiological intervention exposure radiation contrast material . TubeClear® address clinical need safely efficaciously restore patency occlude EADs patient ' bedside EAD remain patient . Additionally , reduces need transport patient radiology suite subsequent exposure radiation contrast material EAD location conformation replacement . Current Study ( Phase I ) : Feasibility tolerability TubeClear® intervention 10 consecutive eligible Subjects occlude Enteral Access Devices eight ( 8 ) year age attain 18th birthday . Following successful completion Phase I deem Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , Study proceed Phase IIA IIB run concurrently . Future Studies : Phase IIA : Ability TubeClear® intervention restore patency 20 consecutive eligible Subjects occlude Enteral Access Devices eight ( 8 ) year age attain 11th birthday . Phase IIB : Randomized efficacy comparison 17 subject use TubeClear® intervention 17 subject use CHOP Standard Treatment eligible Subjects occlude Enteral Access Devices 11 year age attain 18th birthday .</detailed_description>
