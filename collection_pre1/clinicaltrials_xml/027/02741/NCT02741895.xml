	<brief_title>Using Fitbit Monitor Ambulation Patients After Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After patient awake alert surgery , study team member place Fitbit device participant ' wrist . Investigators monitor daily step take active minute duration hospitalization , option discontinue clinically require request patient provider . Investigators record wearable biosensor number subject study number secure spreadsheet . To supplement Fitbit data , research coordinator collect clinical data chart review electronic health record ( age , gender , race/ethnicity , body mass index , comorbid health condition ) , enter data secure spreadsheet . Physicians also participate study provide data estimate daily ambulation , use standard format scale . Surgeons currently assess daily ambulation medical record , assessment uniform , precludes meaningful comparison provider . Investigators therefore ask physician record daily estimate ambulatory status accord standardize term commonly use medical record ( nonambulatory ; bed chair ; bed ambulate ( QD , BID , TID ) ; ambulate ad lib ) . Investigators also collect information daily ambulation order enter provider team part routine practice . This information ascertain chart review enter secure spreadsheet along additional patient data . The Fitbit device battery life approximately 7 day , investigator plan recharge download information every 5 day . At time discharge , study team member remove device download information device secure spreadsheet . The wearable biosensor reset time information erase memory . Investigators also clean wearable biosensors disinfectant use durable medical equipment . Investigators also query medical record information regard disposition outcome , include length stay ( end surgery discharge hospital ) location disposition ( home , rehab facility , skilled nursing facility ) . Investigators contact patient phone 30 day elapse since discharge inquire whether readmitted hospital ER within 30 day discharge date .</detailed_description>
