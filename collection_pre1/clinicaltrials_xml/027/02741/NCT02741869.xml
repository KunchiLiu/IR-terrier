	<detailed_description>This medical research study eliminate Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) ( decolonization ) nares patient colonized organism . Bacterial colonization anterior naris ( inside nose ) believe play important role development infection central venous catheter , line use hemodialysis , subsequent bloodstream infection . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) show lethal class microorganism : Gram-positive , Gram-negative bacteria , fungi ( fungus ) , virus , parasite even spore . In addition antimicrobial effect PDT also demonstrate anti-inflammatory effect . The objective study evaluate efficacy PDT nasal decolonization S. aureus hemodialysis patient</detailed_description>
