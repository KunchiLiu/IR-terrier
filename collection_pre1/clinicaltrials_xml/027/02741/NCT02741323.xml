	<brief_title>Impact CCR5 Blockade HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MVC CCR5 inhibitor may positive role modulate immune response follow transplantation . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability MVC HIV-infected adult need kidney transplant . The study also evaluate whether use immunosuppressant drug MVC improve kidney function kidney transplant . This study enroll HIV-infected adult combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) need kidney transplant . At time kidney transplant , study participant randomly assign receive either MVC placebo addition cART regimen . ( MVC placebo provide study . However , HIV medicine cART regimen provide study . ) Participants receive MVC placebo throughout participation study , 1 3 year depend enroll study . Study visit occur enrollment ( Day 0 ) post-transplant Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 13 , 26 , 39 , 52 , 78 , 104 , 130 , 156 . Study visit may include physical examination , blood collection , lymph node collection , urine sample collection , kidney biopsy . During study , participant also monitor closely evidence drug toxicity , HIV treatment failure rejection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant able understand provide inform consent . Documented HIV infection ( license enzymelinked immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ] confirmation Western Blot , positive HIV antibody ( ab ) indirect fluorescent antibody ( IFA ) , document history detectable HIV1 RNA ) . Participant 18 year age old . CD4+ Tcell count great equal 200/ÂµL time 16 week prior enrollment . Most recent HIV1 RNA le 50 copy RNA/mL . Eligibility time enrollment determine base recent HIV1 RNA , 16 week prior enrollment . Subjects require switch combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) regimen become study eligible must also eligible HIV1 RNA result least 4 week post change cART . Participant meet standard list criterion placement transplant wait list . For participant HIV+ decease donor : No active opportunistic infection . Concurrence study team base medical history ART , viral suppression achieve recipient posttransplant . Must enrol Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve research protocol fulfill requirement DHHA Hope Act Policy ( see protocol information ) . HIV+ decease donor must evidence invasive opportunistic complication HIV infection , must preimplant biopsy . Antiretroviral ( ARV ) Use : Participant stable cART regimen least 3 month prior enrollment ( unless change make due toxicity , drug interaction , convenience eligible integrase inhibitorbased regimen ) . Switch due virologic failure . If nonintegrase inhibitor base regimen , participant must switch integrase inhibitorbased regimen base lack prior drug resistance antiretroviraltreatment failure , willing remain indefinitely unless change medically necessary . Participants need switch must stable cART regimen least 3 month prior , must new integrase inhibitorbased regimen least 4 week prior entry . Subjects require switch cART regimen become study eligible must also eligible HIV1 RNA result least 4 week post change cART ( 16 week prior transplant ) . If already stable regimen 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) integrase inhibitor , participant willing remain regimen indefinitely unless change regimen medically indicate . If untreated , must initiate willing remain indefinitely antiretroviral regimen two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) integrase inhibitor unless change medically necessary . No known allergy intolerance component maraviroc ( MVC ) formulation . No known contraindication MCV . Female participant childbearing potential must negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) pregnancy test within 30 day randomization . Participant currently MVC . Participant need multiorgan transplant . Participant live donor HIV+ . Participant unable switch integrase inhibitorbased cART regimen . Participant receive immunosuppressant medication 6 month prior enrollment . Note : Low dose maintenance steroid ( less equal 10 mg per day prednisone , equivalent strength steroid ) consider immunosuppression . Opportunistic Complication History : Any history progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis great 1 month duration , primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma . Note : History pulmonary coccidiodomycosis treat per local site policy regard infection HIV negative transplant candidate , generally require 5year diseasefree interval . Participant history neoplasm except follow : resolve kaposi 's sarcoma , situ anogenital carcinoma , adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , solid tumor ( except primary CNS lymphoma ) treat curative therapy disease free 5 year . History renal cell carcinoma require diseasefree state 2 year . History leukemia diseasefree duration per site policy . Substance use opinion investigator would interfere compliance study requirement . Participant pregnant breastfeeding . Note : Participants become pregnant posttransplant continue follow study manage per local site practice . Women become pregnant breastfeed . Participant use interleukin2 ( IL2 ) granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor ( GMCSF ) prior six month . Participant receive interferonalpha therapy prior 12 week . Use investigational drug within 4 week enrollment . Past current medical problem finding medical history , physical examination , laboratory testing list , , opinion investigator , may pose additional risk participation study , may interfere participant 's ability comply study requirement , may impact quality interpretation data obtain study .</criteria>
