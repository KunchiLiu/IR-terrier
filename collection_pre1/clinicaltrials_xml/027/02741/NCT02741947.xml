	<detailed_description>The trial experimental two-centers , randomize , double-blind , two-sequence , non-inferiority cross-over study . Population : out-patients diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) least 5 year , receive Levodopa , enrol participate study . The study perform hospital setting use facility clinical trial centre sit involve study . The patient recruit within patient population use hospital out-patients clinic . Recruitment timing last 18 month . Screened subject agree participate study , take Levodopa/Benserazide LDB ( Madopar® ) enter 4 week period stable regimen Madopar® ( run-in period ) . The formulation levodopa admit trial : Madopar® 100+25 ; 200+50 ( 1/2 1 tablet ) . Following run-in period , two key phase study : two maintenance period ( 4 week ) , total duration 8 week . Patients assign randomly ( 1:1 ) computerize randomization system one two formulation sequence maintain dose stabilized run : - generic-originator - originator-generic At end maintenance period 1 , patient formulation group underwent overnight switch dose alternative formulation . The dose kept stable whole length trial . Clinical evaluation perform end period ( see flow chart enclose ) . The tablet encapsulate maintain blindness . A pharmacokinetic study fix dose ( 100+25 mg ) perform sub-population 14 subject . The drug administer orally . In case prolong , tolerable akinetic period study , patient could rescue extra dose levodopa . Any antiparkinsonian treatment modification supplementation antiparkinsonian drug allow study . Any drug specific Parkinson 's disease evaluate investigator allow necessary interfering study drug . The random allocation patient one two treatment group centrally manage coordinate centre , accord automatically generate randomization list provide team responsible data collection monitoring statistical analysis . An allocation ratio 1:1 assume generate list . Patients eligible enter randomization procedure sequentially assign low randomization sequence number yet assign study subject . For randomization number , seal envelope contain randomization code prepare team generate randomization list . Unblinding permit strictly necessary . In case essential know treatment assign patient due serious unexpected adverse event , envelope contain patient 's randomization code could open . In case , detailed report timing , cause patient 's randomization number would issue person responsible trial archive coordinate centre . Mechanical blinding ( encapsulation ) use ensure double-blind nature study . Because patient enrolled trial receive levodopa/benserazide different dos , over-encapsulation tablet permit blind oral dosage form : ½ tablet , several small tablet , capsule different sizes color . Each capsule place narrow opaque tube identify `` Treatment 1 '' `` Treatment 2 '' administration patient . The patient , investigator , Medical Monitor Clinical Monitor remain blind , whereas site pharmacist nurse administer study medication blind throughout part study . No interim analysis plan protocol . Amendments : amendment present study .</detailed_description>
