	<detailed_description>3.1 STUDY DESIGN Children uncomplicated malaria meet inclusion criterion enrol ( parent/caretaker give informed consent ) , treat site drug evaluation followed-up period 42 day . Drugs give direct supervision , either clinic home . Follow-up shall consist fixed schedule clinical laboratory examination . Based clinical laboratory finding , child classify therapeutic failure ( early late ) adequate responder . The proportion case experience vivo therapeutic failure follow-up period provide estimate efficacy drug regimen . A Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) analysis carry differentiate true recrudescence due treatment failure episodes re-infection . This proposal compliant late WHO recommendations anti-malarial efficacy monitoring high , medium low transmission zones11 . 3.2 STUDY SITES The study site MSF catchment area Baraka health centre , MSF-OCA Baraka , South Kivu , DRC . 3.3 STUDY POPULATION The study population child age 6 59 month uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . This age group select consider vulnerable less likely clear infection spontaneously compare old child adult . In hyper-endemic area , risk die malaria . 3.4 DEFINITIONS 3.4.1 DEFINITION OF PARENT/CARETAKER The parent/caretaker define household member age ≥ 18 year care patient give accurate information demographic health issue relate patient present time survey . 3.5 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA A child eligible study participation s/he meet follow inclusion criterion : - Age 6 59 month - Weight ≥ 5 Kg - Slide-confirmed infection Plasmodium falciparum ( mixed infection ) - Asexual parasite density 2000 200000/µl blood - Measured axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C - Ability swallow oral medication - High probability respect follow-up visit ( residence within 1 hour walk distance OPD , upcoming travel plan , etc . ) - Informed consent parent caretaker age least 18 year . A child exclude study participation s/he meet follow exclusion criterion : - General danger sign accord WHO definition ( Appendix 5.1.1 ) - Signs severe/complicated malaria accord WHO definition ( Appendix 5.1.2 ) - Severe anaemia ( haemoglobin &lt; 5 g/dL ) - Known history hypersensitivity study drug - Severe acute malnutrition ( define weight-for-height -3 Z-score and/or symmetrical oedema involve least foot ) - Concomitant febrile illness due cause malaria potential confound study outcome ( measles , acute low tract respiratory infection , otitis medium , tonsillitis , abscess , severe diarrhoea dehydration ) . - Having receive already full course treatment ( one treatment ) study previous 28 day ( indicated parent/caretaker ) . Note previous incomplete anti-malarial intake treatment study , previous intake anti-malarials study , exclusion criterion , detail intake record carefully . - History hypersensitivity reaction contra-indications medicine test . 3.6 SAMPLE SIZE Recent study determine 42-day risk recurrent parasitaemia due recrudenscence ( treatment failure ) child range 0.9-6 % Coartem® therapy14 ; 17 ; 21 ; 22 . Therefore basis conservative estimate risk recurrent parasitaemia ( due recrudescence , PCR correct ) 5 % , calculate 120 patient per treatment arm would need detect difference risk recurrent parasitaemia treatment arm great 7 % ( one-sided type I error 5 % , 80 % power ) 23 . Assuming re-infections , undetermined PCR result loss follow-up occur 20 % sample , total estimate sample size study 288 child age 6-59 month ( 144 per arm ) . 3.7 SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS Day 0 day screen clinical assessment , initial malaria blood smear , first haemoglobin measurement , pre-treatment capillary blood sample PCR , enrolment administration first dose drug study . On Day 1 Day 2 , treatment continue child re-assessed MSF clinic . Children return clinic follow mandatory day : Day 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 42 . At scheduled visit , clinical examination blood smear perform . To encourage clinic attendance , small incentive offer soap , blanket travel reimbursement . All child recruit study receive long-lasting insecticide-treated bednet . If child return clinic unscheduled visit , time clinical laboratory exam conduct need . In case treatment failure day day 7 , capillary blood sample PCR collect . 3.8 STUDY END POINTS A study endpoint point patient long followed-up within context efficacy study . Valid study endpoint include treatment failure , completion follow-up period without treatment failure , loss follow-up , withdrawal study ( voluntary involuntary ) protocol violation11 . 3.8.1 EARLY TREATMENT FAILURE ( ETF ) - Development danger sign severe malaria Day 1 , Day 2 Day 3 presence parasitaemia , - Parasitaemia Day 2 high Day 0 count irrespective axillary temperature , - Parasitaemia Day 3 axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C , - Parasitaemia Day 3 ≥ 25 % day 0 count irrespective axillary temperature . 3.8.2 LATE CLINICAL FAILURE ( LCF ) - Development danger sign severe malaria day Day 4 Day 42 presence parasitaemia ( without previously meet criterion ETF ) , - Presence parasitaemia axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C day Day 4 Day 42 ( without previously meet criterion ETF ) 3.8.3 LATE PARASITOLOGICAL FAILURE ( LPF ) - Presence parasitaemia axillary temperature &lt; 37.5°C day Day 7 Day 42 ( without previously meet criterion ETF LCF ) 3.8.4 ADEQUATE CLINICAL AND PARASITOLOGICAL RESPONSE ( ACPR ) - Absence parasitaemia Day 42 irrespective axillary temperature ( without previously meet criterion ETF , LCF LPF ) 3.8.5 NON ANALYSABLE ENDPOINTS A patient 's endpoint analysable s/he meet follow criterion enrolment study . In non-inferiority study , Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis often increase risk falsely claim non-inferiority ( type I error ) carry here24 . 3.8.5.1 Protocol violation : - Failure complete full study treatment regimen , due vomiting , - Erroneous enrolment patient ( inclusion/exclusion criterion respect ) , - Intake anti-malarials antibiotic anti-malarial activity ( cotrimoxazole , tetracycline except eye ointment , doxycycline , erythromycin , clindamycin , azithromycin ) administer third party self-medication , - Misclassification patient 's endpoint ( due laboratory clinical error ) lead unjustified administration rescue treatment , - LCF LPF miss undetermined PCR result . 3.8.5.2 Withdrawal : - Severe malaria occur Day 0 enrolment , - Detection ( mixed mono- ) infection non-falciparum specie , - Vomiting study dose , - Side effect study drug severe enough require discontinuation treatment , - Hospitalisation reason malaria , render normal follow-up visit impossible . - Withdrawal consent 3.8.6 SAFETY ENDPOINTS The occurrence adverse event document . All patient ask routinely previous symptom symptom emerge since previous follow-up visit . When clinically indicate , patient evaluate treated appropriately . All serious adverse event record case report form . 3.9 STUDY TREATMENTS 3.9.1 REGIMENS TESTED - Artesunate-amodiaquine fix dose combination , ASAQ FDC ( artesunate-amodiaquine Winthrop® Sanofi Aventis ) give 1 tablet/day 3 day : - Artesunate 25mg / amodiaquine 67.5mg : child 5 8.9kg - Artesunate 50mg / amodiaquine 135mg : 1 tab/day child 9 17.9kg - Artesunate 100mg / amodiaquine 270mg : 1 tab/day child 18 34.9kg - Artemether 20mg / lumefantrine 120mg co-formulated tablet ( Coartem® , Novartis ) give six twice-daily dos three day : - 1 tab/dose child 5 14.9kg ( total 6 tab ) - 2 tabs/dose child 15 24.9kg ( total 12 tab ) - 2 tabs/dose weight 15-24.9kg ( total 12 tab ) - 3 tabs/dose weight 25-34.9 Kg ( total 18 tab ) The second dose Coartem® give 8 hour ( h ) first dose , give enrolment . The following dos give 24h , 36h , 48h 60h first dose . Patients give glass milk fatty food , encourage breastfeed dose take . Drugs study come batch . All study dos supervise . Patients directly observe follow intake 30 minute . If vomiting occurs , repeat dose administer . If repeat dose also vomit , child withdrawn study , rescue treatment initiate . In order administer even dos Coartem® , home visitor/village health worker go patient 's home 8h , 32h 56h first dose . Thus recruitment study take place OPD 12pm 3.9.2 CONCOMITANT TREATMENT Fever 38°C treat paracetamol acetaminophen , one dose 20 mg/kg paracetamol , follow 15 mg/kg 4 6 hourly interval home treatment . Tepid sponge use reduce fever drug intake . Adverse event require treatment treat accord local prac¬tice . If clinical indication additional medication course study , include medication give treat adverse event relate study medicine , name medicine , dosage date time administration must record case report form . Additional prescription may give enrolment follow-up condition malaria , although antibiotic anti-malarial activity ( cotrimoxazole , tetracycline except eye ointment , doxycycline , erythromycin , clindamycin , azithromycin ) prescribe unless equally effective alternative available . Any prescription note carefully . The use herbal remedy study avoid , partici¬pants encourage return study site treatment feel unwell . If herbal remedy take study , capture case report form , 'study medication administration ' . Haematinics ( like ferrous sulphate folic acid ) prescribe ameliorate anaemia accord WHO25 necessary . 3.9.3 RESCUE TREATMENT Rescue treatment malaria shall initiate immediately accord WHO guidelines25 follow case : - Progression severe malaria Day 0 enrolment - Vomiting study dose - Early treatment failure - Late clinical failure - Late parasitological failure - Detection follow-up non-P. falciparum ( mixed mono- ) infection , irrespective fever Rescue treatment shall consist six-dose Coartem® 3 day child receive ASAQ study-treatment ASAQ child receive Coartem® study-treatment . - In case severe malaria , rescue treatment intravenous artesunate dose 2.4 mg/kg 0 , 12 24 hour , every 24 hrs patient take oral therapy ( This follow 3-days full course ACT ) Non-falciparum specie detect follow treat Chloroquine 3 day case infection P. vivax P. ovale . Once rescue treatment initiate , normal study follow-up end patient , endpoint reach . However , patient receive rescue treatment ask return study clinic least , study team verify whether treatment effective . 3.10 STUDY PROCEDURE 3.10.1 SCREENING AND ENROLMENT ( DAY 0 ) All child age 6 59 month present Baraka Health clinic fever history fever positive RDT danger sign ( Appendix 5.1.1 ) send study clinic screening . All patient enter screen process assign consecutive screening number . The screening form ( Appendix 5.2 ) use record general information clinical observation patient screen . Each patient assess danger sign sign severe malaria . Middle-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) use screen tool malnutrition . An initial clinical assessment do include inclusion exclusion criterion , previous treatment history ( include ingestion anti-malarial drug ) , clinical examination weight-for-height child MUAC &lt; 125 mm . Care take detect early sign febrile disease malaria , presence necessitate exclusion study . These patient enrol treated malaria ( parasitaemia ) infection , appropriate . If patient meet clinical inclusion criterion , s/he examine blood inclusion criterion ( P. Falciparum mono-infection , parasite density haemoglobin level ) . Thick thin malaria smear take slide duplicate one smear stain . At time , capillary blood sample take Fast Technology Analysis ( nucleic acid ) FTA Cards PCR analysis . The patient wait thick smear result . If inclusion criterion meet , patient invite enrol study . The study purpose explain parent/caretaker must age 18 year write informed consent request ( Appendix 5.4 ) . All parents/caretakers receive information sheet contain study purpose study team contact detail ( Appendix 0 ) . If parent/caretaker consent include child study , unique patient identification number assign child wrist band identification number give . Administrative data record ( name child parent/caretaker , gender , age , address direction ) Case Record Form ( Appendix 5.5 ) . An appointment schedule clearly explain follow-up card mark unique patient identification number hand . Each unique patient identification number randomise treatment regimen study start information contain seal envelope . The first dose study drug dispense health clinic ( child swallow , Coartem® tablets dissolve , ASAQ tablet crush minimal amount water dispense help syringe dropper ) . Intake observe 30 minute . If child vomit , rest period 15 minute observe attempt repeat dose . Any concomitant prescription collect designate pharmacy care take ensure instruction home treatment clear parent/caretaker . Before sent home , patient 's parent/caretaker repeatedly advise bring him/her back study clinic time symptom persist worsen . In order administer even dos Coartem® , home visitor/village health worker go patient 's home 8h , 32h 56h first dose . Thus recruitment study take place OPD 12pm . 3.10.2 FOLLOW-UP ( DAY 1 TO DAY42 ) On Days 1 2 , study drug treatment continue ; fourth ( Day 1 ) sixth ( Day 2 ) Coartem® dose administer home describe home visitor . However patient return MSF clinic clinical assessment ( include measurement axillary temperature ) parasitological examination malaria slide . All ASAQ 3rd 5th Coartem® dos observe clinic visit . On Days 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 42 , patient return MSF clinic clinical assessment ( include axilliary temperature ) blood smear examination . If treatment failure observe ( ETF , LCF LPF ) rescue treatment initiate . For LCF LPF occur Day 7 ( since re-infection lead clinical symptom day 7 assume 's recrudescence ) second blood sample collect FTA card PCR analysis . For unscheduled visit patient , clinical assessment perform , malaria slide ( blood sample PCR case treatment failure ) may take sign symptoms possible malaria . Before sent home visit , parent/caretaker advise bring patient back MSF clinic time case illness . In case emergency outside work hour , parents/caretakers advise bring appointment card inform emergency staff child 's inclusion study . Instructions give emergency staff report information concern event study coordinator next morning . Attempts trace child fail return schedule visit make immediately home visitor minimise loss follow-up . Patients fail return day 1 2 miss one dose treatment withdrawn study . After day 3 , patient fail return day 7 present day 6 8 ( likewise day 13/15 , day 20/22 , day 27/29 , day 34/36 day 41/43 ) may still include analysis . 3.10.3 MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES - Weight measure near 100 g hang scale ( Salter ) properly calibrate undergarment keep child . - Height measure wooden height board , ask child stand s/he &gt; 85 cm , lay child horizontally s/he &lt; 85 cm . - MUAC measure left arm , mid-point elbow shoulder record near mm . - Oedema assess 3 second thumb pressure dorsal surface foot . - Axillary temperature measure calibrated digital thermometer graduate Celsius , precision 0.1°C . If result &lt; 36.0°C , measurement repeat . 3.11 LABORATORY TECHNIQUES 3.11.1 MALARIA SLIDES Thick thin smear prepare slide stain 10 % Giemsa solution ( pH 7.2 ) 10-15 minute . All smear must read 100 field declare negative . Species confirm thin smear . Quantification P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia thick smear perform accord WHO protocol26 . Parasites count least 200 white blood cells/leucocytes ( WBC ) , parasite density ( express parasite per µL blood ) calculate assume normal level 8000 WBC/µL : Parasite density ( /µL ) = number parasite count x 8000 / number WBC count If 500 parasite count reach 200 WBC , count stop end field parasitaemia calculate formula . If less 10 parasite count 200 WBC , count extend 500 white cell . Presence absence P. falciparum gametocyte influence endpoint classification , record carefully systematically . If smear contains gametocyte trophozoite ( asexual parasite ) consider negative . Two qualified microscopist read slide independently , parasite density calculate average two count . Blood smear discordant result ( difference two microscopist specie diagnosis , parasite density &gt; 50 % presence parasite ) re-examined third , independent microscopist parasite density calculate average two close count . All blood smear destroy data analysis complete . 3.11.2 HAEMOGLOBIN MEASUREMENT The HemoCue B-Haemoglobin analyser ( Ängelholm , Sweden ) apparatus use measure haemoglobin Day 0 day clinically warrant . 3.11.3 PCR GENOTYPING PCR genotyping analysis perform order distinguish true recrudescence ( parasite strain ) newly acquire infection ( different parasite strain ) . Capillary blood sample PCR collect patient enrolment follow-up case LCF LPF Day 7 . 2-3 drop capillary blood collect FTA card , store individually zip-lock bag desiccant , keep away humidity , excessive heat light . The genotyping perform department Medical Microbiology , Academic Medical Center ( Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) , supervision Prof. Dr Tom van Gool . A material transfer agreement sign . The genotyping procedure base comparison two-locus genotype result expression P. falciparum MSP-1 MSP-2 gene allele pre- ( enrolment ) post-treatment ( failure ) samples27 . Pre- post-treatment pair similar genotype classify recrudescence ( true failure ) , pair different genotype classify re-infection . 3.11.4 QUALITY CONTROL OF MALARIA DIAGNOSIS Before study start , correct laboratory procedure , stain technique , stain time , dilution data reporting establish . A blinded re-reading routine malaria slide ( least 20 positive ) perform discordance review . An external quality control , reference parasitological laboratory , envisage end study random sample 20 positive slide collect Day 0 Day 42 . 3.11.5 MOLECULAR MARKERS FOR ANTI-MALARIAL DRUG RESISTANCE Currently clear molecular marker associate decreased susceptibility ACTs . Therefore anticipate moment study molecular marker ACT resistance . However region chromosome 13 P. falciparum genome link decreased parasite clearance rate response ACTs identified28 . If putative marker artemisinin resistance identify next 5 year FTA card study make available World Wide Antimalarial Resistance Network ( WWARN ) analysis . Permission store FTA card -70⁰C Amsterdam Medical Centre , The Netherlands 5 year termination study , use determination molecular marker resistance therefore request informed consent form . 3.12 DATA ANALYSIS 3.12.1 DATA MANAGEMENT All case record form ( CRF ) double-entered daily use EpiData 3.1 software ( Odense , Denmark ) , merge ( verification inconsistency ) analyse use Stata ( Stata Corporation , USA ) statistical software . An interim analysis early treatment failure carry participant reach day 3 blood smear result available . This assess early stage whether non-inferiority hypothesis regard early treatment failure reject . At end study analysis , CRFs source data ( consent form , laboratory register , screen form , etc ) store securely capital level . Data also submit WWARN database international monitoring anti-malarial drug resistance . A copy CRFs also store least 5 year MSF-OCA Amsterdam . The principal investigator responsible keep screening form , case report form complete subject identification code list secure location . 3.12.2 ANALYSIS PLAN - Description study : number patient screen , number patient P. falciparum infection , number patient infected Plasmodium specie , number patient exclude ( , possible , reason non-eligibility ) , number include , randomise analysable patient - Validity study : result internal external laboratory quality control , % overall non analysable patient % overall non analysable patient % loss follow-up - Characteristics include patient : age , sex , weight-for-height , previous intake anti-malarials , axillary temperature , parasite density , gametocyte carriage , haemoglobin . Chi-square test perform test adequacy randomisation . - Description study endpoint : number ETF , LCF , LPF ACPR Day 42 . Similar outcome would assess Day 28 comparison Day 42 efficacy . - Adverse event : proportion adverse event serious adverse event patient include study drug ; - PCR genotyping analysis : number sample analyse , number recrudescence episodes re-infections , number mixed undetermined result - Efficacy estimate : Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method use without genotyping adjustment . Patients withdrawn , lose follow-up re-infections censored analysis day . Patients recurrence parasitaemia , miss undetermined PCR result censor last visit malaria smear find negative ( know patient 'cured ' point ) . - Data analysis : Per-protocol analysis follow survival analysis use Kaplan-Meier method . In addition reason withdrawal list , patient consider withdrawn analysis PCR result unclassifiable result PCR indicate failure due re-infection P. vivax . P. malariae P. ovale . The cumulative incidence success failure rate day 28/42 , PCR-uncorrected PCR-corrected drug ; proportion early treatment failure , late clinical failure , late parasitological failure adequate clinical parasitological response day 28/42 , 95 % confidence interval , PCR-uncorrected PCR-corrected calculate 3.12.3 STUDY REPORT At end study , principal investigator submit report study main outcome . This report share national malaria control programme Ministry Health . The study result present appropriate scientific meeting potentially publish peer-reviewed journal . Data also submit WWARN database international monitoring anti-malarial drug resistance . Study result share community leader , patient meeting .
