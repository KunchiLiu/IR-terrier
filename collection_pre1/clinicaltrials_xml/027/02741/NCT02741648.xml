	<detailed_description>Anemia digestive tract complication common problem Extremely Low Birth Weight infant . Anemia condition body enough red blood cell ( RBC ) . RBCs important contain hemoglobin , substance carry oxygen throughout body . Transfusions RBCs infant frequently require correct anemia . Oxygen level digestive tract measure , blood transfusion use tissue oxygen monitor call Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . By use technology , good understanding obtain intestinal blood flow pattern . In addition , ELBW infants likely immature digestive system risk digestive tract problem necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . NEC disease characterize infection decrease blood flow intestine . NEC major cause devastate illness death vulnerable preterm population . Leftover blood sample , urine , stool , breast milk sample collect , frozen , store . In event baby develop digestive tract complication study laboratory identify marker indicate healthy digestive tract versus illness .</detailed_description>
