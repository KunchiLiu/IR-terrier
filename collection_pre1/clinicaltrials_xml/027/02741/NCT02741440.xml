	<brief_summary>Background : Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 ( SCA7 ) disease people problem coordination , balance , speech vision . It cause change ATXN7 gene . A mutation ATXN7 gene cause change eye cell , lead vision loss . There cure SCA7 researcher look possible treatment . Researchers need information SCA7 . They want collect vision neurology relate data people SCA7 . They want learn change eye brain ATXN7 gene work properly . Objective : To learn SCA7 progression . Eligibility : People age 12 old SCA7 . Design : Participants screen medical history genetic test previous National Eye Institute study personal physician . Participants least 7 visit 5 year . They 2 visit first week study . Then ask come back every year next 5 year . Each visit last several day include : - Medical eye history - Several eye test : include dilate pupil eye drop take photo scan eye . - Electroretinography ( ERG ) : Participants sit dark eye patch 30 minute . After , patch remove contact lens put eye . They watch flash light information record . - Neurological exam : Sensation , strength , coordination , reflex , attention , memory , language , cognitive function test . - Brain MRI : They lie machine take picture brain . - Blood urine test - Optional skin biopsy : About 3 millimeter skin remove research test ; half size pencil eraser .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Spinocerebellar Ataxia , type 7 ( SCA7 ) autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterize progressive ataxia , retinal degeneration , mark genetic anticipation . The objective study 1 ) establish cohort participant molecularly-confirmed SCA7 anticipation future clinical trial , 2 ) create repository plasma , DNA , skin fibroblast sample accrue cohort SCA7 participant , 3 ) formulate clinical outcome measure future study , 4 ) acquire perform preliminary analysis data may advance understand progression retinal neurodegeneration associate molecularly-confirmed SCA7 . Study Population : Twenty-five ( 25 ) participant , age 12 , molecularly-confirmed SCA7 accrue study . Design : In natural history study , participant follow least five year . Because three year may require enroll 25 participant , study last eight year . All participant undergo standardized medical/ophthalmic history complete baseline eye examination , include non-invasive electrophysiology ( e.g. , electroretinography ) , psychophysiology ( e.g. , microperimetry , static perimetry ) , diagnostic imaging examination ( e.g. , optical coherence tomography ) . In addition , participant undergo detailed neurology exam , neuroimaging ( MRI , include special sequence ) neuropsychologic assessment . To establish baseline , participant undergo two separate detail eye examination single neurology/neuroimaging examination within one two week period . Afterwards , return NEI clinic annually last-enrolled participant reach five year follow-up . Therefore , study require minimum five study visit . Follow-up visit consist single detailed eye exam single detailed neurology/neuroimaging exam . Participants may see frequent interval investigator discretion , depend clinical research situation . Participants require submit blood sample research , option provide skin biopsy facilitate research cellular level . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome study determination amplitude time photopic scotopic responses electroretinogram . Secondary outcome include change visual acuity , microperimetry , peripheral visual field , color vision , macular thickness , neurologic outcome variable . Exploratory outcomes study include : 1 ) formulation clinical outcome measure future study 2 ) acquisition preliminary analysis data may advance understand progression retinal neurodegeneration associate molecularly-confirmed SCA7 . Cells skin biopsy may grow laboratory well understand SCA7 , include evaluation potential treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible , follow inclusion criterion must meet , applicable . 1 . Participant must 12 year age old . 2 . Participant must able understand sign protocol inform consent document behalf OR , case minor , legal guardian/parent ability . 3 . Participant must able produce recordable electroretinogram ( ERG ) . 4 . Participant must ability cooperate require testing . Participants unable cooperate one test may include discretion Principal Investigator . 5 . Participant must willing able provide blood sample . 6 . Any female participant childbearing potential must agree pregnancy test prior undergoing MRI . 7 . Participant molecularlyconfirmed , symptomatic SCA7 , define CAG repeat expansion ATXN7 gene great 35 repeat . Accrual bias towards low number abnormal repeat ( 35 repeat ) likely able cooperate test . Participants clinical finding consistent SCA7 relative molecular diagnosis , may include study subsequent confirmation number repeat . Patients clinical finding consistent SCA7 molecular diagnosis may evaluate NEI screening , genetics bank , evaluation treatment protocol subsequent molecular diagnosis perform within 6 month initial visit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A participant eligible follow exclusion criterion present . 1 . Participant unable cooperate ophthalmic/neurologic testing , include inability undergo brain MRI without sedation . 2 . Participant comorbidity , unrelated ocular pathology , compromise ability view/image retina and/or record ERG .</criteria>
