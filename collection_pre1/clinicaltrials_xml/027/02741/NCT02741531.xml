	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine partially fill bladder laparoscopic/robotic gynecologic surgery ( benign disease ) shorten time require spontaneously void patient determine subsequently shorten patient stay time Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) follow surgery . This intervention would compare current standard care , involve remove patient 's Foley catheter empty bladder give patient 6 hour void PACU .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Partial Bladder Filling Post-operative Time Void Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy myomectomy meet study criterion contact research assistant pre-operative visit . The risk benefit participation explain . If choose participate sign consent form time . At time surgery , research coordinator open seal envelope contain patient 's assignment partial bladder fill bladder filling . The research coordinator notify surgeon via secure phone call secure message service patient/subject bladder partially fill completely empty relay surgeon end procedure Operating Room , unless issue patient safety operative complication .
