	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate bioequivalence Fixed-dose Combination ( FDC ) tablet formulation Dolutegravir ( DTG ) 50 milligram ( mg ) Rilpivirine ( RPV ) 25 mg versus co-administration separate tablet formulation DTG 50 mg plus RPV 25 mg , feed state . This pivotal bioequivalence study , serve pharmacokinetic ( PK ) bridge ongoing Phase 3 trial separate agent . This study conduct fed condition appropriately mimic condition Phase 3 trial . This single-center , randomize , open-label , 2-period , single-dose , crossover study . A minimum 86 healthy adult subject randomize minimum approximately 82 evaluable subject complete study . The total duration participation subject study approximately 8 week include screen visit within 30 day prior first dose study drug , two treatment period single dose study drug follow-up visit within 12-17 day last dose study drug . There washout least 21 day dose study drug . A blinded ( treatment ) review DTG RPV plasma concentration data approximately first 40 subject conduct . If within-subject coefficient variation ( CVw % ) either DTG RPV maximal drug concentration ( Cmax ) value &gt; =31 % ; sample size re-estimation employ additional subject ( beyond 86 plan ) randomize treatment study . Following re-estimation , possible approximately 154 healthy adult subject ( 68 new subject addition plan 86 subject ) randomize maximum approximately 146 evaluable subject could complete study .</brief_summary>
