	<detailed_description>The main aim study compare effectiveness safety three common bariatric surgical procedure : Roux-en-y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) , sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) . Question ( Aim ) 1 : To extent weight loss weight regain differ across three bariatric surgical procedure 1 , 3 , 5 year ? This aim address primary outcome interest among patient seek bariatric surgery - differential impact procedure maximum weight loss well extent longer-term weight regain . We also explore heterogeneity weight loss regain across several key subgroup may differential response surgical treatment , specifically group define age , race/ethnicity , baseline BMI , smoke status , pre-operative comorbidities . Question ( Aim ) 2 : To extent bariatric procedure differ improvement diabetes risk 1 , 3 , 5 year ? Among patient diabetes , remission `` cure '' disease ( define HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % diabetes medication ) cite important outcome bariatric surgery . Thus , examine comparative effect procedure rate diabetes remission well relapse ( recurrence ) . Secondary analysis examine comparative impact procedure glycemic control independent diabetes remission . Question ( Aim ) 3 : What frequency major adverse event follow three different bariatric surgical procedure 1 , 3 , 5 year ? We examine four important adverse event outcome category across three procedure : 1 ) short- long-term ( 1 , 3 , 5 year ) mortality rate , 2 ) composite end point 30-day major adverse outcome : base definition use Longitudinal Assessment Bariatric Surgery ( LABS ) study include death ; venous thromboembolism ; percutaneous , endoscopic , operative subsequent intervention ; failure discharge hospital ; 3 ) subsequent hospitalization ( hospitalization follow initial surgery ) ; 4 ) subsequent reoperation/reintervention : define additional bariatric procedure procedure related device removal , gastric revision , abdominal incisional hernia repair , laparoscopy laparotomy , percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement .</detailed_description>
