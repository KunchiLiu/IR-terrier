	<brief_title>Thromboembolic Bleeding Risk Stratification Patients With Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) excessive risk arterial thromboembolic disease heart failure , result high rate cardiovascular all-cause mortality population . Prevalence incidence Non-Valvular AF ( NVAF ) rapidly increase across develop country . cardiovascular ( CV ) all-cause mortality rate related AF increase 1990 2010 , irrespective sex . Determinants AF ( heart disease and/or cardiovascular risk factor ) , associate excess risk cardiovascular event . Primary prevention NVAF rely control modifiable risk factor , overweight , arterial hypertension , diabetes , tobacco consumption associate risk AF risk complication . Preventive treatment cardiovascular complication base anti-thrombotic treatment , reduce global ischemic risk expense increase bleed risk . Treatment decision guide evaluation ischemic hemorrhagic risk , determine clinical score ( like CHADS2 ; CHA2DS2-VASc ; HAS-BLED ) validate vary population retrospective cohort study . However , since publication , clinical score criticize regard predictive value , lack precision definition component threshold define treatment decision . Furthermore , several study demonstrate interest biomarkers addition clinical parameter predict risk cardiovascular complication AF . For example , preliminary data suggest dosage Brain-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , N-terminal ( NT ) Pro-BNP , troponin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , indicator whose level increase independently usual cause may contribute good prediction cardiovascular complication include all-cause mortality NVAF . Of note , rate major bleed event low ( 1.5 per cent among 3,978 patient Euro Heart Survey AF complete follow-up ) HAS-BLED validation cohort . We hypothesize epidemiologic , clinical , biologic , morphologic complimentary data could improve stratification cardiovascular risk NVAF . Biologic echocardiographic approach , particular , could improve performance routinely use clinical score . Consequently , identification state inflammation , hypercoagulability , increase circulate concentration certain biomarkers could explain increased risk cardiovascular event AF . Furthermore , morphologic repercussion NVAF , include leave atrium dilation leave ventricular systolic dysfunction , well presence leave atrial appendage stasis indicator , could also help refine risk stratification . In previous retrospective survey , investigator show biomarkers echomarkers could better stratify AF patient increase cardiovascular risk . However , due retrospective design lack completeness , investigator could validate new risk score include marker take account thromboembolic hemorrhagic risk . Indeed , usual biologic morphologic parameter obtain admission patient prospective design . There three study site . Professor Ariel COHEN coordinate investigator study . A Clinical Research Associate work within Cardiology Service Saint-Antoine Hospital monitor study . The study duration 5 year : - Inclusion period : 3 year - End study : 2 year end inclusion period - Follow-up : follow-up period run 2 year . Inclusion : The inclusion visit occur patient 's hospitalization NVAF Cardiology Department . At inclusion visit , information collect regard patient 's history clinical event , current risk factor treatment . Follow-up : After hospital discharge , patient see every six month throughout two year follow-up period . During follow-up period , information clinical event , change risk factor treatment occur since last follow-up contact collect patient , blood sample collect , echocardiography conduct . Classification precede event follow-up information support clinical exam medical file evaluation . Interviews general practitioner patient also use order collect necessary information . In event hospitalization , hospitalization report collect . In case event without hospitalization , general practitioner correspondence prescription record collect . Patients NVAF receive anti-thrombotic treatment , accordance routine care European society cardiology ( ESC ) guideline . The choice anti-thrombotic treatment entirely discretion attend physician hospitalization . Information describe treatment receive patient collect throughout study , inclusion visit final follow-up contact . All echocardiographic procedure perform echocardiographic laboratory Cardiology Department . Cardiologists specialize echocardiographic examination perform echocardiographic procedure . Each participant undergo echocardiographic examination inclusion follow-up visit occur every 6 month . The objective echocardiographic examination identification cardiac condition disease may associate AF . Primary Outcome variables The primary outcome variable composite cardiovascular endpoint include stroke , transitory ischemic attack , thromboembolism , acute heart failure , acute coronary syndrome , major bleed cardiovascular all-cause mortality . ( Major bleeding define accord international society thrombosis haemostasis ( ISTH ) criterion ) Secondary Outcome variables The incidence follow event determine : - death ( all-cause cardiovascular ) - acute heart failure - stroke - acute coronary syndrome - major bleed episode Enrolled participant include analysis . Participants withdraw consent exclude analysis . Participants event lose follow-up ( impossibility contact 24 month ) include date last contact . Event free survival define time period day enrollment study day event death . Overall survival calculate patient start enrollment death end follow-up . One analysis per event type conduct . One vital status research conduct participant lose follow-up ; appropriate cause death research undertaken . To deal possibility patient present multiple event , consider compete risk model .</detailed_description>
