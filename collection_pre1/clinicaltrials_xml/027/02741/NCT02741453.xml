	<detailed_description>Central venous catheter placement common procedure intensive care unit require skill resident work critical care set . Central venous catheter ( CVC ) place variety reason include administration caustic medication , administration fluid blood product rapid resuscitation , access hemodynamic monitoring transvenous pacing , temporary vascular access dialysis , inability obtain peripheral IV access . The 2011 CDC Guidelines Prevention Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections recommend placement CVC subclavian vein rather internal jugular vein minimize infection risk . However , due lack experience placement subclavian vein , Vanderbilt MICU , common resident place catheter internal jugular vein . Placement CVC ultrasound guidance become standard care also recommend aforementioned CDC guideline ( CDC guideline ) . Ultrasound guidance CVC placement improve patient safety reduce rate complication , improve success rate , decrease number attempt time successful insertion ( Brass ) . The benefit ultrasound guidance reduce complication especially important less experienced operator resident place CVC ( Rando , Airapetian , Dodge ) . The addition ultrasound machine otherwise sterile procedure increase rate catheter associate blood stream infection ( Cartier ) . Placement IJ CVC right instead leave commonly prefer due direct path superior vena cava . However , placement leave IJ may necessary variety reason . Depending head position , degree overlap right IJ right carotid artery may make right side placement precarious due risk arterial puncture ( Ozbek , Maecken ) . Previously undetected IJ thrombus right may also prevent CVC placement , require switch contralateral side ( Goel ) . Ultrasound guidance could also reveal unilateral vascular anatomic anomaly would otherwise complicate CVC insertion ( Benter , Rossi ) . For reason , investigator intend compare standard practice resident place IJ CVC medical ICU mandatory screen right left IJ prior selection CVC placement site . The benefit ultrasound guidance IJ CVC placement well establish . However , benefit ultrasound guidance may extend fully evaluate leave right IJ prior choose side placement . As mentioned previously , several factor could make placement CVC particular side either successful precarious . These factor include possible asymmetric diameter IJ vein , unfavorable relationship IJ carotid artery , pre-existing IJ thrombus , aberrant vascular anatomy . This study begin 4 month period data collection standard practice IJ CVC placement resident medical intensive care unit . Data collect success rate CVC insertion measure `` first stick '' placement catheter . The study also record often placement CVC must abort favor attempt contralateral side . Any incidental detection pre-existing condition could complicate CVC placement , include IJ thrombus aberrant anatomy , also record . Finally , investigator record rate immediate complication CVC placement , include pneumothorax , hemothorax , arterial placement puncture CVC catheter . In medical ICU institution study occur , nurse practitioner perform similar duty resident separate similarly operate ICU team . Data central line placement nurse practitioner also collect . The specific aim threefold : Specific Aim 1 : To assess first pas overall success rate IJ vein evaluate ultrasound compare standard IJ CVC placement ultrasound . Specific Aim 2 : To assess rate aborted procedure two study period , define failure catheter placement side first needle puncture site failure catheter placement overall . Specific Aim 3 : To assess rate complication IJ central venous catheter place evaluation bilateral IJ site compare current practice place IJ catheter ultrasound guidance .</detailed_description>
