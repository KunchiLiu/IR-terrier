	<brief_summary>This protocol seek enroll smolder multiple myeloma ( SMM ) patient λ light chain ( LC ) involvement , group patient standard care observation treatment . Patients SMM precursor plasma cell disorder light chain amyloidosis ( AL ) often evolve . In trial blood bone marrow cell evaluate molecular test determine clonal λ LC variable region ( VL ) germline gene . The repertoire clonal germline gene employ AL restrict ; 70 % case AL involve 7 germline donor , 5 λ germline donor . The hypothesis test protocol presence VL germline gene associate AL patient pre-existing diagnosis λ SMM indicative risk progression AL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Diagnostic Screening Trial Seeking AL Amyloidosis Very Early</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In trial 200 smolder multiple myeloma ( SMM ) patient λ light chain ( LC ) involvement whose κ : :λ LC ratio &lt; 0.26 whose clonal minus non-clonal LC difference ( call dFLC ) great 23mg/L recruit . Heavy chain type affect patient eligibility long involved LC λ type . The assay free LC routine standard test patient monoclonal gammopathy provide basis screening . Patients learn trial internet advertisement , contact data manager , consent participate writing , sign HIPAA release form allow PI receive medical data relevant λ LC SMM ; standard physician-to-physician medical practice apply . Patient recruitment open eligible patient within United States . Informed consent may obtain person phone call PI . The patient 's physician contact informed patient 's consent enrollment study ask provide medical record screen . If patient find eligible , patient physician inform require sample need protocol , include one-time donation peripheral blood one-time donation marrow aspirate , take routine clinical procedure . Prepaid FedEx box provide study ship research sample Tufts Medical Center remote patient . Both peripheral blood marrow sample test presence variable region ( VL ) germline gene . Samples process day arrival store -80 degree Celsius . The result laboratory test share patient physician sample process . No sample request participant time part study . The analysis trial base frequency λ LC SMM patient find gene associate light chain amyloidosis ( AL ) diagnose AL , AL-associated gene progress AL . The diagnosis AL tissue diagnosis . If amyloidosis suspect time subject 's participation , physician contact give recommendation regard diagnostic test disease stag .</detailed_description>
