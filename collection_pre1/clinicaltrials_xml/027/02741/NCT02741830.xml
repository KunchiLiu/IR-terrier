	<brief_title>Uterosacral Ligament Suspension v Robotic Sacrocolpopexy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse common problem affect many woman 12.6 % lifetime risk undergo reconstructive pelvic surgery . There several surgical option available patient undergo reconstruction pelvic organ prolapse , however address apex recommend achieve durable outcome . Two commonly perform procedure apical prolapse repair uterosacral ligament suspension robotic sacrocolpopexy . High uterosacral ligament suspension native tissue repair perform affix vaginal apex bilateral uterosacral ligament use permanent delayed-absorbable suture . This perform typically vaginal approach . Sacrocolpopexy perform attach anterior posterior vaginal wall sacral promontory use synthetic mesh , typically polypropylene . This procedure perform abdominal approach , laparoscopic approach assistance da Vinci robotic system . In recent year , robotic sacrocolpopexy largely replace abdominal approach , become procedure choice minimally invasive surgeon . Most study evaluate sacrocolpopexy outcome perform prior popularity robotics therefore concentrate abdominal sacrocolpopexy . This cross sectional , two cohort study compare outcomes uterosacral ligament suspension versus robotic sacrocolpopexy give pelvic surgeon well understand durability procedure , possible long term complication rate . Subjects contact ask come office visit completion questionnaire . If come office , Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) questionnaires mailed complete return separately .</detailed_description>
