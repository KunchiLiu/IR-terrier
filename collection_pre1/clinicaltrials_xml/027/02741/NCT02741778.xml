	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Sweet Esophagectomy Patients With Siewert Type II Adenocarcinoma Esophagogastric Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma ( AEG ) 1 region 5 cm region esophageal gastric junction . Due special anatomical location , biological behavior esophageal cancer gastric cancer . Because wide range lesion , majority Siewert classification system divide three type : I type , CM type , CM 1-5 , 5 cm CM L , traditional meaning cardiac carcinoma . In investigator country , majority patient type II III 2,3,4 . For resection esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma , main treatment method treatment surgical treatment . The high incidence type II type III AEG , type III patient use abdominal approach proximal gastrectomy , Department general surgery . In patient lesion , lymph node metastasis also characterize bidirectional transfer lymph node peritoneal cavity lesion two boundary . In order ensure upper cut edge esophagus dissection mediastinal lymph node , domestic Department thoracic surgery . For part patient , traditional standard surgical approach leave thoracic approach open phrenoesophageal , partial resection stomach , aortic arch esophagogastric anastomosis + thoraco abdominal 2-field lymph node dissection dissection [ 5,6 ] . The minimally invasive surgery treatment esophageal cancer gastric cancer widely accept domestic foreign counterpart . For I type AEG patient type Ivor-Lewis type III AEG patient commonly use treatment gastric cancer , correspond minimally invasive surgery certain development [ 7,8 ] . And type II AEG patient relatively standard minimally invasive surgery , unit carry home abroad . Therefore , choose minimally invasive method complete operation thorough . It become hot research topic domestic foreign doctor . It important clinical significance application prospect . For type II type esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma , mainstream traditional surgical method leave chest approach open chest . The operation follow disadvantage : 1 ) integrity chest wall diaphragm , impact chest abdomen patient large , close long-term life quality greatly affect traditional surgery use right side chest , abdominal lymph node dissection diaphragm complete , complete abdominal approach poor . The foreign part center small lesion type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma underwent minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy , exist follow drawback : 1 ) suitable large tumor ; 2 ) gastric resection enough , type esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma essence special type gastric carcinoma , proximal gastric resection removal one standard . And position operation relatively high , lead large number esophageal resection , length esophageal resection 3 . The 5cm sufficient . Therefore , implement minimally invasive surgical approach upper low middle upper mediastinal abdominal lymph node hot research topic field esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma . Up , reasonable standard minimally invasive surgery treatment type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma . The investigator sum experience past minimally invasive resection esophageal cancer , combine domestic foreign research result . Pioneered laparoscopic mobilization stomach dissection abdominal field lymph node + thoracoscopic ( left thoracic approach ) free esophagus clean + mirror purse string forceps esophagogastric aortic arch anastomosis lower mediastinal lymph node , correspond operation traditional left thoracotomy combine open operation diaphragm . Can achieve traditional surgical resection tumor , take account characteristic minimally invasive surgery . In study , case type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma case collect 120 patient type II esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma prospective randomize control clinical trial . Comparison different surgical method patient safety surgery , oncology resection range , incidence short-term complication . The effect different surgical method survival rate quality life two group compare postoperative follow-up . The surgical treatment esophageal carcinoma reasonable level type II type esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma improve , surgical treatment esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma improve .</detailed_description>
