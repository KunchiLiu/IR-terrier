	<brief_summary>The standard practice arthroscopic shoulder surgery institution general anesthetic long-acting interscalene block post-operative pain control , reduce amount opiate need surgery . The interscalene block effective providing analgesia majority shoulder joint show reduce post-operative pain score arthroscopic shoulder surgery . However , subset arthroscopic shoulder surgery patient pain axilla even set function interscalene brachial plexus nerve block . One surgeon report high incidence axillary pain patient undergo sub-pectoral biceps tenodesis part arthroscopic procedure . A newly describe nerve block approach nerve supply sensation axillary region call PECS `` Pectoralis '' 1 &amp; 2 block may provide additional analgesia patient . The purpose prospective , randomize , observer patient blind , single-center , sham block trial determine addition PECS block interscalene block reduce severity axillary pain follow arthroscopic shoulder surgery involve sub-pectoral biceps tenodesis . Secondarily , study assess duration PECS 1 &amp; 2 whether block reduces post-operative opioid usage . We hypothesize addition PECS 1 &amp; 2 block reduce severity axillary pain 6hrs reduce postoperative narcotic usage first 24 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects meet inclusion criterion assign group use random number generator . All subject receive standard practice institution interscalene brachial plexus block along general anesthetic . The intervention arm get additional local anesthetic block target nerve presume cover axillary region ( PECS `` Pectoralis '' 1 &amp; 2 ) . These nerve upper chest lateral branch 2nd 5th intercostal nerve , include intercostobrachial nerve . The anesthesiologist place nerve block un-blinded perform procedure . Both surgeon Acute Pain Service anesthesiologist blind whether intervention provide give subject . The Acute Pain Service team remain blind collect data outcome . Initially , pilot data collect total ten patient five patient randomized arm . Primary endpoint NRS `` Numerical Rating Scale '' 0-10 6hrs block placement . Our pilot data indicate mean NRS 5 control group , standard deviation 1.4 . Using two-sided two-sample test ( alpha 0.05 power 0.95 ) , conservatively estimate 14 subject per arm need detect clinically meaningful difference 2 NRS arm . We decide plan enrollment 20 subject per arm potential loss randomize , double-blinded , single-center , sham block trial . - Potential subject undergo arthroscopy electronic medical record review study team look exclusion criterion . If subject exclude , add Screening Log date reason exclusion . If inclusion criterion meet , subject approach Regional Anesthesia area consent . A copy consent give study subject . The informed consent document maintain study team research file . - Patients ask provide baseline pain score , rest movement , scale 0-10 ( 0 pain 10 bad pain ) . Preoperative opioid use include drug ( ) , dosage frequency record . Randomization patient occur use sequentially numbered envelope directly involve care patient block placement aware arm study patient randomize . Those member study team collect post-operative data blind randomization . Standard American Society Anesthesiology monitor oxygen apply . Unless contraindication , patient receive 650mg `` milligram '' oral acetaminophen . To standardize effect postoperative pain , ketamine give preoperative sedation medication intraoperative medication . No long acting opioids give operate room post-anesthesia care unit . Intraoperative fentanyl limit 5 microgram per kg `` kilogram '' . Intraoperative dexamethasone give post-operative nausea/vomiting prophylaxis . Subjects sedate per usual practice also blind randomization . All peripheral nerve block perform resident fellow supervision attend anesthesiologist . The attend anesthesiologist may perform procedure alone . All volume concentration nerve block mixture administer identical assist blind process . All 40 subject receive ultrasound guide interscalene nerve block use 20mL `` milliliter '' 0.25 % bupivacaine 1:400,000 epinephrine 1:600,000 clonidine dose upper trunk location near 6th cervical vertebral level , per standard clinical practice . The intervention arm , consist 20 patient , additionally receive following : 10mL 0.25 % bupivacaine 1:400,000 epinephrine 1:600,000 clonidine PECS1 location 20mL 0.25 % bupivacaine 1:400,000 epinephrine 1:600,000 clonidine PECS2 location describe Blanco , et al.3,4 All procedure perform sterile technique include use chlorhexidine prep skin , sterile glove , sterile ultrasound probe cover sterile ultrasound gel , cap mask . For interscalene block , 21 gauge 90mm `` millimeter '' stimulate block needle direct , real-time ultrasound guidance , interscalene muscle space level 5th 6th cervical nerve root . Twenty mL local anesthetic mixture dose incrementally , aspirate every 5 mL , surround upper trunk brachial plexus . For PECS 1 &amp; 2 block , 21 gauge 90mm stimulating block needle place real-time ultrasound guidance approximately level 4th 5th rib near mid-axillary line . The needle advanced tissue plane serratus anterior muscle pectoralis minor muscle . Twenty mL local anesthetic mixture dose incrementally , every 5 mL , spread within PEC2 space . The needle withdrawn , follow first injection , tissue plane pectoralis minor pectoralis major muscle . Ten mL local anesthetic mixture dose incrementally , every 5 mL , spread within PEC1 space . Fifteen 30 minute ( change 15min ) follow block placement , success assess absence/decrease pin-prick sensation 25 gauge Whitacre needle follow manner : Cutaneous sensation test deltoid region assess successful interscalene block . Cutaneous sensation test lateral aspect pectoralis muscle level nipple . Scoring sensation follow : 0= full sensation , 1= partial sensation , 2= sensation ( complete block ) Following block placement , subject transport OR general anesthesia induce . Following intubation , surgical procedure , emergence extubation , subject transport recovery room . In recovery room via phone post-discharge , 6 hour mark post-block placement , ask subject axillary pain . The severity pain determine use Numerical Rating Scale 0-10 . Zero pain 10 pain possible . Total opiate benzodiazepine dos chart preoperative , intraoperative PACU time frame .</detailed_description>
