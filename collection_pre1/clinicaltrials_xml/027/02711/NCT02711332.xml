	<brief_title>Investigating Influence Haemolysis Potassium Concentration After Capillary Blood Sampling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>K @ Home_1 work package FFG project `` K @ Home - potassium home monitoring patient heart- kidney insufficiency '' . In project K @ Home potassium measure system serveable patient even home monitoring develop . Aim K @ Home allow everyday home monitoring potassium value development potassium-test stripe , like diabetes patient supervise blood sugar level measurement glucose-test stripe drop capillary blood finger berry emergencies hospital admission reduce prevent . It fact haemolysis strong influence measure potassium concentration . It likely use capillary blood haemolysis appear therefore distorted potassium concentration measure . In study K @ Home_1 matter evaluate , high degree haemolysis capillary blood , fact extent lead wrong potassium value . The result study basic component sensor development . After clarification approval Informed Consent sign inclusion well exclusion criterion ( incl . demography , concomitant medication medical history ) vital parameter ( blood pressure , pulse , size , weight ) , raise . An urine-pregnancy test also carry exclusion pregnancy woman capable bearing child . It necessary subject seem sober study day . With 22 healthy subject capillary venous blood take within scope one single study round . Blood take test person train specialist staff two fingertip hand ( total four fingertip ) . The capillary blood sampling occur 200 Âµ l Lithium-Heparin Sarsted Microvettes case first drop blood reject . To guarantee light blood decrease without strong mechanical pressure , hand warmed capillary sampling require help electric blanket warm water roughly room temperature . In addition 15 ml blood vein forearm take .</detailed_description>
