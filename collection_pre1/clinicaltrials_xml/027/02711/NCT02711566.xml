	<brief_summary>Robot-assisted therapy proven effective neuromotor rehabilitation eg stroke survivor . Robots program interact patient guide movement , monitor performance quantify type degree impairment . A distinctive element multiple sclerosis involvement variety functional system , way highly subject-specific . This require personalization treatment , continuous adaptation change condition . This point need integrate patient assessment , definition rehabilitation protocol , administration assessment outcome . The goal study ass , person MS , efficacy type robot-assisted training specifically design counteract incoordination muscle weakness ( typical MS ) , tailor individual type degree impairment , compare simple movement training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robot-based Rehabilitation Upper Limb Impairment Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , potential robot treatment person motor disability raise considerable interest . These device may interact patient assist perturb movement , may monitor performance even quantify impairment . Clinical trial involve stroke survivor clearly demonstrate robot-therapy result improved motor control . More recently , robot-therapy applied pathology . A pilot study carry proponent suggest Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) subject predominantly cerebellar symptom may indeed benefit robot-therapy . MS subject different symptom may benefit robot therapy well , variety symptom degree impairment typical MS suggest robot may fully show potential therapy tailor individual subject . In study , proponent aim extend result mention pilot study MS subject wide variety impairment . Based previous study robot therapy MS subject stroke survivor , proponent develop test robot training exercise specifically design deal incoordination and/or muscle weakness . In randomised controlled trial , proponent ass possible contribution form robot-therapy rehabilitation MS subject . A population clinically definite MS subject different degree upper limb impairment randomise 2 group : ( ) Haptic training ( ii ) Sensorimotor training . Haptic training base robot-assisted exercise protocol specifically design treat cerebellar motor symptom person MS counteracting , respectively , incoordination muscle weakness . The exercise base motor task - interaction virtual mass-spring system effect resistive load - require sophisticated coordination skill . Task difficulty ( time constant mass-spring system ) magnitude resistive load ( stiffness magnitude resistive spring ) automatically adjust individual subject ' upper limb impairment . In Sensorimotor training , task exactly , robot generates force . Hand target position display computer screen . This group allow quantify specific contribution robot assistance sensorimotor recovery ( ) . Both group perform 8-10 therapy session ( 1 hour/each , 2-3 time per week ) . Treatment outcome assess term Nine-Hole Peg Test ( 9HPT ) ARAT score .</detailed_description>
