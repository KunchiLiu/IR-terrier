	<brief_summary>Regular exercise patient heart disease highly beneficial improves quality life survival . Exercise training consider core component cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) , multicomponent program deliver patient heart disease . However , severely underutilized people simply n't time resource travel CR centre attend rehab appointment . The investigator develop novel virtual reality ( VR ) base CR exercise system ( MedBike ) . This system consist exercise bike attach VR world ; make exercise engage fun . Furthermore , patient monitor exercise remotely internet . The investigator intend perform pilot randomize control trial 10 patient assign MedBike system 10 standard CR . The investigator think MedBike system increase exercise program compliance provide enjoyable engaging exercise experience perform comfort one 's home . The investigator think improve fitness ( primary endpoint ) patient . If investigator demonstrate home base exercise feasible , investigator plan large study prove something broadly implement patient heart disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Regular exercise , incorporate part comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program , improve morbidity mortality cardiac patient , especially elevate risk profile . It report review exercise decrease all-cause mortality , cardiac mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction 20 25 % . Of critical importance , CR non-participants exhibit 30 % low survival rate participate . Even though exercise training consider core component cardiac rehabilitation severely underutilized . The majority adult patient participate exercise rehabilitation follow cardiac event cardiac surgery ; eligible , completion rate 15 % 30 % . Factors associate poor compliance include great distance hospital , need transportation ( e.g . parking fee ) , lack self motivation , poor social support , low self-esteem , fear safety lack enjoyment . In order overcome barrier , researcher clinician turn toward eHealth solution decentralize CR process , increase accessibility , potentially increase comfort enjoyment derive exercise . This approach align closely American Heart Association 's recommendation Internet-based technique use improve CR experience patient healthcare provider . The Advanced Man Machine Interface Laboratory ( AMMI ) , University Alberta develop novel virtual reality ( VR ) enhance exercise system ( MedBIKE ) provide engage enjoyable exercise experience allow CR patient exercise comfort home . The system consist mountain bike mount wirelessly control resistance machine feed directly VR console . This VR console allows heighten exercise experience patient allow cycle virtual landscape . While exercise , patient monitor remotely real-time CR clinician use wireless biometric sensor ( electrocardiogram , blood pressure , pulse oximetry ) bidirectional audio-video Internet connection . The investigator believe enhance exercise experience , eliminate distance transportation issue , provide ongoing support key healthcare provider , patient compliance CR exercise program improve . The MedBIKE test clinical trial . Objective Hypothesis : To perform randomize pilot feasibility study ass : 1 . Feasibility CR patient perform home-based exercise MedBIKE 2 . Effectiveness MedBIKE system improve fitness ( measure exercise tolerance test use Bruce protocol ) . Since feasibility trial , fully power investigator gain preliminary information sample size calculation ( large trial ) 3 . Effectiveness MedBIKE system improve patient compliance CR . The investigator hypothesize home-based CR use MedBIKE system feasible effectively improve fitness compliance ( frequent exercise session great number total hour ) . The latter endpoint may reach statistical significance investigator plan large funding application Canadian Institute Health Research properly power study base upon sample size calculation provide pilot randomize control trial . Methods Adults ( age 18y older ) recent cardiac event , angioplasty cardiac surgery ( within 2 week ) refer CR Jim Pattison Centre Heart Health ( JPCHH ) enrol pilot randomise control trial . Consecutive , consent subject randomise 1:1 ( computer base randomisation independent clinical trial centre ensure allocation concealment independent study team ) MedBike system standard rehabilitation JPCHH . Subjects : Twenty participant ( 10 intervention 10 control ) enrol . To avoid enrol high risk subject require in-person CR supervision , investigator exclude subject history heart failure , cardiomyopathy , severe valvular disease rhythm disturbances require cardioversion . Patients defibrillator unable consent , speak English , comprehend study procedure , cycle stationary bike , perform treadmill test , access internet home exclude . Controls ( Standard CR ) The standard cardiac rehab program 8 week duration , patient exercise supervision per week JPCHH . Each session consist 30 minute cardiorespiratory exercise moderate intensity ( 60 80 % predicted heart rate max maximum effort achieve exercise tolerance test ) 5-minute warm-up cool period . Participants encourage supplement JPCHH program additional optional 2-3 activity session per week perform home commercial exercise facility , accordance standard therapy protocol JCPHH . No upper limit training session set . Intervention Subjects intervention arm complete exercise prescription assign JPCHH patient ( i.e.one session schedule per week 8 week describe ) . MedBIKE patient also encourage use MedBIKE additional 2-3x/week ( optional training session ) . No upper limit training session set . Scheduled training session monitor remotely real-time cardiac rehabilitation clinician JPCHH via bidirectional audio-video feed . Biometric information ( electrocardiogram , blood pressure , pulse oximetry ) collect real time . Monitoring occur clinic room JPCHH . Biometric information training session store secure server locate within Faculty Medicine Dentistry , University Alberta . A secure , encrypt , HIPAA compliant data transmission profile utilized patient data transmission , reception storage . Additional Care Other element protocolized CR include multidisciplinary care remain unaltered group . This include supervised treadmill test perform upon admission , discharge , JPCHH use Bruce protocol . Endpoints : 1 . Fitness : Measured baseline 8wk JPCHH use Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test . The total time exercise determine . For primary endpoint , similar prior study , investigator calculate proportion patient achieve increase 1 min baseline 8 week compare proportion group . A 1 min increase correspond 1 1.5 metabolic equivalent increase Bruce protocol ; translates project 12 % 50 % reduction mortality . 2 . Compliance : comparing number schedule supervised session attend ( either JPCHH [ control ] remotely supervise [ intervention ] ) , self-reported total number exercise session participate , cumulative number hour exercise subject . These latter two endpoint thus include information collect optional exercise session . 3 . Change cardiovascular risk factor baseline 8wk : blood pressure ( BP ) , A1c , smoke status , lipid . Data Collection Analysis : Baseline data collection include age , sex , smoke status , past medical history include cardiovascular risk factor disease , height , weight , waist circumference , BP , A1c , fast lipid profile , rest heart rate , Bruce protocol treadmill time . Follow-up data collection ( 8 week ) include updated medical event , weight , waist circumference , BP , A1c , fast lipid , rest heart rate , follow-up treadmill time , self-reported total number exercise session hour exercise . Continuous variable summarize mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) dichotomous variable count proportion . Continuous outcome compare study arm use logistic regression adjust age , sex unbalanced baseline characteristic ( include primary endpoint ) . Linear regression use dichotomous outcome Poisson regression count . Sample Size : The sample size low , feasibility trial . Only one CR session per week supervise ; optional CR session ascertain self-report , prone bias . However , mitigate , fitness assess objective treadmill test .</detailed_description>
