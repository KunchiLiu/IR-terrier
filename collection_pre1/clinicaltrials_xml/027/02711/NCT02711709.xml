	<brief_summary>The purpose study define natural history cause chronic critical illness ( CCI ) surgical intensive care patient sepsis . The investigator want study sub-population sepsis patient intra-abdominal sepsis . The purpose research study define acute change frailty ( weakness , slowness , loss muscle mass ) , comorbidity ( medical problem ) disability ( difficulty mobility perform routine daily function ) infection locate abdominal cavity torso . The investigator believe severe infection contributes acute permanent change area , especially advanced age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistent Inflammation , Immunosuppression Catabolism Syndrome ( PICS ) : A New Horizon Surgical Critical Care Induced Frailty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study aim identifying frequency , natural history long term outcome CCI PICS survivor Intra-abdominal sepsis . In addition in-hospital clinical data collect parent study , pre post-sepsis measurement frailty , comorbidity disability obtain via questionnaire electronic health record . Frailty , comorbidity disability assessment also complete three , six , 12 month follow assessment . Frailty measure A frailty index determine combination factor . An old adult consider physically vulnerable experience : 1. muscle weakness 2. fatigue 3. low physical activity , unintentional loss body weight , agree upon consensus expert . Two additional non-intravenous contrast CT scan obtain 3 12 month part study protocol ass interval change SMI/sarcopenia . Objective mobility activity monitoring perform supplement assessment frailty disability . Wearable monitor ( similar size appearance `` smart watch '' receive significant attention offer minimal burden , objectivity , versatility low cost assessing activity mobility pattern . The monitor similar shape size standard wrist watch . Thus , minimal burden patient . Each monitor fit wrist worn 24 hour day , quickly remove medical procedure , patient care hygiene need . Patients wear monitor entire length stay hospital . It remove discharge . Post-discharge , patient send monitor wear 10 day four different time point : 3 month , 6 month 12 month post-discharge . If study subject hospitalize long enough discharge within 30 day 3 month follow , 1 month post discharge monitoring period defer . Outcomes include step per day , total movement per day , minute sedentary minute move various intensity ( e.g . light , moderate vigorous ) .</detailed_description>
