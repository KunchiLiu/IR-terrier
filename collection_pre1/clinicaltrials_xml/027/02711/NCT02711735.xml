In addition , attend physician ascertain overall clinical beneficial response treatment . Transient deterioration chest radiographic abnormality might explain paradoxical inflammatory response , may therefore necessarily interpret treatment failure ; decision depend consensus Data Safety Monitoring Board ; evidence improvement chest xray . Microbiological response criterion : evidence improvement least 2 measurement least 4 week apart , use Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube ( liquid culture microbiological assay read 10 day ) Inability provide write informed consent Women report , detect , willing pregnant trial period ; Severity illness preclude full evaluation : expect early death , evidence respiratory failure , low blood pressure , WHO performance score 34 ; Central Nervous System involvement TB ( TB meningitis , intracranial tuberculomas ) little evidence effective drug penetration secondline TB drug ; Major comorbid condition preclude full evaluation , i.e. , active lung cancer , acute coronary syndrome , heart failure exceed New York Heart Association class 2 ; diagnosis metastasize malignancy ; renal failure excess creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mls/min calculate CockcroftGault formula , would severely complicate administration aminoglycosides capreomycin , consider major secondline TB drug ; obesity ( Body Mass Index &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) ; chronic liver disease ChildPugh class C ; Any follow laboratory parameter : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN Neutrophil count ≤ 500 neutrophil / mm3 Platelet count &lt; 50,000 cell / mm3 Receiving anticipate receive daily dose ≥ 10 mg systemic prednisone equivalent within period start 14 day prior enrolment .
