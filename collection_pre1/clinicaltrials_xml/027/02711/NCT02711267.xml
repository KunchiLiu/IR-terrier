	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Topical Acyclovir Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , open label , exploratory research study evaluate BE already market formulation acyclovir dermal interstitial fluid ( ISF ) healthy volunteer use dOFM . The study conduct Clinical Research Center Medical University Graz . dOFM represent reliable way sample interstitial fluid skin , since provide diluted otherwise unchanged dermal interstitial fluid . To assess BE non-BE , design experiment way subject serve control . Each subject two set BE non-BE pair parallel . This study design test dOFM , new sample method allow measurement skin penetration . Measurement skin penetration enables reduction impact inter-subject variability therefore decrease number subject need achieve statistical significance .</detailed_description>
