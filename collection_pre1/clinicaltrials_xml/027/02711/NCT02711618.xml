	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Abdominal Fat Reduction With BMI Above 28</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , one arm , four site , clinical study show performance safety UltraShape contour I V3 device non-invasive abdominal fat reduction subject body mass index ( BMI ) 28 . Up 60 healthy subject enrol . All subject undergo assessment general health . During treatment period , subject 's fat thickness circumference measure three successive UltraShape contour I V3 treatment perform ( two week interval ) . Subjects undergo treatment UltraShape contour I V3 use U-Sculpt/VDF transducer abdomen area . Follow-up ( FU ) visit conduct follow : 4 week FU , 8 week FU 12 week FU post last treatment ( Tx.3 ) . Subject 's fat thickness circumference measure visit . Subject 's blood test take baseline ( prior first treatment , pre Tx.1 ) , third treatment ( pre Tx.3 ) 12 week follow-up visit ( 12wk FU ) . `` No Pregnancy '' verify first treatment well . In follow visit ( TX2 , Tx3 FU 1 FU 2 FU3 ) , lack pregnancy verify question . Additionally , subject satisfaction investigator satisfaction questionnaire complete FU visit . Finally , photography perform visible light condition front , right leave view . Optional , 3D photograph take visit ( treatment visit , prior treatment ) .</detailed_description>
