	<brief_summary>After standard multimodal therapy , prognosis relapse unresectable high-grade osteosarcoma dismal unchanged last decades.Thus , investigator explore apatinib activity patient relapse unresectable osteosarcoma failure first-line second-line chemotherapy . Patients &gt; 14 year , progress standard treatment , eligible receive 500 mg 750 mg apatinib daily progression unacceptable toxicity . The primary end point progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4 month . Secondary objective PFS , overall survival ( OS ) , clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , define progression 4 month safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apatinib Advanced Osteosarcoma After Failure Standard Multimodal Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Eligible patient follow characteristic : age &gt; 16 year ; diagnosis high-grade osteosarcoma confirm histologically review centrally ; prior treatment ( complete &gt; 4 week trial entry ) consist standard high-grade osteosarcoma chemotherapy agent include doxorubicin , cisplatin , high-dose methotrexate , ifosfamide ; metastatic relapse unresectable progressive disease ( PD ) ; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 life expectancy &gt; 3 month ; adequate renal , hepatic , hemopoietic function . Additionally , investigator require normal control blood pressure , well surgery and/or radiotherapy completion least 1 month enrollment . All enrol patient show radiological evidence disease progression lesion could evaluate accord RECIST 1.1 treatment start . Treatment Patients plan treat dose apatinib 500 mg ( BSA ≤1.5 ) 750mg ( BSA &gt; 1.5 ) daily . The dose reduce temporarily suspend accord predefined rule consider observed toxicity , assess accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 3.0 . Following adverse event resolution , apatinib restart maximally tolerate dose continued progression , unacceptable toxicity patient refusal . The study approve participate hospital review board , conduct accord Declaration Helsinki International Conference Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guideline . Each patient provide write informed consent . Efficacy Assessment Before start treatment , patient stag chest abdomen compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( whenever indicate clinical situation ) . And patient test Immunohistochemistry VEGFR-2 over-expression paraffin embed sample lesion mRNA test VEGFR-2 over-expression fresh specimen . Baseline assessment include also full blood count , serum chemistry , electrocardiogram physical examination . In light potential role osteosarcoma response assessment , [ 18F ] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) suggest mandated patient enrollment , impact tumor response assessment purely exploratory . All test repeat 2 month , thereafter , 2-month interval unless toxic effect disease progression suspicion . Response assess CT/MRI scan accord RECIST 1.1 . Thus , complete partial remission need confirmation within 4 week response first demonstrate . Stable disease ( SD ) confirm minimum 8 week . The investigator thoroughly probe record sign ( ) treatment-induced improvement , minor response ( MR ) tumor shrinkage &lt; 30 % , and/or nondimensional tumor response include Hounsfield unit measure tissue density change osteoid matrix calcification . The primary end point progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4 month calculate date treatment start time disease progression death , whichever come first . Patients alive free progression would censor . Secondary end point include follow : PFS ; OS ; overall response rate , define complete response ( CRs ) + partial response ( PRs ) + MRs ; disease control rate ( overall response rate + SDs ) ; pattern nondimensional response ; clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) ( PFS rate 4 month ) duration response . Duration response calculate day first response assessment either progression/death ( event ) last day follow-up ( censor ) . Last , investigator evaluate clinical improvement mean Pain Analgesic Score via Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) score form fill patient . Analgesic medication use record accord analgesic score : 0 = none ; 1 = minor analgesic ; 2 = tranquillizer , antidepressant , muscle relaxant steroid ; 3 = mild narcotic ; 4 = strong narcotic .</detailed_description>
