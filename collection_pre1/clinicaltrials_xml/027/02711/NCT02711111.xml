	<brief_title>Effect Bone-anchored Protraction Maxillary Growth Young Child</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Class III malocclusion may originate retrognathic maxilla , prognathic mandible . Young patient class III malocclusion maxillary hypoplasia conventionally treat protraction facemask reverse twin block appliance order stimulate forward growth upper jaw . This treatment option often induce unwanted side effect include mesial migration teeth upper jaw clockwise rotation mandible . Because skeletal effect often difficult achieve approach , pronounced class III malocclusion address face mask therapy . These child treat childhood end major orthognathic surgery full-grown age . To able treat also pronounce class III malocclusion minimize dentoalveolar compensation new treatment method develop us skeletal anchorage . In maxillary deficiency case 's common deficiency anteroposteriorly well transversely . Opening midpalatal suture rapid expansion correct transverse hypoplasia may produce anterior movement maxilla . The propose technique enable start skeletal anchorage treatment earlier age , also potential growth modification treatment . Objective : To compare new technique skeletal traction incorporation maxillary expansion conventional treatment protocol . Study design : This RCT Study population : Healthy human volunteer ( 7- 14 yr old ) class III malocclusion due maxillary deficiency . Intervention : The intervention consist application mentoplate ( anchored screw bone ) low jaw two screw upper jaw ( palate ) . Expansion upper jaw achieve classic Hyrax appliance , connect screw . Anterior movement maxilla subsequently accomplish intermaxillary elastic traction mentoplate . Control group ( conventional treatment ) : Anterior movement maxilla accomplish elastic traction face mask Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter difference amount forward growth upper jaw mid-face ( measure cone beam CT ) compare growth observe conventional treatment . A cone beam CT make start traction therapy ( baseline ) 1 year therapy evaluate amount expansion forward growth maxilla . One last cone beam CT produce end growth , 5 year start orthodontic traction , evaluate long-term stability obtain advancement . Other end-points patient ` satisfaction complication-rate .</detailed_description>
