	<brief_summary>optimize functional outcome early phase gait rehabilitation subacute incomplete SCI patient use rTMS additional treatment physical therapy ( e.g . gait train Lokomat® ) . Using add-on therapeutic strategy , expect large improvement gait function physical therapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Gait Improvement Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive painless procedure modulate cortical excitability motor area induce change descend corticospinal output . This modulation may useful promote active recovery motor function obtain functional benefit gait rehabilitation . Through use repetitive high-frequency rTMS , improvement report motor sensory function measure American Spinal Cord Injury Association ( ASIA ) Impairment Scale ( AIS ) , time complete peg-board task four chronic incomplete cervical SCI patient . Physical therapy aim improve function undamaged also , far possible , damage neuronal structure . However , 'reorganization ' neuronal circuit target specific training approach . Therefore , challenge guide CNS plasticity order optimize functional outcome give individual . Hypothesized high-frequency rTMS couple gait training improve motor recovery low extremity locomotion incomplete SCI patient great degree sham stimulation .</detailed_description>
