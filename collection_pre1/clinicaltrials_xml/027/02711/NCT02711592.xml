	<brief_summary>The objective study see pain management outcomes effect pharmacogenomic testing use determine patient specific pain medication dosing . Our goal determine use analgesic genetic testing , TKA post-operative patient see decrease narcotic consumption , postsurgical opioid- related adverse reaction , length stay , overall NRS pain score maintain improve satisfaction score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics Information Enhancing Post-operative Total Joint Replacement Pain Management : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study look pain management effect pharmacogenomic test utilized select dose narcotic pain medication prescribe breakthrough pain post-operative total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) patient . Patients receive individualized analgesic dos pain mitigation base genetic testing result . Post op pain score , narcotic consumption , adverse reaction , length stay patient satisfaction pain management collect analyzed determine significance pharmacogenomic analgesic testing . Due lack literature evidence surround pharmacogenomics use select analgesic control post-operative pain pilot study conduct evaluate effect size ( statistical variability ) attempt predict appropriate sample size large scale randomize control trial . The subject enrol data collect internal pilot use large scale parent study well .</detailed_description>
