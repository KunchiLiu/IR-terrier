	<detailed_description>The world medical science replete plethora condition physiological pathological exhibit manifold symptom , man conquer others , still wag relentless battle . In fast changing world stress cut throat competition , human often resort tension relieve habit like alcoholism , smoking , tobacco betel nut chew . Apart severe systemic consequence habit , oral cavity also adversely affected . Of unique oral affliction habit oral cavity betel quid chewer , Oral Submucous Fibrosis ( OSMF ) hold pivotal position . OSMF distress condition due limit open oral cavity , patient neither able consume normal diet maintain proper oral hygiene . OSMF mostly occur Asian country , include India , China , Pakistan , Sri Lanka Bangladesh , chew betel quid ( areca nut , tobacco , slake lime , specie ) popular &amp; accepted form tradition part country . It observe irritant like betel nut , tobacco etc . keep long period around cheek swallow gradually may play major part causation disease . In India , first mention disease literature date back time 'Sushruta ' 'Vidari ' . However modern literature 'Schwartz ' 1952 first describe `` Atrophica idiopathica mucosa oris '' . Oral submucous fibrosis `` insidious , chronic disease affect part oral cavity sometimes pharynx . Although occasionally precede and/or associate vesicle formation , always associate juxta-epithelial inflammatory reaction follow fibroelastic change lamina propria , epithelial atrophy lead stiffness oral mucosa cause trismus inability eat '' Usually disease patient disabling symptom early phase , progress cause burn sensation , difficulty eat open mouth , force patient report clinician distressing symptom . Sharp ( 1956 ) describe submucous fibrosis along epithelial hyperplasia mucosal atrophy characteristic feature abnormal-precancerous oral epithelium tissue adjacent frank oral cancer . OSMF transform oral cancer , particularly squamous-cell carcinoma , rate range 7 % 13 % . OSMF occur decade life commonly see 2nd -4th decade life . Various study suggest multifactorial origin disease high incidence associate consumption areca nut . Reduction preferably stoppage habit form essential component total treatment plan . The mainstay treatment OSMF therefore concentrate upon improve mouth open relieve symptom either medicinal surgical mean . The medicinal treatment mild case OSMF include steroid , cardiovascular drug , antioxidant , vitamin iron supplement . Topical application steroid , hyaluronidase , collagenase , placental extract yield positive result mild case advance case , surgery follow aggressive physiotherapy viable treatment produce satisfactory result . Excision fibrous band prop mouth open allow secondary epithelialisation cause rebound fibrosis healing . Release fibrous band split thickness skin graft high recurrence contracture . The survival full thickness skin graft questionable . The use island palatal flap base great palatine artery recommend Khanna et al . limitation include involvement donor site fibrosis , limited donor tissue limit reach flap , need extraction maxillary second molar cover defect flap tension . The bilateral tongue flap cause severe dysphasia , disarticulation , carry risk postoperative aspiration . They also provide limited amount donor tissue reach inadequate . The stability tongue flap dehiscence common postoperative complication uncontrolled tongue movement . Apart report involvement tongue 38 % , precludes use reconstruction . Buccal fat pad may also use cover defect excision fibrous band . The harvest buccal fat pad simple access easy . However , severe atrophy buccal fat pad see patient chronic disease . In addition , anterior reach buccal fat pad often inadequate , region anterior cuspid require leave raw . This raw area heals secondary intention subsequently fibrosis , lead gradual relapse . Bilateral radial forearm free flap hairy , 40 % patient require secondary debulking procedure , facility free tissue transfer universally available . Canniff Harvey recommend temporal myotomy coronoidectomy release severe trismus cause atrophic change tendon temporalis muscle secondary disease . The use nasolabial flap reconstruction head neck defect prove efficacious reliable . The versatility flap attribute fact often abundant non - hair bearing skin well vascularized region . Also proximity defect achievement good cosmetic result preservation function least distortion anatomy make flap choice . Therefore , advantage 'extended single stage nasolabial flap ' treatment OSMF lead u carry study `` Evaluation change mouth open centimeter oral submucous fibrosis patient surgical excision fibrous band along bilateral coronoidotomy &amp; surgical defect coverage single stage nasolabial flap '' . Mouth open centimeter record pre operatively ( base line ) , 1 week,2 week,3 week,4 week , 2nd month,3rd month 6 month post operatively change record .</detailed_description>
