	<brief_title>Efficacy Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation Hand Paralysis After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator evaluate effectiveness robotic-assisted motion activity additional physiotherapy ( PT ) occupational therapy ( OT ) , stroke patient hand paralysis . A randomized controlled trial . The experimental group receive passive mobilization hand robotic device Gloreha control group receive PT OT 3 consecutive week ( 3 days/week ) addition traditional rehabilitation . Outcomes include National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) , Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) , Barthel index ( BI ) , Motricity index ( MI ) , short version Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( quickDASH ) , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) measurement . All measure collect baseline end intervention ( 3 week ) .</detailed_description>
