	<brief_summary>Intracranial Pressure ( ICP ) monitor essential component traumatic brain injured ( TBI ) patient management . The clinical sign raise ICP may unreliable may reflect relatively late cerebral decompensation . ICP may monitor invasive non invasive technique . While invasive technique show real time value ICP , associate many complication like , intracranial bleeding infection , occlusion catheter tip blood , debris difficult locate ventricle presence cerebral oedema . All drawback invasive method avert employ non invasive technique ICP monitoring . Although show real time value excellent tool detect presence absence raise ICP . Elevated ICP detect Computarised tomographic scan ( CT ) Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , techniques time consume require transportation patient may unstable .The quick non invasive nature ultrasonography fast become popular rapid detection elevate ICP bedside emergency ICU monitoring optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD ) . Its limitation notwithstanding , ultrasonographic ONSD monitoring likely reliable clinical assessment diagnosis intracranial hypertension especially , patient sedation precludes proper clinical examination . Therefore , recent year , among non invasive method , bedside ocular ultrasonography monitor ICP gain popularity . Carbon dioxide potent modulator cerebral vascular tone , alters ICP change size cerebral vasculature thereby , cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) action occur rapidly , e period minute . In range PaCO2 20mmHg 80 mmHg cerebral blood flow change linear manner . End tidal carbon dioxide concentration ( EtCO2 ) surrogate measure PaCO2 ( especially haemodyanimically stable patient healthy lung ) routinely monitor continuously patient subject general anaesthesia . To date little literature effect change EtCO2 ONSD . This prompt u conduct study find effect different level EtCO2 ONSD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter Response Various Levels End Tidal Carbon Dioxide Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study monitor effect three different EtCO2 level ( 40mmHg,30mmHg 50mmHg ) . In healthy patient observe rapid response ONSD change EtCO2 . This highlight fact optic nerve direct communication brain , pressure change latter reflect ONSD . The alteration ONSD immediate response EtCO2 change , moreover , change ONSD parallel EtCO2 change . Since CBF cerebral blood volume change response change PaCO2 , ONSD also change accordingly . Over year , advancement monitor ICP enable diagnosis elevate ICP reliably non-invasive techniques.Optic nerve sheath diameter measurement use bedside ultrasound show correlate clinical radiologic sign symptom raise ICP . Despite association ONSD PaCO2 , scanty literature ONSD responsiveness dynamic surrogate PaCO2 , EtCO2 . The pertinent advantage EtCO2 PaCO2 measurement former continuously monitor anesthesia avoids time consume process arterial blood gas sampling . Moreover , sensitivity ICP even small fluctuation EtCO2 report literature . Animal study estimate rate increase ONSD 0.0034mm/mmHg increase ICP . The ONSD small ( 0.29cm ) EtCO2 30mmHg , big ( 0.40cm ) EtCO2 50mmHg intermediate ( 0.34cm ) EtCO2 40 mmHg . These change ONSD direct representation change ICP bring change CBF due PaCO2 change . Based result Bland Altman plot , calculate 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) difference two measure ( EtCO2 40mmHg 30mmHg ) ONSD 0 . 009 0.102 calculated CI difference two measure ( EtCO2 40mmHg 50mmHg ) ONSD 0.152 0 . 29 thus observe statistically insignificant . Recently Kim et al study ONSD responsiveness two level EtCO2 ,40 50mmHg , measure 1 5min observe significant change diameter ONSD . Thus result variance study . Various possibly reason difference finding Kim et al study small number patient oppose relatively large sample size study . Also use total intravenous anesthesia combine propofol remifentanil infusion . This combination likely predispose patient systemic hypotension turn would increase ICP cause cerebral vasodilation . Other possibility different result may sonographic measurement ONSD may vary observer 's skill even type ultrasound device . According available literature , upper limit ONSD use define ICP 20mmHg ( raise ICP ) range 0.48 0.57 cm . In study , upper limit ONSD EtCO2 level 50mmHg average 0.40cm implies even EtCO2 50mmHg , intracranial hypertension remote possibility healthy non-neurosurgical patient normal brain compliance . We keep constant factor position patient , time measurement achieve target EtCO2 , measure ONSD single plain ( transverse ) involve experience operator , ,thereby , avoid confound factor .</detailed_description>
