	<brief_title>Comparison Post-operative Complications Bone Augmentation Anterior Maxilla After Periosteal Releasing Incision With Two Techniques Diode Laser Scalpel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guided bone regeneration ( GBR ) well establish method augment excessive alveolar bone loss time implant placement . Primary closure soft tissue prerequisite successful bone augmentation procedure . Adequate flap advancement key factor tension free primary wound closure . The tension free flap usually attain incise buccal flap use scalpel . However , procedure , especially case major flap advancement , result increase patient morbidity surgery . Swelling hemorrhage first week surgery negative effect patient 's quality life . Currently , lasers widely use tool soft tissue management diode laser appear effective tool incision excision soft tissue . The major advantageous property laser ablation tissue together effective hemostasis , minimal swell virtually pain .</detailed_description>
