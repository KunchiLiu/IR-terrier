	<brief_summary>Treatment celiac disease ( CD ) lifelong strict gluten-free diet ( GFD ) . Patients followed-up dietary interview serologic test CD marker ensure adherence diet . However , none method offer accurate measure dietary compliance . Our aim evaluate measurement gluten immunogenic peptide ( GIP ) stool marker GFD adherence CD patient compare traditional method GFD monitoring . We perform prospective , non-randomized , multicentre study include 188 CD patient GFD 73 healthy control gluten-containing diet . Subjects give dietary questionnaire fecal GIP quantify ELISA ( iVYLISA GIP-S kit ) . Serological anti-tissue transglutaminase ( anti-tTG ) IgA anti-deamidated gliadin peptide ( anti-DGP ) IgA antibody measure simultaneously .</brief_summary>
