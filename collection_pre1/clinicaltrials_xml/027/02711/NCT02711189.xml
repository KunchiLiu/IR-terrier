	<brief_summary>Background : Oxytocin naturally occur substance body . Studies show oxytocin may affect body respond alcohol . Researchers believe oxytocin may possible treatment alcoholism . Objective : To test whether hormone oxytocin affect brain reward system . To see affect people respond alcohol reward thing life like food see love one . Eligibility : Men age 21-55 alcohol use disorder . Design : Participants two 6-day inpatient study visit . They : - Study medication placebo give twice daily nasal spray . - Height weight measure . - Medical history . - Blood urine test . - Breath test alcohol . - Electrocardiogram . - An alcohol administration session . In bar-like room , participant consume four alcoholic drink . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The MRI scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide cylinder . A device call coil place head . Participants complete task computer screen . - In another alcohol session . drink alcoholic beverage answer question . Participants get tab eight drink ( $ 3.00 per drink ) . They may drink drink take money . Participants hold smell glass water favorite alcoholic drink . - Heart rate blood pressure monitor . - Saliva sample collect - Computer task questionnaire . About one week end visit 2 , participant return clinic follow-up visit . Symptoms side effect evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : There compel evidence support neuropharmacology oxytocin ( OT ) warrant investigation potential therapeutic agent addiction . To end , link OT dopaminergic pathway , respect motivate behavior drug social reward , important establish mechanism . Although preliminary clinical finding suggest role OT treat withdrawal alcoholic individual , direct human evidence effect OT administration dopamine release . Additionally , direct human evidence effect OT subjective response alcohol . There study investigate differential effect , , OT , neurobehavioral response various reward stimuli include alcohol , food social reward . We propose , therefore , investigate whether intranasal administration OT able significantly reduce subjective response alcohol , alcohol cue-induced crave self-administration , well examine neural response social , alcohol food stimulus . Study Population : 32 ( 24 completers ) male Alcohol Use Disorder ( AUD ) define DSM-5 non-treatment seeker AUD . Design : A within-subject , double-blind placebo-controlled study investigate effect intranasal OT response alcohol challenge , cue reactivity alcohol self-administration , neural response reward stimulus . Outcome measure : ) effect OT subjective response cumulative alcohol challenge , cue reactivity alcohol self-administration ; b ) neurobehavioral response social , alcohol food stimulus . Outcome measure : A ) effect OT subjective response cumulative alcohol challenge , cue reactivity alcohol self-administration ; B ) neurobehavioral response social , alcohol food stimulus .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 2155 year old male subject . Justification : woman include due : 1 ) confound estrogenmodulating effect OT ; 2 ) need control menstrual cycle phase across repeat day study procedure would significantly limit feasibility study Must meet DSM5 criterion AUD base SCID Right hand EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Nondrinkers ( alcoholnaive individual current abstainer ) . Currently seek treatment reduce stop alcohol use . Current diagnosis substance use disorder nicotine determine DSM5 . Current clinically significant major depression anxiety ; lifetime diagnosis schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder . Lifetime history suicide attempt . Contraindications MRI scanning , include metal body contraindicate MRI ( implant , pacemaker , prosthesis , shrapnel , irremovable piercings ) , lefthandedness , claustrophobia unable lie comfortably supine 2 hour MRI scanner determine history physician examination MRI safety form . BMI &gt; 40 Investigators determine subject body shape preclude acquisition adequate MRI scan . Unable provide negative urine drug test ( UDT ) . Medical contraindication : Current clinically significant disease , include CNS , seizures , cardiovascular , hypertension , arrhythmia , glaucoma , respiratory , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , endocrine , reproductive disorder determine history clinical exam screening . Specifically , unstable hypertension , clinically significant EKG abnormality , GFR rate &gt; 60ml/min , liver cirrhosis , AST ALT &gt; 3X upper normal limit , hemoglobin &lt; 10.5 g/dl . Participants significant alcohol withdrawal symptom define CIWAAr &gt; 8 . History alcohol relate seizure Requirement use past two week psychoactive medication ( four week fluoxetine ) . Use prescription OTC medication know interact alcohol within 2 week study . These include , may limit : isosorbide , nitroglycerine , benzodiazepine , warfarin , antidepressant amitriptyline , clomipramine nefazodone , antidiabetes medication glyburide , metformin tolbutamide , H2antagonists heartburn cimetidine ranitidine , muscle relaxant , antiepileptic include phenytoin phenobarbital codeine , narcotic include darvocet , percocet hydrocodone . Drugs known inhibit induce enzyme metabolize alcohol use 4 week prior study . These include chlorzoxazone , isoniazid , metronidazole disulfiram . Coughandcold preparation , contain antihistamine , pain medicine antiinflammatories aspirin , ibuprofen , acetaminophen , celecoxib naproxen , withhold least 72 hour prior study session . History hypersensitivity oxytocin . Clinically significant electrolyte abnormality , current rhinitis use vasoconstricting medication prostaglandin Head trauma loss consciousness 30 minute . Any individual colorblindness would prevent complete Stroop task . Any reason Investigators determine best interest participant take part research .</criteria>
