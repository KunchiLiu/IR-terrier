	<detailed_description>Introduction rationale study : Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) commonly complicate acute illness intensive care unit ( ICU ) . This syndrome associate high morbidity mortality . In management ARDS patient , lung protective ventilation prone ventilation key strategy show survival benefit recent year become standard part care patient . Prone position used surgery operation room report ocular complication , vision loss one devastating complication . Multiple risk factor report orbital compression prone positioning , excess intravenous fluid , hypotension duration prone position predominant factor . Perioperatively patient , underwent prone position surgery follow symptoms complication surgery , follow symptom difficult intensive care unit patient prone ventilation , able communicate . The hour prone ventilation nearly 3-4 time , compare intra-operatively definitely increase intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) significantly . Most patient hemodynamically unstable vasopressor support , unlike intra-operatively , significantly affect ocular perfusion pressure ( mean arterial pressure - intra-ocular pressure ) , make ICU patient definitely high risk ocular complication . The purpose study evaluate effect prone position IOP critically ill patient follow ocular complication among survivor . Tonometry guide IOP measurement one commonly use modality ass IOP . It use assess IOP prone position awake volunteer document increase IOP within hour prone position operating table It study anesthesia elevate IOP significantly increase IOP dependent eye . Primary objective : • To evaluate effect prone position intraocular pressure ( IOP ) critically ill patient acute respiratory distress syndrome . Secondary objective : • To follow survivor detailed ophthalmological examination anterior posterior segment eye . Work plane methodology : Prospective observational study conduct Department Critical Care Medicine , SGPGIMS , Lucknow Institutional Ethics Committee approval . Consent patient 's family member obtain . All adult patient ARDS plan prone ventilation , decide treat physician , screen inclusion study . As part standard treatment ARDS , patient receive lung protective ventilation strategy per ARDS net protocol appropriate sedation paralysis , also patient relevant invasive non-invasive vitals monitor per ICU protocol . All IOP measurement take investigator throughout study , train monitor IOP ten patient direct supervision experience ophthalmologist . In studied patient , baseline reading IOP measure tonometry device prone position 30-45 degree head end elevation ( T1 ) . Next reading IOP measure ( T2 ) , 5 minute supine position , i.e . preparation turn patient prone . Then , patient proned adequate precaution avoid ocular compression rest body support adequate thoraco-pelvic support . Duration prone ventilation decide treat physician . The next IOP measure non-dependent eye 10 minute ( T3 ) 30 minute ( T4 ) prone position ; make patient supine ( T5 ) . After completion prone position session , IOP measure eye 5 minute turn patient supine without head end elevation ( T6 ) , follow measurement 10 minute ( T7 ) , 15 minute ( T8 ) 30 minute ( T9 ) . Last 3 measurement i.e . T7 , T8 T9 do 30-45 degree head end elevation . All IOP value record mean three reading pre-defined time , eyes patient . Monitored vitals relevant clinical data note . Patient follow till ICU discharge . Detailed ophthalmic examination anterior segment ( include IOP measurement ) ; posterior segment eye do survivor time ICU discharge well 1 month 3 month , follow . Sample size calculation : Sample size calculate use minimum 95 % confidence interval 95 % power study one group observation take six time repeat design . Assuming 0.28 standard deviation effect size mean difference , calculate sample size come 23 . Finally study , sample size take 25 . PASS-8 ( Power sample size ) software version 8 used calculate sample size . Data Collection : Demographic relevant clinical characteristic include patient collect structured proforma . ICU prognostication score , i.e. , Acute Physiologic Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II score Sequential Organ Dysfunction Assessment ( SOFA ) also record . Duration prone ventilation well position head ( right leave side turn ) also note . IOP measure eye pre-defined time interval . Detailed ophthalmic examination finding collect among survivor time ICU discharge 3 month follow . Intervention : Nil . All patient manage per ICU treat team 's decision</detailed_description>
