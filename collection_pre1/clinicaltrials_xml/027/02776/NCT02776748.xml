	<brief_summary>The purpose study quantify magnitude extent infant exposure daily emtricitabine ( FTC ) /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) via maternal breastmilk take pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) lactate HIV-uninfected woman . The primary outcome steady state concentration emtricitabine tenofovir infant plasma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PrEP Breastfeeding Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , short-duration , open-label , single-arm , repeat-dose , pharmacokinetic study daily FTC/TDF PrEP among HIV-uninfected lactate mother-infant pair . PrEP administer woman daily directly observe therapy 10 consecutive day - sufficient reach steady-state discontinuing thereafter . No drug administer infant directly . Co-formulated FTC TDF dose 200 mg daily 300 mg daily , respectively . The overall goal quantify magnitude degree breastfeeding infant expose FTC/TDF use PrEP HIV-uninfected lactate woman . Maternal blood breastmilk sample obtain concurrently ( i.e. , within 30 minute ) regardless time food intake ( i.e. , non-fasting ) 7th 10th day . Peak sample obtain 1-2 hour maternal directly observe PrEP trough sample obtain end dose interval ( i.e. , 23 24 hour directly observe PrEP dose ) . A single infant blood sample obtain maternal 7th directly observe PrEP dose . We conduct quantitative measurement analyse infant plasma drug concentration , infant-plasma breastmilk breastmilk maternal plasma drug concentration ratio characterize FTC TDF transmission breast feeding infant . Tenofovir emtricitabine concentration plasma breastmilk quantify via previously validate liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric ( LC-MS/MS ) method accordance recommendation include US Food Drug Administration , Guidance Industry , Bioanalytical Method Validation guideline .</detailed_description>
