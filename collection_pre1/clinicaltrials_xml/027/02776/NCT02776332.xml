	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine duration manual expression affect milk volume level breastfeed self-efficacy mother premature infant . The specific aim study determine duration manual expression mother premature infant result : ( ) increase breastfeed self-efficacy ( b ) difference milk volume ( c ) correlation breastfeed self-efficacy milk volume .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Manual Expression Breast Milk One major contribute factor cessation breast feeding premature population infant decrease milk production . Because premature infant unable initially fee breast , artificial method maintain milk supply manual electric pump expression explore . Studies Flaherman et al . Slusher et al . use randomized design address manual versus pump expression effect milk volume . Flaherman et al . study population 68 full-term infant feed poorly breast two month delivery United States academic medical center randomize mother either manual expression electric pump expression . Slusher et al . allocate mother 65 premature infant admit African special care nursery manual expression , manual power pedal pump electric pump six-ten day delivery . Both study find electric pump yield high volume milk manual expression . Slusher et al . find statistically significant increase milk volume electric pump compare manual expression ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . No mean difference demographic three group find . Flaherman et al . also report high milk volume electric pump comparison fail reach statistical significance ( p=0.07 ) . Although fail reach statistical significance milk volume , Flaherman , follow participant two month report high rate continue breastfeed among mother initially use hand expression ( p=0.02 ) . In addition , Flaherman measure self -efficacy use Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form ( BSES-SF ) baseline , one week , one moth two month delivery . However , significant difference group breastfeed self-efficacy . Two study investigate combination manual electric pump expression . Morton combine hand expression electric pump whereas Ohyama use manual expression electric pump expression . In study Morton ) prospective observational design use examine milk production eight week delivery mother instruct use electric pump manually express much possible first three day post-partum particular sequencing . In sample 67 mother premature infant , Morton able find increase milk production two week mother hand express great five time day ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Ohyama also study mother premature infant Japanese neonatal intensive care unit use crossover design study combination manual electric pump expression technique . The mother sequentially allocate either manual electric pump expression alternate method seven session complete method . Net milk yield significantly high manual expression ( p &lt; 0.05 ) compare pump expression first 48 hour delivery . Both study support potential benefit manual expression early removal colostrum prior onset mature milk . A pilot feasibility study use combine sequence manual pump expression intervention first three day delivery conduct mother premature infant whose infant hospitalize NICU propose study population set . Mothers premature infant ( n=6 ) ask staff nurse intra-partum post-partum unit perform manual expression prior electric pump expression first three day delivery record milk volume breastfeed log three week delivery . Women begin initial expression within six hour delivery initially exclude , base previous literature state longer delay time delivery expression serve important variable overall milk production . Due infeasibility woman able begin first pump session within six hour delivery due complication delivery logistical issue within healthcare setting , inclusion criterion recruitment extend six hour 24 hour delivery . The intervention manual expression able deliver mother study thus provide important information feasibility teach intervention population mother . However , half mother study able complete log , revision amount duration study variable large study consider . Limitations Previous Studies Manual Expression Of study review , three address premature infant two randomized trial thus causation difficult establish . There conflict evidence whether electric pump expression manual expression yield high milk volume standard sequence method always employ research design . All study report relatively low sample size fail mention use power analysis lead Type I error . Most study focus physiological outcome primary measure incorporate theoretical framework . The study base physiological theory early frequent pump expression delivery essential maintain milk supply mother may separate infant infant feed poorly . Despite mixed result previous study become standard practice many hospital instruct mother manual expression result recommendation Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative ( BFHI ) . The BFHI global initiative endorse WHO United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) whose primary goal assist mother able successfully initiate sustain breastfeeding . The BFHI recognize hospital successful meeting guideline breastfeed quality outcome . The number U.S. hospital apply BFHI certification increase since 2010 U.S. Department Health Human Services incorporate practice promote federal goal . As part BFHI global criterion , 80 % mother need report teach hand express milk mother feed breast mother separate baby . The duration manual expression define BFHI previous study incorporate manual expression measure many day manual expression may optimal . Of study review incorporated manual expression independent variable , combination electric pump expression . The duration manual expression vary across study ; anywhere three eight day delivery . As previously discuss , lactogenesis II mark onset copious milk secretion birth delivery placenta occur anywhere two eight day postpartum . Due variability mature milk create , time colostrum period may vary per individual . Comparing duration manual expression may reveal insight optimal time expression technique mother premature infant . No study review focused duration manual expression independent variable . This study first focus duration manual expression primary variable interest .</detailed_description>
