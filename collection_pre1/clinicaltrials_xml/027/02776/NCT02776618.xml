	<brief_summary>We recruit patient require excision skin cancer compare aesthetic functional difference suture repair excisional defect use polyglactin 910 v poliglecaprone 25 split-scar model . Excision sit either trunk extremity . Standard dermatological excision repair method use removal lesion repair wound surgeon ; training course use limit inter-surgeon variation technique . Excisional defect repair deep polyglactin 910 suture , follow randomly assign subcuticular closure one half defect polyglactin 910 suture half poliglecaprone 25 suture . The patient follow-up 6 month fill patient self-assessment evaluation survey scar . Photographs also take scar follow-up 6 month , assign set blind observer evaluate wound use modify Patient Observer Self-Assessment Scale ( mPOSAS ) . These observer rate scar mPOSAS scale value average observer . Total duration participation 6 month , 2 total visit ( excision visit follow-up visit ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening : Patients recruit study need excision cutaneous malignancy determine biopsy . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion ( please refer section 11.1 ) offer elliptical excision repair standard care ( surgeon 's choice closure entire surgical wound ) enrol study . Patients recruit directly PI and/or co-investigators , typically telephone biopsy result cutaneous malignancy need treatment excision convey . Occasionally patient 's may recruit directly in-person subsequent office-visit occur patient physician . Patient 's enroll study undergo intervention excision repair time convenient , ideally within one month . Intervention : Patients undergo medically-necessary elliptical excision cutaneous malignancy use standard excision protocol . This occur similar time frame standard excision cutaneous malignancy clinic range 1-4 week diagnosis , base patient 's preference schedule . The wound divide half designate side A ( either leave superior aspect ) side B ( either right inferior ) . Side A wound randomly assign subcuticular closure either poliglecaprone 25 polyglactin 910 . Side B receive opposite side A. Randomization perform online randomization software ( http : //www.randomizer.org ) . Prior placement superficial subcuticular suture , side wind receive vertical deep sub-epidermal suture use polyglactin 910 . Patients blind material use side . After wound close , de-identified photograph take PI co-investigators wound demarcation sit A B ( use surgical pen ) serve marker side A side B future identification intervention site . The type randomize intervention site A site B record without identify patient information secure , encrypt database . Closed wound treated standard protocol pressure bandage leave place 24 hour follow daily treatment petrolatum ointment bandage 2 week epidermis heal together completely . Patients counsel standard wound care well common complication standard excision surgeon . No visit suture removal necessary suture dissolvable . *note - interventional method patient include study consider standard therapy . Patient 's would still receive similar excision closure wound participate research . Follow-up : Patients call via telephone either PI co-investigators 2 week inquire heal process assess complication . Patients follow 6 month schedule routine skin cancer surveillance exam surgeon perform excision . At time , surgeon re-identify sit A B surgical marking pen . A de-photograph take excision site scar . At end patient visit , patient personally give POSAS patient survey ask rate scar sit A B ; identify information include survey . In case scar location patient easily visualize , de-identified photograph patient 's scar print patient ass scar . Photographs later assign two blinded observer assign modify observer POSAS score subject ' scar . These score average analyzed difference .</detailed_description>
