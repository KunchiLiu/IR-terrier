	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop algorithms help predict future injury and/or re-injury return duty musculoskeletal injury . After completion episode care physical therapist , subject undergo battery physical performance test fill associate survey . The subject follow year identify occurrence/re-occurence injury . Based performance physical evaluation test , algorithms derive use regression analysis predict injury . Subjects recruit pool patient recently complete physical rehabilitation physical therapy clinic low extremity lumbar/thoracic spine injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Models Spine Lower Extremity Injury After Discharge From Rehab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit across 4 medical center complete regimen physical therapy spine low extremity injury . Upon discharge back full duty , give opportunity enroll study undergo battery physical performance test associate survey . The subject follow year identify occurrence injury . Prediction algorithms derive use regression analysis predict injury base performance physical evaluation test . The overall hypothesis Service Member performance battery physical performance test perform upon discharge care return duty , able predict 1 ) risk sustain injury well 2 ) reoccurrence injury seek care year follow discharge rehabilitation . The current assumption Service Member discharge medical care , do base expectation appropriate safe return function operational environment . Because history prior injury well-established risk factor , every single Service Member return duty medical care musculoskeletal ( MSK ) injury already high risk future injury non-injured counterpart . The investigator hypothesize decreased performance propose test protocol related increase risk 1 year-injury recurrence injury . Successfully identify increase risk recurrence provide ability secondary tertiary prevention program optimize return duty rate . Injury define new musculoskeletal injury re-occurrence injury 1-year surveillance period . The battery physical performance test include : Selective Functional Movement Assessment ( SFMA ) , Functional Movement Screen ( FMS ) , Upper Quarter Y-balance Test ( YBT-UQ ) , Lower Quarter Y-balance Test ( YBT-LQ ) , Closed Kinetic Chain Dorsiflexion ( CKC DF ) , Single Hop Test , Triple Hop Test , Triple Crossover Hop Test , Carry Test , un-weighted weight 300 yard Shuttle Run Test . Each subject also contact monthly via SMS ( Short Message Service , e.g . text message ) survey follow year identify information additional injury profile may sustain prior period time . Information injury also calculate patient chart review Department Defense healthcare utilization database ( claim data ) . This provide robust method capture data injury data regardless subject availability follow-up . Subjects dichotomize injured non-injured base injury surveillance data . Key demographic , physical performance ( FMS , YBT , SFMA , Hop Test , Carry test , &amp; Shuttle Run ) , self-report measure examine group difference . Potential predictor variable enter backward stepwise logistic regression model determine accurate set variable predictive musculoskeletal injury status . Risk stratification ( low , moderate , high ) base likelihood ratio ( LR ) associate clinical prediction rule injury outline . A positive LR &gt; 10 place individual high risk , LR 2 10 would place individual moderate risk . Those positive LR le 2 list low risk .</detailed_description>
