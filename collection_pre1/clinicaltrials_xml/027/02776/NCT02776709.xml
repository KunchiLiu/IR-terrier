	<brief_summary>Cholangioscopy , direct visualization bile duct first document late 1970s make many advance last decade . The advent mother-baby scope allow diagnostic therapeutic procedure , though early scope often fragile , cumbersome due need two endoscopists . Ultraslim endoscopes later become popular method digitally view bile duct , however , often need guide-wire balloon-assistance allow cannulation . Other disadvantage system include limited steerability , poor irrigation capability . The advent Spyglass , single-operator peroral cholangioscopy method allow fiberoptic , catheter-based system could easily use diagnostic therapeutic purpose biliary system . However , image quality often lack due fiberoptic technology . The new digital Spyglass system rectify inadequacy introduce digital sensor well image quality , allow good visualization diagnosis indeterminate stricture . Furthermore , modification scope platform allow efficient use , reliable directionality scope tip , improved ease passage accessory therapeutic procedure clear stone stent placement .</brief_summary>
