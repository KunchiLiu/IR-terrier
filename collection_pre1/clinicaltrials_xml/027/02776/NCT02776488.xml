	<detailed_description>Metabolic crisis state energy insufficiency due impaired mitochondrial function indicate cerebral microdialysis lactate/pyruvate ratio ( LPR ) . We perform safety analysis glucose sodium lactate infusion human demonstrate proof concept fuel alter brain metabolism . Animal TBI study demonstrate proof concept three candidate fuel . We conduct multicenter , adaptive design-based , proof concept unblinded phase 2 study 3 candidate supplemental fuel infuse 3 hour patient severe TBI undergo standard care multimodality monitor cerebral microdialysis . The three candidate fuel glucose , sodium lactate , beta-hydroxybutyrate , dose establish animal model . Infusions guide point care test achieve ideal blood concentration infusion infusion . This 5-year safety study use parallel intervention model 4 arm , open-label , non-randomized .</detailed_description>
