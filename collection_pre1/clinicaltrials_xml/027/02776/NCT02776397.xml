	<detailed_description>1.0 Background Clinical Significance 1.1 Introduction The incidence Diabetes Mellitus type 2 ( DM2 ) grow rapidly globally Singapore . The main cause increase morbidity mortality patient DM2 development microvascular macrovascular complication . Although strict glycaemic control proven reduce microvascular complication , evidence still lack regard macrovascular complication . Accelerated atherosclerosis lead cause increase mortality morbidity patient . It paramount importance ass novel target control atherosclerosis patient DM2 top conventional treatment . There unmet need find new target marker predict increased risk patient diabetes mellitus need consider alternative treatment top conventional target reduce risk high risk group patient . Patients DM2 increase risk atherosclerosis , also carry great extent disease burden . Endothelial dysfunction consider hallmark pathological insult inflict blood vessel . Hyperglycaemia affect mitochondrial , enzymatic , non-enzymatic pathway associate generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , lead decrease nitric oxide bioavailability endothelial dysfunction , commonly demonstrate reduced endothelium dependent vasodilatation increase plasma level endothelium derive regulatory protein . Moreover , DM2 patient compromise antioxidant defense form low level antioxidant enzyme alpha-tocopherol ( vitamin E ) , may impede adequate compensation increase oxidative stress . Another role oxidative stress mediate development atherosclerosis also demonstrate oxidative hypothesis . In model prominent target oxidative modification LDL molecule . Oxidised LDL recognize LDL receptor readily take CD36 scavenger receptor pathway macrophage lead appreciable cholesteryl ester accumulation foam cell formation . Oxidized LDL proinflammatory , cause inhibition endothelial NO synthetase , promote vasoconstriction monocyte adhesion , promote platelet aggregation thrombosis . Hp Phenotype Oxidative Tissue Damage The haptoglobin ( Hp ) protein antioxidant due ability neutralize oxidative activity haemoglobin ( Hb ) . In human , Hp characterise genetic polymorphism three structurally different phenotype ( Hp1-1 , Hp 2-1 Hp 2-2 result expression two different allele ( Hp 1 Hp 2 ) haptoglobin gene locate chromosome 16q22 . The protein product Hp2 allele inferior antioxidant compare Hp1 allele product . Hp 1-1 small molecule ( 86kDa ) well-defined structure , whereas Hp 2-1 characterise heteropolymers ( 86-300 kDA ) Hp 2-2 form large macromolecular complex ( 170-1,000 kDa ) . The function Hp bind free Hb release red blood cell , release blood natural turnover red blood cell . Free Hb capable cause considerable oxidative tissue damage result heme iron . However , whenever Hb release circulation immediately bind Hp extremely high affinity form Hp-Hb complex . This bind serf inhibit oxidative potential Hb prevent release heme iron Hb . Hp normally find blood 400-fold molar excess free Hb therefore Hp capable binding Hb release normal red blood cell turnover . Once Hb bound Hp rapidly clear blood stream via CD163 scavenger receptor express monocyte/macrophages , however , formation clearance Hp-Hb complex impair Hp 2-2 phenotype . Iron derive Hb catalyse number oxidative reaction inhibit Hp . 1 . Ferrous heme iron ( Fe2+ ) react hydrogen peroxide yield ferric Hb ( Fe3+ ) highly reactive hydroxyl radical specie . By abstract hydrogen atom polyunsaturated fatty acid , hydroxyl radical may initiate process lipid peroxidation . 2 . Ferrous Hb ( Fe2+ ) also react hydrogen peroxide produce ferryl Hb ( Fe4+ ) , highly unstable molecule readily react second molecule hydrogen peroxide yield ferric Hb ( Fe3+ ) superoxide anion . The damaging effect superoxide anion two-fold : reduction ferric iron ( Fe3+ ) Hb ferrous iron ( Fe2+ ) , allow production additional hydroxyl radical describe reaction 1 , dismutation superoxide anion produce hydrogen peroxide , promote production ROS . 3 . Ferric Hb ( contain Fe3+ ) , also know methaemoglobin , spontaneously transfer heme moiety result heme entry diverse lipophilic environment LDL cell membrane . Once intercalated new lipid environment , heme iron undergo reaction hydrogen peroxide describe adjacent lipid peroxide generate free radical cascade lead extensive lipid oxidation . As part Hp-Hb complex , Hp stabilize heme heme pocket Hb , prevent Hb cause oxidative injury . However , degree Hp neutralize redox activity heme iron differs among Hp type . This show number system vitro vivo . For example , study use linolenic acid show Hp 1-1 prevent oxidation ( diene formation ) measure increase absorbance 232 nm great extent Hp 2-2 . Another study examine LDL oxidation due heme transfer Hb LDL . Heme transfer measure quench fluorescence signal emit dansylated LDL . It find Hp 1-1 superior prevent heme transfer Hb compare Hp 2-2 . Hp Phenotypes Cardiovascular Risk Studies show Hp 2-2 Hb complex also clear less efficiently non Hp 2-2 Hb complex . In DM2 patient phenomenon pronounce due downregulation CD163 , particularly Hp 2-2 individual . An impairment anti-inflammatory macrophage signal CD163/pAkt /IL-10 axis also see Hp 2-2 patient . Hp-Hb deficient clearance Hp 2-2 DM2 individual result increase Hp-Hb bind Apo A1 high-density lipoprotein ( HDL-C ) , thereby tether pro-oxidative heme moiety HDL . This render deficient ability reverse transfer cholesterol macrophage . The Hp 2-2 protein less efficient block heme transfer Hb compare Hp 1-1 . Furthermore , increase heme transfer Hb glycosylated may provide mechanistic explanation increase cardiovascular disease see Hp 2-2 DM2 . Hence Hp 2-2 phenotype associate decreased ability bind Hb , decrease clearance Hp 2-2 Hb complex , impairment anti-inflammatory signal pathway , increase LDL oxidation , render HDL-Cholesterol inefficient less efficient block heme transfer Hb Hp 1-1 lead high cardiovascular risk . In diabetes patient pathway also affect synergetic effect hyperglycaemia haptoglobin phenotype exacerbate lead high risk . In longitudinal study do population , see Hp 2-2 genotype associate 2-5 fold increase risk incident CVD individual DM . In particular strong heart study odds ratio CVD DM Hp 2-2 phenotype 2-5 time great DM Hp 2-1 phenotype ( p=0.002 ) . In Munich Stent study consecutive series 935 treat diabetic individual follow one year stenting major adverse cardiac event . In study haptoglobin 2-2 phenotype see independent predictor major adverse cardiac event . In addition see vitamin E provide substantial cardiovascular benefit Hp 2-2 DM patient one population ( Israel-ICARE STUDY ) post-hoc analysis WHS ( Women Health Study , ) HOPE study see whether Vitamin E supplementation subgroup patient haptoglobin 2-2 phenotype influence mortality show non-significant reduction total mortality . This widely adopt large trial , multiple population , need substantiate association benefit . Hp Phenotype Ethnicity In local study do Singapore , see frequency Hp gene vary different ethnicity follow : Chinese Hp1:0.330 ; Hp2:0.670 ; Hp0 : 0.029 ; Malays : Hp1:0.298 ; Hp2:0.702 ; Hp0:0.004 ; Indians Hp1 : 0.167 ; Hp2:0.833 ; Hp0:0.009 . The distribution Hp frequency see Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population hence expect prevalence Hp 2-2 around 30-40 % . The Hp phenotype determine TaqMan analysis TTSH Research Laboratory . 1.2 Haptoglobin genotype endothelial function Endothelial dysfunction receive increase attention potential contributor pathogenesis vascular disease DM . In DM2 , natural delicate balance release contract relax factor endothelium alter contributes vascular end-organ damage . Impaired endothelial function postulate provide final common pathway multiple risk factor exert deleterious effect cardiovascular health establish powerful surrogate marker cardiovascular risk one study show even well predictability Framingham risk score . The EndoPAT 2000 device use establish estimation endothelial function non-invasive manner . There direct study do look association Hp genotypes endothelial function , one pilot study wherein endothelial function assess use post-ischemic reactive hyperaemia strain gauge plethysmography express maximal flow ischemic period , see Hp 2-2 patient diabetes bad endothelial function compare non Hp 2-2 patient ( 450 +-50 versus 600+-40 ) . 1.3 Haptoglobin genotype CIMT ( Carotid intima medium thickness ) In Diabetes Heart study , genetic analysis Hp genotype show association Hp 2-2 genotype carotid intima medium thickness ( CIMT ) . These measurement make subject lying , head extend slightly turn opposite carotid examine , follow recommendation Mannheim CIMT consensus.Two investigator estimate CIMT 23 individual Bland-Altman plot plot limit inter-user agreement find within -0.1 +0.1 . 1.4 Haptoglobin genotype aortic artery stiffness Although direct study do compare Hp genotype aortic artery stiffness , one study do wherein evaluate arterial elasticity large small artery use pulse wave contour analysis method . The large artery elasticity index lower patient Hp 2-2 compare Hp 1-1 ( 8.4 +-2.3 ml/mmHg versus 12.6 +-4.1 ml/mmHg x 100 ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) . In study small artery elasticity index also significantly low patient Hp 2-2 phenotype . Increased vascular stiffness see early course Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 use sphygmocor device . It likely stiffness relate endothelial dysfunction rather structural vascular alterations-this turn suggest reversible . Aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , measure aortic distensibility , also see predict mortality patient diabetes independently know confound factor . The SphygmoCor Xcel device estimate aortic artery stiffness use carotid femoral pulse wave velocity central aortic pressure use . The investigator estimate pulse wave velocity 20 individual order establish limit agreement use Bland-Altman plot start study . 1.5 Haptoglobin genotype vascular marker Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) proteins expressed surface activate endothelial cell ( ECs ) express early atherosclerosis . These marker evaluate consider good marker endothelial dysfunction part protein shed circulation detect peripheral plasma . 1.6 Haptoglobin genotype phenotyping plasma lipid Hp 2-2 phenotype associate high oxidised LDL concentration , primarily involve atherosclerosis . The concentration Apo-A1 HDL also know high group patient . Hp 2-2 phenotype may also associate high Lp ( ) concentration put patient higher cardiovascular risk . Detailed phenotyping plasma lipid use proteomics look novel association do . 1.7 Haptoglobin genotype Oxidative Stress It know Hp 2-2 genotype confers higher oxidative stress endothelium . The total oxidative potential calculate Oxidative-INDEX . Two test do follow calculate index . This index establish good estimate overall oxidative stress . 1. d-ROMs test : This test perform serum sample use automated d-ROMs method . ( Vassalle C , Pratali L , Boni C , Mercuri A , Ndreu R. An oxidative stress score combined measure pro-oxidant anti-oxidant counterpart patient coronary artery disease . Clin Biochem 2008 ; 41:1162-7 ) 2 . FRAP ( ferric reduce ability plasma - measure ability plasma prevent damage vessel ) d-ROMs ( derivative Reactive Oxygen Metabolites ) test use calculate oxidative stress score . Other marker oxidative stress also measure glyoxal , methylglyoxal , asymmetric dimethylarginine homoarginine . 1.8 Haptoglobin genotype retinal Arteriovenous index The presence retinal microvascular abnormality especially arterial constriction venular dilatation associate increase cardiovascular risk associate endothelial dysfunction inflammation.Currently study look relationship Hp genotypes retinal arteriovenous ( AV ) index . . Prior investigation , eye drop instilled dilate pupil fundus examination lubricate cornea . Retinal image do subject eye clinic . If patient wish participate retinal imaging , may choose opt retinal imaging test . 2.0 Vitamin E , haptoglobin phenotype cardiovascular risk reduction While functional difference Hp1 Hp2 allelic protein product particularly DM explain difference susceptibility complication Hp 2-2 individual non Hp 2-2 individual , main reason unique benefit vitamin E redox active Hb associate HDL Hp 2-2 DM individual . In patient DM decrease Hp-Hb complex result increase Hp-Hb binding Apo-A1 high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , thereby tether pro-oxidative heme moiety HDL . HDL Hp 2-2 DM individual deficient ability stimulate reverse transfer cholesterol macrophage . Besides , Hp phenotype 2-2 associate increase oxidative stress due deficient clearance free radical increase LDL peroxidation . Vitamin E potent antioxidant anti-inflammatory property . It significantly alleviate condition oxidative stress potent free radical scavenging property interact directly strongly antioxidant enzyme . Vitamin E supplementation human animal model show decrease lipid peroxidation , superoxide production decrease expression scavenger receptor ( SR-A CD36 ) particularly important formation foam cell . Although vitamin E proven useful reduce cardiovascular risk general population , useful patient Hp 2-2 phenotype DM , condition increase oxidative stress substantially study do one population . There three interventional randomize control trial ( RCTs ) antioxidant DM participant receive vitamin E Hp type study participant determine . The ICARE study RCT aim evaluate vitamin E DM patient Hp genotype prospectively collect . In study , 1,434 DM individual &gt; = 55 year age Hp 2-2 phenotype randomise vitamin E ( 400 IU/day/placebo ) . The primary composite outcome significantly reduce individual receive vitamin E ( 2.2 % ) compare placebo ( 4.7 % , p=0.001 ) 18 month initiation trial terminate . Additionally , blood sample subset patient recruit WHS HOPE study analyse Hp polymorphism , outcome reassess accord patient 's Hp type . In study , high risk cardiovascular event see Hp 2-2 individual benefit vitamin E supplementation see group . 2.1 Justification dose duration vitamin E ( alpha-tocopherol ) . We use vitamin E 400 IU per day match placebo . We commission company Beacons prepare vitamin E capsule ( 400 IU ) match placebo capsule . Vitamin E preparation natural tocopherol occur RRR-configuration . We give vitamin E 400 IU 6 month study use surrogate marker cardiovascular risk see improvement 6 month supplementation . Moreover , ICARE study mention improvement cardiovascular outcome see 18 month thus suggest 6 month adequate duration see improvement surrogate marker cardiovascular risk . The eight form vitamin E divide two group ; four tocopherol four tocotrienols . They identify prefix alpha- ( α- ) , beta- ( β- ) , gamma- ( γ- ) , delta- ( δ- ) . alpha-tocopherol abundant form nature , know high biological activity base fetal resortion assay reverse vitamin E deficiency symptom human . Natural tocopherols occur RRR-configuration . The synthetic form contains eight different stereoisomers call 'all-rac'-α-tocopherol . Vitamin E find natural form vegetable oil ( wheat germ , sunflower , safflower , corn soybean oil ) , nut ( almond , peanut hazelnut ) , seed ( sunflower seed ) , green leafy vegetable ( spinach broccoli ) fortify breakfast cereal , fruit juice , margarine spread . The institute Medicine recommend intakes individual 15mg/day . The high safe level vitamin E supplement adults 1,500 IU/day natural form vitamin E , 1,000 IU/day man-made ( synthetic ) form . Popular vitamin E supplement available include , D-alpha tocopherol derive natural oil . Commercially available vitamin E supplement usually contain alpha-tocopherol provide either unesterified ester acetate , succinate nicotinate . In human , free esterify alpha-tocopherol bioavailability . Supplements contain either natural RRR-or synthetic ( all-rac ) alpha-tocopherol . The biological activity natural RRR alpha-tocopherol higher synthetic all-rac-alpha-tocopherol natural form vitamin E. Both oxidative stress individual genetic makeup contribute vitamin E homeostasis human may responsible variable clinical effect see improvement clinical variable clinical trial . Vitamin E absorb intestine , enters circulation via lymphatic system absorb together lipid , pack chylomicron transport liver . After passage liver , alpha-tocopherol preferentially appear plasma form vitamin E preferentially metabolise either secrete bile take excreted faeces . In liver , hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein ( α-TTP ) specifically sort α- form 2R-stereoisomers . Plasma RRR-α-tocopherol incorporation saturable process . Plasma level RRR-α-tocopherol cease increase approximately 80 μM despite increase dosage vitamin E supplementation 1,320 mg all-rac-α-tocopherol per day . This likely secondary rapid replacement circulate newly absorb α-tocopherol kinetic analysis demonstrate entire pool α-tocopherol replace daily . In human , preferential accumulation α-tocopherol body dependent upon functional α-TTP increase metabolism excretion non-α-tocopherols . The alpha-tocopherol transfer protein regulate whole-body distribution concentration vitamin E control secretion vitamin E liver . It see expression alpha-tocopherol transfer protein gene induce oxidative stress hypoxia , agonist nuclear receptor PPARα RXR , increase cAMP level . This mediate already present transcription factor call cAMP response element-binding ( CREB ) transcription factor . Single-nucleotide polymorphism commonly find healthy people drastically affect promoter activity . Various dos vitamin E range 400 IU 2,000 IU use clinical trial . The institute medicine , USA suggest recommend dietary intake ( RDA ) 15-1,000 mg/day ( 1 mg =1.5 IU ; 22.5-1,500 IU/day ) . We use dose 400 IU six month . There evidence adverse effect take within RDA , However may haemorrhagic toxicity high dos especially patient anticoagulant . Hence exclude patient anticoagulant . 3.0 Statistical Considerations 3.1 Sample size calculation : The overall estimated sample size study 300 patient . The required sample size 100 Hp phenotype stratum RCT phase base : 5 % type I error ; 90 % power ; assumption vitamin E expect least moderate effect , represent standardized effect size ( mean difference/pooled-standard error ) 0.5 , risk marker ; two sample t-test equal variance ; 15 % drop rate . Assuming 35 % prevalence Hp 2-2 population , need screen 300 patient recruit 100 Hp 2-2 phenotype patient . Assuming mean difference RHI 0.25 unit correspond standard deviation ( SD ) 0.3 - yielding standardized effect size 0.25/0.3 = 0.83 minimal difference RHI see another study . We adjust multiple testing/comparisons due pilot nature RCT , well exploratory nature study general . The sample size vitro study constrain limited resource . Nevertheless , simulation result base two-sided Wilcoxon Signed-Ranked test , 5 % type I error , correlation pair 0.5 , 5000 Monte Carlo simulation sample indicate 20 pair provide adequate power detect moderate large standardized effect size ( M1 ) . Randomisation do electronically web - centralize password-protected intranet website ensure patient randomised moment eligible trial ( strictly sequential ) . A blocked randomisation schedule employ , block 10 , study base 1:1 allocation ratio . The dedicated password-protected site allocate unique patient trial number correspond treatment number label medication box . Following randomisation , first dose administer patient . 3.2 Data handle statistical analysis : Data Handling All relevant collect use appropriate well-designed study data-collection form visit telephone follow assessment . All study data store study database assessable data entry data validation study personnel . Statistical Analysis Plan Data baseline demographic clinical variable well risk marker summarize Hp phenotype overall provide insight potential association . Binary data summarize use frequency proportion . Chi-square test Fisher exact test use evaluate relevant association ( include benefit vitamin E ) , necessary logistic regression use characterize association adjust potential confounders . Continuous variable summarize use mean ( standard deviation ) median ( range ) deem appropriate . Two sample t-test Mann-Whitney test use evaluate relevant association generalize linear model use characterize association adjust potential confounders . Generalized linear model consider accommodate non-normal ( asymmetric ) data log-normal data ( laboratory data ) necessary . Separate test model perform relevant outcome . Data vitro study summarize similarly describe precede paragraph , Hp 2-2 phenotype status vitamin E concentration . Wilcoxon Signed-Ranked test use evaluate benefit vitamin E Hp phenotype group concentration . Mann-Whitney Jonckheere-Terpstra test use evaluate concentration-benefit relationship vitamin E Hp phenotype group . Generalized linear mixed model employ explore various trend association account ( ) match Hp 2-2 non Hp 2-2 patient , ( ii ) repeat assessment within patient vitamin E concentration , ( iii ) adjust potential confounders , ( iv ) adjust potential non-normality ( asymmetry ) data use appropriate distribution log-normal gamma distribution . An overall analysis data vitro study do . Bland-Altman analysis use estimate evaluate limit agreement agreement reliability study . Where appropriate , mixed model approach use estimate evaluate relevant reliability coefficient . 5.0 Clinical Significance If association see Hp 2-2 phenotype cardiovascular risk , group patient target vitamin E treatment top statins conventional treatment reduce cardiovascular risk . Future large scale nation-wide RCT plan see whether vitamin E treatment help reduce risk group patient . Conducting study multi-ethnic population imperative provide insight consistency generalizability expect benefit .</detailed_description>
