	<brief_summary>Background : Drug resistant tuberculosis serious public health problem threaten health human life development society economy . At present , diagnosis drug-resistant tuberculosis mainly depend traditional drug susceptibility test . But limited Mycobacterium tuberculosis slow growth speed , traditional solid drug sensitivity test usually need 3 month result , delay development drug resistance patient effective treatment . Probe melt curve resistance detection technology recent emergence new molecular biology drug resistant tuberculosis detection technology , probe melt curve different fluorescent label probe coverage detection specific M.tuberculosis drug resistance determine region , change melt point probe hybridization , acquire mutation information detection region , shorten detection time detect nonuniform resistance . In study , select nationally representative different level hospital jointly launch multi center , large sample clinical assessment , complete comprehensive evaluation sensitivity , specificity health economics drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis , especially resistance multidrug extensively drug-resistant TB patient detection , order evaluate rapid , accurate economic appropriate technology drug resistance pulmonary tuberculosis detection . In order accomplish overall goal project , framework overall design , accord principle core task divide four sub topic , namely : Sub topic 1 core mission include 3100 case smear positive pulmonary TB suspicious symptom , select 1000 case drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis patient , use MGIT liquid culture drug sensitivity test gold standard , evaluate sensitivity specificity probe melt curve detction resistance four kind anti tuberculosis drug Mycobacterium tuberculosis ; Sub topic 2 core task include least 500 case culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis patient treatment follow-up , use MGIT liquid culture drug sensitivity test gold standard , evaluate application value probe melt curve monitor spectrum change drug resistance Mycobacterium tuberculosis pulmonary tuberculosis treatment . The core mission sub topic 3 project implementation hospital research site , acquire cost-effect evaluation analysis compare probe melt technology Mycobacterium tuberculosis MGIT liquid culture , drug sensitivity test xpert MTB/RIF technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sub topic 1 : Probe melt curve method analysis drug resistance detection technology detection Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance performance analysis . Research method : multi center clinical study . Research object : sputum acid fast stain microscopy positive pulmonary tuberculosis suspicious symptom . Technical principle operation method : see attachment . Entry criterion : 1 ) study smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis suspicious symptom ; 2 ) provide 3-4ml sputum sample three time 2 day ; 3 ) inform consent . Exclusion criterion : quality sputum specimen qualify ( sputum sample le 3ml saliva sputum ) . 1. sample estimate Method formula : accord national tuberculosis drug resistance baseline survey result , isoniazid , rifampicin , fluoroquinolones streptomycin anti tuberculosis drug , fluoroquinolones resistance rate low ; use fluoroquinolones detection estimation sample content , meet need anti tuberculosis drug resistance rate analysis . 2. observation index : ( 1 ) basic information : demographic data , underlying disease , diagnosis treatment tuberculosis , epidemiological characteristic . ( 2 ) clinical symptom sign : fever , night sweat , cough , sputum sputum , weight loss , hemoptysis sputum blood , chest pain , dyspnea , fatigue , height , weight , pulmonary rale . ( 3 ) chest imaging ( chest X-ray CT scan ) : specific description lesion distribution morphological characteristic score . ( 4 ) laboratory examination : erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , blood routine test , blood biochemistry ( AST , ALT , TP , ALB , BUN , Cr Glu ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . ( 5 ) microbiological examination sputum , sputum acid fast stain microscopy , MGIT liquid culture drug sensitivity detection , xpert MTB/RIF , probe melt curve technology . 95 % confidence interval , use statistical method chi square test Kappa test . sub topic 2 : follow diagnosis treatment application Probe melt curve method resistance detection patient pulmonary tuberculosis . Research method : multi center clinical study . Study subject sample size : MGIT liquid culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis patient sub topic 1 , include least 500 case . Entry criterion exclusion criterion : research sub topic 1 . 1 observation index : 1. clinical symptom physical sign diagnostic node change : fever , night sweat , cough , sputum sputum , weight loss , hemoptysis sputum blood , chest pain , dyspnea , fatigue , height , weight , pulmonary rale . 2. change chest image follow node : detail description image . 3. clinical examination diagnostic node : erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , blood routine test , blood biochemistry ( AST , ALT , TP , ALB , BUN , Cr Glu ) , C-reactive protein , . 4. diagnosis node sputum microbiology examination : sputum acid fast staining microscopy , MGIT liquid drug sensitive culture , Xpert-MTB/RIF probe melt curve . 5. classification outcome : 1. effective : complete prescribed course treatment , sputum culture negative ; chest X-ray absorption improvement ; 2. failure : treatment 6/8 month smear / culture examination positive / radiographic improvement ; 3. non tuberculosis death : death due cause tuberculosis ; 4. tuberculosis death : death due disease progression complication ; ( E ) shed : interruption treatment follow-up achieve ; ( f ) diagnostic change : diagnosis pulmonary tuberculosis treatment process . 6. change drug resistance spectrum ( ) drug resistance spectrum change : change drug resistance Mycobacterium tuberculosis course follow-up ; ( b ) uniform resistance : refers result original probe melt curve resistance detection technology analysis , find probe melt curve peak spectrum chart present characteristic two kind different genotype . 2.quality control acceptance : research sub topic 1 . 3 data statistic analysis : Probe melt curve , molecular diagnostic technique patient pulmonary tuberculosis treatment statistical method application diagnosis calculate two-sided 95 % confidence interval , chi square test kappa test . sub topic 3 : Probe melt curve technology cost-effect analysis detection drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Methods : use cost analysis method questionnaire . Research object : research project implementation hospital laboratory . Data collection , statistic analysis : 1 cost analysis 1. implementation follow basic data collection data entry software . 1. basic cost : collect implementation hospital basic input cost , include laboratory housing area , housing area office area , laboratory construction renovation cost , consider useful life housing , conversion housing cost per unit time . 2. laboratory equipment cost : experimental equipment cost purchase new price calculate cost include procurement cost associate , transportation , installation ; annual collection major equipment maintenance / repair cost , accord useful life instrument , convert instrument unit time cost . 3. laboratory management cost : laboratory water , electricity , garbage disposal fee , heat cost , etc . ; 4. personnel cost : laboratory staff wage , include bonus allowance pay employee ; ( E ) cost supply : laboratory , include glove , laboratory clothing , hat , conventional reagent , unit price ; ( f ) collection cost input software , basis implementation basic data hospital ; 2. selection opportunity cost method , three project implementation hospital laboratory independently collect nine laboratory personnel process time , use instrument , reagent , consumables number consumption , accurately record table statistic ; every collection cost shall cover high , medium low different sample size , average value 3 time amount sample ; collect data time consume product data entry form , different batch cost calculation , region three time cost take average value real-time fluorescent nucleic acid isothermal amplification detection technique detection unit . 3. analyze prevalence rate tuberculosis different project , calculate cost tuberculosis patient different region . 2 acceptance survey : design questionnaire , survey 3 project implementation hospital le 10 laboratory technician . The questionnaire cover convenience method , need laboratory , application prospect aspects content .</detailed_description>
