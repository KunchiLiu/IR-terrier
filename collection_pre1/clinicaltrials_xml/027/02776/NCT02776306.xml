	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect mirror box therapy upper extremity , motor recovery motor function patient suffer stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirror Box Imaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arm hand weakness result stroke occurs approximately 70 % stroke survivor , 30 % -60 % patient unable fully recover functional use upper limb . As recovery may due insufficient inadequate therapeutic intervention , progress evaluation upper limb treatment currently investigate . Mirror Box therapy task orientate , non-invasive , economic patient direct therapy hemiparetic upper limb post stroke patient . The study intend evaluate cerebral reorganization use mirror therapy . Movements strong limb trick brain thinking weaker arm move stimulate respective brain area . Patients enrol two group use standard upper limb rehabilitation three week follow standard rehabilitation plus Mirror Box another three week ( Group 1 ) . Group 2 receive therapy invert order . Patients receive clinical functional assessment baseline , three week six week include brain MRI use functional rest state MRI . The primary outcome functional connectivity ( correlation coefficient ) baseline treatment . Secondary endpoint include motor functional recovery use outcome measure like Fugl Meyer assessment , Action Research Arm Test , grip pincer strength . Further secondary endpoint increase sensorimotor cortex activation across period therapy cortical reorganization .</detailed_description>
