	<brief_title>A Gene Hunting Study Familial Papillary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim project identify genetic risk factor associate familial papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) . This accomplish several way , include loss heterozygosity study well comparative gene expression analysis . When possible , linkage analysis family multiple individual affect PTC may also help identify putative gene ( ) . Study participant ask : 1 . Complete family history medical history questionnaire 2 . Sign medical record release thyroid cancer pathology report obtain 3 . Supply blood sample genetic study 4 . Provide study related information family member need family study</detailed_description>
