	<brief_summary>The Libre- flash glucose monitoring system episodic real-time data demand device . This mean patient measure glucose level choose scan device , time sensor automatically measure continuously store glucose reading day night . Every scan show current glucose reading last 8 hour glucose . There alarm system require calibration . In present study aim evaluate treatment satisfaction comfort use Libre flash glucose monitoring system compare conventional Self Measurement Blood Glucose ( SMBG ) adolescents type 1 diabetes discontinue use continuous glucose monitoring . The second aim study evaluate rate use impact Libre use compare Self-Measurement Blood Glucose among adolescent sub-optimally control stop use Continuous Glucose Monitoring . The study investigator initiate study , single-center , randomize , parallel study 12 week optional cross-over 12 week extension period .</brief_summary>
