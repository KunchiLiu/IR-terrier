	<detailed_description>This joint endeavor Zambian Ministry Health ( MoH ) , Ministry Community Development , Mother &amp; Child Health ( MCDMCH ) Centre Infectious Disease Research Zambia ( CIDRZ ) funding Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation . The study evaluate four model streamline HIV care reduce patient ' time cost : ( 1 ) community adherence group ( CAG ) , ( 2 ) urban adherence group ( UAG ) , ( 3 ) Fast-Track clinic visit ( 4 ) streamline ART initiation ( START ) . CAG UAG assess use cluster-randomized design ; Fast-Track START use observational approach compare change outcome difference difference approach . 1 . Specific Objectives Objective 1 : To determine acceptability , appropriateness , feasibility differentiate care system Zambia , assess perspective ( 1 ) patient family member ( 2 ) health care worker ( 3 ) government local leader . Objective 2 : To evaluate effectiveness ( retention ) , efficiency ( cost-effectiveness ) , health care quality ( quantitative qualitative measure ) differentiate target care system . Objective 3 : To develop `` methodologic '' toolkit assessment local need , preference scale-up differentiate care model vary context , use data Objectives 1 2 . 2.0 Methodology 2.1 Objective 1 Mixed method approach use evaluate perception challenge access adhere life-long HIV treatment ass needs/preferences differentiate care model collect patient family member ( demand side ) , health facility -professional community health worker ( supply side ) , government local leader use in-depth interview ( IDIs ) , focus group discussion ( FGDs ) , discrete choice survey ( DCS ) sequentially analyze supply demand side factor may influence uptake . Population Key government stakeholder HIV relevant community base service delivery interview . Professional lay health worker ART program , Pre-ART ART patient , sample household member ART pre-ART patient register select health facility interview . Measurements/Procedures For Objective 1 : IDIs , FGDs , medical chart review , DCS/general survey Semi-structured guide participant type use conduct IDIs FGDs English local language ( Nyanja , Bemba , Tonga ) . Where permit , IDIs/FGDs audio-recorded transcription analysis . Participants reimburse travel . IDIs last 1 FGDs 1-2 hour . A cross-sectional survey use measure patient access psychosocial need . Access need assessed question appropriateness current clinic operating hour ; distance , cost , time reach clinic ; household income , asset , expenditure ; opportunity cost clinic visit . Patient cost related health care utilization , include transport , communication , food cost elicit . To assess psychosocial need , validate scale index measure stigma ( Revised Berger ) , depression ( PHQ-9 ) , alcohol consumption ( AUDIT-C ) , domestic violence apply . The survey administer language participant 's choice train survey enumerator use tablet take approximately 30-45 minute uploaded central database . The electronic clinical information system ( SmartCare ) utilize evaluate patient clinical need . Distribution clinical need assess degree immunosuppression entry care , frequency opportunistic infection treatment initiation , frequency `` ill '' versus `` healthy '' visit . DCSs use assess patient preference different , discrete characteristic various model community-based ART delivery . All possible combination key attributes/aspects community-based ART model number levels/options put subset divide block . Each participant ask one possible block 10 question . Analytic Approach Qualitative data import software manage qualitative analysis ( e.g . N-Vivo Atlas TI ) , iteratively cod cross-referenced survey data . Scale score may analyze use descriptive statistic linear regression modeling . For DCS , main effect plus two-way interaction different parameter estimate use nested logit framework . Sampling Approach/Sample Size Considerations The convenience sample consist 20 IDIs government community leader ; two FGDs professional HCW , Lay HCW family member from1 urban 1 rural clinic province ; 4 FGDs ART patient ( 2 urban 2 rural clinic ) province ; 2 FGDs pre-ART patient ( 1 urban 1 rural clinic ) Lusaka province . General survey : 1,600 patient ( 800 ART 800 pre-ART ) . A precision approach use calculate number ART pre-ART participant respectively necessary estimate binary indicator 5 % margin error 95 % confidence interval , assume prevalence p=0.5 design effect 2 [ n= ( ( 1.96^2 ) * 0.5* 0.5 *2 ) / ( 0.05^2 ) =768 ] . 2.2 Objective 2 : To evaluate effectiveness , efficiency , health care quality differentiate system care include target model care . Effectiveness differentiate system HIV care delivery frequency , type , intensity contact health system tailor patient need evaluate . CAGs , UAGs , fast-track , START simultaneously implement evaluated use common evaluation framework include effectiveness ( retention ) , efficiency , quality . Methodology A match cluster randomize design approach propose CAG UAG model account clinic-level intervention possible selection bias . With little observational/ implementation data Fast-Track START model globally , difference-in-difference design use calculate effect model outcomes . Population See inclusion exclusion criterion Procedures Description Interventions : Entered elsewhere Patient recruitment : At intervention site : Facility staff identify eligible patient routine clinic visit notify study research assistant potential study participant . The research study assistant ass patient willingness participate intervention obtain informed consent study participation . START model : Staff use national guideline determine ART eligibility , participant ' informed consent , expedite provision on-site CD4 test use point care platform newly diagnose ART-naive patient due routine CD4 monitoring . Participants actively follow 12-months ART initiation . At control site : Eligible patient control sit , willing join CAG UAG study , enrol . Consent obtain extract SmartCare data . Baseline viral load testing : For participant enrol CAG , UAG Fast-Track intervention , dry blood spot specimen obtain via finger prick . Specimens transmit CIDRZ central laboratory baseline viral load test . Results communicate provider patient , document SmartCare . Costing A subset participant model interview direct indirect health cost intervention use semi-structured questionnaire . Administrative data may also use . Exit viral load test patient exit-survey All participant exit viral load test 12th month . In CAG , UAG , Fast-Track model , patient exit-survey ass patient satisfaction patient centeredness . Measurements Standard de-identified socio-demographic , laboratory clinical data extract SmartCare . Information model-specific register ( attendance , receipt medication , symptom checklist , patient preference intervention standard care , up-referral due presence symptoms patient 's desire return standard care , down-referral model patient acute illness stabilize ) enter study database use tablet . Patient satisfaction centeredness capture semi-structured patient-exit survey conduct 12-month intervention period . Baseline exit viral load test conduct . A semi-structured costing questionnaire use subset intervention participant assess relate direct indirect health cost . To calculate resource use activity , time-in-motion study conduct among patient health care worker prior intervention . Process data collect facility-level assessment pharmacy stock out HCW interview end follow-up period . Analytic Approach For START , date ART initiation primary outcome . For CAG UAG intervention , Kaplan-Meier estimate time primary outcome , stratify intervention condition , use log rank test calculate . For Fast-track START , primary analysis take difference-in-difference approach estimate difference change rate outcome intervention setting . In secondary analysis primary outcome , long interval lateness comprise miss pharmacy visit ( 14 30 day ) well adjustment baseline patient characteristic explore along analysis use medication possession ratio ( MPR ) outcome metric retention incorporate frequency miss visit interval time return . Sample Size Considerations CAG/UAG : Program data suggest 65 % patient &gt; 7 day late pharmacy refill visit first year ART 95 % ( +15 % ) clinic . Assuming conservative match co-efficient variation 0.10 50 % reduction miss pharmacy visit , selection five clinic 90 patient per site yield power 96 % CAG intervention . Under conservative assumption clinic variability effect size , sample size yield &gt; 80 % power . For UAG intervention , target sample size 4 UAGs 30 people five intervention site ( 120 participant per site ; 600 across site ) . Under assumption CAG model , sample size yield power &gt; 90 % robust varying assumption correlation . Fast-track : Targeting 200 patient four site ( 2 intervention 2 control site ) , fall 40 % assume 80 % patient miss pharmacy visit first year , give 80 % power . START : Assuming ART initiation 2 week rise 60 % 85 % , 100 patient eight site ( 4 intervention 4 control site ; n=800 ) , rho 0.15 yield anticipated power 78 % . 2.3 Objective 3 : Methodological Toolkit After data synthesis , methodological toolkit develop guide assessment feasibility , acceptability , need , preference implementation differentiate care model . Data collect use work process track costing ; interview study staff key decision maker . The toolkit easily digestible lead actionable plan move current differentiate care model differ circumstance context . With input reviewer , toolkit finalize digital hard copy distribute dissemination event MoH , MCDMCH national sub-national stakeholder .</detailed_description>
