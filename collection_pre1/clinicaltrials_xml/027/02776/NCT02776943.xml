	<brief_title>UCMSC Transplantation Treatment Cartilage Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human cartilage limit regenerative potential . Transplantation umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell ( UCMSCs ) promise strategy give high proliferative capacity MSCs potential differentiate cartilage-producing cell - chondrocytes . The acquisition ucMSCs require invasive surgical intervention cartilage extraction site require cell-based strategy . The investigator inject allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell cartilage lesion patient via intra-articular injection method , investigate efficacy safety。</detailed_description>
