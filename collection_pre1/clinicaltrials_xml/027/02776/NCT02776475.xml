There data publish show patient fecal incontinence , symptom relief persist significant time period despite stimulator device turn . Based finding , potential exists prolong battery life patient cycle period device keep symptom stable . The typical battery life implantable pulse generator ( IPG ) approximately 5 year depend system setting . When IPG end battery life , new IPG must implant . The cost replace IPG range $ 13,952 $ 16,470 . IPG replacement must do operating room require patient undergo anesthesia associate risk . This study investigate whether symptom urinary urgency , frequency , urge incontinence remain stable patient SNM device turn period four week .
