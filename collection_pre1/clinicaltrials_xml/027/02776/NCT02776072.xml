	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate real-world clinical effectiveness , measure proportion participant relapse 12 month , participant treat dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) . Secondary objective study : To evaluate real-world clinical effectiveness , measure proportion participant relapse 12 month , participant treat DMF , glatiramer acetate ( GA ) , teriflunomide , fingolimod overall participant cohort subset participant naïve disease-modifying therapy ( DMT ) diagnose multiple sclerosis ( MS ) within 3 year start index therapy ; To compare relapse activity , define annualized relapse rate ( ARR ) , among participant treat DMF , GA , teriflunomide , fingolimod ; To compare MS-related hospitalization among participant treat DMF , GA , teriflunomide , fingolimod ; To compare intravenous corticosteroid use among participant treat DMF , GA , teriflunomide , fingolimod .</brief_summary>

Note : Patients initiated index therapy subsequently discontinue switched therapy allow study long least 12 month followup follow initiation index therapy . Have sufficient available medical record data abstraction meet objective study , i.e. , patient either medical care investigate site entire period index treatment patient 's complete MS disease treatment history otherwise available investigate site Key Diagnosis progressive form MS ( progressive relapsing , primary progressive , secondary progressive ) time period data collect Have receive diseasemodifying therapy one platform therapy ( IFN GA ) prior initiation index therapy . In patient GA index therapy , one prior IFN therapy allow .
