	<brief_summary>This first study GSK2982772 , receptor-interacting protein-1 ( RIP1 ) kinase inhibitor , subject active plaque-type psoriasis . The primary objective investigate safety tolerability repeat oral dos GSK2982772 ( 60 mg twice daily 84 day ) . In addition number experimental clinical endpoint employ obtain information pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , efficacy subject active plaque-type psoriasis ( PsO ) . After screen period 30 day , approximately 30 subject randomize receive either GSK2982772 placebo 84 day ( 12 week ) , follow follow-up period ( 28 day ) . The total duration study approximately 20 week screen last study visit .</brief_summary>

Subjects medical condition , active plaquetype psoriasis , opinion Investigator put subject unacceptable risk interfere study assessment integrity data . All medical condition must stable duration study . Presence active chronic plaquetype psoriasis determine Investigator least 6 month ( confirm subject medical record ) first dose study treatment ( Day 1 ) . Subject psoriasis plaque involve Body Surface Area &gt; =3 % assess screen dose Day 1 . Physician Global Assessment &gt; =3 . Subject must agree avoid prolonged exposure natural sunlight , tan bed phototherapy device duration study Subject least two stable plaque assess screen dose Day 1 : Both must suitable size ( &gt; =3 centimeter [ cm ] 3 cm ) one site suitable repeat biopsy , one site suitable index lesion PLSS scoring . Both plaque must PLSS lesional score &gt; =2 induration component ( moderate ) , &gt; =1 erythema scale total score &gt; =5 . The biopsy lesion must face , groin , scalp , knee , elbow , palmar/plantar surface hands/feet , must shield natural light clothing . Subject naive biologic therapy psoriasis , OR previous exposure single anti TNF biologic agent context previous clinical trial . The antiTNF biologic agent must discontinue 8 week prior screen visit ( 12 week 5 half life whichever longer first dose ) . A body mass index within range 18.535 kilogram ( kg ) /m^2 ( inclusive ) . Male Female subject : Males : Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply pre specify contraception requirement . Females : A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative serum urine human chorionic gonadotropin test ) , lactate , either nonreproductive potential reproductive potential . If reproductive potential , subject agree follow one option list per GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential 30 day prior first dose 30 day last dose study medication The Investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Capable give sign informed consent Subjects clinically overt concurrent psoriatic arthritis receive chronic diseasemodifying antirheumatic medication therapy ( nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ) , judge Investigator . Has nonplaque form psoriasis ( e.g . erythrodermic , guttate , pustular ) , judge Investigator . Has current druginduced psoriasis ( e.g. , new onset psoriasis exacerbation beta blocker , calcium channel blocker , lithium ) . Subject current history Suicidal Ideation Behaviour measure use Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale history attempt suicide . An active infection , history infection follow : Hospitalisation treatment infection within 60 day first dose ( Day 1 ) . Currently suppressive therapy chronic infection ( pneumocystis , cytomegalovirus , herpes simplex virus , herpes zoster atypical mycobacteria ) . Use parenteral ( intravenous intramuscular ) antibiotic ( antibacterial , antiviral , antifungal , antiparasitic agent ) within 60 day first dose . A history opportunistic infection within 1 year screening ( e.g . pneumocystis jirovecii , cytomegalovirus , pneumonitis , aspergillosis ) . This include infection may occur immunocompetent individual , fungal nail infection vaginal candidiasis , unless unusual severity recurrent nature . Recurrent chronic infection active infection , opinion Investigator might cause study detrimental patient . History tuberculosis ( TB ) , irrespective treatment status . A positive diagnostic TB test screening define positive QuantiFERONTB Gold test Tspot test . In case QuantiFERON Tspot test indeterminate , subject may test repeat , eligible study unless second test negative . In case QuantiFERON Tspot test positive , locallyread follow chest Xray , show evidence current previous pulmonary tuberculosis , subject may eligible study discretion Investigator medical monitor .

Alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2×upper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5×ULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5×ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) screening . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Current history renal disease estimate glomerular filtrate rate Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 . Hereditary acquire immunodeficiency disorder , include immunoglobulin deficiency . A major organ transplant ( e.g. , heart , lung , kidney , liver ) hematopoietic stem cell/marrow transplant . A planned surgical procedure , opinion Investigator , make subject unsuitable study . A history malignant neoplasm within last 5 year , except adequately treat cancer skin ( basal squamous cell carcinoma ) carcinoma situ uterine cervix fully treat show evidence recurrence . A history hypertrophic scar keloid formation , know allergy lidocaine local anaesthetic . The subject receive treatment specify therapy list protocol , change treatment , within specify timeframe . Other medication ( include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ) consider casebycase basis , allow opinion Investigator medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History alcohol drug abuse would interfere ability comply study . Subject intend sunbathe use tan device ( sun bed solarium ) within 14 day prior Day 1 completion follow visit ( Day 112 ) . History sensitivity study treatment , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion Investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Received live attenuate vaccine within 30 day randomization OR plan receive vaccination study completion followup visit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever long first dose study medication , plan take part another clinical trial time participate clinical trial .
