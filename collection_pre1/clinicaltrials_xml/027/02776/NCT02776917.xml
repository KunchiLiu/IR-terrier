	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety investigational drug call cirmtuzumab combination breast cancer drug paclitaxel . Cirmtuzumab type drug call monoclonal antibody . This drug design attach protein call ROR1 surface breast cancer cell . This block growth survival breast cancer cell . ROR1 rarely express healthy cell drug target cancer cell . Cirmtuzumab consider experimental use approve United States ( U.S. ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Although evidence test laboratory animal cirmtuzumab decrease number breast cancer cell , know work human . This drug test human , never test patient breast cancer , combination paclitaxel human . Therefore , goal study see cirmtuzumab safe tolerable , give combination paclitaxel study participant . You evaluate find effect ( good bad ) cirmtuzumab would like learn cirmtuzumab might affect growth cancer cell . We would also like see long drug stay body affect drug may body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Cirmtuzumab Paclitaxel Metastatic Locally Advanced , Unresectable Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , open-label , non-randomized , dose escalation study patient Her2 negative metastatic locally advanced , unresectable breast cancer previously receive paclitaxel metastatic setting . All patient provide informed consent screen eligibility . Baseline assessment include vital sign , physical exam , blood hematology chemistry , ECOG Performance Status evaluation , bone scan tumor assessment physical exam and/or CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis . Patients eligible proceed study participation ask provide optional tumor sample correlative study within 30 day prior study treatment initiation . Cirmtuzumab administer via intravenous infusion every two week ( i.e. , Day 1 Day 15 28-day cycle ) . Two dose cohort plan start dose 8 mg/kg 16 mg/kg . The 8 mg/kg dose test find safe patient CLL . Patients receive four dos cirmtuzumab unless patient exhibit disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administer weekly intravenous infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Patients may discontinue study treatment progressive disease , experience unacceptable toxicity , withdraw consent , treat physician determines 's best interest . Patients may also continue receive paclitaxel cirmtuzumab discontinue . Clinical evaluation history symptom , physical exam , vitals perform Days 1 15 cycle , blood draw laboratory work perform weekly treatment . Blood draws pharmacokinetics occur Days 1 2 Cycle 1 . Patients ask provide second optional tumor sample correlative study 15-30 day Cycle 2 Day 15 . An end treatment visit clinical evaluation safety assessment perform approximately 28 day last dose cirmtuzumab . Tumor response assess approximately 56 day last dose cirmtuzumab physical exam and/or CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis , bone scan applicable . A follow-up assessment adverse event occur approximately 84 day last dose cirmtuzumab .</detailed_description>
