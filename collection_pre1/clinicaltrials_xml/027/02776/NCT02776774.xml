	<brief_summary>There considerable interest use in-wound antibiotic ( IWA ) prevent infection spine surgery . An adequate evaluation IWA lack prior study limit confound bias . This prospective study enroll spine surgeon across country complete survey knowledge , attitude , practice use in-wound antibiotic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) spine surgery devastate complication . Spine SSIs occur many 40,000 people year , cause considerable disability result re-operative cost $ 100,000 . Even use standard perioperative infection prevention technique , SSIs occur often 3-5 % depend surveillance technique time-window use , widespread variability practice site surgeon . A mainstay SSI prevention timely administration antibiotic , one limit intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis bone tissue concentration antibiotic low blood level . As result , increase interest use in-wound antibiotic ( IWA ) , place directly spine completion surgery . IWAs support several observational study recent systematic review suggest 84 % decrease SSI . However , study fail address important confounding way IWA use variable follow-up . The IWA randomize control trial ( RCT ) , albeit underpowered fail identify protective effect , lead uncertainty role IWA . Because relative infrequency SSI , variable window follow-up high rate confound prior study IWA large scale trial IWA appropriate follow-up period need evaluate effectiveness spine surgery . Such trial would feasible randomization occur level hospital `` cluster '' ( cRCT ) , account exist variation practice regard IWA use , variable rate SSI , use SSI prevention technique . Several pilot feasibility question need addressed cRCT IWA propose . SSI appear long year spine surgery short follow-up time prior study may undercounted event may fail recognize SSIs may potentially delay detection IWA . For example , rationale surgeon use IWA , antibiotic type , dose unclear , whether surgeon use IWA similar fashion across patient sit represent confound researcher must account . It also unclear surgeon use IWAs relate knowledge exist data , belief attitude may barriers enablers trial promotes great use IWAs . To address issue direct eventual cRCT , investigator perform survey spine surgeon assess knowledge , behavior attitudes IWA .</detailed_description>
