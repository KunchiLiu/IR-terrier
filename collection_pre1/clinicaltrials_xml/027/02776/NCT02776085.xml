	<brief_title>Bedside Ultrasound Measure Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter Pediatric CSF Shunts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The particular interest study use ultrasound evaluate child 's optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD ) , size cover around nerve behind eye . This cover expand high normal pressure inside head . The group interest study focus child cerebrospinal shunt drain extra fluid head part body ( abdomen , heart , lung ) brain drain fluid like normal . When shunt malfunction fail , cause backup fluid brain , raise intracranial pressure ( ICP ) inside skull . Depending degree pressure buildup , surgical emergency due pressure brain . Currently , compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan use diagnose condition , quick screen tool , use ultrasound screen elevate ICP emergency department , would great benefit patient expedite care . Previous study explore use bedside ultrasound evaluate optic nerve sheath diameter child shunt . However , date , report prospective observational study compare ultrasound measurement ONSD patient shunt failure diagnose treat . Of note , study observational measurement take ultrasound machine use clinical decision making . The measurement study clinical impact patient care . The use ultrasound measure ONSD already accept application ultrasound .</detailed_description>
