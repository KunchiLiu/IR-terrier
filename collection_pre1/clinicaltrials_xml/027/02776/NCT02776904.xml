	<brief_summary>Previous work area concussion management focus heavily neuro-cognitive test . In addition routine neuro-cognitive test Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment Cognitive Testing ( ImPACT ) , pilot study design establish comprehensive battery clinical assessment utilization functional movement dynamic postural control assessment . The immediate application assessment focus male high school football player ( risk concussion ) . Our pilot study aim determine stability ImPACT test youth athlete light ongoing neurodevelopment population . In addition , pilot work implement additional tool focus assessment dynamic balance , reaction time , agility . This approach significantly enhance prediction subsequent musculoskeletal injury show occur concuss collegiate professional athlete believe also occur high school athlete . This battery test provide clinician invaluable information guide rehabilitation return play ( RTP ) decision concuss high school athlete . This pilot study track athletes sustain concussion ass increase risk musculoskeletal injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experiment 1 . Male high school football athlete ( n= 270 ) complete battery test include Star Excursion Balance Test ( SEBT ) , divide attention gait task , Psychomotor Vigilance Task ( PVT ) , Change Direction ( COD ) Illinois agility test ( IAGT ) . The SEBT establish , reliable outcome measure dynamic postural stability measurement low extremity reach distance . Our study also utilize force plate SEBT test allow investigator sensitively measure center mass plane . To test gait balance control adaptation gait strategy show impaired concussed individual acutely chronically , athlete walk self-selected speed GAITRite® portable gait analysis walkway three undivided attention trial three divide attention trial cognitive task , imposed.The GaitRite® calculate spatio-temporal parameter gait use concussion literature . The PVT reliable valid measurement simple reaction time auditory cue . The outcome measure mean reaction time . The COD IAGT valid reliable protocol ass agility male team athlete . This test yield completion time second . These test administer licensed physical therapist , assist student Doctorate Physical Therapy ( DPT ) PhD physical therapy program UCA , initiation summer 2016 two-a-day football practice athletes program . The total testing time per athlete exceed 1.5 hour . The battery administer athlete football program season end prior end school year spring 2017 . Experiment 2 . Qualified athletic trainer Physical Therapists , oversight Dr. Nesmith , administer ImPACT use schedule describe Experiment 1 . The ImPACT widely use neurocognitive test component standard three-prong approach concussion management also include symptom inventory static balance assessment . The computerized test evaluate concentration , attention , memory , visual motor speed , reaction time . High sensitivity specificity concussion use ImPACT show . The test also show valid reliable measure high school collegiate population . Composite score non-injured athlete stratify age examine change across three assessment . Hunt Ferrara show significant change baseline assessment 9th grade 11th 12th grade age group driven 9th grade test score indicate biennial test young adolescent may sufficient.The current recommendation young age group annual testing , though recent study call investigation even frequent testing , thus plan test six month . ImPACT test exceed 1 hour .</detailed_description>
