	<brief_title>Pressure Difference Between Brain Eye : Possible Cause Normal Tension Glaucoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference ( TLCPD ) , i.e . difference intraocular pressure ( IOP ) intracranial pressure ( ICP ) suggest pathophysiological component glaucoma . The theory high TLCPD , either due elevate IOP reduce ICP , cause glaucomatous damage . Normal tension glaucoma ( NTG ) patient find slightly reduce ICP measure horizontal position . However , previous study healthy adult volunteer investigator measure TLCPD supine , sit 9 degree head tilt position find TLCPD posture dependent , large difference upright position . Since human upright approximately two third day , one expect TLCPD diurnal perspective primarily influence ICP upright position . In study TLCPD different position patient NTG therefore measure . The study carry three part . 1 . TLCPD investigate simultaneous measurement IOP ICP . For IOP Applanation resonance tonometer ( ART ) , develop research group , use . ART independent gravitation possible use body posture . In study measurement perform supine , sit head tilt position . ICP measure continuously period body position change CELDA lumbar pressure measurement apparatus . 2 . Brain eye MRI investigation perform 3 Tesla GE scanner new generation 32-channels head coil . The image use measure cross-section area , blood flow velocity flow direction jugular vein , well structural property optic nerve optic nerve head . 3 . Ultrasound imaging , use high-resolution apparatus , perform study effect postural change blood flow velocity cross-section area right leave internal jugular vein external jugular vein .</detailed_description>
