	<brief_summary>The field genomics excite new field apply medicine . Its use treating cancer , sepsis burn patient promise . As knowledge genomics application microarrays expand , researcher develop intelligent way provide individualize care patient . The plan research study apply use genomics tool transplant several capacity . This research study design develop method isolate relevant cell type via microarray plate , extract mRNA sample cell type capture genetic profile . This do blood five healthy donor . Once ability demonstrate , next step use test several capacity transplant patient . The research study plan involve follow genetic profile 26 kidney transplant patient . One group follow prospectively start baseline , various set time point . A second group sample occurrence clinical event . These event include viral , bacterial , fungal infection , WBC &lt; 2.5 biopsy prove rejection episode normal graft function . Thus , intention study demonstrate immunosuppression alters expression genetic expression T cell . In , study provide good understand specific true immunosuppressed state give patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The two specific aim research study follow : 1 ) Proof concept two part . Firstly , study plan prove specific type T cell commonly involve immune response : CD3 , CD4 , CD8 population capture . These cell capture via microarray , lysed mRNA genomics map . The second part proof concept involve expose CD3 , CD4 CD8 population ex vivo various serum concentration tacrolimus - main cornerstone immunosuppressive medication solid organ transplant . Exposure three cell type various tacrolimus concentration demonstrate test detect mRNA transcript correspond , optimal immunosuppressed state . The quantify IL2 production three cell type various immunosuppressive condition measure . With 2 part first specific aim study , technique readily easily isolate cell population interest transplant patient capture cell population respond immunosuppression various concentration demonstrate . 2 ) The second specific aim research study run genomic profile kidney transplant recipient . For portion study , two cohort . A cohort identify `` prospective '' group cohort label `` event '' group . For prospective cohort , blood obtain patient specific time point . Specifically , blood sample obtain pre-transplant setting patient present hospital transplant , post-kidney transplant day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 7 ( +/- 1 day ) day 14 , 21 , 28 ( +/-3 day ) . Blood sample obtain month 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ( +/- 1 week ) . For second group , blood sample obtain time `` event '' , rejection , infection , etc. , apply series test blood . For group , blood draw do time 0 ( +/-1 day ) , one week ( +/-2 day ) , one , two three month ( +/-1 week ) post time 0 . There five blood sample collect per patient . For patient , comparison standard collect clinical information patient - graft function , rejection , infection , immunosuppression level - result transcriptomics . The culmination project involve reveal genomics specific type T cell precisely reflect patient 's true immunosuppressed state corresponding high , optimal low immunosuppressive clinical phenotype , thus allow transplant clinician intelligently accurately administer immunosuppressive medication . This study involve obtain blood sample kidney transplant patient time would otherwise blood collect standard clinical care . Consent obtain test blood , patient suffer additional pain inconvenience test . In coordination equipment supply currently use trauma critical care department 's research , investigator organize collection run labs time efficient minimally expensive way</detailed_description>
