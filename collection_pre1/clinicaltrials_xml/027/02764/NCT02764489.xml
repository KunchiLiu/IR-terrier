	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - 1 . To compare pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity ( FEIBA component Factor II ( FII ) safety FEIBA reconstitute reduced volume sterile water injection ( SWFI ) versus regular volume SWFI , administer standard infusion rate 2 U/min/kg - 2 . To evaluate safety infuse reduced volume FEIBA increase rate 4 10 U/min/kg comparison standard rate 2 U/min/kg</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Participant ≥ 18 ≤ 65 year old time screen 2 . Hemophilia A B severity , document &gt; 3 month history inhibitor require use bypassing agent ( FEIBA rFVIIa ) 3 . HCV negative ; HCV positive stable hepatic disease 4 . HIV negative ; HIV positive stable disease CD4 count ≥ 200 cell/mm^3 screen 5 . Adequate peripheral venous access 6 . Participant willing able comply requirement protocol 7 . If female childbearing potential , participant must negative blood pregnancy test agree employ adequate birth control measure duration study . 8 . If female nonchildbearing potential , must confirm screening . 1 . Known hypersensitivity FEIBA components 2 . Clinically symptomatic liver disease . 3 . Planned elective surgery participation study ( exclude minor procedure need preventative bleeding treatment , exchange peripherally inserted central catheter ) 4 . Platelet count &lt; 100,000/μL 5 . Clinical laboratory evidence disseminate intravascular coagulation 6 . Prior history evidence thromboembolic event : acute myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , etc . 7 . Diagnosis advance atherosclerosis , malignancy , and/or disease may increase participant 's risk thromboembolic complication 8 . Participant take immunomodulating drug ( e.g. , corticosteroid agent dose equivalent hydrocortisone &gt; 10 mg/day , αinterferon ) within 30 day prior enrollment except antiretroviral chemotherapy 9 . Herbal supplement contain antiplatelet activity 10 . Participant participate another clinical study involve investigational product ( IP ) investigational device within 30 day prior enrollment schedule participate another clinical study involve IP investigational device course study 11 . Participant family member employee investigator 12 . Clinically significant medical , psychiatric cognitive illness , recreational drug/alcohol use , opinion investigator , would affect participant safety compliance</criteria>
