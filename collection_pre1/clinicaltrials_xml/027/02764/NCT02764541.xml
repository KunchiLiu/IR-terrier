	<brief_title>Palbociclib Endocrine Therapy LObular Breast Cancer Preoperative Study ( PELOPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label phase II neoadjuvant clinical trial Palbociclib combination endocrine therapy hormone receptor positive early-stage breast cancer . The planned sample size 180 participant . The study include `` window treatment '' phase follow treatment phase . In window phase , participant treat two-week course tamoxifen ( Arm A ) letrozole ( Arm B ) . In treatment phase participant randomize receive endocrine therapy combination palbociclib ( Arm C ) endocrine therapy alone ( Arm D ) total duration 24 week . Premenopausal patient either invasive lobular ductal carcinoma eligible enroll directly treatment phase study . The study two co-primary objective : 1 ) To evaluate difference anti-proliferative activity letrozole versus tamoxifen measure change Ki67 baseline research biopsy ( day 15 ) within cohort hormone receptor positive breast cancer patient invasive lobular ductal carcinoma . 2 ) To evaluate pathologic complete response ( pCR ) endocrine therapy plus palbociclib endocrine therapy alone breast cancer patient diagnose hormone receptor positive invasive breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must Stage I III histologically confirm invasive carcinoma breast . A minimum tumor size least 1.5 cm determine physical exam imaging ( whichever large ) require . Patients must histologically confirm hormone receptor positive ( ER and/or PR ) , HER2 negative , invasive breast cancer . ER , PR HER2 measurement perform accord institutional guideline , CLIAapproved set US certified laboratory NonUS region . Cutoff value positive/negative stain accordance current ASCO/CAP ( American Society Clinical Oncology/College American Pathologists ) guideline . Central confirmation require ER , PR , HER status . Patients equivocal HER2 situ hybridization result accord current ASCO/CAP guideline allow , long clinician determine treated HER2 negative . For window phase : Patients must histologically confirm invasive lobular carcinoma invasive ductal carcinoma . No central confirmation histological subtype necessary enrollment . For treatment phase : Patients histological subtype eligible . Women 18 year age . Men eligible . ECOG performance status 0 1 Required laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL Total serum bilirubin ≤ ULN ; total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 × ULN direct bilirubin within normal range patient document Gilbert 's Syndrome Aspartate amino transferase ( AST SGOT ) alanine amino transferase ( ALT SGPT ) ≤ 2.0 × institutional ULN Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient serum creatinine level institutional ULN Postmenopausal patient define spontaneous menses ≥1 year ( 12 month ) post bilateral surgical oophorectomy . Premenopausal patient eligible participate provide consider chemical menopause . Premenopausal patient receive ongoing treatment LHRH agonist ( goserolin leuprolide ) . Premenopausal patient must enrol directly treatment phase study . Patient must agree require research biopsy baseline twoweek treatment endocrine therapy initial part study ( `` window phase '' ) ; baseline twoweek treat endocrine therapy plus minus palbociclib patient enrol directly treatment phase study . Patients must able willing swallow retain oral medication without condition would interfere enteric absorption . Breast image include image ipsilateral axilla . For subject clinically negative axilla , sentinel lymph node biopsy perform either preoperative therapy discretion subject 's physician . For subject clinically positive axilla , needle aspiration , core biopsy SLN procedure perform determine presence metastatic disease lymph node . Patients multifocal multicentric disease eligible treat clinician determine patient treat ER+ HER2 negative . Bilateral breast cancer allow treat clinician determine patient treat ER+ HER2 negative . Serum urine pregnancy test must negative woman judge premenopausal within 7 day randomization , woman amenorrhea less 12 month time randomization . Pregnancy test need pursue patient judge postmenopausal randomization , determine local practice , undergone bilateral oophorectomy , total hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation . Premenopausal patient must agree use adequate contraception duration protocol treatment 6 month last treatment palbociclib . Adequate contraception define one highly effective form ( i.e . abstinence , male female sterilization ) OR two effective form ( e.g . nonhormonal IUD condom/occlusive cap spermicidal foam / gel / film / cream/ suppository ) . Hormonal contraceptive method allow . Patients history ipsilateral contralateral DCIS eligible . Patients may concurrently receive bisphosphonates rank ligand inhibitor study necessary treatment prevention osteopenia osteoporosis . Prior treatment LHRH agonists allow premenopausal woman . Topical vaginal estrogen therapy allowable . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Concurrent therapy Investigational Products . Prior therapy CDK inhibitor . Patients Stage IV breast cancer eligible . Baseline stag document absence metastatic disease require , however recommend determined institutional practice ( patient may reasonable suspicion advanced disease e.g. , large tumor , clinically positive axillary lymph node , sign symptom ) . If perform , report examination must available . Examination type staging , i.e . Xray , sonography , bone scan , CT , MRI , and/or PETCT , discretion investigator . History allergic reaction attribute compound chemical biologic composition similar palbociclib . Patients receive medication substance potent inhibitor inducer CYP3A isoenzymes within 7 day randomization Uncontrolled illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , diabetes , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Ability comply study requirement assess investigator time screen study participation . Pregnant woman , woman childbearing potential without negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) within 7 day prior randomization , irrespective method contraception use , exclude study effect palbociclib develop fetus unknown . Breastfeeding must discontinue prior study entry . Patients history malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : Patients malignancy history invasive breast cancer eligible active malignancy deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Patients follow cancer eligible : ductal carcinoma situ breast , cervical cancer situ , nonmetastatic nonmelanomatous skin cancer . Patients combination antiretroviral therapy , i.e . HIVpositive , ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction increase immunosuppression palbociclib . HIV test require , patient must know HIVpositive . Patients receive concurrent exogenous hormone therapy ( hormone replacement therapy , oral hormonal contraceptive hormonal contraceptive coil eligible . Patients eligible previously receive endocrine therapy within 5 year prior diagnosis current malignancy . This include use prophylactic reason , include treatment osteoporosis cancer prevention tamoxifen , raloxifene , AI .</criteria>
