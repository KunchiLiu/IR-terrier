	<brief_summary>Scientific evidence dietary treatment type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) insufficient . The study group hypothesize low carbohydrate content diabetic diet recommend 55 energy percentage ( E % ) decrease postprandial glucose excursion . This reduce postprandial insulin concentration , together low glucose concentration lead less fat accumulation liver muscle tissue , result improved insulin sensitivity together reduce glucose load improve glucose metabolism . This clinical study examine subject type 2 diabetes effect highly control dietary low carbohydrate intervention metabolic pathway respect insulin action , pancreatic islet function , lipid metabolism , ectopic fat accumulation , incretin hormone , low grade inflammation plasma adipose tissue , novel measure fatty acid metabolism , heart rate variability , respectively . The study exhibit potential reform dietary recommendation aim prevent ameliorate type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cut Down Carbohydrate Usage Diet Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform randomized 12 week control , cross-over trial , address effect T2D isoenergetic low carbohydrate diet ( carbohydrate 30 E % , protein 30 E % , fat 40 E % ) compare isoenergetic control diet ( carbohydrate 50 E % , protein 17 E % , fat 33 E % ) currently recommend individual T2D . The study extend 24 week isoenergetic low carbohydrate diet examine prolong effect experimental diet T2D pathophysiology . To test hypothesis isoenergetic control diet detrimental glucose metabolism short transition diet , participant reinforce eat diet 6 week 24 week low carbohydrate/high protein diet . The study include n=30 subject T2D . All study participant provide meal low carbohydrate diet control diet free first part study , i.e . week 0 12 , food item prepare distribute research kitchen Department Nutrition , Exercise Sports , Faculty Science , University Copenhagen , Denmark optimize compliance adherence prescriped diet . During isoenergetic diet study weight stability reinforce facilitate interpretation diet effect . All diet isoenergetic accordance participant 's estimate daily total energy expenditure ( TEE ) . A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan undertaken determine body composition participant order estimate daily rest energy expenditure ( REE ) . To estimate TEE , physical activity level express PAL = TEE / REE , estimate . If participant develops weight loss weight gain three consecutive measurement and/or lose gain &gt; 1kg weight compare baseline , amount energy diet wil adjust accordingly enforce weight stability throughout full duration study . Measurements include glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) fast glucose , insulin , C-peptide non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA ) every 2 week first 12 week study every 4 week week 12 . At baseline , week 6 , 12 , 36 42 , respectively large measurement program undertake include insulin modify frequently sample intravenous glucose test ( IM-FSIGT ) meal test use Minimal Modelling , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRi ) fat content liver , abdomen muscle , adipose tissue biopsy , continous glucose monitor 48-hours include diurnal blood pressure Holter recording . A standard meal provide dinner day prior measurement program week 0 , 36 42 . At week 6 12 participant intake assigned meal . Participants inform refrain strenuous physical activity alcohol intake two day prior measurement program day .</detailed_description>
