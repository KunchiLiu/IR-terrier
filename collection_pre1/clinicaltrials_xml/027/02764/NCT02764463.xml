	<brief_summary>This prospective clinical study evaluate performance indirect , posterior occlusal-retained , fiber-reinforced-composite restoration . Methods : Between June 1999 June 2000 , total 58 patient age 33 62 year old ( 33 male , 25 female ) receive 65 FCRFPD prosthesis . All restoration make indirectly plaster model use unidirectional E-glass fiber ( Vectris- Ivoclar Vivadent , liechtenstein ) combination laboratory resin composite ( Signum , Heraeus-Kulzer ) cement accord instruction resin cement Variolink II ( Ivoclar Vivadent ) . After baseline recording , patient follow 6 month thereafter annually 15 year . The evaluation protocol involve technical ( chip , debonding fracture tooth/restoration ) biological failure ( caries ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As January 1999 , FRC FDPs offer alternative conventional therapy option Department study conduct . Between June-1999 June-2000 , 58 patient age 33 62 year old ( 25 female , 33 male , mean age : 47 ) receive 65 indirect posterior FRC FDPs . Before enrolment trial , patient provide write informed consent Information give patient regard alternative treatment option . The inclusion criterion follow : subject require least 18 year old , able read sign inform consent document , physically psychologically able tolerate conventional restorative procedure , active periodontal pulpal disease , primary caries , allergic resin-based material , pregnant nursing , antagonist teeth oppose FRC FDP restore , willing return follow-up examination outline investigator . The patient absent teeth tooth replace rest dentition diastema exclude . All restoration perform single operator , select consider clinical experience ( &gt; 10 year since graduation ) . All FDPs replace one miss tooth bond two adjacent abutment teeth use retention . No cantilever FDPs involve . Treatment perform two session : 1 ) Teeth preparation Impression take model analysis , 2 ) Try-in , cementation polish FDP . In first session , accurate evaluation space residual dental tissue acceptance type treatment patient , pillar teeth prepare use diamond bur high speed handpiece mesio-occlusal , disto-occlusal , MOD , onlay overlay preparation accord clinical situation . Cavity preparation require remove carious tissue , create minimal space necessary glass fiber support occlusal load . According `` Munack '' cavity 2x2mm occlusal surface 2mm depth able support 600N masticatory stress breaking , increase depth 4mm reach 700N . All cavity design realize follow criterion : minimum preparation depth 2.5mm minimum cavity width 2mm divergent proximal box bucco-lingual width proximal box least 3.5m round internal angle . Cavity preparation do rubber dam diamond bur ( 100micron ) high-speed handpiece , case carious tissue remove finely . After finish , cavity clean air-water spray gently air-dried order apply 37 % phosphoric acid etchant gel enamel dentin . The cavity rinse 30 air-water spray dry use suction keep moisture dentin layer bond apply onto surface light-cured . Composite material apply cavity order create block-out , eliminate undercuts increase thickness residual wall . Preparations finish polished fine grain bur ( 60 40 micron respectively ) . After remove rubber dam , complete arch impression take polyether material follow disinfecting impression 10 min . Provisional restoration place eugenol-free temporary cement . Dental impression photograph sent dental technician FRCFPD fabrication . FRC FDPs make one dental laboratory full arch plaster cast . The model first isolate two coat isolation medium . One unidirectional pre-impregnated E-glass fiber ( Vectris- Ivoclar Vivadent , Lienchestein ) use reinforce veneer composite . Each bundle consist 4000 glass fiber , diameter 1.7 mm , embed PMMA/bis-GMA matrix . Before fiber place cast , layer composite apply interproximal-occlusal box abutment teeth . The fiber bundle place bed flowable resin use metal hand instrument . After photo-polymerization halogen polymerization unit ( light output : 1200 mw/cm2 ) , framework veneer resin composite An opaque resin use case improve optical property . The veneer resin composite build incrementally ; construction polymerize final time heat-light polymerization oven . In second session , rubber dam placement removal provisional restoration , teeth clean prophylaxis brush pumice . After try-in FRCFPD check proximal contact marginal fit , adhesive surface restoration sandblast , clean ethanol air-dried . The cementation surface FDP treat resin monomer correspond resin cement use micro brush ( Heliobond Ivoclar Vivadent , liechtenstein ) . The resin leave unpolymerized , shield light , least 5 minute allow resin penetrate activate IPN-phase polymethacrylate polymer matrix FRC framework . The tooth surface prepared adhesion apply three step etch rinse adhesive . After removal excess resin , restoration cement use resin cement Variolink II . light-cured 40 surface ( lingual , labial , mesial , distal ) ( Astralis 10 , SN 018766 , Ivoclar Vivadent , light output : 1200 mW/cm2 ) . Static dynamic occlusion adjust use fine grit diamond bur . The power output unit measure radiometer ( placement restoration . After polymerization , restoration margin finish . Occlusion adjust fine diamond bur ( 60- 40-Âµm grit ) finally , restoration polish pointed silicon polisher abrasive polish brush . Patients receive individual instruction maintain plaque control . One operator apply restoration experience adhesive dentistry ( &gt; 10 year since graduation ) .</detailed_description>
