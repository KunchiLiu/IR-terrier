	<detailed_description>This randomise , crossover , double-blind , double-dummy , active-controlled , multicentre , phase II proof-of-concept study PD patient end-of-dose wearing-off ( motor fluctuation ) . In 2-period crossover design subject receive ODM-104/levodopa/ carbidopa Stalevo different study period randomise order . There screen period , 2 treatment period post-treatment period , altogether 7 scheduled visit : screen visit , baseline visit , 4 visit treatment period ( i.e . 2 visits/each period ) , end-of-study visit . Unscheduled visit may perform first 2 week treatment period , need adjust levodopa strength . The total study duration 10-15 week subject .</detailed_description>
