	<brief_title>AsthMatic Inflammation Neurocircuitry Activation ( MINA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma characterize airway inflammation , bronchial hyperresponsiveness airflow obstruction . The development symptom patient asthma initiated exposure variety airborne substance include aeroallergens . The inhalation allergens asthmatic subject initiate series complex , interactive immune event activation cell bound IgE , serve exist airway inflammation , intensify underlie airway hyperresponsiveness cause airflow obstruction . Although immune event process associated reaction largely localized airway , variety factor contribute ongoing allergic response either enhance inhibitory manner . The regulation modulation inflammatory action key determinant eventual severity asthma . The initial step activation allergic airway response ability inhale allergen activate IgE molecules pulmonary mast cell release store mediator generate synthesis new product , acutely contract airway smooth muscle . The mast cell also capable generate variety cytokine , , turn , cause persistence progression allergic response further underlying inflammation . In addition mast cell activation , inhale allergen capable stimulating resident lymphocytes lung . It propose allergen-responsive lymphocyte belong subpopulation T helper cell ( Th2 ) , capable generate variety cytokine , i.e . interleukin ( IL ) -4 , IL-5 , IL-13 . These Th2 cytokine activate local inflammatory response also serve initiate event outside lung , promote persistence allergic inflammatory response . To illustrate mean newly generate lung mediator affect allergic inflammation , investigator show inhaled allergen associate enhance bone marrow generation eosinophils . This enhance bone marrow production eosinophil associate bone marrow cell generation IL-5 , cause terminal differentiation eosinophils release circulation . Presumably , recently generate eosinophil enter circulation recruit lung may development eosinophilic inflammation severity asthma . Other factor also influence development intensity allergic inflammatory response inhale allergen . In preliminary study , investigator find stress associate final examination period college student enhance eosinophilic inflammatory response inhale allergen . In addition , investigator find final examination period , independent allergen challenge , circulate eosinophils increase . Moreover , Marin colleague ( 2009 ) study child asthma two-year period find mononuclear cell child report persistent life stress couple acute stressful event produce elevated level asthma-promoting cytokine compare asthmatic child without chronic stress healthy control . These finding suggest persistent stress associate acute stressor may promote allergic inflammatory event process include regulation eosinophil number recruitment lung . From study , investigator evidence suggest stress-related event influence allergic inflammation , presumably , peripheral response regulated central nervous system ( CNS ) event . Although stress-related event modulate inflammatory process , mechanisms CNS-site activity poorly understood . It propose area brain activate stress area activation may represent site CNS integrate information concern internal state body signal generation modulate factor enhancement inhibition allergic airway inflammation . To visualize potential site CNS activation asthma , possible use neuroimaging technique , positron emission tomography ( PET ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . The investigator complete two prior study use fMRI evaluate central mechanism associate allergic inflammation , study , anterior insula identify region activate asthma-related emotional cue predict subsequent development airway inflammation ( e.g . Rosenkranz , M et al ( 2005 ) Proceedings National Academy Science 102 , 13319-13324. ) . In addition , investigator complete study use PET evaluate neural mechanism stress along contributes asthma-related inflammation individual high low level chronic stress . This study corroborate finding use fMRI , show involvement insula , also reveal new mechanism involve IL-1β/IL-17 potential pathway link stress-reactivity prime airway inflammation . In research describe , two experimental paradigm merge 1 ) determine contribution IL-1β/IL-17 pathway response emotion neural circuitry provoke airway inflammation absence bronchoconstriction 2 ) determine neural mechanism impact acute stress airway inflammatory response whole lung allergen challenge .</detailed_description>
