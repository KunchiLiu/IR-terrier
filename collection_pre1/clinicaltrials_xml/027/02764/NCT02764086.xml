	<brief_summary>This prospective non-randomised Phase I/II study patient recruit escalated dose cohort . Escalated dose iGTV ( internal gross tumour volume ) , 60 Gy conventional PTV ( plan target volume ) , deliver successive cohort participant ( 6-12 participants/cohort ) maximum tolerated oesophageal dose determine . The minimum dose 60 Gy deliver via intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) volume modulate arc therapy ( VMAT ) , plan Average Intensity Projection ( AVIP ) dataset . Standard care chemotherapy . In initial part study patient receive either neo-adjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapy . Following initial toxicity evaluation , study extend include concurrent chemotherapy arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective non-randomised Phase I/II cohort study ; please see Radiation Therapy Chemotherapy treatment detail Each cohort require minimum 6 maximum 12 patient . Once 6 patient treated cohort two-month break take toxicity analyse . - If 2 few patient experience grade ≥3 toxicity , next cohort enrol receive escalate dose ( +5 Gy escalation maximum 75 Gy ) - If 3 6 patient experience grade ≥3 toxicity , 6 patient recruit dose level - If 4 patient experience grade ≥3 toxicity MTD fix dose level previous cohort If cohort extend 12 patient , follow rule apply : - If 4 few patient experience grade ≥3 toxicity , next cohort enrol receive escalate dose . - If 5 12 patient experience grade ≥3 toxicity , MTD fix dose level recruitment continue total 24 patient dose level . - If 6 patient experience grade ≥3 toxicity , MTD fix dose level previous cohort . Once maximum dose cohort establish , patient continue recruit dose level total 24 patient . Once maximum dose cohort establish patient continue recruit dose level total 24 patient . The first concurrent chemotherapy cohort open 6 month first neo-adjuvant /no chemotherapy cohort complete radiation therapy . The concurrent neo-adjuvant /no chemotherapy arm escalate independently . For chemotherapy arm follow number patient require : - Minimum number ( maximum dose level reach ) = 36 ( 6 65 Gy , 6 70 Gy 24 75 Gy ) - Maximum number ( maximum dose level reach ) = 48 ( 12 65 Gy , 12 70 Gy 24 75 Gy ) A maximum 48 patient require complete chemotherapy arm ( neo-adjuvant none /concurrent ) trial . Acute toxicity assess weekly treatment 2 , 4 8 week post-treatment Late toxicity assess 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month post-treatment annually thereafter disease relapse / patient withdrawal / patient death .</detailed_description>
