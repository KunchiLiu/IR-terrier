	<detailed_description>This research study do determine Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention ( OT-DI ) improve safe driving performance ( less error ) short term ( immediately follow intervention ) intermediate term ( 3 month ) . Baseline testingâ€”Pre-test 1 -- include clinical battery test simulate drive test , Brief Driving Questionnaire , Community Integration Questionnaire , Satisfaction Life Questionnaire . Caregivers/ family member rate participant ' drive behavior use Fitness-to-Drive Screening Measure ( FTDS ) . After baseline test 60 participant ( 60 associate caregiver ) randomly assign balance intervention group ( 15 participant Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) / Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) 15 participant orthopedic condition caregiver ) control group ( 15 TBI/PTSD 15 orthopedic condition caregiver ) . The intervention group receive Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention ( OT-DI ) , consist three x 1 hour session include : Session 1 : Driving evaluator review explicit drive error participant ; Session 2 : Driving evaluator provide tailor strategy mitigate error ; Session 3 : Participants drive simulator target feedback drive evaluator . The control group receive , drive safety professional , three x 1 hour general safety session ( Session 1 : General traffic safety discussion ; Session 2 : Rules road knowledge road discussion ; Session 3 : drive simulator without feedback traffic safety professional ) . Immediately session 3 , Post-test 1 occur use standardize protocol outline baseline test . Post-test 2 consist test standardize protocol administer baseline testing . Caregivers/ family member rate participant driving behavior use FTDS . In addition , investigator obtain drive data Department Motor Vehicles include : citation , violation , drive mishap , crash occur participant .</detailed_description>
