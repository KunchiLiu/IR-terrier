	<detailed_description>Mental health problem disproportionately affect racial ethnic minority population , well population face chronic economic hardship . There clear evidence ( 1 ) process lay groundwork mental health disparity lay childhood ( 2 ) damage dysregulation physiologic stress response powerful mechanism effect chronic stress associate poverty psychopathology . To contribute solution mental health disparity , intervention need capable affect system confer risk . Since psychobiologic stress response system ( e.g. , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ; HPA ) central mechanism link health disparity chronic stress , stress response critical system target . Improving child 's ability cope stress regulate reactivity potential break cycle damage , especially cop strategy regulatory process target effect physiologic level . New evidence emerge show different type cop evident level HPAâ€”it , therefore , time evaluate whether cop intervention design child face chronic stress ( ) improve child 's ability use primary secondary control coping , ( b ) sustain effect physiologic level . The BaSICS intervention design address core underlying mechanism risk repair highly stressful context poor , urban youth ' life . Preadolescence crucial time child 's ability recognize stress cause matures , repertoires cop stress grow size complexity . In addition , preadolescence time increase brain change growth key self-regulatory organ system . Preadolescents , therefore , ripe stage benefit coping-based prevention plasticity developmental period suggest change potential long-lasting . BaSICS design prevent onset anxiety , depression , post-traumatic stress symptom preadolescent child face chronic stress . Two mechanisms action target project . First , project seek demonstrate child face chronic stress stem poverty , discrimination , violence exposure acquire utilize new way cop adaptive wide variety circumstance . Second , project examine extent improve cop result intervention engage physiologic intermediate mechanism HPA . Finally , project aim link change cop HPA change internalize symptom would signal prevention emergence new worsen exist symptom . Discovery way prevent and/or halt progression damage child 's stress response system lead psychopathology offer new direction combat health disparity .</detailed_description>
