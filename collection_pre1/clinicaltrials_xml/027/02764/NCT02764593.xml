Group 2 : Oral cavity , larynx , hypopharynx , p16negative oropharynx cancer , stage T12N2aN3 T34N03 base follow diagnostic workup : Mandatory submission H &amp; E p16 stain slides central review p16 stain required oropharyngeal patient H &amp; E stain slide block ( punch biopsy paraffin block ) PDL1 expression analysis patient History/physical examination within 28 day prior registration Examination Radiation Oncologist , Medical Oncologist , Ear , Nose , Throat ( ENT ) Head &amp; Neck Surgeon within 28 day prior registration Fiberoptic exam laryngopharyngoscopy within 28 day prior registration Diagnostic quality CT MRI neck , contrast , within 28 day prior registration ; 18FFDGPET/CT neck acceptable substitute CT diagnostic quality IV contrast . Age ≥ 18 year The trial open gender Definitive clinical radiologic evidence distant ( beyond cervical lymph node neck tissue ) metastatic disease . Patients oral cavity cancer exclude participation resection primary tumor consider technically feasible oral head neck cancer surgical subspecialist . Carcinoma neck unknown primary site origin ( even p16positive ) . Absence RECIST , v. 1.1 define measurable disease . Gross total excision primary nodal disease ; include tonsillectomy , local excision primary site , nodal excision remove clinically radiographically evident disease . Patients RECIST , v. 1.1 evaluable remain cancer either neck primary site remain eligible . Simultaneous primary cancer separate bilateral primary tumor site . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3 year ; ( example , carcinoma situ breast , oral cavity , cervix permissible ) . Prior systemic chemotherapy study cancer . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field . Patients active autoimmune disease , exception vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism psoriasis . Use systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration , exception inhale topical steroid .
