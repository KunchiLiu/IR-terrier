	<brief_summary>The main purpose study identify best dose V81444 use future trial patient Parkinson 's disease . The study also explore effect V81444 brain activity blood flow test mental ability ( `` cognitive function test '' ) . It also check safe V81444 well tolerate dosing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Healthy Male Volunteers Investigate New Drug Treatment Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase I , single-centre , open-label , adaptive , single-dose study multiple dose level , relationship dose plasma concentration orally administer V81444 brain A2A RO investigate 6 healthy male volunteer . In addition , effect V81444 regional brain activity perfusion test cognitive function , safety tolerability V81444 assess . For subject , study consist screen visit , baseline visit , treatment period , safety follow-up visit . The dose V81444 timing scan perform define protocol first 2 subject . The dose , nature timing assessment subsequent subject determine base review emerge receptor binding , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) safety information . In treatment period , subject admit unit day dose ( Day -1 ) , receive single oral dose V81444 Day 1 , subject satisfactory medical review , discharge minimum 12 h dosing . Overall , 3 dos V81444 assess ( 250 mg , 50 mg , 100 mg ) , 2 subject include dose level . PD assessment perform baseline dose V81444 use PET ( A2A radioligand , measure brain A2A RO , well MRI technique investigate effect V81444 regional brain activity perfusion cognitive function test . PK parameter assess assay V81444 concentration plasma . Safety tolerability assess monitor physical examination finding , adverse event ( AEs ) , vital sign , 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) clinical laboratory safety test .</detailed_description>
