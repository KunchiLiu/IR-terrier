	<detailed_description>1 . ICT intervention . A personalized SMS base patient communication feedback system ( Microsoft ) . Utilizing jointly decide upon follow-up parameter individual receive periodic SMS reminder . In case consistent non-adherence system alert diabetes nurse educator contact individual ( addition routine monthly call ) order understand difficulty devise alternate plan . The personalized SMS system base insight recent successful clinical trial conduct people diabetes . The system base machine learn module learns use attribute participant ( age , gender etc . ) activity well past experience predict SMS message would incentivize person enhance conduction decide upon treatment plan ( example certain type physical activity ) . In way system achieve improvement superior achieve generic feedback system . Mobile health technology ( mHealth ) . MHealth use mobile phone technology deliver health care . This innovation develop address array issue monitor chronic condition , medication adherence , improve patient provider communication , disease emergency track .

The intervention include two phase : 1 . Intensive phase : 12 weekly group meet 4 hour . Each meeting compose : - 2 hour guide neuropsychologist dedicate different cognitive domain example memory , concentration , planning , information processing , problem solving ( special emphasis diabetes issue ) . Each session compose : 1 ) introduction- homework previous session check cognitive domain discuss day introduce ; 2 ) cognitive training use computerized system ( hour ) ; 3 ) group discussion compensatory strategy train conduct home - 2 hour guide certified physical trainer . These include strength , balance aerobic element conduct group individualize accord capability target individual assessed evaluation day . These session also include formulation plan exercise conduct individual daily basis . Additionally , 30 minute session dedicate psycho-education various disease management aspect guide diabetes nurse educator dietitian ( alternate ) . 2 . Consolidation phase : 9 month monthly group meeting . The consolidation group session include monthly 2 hour group discussion challenge implementation cop strategy Medical surveillance take place every 2 month monitor glucose , blood pressure lipid control well follow-up recommendation give feed-back session conduct Diabetes nurse educator work together diabetes specialist Endocrinologist ( study physician ) maximal risk factor reduction .</detailed_description>
