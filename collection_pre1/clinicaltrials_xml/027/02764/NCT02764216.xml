	<brief_summary>The optimal treatment HNCUP remain controversial lack evidence prospective randomize trial . The management patient rely primarily surgery radiotherapy . The role radiotherapy sterilize putative mucosal sit remain controversial . The main debate concern extent radiation field . Although pan-mucosal irradiation nasopharynx hypopharynx bilateral neck node reduces risk emergence mucosal primary nodal relapse , associate significant toxicity long-term morbidity ( mostly xerostomia dysphagia ) . Most single institution retrospective study show advantage extensive irradiation.Therefore , elective mucosal irradiation may might appropriate patient .</brief_summary>
