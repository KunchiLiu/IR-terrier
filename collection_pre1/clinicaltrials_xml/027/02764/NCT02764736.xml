	<brief_summary>The specific aim trial determine whether initiate moderate- high-intensity atorvastatin therapy hemodialysis patient previously statin reduces inflammation lower average Epogen utilization . Statin naive patient maintenance HD start 20mg atorvastatin daily week titrate 40mg atorvastatin daily additional 12 week . Patient 's inflammatory marker ( ferritin , CRP ) weekly Epogen usage monitor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients identify consent . After informed consent obtain , baseline demographic information , past medical history , dialysis specific information , laboratory metric ( lipid profile , inflammatory marker ) obtain electronic medical record . For first 12 week , subject instruct take one 20mg atorvastatin tablet daily ; atorvastatin tablet dispense research team 30-tablet increment every month ensure compliance prevent diversion . Subjects undergo standard-of-care hemodialysis routine hemoglobin monitoring Epogen titration accord dialysis center protocol . Every two week , assess research coordinator monitor medication adverse effect ( see attach patient survey ) medication compliance ( pill count ) alternate visit . After 12 week , lipid profile inflammatory marker rechecked obtain electronic medical record . For subsequent 12 week ( ie . week 12-24 ) , subject instructed take two 20mg atorvastatin tablet ( 40mg total ) daily . If subject unable tolerate 40mg atorvastatin daily due medication adverse effect , continue take 20mg atorvastatin daily remainder trial . Epogen titrate subject monitor . At completion study , lipid panel inflammatory marker check third time . Epogen usage dialysis specific information record continuously throughout study .</detailed_description>
