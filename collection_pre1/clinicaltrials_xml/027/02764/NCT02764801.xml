	<brief_title>Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Evaluation Chemoembolization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized trial conduct three clinical site . The subject population patient undergo transarterial chemoembolization treatment hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) Thomas Jefferson University , The University California , San Diego , Vanderbilt University . Patients receive contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) exam morning prior embolization , approximately one week post-embolization , one month MRI follow ( schedule part clinical standard care ) . This trial consist 210 adult ( 70 per institution ) undergo transarterial chemoembolization treatment HCC split evenly Thomas Jefferson University , The University California , San Diego , Vanderbilt University . Patients identify consecutively approached institution 's Hepatology / Transplant Surgery Interventional Radiology practice ( site 's Hepatology Interventional Radiology co-investigators ) . An investigator research coordinator explain study patient . The patient give time consider risk benefit study ask question participation . A consent form review patient . A full history physical examination obtain patient 's refer physician . If subject woman childbearing potential , urine pregnancy test prior CEUS study ( result make available subject prior study initiation ) . In event patient present lesion expect difficult view ultrasound ( example , small lesion locate high liver dome ) , grayscale ultrasound image quickly perform ensure lesion visible ultrasound patient suitable study inclusion . Patients undergo total three separate CEUS exam . These exam consist baseline study morning prior TACE therapy , study 1-2 week post treatment coincide clinical post-procedure follow-up interventional radiologist , study approximately one month post treatment patient return clinically schedule CE-CT/MRI follow-up . If patient fail show 1-2 week CEUS exam , exclude final ultrasound exam . Procedures equipment trial use accordance standard clinical protocol good clinical practice already place hospital . The first three case institution ( baseline least one follow-up ) perform guidance least one study PIs ensure standardization amongst three site . The ultrasound examination perform qualified sonographer . Efforts make CEUS scan perform dedicated sonographer , enable u evaluate operator dependence . During ultrasound examination , patient ask lie supine position 20-22 gauge cannula place superficial vein ( preferably antecubital vein ) . Ultrasound image perform use state art Logiq E9 scanner C1-5-D broad-spectrum convex transducer RAB2-5-D broad-spectrum real-time 4D transducer ( GE Healthcare , Wauwatosa , WI ) . As part study , investigator budget purchase 3 4D probe ( routinely available clinical practice ) installation GE 's ultrasound volumetric contrast imaging package provide 2D 4D CEUS capability . In event patient multiple lesion schedule treatment , 2 lesion image independently CEUS . Patients first undergo 2D baseline imaging . B-mode measurement sweep lesion transverse sagittal plane perform , follow standard power Doppler imaging ( PDI ) . Following baseline imaging , patient receive bolus IV injection 0.6 ml Definity , follow 10 cc saline flush . Since Definity currently approve echocardiography , investigator apply FDA investigational new drug application CEUS evaluation TACE . All CEUS imaging perform use dual B-mode ( use locate anatomical feature ) nonlinear contrast ( identify ultrasound contrast agent ) image mode . A low mechanical index ( &lt; 0.1 ) use minimize microbubble destruction imaging . The standard nonlinear imaging frequency pairing contrast imaging software use ( transmit 2 MHz , receive 4 MHz harmonic ) , gain setting adjust minimize nonlinear signal prior contrast injection . Additionally , focal zone place approximate depth lesion maximize generation nonlinear signal CEUS . During first contrast injection , 2D CEUS perform use cod harmonic nonlinear imaging package unit . The approximate tumor mid-line image homogenous liver enhancement achieve ( approximately 45 second post injection ) , follow imaging sweep tumor . Sweeps acquire sagittal plane , return original plane . Imaging continue contrast washout observe ( approximately 3-4 minute ) , data digitally store later review . A fifteen minute wait period observe injection allow complete ultrasound contrast agent clearance . A region interest encompass entire tumor volume margin select 4D mode . Baseline image tumor repeat 4D mode grayscale B-mode . A second bolus injection 0.6 ml Definity follow 10 cc saline flush administer continuous tumor image 4D , use machine 's coded harmonic package . Data obtain contrast washout observe digitally store digital imaging communication medicine ( DICOM ) format later review .</detailed_description>
