	<brief_summary>The human endometrium extremely sensitive target . LLLT enhance proliferation rate various cell line , produce high rate ATP , RNA , DNA synthesis stem cell cell line . Thus , LLLT improve proliferation cell without cause cytotoxic effect . The aim work assess ability low level laser therapy enhance endometrial proliferation increase endometrial receptivity . A number 120 human endometrial sample study , collect 40 infertile woman attend infertility clinic NRC . Each human endometrial sample divide 3 plate , order establish 3 main group 40 culture plate single laser exposure group versus 40 culture plat multiple laser exposure group 40 tissue culture plat control sample , thus total 120 tissue culture plat study , study group expose low level laser therapy compare match controls.. Assessment number size cell LLLT marker normal proliferation b ) The expression Integrin aVB3 `` alpha v B3 '' , MUC-1 LIFand development pinopodes surface epithelial cell marker endometrial receptivity detection PTEN tumor suppressor gene marker abnormal proliferation premalignant condition perform assess effect LLLT endometrial cell culture . This study might offer new therapeutic modality might increase endometrial thickness enhance receptivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Low Level Laser Therapy Endometrial Cells : An In Vitro Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plan work : A number 40 human endometrial sample collect 40 infertile woman attend infertility clinic National Research Center ( sample divide 3 culture plate ; single exposure group , multiple exposure group control group ) include study . Each human endometrial sample divide 3 plate , order establish 3 main group 40 culture plate single laser exposure group versus 40 culture plat multiple laser exposure group 40 tissue culture plat control sample , thus total 120 tissue culture plat study , study group expose low level laser therapy compare matched control . Timing endometrial tissue sample : Endometrial tissue biopsy perform early proliferative phase menstruation cease ( day 5 day8 ) . Consent A write informed consent obtain woman procedure . The consent explain purpose procedure , aim research possible side effect . Endometrial cell culture : Endometrial biopsy strip collect woman include study . The endometrial biopsy strip take uterine wall use pipelle . Endometrial tissue transport laboratory isolation medium . Endometrial tissue store 4Â°C , process within 2-10 h. Clusters cell consider colony become visible macroscopically contain great 50 cell . The culture condition apply study control sample . The tissue culture discard 14 day study complete . Low level laser therapy wavelength 635nm diode laser , power 40mw test cultured endometrial cell Petri dish S.A. 9.62cm2 fluence rate 4 J/cm2 continuous mode , depth penetration 635nm range 1 6mm . Tissue culture study group divide 2 group ; The 1st group compose 40 tissue culture plat expose total fluence dose 8.5 J/cm2 single session 16 minute duration low level therapy machine adjust power 80mw . The 2nd group compose another 40 tissue culture plat , expose fluence rate multiple session `` 3 session '' , perform every day , session last approximately 5.34 minute use low level laser power 80mw reach fluence dose 8.5 J/cm2 finish 3rd session . Single versus multiple exposure LLLT test endometrial culture plate compare control group expose laser . Comparison single session exposure multiple session ' exposure important order determine benefit risk multiple exposure session thin endometrium vivo , invasive procedure require fibro-optic probe insertion inside uterus might cause discomfort patient could affect patient 's compliance . RT-PCR Analysis technique step : Real time PCR use screen detect presence endometrial implantation marker namely expression Integrin aVB3 `` alpha v B3 '' , MUC-1 , LIF also expression PTEN tumor suppressor gene early marker premalignant endometrial disease . Electron microscopy ; Cells tissue culture examine electron microscope order detect presence pinopodes marker increase endometrial receptivity .</detailed_description>

Women unexplained infertility exclusion cause infertility exclusion male factor . Women endometrial cancer precancerous lesion . Women malignancy genital tract vulval , vaginal , cervical , ovarian malignancy . Women undergo dilatation curettage due follow condition exclude : Any pregnancy relate pathology ( eg , incomplete abortion , miss abortion , septic abortion , induced pregnancy termination , treatment evaluation gestational trophoblastic disease ) . Dilatation curettage dysfunctional uterine bleeding ; irregular bleeding menorrhagia Hormonal treatment medication may affect endometrium , include patient receive hormonal therapy 3 month precede study . Before endometrial ablation treatment endometrial hyperplasia perimenopausal bleed . Tissues prove precancerous neoplastic change endometrial sample discard eliminate initiation study .</criteria>
