	<detailed_description>Uveitis represent heterogeneous group diseases result ocular inflammatory reaction involve ocular tissue vasculature . The inflammation usually cause pain , redness , photophobia blur vision . H.P Acthar Gel stimulate adrenal cortex secrete cortisol . Additionally H.P . Acthar gel also report bind melanocortin receptor . Melanocortin receptor activation show exert mark anti-inflammatory immune-modulatory effect animal study , modulate pro inflammatory cytokine , follow induction anti- inflammatory mediator subsequent leukocyte migration . Specifically melanocortins regulate Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) alpha , Interleukin ( IL ) -2 , Interferon gamma T-cell proliferation upregulates IL-10 regulatory T cell . For reason H.P . Acthar approve treatment ocular inflammatory disease . Ocular inflammatory disease typically treat regional systemic therapy . The regional therapy typically consist topical corticosteroid periocular regional corticosteroid . Regional therapy lead steroid response glaucoma , increase intraocular pressure.This pilot study aim evaluate possible effectiveness H.P . Acthar patient active ocular inflammatory disease , currently treatment glaucoma history glaucoma . Subjects treat H P Acthar subcutaneous gel , 40 U/ml , give twice weekly x 8 week , follow weekly x 4 week : total 20 dos cumulative unit administer , use approve route , option 4 additional dos resolution incomplete . This prospective open-label , non-randomized pilot study : 12 week treatment active non-infectious uveitis , endpoint assessment safety assessment ; additional 12 week assessment uveitis activity/quiescence safety assessment .</detailed_description>
