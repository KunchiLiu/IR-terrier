	<brief_title>Sleep Apnea Lung Cancer : A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome ( OSAHS ) important medical condition cause significant morbidity mortality . The prevalence OSAHS Spain 4-6 % men 2-4 % woman rise steadily age . Snoring smoke independently link , smoke may risk factor develop OSAHS . This particularly true heavy smoker ( &gt; 2 packs/day ) , great risk LC . Associations OSAHS form cancer describe human , especially experience nocturnal hypoxemia , intermittent hypoxia link progression cancer animal model . LC currently lead cause cancer death developped nation . A link OSAHS LC , therefore , plausible . Sleep disorder breathing may common among patient recently diagnose lung cancer may contribute tumor progression . Objectives : ) To perform home sleep test patient recently diagnose lung cancer order determine prevalence sleep disorder breathing patient population . b ) To include biological sample obtain participant , include surgically treat patient stage I / IIp LC program CIBERES Pulmonary Biobank Platform . Biological sample preserve different storage condition subsequent determination molecular biomarkers . c ) To follow-up lung cancer patient without sleep disorder breathe order determine potential influence OSAHS might prognosis . Prospective screen sleep disorder breathing perform home sleep test 100 subject diagnose lung cancer , irrespective stage diagnosis , give consent . A modified epidemiologic questionnaire sleep disorder breathing also administer . Patients identify suffer OSAHS refer sleep clinic . Biologic sample lung function study obtain participate patient . All patient lung cancer undergo follow-up least three year demise , identify OSAHS also follow sleep clinic . The prevalence OSAHS patient population determine . A link OSAHS , especially intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia , tumor progression seek .</detailed_description>
