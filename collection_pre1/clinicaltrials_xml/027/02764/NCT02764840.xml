	<brief_summary>Resistance exercise elastic tube use part rehabilitation maintenance muscle tone level different scenario , disease condition sport universe . There convenience low cost instrument , provide impact clinical economic framework case spillage use strategy . In recent search , investigator observe data reliability reproducibility specific test tool sense , seem pertinent undertake research topic . Objectives : To determine reliability reproducibility comparison isokinetic muscle strength test locate Ã¢ fatigue hold elastic tube compare result train protocol muscle strength gain method , elastic tube dynamometer . Methods : Participants perform muscular endurance test localize fatigue , two occasion , interval seven day . Everyone accomplish much elastic tube , isokinetic dynamometer . It hold evaluator analysis intra inter evaluator . After first stage study determine reliability test , participant undergo three week train gain muscular endurance , distribute two group G1 ( train elastic tube ) G2 ( train isokinetic dynamometer ) previously randomize . It use intra-class correlation coefficient 95 % confidence interval check repeatability Kappa coefficient 95 % confidence interval reproducibility . To compare response train , distribution make normality data Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . In case normal distribution , Student 's t-test unpaired data Mann-Whitney adopt normal distribution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscular Resistance Test Elastic Tube : Reliability Training Proposed Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study : assess reliability method fatigue resistance assessment elastic tube two area , inter intra-examiner ; check test reproducibility different time participant compare method gold standard evaluation , isokinetic dynamometer compare strength gain endurance application specific train elastic tube isokinetic dynamometer . It study reproducibility , follow application training protocol feature clinical trial . Data collection hold Center Studies Assistance Physical Therapy Rehabilitation ( CEAFIR ) FCT / UNESP , respect hour 17:00 22:00 . The study conduct two stage : Reliability reproducibility , Training . In first stage study , procedure conduct six session . In first , participant submit anthropometric measurement , questionnaire physical activity level ( IPAQ Baecke ) Contraction Maximum Voluntary ( CVM ) isokinetic dynamometer test familiarization first analysis tool ( elastic tube isokinetic dynamometer ) previously randomize . Randomization make lot Excel . It give interval two day familiar first test . In second session , participant perform test twice , standardize interval five minute . In test different supervisory therapist order check whether correlation therapist . In third session , seven day initial test , retests carry therapist oversaw previous session , aim find non-compliance information record therapist . In fitness test , seven-day period separation commonly use . For test play two occasion separate seven day . In order control possible bias , order application assessor test retest cross , first evaluate test , shall accord reviewer retest vice versa . Furthermore , test session , insert application first evaluator , five minute rest , application Likert scale recovery Perception second evaluator start test . If participant report less seven , understood yet recover case scale reapplied interval one minute report value exceeds seven . The choice value base priori knowledge acquire pilot respect biological individuality participant . Although age group sample health condition non-recovery situation exception , understand disposal information adequate far individual profile participant recovery . As central object case test , option ensure inclusion eligible study use information great control background level participant . Such information log discussion . Tests conduct tool precede warm ten repetition knee flexion-extension dominant limb without charge . Finalized procedure first tool , participant undergo cross , start fourth , fifth sixth session procedure identical first three session , differ tool . This stage study cross In second stage study , sample randomize allocated two group ( G1 G2 ) . The periodization group identical , differ instrument feature , outline procedure .</detailed_description>
