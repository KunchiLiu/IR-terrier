	<brief_summary>Introduction Several attempt make improve facilitate epidural space detection beside conventional loss resistant technique . Recently many sophisticated equipment 's technique describe receive widespread popularity . Objectives The Investigator describes assess validity use Pressure Gauge Manometer confirm correct detection lumber epidural space , inexpensive way . Methods Tuohy needle introduce intervertebral space level L3-L4 interspinous ligament ( nearly 2cm mark needle ) .A3-way stopcock connect hub Tuohy needle in-line port stopcock attach air-filled 10 ml syringe . Using 75 cm extension tube set create 30 mm Hg pressure gradient manometer tip epidural needle , needle advance slowly use hand monitor manometer reading stop pressure suddenly drop ( pressure usually drop 5-10 mm Hg tip needle inters epidural space ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>â€¢ A total 60 consecutive ASA class 1 &amp; II patient age 28-68 year schedule elective surgery lumber epidural anesthesia general anesthesia plan post-operative epidural analgesia enrol study . Patients know coagulation disorder , allergy local anesthetic , skin lesion puncture side , neuromuscular disease include . Patients place sit position American society anesthesiologist standard monitor attach . After skin preparation , drape , local anesthetic infiltration , epidural Tuohy needle introduce intervertebral space level L3-L4 interspinous ligament ( nearly 2cm mark needle ) . Fig 1 A3-way stopcock connect hub Tuohy needle in-line port stopcock attach air-filled 10 ml syringe . Using 75 cm extension tube set side port connect Pressure Gauge Manometer hold assistant . The stopcock turn needle direct continuity syringe pressure Gage manometer . The syringe use create 30 mm Hg pressure read manometer , stopcock turn `` open '' manometer Tuohy needle `` close '' syringe . With 30 mm Hg pressure gradient manometer tip epidural needle , needle advance slowly use hand monitor manometer reading stop pressure change ( pressure usually drop 5-10 mm Hg tip needle inters epidural space ) . The 3-way removed local anesthetic inject single shot epidural block catheter introduce conventional manner secure adhesive tap . Procedure perform anesthetist different level experience ( consultant , specialist , resident ) . Demographic data type surgery record along time technique , number pass require enter epidural space , false LOR , insertion difficulty , accidental dural puncture , complication occur .</detailed_description>
