	<brief_title>Evaluation Gallbladder Contractility Using Both CCK Milk Consecutively</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatobiliary imaging ( HIDA ) important role evaluation function dynamic hepatobiliary system flow bile gastrointestinal system . Contractility gallbladder one function uniquely evaluate use HIDA scan . Poor contractility gallbladder source pain many patient . Anatomic image study like ultrasound , CT and/or MRI usually normal patient . Contractility gallbladder evaluate HIDA scan intravenous injection cholecystokinin ( CCK ) physiologic peptide enzyme produce duodenum response presence fatty meal cause gallbladder contract sphincter Oddi relax , thus allow flow bile gallbladder duodenum . CCK usually administer HIDA scan intravenously fill gallbladder radioactive tracer simulate action endogenous CCK contract gallbladder relaxation sphincter Oddi . Gallbladder ejection fraction ( GBEF ) response CCK injection calculate use special computer software program . A normal gallbladder ejection fraction equal great 35 % . Alternative CCK injection , patient may administer milk fatty drink stimulate normal gallbladder contract reach duodenum approximately 15-20 minute oral administration . Thus , gallbladder contractility may evaluate HIDA scan either inject CCK intravenously oral administration milk . Poor contractility gallbladder may result abdominal pain usually trigger meal . However , many patient abdominal pain decrease gallbladder contractility evaluate IV CCK milk may continue suffer pain even surgical removal gallbladder . This suggest abnormally decrease GBEF CCK milk stimulation may represent false abnormal find result unnecessary cholecystectomy patient . There report literature use intravenous CCK stimulation oral milk administration together patient . This study aim combine use IV CCK administration follow oral milk HIDA scan stimulate gallbladder contractility decrease number false abnormal HIDA scan unnecessary cholecystectomy patient .</detailed_description>
