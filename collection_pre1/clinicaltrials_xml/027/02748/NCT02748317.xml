	<detailed_description>Lower urinary symptom common issue individual neurogenic bladder , commonly occur Spina bifida Spinal Cord Injury population . In study , probiotic introduce bladder prevent UTIs . Introduction probiotic determine validated symptom questionnaire ( USQ-NB ) protocol ( SMP-PRO ) . This study estimate strength association successful implementation probiotic self-management program ( USQ-NB SMP-PRO ) urinary symptom , bladder inflammation , urine microbiome . Investigators conduct 18-month study participant serve his/her control 3 phase study : 6-months usual care ( baseline ) , 6-months probiotic intervention , 6-months follow-up . Participants complete Urinary Symptom Questionnaire weekly . After 6 month baseline data collection , participant receive Lactobacillus ( Culturelle GG , 20 billion live organism adult 10 billion live organism child &lt; 18 year age ) , instructed preparation intravesicular instillation Lactobacillus , tutorial fellow consumer use patient-initiated protocol . The protocol Lactobacillus bladder instillation instruction ( include step-by-step video ) available study website 24/7 access write instruction provide time instruction . For intravesicular Lactobacillus instillation , participant instruct mix content sterile saline . After mix , participant draw liquid Lactobacillus mixture 60cc catheter tip syringe instill via intermittent catheter fully empty bladder . Participants instructed catheterize least 4 hour bladder instillation . Participants receive 10 Culturelle GG begin treatment phase . At end month , coordinator RA ask many remain tablet participant , need dispense next supply 10 tablet . Participants instruct complete USQ-NB weekly . If/when urinary symptom occur , subject instruct follow protocol determine whether initiate intravesicular Lactobacillus instillation evaluate physician . The self-management protocol also direct discontinue Lactobacillus instillation evaluate physician symptom remit , persist ( 2 instillation ) , worsen . The maximum number instillation 2 28 hour . If participant direct self-management protocol seek medical attention s/he feel need medical evaluation , s/he advise obtain care typically would health care provider . Participants supply letter bring health care provider notify study request share urinalysis urine culture result research team . A verified UTI include result antibiotic treatment health care professional . An additional urine sample metagenomics either leave health care provider pick research team , bring research site , obtain RA mutually convenient site . After completion 6-month patient-initiated , self-management protocol intervention period , participant monitor symptoms weekly use USQ-NB final 6-month phase 18-month study .</detailed_description>
