	<detailed_description>Background : fluctuation cerebral blood flow oxygenation neonates undergo intensive care important risk factor risk neurodevelopmental impairment . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) allow direct measurement cerebral tissue oxygenation . Automated FiO2 adjustment maintain arterial oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) within target range may reduce risk fluctuation cerebral oxygenation . Aim study : evaluate efficacy automate FiO2 adjustment maintain SpO2 within target range reduce risk cerebral tissue hypo-oxygenation due SpO2 fluctuation preterm infant invasive non invasive respiratory support supplemental oxygen . Methodology : multicenter randomize cross-over clinical trial . The study carry almost 1 year . Study center : 7 Italian Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) Number subject : 60 infant &gt; 90 % power , alpha p=0.01 , detect 5 % difference % -time target range 50 % difference SpO2 hyperoxic hypoxic % -time . Diagnosis main inclusion criterion : preterm infant 25+0-28+6 week gestational age , require invasive non invasive respiratory support supplemental oxygen . Other enrollment requirement : All infant enrol &gt; 72 hour ( end transition period ) &lt; /= 7 day . Expected remain current mode support 48-hour intervention period . Infants major congenital anomaly , haemodynamic instability ( patent ductus arteriosus-PDA ) require catecholamine treatment , clinical evidence seizure ongoing sepsis ( positive blood culture ) study , within 24 hour prior enrollment , exclude . Study product : AVEA ventilator closed-loop inspired oxygen control ( CLiO2 ) automate FiO2 control option . An additional sensor attach infant 's forehead continuous measurement cerebral tissue oxygen saturation ( rStO2 ) 5100C NIRS oximeter , Covidien . Duration:24 hour manual control CLiO2 control . Reference therapy : Manual control FiO2 provide accord standardize guideline . Statistical Methodology : repeat measure mixed linear model control sequence ventilation mode . Concurrent safety oversight : Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board , blind review every 6 month 50 % enrollment , 15 subject .</detailed_description>
