	<brief_title>The Assessment Patient Specific Instrumentation Unicompartmental Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim prospective study compare accuracy implantation functional outcome mobile bear medial Unicompartmental Knee Replacements implant without patient specific instrumentation experience Unicompartmental Knee Replacement surgeon . This single-centre parallel-design trial conduct March 2012 March 2014 Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre , Oxford . Four expert knee surgeon perform procedure study . Patients place wait list medial Unicompartmental Knee Replacement , meet entry criterion trial , ask see would willing receive information participation study . They provide study information leaflet could read time . A member research team subsequently contact patient order determine would agree take part study enrol onto study . Patients randomize either Patient Specific Instrumentation , Conventional Instrumentation group . There 23 patient ( 23 knee ) Patient Specific Instrumentation group 22 patient ( 22 knee ) Conventional Instrumentation group . Randomization perform use seal opaque envelope . Concealment operate surgeon patient possible owe surgeon need confirm Patient Specific Instrumentation plan , patient undergo pre-operative MRI scan . Patient Specific Instrumentation group patient underwent MRI scan use protocol outline Patient Specific Instrumentation manufacturer plan development Patient Specific Instrumentation guide . The preliminary plan indicate prosthesis size , positioning , alignment , propose bone resection level review surgeon accept default preoperative plan unless gross error present . The patient specific cut block manufacture sent sterilization . Operative Technique : All patient receive mobile bear medial Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement via minimally invasive approach general anaesthetic , high thigh tourniquet . Intra-operatively , bone cut make Patient Specific Instrumentation guide without use intra extra-medullary instrumentation femoral side tibial extramedullary guide case . The subsequent milling process soft tissue balance perform manually standard fashion . Post-operatively , need blood transfusion , change haemoglobin level also record . Oxygen saturation level first 24 hour post surgery also record . Screened anteroposterior lateral post-operative radiograph perform prior discharge . Patients attend physiotherapy ward discharge clinic six week . A clinical review perform 12 month point Oxford Knee Scores record . The primary outcome measure radiological assessment component positioning . ( See Outcome measure section detail ) Target sample size : The sample size calculate previous study use similar radiological assessment compare unicompartmental knee replacement perform use conventional instrumentation , perform use computer navigation . In study , standard deviation tibia varus/valgus angle control group 3.6° . Assuming minimum clinically important difference 3° , standard mean difference would 0.8 . Hence power 0.8 significance level 0.05 , total sample size 44 patient ( 22 group ) require .</detailed_description>
