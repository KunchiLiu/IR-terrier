	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-041 . TAK-041 test evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single multiple dos TAK-041 healthy participant . The study enroll approximately 40 participant . The study compose 2 part . Part 1 ( single-rising dose [ SRD ] , alternate panel design ) Part 2 ( multiple-rising dose [ MRD ] , sequential panel design ) . Part 1 consist 2 cohort , participant randomly assign one two treatment sequence 4 3 period cohorts 1 2 respectively : - TAK-041 5-400 mg - Placebo ( inactive ) - similar formulation look like study drug active ingredient . Part 2 consist 3 cohort , participant randomly assign one two treatment . Dose level duration Part 2 base emerge safety/tolerability PK data Part 1 . - TAK-041 - Placebo This single center trial conduct United States . Participants remain confined study site check-in ( Day -1 ) Days 5 period part 1 Day 18 Part 2 . Participants contact telephone 14±2 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
