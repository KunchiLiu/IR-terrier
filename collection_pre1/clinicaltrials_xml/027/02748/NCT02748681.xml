	<detailed_description>The investigator intend perform single-blind , mono-center , randomize control trial standard CPAP treatment compare CPAP treatment telemedicine monitoring system stroke patient moderate severe OSA . Patients accept CPAP therapy successful titration randomize either standard care telemedicine group ( 1:1 ratio ) subsequently inform study arm homecare provider . The study approve Clinical Research Ethics Board public health service Vienna . Written inform consent examination obtain upon patient ` admission . If patient agree undergo CPAP monitoring , informed consent obtain . The study perform accordance relevant guideline Declaration Helsinki , 1964 , amend Tokyo , 1975 , Venice , 1983 , Hong Kong , 1989 , Somerset West , 1996 . Screening Sleep Studies Over four eight week neurorehabilitation , stroke patient ( 19-70 yr age ) offer nocturnal respirographic screen evaluation SA ( see study flow chart ) . Within study period investigator expect screen 170 patient per year . Diagnosis sleep apnea referral CPAP training : SA referral CPAP training base AHI ≥ 15/h sleep , recommend international task force standardization definition sleep-related breathing disorder indicate moderate SA . If screening type-3 polygraphy reveals AHI ≥ 15 ≤ 30/h record time subjective sleep time concomitant sleep log le 4 hour , non-attended polysomnography perform confirm diagnosis SA . If type-3 polygraphy show AHI ≥ 30/h recording time , patient directly refer CPAP therapy . Polysomnography polygraphy perform trained staff member use Somnomedics Diagnostic Systems ( SOMNOmedics GmbH , Germany ) . Patients study hospital bed . Polygraphic polysomnographic all-night recording accord AASM standard criterion obtain approximately 22.00 ( lights-out ) 6.00 ( buzzer alarm clock ) . Thus , time bed ( TIB ) fix 7.5 hour . Polygraphic record include nasal air flow , snore train , thoracic abdominal effort , oxyhemoglobin saturation , determination body position . Recordings use investigation least 4 h data obtain . EEG sleep data include 6 EEG channel ( F3-A2 , F4-A1 , C3-A2 , C4-A1 , O1-A2 , O2-A1 ) accord 10/20 system , 2 electrooculogram ( EOG ) channel ( left/right ) , submental electromyogram ( EMG ) tibialis anterior electromyogram leg ( EMG ) score manually . Systolic BP determine mean non-linear algorithm individual one-point calibration pulse transit time obtain cuff-based BP measuring device ( SOMNOmedics GmbH , Germany ) . The number systolic rise ( define &gt; 15mmHg ) relation respiratory event maximum systolic blood pressure determine . Patients ask complete Self-Assessment Scale Sleep Awakening Quality ( SSA ) accord Saletu et al . ( 1987 ) . Polygraphic data recording manually score apnea hypopnea accord criterion develop American Academy Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) . For score event hypopnea , 30 % reduction nasal flow associate oxygen desaturation least 3 % require . The AHI define sum apnea hypopneas occur per hour recording time . CPAP Protocol All patient refer CPAP therapy receive 60-min PAP training . A nasal oronasal mask fit patient 's face PAP coordinator center , trained respiratory therapist ESRS-certified somnologist ( MS ) many year experience sleep apnea patient . Patients provide AirSense™ 10 AutoSet CPAP ( Resmed ) include humifdifier . This auto-titrating device monitor patient ' airflow adjusts pressure automatically eliminate sleep apnea . The AirSense 10 AutoSet able differentiate obstructive central apnea . It set auto-titrate pressure 6 13 cm H2O , reflect current clinical practice . Pressure limit increase 16 cm H2O , decrease small range lead normalize AHI order avoid overtitration . Patients accept CPAP therapy training session motivate use least 4 &gt; hour sleep/night one week . Additional nocturnal pulse oximetry obtain . Patients coach trained nurse night . Relatives also train use humidifier clean mask humidifier chamber . Data card AHI , oximetry leakage information collect every day . Pressure limit increase decrease improve patient comfort . If patient consider interface uncomfortable , may change . After one week , patient median CPAP use &gt; 4/hours undergo unattended CPAP polysomnography . The quality CPAP titration grade follow : optimal ( obstructive AHI ≤ 5/h , supine REM sleep treatment pressure ; desaturation index≤ 5/h sleep ) , good ( obstructive AHI &lt; 10/h , REM sleep treatment pressure , desaturation index≤ 10/h ) , adequate ( AHI &lt; 10/h , supine NREM sleep treatment pressure , desaturation index≤ 10/h ) . A persisting central AHI &lt; 5 tolerate . If none criterion meet , patient refer conventional attended CPAP polysomnograpy exclude study . Patients chose participate telemetric study part ask sign inform consent randomize either standard care telemedicine group ( 1:1 ratio ) use sequentially number envelope prepare CPAP homecare provider . After receive prescribed CPAP device homecare provider inform group . Study staff perform sleep recording clinical rating blind study arm . In case treatment pressure change doctor inform study arm . Clinical Scales In study arm patient ask complete follow scale : ESS ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) SSA ( Self-Assessment Scale Sleep Awakening Quality accord Saletu et al . 1987 ) QoL ( Quality Life Index accord Mezzich et al . ) BQ ( Berlin Questionnaire ) PAP Satisfaction Questionnaire NIH Stroke Scale ( National Institute Health , National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ) TUG ( Timed Up Go Test ) NHPT ( Nine Hole Peg Test ) BI ( Barthel Index ) Moca Test Outpatient Monitoring Randomization Standard Care Patients contact homecare provider 2 day receive CPAP device ask progress adherence , well problem might occur . After 3 month therapy , patient return hospital see PAP coordinator doctor . Data variety physiological variable , include PAP adherence , PAP pressure apply , mask leakage , residual respiratory event , download CPAP device . Any problem treatment may address . Patients ask complete number clinical scale answer variety survey question concern side effect sleep quality . A non-attended PSG perform patient ' home . Telemedicine Like standard care , patient receive AirSense™ 10 AutoSet CPAP . In addition , telemedicine module PAP device activate homecare provider . The module program send physiological information ( PAP adherence , PAP pressure apply , mask leakage residual respiratory event ) web-based database via GPRS module every day . Patients contact homecare provider 2 day ask progress compliance well problem . The PAP coordinator homecare provider review download information every morning except weekend holiday contact patient follow occur : mask leakage 95 percentile &gt; 24 L/min , &lt; 4 h use two consecutive night , AHI &gt; 10 events/h , 90th percentile pressure &gt; 16 cm H2O . The homecare provider call patient his/her relatives ask symptom dry mouth , mask issue , discomfort device , problem . If issue low adherence due lack motivation , homecare provider encourage patient use PAP . Should problem , homecare provider discus case PAP coordinator ( person see patient standard arm ) arrange patient talk see PAP coordinator , depend patient 's response physiological data obtain . Specific intervention may perform improve compliance consider standard hospital ( e.g. , different mask , chin strap , modification pressure setting , modification humidifier setting , saline nasal spray ) . After 3 month therapy , patient return hospital see doctor data obtain review ( include CPAP pressure , mask leakage , residual respiratory event , compliance ) . Any problem treatment may address . Like standard arm , polysomography perform patient ' home clinical scale complete . Time Spent Patients The time research coordinator PAP coordinator spend patient record write daily log sheet . This include time spent fitting mask , problem solving , talk patient phone , meeting patient , review download transmitted information . Statistical Analyses Statistical analysis perform SPSS version 10 Windows ( SPSS Inc. Chicago , IL , USA ) . All P-values two-sided value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . To examine compare demographic test characteristic inclusion , chi-sqare test , t-test Mann-Whitney U-test independent sample use accord distribution , examine Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test . The primary outcome PAP adherence 3 month ( min use per day ) . To calculate number participant need effect size large 0,80 propose Cohen ( Statistical power analysis behavioural science . 1988 ) , investigator base power calculation result study Fox et al . patient sleep apnea , compare telemedicine versus standard CPAP treatment 3 month . The result calculation 11 patient one group . Considering patient discontinue CPAP treatment , investigator aim include 55 patient randomisation process . Based previous data investigator consider 168 patient include screen process sleep apnea . Clinical variable correlate compliance data .
