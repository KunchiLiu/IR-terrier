	<brief_summary>An observational , retrospective , multicenter , blind adjudication study evaluate clinical appropriateness Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) indication execution patient stable Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) patient acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation ( NSTE-ACS ) ( ratio 4:1 ) . Half include patient diabetic . Also implementation select , key guideline recommendation examine . At least 400 patient retrospectively select among 22 Catheterization Laboratories Italy region Lombardia Veneto . This study conduct compliance Good Clinical Practices ( GCP ) include Declaration Helsinki applicable regulatory requirement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A strategy base early invasive coronary angiography follow revascularization effective treatment patient acute coronary syndrome , especially ST-segment elevation ( STE-ACS ) . In patient acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation ( NSTE-ACS ) , early invasive strategy associate reduction cardiac death myocardial infarction patient high risk . In stable coronary artery disease rather data convincing . The undeniable evolution technique PCI accompany parallel progress medical therapy also increase awareness , cardiologists patient , importance control coronary risk factor . European Society Cardiology Guide give precise indication ( often ignore ) use PCI coronary artery bypass graft accord extent coronary artery disease site injury . However , especially patient NSTE-ACS often limit dilate culprit stenosis , leave untreated injury underlie large myocardial territory , , configure incomplete revascularization framework . The calculation SYNTAX score residual ( , remain percutaneous revascularization procedure ) allow objectively verify incompleteness PCI treatment , correlate outcome patient 's distance . Moreover , case equivocal stenosis , especially patient stable coronary disease , large use functional assessment use calculation Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR ) . This could indicate increase number invasive diagnostic test increase number patient coronary artery disease extend , usually indicated surgical revascularization . So identify patient high risk , may enough specific investigation conduct selectively . The purpose pilot study APACHE ass appropriateness indication appropriateness execution sample carry PCI patient stable coronary artery disease patient NSTE-ACS ( ratio 4 : 1 ) . As , APACHE consider quality improvement initiative . Retrospective observational study , multicenter . The study population consist 20 case PCI per center ( 400 PCI total ) select randomly within center case study previous approval study . Of 16 patient stable coronary artery disease ( include 8 diabetes mellitus medical therapy ) 4 patient NSTE-ACS ( 4 : 1 ratio ) . Patients history coronary artery bypass exclude . The series consist patient procedure carry previous year declaration participation survey case publication document . There previous analysis type Italy therefore known rate inappropriateness PCI procedures stable patient . It possible therefore perform calculation sample size . However , investigator believe pilot analysis , initial sample 400 PCI procedure , analytically consider , sufficient verify magnitude problem Italian Catheterization Laboratories . The investigator anticipate participation 20 center total Lombardia Veneto italian region . The study approximate duration 2 year . The data collect different patient nSTE - ACS compare patient stable coronary artery disease . As initiative quality improvement , accord extensive international literature subject , request individual informed consent select patient approval Ethics Committee Center Coordinator . Patient data de-identified used aggregate individual sensitive information ( name , phone , address ) erase .</detailed_description>
