	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study best dose aldesleukin give together pembrolizumab see well work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma . Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell melanoma cell . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving aldesleukin pembrolizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aldesleukin Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine optimal tolerate dose ( OTD ) aldesleukin ( interleukin [ IL ] -2 ) effective tolerable combination pembrolizumab . II . To characterize efficacy OTD IL-2 combination pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety IL-2 dose range Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) - approve dose administer combination pembrolizumab . II . To characterize clinical endpoint , include overall survival , progression-free survival , complete response rate . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize immune parameter blood tumor microenvironment cellular molecular feature tumor tissue correlate response combination therapy study potential predictive biomarkers . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 every 3 week aldesleukin IV every 8 hour 14 dos week 4 , 7 , 16 , 19 , 28 , 31 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
