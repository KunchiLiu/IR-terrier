	<brief_summary>Primary Objective study : To assess experimental heat pain response ( pain intensity , pain unpleasantness , pain catastrophizing , emotional reactivity ) migraineurs vs. healthy control . The current tool migraine pain measurement inadequate distinguish overall burden suffering , reliance single numerical pain score represent entire pain experience . Measuring target affective component , addition sensory component pain , may capture discrepancy disease burden . The affective component migraine pain may important sensory component target measure since significantly impact outcome , disability , therapeutic treatment implication . Quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) robust lab paradigm ( clinical experience ) deliver one painful noxious thermal stimulus ask simultaneous pain intensity pain unpleasantness score . By use research , investigator able differentiate sensory ( pain quality—what pain feel like ) affective ( awful/unpleasant pain feel ) component experimental pain normal control vs. migrainuers . No previous study evaluate difference experimental pain intensity vs. pain unpleasantness migraineurs vs. control . As migraine pain uniquely involve many alter sensory phenomenon ( e.g. , photophobia , phonophobia ) , assumed response experimental pain migraine clinical pain syndrome . Further , different clinical pain syndrome distinct response pain intensity vs. pain unpleasantness .</brief_summary>
