	<brief_title>Early Detection Lymphedema With Bio-Electrical Impedance Analysis Patients After Breast Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphedema characterize accumulation protein rich fluid interstitial space . It also chronic condition need lifelong care . Untreated lymphedema lead chronic inflammation , cellulitis , pain , tiredness , cosmetic deformity , restriction individual 's motion , mobility problem dysfunctional use affect extremity . Undiagnosed lymphedema worsen gradually thus detect lymphedema early stage place matter . It indicate early treatment lymphedema improve treatment outcome . Bio-Electrical Impedance Analysis non-invasive method measure extracellular fluid proportion impedance relate extremity advance low intensity electrical current pass body . It state Bio-Electrical Impedance Analysis measure impedance ratio useful detect lymphedema early stage . Bio-Electrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA ) give important information assessment lymphedema measure directly tissue fluid change . Lymphedema Index ( L-dex ) find divide impedance ratio unaffected extremity affect extremity 's impedance ratio bio-electrical impedance analysis . Impedance extremity lessen develop lymphedema L-dex value get high . Tissue Dielectric Constant ( TDC ) objective non-invasive measurement method evaluate early tissue fluid change . A 300 megahertz signal generate control unit transmit tissue probe . Reflected electromagnetic wave depend dielectric constant tissue . Free bound water molecule proportion tissue effect tissue dielectric constant . Reflected electromagnetic wave process control unit relative tissue dielectric constant calculate . Dielectric constant pure water 78.5 room temperature . The Scale range 1-80 . It state compare affect unaffected extremity regard lymphedema existence TDC measurement , TDC value high 1.2 experimental group . In control group , TDC value low 1.2 . It also emphasize proportion probably valuable assessment upper extremity lymphedema . TDC could do different depth . 0.5 , 1.5 , 2.5 5.0 mm probe possible usage.In study , Moisture Meter-D compact ( MMDc ) device use assessment . It allow evaluation 2.5 mm depth . In study , TDC apply upper extremity affect unaffected side . 6 cm low point cubital crease , 8 cm upper point cubital crease 10 cm low point armpit mark two side soft pen measurement . Between 18-65 year old total 60 woman recruit study 3 separate groups.The first group contain patient breast cancer surgery yet lymphedema . The inclusion criterion involve first group surgery time . No one involve first group surgery apply 18 month ago enrollment study . The second group contain patient breast cancer surgery upper extremity lymphedema . The third group contain healthy woman . The aim study whether BIA TDC method capable detect lymphedema early stage . Measurements do baseline , 6th month 12th month . Exclusion criterion include involuntary recruit study , bilaterally breast surgery history , bilaterally upper extremity lymphedema , active infection , active chemotherapy radiotherapy process , malignity period , mentally cognitive disorder . Lymphedema treatment may quite costly due material use treatment special producted compression stocking . If take account compression stock must change every six month , carry much importance regard cost-effectivity prevent lymphedema manifesting.Even lymphedema manifest already , detect lymphedema early stage aggravation improve treatment outcomes individual 's quality life .</detailed_description>
