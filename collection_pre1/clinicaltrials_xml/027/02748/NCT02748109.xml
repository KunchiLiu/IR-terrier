	<brief_summary>Our central hypothesis chronic balance deficit mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) result impairment central sensorimotor integration ( CSMI ) may help rehabilitation . There two objective proposal ; first objective characterize balance deficit people mTBI . The second objective use novel auditory bio-feedback ( ABF ) device improve measure central sensorimotor integration balance control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : This study two part : 1 ) Cross-sectional study ( Aim I : Balance Assessment ) identify characterize maladaptive balance control strategies mTBI compare healthy control 2 ) Interventional randomize pilot study ( Aim II : Balance Rehabilitation ) use novel ABF rehabilitation technique ameliorate maladaptive balance control strategies TBI . Subjects Aim II subset Aim I study occur simultaneously . Plan : The propose 4-year study two part : 1 ) Cross-sectional study ( Aim I : Balance Assessment ) identify characterize maladaptive balance control strategies mTBI compare healthy control 2 ) Interventional randomize pilot study ( Aim II : Balance Rehabilitation ) use novel ABF rehabilitation technique ameliorate maladaptive balance control strategies TBI . Subjects Aim II subset Aim I study occur simultaneously . Methods : I ) Balance Assessment : To characterize balance deficit people mTBI chronic , non-resolving balance deficit compare healthy control subject without history mTBI . We hypothesize ) objective measure central sensorimotor integration , static dynamic balance well distinguish people mTBI control subject clinical measure , b ) subset people mTBI abnormal central sensori-motor integration ( CSMI ) test measure , even without peripheral vestibular ocular motor deficit c ) relationship poor static/dynamic balance performance mTBI regulated/mediated CSMI . We test 130 subject age 18 60 ; 65 chronic ( &gt; 3 month ) mTBI non-resolving balance deficit 65 healthy age gender match control subject without history mTBI . We obtain objective measure static dynamic balance use wearable inertial sensor determine measure relate central sensorimotor integration . We also obtain laboratory measure peripheral vestibular function ocular motor function help classify people consider potential covariates rehabilitation efficacy . II ) Balance Rehabilitation : To determine efficacy novel , ABF balance rehabilitation program improve central sensorimotor integration , static dynamic balance , functional activity patient chronic mTBI . We hypothesize ) CSMI score improve rehabilitation ABF increase improvement CSMI score beyond standard care , b ) ABF intervention improve objective summary measure balance c ) people central sensorimotor integration impairment show sustain improvement CSMI score balance rehabilitation . We randomize 40 subject age 21 50 ; 65 chronic ( &gt; 3 month ) mTBI non-resolving balance deficit Aim I abnormal CSMI either ABF rehabilitation group standard care group . People test 6-week intervention period 6 week later determine long-term change . Normal/abnormal vestibular ocular motor function use covariates determine peripheral deficit affect efficacy ABF rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
