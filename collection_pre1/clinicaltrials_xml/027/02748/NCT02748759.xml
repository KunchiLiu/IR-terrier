	<brief_summary>Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) injuries trauma prevalent pathology . In USA , 200.000 injury estimate per year , half implicate total rupture ligament . Data indicate number ACL injury increase young athlete present common problem , especially people play agility sport . One widely use method post-surgical mobilization ACL use Continuous Passive Motion ( CPM ) device . These machine mean drain residual fluid articulation maintain mobility joint muscle knee . Even though study show , early mobilization surgery beneficial rehabilitation knee joint , recent study question efficiency CPM compare goal application . While literature suggest efficacy CPM related magnitude knee flexion Range Motion ( ROM ) achieve study show range motion measure CPM considerably less actual ROM . As therapy provide effective mobilization knee joint , Specific Manual Physical Therapy method ( Kaltenborn method ) take account physiological combination rotation glide two joint surface . This technique mobilize femorotibial joint control tibial plateau anteroposterior flexion posteroanterior extension knee . Therefore , past 30 year study compare ROM measurement obtain CPM manual physical therapy method . It hypothesize benefit early passive mobilization ACL reconstructive surgery diminish limited efficacy currently use CPM device . The aim study determine range motion achieve passive mobilization use CPM device compare manual method ( Kaltenborn method ) ass ROM measurement provide CPM correlate real ROM .</brief_summary>
