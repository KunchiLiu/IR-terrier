Pubertal , Tanner stage &gt; 1 Subjects must willing comply study protocol requirement Females must negative pregnancy test within 72 hour prior start study every subsequent study visit . If visit pregnancy test positive ask continue study . If adolescent use contraception birth control pills allow continue use study affect glucose level . Once female confirm pregnant take insulin pump restart insulin injection regimen start study . We also make aptt `` high risk obstretics '' encourage adolescent check blood sugar least 46 time per day . The patient must insulin qualify study . The adolescent could oral hypoglycemic agent addition insulin include study . Chart review adolescent T2DM do confirm absence glutamic acid decarboxylase , islet cell insulin autoantibody secondary cause diabetes Other significant major organ system illness Females pregnant initial assessment . We test female participant every visit urine pregnancy test find pregnant ask stop use pump go back use insulin injection . Significant psychiatric illness : schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , active substance abuse uncontrolled major depression . All adolescent sign renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance base Schwartz equation &gt; 0.55 female male 0.7 age 1318 year ) ( 13 ) . Serum creatinine available metabolic profile .
