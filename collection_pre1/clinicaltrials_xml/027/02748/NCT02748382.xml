	<brief_summary>Despite evidence physiologic benefit possible low mortality associate low chloride solution , normal saline remain wildly use fluid world . Given uncertainty impact lower chloride versus high chloride solution mortality , unlikely clinical practice change without new direct RCT evidence . Editorials publish lead critical care journal call RCT 's address important clinical question . The propose feasibility RCT investigate feasibility large-scale trial directly compare low chloride versus normal chloride resuscitation septic shock patient-important outcome mortality AKI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe infection lead many complication within human body include low blood pressure , call septic shock . The main treatment septic shock intravenous antibiotic intravenous fluid . There many different intravenous fluid available doctor use . Each one fluids potential advantage well potential disadvantage . Doctors often look many thing decide fluid give include result bloodwork clinical characteristic patient . There limited direction research study taht use one fluid type well another . Some preliminary research field suggest one specific electrolyte , call chloride , may harmful give patient high concentration . Animal research show administration high chloride fluid may harmful lung , kidney , gastrointestinal muscle cell . Some intravenous fluid high concentration chloride others . The investigator plan study impact give patient severe infection intravenous fluid either high chloride concentration ( normal saline high chloride albumin ) low chloride concentration ( Ringers Lactate low chloride albumin ) . Although , investigator plan large trial look patient-important outcome rate death , kidney failure length stay ICU investigator think 's important start feasibility study . If investigator able show large trial feasible investigator apply fund use lesson learn pilot optimize large study . The large study potential guide care critically ill patient infection worldwide .</detailed_description>
