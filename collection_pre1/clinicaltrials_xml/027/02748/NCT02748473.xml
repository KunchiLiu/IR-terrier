	<brief_title>Effectiveness Adding Voluntary Pelvic Floor Muscle Contraction Pilates Exercises Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : The purpose study evaluate effectiveness add voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction ( PFMC ) contraction Pilates exercise program sedentary nulliparous woman . Methods : Fifty-seven healthy nulliparous physically inactive woman randomize Pilates exercise program ( PEP ) without PFMC . Forty-eight woman conclude study ( 24 participant group ) . Every woman evaluate PEP , one physiotherapist urogynecologist ( UG ) . Both professional reveal . This physiotherapist measure pelvic floor muscle strength use , perineometer ( Peritron ) vaginal palpation ( Oxford Scale ) . The UG , perform 3D perineal ultrasound exam , collect data evaluate result pubovisceral muscle thickness levator hiatus ( LA ) area . Both professional masked group allocation . The protocol group consist 24 bi-weekly 1-h individual session Pilates exercise , develop another physiotherapist specialize PFM rehabilitation Pilates technique . Group I : Pilates exercise program ( PEP ) , involve Pilates exercise protocol without instruction voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction . I word , researcher , circumstance , never explain anything voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction Pilates exercise performance . Group II : Pilates exercise program voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction ( PEP+PFMC ) compose Pilates exercise program voluntary pelvic floor contraction . This include maximum contraction pelvic floor muscle expiratory period 5 repetition alternately , thus avoid muscle exhaustion pelvic floor could happen .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>healthy woman ( without gynecologic/neurologic disease ) sedentary woman ( practice regularly physical activity ) nulliparous , reproductive age history pelvic floor disorder capable perform correct PFMC .
