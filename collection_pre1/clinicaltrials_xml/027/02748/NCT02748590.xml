	<brief_title>Evaluation Sacral Neuromodulation ( SNM ) Treatment Active Ulcerative Colitis ( PRIMICISTIM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromodulation validate option treatment fecal incontinence . Safety original approach confirm several study . New indication minimally-invasive procedure actually evaluation particularly field irritable bowel syndrome chronic constipation promise result . Its mechanism action remain partially unknown target neuromodulation limit anal sphincter whole colonic motility seem influence therapeutic approach . Moreover , recent experimental study show neuromodulation able reinforce intestinal epithelial barrier involve pathophysiology ulcerative colitis . Subsequently , preliminary result human show improvement inflammation patient suffer inflammatory bowel disease . In fact , despite recent improvement medical therapy inflammatory bowel disease particularly ulcerative colitis , several patient suffer disable chronic active disease . In case refractory disease , alternative treatment pan-proctocolectomy ileal pouch surgery . This approach curative option , lead significant morbidity frequent functional disorder long-term follow-up ( permanent stoma 7 10 % case ) . Moreover , limited distal disease ( left colon rectum ) surgical option seem unadapted many patient remain symptomatic suffer chronic active disease . The aim study assess prospective pilot study efficacy ulcerative colitis induce remission chronic active ulcerative colitis limit left side colon improve quality life patient .</detailed_description>
