	<brief_title>MTX Discontinuation Vaccine Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic systemic inflammatory disease affect joint main target inflammation . Patients RA require chronic treatment disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) include methotrexate ( MTX ) , constitute mainstay treatment . Underlying immune dysfunction additional immune suppression associate treatment render patient RA susceptible infection . Thus , vaccination preventable disease include influenza , pneumococcal pneumonia hepatitis B recommend RA patient subject treatment immunesupprssive drug , unless contraindication use vaccination . However , low dose glucocorticoid , conventional DMARDs biological DMARDs include tumor necrosis factor inhibitor report substantially decrease vaccine response ( 4 ) ; MTX report associate decreased response seasonal influenza vaccination 15 % . To optimize vaccine response , vaccination administrate treatment immunesuppressive medication initiate . However , patient RA already stable dose DMARDs time vaccination , especially vaccine seasonal influenza need annual administration , consider . Alternatively , temporarily discontinuation DMARDs might restore normal immune response improve efficacy vaccination . Although short term discontinuation DMARDs perioperative period associate increased disease activity long discontinuation DMARDs might lead significant aggravation RA disease activity . To optimize vaccine response , short term discontinuation DMARDs could consider approach prof safe effective .</detailed_description>
