	<brief_summary>The prevention treatment diseases via artificial intelligence represent ultimate goal computational medicine . The artificial intelligence systematic clinical application yet successfully validate . Currently , main prevention strategy rare diseases build specialize care center . However , center scatter , coverage insufficient , result inadequate health care among large proportion rare disease patient . Here , investigator use `` deep learning '' create CC-Cruiser , intelligence agent involve three functional network : `` pick-up network '' diagnostics , `` evaluation network '' risk stratification `` strategist network '' provide assist treatment decision . The investigator also establish cloud intelligence platform multi-hospital collaboration conduct clinical trial website-based study validate versatility .</brief_summary>
