	<brief_title>Carboplatin Plus Etoposide With Without MPDL3280A Untreated Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combining standard chemotherapy PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor hold great appeal treatment SCLC . While approach may appropriate many cancer type , SCLC may particularly vulnerable treatment strategy . Early study suggest great efficacy agent target PD-1/PD-L1 tumor mutationally complex , associate tobacco use . SCLC strong association tobacco use indeed , genome-wide sequencing study consistently show SCLC carry one high rate non-synonymous mutation [ 37 , 38 ] . In addition , MPDL3280A safely combine platinum base chemotherapy doublet treatment NSCLC [ 39 ] . Thus , combination carboplatin , etoposide MPDL3280A may significantly improve outcome treatment SCLC .</detailed_description>
