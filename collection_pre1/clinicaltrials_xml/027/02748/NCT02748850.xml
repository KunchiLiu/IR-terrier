	<brief_summary>Aldehyde dehydrogenases ( ALDHs ) cellular enzyme responsible detoxify aldehyde result metabolism endogenous exogenous xenobiotic cellular constituent . Although ALDHs consider play important role tumorigenesis , role ALDH activity cancer stem cell , particularly acute leukemia must specify . Several study show ALDHs potent apoptogenic compound normal cancer cell . Therefore , cell damage increased ALDH activity die apoptosis become highly proliferate . This result plausible mechanism `` evasion apoptosis '' , characteristic share many cancer cell . On basis , propose innovative approach cancer chemotherapy inhibition one protective mechanism apoptosis , ie increase ALDH activity cancer cell put involved overcome lethal effect damage road . ALDHs inhibitor may immediate application anti -cancer vivo ? The limited experimental data obtain far human tumor xenograft immunodeficient mice absence data vivo toxicology allow direct passage clinical trial . Indeed , member ALDH superfamily express constitutively vital organ protect deleterious effect xenobiotics adverse endogenous metabolite . Consequently , ALDHs inhibit , collateral damage normal cell could occur . However , normal cell undergone deleterious exposure , harmful metabolite small quantity , require high level ALDH activity , therefore without harm inhibition cell enzymes . From hematological point view , seem essential test therapeutic index inhibitor ALDH DIMATE normal hematopoietic cell leukemic stem . Indeed , pathophysiology acute leukemia , leukemia stem cell major importance much resistant chemotherapy differentiate cell thus cause high rate relapse observe acute leukemia despite high rate complete remission often obtain . In study , test vitro sensitivity cluster differentiation 4 cluster differentiation 38 ( CD4/CD38 ) highly purified leukemic origin normal DIMATE compound . The objective analyze effect DIMATE parameter proliferation , apoptose , cytokinins secretion change transcriptomic general , order well define therapeutic index compound determine precursory hematopoietic normal leukaemic cellular effect . The reversible cytostatic DIMATE effect normal cell irreversible apoptotic effect cancer cell advantage try eliminate .</brief_summary>
