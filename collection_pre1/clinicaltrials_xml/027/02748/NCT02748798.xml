	<brief_summary>The goal research optimize MRI system obtain ideal lung image use Hyperpolarized ( HP ) Noble Inert Fluorinated Gases contrast agent . Lung coil tune frequency gas use . This study take place TBRHSC Cardiorespiratory Department Research MRI facility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Optimal Parameters Hyperpolarized Noble Gas Inert Fluorinated Gas MRI Lung Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MR image lung obtain use HP 3He , HP 129Xe , inert fluorinated gas essentially show distribution inhale gas inside lung . Measurements perform image provide additional information relate pulmonary function . Participation involve least two study visit . During first visit , participant provide write , informed consent , undergo eligibility screening . Study drug administration , use investigational device , MR image study perform 3T Research MRI Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre ( TBRHSC ) . Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFTs ) perform TBRHSC Registered Respiratory Therapist ( RRT ) MR Tech present duration participant scan . Participants place MRI appropriate chest coil wrap around like vest . Several inhalation procedure carry scan . Participants safety closely monitor throughout entire study .</detailed_description>
