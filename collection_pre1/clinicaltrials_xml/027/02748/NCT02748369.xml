	<detailed_description>The tricarboxylic ( TCA ) Krebs cycle `` central hub cellular metabolism '' take place within mitochondrion . It series sequential chemical reaction generate cellular energy form ATP . In addition , cycle provide intermediate metabolite utilized biosynthesis amino acid fatty acid well reduce agent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NADH ) flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FADH2 ) use numerous biochemical reaction . The dysfunction TCA cycle recognize association neurodegenerative cardiovascular disease , metabolic syndrome , tumorigenesis age . Hence , able measure activity flux TCA cycle either vitro vivo hold significant clinical significance . Almost study base vitro approach except NMRS base study involve multiple non-validated assumption . Various stable isotope label study use estimate TCA cycle flux measure one labelled intermediate metabolite within cycle . Unfortunately , label intermediate often present partial segment cycle due exchange , anaplerosis ( entrance cycle ) , cataplerosis ( export cycle ) incomplete cycling . Though previous isotope label study TCA cycle flux qualitatively informative , many quantitatively inaccurate due unexpected dilution TCA cycle intermediate arise unlabeled precursor . This pilot study establish novel methodology use mass-isotopomer flux analysis infusion 2-13C-Acetate , 2-15N-Glutamine D5-phenylalanine measure vivo TCA cycle flux tissue human being . This study simultaneously determine validity measure TCA cycle flux tissue indirectly dynamic difference enrichment label TCA cycle intermediate arterial venous blood supply particular tissue bed ( i.e . arteriovenous model A-V balance technique ) . We propose measure rate different metabolic reaction within TCA cycle trace position-specific 13C 15N transfer intermediate metabolite order characterize oxidative , anaplerotic , cataplerotic exchange rate across TCA cycle . The use 2-15N-Glutamine specifically allow u determine rate glutamine entry cycle via conversion glutamate , thus provide accurate quantification TCA flux . This methodology validate set control physiologic perturbation human study participant low endogenous insulin level alone combination high glucagon level . Finally , correlative study evaluate mitochondrial activity skeletal muscle tissue , oxygen consumption skeletal splanchnic tissue bed , role circulate exosomes derive arteriovenous circulation skeletal splanchnic tissue bed change whole body metabolome also perform : - First , mitochondrial respiration measure high resolution respirometry ( Oxygraph , Oroboros Instruments , Innsbruck , Austria ) use stepwise protocol evaluate various component electron transport system . Protein content mitochondrial suspension measure use colorimetric assay ( Pierce 660-nm Protein Assay ) . Oxygen flux rate express per tissue-wet weight per milligram mitochondrial protein . - Secondly , reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) emission also evaluate skeletal muscle tissue sample . Briefly , Fluorolog 3 ( Horiba Jobin Yvon ) spectrofluorometer temperature control continuous stir used monitor Amplex Red ( Invitrogen ) oxidation freshly isolate mitochondrial suspension obtain skeletal muscle biopsy . Amplex Red oxidation measure presence glutamate ( 10 mmol/L ) , malate ( 2 mmol/L ) , succinate ( 10 mmol/L ) . The fluorescent signal correct background auto-oxidation calibrate standard curve . The H2O2 production rate express relative mitochondrial protein . - Third , simultaneous assessment oxygen consumption carbon dioxide production determine blood gas measurement arteriovenous sample obtain splanchnic skeletal muscle tissue bed . These assessment perform three time point blood sample assessment correlate measured TCA cycle flux respective tissue bed . - Circulating exosomes also derive arteriovenous sample splanchnic skeletal muscle tissue bed determine intra-exosome proteome metabolome relationship TCA cycle flux respective tissue bed . Incorporation D5-phenylalanine help trace protein formation exosomes . - Finally , change whole body metabolome proteome determine via arteriovenous sample obtain splanchnic skeletal muscle tissue bed also perform correlated TCA cycle flux respective tissue bed .</detailed_description>
