	<brief_summary>The objective proposal test feasibility red blood cell ( RBC ) rejuvenation chronic transfusion sickle cell disease ( SCD ) potential benefit RBC rejuvenation population determine large clinical trial power definitively characterize benefit rejuvenation warrant . This small pilot study see restore important energy molecule ( ATP 2,3 , DPG ) store red blood cell transfuse , rejuvenate solution ( Rejuvesol ) , offer advantage individual standard blood transfusion . Subjects receive either rejuvenate ( R ) standard ( S ) RBCs transfusion 6 transfusion ( approximately 6-month period ) pre-defined order maximize detection signal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood transfusion part standard care individual sickle cell disease . Often transfusions become needed quite frequently . The purpose red blood cell blood deliver oxygen organ tissue body . People sickle cell disease abnormal red blood cell . Stored blood undergoes change may make less effective achieving goal . The purpose study see restore important energy molecule ( ATP 2,3 , DPG ) store red blood cell transfuse , rejuvenate solution ( Rejuvesol ) , offer advantage individual standard blood transfusion . This Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve process describe American Association Blood Banks prolong blood storage use everyday transfusion . The investigator want use process improve blood transfuse individual need frequent transfusion . Potential advantage include good delivery oxygen transfuse red blood cell easier release oxygen tissue . In addition study ass use rejuvenate blood affect interval transfusion . This mean possibly transfusion may need often . Although Rejuvesol previously approve FDA , routinely use prepare standard blood transfusion individual sickle cell disease . Use Rejuvesol study consider investigational .</detailed_description>
