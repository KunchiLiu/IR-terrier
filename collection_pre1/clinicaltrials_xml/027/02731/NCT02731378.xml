	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Iron Supplementation Patients With Chemotherapy-induced Anaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy-induced anaemia ( CIA ) significant health problem patient cancer undergo chemotherapy , cause fatigue reduce quality life ( QoL ) . Up 75 % cancer patient undergo chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy reportedly experience mild-to-moderate anaemia ( defined haemoglobin level 9 11 g/dL ) . In clinical trial , erythropoietin ( EPOs ) show increase haemoglobin level improve anaemia QoL cancer patient . However , recent meta-analyses highlight possible safety issue regard EPO exposure . Preclinical study point towards role EPO augment tumorigenesis , metastasis , risk thrombosis , drug resistance certain tumor type ( e.g. , breast cancer ) , activate important antiapoptotic pathway target current antineoplastic therapy , thus counteract effect . Current guideline western country China recommend restrict usage EPOs reduction / prevention blood transfusion treatment cancer-induced anaemia . However , inadequate response erythropoietic therapy well-characterized rigorous study hence remain poorly handle routine clinical practice . A major cause respond EPO treatment likely functional iron deficiency ( FID ) , defined failure provide iron erythroblast despite sufficient iron store . Patients FID require supplementation usable iron optimize response erythropoietic therapy , might accomplish oral iron . In recent prospective , open-label trial , patient receive epoetin alfa CIA treat IV iron dextran significantly great Hb response compare receive oral iron . Meanwhile , patient CIA iron deficiency , IV iron supplementation significantly reduce treatment failure darbepoetin without additional toxicity . However , whether IV iron supplementation increase risk disease progression , incidence thrombosis heart failure well iron overload , careful investigation . Though association IV iron serious AEs mortality remain unclear , Zitt et al . find use IV iron associate 22 % reduction mortality . Therefore , investigator design multicentre , randomize trial investigate EPOs combination IV iron regard increase Hb level patient inadequate response initial treatment routine dose EPOs .</detailed_description>
