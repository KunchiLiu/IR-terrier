	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery play pivotal role surgical field modern medicine . It well know advantage open surgery . For reason laparoscopic surgery know first choice many surgical procedure , even gynecology . On hand , despite advantage laparoscopy carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) pneumoperitoneum free side effect . Experimental study limit clinical study show pneumoperitoneum lead decrease blood flow intra-abdominal organ laparoscopic surgery . This also know ischemia , lead production free O2 radical . The desufflation abdominal cavity end procedure reduces increase abdominal pressure increase perfusion intra-abdominal organ . However stop production free radical . This reperfusion period even exaggerate release free radical . This phenomenon call ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) model lead release various free radical , important mediator oxidative tissue injury consequential organ dysfunction . Recently oxidative tissue injury consequential dysfunction show ovarian tissue experimental animal study . But data related human ovary still scarce . Thus aim study evaluate effect I/R injury relate CO2 pneumoperitoneum human ovary .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty patient premenopausal period indication hysterectomy benign uterine pathology include study . Patients randomly assign open hysterectomy ( group 1 ) laparoscopic assist vaginal hysterectomy ( group 2 ) . In patient , surgery perform endotracheal general anesthesia mechanical ventilation . Under general anesthesia Arterial blood gas , airway pressure , dynamic pulmonary compliance , peripheral pulse-oximetry , end tidal carbon dioxide pressure level ( set 35 45 mm/hg ) , blood pressure , cardiac rhythm monitor continuously surgery . All patient receive single dose cefazolin sodium prophylactic antibiotic . Low molecular weight heparin give patient . Surgery Group 1 ( open hysterectomy ) After induction anesthesia skin incision first venous blood sample collect . Abdominal access perform Pfannenstiel incision . One ovary excise initial step . Contralateral utero-ovarian ligament bilateral round ligament ligate transect . After identification anterior posterior leaf broad ligament , bladder flap develop bladder move low uterine segment . Bilateral vascular uterine pedicle , sacro uterine ligament ligate transect . After perform circumferential colpotomy vaginal cuff close . At final step , close abdominal incision contralateral ovary excise . Both ovary macroscopically evaluate expert pathologist immediately excision . Before preparation ovary histopathological evaluation , 1 cm3 piece ovary excise biochemical evaluation malondialdehyde ( MDA ) level . Second blood sample collect immediately skin closure . Surgery Group 2 ( LAVH ) After induction general anesthesia skin incision first venous blood sample collect patient . This blood sample reflect baseline status . After umbilical skin incision make , pneumoperitoneum create via veress needle use nonheated ( room temperature ) dry CO2 . A 10 mm trocar insert abdominal cavity umbilical incision optic system . Three 5 mm ancillary trocars insert direct vision . Two low abdominal quadrant one leave side umbilicus . Intraabdominal pressure ( IAP ) pressure set 14 mmHg maintain . Immediately port placement one ovary excise minute . Surgery continue ligate transect contralateral utero-ovarian ligament bilateral round ligament . ( Contralateral infundibulopelvic ligament ( IP ) , contain main vascular supply ovary , ligate transected step , ligate transect IP perform end procedure . ) Anterior posterior leaf broad ligament identify bladder flap develop bladder mobilize low uterine segment . At point pneumoperitoneum release surgical team perform rest procedure vaginally . Before release pneumoperitoneum second blood sample collect reflect ischemic status . Circumferential colpotomy perform bilateral sacro-uterine ligament uterine vascular pedicle ligate transect vaginally . Vaginal cuff close vaginally . At point pneumoperitoneum achieve excise contralateral ovary minute . Before pneumoperitoneum perform third blood sample collect represent reperfusion status . Both ovary macroscopically evaluate expert pathologist immediately excision . Before preparation ovary histopathological evaluation , 1 cm3 piece ovary excise biochemical evaluation malondialdehyde ( MDA ) level . In group , first excise ovary represent baseline status , ovary ( excised end procedure ) expose ischemia reperfusion condition represent I/R status . Plasma MDA 8-hydroxy-2 ' -deoxyguanosine ( 8OHdG ) measure marker oxidative stress . Ovarian tissue MDA level also measure marker tissue oxidative stress . Besides , ovarian histopathological examination perform score oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
