	<brief_summary>The main purpose study collect clinical raw scan data Scanner user feedback use dual energy CT ( compute tomography ) scan mode investigational CT scanner . Additionally , image quality use prototype reconstruction algorithm development evaluate compare standard-of-care image acquire regulatory clear diagnostic CT scanner feasibility assessment engineering development . Compared standard clinical single energy ( kilovolt , kV ) scanning , dual energy ( kV ) scan provide information material composition scan patient may allow improved tissue , tumor characterization , improve image quality .</brief_summary>
