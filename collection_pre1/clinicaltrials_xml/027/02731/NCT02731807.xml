	<detailed_description>This open label , replicate cross-over study eight ( 8 ) subject include men woman ( non childbearing age ) complete period six ( 6 ) week . The supplement TA-65 give subject capsule powder form . TA-65 dietary supplement . The active ingredient isolate root Astragalus specie . The active ingredient proven activate enzyme call telomerase . TA-65 intend supplement diet increase general health telomerase activation . The active ingredient poor oral bioavailability human . The current study aim assess bioavailability active ingredient different formulation design enhance bioavailability . The objective study determine steady state pharmacokinetic profile TA-65 follow oral dose formulate ( powder capsule ) unformulated ( powder ) form assess Cmax , Tmax AUC ( area curve ) . This pilot , open-label , replicate cross-over study evaluate pharmacokinetic profile active ingredient eight subject follow oral intake TA-65 varying formulation dos . The subject expect participate study period 28 day . After initial screening , subject visit study center five different day ( day 1 , day 7 , day 14 , day 21 day 28 ) . During visit , eight subject orally take one five test material . The washout period seven day subject refrain take TA-65 form . Pharmacokinetic sample measurement plasma concentration conduct 12 hour period follow oral dose . Blood withdrawn subject prior intake test material ( 0 hr . ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 12 hour follow oral intake test material . Serum separate blood sample store -20° C. The amount TA-65 serum sample analyze mass spectrometry .</detailed_description>
