	<detailed_description>Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation ( HBPR ) use patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma pulmonary fibrosis . Results HBPR similar observe outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation improvement exercise capacity , symptom quality life . However , HBPR yet investigate patient bronchiectasis , progressive debilitate disease high socioeconomic impact . Objective : To investigate short-and long-term effect home rehabilitation program peripheral muscle strength , functional capacity quality life patient bronchiectasis . Methods : Patients diagnose bronchiectasis recruit Obstructive Diseases Outpatient Clinic Hospital das Clínicas - Medicine School , University São Paulo . Participants randomize two group : control group ( usual care recommendation perform exercise respiratory physiotherapy ) training group , perform aerobic ( step training ) resistance training ( low upper limb ) eight week , three time week . All patient receive phone call week patient allocate train group , additionally , get home visit every 15 day . At baseline , immediately finish six month HBPR patient undergo assessment . Expected result : HBPR positive effect exercise tolerance quality life . Also , study contribute future guideline recommendation HBPR patient bronchiectasis .</detailed_description>
