	<detailed_description>Background : Neck pain costly common problem . Current treatment adequately effective large proportion patient continue experience recurrent pain . Therefore , new treatment strategy investigate attempt reduce disability high cost associate neck pain . Dry needle technique fine needle use penetrate skin , subcutaneous tissue , muscle intent mechanically disrupt tissue without use anesthetic . Dry needle emerge treatment modality widely use clinically address variety musculoskeletal condition . Recent study dry needle mechanical neck pain show decreased pain , increase pain pressure threshold , improve range motion , decrease disability short term . The majority study examine dry needle use method atypical clinical practice ( dry needle sole treatment , few visit common practice ) . None include long-term follow . A clinical trial realistic treatment time frame method consistent clinical practice need examine effectiveness dry needle reduce pain enhance function patient present mechanical neck pain . Purpose : The aim trial examine short long term effectiveness dry needling pain , disability , patient perceive improvement patient neck pain . Design : The investigator conduct randomize single blind placebo control trial accordance CONSORT guideline . All patient mechanical neck pain refer physical therapy screen eligibility criterion . Participants randomize receive 1 ) dry needling , manual therapy , exercise 2 ) sham dry needling , manual therapy exercise . Participants receive 7 treatment maximum 4 week . Methods : The primary outcome disability measure Neck Disability Index . Pain patient perceive improvement also record . Outcome measure assess 4 week , 6 month , 12-months assessor blind group allocation participant determine short long-term treatment effect . Data Analysis : The investigator examine primary aim 2-way repeated-measures analysis variance ( ANOVA ) treatment group subject variable time within-subjects variable . The hypothesis interest 2-way group time interaction . Significance : The successful completion trial provide evidence demonstrate whether dry needle effective management mechanical neck pain use combine treatment approach commonly practice clinically .</detailed_description>
