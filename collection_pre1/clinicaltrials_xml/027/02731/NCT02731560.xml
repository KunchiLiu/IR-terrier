	<brief_title>Rituximab ( RTX ) Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drug ( DMARD ) Non-responders Pakistan : The Pakistan Rituximab Study ( PARIS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolled subject inadequately-controlled RA disease activity level assess initiation therapy interval 6 month 12 month thereafter . Standardized disease activity score like Disease Activity Score-28 ( DAS 28 ) use determine remission otherwise disease . The American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) 20 , 50 70 response score European League Associations Rheumatology ( EULAR ) Response Criteria RA use determine percentage improvement individual subject 's condition interval . The former utilizes set assessment determine , give therapy , 20 , 50 70 % improvement aggregate score compare baseline latter utilizes calculate improvement DAS 28 score determine response treatment good , moderate none . Both validate approve use ACR EULAR respectively . The study enrollment period 1st January 2010 till 31st December 2010 . Observation period 12 month enrollment date subject .
