	<detailed_description>Objective : Compare elective colorectal anastomosis without mechanical bowel preparation outcome , particularly anastomotic leak , surgical site infection , ileum . Materials method : A clinical trial conduct include patient colorectal pathology underwent elective colorectal anastomosis . Patients randomize two group ; mechanical bowel preparation ( Group 1 ) , without mechanical bowel preparation ( Group 2 ) . Surgical , non-surgical outcome evaluate , include anastomotic leak , surgical site infection , ileum , acute kidney injury , pneumonia , mortality . The statistical analysis perform accord nature variable , continuous data use measure central tendency dispersion qualitative data frequency percentage . Inferential analysis student 's t-test , and/or Mann-Whitney 's U test ; chi-square distribution , and/or Fisher 's exact test respectively .</detailed_description>
