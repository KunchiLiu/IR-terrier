	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study allow investigation local field potential ( LFP ) signal patient treat DBS STN . This study identify common LFP biomarkers observe function disease symptom , medication effect , fluctuation disease , change result adjustment current standard practice DBS programming . The data collect LFP marker identify serve guideline future stimulation predict programming .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate local field potential ( LFP ) associate beta , gamma band oscillation correlation disease pathophysiology clinical status patient , potentially determine objective biomarker response deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment . This study aim find evidence change power coherence beta gamma band consistently link DBS adjustment associate clinical effect . This approach significant potential benefit provide foundation close loop DBS therapy patient continuous DBS adjustment . This study use novel bi-directional neural interface system chronically simultaneously record , sense , process telemeter LFP signal DBS electrode ( Rouse et al . 2011 ) study stability subsequent change LFP link clinical state relevant present disorder , DBS stimulation rest motor cognitive task . This investigation conduct Ohio State University .</detailed_description>
