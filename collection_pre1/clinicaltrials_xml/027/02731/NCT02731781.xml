	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major cause disability death among young population . In Pediatric population Head trauma may responsible primary secondary brain damage . Primary brain injury result direct mechanical damage time injury , whereas secondary injury cause cellular damage develop hour day post injury . Intracranial Injury Infants ( III ) may hard diagnose abcence neurological deficit early deterioration . On hand , symptom vomit restlessness may present even case minor head injury , unnesessary scaning ( CT ) may perform many center clinical judgment problematic particular age . Some intracranial injury may imminent , evolve Epidural hematoma ( EDH ) infant , early diagnosis may lifesaving lead excellent outcome . In adult , GCS accept usuful tool emergency evaluation head injure patient . In child , several score introduce , include Children 's Coma Score ( CCS ) , however find problematic use young population , since accurate evaluation communication CCS hard , insufficient relevant parameter uncorporated score may significant importance particular age group . In TINS ( Trauma Infant Neurological Score ) characterize clinical parameter mechanism trauma simplify method . As previously publish , score use u group , retrospective study .

	<brief_title>Trauma Infant Neurological Score ( TINS ) Prognostic Factor Guideline CT Scan Infants 24 Months Old Less</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : 200 infant ( &lt; 2 year old ) enrol study . Clinical data gather emergency room file , case admission discharge letter clinical file . Based current protocol treatment diagnosis child head injury , CT perform accord current axisting protocol . No intervention , image , treatment administer different current protocol use hospital , accord exist guideline . Both TINS Children 's Glasgow Coma Scale ( CCS ) score apply , base clinical data obtain file . If image peformed data recoreded . As child head trauma invite routinely follow-up clinic within 1st year injury , data recoreded well . As violation current treatment protocol , additional exam intervention due study - since data obtain file , inform concent necessary . The data cod treating doctor database coded manner identification child possible statisticians people involve treatment follw . The database use `` filemaker pro '' data base , concequent number infant enrol . The difficulty clinical assessment early diagnosis infant use different version CCS , well know report previously . [ 12-18 ] In series , half patient bring unconscious , whereas two infant CCS score 15 arrival neurologically intact . In patient neurologic deficit full alertness , conservative approach may choose . Conservative treatment acute epidural subdural hematoma rare . [ 20 ] This usually suggested patient small EDH ( less 1 cm thick le 3 cm length anteroposterior plane CT ) . If patient symptomatic , however ( even severe headache present without focal neurologic deficit ) , EDH large 1 cm thick , surgery treatment choice . In infant , symptom always clear unless irritability somnolence observe . Objective sign rather symptom thus may helpful . If conservative treatment choose infant admission , close observation intensive care unit mandatory . Also , case , lack language communication underestimation symptom , repeat CT advise within 12 24 hour , even neurologic deterioration appear . As described , one infant , 7-month-old girl , admit bilateral EDH . Conservative treatment undertaken , close observation ; however , neurologic deterioration subsequent 13 hour . On next morning , repeat CT perform , clearly show enlargement EDH left . The infant take operating room , bilateral craniotomy perform . She discharge within day excellent condition neurologic deficit . In rare example , hematoma grow CT without clinical deterioration , surgery indicate hematoma enlarge . Probably , child would deteriorate certain point enlarge hematoma , avoid routine repeat CT indicate case attempt conservative treatment . General Symptoms Transient loss consciousness always clear age group , lack symptom sign fully awake baby may confuse . [ 3-6,12 ] In series , vomit loss consciousness common . Also , infant significant subgaleal hematoma . In fact , infant , positive parameter CT perform neurosurgeon , consider young age patient . CCS Score Looking prognosis CCS score admission , one may surprise . Of five infant arrive unconscious , three leave hospital neurologically intact . As report previous series , low CCS score infant necessarily indicate poor prognosis gross neurologic deficit discharge . [ 12,13 ] On hand , early diagnosis EDH infant admit good neurologic condition history minor head injury difficult . Neither good condition minor trauma rule intracranial emergency . [ 13,17 ] Mechanism Injury In series , patient fell less 1 , even arrive good neurologic condition , surgical EDH find CT . When mechanism injury fall 1 , clinical presentation much bad , lateralize sign , loss consciousness , high rate posterior fossa hematoma . This show vulnerable infant may compare old child even minor head injury . A relatively high rate posterior fossa EDH find series compare previous report . [ 2-5,15 ] Lag Time An interesting observation lag time find ( 48 hour ) infant time injury admission ER . This common young infant parent first underestimate apparently minor head injury ( fall less 1 ) . These infant eventually bring ER , however , deterioration unusual behavior . Another lag time observed admission ER operation . This lag time probably attributable good neurologic condition infant admission . Less half infant operate immediately arrival within 1 hour presentation ER . This may suggest rather subacute presentation EDH infant compare child adult . It explain either good compliance infant cranium brain , delayed appearance severe symptom , underestimation injury parent doctor well . Scoring Method Infants Several Children 's Coma Scales suggest past [ 1,7-11,21 ] improve neurologic evaluation child compare adult . When applied infant , however , score method may disappoint . An anatomic difference skull size flexibility , well open suture fontanels infant , make dynamic intracranial compartment different old child . They may fragile also compliant . The pathophysiology evolve intracranial bleeding , case EDH , thus may different form time clinical symptom . [ 13,22-24 ] One reason application CCS may inaccurate problematic infant suggest Children 's Coma Scales include parameter difficult interpret score . Examples infant ' interaction examiner , restlessness consolability , difficult evaluation sound cry . The problem great old child infant ' psychomotor development variable ( infant different speed level ) verbal communication incomplete-considerations may influence CCS apply . We think age group , therefore , objective parameter , clear evident examiner , use . The New Trauma Infant Neurologic Score IN 1999 new approach score system propose report Beni Adani et ( Ref 25 ) , necessarily tailor revise Glasgow Coma Scale use different concept evaluate infant . Unlike different version Glasgow Coma Scale , include objective parameter presence lateralizing sign , pupillary abnormality , scalp injury , easy define . Being , opinion , accurate evaluating infant , scale may help early diagnosis intracranial disorder apparently neurologically intact infant may improve estimation prognosis infant apparently low CCS . We first present Trauma Infant Neurologic Score ( TINS ) International Neurotrauma Symposium 1997 ( Table ) . In opinion , TINS include : ( 1 ) Mechanism trauma ( T ) ; ( 2 ) whether infant intubate ( I ) , intubation make proper neurologic assessment difficult ; ( 3 ) three neurological ( N ) parameter ( alertness vs. coma , lateralize sign , pupillary abnormality ) ; ( 4 ) scalp injury ( S ) . The TINS suggest simple apply , short , clear , scale 1 10 point . For `` bad '' parameter , infant earn one point . Because TINS apply trauma case , minimal score 1 point ( minor trauma ) ( see Table 3 ) . For severe mechanism trauma ( 2 point ) , include fall 1 , penetrate injury , motor vehicle crash , severe blow injury head . The maximal TINS , bad possible , would 10 . Based preliminary experience unpublished data , assume TINS &lt; 4 predictive good prognosis , TINS 4 7 indicates moderate disability , TINS &gt; 8 would suggest poor prognosis . As guideline CT infant trauma , TINS 2 would indication , opinion CT. Of course , patient high risk ( infant hematologic oncologic disease ) , CT perform case . We think TINS another Glasgow Coma Scale score child , emphasize unique aspect clinical presentation vulnerability infant . The usefulness reliability suggest TINS still determine prospective study infant head trauma intracranial injury . Using different concept building score infant , however , hope provide well clinical prognostic tool particular population .</detailed_description>
