	<detailed_description>The aim study examine Salovum , anti-secretory factor ( AF ) , reduce level intraocular pressure ( IOP ) eye patient affect glaucoma . Glaucoma complex chronic eye disease damage optic nerve . Beginning periphery vision field , often progress slowly , mean patient consult doctor damage become large . Glaucoma require lifelong medical treatment . Regardless medical treatment , damage nerve fiber never regenerate . An early onset medical treatment crucial avoid progression disease , treat , would also affect central vision , result patient severe handicap . One main risk factor glaucoma elevate IOP treatment aim reduce progression IOP lowering . About 10-15 % glaucoma patient follow medically correct treatment respond poorly medicine , lead progressive loss visual field increasingly defective eyesight . Anti-secretory factor ( AF ) endogenous protein characterize vivo vitro . AF part proteasome control transport water ion across cell membrane . AF play important part immune system anti-secretory anti - inflammatory effect vivo along complementary substance , primarily c3C . Researchers chemically characterize clone AF 's cDNA show active part ( anti-secretory anti-inflammatory ) locate amino terminal portion protein . The exact mechanism behind AF 's regulatory effect secretory / inflammatory progress , however , largely unknown , AF probably involve liquid transport mechanism cell pathway . AF detect body tissue , plasma , breast milk , bile faeces . In healthy individual , AF occur principally inactive form , AF activate disease , e.g . toxin-induced diarrhea . The transition inactive active AF contribute normalization intestinal secretion diarrhea decrease cease . In human being , AF therapy reduce disease symptom ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , Meniere 's disease , mastitis ( inflammation mammary gland ) diarrhea condition different genesis . AF treatment particularly successful treatment child 's diarrhea routinely use Pakistan . No side effect therapy far report . Experiences rat also show AF effective lowering pressure tissue tumor ( breast cancer ) , lower elevate intracranial pressure arise connection virus-induced inflammation brain ( herpesvirus type 1 ) , reduce pressure cause mechanical brain damage mimic stroke ( frost damage ) . By give egg-producing hen special feed , hen ' production AF stimulate . The high content AF specifically reflect egg yolk level 10,000 time higher normal egg . The AF enrich egg yolk subject spray-drying seal bag contain 4 gr . This product name Salovum register food specific medical purpose regulatory authority EU . However , Salovum use patient diagnose suspected egg allergy . The investigator ' hypothesis Salovum restore normal salt-water balance eye , turn would lower IOP . This would eliminate reduce risk subsequent visual impairments/neurological damage . It context important point intake Salovum count food way interfere conventional medical management glaucoma . Fifty glaucoma patient despite adequate medication need additional IOP lowering recruit . Participants randomly divide 2 group 25 patient treat accord following : - one group begin Salovum 2 week take placebo another 2 week - one group begin placebo 2 week take Salovum 2 week . Dosage : Salovum dissolve juice water may give rise certain satiety . Each bag contain 4 gr dry egg yolk . The first 2 day , patient take one bag Salovum placebo 6 time day , bag 5 time daily 3 day finally bag 4 time daily 9 day . The eye high IOP select . If eye IOP , right eye choose . IOP measure accord Goldmann applanation tonometry five time study period . IOP measure three time per session three measurement use statistical analysis . IOP also measure self-tonometer patient 5 time daily . Patients get detailed information handle self-tonometer study staff . All result store St Erik Eye Hospital computer system limited access . During study , patient continue take glaucoma treatment usual . Except drink Salovum measure IOP , new routine encounter . As study compare placebo ( egg yolk low level AF ) active treatment ( Salovum high dose AF ) within sick patient population , healthy subject include study . If IOP lower effect achieve Salovum , investigator discuss patient treatment continue . If effect obtain , patient continue usual medical treatment .</detailed_description>
