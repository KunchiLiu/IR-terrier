	<brief_title>Effectiveness Intensive Rehabilitation Advanced Stages Parkinson 's Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterize motor non-motor symptom . Dopamine replacement therapy ( DRT ) standard treatment motor symptom PD , however DRT reduce axial PD symptom freeze gait , postural instability balance disturbance . Further , long-term DRT could negatively impact cognitive motivational function lead different motor behavioural side effect . Therefore , pharmacological approach become less effective moderate advance stage disease . The investigator test hypothesis approach effectiveness also moderate advance stage disease In accord Hoehn Yahr scale ( H &amp; Y ) identify 353 parkinsonian patient stage 3 , 79 subject stage 4 7 subject stage 5 . Clinical score assess baseline 4 week neurologists physiotherapist expert movement disorder . All evaluation perform morning , one hour take drug . The assessment include : Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , clinical evaluation , Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , Timed Up Go Test ( TUG ) , Six Minutes Walking Test ( 6MWT ) , Freezing Gait Questionnaire ( FOGQ ) Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale ( AIMS ) motor symptoms evaluation , finally , Parkinson 's Disease Disability Scale ( PDDS ) , evaluation functional impact disease . Since advanced stage PD one troublesome complication include cognitive disorder , Neuropsychologist perform cognitive assessment admission . The neuropsychological profile explore use Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , tool screen cognitive impairment , Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB ) evaluation frontal lobe dysfunction .</detailed_description>
