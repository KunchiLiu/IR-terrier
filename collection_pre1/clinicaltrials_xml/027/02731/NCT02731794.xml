	<brief_title>On-pump Beating Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Ventricular Assist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) tend low incidence postoperative complication remarkable advantage term hospital stay . However , drawback include high rate incomplete revascularization hemodynamic deterioration manipulation heart , occur case posterolateral anatomical constraint cardiac dysfunction . It lead urgent conversion extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) increase mortality . Although conventional ECC cardioplegia arrest provide bloodless immovable field , intense systemic inflammatory response may contribute hemodynamic unstability especially patient already severe cardiac dysfunction . On-pump beating CABG , comprehensive approach , facilitate stable hemodynamics complete revascularization , also support myocardial lymphatic flow balance decrease interstitial myocardial edema beat state . Especially high-risk patient , finding suggest off-pump CABG convert on-pump beating CABG without hesitation , avoid hemodynamic collapse even catastrophic outcome . Some investigator intentionally plan on-pump beating CABG aim patient severe left ventricle dysfunction . Furthermore , on-pump beating CABG ECC assistance high-risk subgroup also acceptable trade-off conventional cardioplegia off-pump operation . The above-mentioned ECC result on-pump , beating-heart CABG pay much attention biventricular assist ( BiVA ) . Nonetheless , much evidence also reveal BiVA trigger intense inflammatory response due extracorporeal membrane lung circuit line . Comparatively speak , single leave ventricular assist ( LVA ) , short circuit line , less priming volume free extracorporeal membrane lung , theoretically reduce inflammatory response relative complication . As result , aim high-risk patient severe left ventricle dysfunction , need ECC assistance ( BiVA LVA ) , investigator design randomized prospective study evaluate : 1 ) difference myocardial injury express cardiac Troponin I ( cTnI ) inflammatory response C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , 2 ) difference early postoperative outcome include graft number , incidence atrial fibrillation , in-hospital mortality ICU stay .</detailed_description>
