	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury lead cause death disability young adult . Green tea Epigallocatechin -3-gallate ( EGCG ) supplementation might favorably influence many process mention secondary insult TBI include neuroinflammation antioxidative damage . The investigator aim investigate whether treatment Epigallocatechin -3-gallate favorably affect outcome traumatic brain injury patient . Therefore , current randomize double-blind clinical trial , 30 patient ( 15 patient group ) moderate severe head trauma admit university hospital intensive care unit include . Patients either receive daily oral dose 400 mg EGCG placebo 7 day . The major outcome include duration mechanical ventilation , Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) , S100 protein level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Epigallocatechin -3-gallate Supplementation Traumatic Brain Injury Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male patient ( 16-65 year old ) admit university hospital intensive care unit moderate severe Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) enrol use consecutive sampling . Inclusion criterion GCS 4-12 , enteral nutrition start 24 hour admission , mechanical ventilation . The procedure protocol study approve Ethic Committee Tehran University Medical Sciences . Written inform consent obtain patient 's relative . After record anamnesis , patient examine physically . Urgent action do , simple radiography take skull CT-scan perform necessary . Patients internal bleeding , obvious fracture limb , history metabolic psychiatric disorder , alcohol drug dependency , underlying disease , vegetarian diet would exclude study . Patients ' base line information include age , sex , vital sign , GCS , clinical symptom time reception , diagnosis base CT-scan , type treatment ( medicinal surgical ) surgical area body record . patient divide two experimental group : ( 1 ) receive epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) supplement ( case group , n = 15 ) ( 2 ) receive placebo ( control group , n = 15 ) . EGCG supplement form 400 mg oral capsule purity 80 % catechin . EGCG powder capsule dissolve 10 ml deionized water give patient via gavage ( 1 capsule per day ) week . Placebo group receive 10 ml deionized water via gavage week . During week , GCS patient record neurosurgery resident blind . For seven day , vital sign , glucose , hematocrit , haemoglobin , platelet record every day 9:00 a.m . Duration connection mechanical ventilation also record . In order analyze serum S100B protein level , 5 ml serum take patient 1st day 8th day admission store -80‚Å∞C . Human S100B ELISA kit use quantify level S100B protein . Statistical analysis distribution continuous variable assess use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Normal distribute variable compare independent sample t-test . Not-normal distributed variable assess Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-test . P value less .05 would consider statistically significant test . Data analyze use SPSS Statistics version 21 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , USA ) .</detailed_description>
