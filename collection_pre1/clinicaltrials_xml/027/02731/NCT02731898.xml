	<brief_title>Fourth International Study Mechanical Ventilation From VENTILA GROUP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation commonly use patient admit intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . Clinical study investigate aspect associate utilization , contribute improve knowledge management patient acute respiratory failure . In 1998 , main researcher conduct first international study mechanical ventilation , include 5183 patient mechanically ventilate long 12 hour . Six year later , investigator carry second international study mechanical ventilation include 4968 patient . These study allow analyze evolution mechanical ventilation judge concordance practice result randomize trial . The main finding study high degree concordance observe change mechanical ventilation practice change predict report randomize controlled trial . However , despite apparently beneficial change ventilatory practice , result able detect significant difference clinical outcome time period . These result serve updated benchmark usual care outcomes mechanically ventilaed patient 'real-world ' setting . Lastly , 2010 main researcher finish Third International Study Mechanical Ventilation able find , first time , significant reduction ICU mortality mechanically ventilated patient . Then , investigator propose lead fourth-international study mechanical ventilation . This study keep methodology prospective , international multicenter non interventional single-cohort study , enroll consecutive patient receive mechanical ventilation ( invasive noninvasive ventilation ) least 12 hour 1-month period , follow patient duration mechanical ventilation , 28 day . Despite current implementation different ventilatory strategy , new ventilatory modality , mortality clinical outcome critically ill patient mechanical ventilation poorly know world . The aim study : 1 . To evaluate impact clinical outcome ventilate patient world ; determine factor associate clinical outcome ventilate critically ill patient 2 . To analyze aspect related process liberation mechanical ventilation ; 3 . To determine clinical outcome patient failure noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) ICU ; 4 . To evaluate difference may occur geographical area ventilatory management mechanically ventilate patient . 5 . To describe clinical outcome specific population critically ill patient need mechanical ventilation : 5.a : Outcomes prolong mechanically ventilated patient . 5.b : Prevalence delirium mechanically ventilated patient . 5.c : Performance tracheostomy outcome tracheostomized patient . 5.d : Outcomes mechanically ventilated patient due neurologic disease . 5.f : Outcomes mechanically ventilated patient due chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 5.g : Outcomes mechanically ventilated patient due acute renal failure . 5.h : Outcomes mechanically ventilated patient due hypercapnia patient acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . 5.i : Prediction Prevalence ICU acquire weakness ( ICUAW ) mechanically ventilated patient . 5.j : Clinical Outcomes associate factor reintubation ventilate patient . 5.k : Clinical Outcomes elderly patient subject mechanical ventilation . 5.l : Clinical impact use sedatives analgesic drug mechanically ventilate patient . Design study This multicenter , international , observational non-interventional study collect data patient admit study ICUs meet inclusion/exclusion criterion May 1st , 2016 00:00 hour May 31st , 2016 23:59 hour . Patients already mechanically ventilate prior April 1 00:00 hour include study . Approval research ethic board participate institution seek protocol . Only investigator research coordinator site aware purpose precise timing study , order minimize practice modification response clinician ' knowledge observation . Main variable For main purpose study consider follow variable fill : • Date ICU admission , mode mechanical ventilation , date initiation mechanical ventilation , demographic date ( age , gender , reason start mechanical ventilation , severity score admission , weight , height ) , arterial blood gas begin mechanical ventilation , daily ventilator parameter ( apply positive end expiratory pressure [ PEEP ] , volume tidal , peak pressure , plateau pressure ) , mode NIV , duration NIV ( failure success ) , monitor NIV ( respiratory rate , sedation scale [ Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale , RASS ] , arterial blood gas NIV [ beginning , every 2 hour NIV tolerate , fail ] ) , date start withdrawal mechanical ventilation , method wean first attempt , mode spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) , reason failure SBT , date extubation , date reintubation , arterial blood gas time extubation , reason reintubation , development complication mechanical ventilation ( organ failure [ cardiovascular , hematological , hepatic renal failure ] , barotrauma , ARDS , sepsis , ventilator-associated pneumonia , ICUAW ) , tracheostomy need , date tracheostomy , type tracheostomy , date ICU discharge status ICU discharge , reason ICU mortality , status hospital discharge , length ICU hospital stay . 7 . Secondary variable We consider secondary parameter follow : • Mode mechanical ventilation , brand ventilator , biochemical parameter mechanical ventilation , use co-adjuvant therapy ( corticosteroid , insulin therapy ) , use medication ( neuromuscular blocker , sedative analgesic ) , type interface NIV , type respirator NIV , fluid balance , NIV home , previous tracheostomy , isolated ventilator monitor set mechanical ventilation ( invasive invasive ventilation ) , destination hospital discharge . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Randomization This prospective , observational , intervention study , therefore , randomization applicable . Sample size calculation Despite characteristic observational study ( international survey ) multiple objective evaluate , decide include patient accord calculation sample size main objective ( ICU mortality ) . In way , estimate 2,600 patient would need enrol study 90 % power detect rate survival ICU discharge 23 % versus 28 % previous study , overall two-sided alpha level 0.05 , assume 20 % miss patient . The secondary ob-jectives test use sample size . Statistical Methods Appropriate statistical analysis conduct . Data express mean ( standard deviation ) , median ( interquartile range ) proportion appropriate . Student 's Mann Whitney U test use compare continuous variable chi-squared test use categorical variable . Statistical analysis conduct use appropri-ate statistical software accord evaluate outcome . Quality Control Extensive effort make ensure quality data collect throughout study . At site , study physician , include review chart , review data randomly choose 5 percent screen patient patient screener question . Data random sample 7 percent case abstract entered database twice , error rate le 0.25 percent . The chart reevaluate final note , laboratory test result , oth-er result complete . Complete data necessary include patient final analysis , accept patient miss data main variable patient miss data less 10 % secondary variable . Ethical legal issue study . Patterns practice different hospital often idiosyncratic empiric base usual care mechanically ventilate patient . The study design provide high quality information ventilatory management critically ill patient large cohort subject short period time . It inform clinical practice much rapidly would possible standard randomize clinical trial . Given study design use anonymous survey base routine clinical parameter ventilatory set critically ill patient , main coordinator team guarantee ano-nymity patient include study . There possibility reporting adverse event due type study ( international , pro-spective non-interventional survey ) . Therefore , give low risk nature research ( nonintervention study ) , anonymity survey , `` unreasonable effort '' get write informed consent , use pro-cess `` opt-out consent '' involve provision information patient ( Information Form ) next kin opportunity opt-out use data wish . Confidentiality patient data Patients allocate unique study code . The site research coordinator enroll patient international database main coordinator study create enrollment number include country , unit unique study code . Study data obtain routinely collect quality assurance . The unique number identify data enter study database guarantee irreversibility clinical data . DATA MANAGEMENT Data collection method All data use study routinely collect clinical parameter obtain daily ICU admission . These data collect participate center lead local coordinator save online database . This database design Hospital Universitario de Getafe . Data monitoring Committee ( DMC ) A committee three main investigator ( Fernando Frutos Vivar , Óscar Penuelas , Alfonso Muriel ) ensure right safety patient involve study protect .
