	<brief_summary>Background : Lennox-Gastaut syndrome ( LGS ) severe childhood epileptic syndrome high pharmacoresistance . The treatment outcome still unsatisfied . The investigator previous study cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) child focal epilepsy show significant reduction epileptiform discharge . The investigator hypothesize cathodal tDCS apply primary motor cortex ( M1 ) combine pharmacologic treatment effective reducing seizure frequency participant LGS pharmacologic treatment alone . Material Method : Study participant randomize receive either : 1. pharmacologic treatment 5-consecutive day 2 milliampere ( mA ) cathodal tDCS M1 20 min 2. pharmacologic treatment plus sham tDCS . Measures seizure frequency epileptic discharge perform treatment immediately post-treatment 1- , 2- , 3- , 4-week follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participant recruitment inform consent Study participant recruit via advertisement pediatric outpatient department , Srinagarind Hospital , Faculty Medicine , Khon Kaen University , Thailand . The study procedure describe eligible participant express interest participate study pediatric neurologist . Criteria LGS define accord triad : 1. polymorphic intractable seizure mainly tonic , atonic , atypical absence seizure , 2. cognitive behavioral abnormality , 3 . EEG paroxysms fast activity slow ( less 2.5 Hz ) generalize spike-wave discharge ( GSWD ) . The diagnosis confirm pediatric neurologist use thoroughly history taking , physical examination , EEG , brain MRI . Study inclusion criterion include : 1. diagnosis LGS ; 2. failure two first-line antiepilepsy drug ( AEDs ) control seizures ; 3. average seizure frequency one per month 18 month three consecutive seizure-free month interval ; 4. age 6 15 year . The exclusion criterion 1. drug addiction , pregnancy , skull defect , serious neurological disease ; 2. change dosage antiepileptic drug use herbal remedy alternative therapy . All participant ' guardian give write informed consent . The study conform declaration Helsinki approve Ethics Committee Khon Kaen University ( Identifier number : Human Ethic ( HE ) 521232 . Experimental design The current study randomize double-blind control trial perform total 6 week consist : 1. 1-week period observation ass baseline seizure frequency , 2. 5 consecutive day 2 mA cathodal tDCS 30 minute , 3 . 4 week follow-up . Just treatment phase , study participant randomize 2:1 ratio block four randomization receive either ( ) pharmacologic treatment plus active tDCS stimulation ( b ) pharmacologic treatment plus sham tDCS stimulation 5 day . Participants ask continue routine anti-epileptic medication regimen throughout duration 6-week trial . Pharmacologic treatment Since considerable degree heterogeneity LGS , individualized approach necessary . The investigator firstly use antiepileptic drug currently approve Food Drug Administration available institute : lamotrigine , topiramate , clobazam , clonazepam depend seizure type . The investigator give lamotrigine 1-20 mg/kg/day slowly titration tonic , tonic-clonic , atypical absence , atonic seizure . Clobazam 0.25-3.5 mg/kg/day add case refractory lamotrigine participant myoclonic seizure . The investigator use clonazepam 0.04-0.2 mg/kg/day instead clobazam case clobazam available . We use topiramate 1-10 mg/kg/day participant refractory lamotrigine clobazam . In case , refractory aforementioned antiepileptic drug , investigator give zonisamide 1-20 mg/kg/day , levetiracetam 10-80 mg/kg/day , nitrazepam 0.1-0.8 mg/kg/day [ 8 ] . Randomization Blinding Prior treatment phase , study participant randomize 2 : 1 ratio block four randomization ( OT ) receive either ( 1 ) active tDCS stimulation ( 2 ) sham tDCS stimulation . Participants ask continue routine medication regimen throughout trial . The staff generate random allocation sequence , enrol participant , assign participant intervention involve assessment . After assignment intervention group , pediatric neurologist carry seizure assessment ( NA ) blind treatment condition . Because study participant also blind treatment condition , double-blind study . Active Sham Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation . tDCS apply via water-soaked pair surface sponge electrode ( 35 cm2 ) deliver battery-driven power supply . The constant current stimulator maximum output 10 mA ( Soterixmedical , Model 1224-B , New York , USA ) . The stimulation site leave M1 , locate base international electroencephalography ( EEG ) 10/20 electrode placement system . The reference electrode place right shoulder area . The tDCS device design allow sham stimulation place control switch front instrument easily cover opaque adhesive stimulation . Therefore participant gradient could know whether active sham stimulation . The power lit indicator also front machine time intervention active sham stimulation . However , sham stimulation , current discontinue 30 second power indicator remain [ 18 ] . Measures Number seizure Since Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome compose many seizure type . All seizure classify accord International League Against Epilepsy Revised Classification Seizures [ 29 ] . The participant monitor video-EEG order classify type frequency seizure , caregiver teach count classify seizures basis observation video recording . The caregiver also teach rule diary record prior baseline period . All caregiver blind treatment sham group . In case participant 1 caregiver . The investigator suggest refer daily diary person care participant time . Number seizure primary outcome variable , assess use daily diary . For baseline ( pre-treatment ) assessment , caregiver ask record number seizure every day 7 day baseline period daily diary . These 7 day number seizure average single rate per day baseline average seizure frequency . During 5 consecutive day treatment , caregiver ask record daily child seizure frequency . Finally , daily 24-hour recording administer four week follow treatment . 1- , 2- , 3- , 4-week composite number seizure compute average daily number seizure epoch ( i.e. , 1-week follow-up average number seizures = average 7 daily number seizure first week treatment ) . Epileptic discharge Epileptic discharge , secondary outcome variable study , record trained staff . EEG acquire participant use 32-channel , international 10-20 system electrode placement ( Neuvo , Compumedics , Australia PerFusion EEG software ) . EEG collect 30 minute awake state . EEG record single session baseline , immediately , 1- , 2- , 3- 4- week follow-up . EEG data analyze visual inspection . The number epileptic discharge 30-minute record assessed practice pediatric neurologist clinical neurophysiologist ( N.A . ) , blind treatment condition . The EEGs include abnormal EEGs LGS slow spike-wave complex &lt; 3 Hz occur wakefulness . The complex consist spike ( duration &lt; 70 msec ) sharp wave ( 70-200 msec ) , follow first positive deep trough , negative wave ( 350-400 msec ) . Paroxysmal fast rhythm ( 10-20 Hz ) occur mainly non-rapid eye movement sleep [ 30 ] . One slow spike-wave complex one episode paroxysmal fast rhythm count one epileptic discharge . Vital sign oxygen saturation monitor All participant closely observed physician post-treatment . Oxygen saturation vital sign monitor 30 minute , , 30 minute treatment . Pulse rate measure automatic sphygmomanometer ( Ua-767 Plus , UK ) supine position . Blood pressure ( mm Hg ) measure automatic sphygmomanometer ( Ua-767 Plus , UK ) supine position pediatric-size cuff wrap around right upper arm . Body temperature measure axillary electronic thermometer . Respiratory rate measure count chest rise 60 second . Pulse oximeter place left index finger monitor oxygen saturation throughout procedure . Adverse event Adverse event well sign symptom report participant ' guardian every day treatment . Theses self-recordings terminate 4 week stimulation . Statistical analysis The investigator first compute mean standard deviation ( SD ) demographic outcome variable descriptive purpose . Next , investigator compare two treatment condition ( active tDCS versus sham tDCS ) baseline outcome measure ensure baseline equivalence use t-tests . Results present mean SD . Both primary ( seizure frequency ) exploratory ( epileptic discharge ) hypothesis test use repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) follow Least Significant Difference help understand significant effect find . To describe clinically meaningfulness change , investigator compute percent reduction number seizures epileptic discharge condition pre- post-treatment pre-treatment 4-week follow-up . For analysis , p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Analyses complete use STATA software , version 10.0 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX ) .</detailed_description>
