	<brief_summary>Low back pain common , costly affect 80 % population lumbar discectomy frequent spinal procedure disc herniation . Pain &amp; mobility impairment persist patient follow microdiscectomy long term issue back pain . The question remain patient recover quickly without last difficulty patient persist prolonged disability follow surgery . The purpose study determine guide patient towards full function evaluate timing initiate strengthening , neurodynamics walk exercise program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Exercise Intervention Effects Following Lumbar Microdiscectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The direction treatment low back pain surgically conservatively seek improve function daily sport activity patient . The patient continue suffer significant level pain , disability reduce function follow single level microdiscectomy may benefit multi-factorial approach . A reduction neurodynamic mobility relate dural adhesion consider contribute factor persistent peripheral neuropathic pain . The clinical efficacy study address exercise protocol post surgery order provide optimal approach prevention scar tissue may contribute persistent pain post microdiscectomy . Mobility motor control impairment consider consequence onset pain . Education , neurodynamics stabilization exercise instrumental recovery post microdiscectomy reduction pain disability goal towards full functioning . The introduction neurodynamic protocol early exercise intervention may serve reduce pain inhibition result improved mobility motor control . The record step count per day follow lumbar microdiscectomy serve document daily physical activity level follow surgery . The purpose study determine whether significant difference pain level lumbar mobility early exercise intervention group versus late exercise intervention group post microdiscectomy .</detailed_description>
