	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study ass equivalence close triple therapy Fluticasone Furoate ( FF ) /Umeclidinium ( UMEC ) /Vilanterol ( VI ) open triple therapy ( FF/VI + UMEC ) , comparison triple therapy dual therapy ( FF/VI ) lung function . This phase III , 4-week , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , multicenter study compare FF/UMEC/VI ( 100 microgram [ mcg ] /62.5 mcg/25 mcg ) deliver via single ELLIPTA® inhaler ( 'closed ' triple ) + match placebo ELLIPTA inhaler , FF/VI + UMEC deliver via two ELLIPTA inhaler ( 'open ' triple ) FF/VI via single ELLIPTA inhaler + match placebo ELLIPTA inhaler , daily . The total duration subject participation approximately 7 week , consist 2-week run-in period , 4-week treatment period 1-week follow-up period .

	<criteria>A sign date write informed consent prior study participation . Outpatient Subjects 40 year age old Screening ( V1 ) . Male female subject . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define protocol Reproductive potential agree follow method specify protocol avoid pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) , 30 day prior first dose study treatment last dose study treatment completion followup visit . An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears Screening [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ) ] . Previous smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Screening ( V1 ) . A score &gt; =10 COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) Screening ( V1 ) . A postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/ force vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 = &lt; 70 percent predict normal value Screening ( V1 ) . Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Subjects current diagnosis asthma . ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible current diagnosis COPD , primary cause respiratory symptom ) . Subjects alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD . Subjects active tuberculosis exclude . Subjects respiratory disorder ( e.g . clinically significant : bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease ) exclude condition primary cause respiratory symptom . Subjects lung volume reduction surgery ( include procedure endobronchial valve ) within 12 month prior Screening ( V1 ) . Immune suppression ( e.g . advanced Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) high viral load low CD4 count , Lupus immunosuppressant would increase risk pneumonia ) risk factor pneumonia ( e.g . neurological disorder affect control upper airway , Parkinson 's Disease , Myasthenia Gravis ) .subjects potentially high risk pneumonia ( e.g . low BMI , severely malnourish , low FEV1 ) include discretion investigator . Pneumonia and/or moderate severe COPD exacerbation resolve least 14 day prior Screening ( V1 ) least 30 day follow last dose oral/systemic corticosteroid ( applicable ) . Other respiratory tract infection resolve least 7 day prior Screening ( V1 ) . Chest xray reveals evidence pneumonia clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD , another condition would hinder ability detect infiltrate chest xray ( e.g . significant cardiomegaly , pleural effusion scar ) . All subject chest xray Screening ( V1 ) [ historical radiograph CT scan obtain within 12 month prior Screening . Subjects experience pneumonia and/or moderate severe COPD exacerbation within 12 month Screening ( V1 ) must provide post pneumonia/exacerbation chest xray chest xray conduct Screening ( V1 ) ] . • For site Germany : If chest xray ( CT scan ) within 12 month prior Screening ( V1 ) available , approval conduct diagnostic chest xray need obtain Federal Office Radiation Protection ( BfS ) . Subjects historical current evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , gastrointestinal , urogenital , nervous system , musculoskeletal , skin , sensory , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) haematological abnormality uncontrolled . Significant define disease , opinion Investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 percent ) . Current active liver biliary disease ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . Subjects follow Screening ( V1 ) exclude : Myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month Unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month New York Heart Association Class IV Heart failure Abnormal clinically significant 12Lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding . An abnormal clinically significant finding would preclude subject enter trial define 12lead tracing interpret , limited , follow : Atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular rate &gt; 120 beat per minute ; Sustained non sustain ventricular tachycardia ; Second degree heart block Mobitz type II third degree heart block ( unless pacemaker defibrillator insert ) . A history allergy hypersensitivity corticosteroid , anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist , beta2agonist , lactose/milk protein magnesium stearate medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction , opinion investigator , contraindicate study participation . Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 3 year . Subjects carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude base 3 year wait period subject consider cured treatment . Use longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) describe rest oxygen therapy &gt; 3 liter ( L ) /min ( Oxygen use = &lt; 3 L/min flow exclusionary ) Subjects medically unable withhold albuterol/salbutamol 4hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year . Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Any infirmity , disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study . Study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator study site , immediate family member aforementioned involved study . In opinion investigator , subject unable read and/or would able complete study related material .
