	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize control trial 1:1 randomization 300 patient either use AliveCor device receive behavioral alter motivational text messaging OR continue usual care . The sample size power base test difference AF detection rate intervention group control group similarly design pilot study . In preliminary data 4 episode AF follow-up 12 patient detection rate 0.33 vs. detection rate 8 % among control . The detection window study time period randomization 6-month follow-up define . All patient ' clinical record review every month ( via chart and/or internal external electronic medical record system ) month 6 initiations/changes treatment target AF . A recurrence AF chart related therapy initiate result electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding usual cardiac care AliveCor™ Heart Monitor specifically look . Changes cardiovascular measure ( blood pressure , glucose control , etc . ) compare group . The effect participate intervention , include targeted text message AF knowledge cardiovascular behavior change determine compare change AF knowledge scale baseline 6 month . This study also measure compare incidence document AF group , change prescribe treatment healthcare provider 6-month period , relationship intervention change cardiac measure quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) measure baseline 6 month . A biannual time period choose capture AF redetection , change AF treatment , self-reported quality life base study show biannual time-points appropriate collecting propose study endpoint .</detailed_description>
