	<criteria>AJCC ( 2009 ) stage IV cutaneous melanoma stage III cutaneous acral melanoma judge inoperable . Patients history uveal mucosal melanoma eligible . Measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm CT scan . Patients must least one measurable lesion RECIST separate lesion amenable biopsy . Histologic proof melanoma review confirm MSKCC . Previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor document progression disease recent CT scan . Progression disease define 1 ) appearance new measureable lesion ( &gt; 10mm ) crosssectional image physical exam OR 2 ) enlargement previously detect lesion two consecutive image study OR 3 ) enlargement previously detect lesion correlative symptomatology one crosssectional imaging study . Patients remain eligible previous response PD1 inhibitor , include patient complete response , partial response stable disease . Primary progress patient define received antiPD1 therapy within 2 month study enrollment . Patients relapse disease define receive last dose PD1 block antibody ≥2 month prior enrollment . Patients receive adjuvant PD1 therapy develop measurable disease eligible . However , must receive last dose PD1/PDL1 blockade within two month enrollment trial . They stratify patient progressive disease . Life expectancy great 3 month . Age ≥ 18 year old . ECOG performance status = 0 1 Karnofsky Performance Status equivalent Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : WBC &gt; 2 , 000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X MSKCC upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X MSKCC upper limit normal patient concurrent liver metastasis , OR≤ 5 X MSKCC upper limit normal patient concurrent liver metastasis Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5x OR creatinine clearance least 40 Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test within 24 hour prior start study drug . A woman childbearing potential define female experience menarche undergone surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Menopause define clinically 12 month amenorrhea woman age 50 absence biologic physiologic cause . Women child bear potential men reproductive potential must willing practice acceptable method contraception . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Willingness undergo biopsy metastatic site site unresectable disease prior randomization History another malignancy except diseasefree 3 year , patient history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer and/or patient indolent secondary malignancy require active therapy , eligible . Consult study MSKCC Principal Investigator unsure whether second malignancy meet requirement specify . Any major surgical procedure external beam radiotherapy within 14 day prior study drug administration . Use investigational drug within 28 day prior study drug administration . Symptomatic untreated leptomeningeal brain metastasis spinal cord compression . Treated brain metastasis must stable least 1 month require treatment less 10mg/day prednisone equivalent least two week prior study drug administration Prior exposure either ipilimumab combine checkpoint blockade Any diagnosis autoimmune disease . Subjects Type I diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism require hormone replacement , adrenal insufficiency replacement dose steroid , skin disorder ( vitiligo , psoriasis alopecia ) require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Pregnant woman lactate woman History uveal mucosal melanoma Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection ( exception chronic clear HBV HCV infection , allow ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement steroid dose &gt; 10mg daily prednisone equivalent permit Patients history grade 4 toxicity previous anti PD1 treatment history grade 3 high pneumonitis . Patients history grade ≥2 neuropathy Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate Children age 18 Patients require hemodialysis Patients history allergy study drug component history severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody</criteria>
