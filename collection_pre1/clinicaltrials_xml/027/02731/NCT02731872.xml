	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish whether domiciliary use Airvo warm passover humidifier reduce number exacerbation patient respiratory insufficiency . Participants must diagnosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) . The following question investigate : Do outpatient receive long term oxygen therapy benefit deliver Airvo humidification system . The propose benefit investigation : 1. reduction number exacerbation thus hospital admission ? 2. increase quality life ( QOL ) ? 3. improved lung function thus increase physical activity ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Oxygen Therapy With Airvo High-flow Heated Humidification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experience Aalborg University Hospital 's Department Pulmonary Medicine ( Lungemedicinsk Afdeling ) Denmark give rise renew interest investigation property effect humidification COPD patient LTOT . For last 5 year , department discharge fibrosis patient oxygen flow &gt; 6 l/min warm mist humidifier . The initiative give clear indication infection ratio reduce QOL increase . Many COPD patient experience improve oxygen saturation oxygen treatment respiration insufficiency give warm humidification . Previous study typically concerned patient category involve use cold-water humidifiers . To increase air moisten , temperature must raise moisture absorption capability increase temperature . The 2009 study Rea et al . ( 9 ) examine effect warm humidification COPD bronchiectasis patient , use warm humidifier ( MR 880 ) average two hour per day . LTOT inclusion criterion study , severity COPD vary . Despite relatively short time use study demonstrate beneficial effect humidification exacerbation frequency . Our study therefore aim examine effect use warm humidification minimum night - preferably 8 hour . In addition usual oxygen apparatus , treatment group Airvo warm humidifier installed home . Their respiratory gas flow set increase 20-25 l/min base patient preference ; peripheral saturation reading form basis adjusting oxygen flow rate . The control group continue receive standard oxygen therapy prescribe department . For study achieve desire power , 190-200 patient across two group require Appendix 3 ) . Patients must diagnose severe/very severe COPD receive long-term domiciliary oxygen treatment ( LTOT ) For participant , follow procedure adhere : 1 . Metrics inclusion : - Demographic data - Pulmonary function measurement use spirometry - Exacerbations ( number ) - hospitalisation day past year ( data extract AS400 ) - antibiotic course prednisolone course past year ( prescription database ) - exacerbations/self-treatment plan launch - 6-minute walk test - QOL measurement ( St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ) - Artery puncture ( Airvo group ) 2 . Metrics project period 1 , 3 , 6 9 month : Patients contact telephone date agree advance . - QOL measurement ( St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ) . Form complete 6 month ; send patient advance . - Number exacerbations/self-treatment plan launch 3 . Metrics project period completion ( 12 month ) : Patients call outpatient visit department - Pulmonary function measurement ( spirometry ) - St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( sent patient prior interview ) - 6-minute walk test - Exacerbations project period ( number ) - hospitalisation day past year ( data extract AS400 ) - antibiotic course prednisolone course past year ( prescription database ) - exacerbations/self-treatment plan launch Analysis statistical processing project data perform statistician Hans Hockey Biometricmatters Ltd , Hamilton , New Zealand . Power calculation base anonymised data extract AS400 already perform . Consultation Mr Hockey clarify `` event '' `` visit '' synonymous term . In appendix term `` event '' use , indicate number contact hospital . According Mr Hockey , risk time calculate `` period time patient risk event consider '' . Risk time thus corresponds time patient participate trial . The trial period 12 month , drop-out due death withdrawal reason expect . All data include study , include data dropout . This project protocol approve North Denmark Region scientific ethical committee ( N-20110057 ) .</detailed_description>
