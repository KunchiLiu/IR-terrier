	<detailed_description>A sample 140 subject recruit remedial physical training population Corps Cadets . This achieve regular communication company level Tactical Officers ( TAC ) Physical Development Officers ( PDO ) . Upon consent , unit integrity maintain team Cadets randomize either Army standard PRT group KB group . Once group assign , PDO 's provided training calendar upcoming eight week period kettlebell safety/familiarization session arrange unit KB group . Prior start training , subject undergo pre-assessment follow performance measure : broad jump , vertical jump , 40 yard sprint 60 yard shuttle . Current APFT score collect West Point Academy Management System ( AMS ) . After assessment , assign PRT group conduct training accordance Army Field Manual 7-22 ( sustainment phase activity ) . The KB group conduct training exception kettlebell exercise place strength train circuit ( occurs alternate day ) . KB exercise initially instruct principal investigator ( certify kettlebell instructor CrossfitÂ® ) , independence exercise note , principal investigator 's role become supervisory continued KB exercise execute leadership unit PDO 's . Upon conclusion eight week training program , subject undergo post-assessment consist measure note previously . Follow APFT score collect either West Point AMS grade test TACs/PDOs diagnostic test . Once data collection complete , analysis perform use SPSS version 19 . A 2x2 mixed-model analysis variance perform application Sidak 's multiple comparison test determine statistical significance reach .</detailed_description>
