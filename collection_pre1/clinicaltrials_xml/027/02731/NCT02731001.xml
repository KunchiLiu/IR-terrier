	<brief_summary>The aim study reduce acute radiation induce side effect , i.e . pneumonitis esophagitis grade II high use proton therapy compare photon radiotherapy equal total dose . Secondary endpoint include evaluation quality life , loco-regional control , survival late radiation induce side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Therapy Reduce Acute Normal Tissue Toxicity Locally Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients trial undergo primary radiochemotherapy locally advance NSCLC . As early intermediate late effect radiotherapy hamper quality life , case radiation induce pneumonitis , potentially lethal , reduction side effect desirable . Patients trial 1:1 randomised intensity modulate radiotherapy photon proton therapy . The primary aim study show decrease pneumonitis esophagitis grade 2 high proton therapy . The observed incidence side effect 39 % photon therapy . The estimated incidence proton therapy around 12 % . Simultaneous chemotherapy apply current clinical standard .</detailed_description>
