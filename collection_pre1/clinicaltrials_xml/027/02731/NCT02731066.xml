	<brief_summary>This research evaluate nutrition requirement mission high altitude ( i.e . &gt; 7800 foot sea level ) information obtain use optimize nutrient content specification combat ration . The objective : 1 . Determine whether loss lean body mass result negative calorie balance 22-d period high altitude prevent increase dietary protein intake . 2 . Determine efficacy carbohydrate ( glucose fructose ) supplementation aerobic exercise performance sea level , acute exposure high altitude , response 22-d period negative calorie balance high altitude . 3 . Determine cognitive function , sleep pattern , behavioral response high altitude underfeeding . 4 . Determine appetite eat behavior response high altitude sustain underfeeding . 5 . Examine effect high altitude , negative calorie balance , dietary intake manipulation gut health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty-four , normal overweight ( body mass index 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 ) , physically active adult civilian active duty military personnel recruit 44-d protocol , 22-d sea level 22-d high altitude ( HA ) . During 22-d sea level phase , volunteer receive dietary counseling maintain baseline weight consume protein level consistent recommendation period low physical activity ( 1.0 g/kg/d ) . During 22-d HA , meal beverage ( water ad libitum ) prepare provided volunteer research staff . Physical activity increase HA calorie intake reduce 40 % create state negative calorie balance . Changes total body , lean body , fat mass assess sea level 22-d energy deficit HA . Regulation muscle mass assess use stable isotope methodology , muscle biopsy , various molecular technique , directly measure muscle protein synthesis , whole body protein balance , cellular mechanism regulate process . Furthermore , exercise testing , substrate oxidation rate , expire carbon dioxide label stable isotope carbon dioxide ( one extra neutron ) use assess total , exogenous , endogenous carbohydrate oxidation performance capacity . A comprehensive cognitive/behavioral test battery perform sea level HA . Sleep assess actigraphy . Eating behavior appetite assess sea level , acute HA , 22-d energy deficit HA use validated measure . Gut health assess use sugar absorption test bacterial composition gut characterize use advanced molecular technique .</detailed_description>
