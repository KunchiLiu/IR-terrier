	<brief_title>Point Care Ultrasound Evaluation Suspected Appendicitis Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Increasing concern raise past several year regard degree radiation exposure patient evaluate abdominal complaint . A deepen body literature support use ultrasound evaluation appendicitis . In particular , ultrasound promote first line test evaluation appendicitis pediatric population adult BMI &lt; 25 . This approach reduce risk related radiation exposure IV contrast dye . Unfortunately , many practice setting , availability radiology-based sonographers limit significant delay obtain ultrasound image . For reason , many ED physician ( EP ) begin perform bedside ultrasound evaluate appendicitis . Studies demonstrate wide range accuracy ultrasound appendicitis . Sensitivities specificities vary standardize diagnostic criterion exist . Additionally , little publish directly study EP point care ultrasound evaluation acute appendicitis . One study show EP-performed ultrasound relatively low sensitivity , high specificity . However , study perform wide range user vary skill level older ultrasound machine . The surgical literature suggest ability clinician integrate history , physical exam ultrasound finding real time improve diagnostic accuracy ultrasound appendicitis . Currently 4 physician staff ED fellowship train point care emergency ultrasound , fully credentialed already perform ED base evaluation appendicitis limited basis . The current standard care point care ultrasound first-line imaging patient suspect appendicitis credentialed EP available perform scan . We intend evaluate performance EP-performed point care ultrasound diagnosis acute appendicitis ED patient . This study would primarily investigate accuracy ultrasound compare criterion standard either abdominal CT result surgical pathology report . STUDY DESIGN : This prospective , descriptive study Emergency Department patient suspect acute appendicitis . Initial screen potential enrollee perform ED nurse , resident , attending . Once consent enrol , study sonographer interview examine patient , preferably lab result available . The ultrasound must complete adequate image obtain image modality complete . Ultrasound right low quadrant ( RLQ ) perform use graded compression technique describe previously literature . All participate EP sonographers already train technique , fully credentialed additional training perform . A `` Bedside '' standardize data collection form use bedside record ultrasound find clinical information . The sonographer designate appendix `` visualized '' , `` visualize normal '' , `` visualize abnormal '' ultrasound `` positive appendicitis '' , `` negative appendicitis '' `` indeterminate '' base exam ultrasound finding . A second sonographer , blind clinical information primary sonographer 's ultrasound interpretation , review de-identified ultrasound image remotely . This overreading sonographer record interpretation secondary finding `` Blinded Reviewer '' standardize data collection sheet . CT imaging , surgical pathology report , two week telephone follow utilized determine final outcome patient 's clinical course . At time , third `` Follow Up '' standardize data collection sheet use record patient outcomes demographic information . Based expected proportion patient prove appendicitis 15 % desire precision 0.15 , estimate sample size study 261 . STUDY POPULATION AND RECRUITMENT METHODS : Study population include patient age present emergency department abdominal pain clinical suspicion appendicitis . Patients initially see treat attend physician resident . If concern appendicitis treat physician contact one ultrasound credentialed EP sonographers perform point care ultrasound . Of note , current standard practice ED . By choose participate study , patient 's treatment alter way current standard practice , simply agree allow u collect data contact phone two week follow . The study sonographer obtain consent . Parental consent obtain patient age 18 . DATA TO BE UTILIZED : The follow data record : - Patients initial - Patient Medical Record Number ( MRN ) /Financial Identification Number ( FIN ) - Age - Sex - Height - Weight - Symptom Duration - Chief complaint - Presence RLQ pain - Anorexia - Migration pain RLQ - Rebound tenderness - Nausea/vomiting - Maximum recorded temperature Emergency Department - White Blood Cell ( WBC ) count - Visualization iliac vessel ? - Visualization appendix ? - Maximum out diameter appendix - Thickness appendix wall - Edema wall appendix ? - Peri-appendiceal edema free fluid ? - Non compressible appendix ? - Pain compression appendix ? - Evidence dilate bowel loop RLQ ? - Increased vascularity appendix wall ? - Appendicolith ? - Free fluid right upper quadrant ( RUQ ) ? - Diagnostic impression sonographer - Diagnostic impression blind reviewer - CT diagnosis - Pathology diagnosis - Operative report classification - Time disposition - Final diagnosis - Symptoms/Subsequent diagnosis two week DATA ANALYSIS : For primary outcome , data use calculate sensitivity specificity point care ( POC ) US diagnosis appendicitis compare criterion standard CT , operative report , discharge diagnosis two week follow phone call . For secondary outcome , likelihood ratio specific ultrasound finding determine . Inter-rater agreement bedside sonographer blind reviewer calculate use Cohen 's kappa coefficient . Continuous , time-to-disposition data compare utilizing two-tailed t-test . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS software ( IBM , Armonk , NY ) . RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT : There minimal risk patient participate study since ultrasound non-invasive know safe . There slight risk participant ' privacy confidentiality breach . Standard precaution take ensure privacy confidentiality maintain study . BENEFITS : Patients ultrasounds highly suspicious appendicitis may refer directly surgery without image perform . In instance study patient would benefit reduced radiation exposure faster referral appropriate surgical care . The result study may use improve future patient care . COMPENSATION / INCENTIVES AND RESEARCH-RELATED COSTS : No compensation give participant . There research-related cost . ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES : Patients refuse participate study quality treatment affect way . RESEARCH MATERIALS , METHODS AND CONFIDENTIALITY : Research record store locked office , file cabinet , computer use password . SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT : We seek document informed consent HIPAA Authorization . ED patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion ask would like participate study research sonographer time ultrasound . If patient agrees participate , informed consent document give review . If patient decline participate continue treatment course Emergency Department . REFERENCES : Burford JM , Dassinger MS , Smith SD . Surgeon-performed ultrasound diagnostic tool appendicitis .
