	<brief_title>Prevalence Onychodystrophy Patients With Chronic Venous Disease Lower Limbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The final goal work determine patient increase clinical severity chronic venous insufficiency also high prevalence onychodystrophy . Chronic Venous Insufficiency ( CVI ) vascular disease respond number different clinical syndrome manifest low extremity , whose nexus venous hypertension ( HTV ) . Onychodystrophy foot progressive non-infectious condition associate various factor , increase age . Predominantly occur female , present poor aesthetic appearance often annoy footwear . The work intend perform observational , descriptive , analytical , cross-sectional unicentric . In order prove feasibility , researcher conduct previous pilot study . The study undertake preliminary investigation work ( pilot study ) perform total 40 patient ( age 40 85 ) attend service Angiology Vascular Surgery Hospital de Sant Pau . These patient select verify data researcher perform statistical study descriptive inferential point view .</detailed_description>

Patients agree voluntarily participate study sign inform consent document . Congenital Onychopathy Presence nail plate fungal , viral bacterial infection Emergence digital foot deformity Manifestation biomechanical problem Presence degenerative joint disease ( arthrosis , arthritis ) Patients make make routine use inappropriate poorly adjust footwear especially , onychodystrophy attributable clearly , directly footwear Individuals present Greek foot especially , manifest onychodystrophy second toe . Patients onychodystrophy due surgical iatrogenic event Individuals present subungual tumour ( exostosis , tumor Glomus , chondroma , whitlow melanic ) . Patients take take drug directly associate cause onychodystrophy Patients history skin diseases psoriasis , Lichen Planus alopecia areata , associate general nail manifestation . Patients background physical chemical trauma nail foot clearly give rise onychodystrophy . Individuals , type amputation low limb . Patients history nail foot surgery ( less year ) show digital amputation ( total partial ) . Individuals , despite comply requirement study , decline participate refuse sign inform consent document .
