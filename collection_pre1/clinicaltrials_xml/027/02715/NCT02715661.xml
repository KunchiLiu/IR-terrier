	<detailed_description>This randomize control trial , randomization nest within rationally-formed group . Three major group assess : 1 ) Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient , 2 ) Metabolic Syndrome ( MetS ) , 3 ) healthy Control ( CTL ) participant . Allocation Healthy CTL versus MeTS group confirm pre-study screening visit base medical questionnaire , blood sample outcome , ultrasound imaging ( see ) . All CTL MeTS participant allocate random assignment six-month exercise training group , 6-month `` wait-list '' train group follow 6-month exercise training period . The exercise training accordance American College Sports Medicine Canadian Society Exercise Physiology guideline support 3 days/week laboratory target heart rate-based aerobic activity ( ~30 minutes/day ) two day at-home activity . Based target heart rate , level exercise intensity and/or duration adjust every two week sustain train stimulus . CAD patient define diagnosis coronary artery disease hospitalize cardiac event . Within recruit CAD participant , Group 1 ( CADcr ) volunteer receive structure cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program . Group 2 ( CADuc ) receive recommendation cardiac rehabilitation choose participate ( due various reason include distance cardiac rehabilitation site ) , yet volunteer testing procedure baseline follow six month period . While random assignment prefer , feasible CAD patient , experience , geographical constraint personal barrier restrict access CR CR often consider normal standard care ( wo n't volunteer avoid CR want CR ) . Instead , naturalistic control approach use whereby patient participate CR may still participate undergoing test follow six month period time . Use recall survey establish activity pattern non-exercise train group wait period . Both group receive in-hospital education , referral CR program , personal prescription ( referral ) , encouragement follow-up . All subject complete series test follow six-month interval exercise time control . Exercise train majority test occur Laboratory Brain Heart Health ( Labatt Health Sciences Building , Rm 402 ) . Protocols : Cardio-respiratory Fitness : Fitness determine use self-paced six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) administer per American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) guideline whereby physician 's presence require . Blood Sample : After rest quietly 30 min , fast ( &gt; 3 hour ) venous blood sample take antecubital vein analysis blood glucose , lipid , insulin ( LifeLabs ) , marker astrocyte vascular damage ( D. Fraser ) , endothelial function ( e.g . endothelin , P-selectin ) inflammation ( e.g . hsCRP , TNFa , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 ) , neural function marker ( e.g . epinephrine , norepinephrine ) , proliferative factor ( e.g . NFK-B , brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , VEGF ) ( K. Summers ) . Additional sample 10 mL whole blood take Robarts Research Institute analysis genetic marker vascular risk ( e.g . Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) BDNF polymorphism ( R. Hegele ) ) monocyte inflammatory profile use flow-cytometry ( G. Dekaban ) . Up 5 sample plasma ( ~1 mL ) send Victoria Hospital cell culture fluid-flow analysis polymorphonuclear cell binding ( G. Cepinskas ) . The total volume blood sample exceed 60 mL . Vascular Ultrasound : Ultrasound use measure artery diameter blood flow Carotid Artery , Carotid Sinus , Brachial Artery Femoral Artery . Dilation brachial artery also measure follow five minute forearm ischemia ( flow-mediated dilation ) four minute follow sublingual single dose ( 0.4 mg ) sodium nitroglycerine ( standard over-the-counter self-treatment angina ) . Sympathetic Nerve Activity : Peripheral sympathetic nerve activity obtain peroneal nerve use microneurography . A 200 µm-diameter , 35 mm long tungsten microelectrode taper uninsulated 1- 5-µm tip insert transcutaneously peroneal nerve posterior fibular head . A reference electrode position subcutaneously 1-3 cm record site . A sympathetic nerve site confirm characteristic pulse-synchronous burst pattern produce skin paraesthesia increase frequency voluntary apnea and/or Valsalva manoeuvre arousal loud noise . Transcranial Ultrasound : A small probe hold temporal window ( behind eye ) headband measure flow velocity within middle and/or posterior cerebral artery . Cerebrovascular Reactivity ( Hypercapnia ) : Subjects breathe hypercapnic gas mixture 5 % CO2/21 % O2/Balance N2 2-way non-rebreathing valve . This gas inspire 5 minute two repeated trial separate least 5 minute recovery . Sit-to-stand test : To test dynamic rate recovery cerebral blood flow transient change blood pressure , brain blood flow transcranial Doppler ultrasound , blood pressure , heart rate , end tidal CO2 ( mask ) measure ~3 min seat rest , two minute stand , period seat rest . This protocol may repeat three time . A gas analyzer face mask mechanism enable measurement expire oxygen carbon dioxide hypercapnia sit-to-stand test . Electrocardiogram : A standard electrocardiogram collect via small surface electrode chest determine heart rate . Ventilation Patterns : A respitrace strain gauge place around chest record breathing pattern . Blood pressure measure use small cuff place finger ( Finometer ) , confirm upper arm sphygmomanometry . Hemoglobin saturation measure pulse oximeter one digit . 1 . 6-min walk test : Using self-paced format , participant walk back forth along long hallway six minute distance cover record . Participants may rest need throughout test . 2 . Leg arm muscle strength ( isometric ) . Participants push single arm leg resistance machine force measure . Three maximal-effort 3-sec repetition repeat separated minute two rest . Neuropsychology Tests : These test study key functional outcome vascular cognitive impairment include measure related mood , memory cognition . The test pen-and-paper , administer trained personnel , , base publish standard ( Hachinski et al. , 2006 ) include follow : Overall Cognitive Function : Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MOCA ) , Trail make test , The Stroop Word-Colour Test . The latter task take advantage ability read word quickly automatically name color . Executive Function ( Animal Naming , Controlled Oral Word ) , Association ( Trail Making Test ) ; Language ( Boston Naming Test 2nd Edition , short form ) ; Visuospatial ( Rey-Osterrieth Complex , Figure Copy , Complex Figure Memory ) ; Digit Span Digit Symbol cod Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV ( WAIS-III ; Canadian norm ) Memory ( Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ; http : //www.wpspublish.com/store/Search ?

( Reference : V. Hachinski et al . National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke - Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards , Stroke , 2006 , 37:2220-2241 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) : Two separate MRI protocol perform participant . These complete either 3 Tesla 7 Tesla image system Robarts . The series image acquire include : 1 ) T1 MPRAGE anatomical , 2 ) FLAIR white matter hyperintensities , 3 ) MR angiography vascular architecture , 4 ) black-blood angiography middle cerebral artery baseline five minute hypercapnia . Sample Schedule Testing : These perform pre post training period . Visit 1 - Laboratory Testing 1 ( 3 hour ) Consent : 15 min Supine rest : 30 min Blood sample : 10 min ( use partly group allocation pre test ) Snack : 10 min Instrumentation ( include transcranial Doppler carotid artery vascular ultrasound image ) : 60 min Cerebrovascular Reactivity hypercapnia sit-to-stand task : 45 min Visit 2 - Laboratory Testing 2 ( 2h ) Cognitive test : 45 min Vascular imaging : 30 min Six-min walk : 10 min Leg Muscle Strength : 10 min Visit 3 - MRI Testing ( &lt; 1.5 hour total time ) Baseline blood pressure : 10 min MRI Preparation : 10 min Anatomical : 10 min White Matter Hyperintensities : 10 min Angiography : 20 min MR angiography middle cerebral artery hypercapnia : 20 min The Interventions : Rehabilitative Exercise : The cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program provide initial exercise intervention refer CAD patient ( Dr. Suskin ) . The CR program use standardize , prescriptive progressive exercise ( primarily aerobic exercise ) practice improve functional capacity patient follow clinical cardiac intervention . The CR program London last 6 month . In general , aerobic exercise training intensity 40 % -70 % heart rate reserve , rate perceive exercise score 11-14 ( 6-20 Borg scale ) , 3-7 d/wk , 20-60 min/session ( multiple 10-min session ) .</detailed_description>
