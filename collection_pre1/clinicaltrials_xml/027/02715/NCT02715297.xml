	<brief_summary>This multi-center randomized control phase II trial investigate impact stereotactic fractionate radiotherapy resection cavity complete resect recurrent glioblastoma progression free survival . As secondary endpoint , overall survival , safety toxicity well early response criterion MRI , quality life neurocognitive function assess .

	<brief_title>Adjuvant Stereotactic Fractionated Radiotherapy Resection Cavity Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment recurrent glioblastoma , beside abundance clinical practice , still discussion . Patients present recurrent disease therefore treat within individual concept , largely base small prospective trial , retrospective evaluation case report . Therefore , treatment range best supportive care primary systemic treatment towards local therapy radiotherapy surgical resection . Even might large selection bias , local therapy without concomitant adjuvant chemotherapy seem promise large prognostic benefit . Whether combination surgical resection adjuvant radiotherapy improve survival , within primary situation , unknown . The result surgical resection might impact well . Several case report , retrospective evaluation prospective study also include patient remain gross tumor maximum save resection . In trial , radiotherapy associate improvement progression free well overall survival . Therefore , influence neuroimaging prognosis currently evaluate within GLIA-A trial . Furthermore , stereotactic radiotherapy without experimental systemic therapy currently investigate within another multicenter randomize trial ( NOA-12 ) . Whether patient might benefit postoperative radiotherapy resection cavity complete extirpation macroscopic tumor key question protocol . To answer question , consider standard care complete resection , namely observation without adjuvant systemic therapy , compare postoperative normofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy towards resection cavity within open label , randomize trial . The prescribed total dose 46 Gy 2 Gy fraction 36 Gy 3 Gy fraction depend treatment volume . Concerning safety , side effect monitor prospectively . Safety parameter compare arm study . Furthermore , measure quality life , neurocognitive function well neuroimaging feature evaluate prospectively .</detailed_description>
