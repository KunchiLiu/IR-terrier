	<detailed_description>Purpose Background Schizophrenia serious mental health disorder constellation positive , negative , cognitive symptom . Negative symptom include characteristic affective flattening , avolition , alogia . Positive symptom include delusion , hallucination , disorganize speech behavior . Auditory hallucination ( AH ) hallmark schizophrenia . They report many 50-75 % patient diagnosis . The hallucination experience patient vary greatly severely impact individual 's ability function daily basis . In approximately 25-30 % patient diagnose schizophrenia , medication ineffective mechanism manage symptom . These hallucination know medication refractory auditory hallucination ( MRAH ) . They define `` persistence daily hallucination without remission despite antipsychotic medication adequate dosage least three month '' . For whose AH respond medication , non-surgical brain stimulation ( NBS ) recently show promise therapeutic intervention . Specifically , use conductive electrical approach term transcranial electrical stimulation ( tES ) . One method tES receive renew interest due high portability , safety , modulatory effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . tDCS involve apply weak electrical current use saline soak electrode sponge , cause either increase decrease cortical excitability , respectively . Research show healthy subject patient ( e.g . Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , stroke , depression ) tDCS potential modulate synaptic neurotransmitter-dependent plasticity underlie change behavior learn . Brunelin et al utilized tDCS successfully reduce MRAH population diagnose schizophrenia . They able reduce AH approximately 30 % sample 5 day twice-daily treatment effect maintain approximately three month follow treatment . This finding yet replicate similar study . Along tDCS , new method NBS investigate across various disease state . One study look impact tES tinnitus . They test whether type tES make difference efficacy . They compare tDCS tRNS . tRNS similar tDCS except superimposes random `` white noise '' gaussian waveform ( 0.1 hz 640 hz ) top DC current . They find tRNS induced large suppressive effect tinnitus loudness tinnitus-related distress compare tDCS . While finding tinnitus , multiple scholarly work describe relationship tinnitus AH , possibly continuum dimension underlie variety normal disease state . This relationship suggest strategy find efficacious tinnitus may fact also efficacious AH . Recently , case series show possible efficacy AH use tRNS . The purpose study examine efficacy tES treatment MRAH schizophrenia . The hypothesis tRNS provide large reduction AH schizophrenia compare tDCS treatment ( i.e . sham ) . Confirmation hypothesis would provide excite new option treatment may provide even high level efficacy see tDCS . Further , study would also provide replication work Brunelin et al . support tES compel tool management severe MRAH . Specific Aims 1 . Determine efficacy tES treatment MRAH . Hypothesis 1a : tDCS effective sham treatment MRAH show reduction total subscores AHRS . Hypothesis 1b : tRNS effective sham tDCS treatment MRAH show reduction total subscores AHRS . 2 . Demonstrate safety tolerability tES treatment MRAH . Hypothesis 2a : tDCS safe well tolerate treatment MRAH demonstrate TSEQ . Hypothesis 2a : tRNS safe well tolerate treatment MRAH demonstrate TSEQ . 3 . Exploratory : Detect tES sensitive subtypes AH base MUPS . Study Design This study double-blind , group , sham-controlled . Subjects randomize one three arm ( tRNS , tDCS , sham ) remain arm duration study . All subject complete enrollment visit , ten treatment visit ( 2 visit per day ) , 1 , 3 , 6 month follow-up visit . Given durability effect suggest literature le 6 month , patient follow beyond 6 month . The outcome study measure standard auditory hallucination rating scale include Positive Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS ) , Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale ( AHRS ) , psychotic symptom rating scale ( PSYRATS ) . Both AHRS PSYRATS include outcome measure ensure generalizability exist study tES ( use AHRS ) along broad body AH research ( use PSYRATS ) . The primary efficacy parameter PSYRATS show evidence accurate representation AH . Clinical Significance - This study replicate expand previous research regard use tES treatment medication refractory auditory hallucination - Based finding , study could potential application non-invasive clinical intervention treat MRAH affect 25 % medicated patient schizophrenia . Subjects This study recruit individual receive outpatient service Minneapolis VA Medical Center , University Minnesota Department Psychiatry , University Minnesota Medical Center -- Fairview . Patients refer clinical staff multiple department include Mental Health , Polytrauma , Social Work . Referral base clinical diagnosis Schizophrenia Schizoaffective disorder medication refractory auditory hallucination assess patient 's clinical provider . Subjects also ability self-identify flyer local newspaper ad . Brunelin et al find large significant effect size ( d=1.58 , p &lt; 0.001 ) investigator use guide power analysis . The investigator power analysis perform three arm use alpha 0.025 , power 0.8 , desire effect size 1.00 . This analysis result need approximately 20 subject per arm . Pre-screening . In order reduce subject burden , investigator obtain waiver HIPAA authorization inform consent recruitment screen allow potential subject pre-screened chart review person telephone prior schedule potential participant initial visit . Potential participant provide information study ask series question determine meet basic inclusion/exclusion criterion , history MRAH . They tell basic aim study , interested participate schedule initial visit time complete consent paperwork . Initiation Visit The initiation visit ( visit 1 ) start completion informed consent , HIPAA , Modified Dysken Tool ass capacity consent . The participant must score 7 / 10 Dysken Tool order participate study . Should participant score less 7 , s/he offer remedial teach re-assessment . Should subject agree via consent demonstrate capacity consent , s/he enrol study . A full baseline evaluation perform . This include assessment via MINI , MUPS , PANSS , AHRS , PSYRATS Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . Treatment Visits Visits 2 - 10 exclusively treatment visit . At visit participant complete tES Side Effect Questionnaire ( TSEQ ) pre post treatment . Visits occur twice daily 5 day . Visits must space least 2 hour apart . Depending arm participant randomize , s/he receive treatment either tDCS , tRNS , sham . Treatment provide use Starstim Neurostimulator ( Neuroelectrics , Inc. ) This device approve use research United States without investigational device exemption due meeting criterion non-significant risk . The energetic parameter use tDCS tRNS ( 2mA 20 min ) well electrode ( SPONSTIM-25 25cm2 electrode ) . Both tDCS tRNS initiate ramp-like fashion 10 0mA 2mA . Once 2mA , tDCS hold constant entire session whereas tRNS consist alternate current 2mA 0mA offset apply random frequency range 0.1 100 Hz . The sham procedure involve 40 sec stimulation 2mA drop 0mA 15msec pulse every 550msec . Should participant able tolerate current 2mA due pain irritation , current decrease minimum 1.5mA . If 1.5 mA still tolerable , participant remove study . Electrode placement base international 10-20 electrode placement system . The anode place midpoint F3 FP1 , location correspond approximately left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , cathode place midpoint T3 P3 , location correspond leave temporo-parietal junction . Placement parameter tDCS consistent Brunelin et al , 2012 ) . Placement parameter tRNS consistent . Stimulation setup administration take approximately 30 minute . Visit 11 run visit 2 - 10 completion final ( 10th ) stimulation session , subject complete PANSS , AHRS , PSYRATS . This visit typically take 90 minute . Follow-Up Visits Visits 12 - 14 follow-up assessment visit occur 1 month , 3 month , 6 month post treatment . Participants receive stimulation instead assess via PANSS , AHRS , PSYRATS . Missed Visits In event participant miss session treatment , session re-scheduled treatment continue soon possible . The deviation treatment note study record .
