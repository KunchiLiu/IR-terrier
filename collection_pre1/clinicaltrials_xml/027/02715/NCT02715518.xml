	<brief_title>FFR Versus Angiography-Guided Strategy Management AMI With Multivessel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presence ischemia prerequisite improvement clinical outcome percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . It well-known discrepancy exist angiographic stenosis severity presence myocardial ischemia . This discrepancy completely overcome even precise invasive imaging modality intravascular ultrasound optical coherence tomography . Currently , fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) regard gold-standard invasive method define lesion-specific ischemia FFR-guided PCI proven reduce unnecessary revascularization enhance patient 's clinical outcome . Therefore , current guideline recommend FFR measurement intermediate coronary stenosis definite evidence lesion-specific ischemia . However , previous evidence well demonstrated benefit FFR-guided strategy mostly generate non-acute myocardial infarction patients.1 , 3-5 Recently FAMOUS-NAMI trial evaluate 176 patient acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) multivessel disease , demonstrate feasibility FFR measurement acute NSTEMI patient also present FFR-guided decision make non-infarct related artery ( IRA ) stenosis significantly reduce unnecessary stent implantation without difference major adverse cardiovascular event 1-year well medical cost , compare angiography-only guided decision make process . Nevertheless , evidence clinical set acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . Since 30-50 % patient AMI possess multivessel disease , ability accurately assess functional significance non-IRA stenosis time initial primary PCI would potentially facilitate revascularization decision potential health economic benefit . Moreover , avoid unnecessary stent implantation non-IRA stenosis patient AMI multivessel disease would reduce possibility stent- procedure relate complication , enhance long-term prognosis patient . Therefore , FRAME-AMI trial compare 2-year clinical outcome index primary PCI FFR-guided strategy versus angiography only-guided strategy management non-IRA stenosis AMI multivessel disease patient .</detailed_description>
