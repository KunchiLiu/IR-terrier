	<brief_summary>The effect phototherapy widely study research group . The investigator know positive result light application improve muscle performance delay fatigue . However , study show itsÂ´ effect muscular training . Therefore , aim study assess effect phototherapy apply different time 12 week strength training . For , 48 volunteer , healthy male , 18 35 year old recruit perform strength train protocol anterior muscle thigh development . Volunteers perform train protocol three time week 12 week . There assessed isometric peak torque isokinetic dynamometer , concentric peak torque , 1-repetition maximum test leg extension leg press machine bilateral thigh perimetry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phototherapy Applied Association With Muscular Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical , randomize , control placebo double-blind study . Forty-eight participant perform muscular training protocol . Subjects practice protocol train 60 % load follow 80 % load , measure 1-repetition maximum test , session train protocol . The training protocol consist perform 3 set 7 repetition 60 % 1-RM , 4 set 7 repetition 80 % 1-RM . This protocol perform every session , three time week , employ leg press leg extension machine . Phototherapy , active placebo , apply 6 different point anterior muscle thigh training session . Only one investigator , participate phase assessment trainings session , know program active placebo phototherapy device . Randomisation carry simple draw lot ( A , B , C , D ) first visit . The phototherapy unit emit sound regardless program use , active placebo . Either strength training last 12 week assessment perform baseline , 4 , 8 12 week . There evaluate maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC ) , concentric torque , bilateral thigh perimetry 1-repetition maximum test ( 1-RM ) .</detailed_description>
