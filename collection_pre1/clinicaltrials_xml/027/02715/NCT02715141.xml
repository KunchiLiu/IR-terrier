	<brief_summary>Rationale : Since January 2014 Dutch screen programme bowel cancer implement . Screening increase demand surveillance . Although patient adenomas remove increase risk progress cancer , solid evidence reduction death CRC current colonoscopy-based surveillance lacking . Furthermore , colonoscopy-based surveillance lead high logistic demand , high individual burden high cost . Therefore , need new surveillance strategy . Stool-based molecular testing ( Cologuard速 , consist stool DNA test immunochemical assay human hemoglobin ) Faecal Immunochemical Testing ( FIT ) may serve alternative colonoscopy surveillance . The aim study compare accuracy establish molecular stool test ( Cologuard速 ) FIT colonoscopy detection advance adenomas CRC ( advanced neoplasia ) surveillance population . These outcome use model various strategy stool-based molecular surveillance inform health policy decision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Since January 2014 Dutch screen programme colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) implement . Screening increase demand surveillance . However , solid evidence reduction death CRC current colonoscopy-based surveillance lacking . Furthermore , colonoscopy-based surveillance lead high logistic demand , high patient burden high cost . Therefore , need new surveillance strategy . Stool-based molecular testing ( Cologuard速 ) Faecal Immunochemical Testing ( FIT ) may serve alternative colonoscopy surveillance . OBJECTIVES : 1 . To compare accuracy establish molecular stool test ( Cologuard速 ) FIT colonoscopy detection advance adenomas CRC ( advanced neoplasia ) surveillance population . 2 . To model various strategy stool-based molecular surveillance inform health policy decision . MATERIALS AND METHODS : In prospective observational cross-sectional cohort study , individual age 50-75 year schedule surveillance colonoscopy invite participate . They ask collect whole-stool sample prior surveillance colonoscopy . The sample use test presence molecular stool marker . The result molecular stool test FIT compare colonoscopy finding . EXPECTED RESULTS : Frequent surveillance use stool-based molecular test cost-effective current colonoscopy-based surveillance .</detailed_description>
