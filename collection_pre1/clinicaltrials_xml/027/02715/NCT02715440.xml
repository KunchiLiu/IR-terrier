	<brief_title>Stopping Benzodiazepines Related Molecules Among Elderly Living Residential Institutions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : In France , 30 % people 65 consume benzodiazepine relate drug ( B &amp; M ) long term basis . These drug responsible side effect like cognitive impairment , fall fracture installation addiction , long-term efficacy poorly document . Recent best practice guideline develop French Health Authority ( HAS ) focus stop benzodiazepine relate drug elderly . Residents geriatric institution particularly risk fall cognitive impairment , possible stop drug facilitate condition . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate feasibility safety stop benzodiazepine relate drug institutionalize elderly . Studying one year later maintain cessation benzodiazepine relate drug METHODS : DESIGN : Intervention Study randomize control open 2 parallel arm . Participating center : 20 geriatric institution ( nurse home ) Randomization : Residents include paired geographical criterion ( live unit ) . Residents pair randomize use randomization list : group Immediate group delay intervention . Interventions : Immediate : Within 15 day randomization , medical investigator meet attend general practitioner : - remind good practice B &amp; M drug prescription - provide advice stop drug target concrete protocol individualize stop 6 week - propose supervision resident . Delayed intervention : The resident continue usual care without intervention general practitioner . Eight week randomization , letter send general practitioner remind recommendation prescription proposing , desire , protocols stop benzodiazepine relate drug resident include . OUTCOME MEASURES : The measure carry simultaneously resident give pair , schedule resident group Immediate : - NPI-SCALE week precede cessation benzodiazepine relate drug ( W2 ) correspond week 50 % reduction initial dose ( W6 ) During week follow full stop ( W10 ) . - Sleep duration number awakening evaluate sleep diary wrist actimetry , obtain week . - Reports symptom withdrawal symptom week . - Reports adverse event throughout study . To describe included Residents : - The current disease autonomy Gerontology Groups Iso-Resources group ( AGGIR ) measure group notice - The resident evaluate cognitive test Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) . - If general practitioner refuse stop benzodiazepine relate drug anonymous questionnaire reason present . 1. year follow-up do study use benzodiazepine relate drug ( long-term occasional ) , The introduction psychotropic drug , occurrence fall fracture notice . The autonomy Gerontology Groups Iso-Resources group ( AGGIR measure ) note MMSE realize . Duration study : The study duration resident 10 week randomization . They participate one day year follow-up . Residents come study follow case : - withdrawal patient representative consent , - investigator 's decision leave patient study patient 's interest , prolongation withdrawal 2 week compare initial term due onset withdrawal symptom , - patient 's death Main Outcome Measures : Feasibility : - percentage resident expose benzodiazepine relate drug eligible refuse participate trial - included proportion patient whose general practitioner refuse stop benzodiazepine relate drug Tolerance : - negative impact sleep : sleep disturbance severity assess score NPI-scale sleep item - negative impact behavior : severity agitation aberrant motor behavior assess score item agitation / aggression aberrant behavior scale . Secondary outcome measure : - Average length sleep - Average number nightime awakening per week assess use sleep diary wrist actimetry . - Severity behavioral problem assess score item NPI-scale . - Proportion patient adverse event ( include withdrawal symptom ) . - Proportion patient discharge study . - Proportion patient immediate intervention benzodiazepine relate drug stop 10th week stop one year . Statistical analysis : The feasibility analyze descriptive statistic . The impact sleep behavior investigate test non-inferiority base Student 's distribution . The comparison proportion two group ( adverse event , withdrawal , fall fracture ) perform use chi-square test . EXPECTED RESULTS : This study ass , real condition , medical practice , feasibility stop benzodiazepine relate drug elderly living geriatric institution . The objective verify end benzodiazepine relate drug negative effect sleep behavior induce withdrawal syndrome . Remote monitor show whether withdrawal maintain time , carryover psychotropic drug , The expected benefit stop benzodiazepine relate drug notice . If expect result obtain , protocol withdrawal benzodiazepine relate drug widely propose geriatric institution .</detailed_description>
