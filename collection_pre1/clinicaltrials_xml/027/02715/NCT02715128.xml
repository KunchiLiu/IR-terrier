	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) common , recurrent , frequent chronic disorder . Among others , deficient cognitive control emotional distraction central characteristic MDD ( Ochsner &amp; Gross 2005 ; Disner et al . 2011 ; Beck 2008 ) . Hypoactivation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) link deficit ( Dolcos &amp; McCarthy 2006 ) . Moreover , aberrant functional connectivity pattern find MDD patient ( Kaiser et al . 2015 ) . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive brain stimulation method largely investigated experimental neuroscience tDCS prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) propose novel treatment MDD . So far , prefrontal tDCS show enhance cognitive control emotional distraction MDD patient ( Wokenstein &amp; Plewnia 2013 ) . Also , tDCS-induced connectivity change find fMRI study compare resting-state network configuration prefrontal tDCS may reflect state enhanced alertness ( Keeser , Meindl , et al. , 2011 ; Park et al. , 2013 ) . The aim study investigate neurophysiological correlate tDCS effect MDD patient . For purpose , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data collect execution cognitive control task well resting-state condition follow real sham tDCS . It hypothesize prefrontal tDCS compare sham ) reduce distractibility compensate deficient DLPFC activity b ) enhance functional connectivity network associate externally direct attention cognitive engagement . In placebo-controlled study patient diagnosis MDD receive single treatment prefrontal tDCS ( anode electrode position F3 , cathode F4 , 20 min , 2mA intensity ) sham tDCS ( frequency duration correspondent active tDCS , ramp ramp period without intermittent stimulation ) . Before , , treatment resting-state measurement fMRI scanner conduct . Subsequently , participant perform cognitive control task ( dependence Plewnia , C. , Schroeder , P. A. , &amp; Wolkenstein , L. ( 2015 ) ) scanner . The patient assign either real sham tDCS condition accord randomise , double-blind parallel design .</brief_summary>
