	<brief_summary>Frailty associate bad outcome acute coronary syndrome , best management frail patient acute coronary syndrome remain unknown . The aim investigate benefit intervention frailty frail patient acute myocardial infarction . Patients survivor acute myocardial infarction ( without ST-segment elevation ) , old 70 year pre-frailty ( 1-2 point ) frailty ( â‰¥3 point ) accord Fried 's scale measure 24 hour hospital discharge , include . The participant randomize 2 strategy : ) intervention frailty addition usual care cardiologist , b ) conventional strategy consist usual care cardiologist . A multidisciplinary team ( physician , nurse physiotherapist nutritionist ) carry intervention frailty The study contemplate 2-year inclusion period 3rd year follow-up last included patient . The main outcome frailty status ( Fried 's scale ) 3 month 1 year . The secondary endpoint clinical event , cardiovascular cardiovascular event , include recurrent event ( cumulative event analysis ) , total follow ( 3 year case first include patient ) . The hypothesis intervention frailty improve frailty status clinical outcome frail patient acute myocardial infarction .</brief_summary>
