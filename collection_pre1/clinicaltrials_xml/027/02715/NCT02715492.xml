	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) major health problem worldwide , case inoperable late presentation underlie cirrhosis . It represent fifth common tumor world third frequent cause mortality amongst patient cancer . Due worldwide difficulty find liver transplantation , hepatic resection ( HR ) represent main stay curative treatment patient HCC . Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) widely use alternative treatment unresectable HCC patient eligible operate . TACE also could adjuvant therapy resectable HCC patient hepatectomy , could prevent recurrence improve long-term survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thromboembolism well-recognised complication malignant disease . Clinical manifestation vary venous thromboembolism disseminate intravascular coagulation arterial embolism . Disseminated intravascular coagulation commonly observe patient haematological malignant disorder wide spread metastatic cancer , whereas arterial embolism commonly observe patient undergoing chemotherapy non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis . The goal use antithrombotic therapy TACE HCC minimize mortality improve survival rate without provoke excessive bleeding .</detailed_description>
