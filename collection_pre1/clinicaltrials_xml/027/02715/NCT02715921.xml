	<brief_summary>Fitness patient Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) important biomarker associate high survivability improve quality life . CF patient encourage maintain active lifestyle , however , physician able prescribe airway clearance measure specific medication , prescription exercise avenue promote exercise outside clinic hospital . The advent ubiquitous compute transformed landscape healthcare delivery . Thus far , exercise train CF either require patient travel gym rely home visit telephone call . Virtual visit provide novel innovative platform deliver live stream exercise session two-way video audio capability , allow individualized attention exercise CF patient comfort privacy home . Applications tele-exercise , tele-rehabilitation , show effective conventional physical therapy follow orthopedic surgery , stroke patient , optimize patient outcome prolong duration treatment prevent observed decline termination therapy . For CF patient , latter especially important give impact hospitalization acute exacerbation exercise tolerance . In particular population , cross-contamination risk limit use group exercise activity , use two-way video telecommunication allow participation exercise program adhere standard CF management regard infection control . This study would first evaluate implement tele-exercise remote monitoring program pediatric CF patient . Our pediatric CF patient enrol six-week exercise program stream live instructor computer home via HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform . Remote monitoring device , accelerometer wireless heart rate monitor , evaluate baseline habitual activity intensity exercise , respectively . The goal study show tele-exercise program feasible convenient cost-effective method enhance CF care patient .</brief_summary>
