	<detailed_description>Asthma important chronic disease significant public health problem . Prevalence asthma rise region world , affect age commonly among children.The burden suffering cause chronic respiratory disease identify World Health Organization ( WHO ) priority . In Malaysia , asthma among common medical condition treat health clinic give rise considerable morbidity mortality ( Bahari , Mohd Nur &amp; Rahman , 2003 ) .Much morbidity asthma believe due factor denial chronic condition ( GINA , 2002 ) , poor knowledge disease process medication use ( Gibson et al. , 2004 ) , poor understanding use inhaler ( Thapar , 1994 ) poor self-management ( Wilson et al. , 1993 ; Hilton , Sibbald , Anderson &amp; Freeling , 1986 ) . Patient education become essential area service provision , increase population people chronic disease condition require long-term management community . Inadequate patient education cite potential cause re-attendance optimal format education uncertain . Numerous study worldwide evaluate impact patient education indicate component amenable asthma education ( GINA , 2002 ) . Thus , patient education become key component asthma management asthma patient age group ( Lai , et al. , 2002 ; Harrison , 1998 ) . Despite mean control asthma effectively , many asthma sufferer Malaysia avail strategy , lead avoidable problem range frequent asthma attack even death certain circumstance . Much morbidity asthma believe due factor denial chronic condition ( Gibson , et al. , 2004 ) , poor knowledge disease process medication use ( Thapar , 1994 ) , poor understanding use inhaler ( Wilson , et al. , 1993 ) poor self-management ( Lai , et al. , 2002 ; Hilton , Sibbald , Anderson &amp; Freeling , 1986 ) . However effectiveness patient education asthma hospital-based setting Malaysia previously evaluate remains puzzle researcher . With concern researcher would like explore effectiveness Asthma Education Programme improvement patient ' knowledge regard asthma , medication adherence inhaler technique . Research question . Does Asthma Education Programme result improvement patient 's knowledge regard asthma disease inhaler technique ? Research aim . . To compare patient knowledge regard asthma disease intervention control group . ii . To compare patient inhaler technique intervention control group . iii . To assess association patient 's demographic data health outcome ( Knowledge inhaler technique ) . Study design . This experimental study clinical trial . The period study six month start July 2015 January 2016 . Study Setting This study conduct Ampang Hospital government public tertiary specialist hospital Ampang , Selangor Malaysia . Population ( N ) . Asthmatic patient treat Ampang Hospital study period . Target Population . Asthmatic patient present Asthma Bay , Respiratory Clinic admit general medical ward uncontrolled acute asthma attack . Sample Size ( n ) . The sample size study calculate use formula hypothesis test difference proportion researcher determine effect size 15 % significant change , study need least 129 subject arm . Inclusion Criteria . - Patient age 18 year . - Have confirm diagnosis bronchial asthma medical record . - Have use inhaler medication past 1 year . Exclusion Criteria . - Patient significant medical comorbidity heart disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic renal disease , stroke , psychiatric problem inability follow instruction . Sampling method . Patients present Asthma Bay , Respiratory Clinic admit general medical ward fulfil inclusion criterion recruit subject study . Patients ' give explanation study write consent obtain agree participate study . Patients randomize use simple computer randomization . Instrument . The data study collect utilizing three adapt instrument previous study permission use questionnaire obtain email . Questionnaire ( Part A ) : Demographic data Part A consist information subject demographic data , age , sex , race , education level , history childhood asthma number ward admission ED visit past one year . In post test questionnaire part omit subsequent layout similar . Questionnaire ( Part B ) : Asthmatic patient ' knowledge disease . Part B consist twenty close ended question , assess respondent ' basic knowledge disease , medication treatment maintenance . The questionnaire adapt previous study Baez Saldana , et.al ( 2007 ) . Responses make selection three choice answer `` '' , `` b '' `` c '' . Questionnaire ( Part C ) : Multiple checklist inhaler technique . To evaluate respondent ' inhaler technique single page multiple checklist create Vicky Kritikos adapt . The checklist contain six type inhaler technique medication , Metered Dose Inhaler ( MDI ) spacer , MDI , Turbuhaler , Accuhaler , Intranasal device Handihaler . Subjects ask investigator demonstrate use inhaler medication individually . Incorrect step inhaler technique highlight emphasis AEP . Validity Reliability . The validity reliability instrument content checked expertise panel respiratory physician pilot study hold test-retest Cronbach alpha test . Data Collection . There three phase involve data collection study . Following Ethic Committee approval researcher meet Head Department Emergency Department , Medical respiratory physician charge Respiratory Clinic notify study formal letter explain purpose study copy ethical approval give . Phase 1 : Recruitment randomization . Patients fullfill subject inclusion criterion unit approach subject give briefly explanation study write consent obtain . Subjects ( single blind study ) randomize use simple computer randomization . Subjects intervention group give appointment date attend Asthma Education Programme subject control group routinely go normal follow . Phase 2 : Baseline data collection AED session intervention group . Baseline data collection subject control group hold ward Respiratory Clinic subject recruit Asthma Bay baseline data collect routine follow Respiratory Clinic . Upon completion collection baseline data subject give appointment date 4 week day clinic visit second session data collection . For intervention group baseline data collection hold prior Asthma Education Programme appointment date give 4 week second data collection.The Asthma Education Programme consist four item . 1 . Education video Asthmatic patient adapt Info Sehat Bahagian Pendidikan Kesihatan Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia explain Asthma disease , medication patient responsibility Asthma management . 2 . Small group discussion subject 's help understand good Asthma management . 3 . Face face demonstration teach inhaler technique . 4 . Pamphlet give subject prepared Bahagian Pendidikan Kesihatan Kementerian Malaysia contain vital information Asthma disease management . Phase 3 : Second data collection , After four week collection baseline data , group subject attend follow-up Respiratory Clinic appointment give researcher required answer questionnaire demonstrate inhaler technique . Data Analysis The collect data review researcher cross-check two independent individual . The data enter Statistical Package Social Science ( SPSS ) version 20 analyse use descriptive inferential statistical . Questionnaire Part A analyse use frequency mean statistical , result display tables.To analyse association subject ' demographic data knowledge status inhaler technique Chi-square test independent t-test use . Part B questionnaire contain 20 item ask regard respondent ' knowledge disease , medication treatment maintenance . `` . Responses make three choice answer . Each correct answer give score 1 , 0 score wrong answer . Researchers determine status respondent ' knowledge two category , total score 15 20 , category good knowledge total score one 14 poor knowledge category . In order obtain result descriptive statistic ( mean ( SD ) analysis perform . For result comparison statistic ( mean ( SD ) analysis perform . For result comparison intervention control group Independent t- test analysis use . Part C questionnaire evaluate respondent ' inhaler technique use single page multiple type inhaler technique checklist Metered Dose Inhaler ( MDI ) , MDI spacer , Turbuhaler , Accuhaler , Intranasal device Handihaler . Ethical Considerations The study register approve National Medical Research Register , Malaysia .</detailed_description>
