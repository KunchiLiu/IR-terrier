	<detailed_description>Ovarian follicular responsiveness control ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) gonadotropins extremely variable patient even cycle cycle patient . Achieving ideal follicular response critical success assist reproduction treatment ( ART ) . Since early year ART , patient classify 'poor ' , 'normal ' 'high ' responder . Although term widely use research daily clinical practice , precise definition fully agree upon . Distinguishing base various measure ovarian reserve . The first description poor responder occur 1983 , first international consensus criterion poor responder ( Bologna Criteria ) publish 2011 . Poor responder , general , exhibit inadequate response hormonal stimulation diminish reproductive outcome . In contrast poor responder , high responder characterize exaggerated ovarian responsiveness , accompany high risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) . In IVF clinic , `` normal responder '' comprise majority patient . These patient characterize adequate response gonadotropin stimulation , relatively low risk OHSS , low cancellation rate . However , even relatively good prognosis , still important develop treatment high efficacy , low multiple birth rate , low complication rate . In addition , ovum donor unique population patient special characteristic challenge . Egg donation proven effective treatment option treatment various form infertility . However , ovum donor young population significant OHSS risk . Moreover , study regard population provide ideal opportunity determine effect various trigger regimen implantation ( endometrial effect ) attributable oocyte cohort alone ( follicular effect ) . In era evidence-based medicine special emphasis reduce IVF risk ( mainly OHSS pregnancy multiple , important find optimal safe ovulation induction trigger regimen patient population . The use GnRH agonist ( GnRHa ) trigger among high responder order reduce eliminate OHSS example important breakthrough clinical management IVF patient . Although GnRHa trigger show effective human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) induce oocyte maturation 20 year ago , use trigger ovulation possible introduction GnRH antagonists pituitary suppression . In contrast hCG trigger , GnRHa trigger characterize simultaneous LH FSH surge , similar natural ovulation . Early result GnRHa trigger disappointing , report several RCT‟s , high pregnancy loss rate lower ongoing pregnancy rate observe . Subsequently , outcomes dramatically improve adoption adjust regimen enhance luteal support . A pivotal study Engmann et al ( 2008 ) include high responder patient first IVF cycle patient history high response previous cycle . The author report case OHSS patient underwent GnRHa trigger together intensify estrogen progesterone supplementation , maintain comparable reproductive outcome receive HCG trigger . Moreover , increase safety GnRHa trigger report among ovum donor several report . Another well design RCT , recruit patient OHSS risk factor ( PCOS well oligo/amenorrhea ) differentiate trigger day `` low '' vs. `` high '' OHSS risk accord actual ovarian response . These researcher emphasize fact pre-stimulation classification high responder optimally correlate actual response hormonal stimulation . Therefore , need distinguish ) pre-stimulation assessment base clinical , laboratory ultrasonographic parameter ( previous OHSS , anti-müllerian hormone ( AMH ) antral follicle count ( AFC ) , respectively ) b ) actual response evaluate number size recruit follicle serum estradiol concentration . Another prominent trend ART recent year introduction dual triggering , involve combination GnRHa plus hCG triggering . This regimen create simultaneous LH FSH surge GnRHa , resemble physiologic ovulation triggering , together sustain LH-like activity hCG , stimulate corpus luteum excrete sufficient hormonal endometrial support . Since introduction , dual trigger gain popularity due outstanding result retrospective study among normal high responder . Griffin et al , 2012 report among high responder , dual-trigger group ( GnRHa plus 1,000 IU hCG ) significantly higher live birth rate ( 52.9 % vs. 30.9 % ) , implantation rate ( 41.9 % vs. 22.1 % ) , clinical pregnancy rate ( 58.8 % vs. 36.8 % ) compare GnRHa alone , without high risk OHSS . A large retrospective study , include 376 normal responder patient 378 complete cycle , result significantly high implantation ( 29.6 % vs. 18.4 % ) , clinical pregnancy ( 50.7 % vs. 40.1 % ) , live-birth ( 41.3 % vs. 30.4 % ) rate hCG ( 6,500 IU ) together GnRH agonist , compare hCG alone . Additionally , dual trigger find efficient method improve final oocyte maturation among patient high immature oocyte rate patient low number oocytes retrieve per number pre-ovulatory follicle . To best knowledge , report effect dual trigger IVF outcome among poor responder OHSS occurrence ovum donor . Moreover , spite encouraging retrospective report , prospective RCTs dual triggering report date . The aim current propose study compare efficacy dual trigger conventional triggering among three IVF population ( high , normal poor responder ) , well ovum donor . The current proposal include three different protocol , implement four population separate simultaneous RCT 's : 1 . Dual trigger 1000 unit hCG vs. GnRH agonist alone high responder IVF patient ovum donor . 2 . Dual trigger vs. 5000 unit hCG normal responder 3 . Dual trigger vs. 10000 unit hCG poor responder</detailed_description>
