Research Design : Throughout development iterative usability testing , project consultant , expert field adolescent substance abuse treatment prevention , review interact Arise , result use modify finalize user interface navigation maximize usability prior pilot test adolescent . Once revision addition complete integrated fully function product , investigator conduct RCT pilot clinical study 125 adolescent age 15 - 17 year substance abuse recovery evaluate benefit effectiveness Arise . The investigator use roll enrollment stagger entry design adolescent randomly assign one two condition : ( ) Group A , participant receive access Arise throughout entire 12-week trial period , ( b ) Group B , participant receive treatment usual ( TAU ) 6-weeks , follow access Arise start midpoint 12-week trial period . Over trial , follow outcome area assess : substance use craving , substance abuse recovery relapse knowledge , perceive benefit substance use , cop behavior cop , stage change , treatment usual description . The investigator also assess usability acceptability Arise gather information adverse events/serious adverse event occur interaction program . Hypotheses : Based Phase I find 3C 's experience develop similar product , investigator expect high user rating Arise product , anticipate improvement outcome across area synchronize date access Arise , provide evidence promise new educational program generate beneficial substance use abstinence outcome . The investigator expect participation program associate negative outcome . The investigator expect Phase II finding demonstrate great sobriety maintenance adolescent access Arise compare typical aftercare activity . Length Study : The investigator anticipate pilot phase study , include recruitment , conduct pilot RCT , collect 6-month follow-up data last 17 month . Confidentiality : Due sensitive nature study , investigator obtain Certificate Confidentiality NIDA . The Certificate number CC-DA-16-061 , valid 9/17/2014 - 9/17/2018 .</detailed_description>
