	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 General Introduction Ocular surface disease , especially dry eye scleritis , commonly affect patient autoimmune disease . Ocular surface immune cell increase autoimmune disease ; however full subset immune cell activate unknown . Recent experimental study show dendritic cell T cell cornea critically associate corneal nerve innervation . Corneal confocal microscopy ( CCM ) allow rapid non-invasive vivo image dendritic cell corneal nerve . The investigator propose investigate ocular surface health , conjunctival immune cell corneal nerve/dendritic cell morphology interact 3 rheumatological condition : Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) , Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . The preliminary flow cytometric study show various immune cell ( eg : T cell , B cell , dendritic cell ) quantify use minimally invasive impression membrane ( Eyeprim ) . Clinically , research team experience measure feature ocular surface inflammation ( conjunctival redness , tear breakup time ) Oculus keratograph5M . The investigator also aim harvest conjunctival immune cell use impression cytology quantify specific cell type flow cytometry . Corneal nerve morphology dendritic cell density distribution assess use CCM ; collaboration group pioneer technique . Investigators anticipate alteration corneal nerve dendritic cell parameter correlate immune activation/inflammation , deterioration tear function increase systemic severity rheumatological disease . In addition , investigator hypothesize low corneal nerve density , high number corneal dendritic cell conjunctival inflammatory cell . Studying relationship may allow good mechanistic understanding local corneal systemic immune activation development non-invasive ophthalmic surrogate marker dendritic cell activation nerve fibre loss aid earlier diagnosis , risk stratification development new therapy autoimmune patient severe dry eye . 1.2 Rational Study Purpose Dry eye , type chronic ocular surface inflammation , highly prevalent contributes corneal blindness imposes severe health burden . Scleritis ocular surface inflammatory disorder associate mild severe inflammation sclera without intraocular inflammation . Severe dry eye scleritis associate autoimmune disease like SS , RA , SLE , condition . Current treatment dry eye often effective enough ( eg. , cyclosporine ) cause adverse effect ( eg. , corticosteroid-induced glaucoma ) . In autoimmune dry eye , immune-mediated damage ocular surface lacrimal gland . In various model dry eye disease , show component immune system T cell , macrophage cytokine interleukin ( IL ) 1β tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α critical trigger maintain disease . Likewise treatment non-infective sclerits challenge situation uveitis specialist . Ocular surface immune cell increase autoimmune disease present , either proportion number particular type immune cell , eg . monocyte CD4+ T cell may increase presence severe local inflammation and/or systemic activity . A signature immune cell infiltration may present particular rheumatological condition . If certain type cell , ( e.g. , T cell B cell ) predominant systemic disease , suggest T cell approach ( e.g. , tacrolimus ) B cell approach ( e.g. , rituxamab ) may use . Alternatively , certain cytokine play major role dry eye , inhibitor cytokine signal JAK inhibitor may use . Recent study show dendritic cell T cell cornea critically associate corneal nerve innervation [ 1 , 2 ] . This show human animal study [ 1-4 ] . At time , technology vivo image human corneal nerve dendritic cell quantification greatly improve recently . This led explosion interest harness technology surrogate marker peripheral neuropathy explore underlying mechanism [ 5-27 ] . The investigator previously show first generation CCM quantify presence density Langerhans cell ( LCs ) Bowman 's layer cornea patient diabetes [ 28 ] . However late 3rd generation HRT III use classify quantify Langerhans cell ( LCs ) mature phenotype ( dendritic cell bearing long process ) immature phenotype ( non-dendritic cell lack cell dendrite ) provide insight immune alteration vivo [ 29 ] . A recent experimental study diabetic mouse use CCM show direct contact DCs corneal nerve may trigger nerve fiber damage [ 30 ] . Gap scientific knowledge : Researchers show proinflammatory cytokine elevate tear human dry eye ; many may secrete immune cell . They find preliminary flow cytometric study CD4+ T cell , CD19+ B cell , CD14+ monocytes , CD1c dendritic cell quantify use minimally invasive impression membrane ( Eyeprim ) [ 31 ] . The full subset immune cell activate ocular surface dry eye , various rheumatological condition , know . The proportion cell different severity dry eye different systemic activity autoimmune disease evaluate . Furthermore , uncertain whether integrity cornea innervation also determinant tear function patient autoimmune systemic disease . The research group undertake many clinical trial image study human ocular surface . This include measurement Oculus ( non-invasive tear breakup time ) , stain , etc. , measurement cytokine use multiplex bead base sandwich immunofluorescence assay [ 32-38 ] Preliminary Studies The research group also optimize Eyeprim collection conjunctival immune cell method analysis use panel immune marker Amnis [ 31 ] , relatively new type flow cytometry ( Figure 1 ) couple microscopy ( Figure 2 ) . The advantage Amnis technique direct visualization analyze cell permit co-localisation signal . They publish validity cell morphological parameter analysis use Amnis software , compare human grader [ 31 ] . In addition , also use conventional flow cytometry ( BD FACS ) quantify CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CCR7 , CXCR3 , CD109 CD63 staining ( data show ) . In collaboration ENA team , team train image acquisition use CCM enable quantification corneal nerve dendritic cell [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 27 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Sub-basal corneal nerve fibre density , corneal nerve branch density , corneal nerve fibre length tortuosity ( Figure 3 , 4 ) quantify use manual ( CCMetrics ) automate ( ACCMetrics ) image analysis software , develop ENA team . Sub-basal mature immature dendritic cell density distribution relation corneal nerve quantify . The collaborator , Prof Malik Dr. Petropoulos lead Early neuropathy assessment ( ENA team-http : //qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/faculty/eng/index.html ) pioneer use vivo CCM rapid , non-invasive ophthalmic instrument monitor diabetic peripheral neuropathy . They actively engage train oversee optimal image capture provide necessary software license privilege enable detailed quantification interpretation [ 9 , 10 , 12-14 , 16 , 17 , 20 , 21 , 23-27 ] . 2 . HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES Overall long term objective : Discover safe effective treatment ocular surface inflammation define ocular surface indication clinical usage medication target immune system rheumatological disease .
