	<criteria>Patient histologically cytologically proven advanced ( unresectable ) metastatic solid tumor disease progression treatment available therapy know confer clinical benefit intolerant treatment meet follow requirement part study participate : 1 . Part 1 : Any advanced metastatic solid tumor patient 2 . Part 2 : For select tumor type archival tumor tissue available formalinfixed paraffinembedded new biopsy must perform obtain tissue sample prior study treatment initiation . Female patient , childbearing potential , must negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior date first dose study medication . Female patient childbearing potential male patient must agree use 2 adequate method contraception partner start screen visit 150 day last dose study therapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 Part 1 ≤ 1 Part 2 . Adequate organ function . Patient receive prior therapy antiprogrammed death receptor 1 ( antiPD1 ) , antiPD1ligand1 ( antiPDL1 ) , antiPD1 ligand2 ( antiPDL2 ) agent . Known uncontrolled central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Note : Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least 4 week prior first dose study treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , clinically stable steroid least 7 day prior study treatment . Carcinomatous meningitis precludes patient study participation regardless clinical stability . Known additional malignancy progress require active treatment within last 2 year . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell cancer ( SqCC ) skin undergone potentially curative therapy , situ cervical cancer . Poor medical risk . Pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive child within project duration study . Immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose study treatment . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Known active hepatitis B ( eg , hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg ] reactive ) hepatitis C ( eg , hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV RNA ) ( qualitative ) detect ) . Active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( ie , use diseasemodifying agent , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . History interstitial lung disease . Patient recover ( ie , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) radiation chemotherapyinduced adverse event ( AEs ) receive transfusion blood product ( include platelet red blood cell ) administration colonystimulating factor ( include granulocytecolony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) , granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor ( GMCSF ) recombinant erythropoietin ) within 3 week prior first dose study drug . Currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week prior first dose study drug . Received prior anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , targeted therapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy ) within 21 day , less 5 time halflife recent therapy prior study Day 1 , whichever short . Note : palliative radiation therapy small field ≥ 1 week prior Day 1 study treatment may allow . Patient recover adequately ( ≤ Grade 1 ) AEs and/or complication major surgery prior start therapy . Patient receive vaccine within 7 day plan start study therapy . Known hypersensitivity TSR042 components excipients .</criteria>
