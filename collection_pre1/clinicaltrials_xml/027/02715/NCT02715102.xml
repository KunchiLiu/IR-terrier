	<brief_title>Circulating Tumor DNA Patients High Risk Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific somatic ( i.e . acquire inherited ) mutation find many cancer . Some cancer shed DNA patient 's blood stream call circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) . Pathway Genomics develop new molecular assay use blood plasma source DNA fragment . The ctDNA isolate , amplify analyze presence one 96 know mutation find 9 cancer driver gene . This technique use `` liquid biopsy '' screen monitor cancer document number recent medical publication . However , majority publish study subject already diagnose cancer . Therefore , investigator wish look population patient schedule undergo diagnostic therapeutic bronchoscopy thoracotomy without know history cancer ( basal cell carcinomas skin ) . The blood drawn time week procedure . The analysis blood sample take place Pathway Genomics clinical laboratory Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 1988 ( CLIA ) certify . Following informed consent process , patient fill health questionnaire blood drawn prior surgical procedure . Up 30 ml blood ( approximately 2 tablespoon ) draw one time . The patient ask agree contact investigator yearly 5 year provide follow-up medical information . No patient identify presentation publication result work data report analysis combine information participant study . Individuals may participate study 18 year age old , prior diagnosis cancer ( skin cancer undergo thoracic surgical procedure cancer diagnose within prior month ) , undergo diagnostic therapeutic bronchoscopy thoracotomy .</detailed_description>
