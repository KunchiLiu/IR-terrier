	<detailed_description>Research question Is difference mortality prediction performance two ICISS approach trauma patient admit hospital urban India ? Study design The investigator conduct retrospective registry base study . Setting The data use prospective cohort study name towards improve trauma care outcomes India ( TITCO ) . It collect four public university hospital India October 2013 January 2015 . The hospital Mumbai , Delhi Kolkata . The two center Mumbai King Edward Memorial Hospital Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital . The one Delhi Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center one Kolkata Institute Post-Graduate Medical Education Research Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital . The data collect one trained project officer hospital , work eight-hour shift rotate schedule day , even night shift . Data patient admit outside shift hour collect retrospectively within day arrival hospital . The patient follow discharge , death maximum 30 day . If discharge , patient consider alive 30 day . There follow-up patient discharge 30 day . Source method participant selection Project officer include consecutive patient present participate hospital . Patients include either direct observation project officer ' shift retrospective data extraction patient record . Data sources/ measurement Patient mortality data extract patient record , data covariates . If covariate data miss record attempt make retrieve data patient patient relative . The injury data extract patient record , include image report intraoperative finding . Protocols post-mortem examination available . Injuries cod use ICD-10 . The SRR ICD-code calculate divide number fatal outcomes ICD-code total number patient ICD-code . This result number 0 1 interpreted patient survival ratio . For example , 65 100 patient give ICD-code survive SRR code would 0,65 . That would mean 65 % patient ICD code survive . In study , SRRs use ICISS calculation take publicly available SRR-set calculate TITCO dataset ( TO BE RELEASED ) . The ICISS patient calculate use two different approach . The cICISS calculate product patient 's SRRs . The swiICISS equal patient 's low SRR . Both ICISS method result number range 0 1 interpreted patient specific probability survival . Bias The project officer train project management . They involve patient care acquire data observe hospital staff , use patient record patient relative . All project officer least health science master 's degree continuously supervise project management . Injury coder blind patient demographic mortality data conversion free-text injury ICD-codes train prior ICD-10 coding use World Health Organization ( WHO ) ICD-10 online training module . They gain access injury dataset first reach 80 % agreement several sample 50 injury compare external coder . Study size The sample size calculation base publish recommendation effective sample size need validate prediction model . These recommendation base simulation sample size need detect statistically significant difference predictive performance measure two score set power 80 % significance level 5 % . Hence , require sample size calculate include recent 200 consecutive event , i.e . patient die within 24 hour , non-events enrol time period . Mortality within 24 hour use sample size calculation investigator want study power secondary outcome also . Quantitative variable All quantitative variable analyze continuous . Statistical method analyse The investigator use R statistical analysis . Predictive performance assess term discrimination calibration . Discrimination assess calculate area receiver operate characteristic curve ( AUROCC ) calibration assess compare observe predicted outcome visually calibration plot statistically calculate calibration slope . Confidence interval predictive performance measure estimate use bootstrap approach ( 15 ) . Overlapping confidence interval interpret evidence lack statistically significant difference . Parametric non-parametric exact test use appropriate , 95 % confidence interval 5 % significance level . The main analysis complete case analysis , observation miss value follow variable exclude : time arrival , age , sex , mechanism injury , transfer status , outcome variable . Observations injury report assigned ICISS score 1 observation final ICISS score calculate base SRRs ICD-codes occur least ten time publish SRR-set use study . The publish SRR-set include SRRs base mortality within 30 day , henceforth refer SRR-30D , SRRs base mortality within 24 hour , henceforth refer SRR-24H . The investigator use SRRs calculate cICISS swiICISS patient , henceforth refer cICISS-30D , cICISS-24H , swiICISS-30D swiICISS-24H . Finally , investigator assess compare performance cICISS-30D swiICISS-30D predicting mortality within 30 day within 24 hour , repeat analysis cICISS-24H swiICISS-24H . Sensitivity analyse Four sensitivity analysis conduct . In first sensitivity analysis investigator include observation complete outcome data , however miss value covariates allow . In second sensitivity analysis investigator exclude observation without reported injury . In third sensitivity analysis investigator calculate cICISS swiICISS base available SRRs , regardless frequently correspond ICD-10 code occur dataset . Finally , investigator calculate two ICISS score patient base unique ICD-10 code . In word , ICD-10 code allow contribute one SRR ICISS score even occur patient .</detailed_description>
