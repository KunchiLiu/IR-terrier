	<brief_summary>The propose study multi-institutional , phase I/II study disulfiram ( DSF ) patient presume glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) base magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) biopsy , include administration surgery adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Patients treat 3 day preoperative DSF/copper ( Cu ) prior surgery ( biopsy ) , follow collection blood tumor sample surgery analysis drug uptake . After surgery , patient receive standard radiation therapy ( RT ) temozolomide ( TMZ ) addition concurrent DSF/Cu .</brief_summary>

Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) least 60 % For patient participate optional preoperative DSF pharmacokinetic study , eligible surgical resection least 0.2 cubic cm approximately 200 mg tumor remove additional tumor specimen require pathology evaluation . Patients enrol undergoing surgical resection biopsy histologically confirm GBM require meet point inclusion . Eligible plan receive standard fractionate RT concurrent TMZ . Willing remain abstinent consume alcohol DSF . Willing defer definitive surgery one week take DSF Cu . Patients decline optional preoperative pharmacokinetic study enrol undergoing surgical resection biopsy histologically confirm GBM require meet point inclusion .
