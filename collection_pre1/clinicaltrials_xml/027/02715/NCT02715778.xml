	<brief_summary>Although last decade bring major advance respect knowledge certain risk associate fetal exposure psychiatric medication , critical information regard long-term neurobehavioral impact fetal exposure lack . With prevalence rate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) use across pregnancy Western country note high 5-8 % , study aim close gap knowledge regard long-term neurobehavioral sequela utero exposure class antidepressant . Importantly , assessment impact antenatal psychotropic medication use must conduct appreciation potential direct indirect effect maternal psychiatric illness pregnancy throughout childhood . The outcome study help inform care reproductive age woman treat psychiatric medication , along clinician prescribe , weigh relative risk use agent pregnancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuropsychological evaluation old child previously study history fetal exposure antidepressant maternal depression pregnancy need may inform whether signal neural disruption exist follow fetal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) exposure . Identification genetic factor may afford resilience particular vulnerability fetal exposure antidepressant logical component translational initiative design answer propose research question . Because hypothesis prenatal exposure gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -based drug influence excitatory/inhibitory balance shift critical period , reason believe aspect brain development may also alter . To end , project aim `` scan '' variety brain function include memory , attention , executive function ; addition , also examine extent face speech processing alter target sample . This study ass old child age 6-17 history fetal exposure antidepressant and/or maternal depression pregnancy . It evaluate child behavior base maternal report utilize neuropsychological evaluation inform whether signal neural disruption exist follow fetal SSRI depression exposure . The neuropsychological assessment pair analysis genetic factor may afford resilience particular vulnerability fetal exposure antidepressant . This study leverage unique patient resource respect child mother well documented history SSRI exposure prospectively follow across pregnancy . The multidisciplinary collaboration lead investigator , Dr. Lee S. Cohen Center Women 's Mental Health ( CWMH ) , Laboratories Cognitive Neuroscience , Boston Children 's Hospital ( Dr. Charles Nelson ) , Department Molecular Cellular Biology , Psychiatric Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit Massachusetts General Hospital ( Dr. Jordan Smoller ) remarkable opportunity well understand effect maternal antidepressant exposure pregnancy neuropsychological development child .</detailed_description>
