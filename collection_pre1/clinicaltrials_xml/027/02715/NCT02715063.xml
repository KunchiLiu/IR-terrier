	<brief_summary>Several study show relationship exercise intensity improvement cardiometabolic health body composition , endothelial function , blood pressure blood lipid . It suggest high intensity interval training also strength resistance training generate positive effect metabolic risk factor , nevertheless comparison type train combination yet provide conclusive evidence . Also , show dietary restriction similar positive effect exercise alone effect great combine exercise . For reason , necessary clarify type training , combination dietary restriction , effective improve cardiometabolic health</brief_summary>
