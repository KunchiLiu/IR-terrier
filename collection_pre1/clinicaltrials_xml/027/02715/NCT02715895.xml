	<detailed_description>1 . Sample size：Seventy two case enrol breast milk group , 144 case formula milk group , 72 case commercially available formula subgroup Friso formula subgroup 36 case every hospital ( 18 male infant 18 female infant ) . 2 . Observation period：Observational period maintain 12 week . Infants breast milk group feed breast milk inclusion trial process . In formula milk group , subject feed formula instead commercially available formula Friso formula inclusion , wash-out period 2 week necessary . 3 . Random method : In commercially available formula subgroup Friso formula subgroup , infant include randomly . Random allocation sequence generate six trial center editorial department Chinese Journal Evidence-Based Pediatrics , include infant choose information include name , gender , parent ' name telephone report editorial department Chinese Journal Evidence-Based Pediatrics via WeChat . Then group division information acquire , test commercially available formula Friso formula give infant accordingly . 4 . Match breast milk group : Infants purely breast milk-fed chosen . Infants'gender body weight ( ±5 % ) breast match milk-fed group commercially available formula subgroup Friso formula subgroup . 5 . Blinding method : Subjects , doctor nurse know formula give . Personals charge assess stool character ery secretion , data analysis , blind information group division . 6 . Data record , monitor management 6.1 Data record 6.1.1 Original record : Subjects ' follow-up care card original file clinical trial duplicate copy . One copy save hospital . Original record shall traceable . Each researcher must strictly follow principle GCP ensure record observation discovery follow-up care card case report form ( CRF ) , data consistent , optional change allow . If correction need , original record must change , researcher add extra description explain reason , correction need sign dated researcher make . 6.1.2 Case report form ( CRF ) : Each triplicate , deliver sponsor , main institution clinical research participate institution clinical research . According principle GCP , subject ' name appear order ensure privacy . Subjects ' name must fill initial . All choice '' □ '' mark '' × '' . If inspection item examine missed reason , fill : examine . If specific formula dosage unknown , fill : unknown . When filled number , fill □ . If digit enough , fill right side . If left side empty , fill 0 . No null term miss item allow . Researchers must ensure data must consistent original record . If modifying , researcher draw horizontal line middle original record text , sidenote modify , sign modifier 's name date . He must smear cover original record . 6.1.3 Data Record subject ' guardian : It record accord item definition design CRF chart . 6.1.4 Extremum principle : The data , deviate significantly outside acceptable range clinically , must verify . Clinical doctor must make necessary instruction . 6.1.5 Data registration preservation : Every time follow-up visit , researcher record require information case report sheet timely . After end subject ' observed period , researcher accurately record relevant information original record form data CRF within 7 day . CRF , inform consent document examine signed project leader , save archive office institution . If problem find , timely dealt record . 6.2 Data monitoring Editorial Board Chinese Journal Evidence-Based Pediatrics charge data monitor clinical trial . CJEBP provide data monitor clinical trial FrieslandCampina regularly middle experiment stage later experiment stage . During trial , CJEBP investigate 6 research center quality practice least one time , without announcement advance . The monitoring subject include child care doctor , nurse guardian subject enrol trial . 6.2.1 Child care doctor : monitor quality explain research subject ' guardian inform consent signing ; Random distribution ; The accurate measurement body length , weight head-circumference ; judgement gut intolerance ; record stool frequency , picture stool eye secretion . 6.2.2 Nurses : motor accuracy measure equipment ; correctness measure method ; rightness data recording ( mean value 2 measurement ) ; management trial formula ( reception time , check-up , distribution subject , date signature , recycle subject , date , quantity rest formula signature ) . 6.2.3 Guardians subject enrol trial : randomly inspect 1-2 guardian , investigate whether mixed feed mixed brand formula feed exists ; usage trial formula ; regularity follow-up visit ; take photo fresh stool eye secretion . 6.3 Data management 6.3.1 Buildup , test data entry WeChat client : According project CRF，administrators establish WeChat client , test modify client , enter data ensure accuracy client . Every researcher hospital uploads measure data administrator WeChat client day complete one case observation measurement . In order ensure accuracy data , administrator compare data upload WeChat client original CRF . Subjects ' guardian upload photos stool character eye secretion administrator WeChat client 3 point follow-up time . 6.3.2 Generation correction doubt , quality control ( QC ) database shutdown : After complete data input comparison , data administrator verify reliability , integrity accuracy data accord requirement clinical trial scheme . If finds loss content logic contradiction fill wrong uncertain data , clinical monitor send clinical trial center form data question table ( DQF ) . Researchers give answer question soon possible reply . Data administrator modify , confirm correct data accord researcher ' answer . After solve problem , quality control personnels check quality database accord QC plan . Then close database check . 6.3.3 Data check , lock transmit blindly : Data administrator submit data management report , require meet data-check blindly attend principal investigator , statistical analyst , data administrator , monitor , sponsor . Check data blindly , sign blindly data-check resolution meeting , lock database ; lock data analyze personnel statistical analysis . 7 . Statistic analysis 7.1 General principle : All statistical test must two-sided test , P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant difference test . Mean , median , standard deviation , maximum , minimum , 25 % 75 % quintile use statistical description measurement data . Count data level data describe frequency ( percentage ) . SAS9.1.3 statistical software use statistical analysis . 7.2 Analysis miss case : List case number inclusion , completion fall . Loss rate comparison group analyze Chi-square test Fisher 's exact probability method . 7.3 Evaluation effectiveness : Measurement data index ( Growth rate height , weight head circumference 4,8,12 week , defication frequency ) analyze normality test firstly . If data conforms normal distribution , comparation formula milk group ( commercially available formula subgroup Friso formula subgroup ) breast milk group analyse One-Way ANOVA method . LSD method use multiple comparison . If data conform normal distribution , Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test use . A level significance α=0.05 ( two-tailed ) . Frequency data index ( incidence constipation 4,8,12 week , eye secretion ) record case percentage . If theoretical frequency &lt; 5 total observe frequency &lt; 30 , Fisher 's exact probability method use ; otherwise Chi-square test use . A level significance α=0.05 ( two-tailed ) . 8 . Quality control Standardized operation procedure establish research process . 8.1 Qualification research institution : Research institution must community health service center qualify baby healthy check-up . 8.2 Qualification researcher : The researcher need GCP training work guidance senior professional . 8.3 Trial quality control measure : ①Before start clinical trial , researcher ( include nurse ) must receive training measurement height , weight head circumference ; ②check measurement bed measurement everyday . Researchers must compare scale plastic flexible rule standard steel rule change plastic flexible error &gt; 0.1cm . ③The picture feces eye independently score 2 specialist condition unknowing group . ④The specialist must responsible experimental formula , counter lock , storage room temperature away light . The remain experimental formula store separately , register number . At end trial , remain experimental formula send back sponsor.⑤Monitor : Monitor appoint sponsor , ensure subject ' interest period trial . Trial record data report must true , accurate , complete correct , ensure trial must comply approved plan Relevant law . 9 . Definition management adverse event 9.1 Definition adverse event : adverse event define occur patient subject clinical study receives test product , event necessarily causal relationship test product . Adverse event diseases sign symptom occur course study ( include abnormal laboratory finding ) . Adverse event serious serious , may may cause subject withdraw study . All adverse event must record , relationship product product evaluate . 9.2 Information collection adverse event : researcher must know record follow information concern adverse event : subject date , description event , source report , suspect product , continuous time , frequency , extent , severity , measure take , result complication , relationship test product . 9.3 Extent adverse event : Mild : symptom obvious , slightly harmful health . Middle : symptom obvious , tolerate , without immediate treatment . Serious : hard bear . 9.4 Severity adverse event : Serious adverse event refer follwing adverse event appear dosage : leading death , threaten life , need hospitalize hospitalization prolong , result permanent significant disability loss function , congenital anomaly birth defect , significant medical event . Not serious : Those event define serious adverse event serious event . 9.5 Unexpected expect serious adverse event : Researchers must assess whether adverse event expect occur . Expectation evaluate Safety Officer Medical base current knowledge exist product information . An unexpected adverse event one nature , severity , frequency inconsistent condition study ( ) product information . All suspected adverse event relate tested product , well serious adverse event expect serious consider SUSARs ( suspicious unexpected serious adverse event ) . SUSAR need report management authority independent ethic committee short time . According Chinese food Drug Administration report adverse reaction regulation drug supervision , new serious adverse reaction drug must report within 15 day , death must report immediately . Fax : +86-10-67184591 , Email : report @ adr.gov.cn . 9.6 Relationship test product : Medical institution evaluate relationship adverse event test product accord following standard . ① unrelevant : evidence prove adverse event cause reason . For example , adverse event obviously cause disease , adverse event consistant effect adverse reaction drug , adverse event already exist use tested product research . ② Not likely relevant : seem time-relationship use test product , occurrence adverse event explain reason . ③Probably relevant : seem time-relationship use test product , adverse event seem causal relationship product . ④ Surely relevant : seem time-relationship use test product , reason explain occurrence adverse event . Adverse event diminish disappear stop use test product , symptom occur use test product . 9.7 report record : ①serious adverse event : clinical safety management must inform fax scan within 24 hour , regardless whether event relate tested product . When 's first time report , time SAE need modification , researcher need complete serious adverse event spreadsheet eCRF , The spreadsheet automaticly send clinical safety manager xt211311 @ aliyun.com form email . All serious adverse event also require eCRF spreadsheet severity column choose `` serious '' . ②Not serious adverse event : serious adverse event must record eCRF 's adverse event page . 9.8 follow-up visit : All serious adverse event follow outcome event . The researcher need inform clinical safety manager follow-up information within 24 hour , change diagnosis , result , date remission , termination treatment , . If serious adverse event persist discontinuation study , follow-up require . In addition , adverse event occur , 's necessary evaluate causal relationship adverse event test product , examination laboratory result must record case report form attach document . Within 30 day last use study product , SAE also need reported way within 24 hour . 9.9 Inform : The sponsor responsible safety evaluation test product . The sponsor must promptly inform researcher , observational hospital regulatory authority discovery likely affect subject ' safety , influence study process , change ethic committee 's attitude approve agree research continue . 9.10 Report : The sponsor must accelerate reporting investigator , observational hospital , IRB ( S ) /IEC ( ) management authority ( necessary ) serious suspicious unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ) . This accelerated report need comply applicable regulatory requirement , ICH guideline management clinical safety data : standard accelerate reporting . The sponsor submit late progress stag report security management authority , accord applicable regulatory requirement</detailed_description>
