	<detailed_description>This study aim generate knowledge need address seemingly intractable urban service delivery challenge : 1 ) lack engagement low-income youth serious disruptive behavioral disorder family ; 2 ) clinic offer family-based , evidence-informed service ; 3 ) lack scalable , empirically support intervention design resource-strapped child setting ; 4 ) empirically support option public policy maker support uptake integration service innovation system . A multiple family group ( MFG ) family-centered , group deliver , evidence-informed , manualized intervention target common reason referral publicly fund clinic : youth oppositional defiant conduct disorders.5,6 MFGs target family factor consistently implicate onset maintenance childhood behavioral disorders.7-9 integrate component exist evidence-based practice ( EBPs ) . The MFG service delivery model develop collaboration urban parent service provider address serious challenge associate EBP roll-outs : low rate family involvement ; poor uptake provider ; clinic provider impediment maintain fidelity ; attenuate child outcome effect . These obstacle pervasively associate living provide care within poverty-impacted community resource scarce , urban child behavioral health system . Findings recently complete NIMH-funded R01 trial , `` Family Groups Urban Youth Disruptive Behavior '' ( R01 MH R01072649 ; PI : McKay ) , reveal MFGs associate significant improvement relative standard care ( SC ) : 1 ) rate family engagement retention ( 80 % complete ) ; 2 ) short- ( 16 week ) long-term ( 10 month ) improvement child conduct problem impairment ; 3 ) improvement parent family process . Although promising , early study systematically examine specific mechanisms family-level change hypothesize influence child behavior . Further , although clinic director ( n=13 ) MFG provider ( n= 62 ) express strong endorsement MFGs urban , resource constrain site , significant implementation challenge emerge , potentially compromise future fidelity sustainability . Thus , clinic provider-level moderator MFG implementation integration examine current study . The propose study also examine specific implementation strategy base social-organizational theory ( PRISM ) . Specifically , investigator experimentally test impact local child mental health clinic implementation team ( CITs ) , consist supervisor , service provider family partner , implementation integration MFG . CITs create site-specific plan enhance multi-level implementation process ( e.g . clinic readiness adopt innovation , leadership support , provider preparedness , motivation fidelity ) order increase likelihood integrate MFGs urban child behavioral health clinic . The propose study , response RFA 15-320 , Clinical Trials Test Effectiveness Treatment , Preventative , Services Interventions , employ mixed method Type II effectiveness-implementation hybrid research design . In collaboration NYS Office Mental Health ( OMH ) , longitudinal study conduct across NYC OMH license child behavioral health clinic system ( n=134 ) . The investigator use mixed method , involve 268 provider 2,688 adult caregiver youth ( 7 11 year ) . This study examine : 1. short-term longitudinal impact MFGs urban youth ODD CD ( replication ) ; 2. family-level mediator ( e.g . parenting , family process ) child outcome ; 3. clinic ( readiness adopt innovation , leadership support climate ) provider level moderator ( preparedness , motivation fidelity ) MFG implementation ( Phase I ) integration ( Phase II ) ; 4. impact CITs clinic provider level moderator MFG implementation ( Phase I ) integration ( Phase II ) . In RCT , clinic stratify borough ( Manhattan , Queens , Bronx , Brooklyn , Staten Island ) randomly assign within borough 3 study condition : 1 ) MFG+CITs ; 2 ) MFG ( standard research training consultation ) ; 3 ) Standard Care . Data collect baseline , 8 16 week 6 mo . follow-up ) Phase 1 ( focus implementation ) Phase II ( integration ) . The investigator team include high level NYSOMH research policy leadership . McKay Hoagwood co-Directors NYS Clinic Technical Assistance Center , NIMH-funded Advanced Center Implementation Evidence-based Practice Children State Systems ( IDEAS ; P30 MH09032 ) Center Collaborative Urban Child Mental Health Services Research ( CCCR ; P20 MH085983 ) . Advanced methodological expertise ( Jaccard , Palinkas ) , policy ( Hogan , Bradbury , Goldman ) , family ( Kuppinger ) provider ( Cleek , Perri ) consultation IDEAS/CCCR Center advisor position study maximum public health impact . This team uniquely prepared build exist research service infrastructure within state public mental health system conduct study . Because nationally-focused center partnership NYSOMH , finding study immediately actionable .</detailed_description>
