	<brief_summary>Post-operative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) common complication encounter cardiac surgery ; report show POAF occur ~ 35 % patient CABG . Prophylactic use amiodarone find effective , however , due serious extracardiac adverse effect therapy probably appropriate patient high risk POAF . common practice management POAF treatment intravenous Amiodarone return sinus rhythm , follow drug give orally . Our protocol involve continue treatment amiodarone 30 day post-discharge hospital dose 200mg per day . This protocol common practice many cardiac surgical department worldwide , nevertheless , evidence-based protocol never examine .

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) widespread complication encounter cardiac surgery , associate prolonged hospitalization , morbidity , mortality , annual cost $ 1 billion American healthcare system . AF report predict postoperative stroke , congestive heart failure , late AF among patient undergo mitral valve surgery . Postoperative AF ( POAF ) occur 62 % patient undergoing combined aortic valve coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , 49 % patient undergoing aortic valve surgery alone , 42 % patient undergoing mitral valve surgery , 32 % patient undergoing CABG surgery alone . These figure expect rise future , give patient undergo cardiac surgery get elder incidence AF general population markedly age-dependent . POAF peak incidence occur 2nd 3rd postoperative day ( PODs ) . Seventy percent patient develop arrhythmia end 4th POD 94 % end 6th . Although generally well-tolerated see temporary problem relate surgery , POAF life-threatening , particularly elderly patient leave ventricular dysfunction . Recent guideline prevention management POAF jointly publish 2006 American College Cardiology , American Heart Association ( AHA ) , European Society Cardiology . These guideline recommend ( ) preoperative treatment oral beta-blocker drug prevention POAF class IA indication , ( ii ) preoperative administration amiodarone patient high risk POAF class IIA indication . Amiodarone associate several complication , cardiac , extracardiac ; among cardiac complication , predominantly relate increase risk bradycardia hypotension , particularly ( ) administer intravenously , ( ii ) use average daily dose exceed 1 g , ( iii ) initiate prophylaxis postoperative period.45 Among severe extracardiac complication , amiodarone associate thyroid toxicity , lung fibrosis , corneal damage , may aggravate drug 's delay onset action ( 2 - 3 day ) long elimination half-life time ( 6 month ) . Currently common practice management POAF treatment intravenous Amiodarone return sinus rhythm , follow drug give orally . Our protocol involve continue treatment amiodarone 30 day post-discharge hospital dose 200mg per day . This protocol common practice many cardiac surgical department worldwide , nevertheless , evidence-based protocol never examine . This study randomize placebo control trial , evaluate requirement post-discharge treatment oral Amiodarone .</detailed_description>
