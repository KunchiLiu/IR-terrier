	<brief_title>Single-dose Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacodynamics REMD-477 Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two site United States , approximately 20 subject type 1 diabetes enrol . Eligible subject admit clinical research unit , carefully monitor blood glucose ; establish baseline insulin requirement maintain target normoglycemia ( postabsorptive : 90-120 mg/dL ; postprandial : &lt; 180 mg/dL ) . The patient subject hyperglycemic period ( 250-300 mg/dL ) stepwise reduction insulin infusion . After receive single SC dose REMD-477 match placebo double-blinded fashion , subject assess post-treatment 24-hour insulin requirement need maintain target normoglycemia ( postabsorptive : 90-120 mg/dL ; postprandial : &lt; 180 mg/dL ) ; monitor closely safety , tolerability target glycemic control , 48-hr period . After in-patient residency period , subject return clinic weekly out-patient safety follow-up visit 8 week .</detailed_description>
