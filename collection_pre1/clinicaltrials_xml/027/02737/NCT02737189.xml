	<brief_summary>Endovascular treatment acute ischemic stroke show strong benefit several prospective randomize trial anterior circulation endovascular therapy basilar artery occlusion show promising result several single-arm study . This lead broad adoption technique consider standard care many institution despite lack adequate evidence prove benefit . Indeed , rate symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage study consistently around 5 % raise question whether patient could actually harm opposed helped procedure . This prospective , multi-center , randomize , control , open , blinded-endpoint trial , aim evaluate hypothesis mechanical embolectomy Solitaire device superior medical management alone achieve well outcomes subject present acute ischemic stroke cause occlusion basilar artery within 6-24 hour symptom onset .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objective : To evaluate hypothesis mechanical embolectomy Solitaire device superior medical management alone achieve meaningful outcome ( good death equivalent ) define modify Rankin score ( mRS ) 0-4 90 day subject present ischemic stroke due basilar artery occlusion 24 hour symptom onset . Subject Population : Subjects present acute ischemic stroke within 6-24 hour symptom onset/last see well whose stroke attributable occlusion basilar artery . Subjects either ineligible IV alteplase receive IV alteplase therapy without recanalization . The randomization employ 1:1 ratio mechanical embolectomy Solitaire stentriever conjunction manual aspiration versus medical management alone . Randomization do stratification process use age , baseline National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) therapeutic window . For primary endpoint , subject follow 90 day post-randomization.Sample size project 318 patient . Care provider : Vascular neurologist train interventional neuroradiologists neurologist certify comprehensive stroke center treat 500 acute stroke patient perform 30 acute mechanical thrombectomy every year treat patient . Neurointerventionalists previously perform least 10 thrombectomy Solitaire device acute ischemic stroke patient . Interventions : Patients arm admit acute stroke unit ( Intensive Care Unit need ) treat follow Chinese Guidelines Early Management Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke . Concomitant medication non-pharmacological therapy record . If decision stop support life measure adopt , record Case Report Form ( CRF ) .A maximum six attempt retrieve thrombus single vessel make Solitaire device aspiration . In case atherosclerotic lesion find underlying occlusive lesion angioplasty/stenting detachment Solitaire device allow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Acute ischemic stroke due basilar artery occlusion within 624 hour symptom onset，where patient ineligible IV thrombolytic treatment treatment contraindicate ( e.g. , subject present beyond recommended time symptom onset ) , patient receive IV thrombolytic therapy without recanalization . 2 . Occlusion basilar artery ( TIMI 01 ) evidence CTA , MRA angiogram . 3 . Age ≥18 ≤80 year . 4 . Baseline NIHSS score obtain prior randomization ≥10 . 5 . No significant prestroke disability ( mRS ≤1 ) . 6 . Subject treatable within 24 hour symptom onset time last see baseline ( i.e. , subject stroke symptom upon awaken consider `` onset '' begin sleep ; subject find new stroke symptom unable communicate actual time symptom onset consider `` onset '' last time see well ) . Treatment initiation define groin access site puncture . Symptoms onset include vertigo , diplopia , midline ataxia , visual loss , sensory motor deficit . 7 . Anticipated life expectancy least 1 year . 8 . Informed consent obtain Subject acceptable Subject Surrogate . 1 . Known hemorrhagic diathesis , coagulation factor deficiency , oral anticoagulant therapy International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ＞3.0 2 . Baseline platelet count ＜50000/µL 3 . Baseline blood glucose ＜50mg/dL ＞400mg/dL . 4 . Severe , sustain hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ＞220 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure ＞110 mm Hg ) Note : If blood pressure successfully reduce maintain acceptable level use local treatment guideline recommend medication ( include iv antihypertensive drip ) , patient enrol . 5 . Intubated patient transfer could randomize case NIHSS obtain neurologist prior transportation . 6 . Seizures stroke onset would preclude obtain baseline NIHSS . 7 . History life threaten allergy ( rash ) contrast medium . 8 . Subjects receive iv recombinant tissue plasminogen activator （rtPA）treatment beyond 4.5 hour begin symptom . 9 . Patients acute stroke within first 48 hour percutaneous cardiac , cerebrovascular intervention major surgery ( beyond 48h randomized exclude poor medical condition ) 10 . Renal insufficiency creatinine ≥3 mg/dL . 11 . Woman childbearing potential know pregnant lactate positive pregnancy test admission . 12 . Subject participate study involve investigational drug device would impact study . 13 . Cerebral vasculitis . 14 . Patients preexist neurological psychiatric disease would confound neurological functional evaluation , mRS score baseline must ≤1 . This exclude patient severely demented , require constant assistance nursing home type set live home fully independent activity daily live ( toileting , dress , eat , cook prepare meal , etc . ) 15 . Unlikely available 1 year followup ( e.g . fix home address , visitor overseas ) . 16 . Posterior circulation ASPECTS ＜6 Ponsmidbrainindex ≥3 . 17 . CT MR evidence hemorrhage ( presence microbleeds allow ) . 18 . Complete cerebellar infarct CT MRI significant mass effect compression 4th ventricle . 19 . Complete thalamic infarction CT MRI . 20 . Evidence vertebral occlusion , high grade stenosis arterial dissection extracranial petrous segment vessel treat prevent access intracranial clot excessive tortuosity cervical vessel preclude device delivery/deployment . 21 . Subjects occlusion multiple vascular territory ( anterior circulation posterior circulation ) . 22 . Evidence intracranial tumor ( except small meningioma ) .</criteria>
