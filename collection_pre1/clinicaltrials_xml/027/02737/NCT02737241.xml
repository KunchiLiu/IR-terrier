	<detailed_description>Introduction Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) pathologic process contributes , sole cause , low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) age men . The decision intervene frequently use end point failure different medical therapy . These medication able delay point . Failed medical treatment either due refractory LUTS patient willing make lifetime commitment medical therapy represent one indication intervene . Urine retention secondary BPH fail void trial without catheter indication intervention healthy individual well recurrent hematuria , secondary vesical stone recurrent urinary tract infection . Renal deterioration secondary BPH indication intervention proper evaluation bladder function . For year , surgical treatment BPH transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) small moderate size prostate open prostatectomy ( OP ) markedly enlarge one . Laser prostatectomy introduce less invasive modality treatment BPH overcoming disadvantage limitation traditional standard TURP OP . It seem advantageous less invasive OP . Furthermore , use physiological saline irrigant , high safety profile morbid patient anticoagulant antiplatelet surgery . It use tackle large prostate gland beyond limit TURP . It infrequent do day surgery shorten catheterization time . Eventually seem cost effective , however remain concern minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) durability reoperation rate . Despite significant advantage know laser prostatectomy technique particularly HoLEP , adoption procedure urologic community limit one cause high initial cost investment laser capital equipment . HoLEP entail dissection whole median lateral prostatic lobe surgical capsule via retrograde approach start apex . The enucleated lobe push bladder follow hemostasis prostate bed intravesical morcellation enucleate adenoma . Over past 15 year , different technical modification come procedure . However current report use 100 watt laser power ( High power HoLEP : HP-HoLEP ) laser assist enucleation technique . Khan et al 2015 , report feasibility use low power ( LP-HoLEP ) safe effective HoLEP . The author cut significantly initial cost laser capital equipment . They use 50-watt holmium laser machine accomplish enucleation procedure reasonable efficacy . Nevertheless , randomize study assess safety , efficacy cost save associate LP-HoLEP . Aim Work This study aim compare safety efficacy LP-HoLEP vs HP-HoLEP treatment infra-vesical obstruction secondary BPH . Patients Methods Study design : Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) Study population : BPH surgical candidate present outpatient clinic prostate unit urology department ( Urology &amp; nephrology center , Mansoura University ) assess evaluate patient eligible study inclusion criterion . BPH surgical candidate patient present LUTS secondary BOO ( bladder outlet obstruction ) due BPH fail medical treatment , IPSS ( international prostate symptom score ) score &gt; 15 , peak urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) &lt; 15 ml/sec , recurrent attack urine retention fail trial voiding , patient hematuria prostatic origin fail medical treatment patient vesical stone secondary BPH . Preoperative work : All patient thoroughly evaluate medical history physical exam , digital rectal exam ( DRE ) , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , urinalysis urine culture , international index prostate symptom score ( IPSS ) , transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) measurement prostatic volume biopsy whenever indicate , measurement post-void residual assessment ( PVR ) , maximum urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) . Patients positive urine culture treat accordingly . Randomization : Patients randomly assign study group day surgery signing inform consent participation study . The randomization process perform use computer-generated random table 1:1 ratio . A stratified-blocked randomization across two stratum derive predetermined size grouping ( 40-80 ml 80 ml ) two stratum derive preoperative indication ( catheterize non-catheterized ) do . This method ensure parity among two treatment group . In stratum , give two possible block length four eight respectively , random number generator give number uniformly distribute 0 1 , investigator select block length four random number low 0.5 block length eight otherwise . Variation block size prevent surgeon guess next treatment ; make difficult ( although impossible ) break treatment code . Eligible patient randomize one two group : Group 1 ( 50 patient ) : Patients manage HP-HoLEP . Group 2 ( 50 patient ) : Patients manage LP-HoLEP . Procedure : In case coexist urinary bladder stone , Holmium laser cystolithotripsy do first . Laser setting : - HP-HoLEP : ( Energy=2 Joule , Rate=50 Hertz ) adenoma enucleation &amp; reduce ( Energy=1.5 , Rate=30 ) apical dissection &amp; hemostasis . - LP-HoLEP : ( Energy=2 Joule , Rate=25 ) throughout whole procedure . Surgical Technique : HoLEP divide four phase : inspection , enucleation , hemostasis morcellation . Briefly , plane create adenoma surgical capsule early first incision gland bladder neck level verumontanum . The gland enucleate two three lobe depend anatomy prominence groove either side middle lobe . The Two-lobe technique start 5- 7-O'clock incision groove median lobe one lateral lobe ( deeper groove ) enucleation one lateral lobe , follow median remain lateral lobe single unit . The three-lobe technique involve 5- 7- O'clock incision enucleation median lobe subsequent enucleation one lateral lobe follow lateral lobe . If bleeding encounter , laser fiber defocused slightly bleed point achieve hemostasis . Furosemide ( 20 mg/hour , intravenously ) administer one hour surgery , correct fluid absorption enhance urine flow . After hemostasis , morcellator introduce prostatic lobe morcellated remove . Follow-up : Patients see follow-up 2-4 week , 4 month , 12 month . Validated questionnaire utilized ass patient ` sexual function base line different follow-up visit . Different aspect sexual function analyze . In patient may symptomatic improvement procedure may subsequent deterioration , cystoscopy perform rule development urethral stricture bladder neck contracture . Treatment plan accordingly present finding . Outcome measure : Primary outcome : The primary outcome clinical trial operative outcome measure include : Operative time ; time insertion resectoscope till time catheterization , operative efficacy ; number gram resect prostate tissue weight divide operative time , enucleation efficacy ( study endpoint ) ; number gram resect prostate tissue divide enucleation time , laser / prostate ratio ; amount joule laser energy spend remove one gram prostate tissue peri-procedure blood change : Hg deficit , Hct deficit , Na change . Secondary outcome : These parameter include ; time catheter removal , duration hospital stay complication ( intraoperative , early postoperative first 30 day procedure , late postoperative ) . Furthermore , urinary outcome measure ( IPSS ; international prostate symptom score , QOL ; quality life , Q-max ; peak flow rate , PVR ; post void residual ) sexual outcome measure ( Changes IIEF-15 ; international index erectile function-15 ) depict compare . Tertiary outcome : The cumulative health resource relate cost analysis procedures local institutional perspective ( actual cost ) . Costs link medical staff include assumed identical 2 group , similarly routine clinic visit include . Participants ' flow diagram ( CONSORT CHART ) : For group , number participant randomly assign , receive intend treatment , analyze primary outcome . Losses exclusion describe group . Sample size statistical analysis : In study , investigator test non-inferiority LP-HoLEP HP-HoLEP accomplish transurethral enucleation procedure comparable enucleation efficacy pertain advantage low cost potential minimal postoperative dysuria . Type 1 statistical error le 5 % type 2 statistical error le 20 % consider . Furthermore , base previous report , enucleation efficacy use LP-HoLEP report 0.68 + 0.4 , 95 % CI 0.61-0.75 gm/min ( 7 ) acceptable non-inferiority margin 0.2gm/min consider . Considering previous factor , sample size 100 patient ( 50 group ) estimate</detailed_description>
