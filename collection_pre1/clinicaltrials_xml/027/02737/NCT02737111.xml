	<detailed_description>Background Information Study Rationale : An ICC comprise number condition affect either heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ) , electrical circuit heart ( ion channelopathies ) . ICCs result heart work ineffectively , dangerous arrhythmia sudden death . The last decade see dramatic advance understand pathology ICCs . More 50 ICCs recognise genetics test increasingly available . Epidemiological evidence suggests combine total prevalence ICCs 340,000 UK . In response advance medical genetic understanding ICCs , ICC service also grow dramatically , accompany commissiioning guideline , ICC diagnose implication patient relative . For family affect inherited cardiac condition , layer impact complex . When child receives positive diagnosis implication parent sibling live child 's diagnosis , also one 's health wellbeing . This lead uncertainty health others family subsequent medical investigates . To researcher ' knowledge , little publish evidence aim understand experience child sibling communication around ICC condition . Therefore ICC service risk rely clinical intuition view parent rather hear directly child young people . This present study therefore propose explore qualitatively family experience communication positive diagnosis inherit cardiac condition child seek perspective child diagnosis , sibling parent . Participants recruit ICC service NHS Hospital London . Paedaitric patient ( give ICC diagnosis ) sibling age 8-16 , Parents . Patient recruitment site commence trial team ensure follow approval/essential document place : 1 . The main REC approval , 2 . Final sponsorship and/or R &amp; D approval ( NHS Permission ) , 3 . Local Site Delegation Duties Signature Log complete . All subject wish enter study fully screen consented Chief Investigator ( CI ) , one qualify clinician involve study Researchers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Children age 8 16 receive positive diagnosis inherit cardiac condition ICC service hospital within last 3 month , parent sibling . 2 . Siblings child receive diagnosis inherit cardiac condition age 8 16 year . 3 . Children participate already aware diagnosis sibling 's diagnosis . 4 . Children participate parent/person parental responsibility consent take part . 5 . Parents take part give informed consent 1 . Children unable communicate verbally include research would unable consent involvement research alternative mean data collection would require . Discontinuation/ withdrawal Pariticpants Stopping Rules : Participants withdraw participation study time without give reason happens , data collect interviews/questionnaires use study result . Adult participant tell tell researcher would like withdraw . The researcher agree word sign child participant indicate would like stop take part researcher ask whether would like data use include result study . The researcher continue recruit participant sufficient data qualitative analysis interview . It unlikely study stop prematurely might occur insufficient number participant able recruit one patient sample ( i.e . child diagnosis , parent sibling ) designate time frame .</criteria>
