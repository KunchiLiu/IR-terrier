	<detailed_description>Background The Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) provide care 3.3 million Veterans live rural area , comprise 36 % VHA enrollees . In 1995 , VHA begin expand system Community Based Outpatient Clinics ( CBOCs ) order improve access geographically disperse Veteran population . There approximately 900 CBOCs deliver range service approximately 64 % VHA enrollee . While CBOCs dramatically improve access first class primary care service , challenge deliver specialty mental health care rural Veterans . Evidence base specialty mental care practice develop large VA Medical Centers often feasible deploy small CBOCs thus accessible rural Veterans . Rural Veterans posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) treat CBOCs experience little improvement symptom time . A major contributor poor PTSD outcomes trauma-focused evidence-based psychotherapy provide Veterans CBOC set . Moreover , travel barrier prevent rural Veterans receive trauma-focused evidence-based psychotherapy large VHA Medical Centers ( VAMC ) . Telemedicine Outreach PTSD ( TOP ) technology-facilitated virtual care clinical intervention design enhance access evidence base psychotherapy pharmacotherapy . The VHA Office Rural Health Office Connected Health Telehealth Services intend deploy TOP intervention nationally . This project lay ground work national implementation initiative . Specific Aims Impact Goal - The goal propose Type II Hybrid effectiveness-implementation project support national deployment TOP intervention evaluate clinical effectiveness routine care . To achieve goal , follow three specific aim conduct . Specific Aim 1 - Compare effectiveness standard VA implementation strategy enhance implementation strategy promote uptake TOP . Hypothesis 1 - For site implement TOP successfully standard implementation strategy , randomize enhanced implementation strategy well reach outcomes randomize continued standard VA implementation . Specific Aim 2 - Determine implementation TOP routine care improve PTSD outcomes rural Veterans . Hypothesis 2 - Clinical outcome sit implement TOP successfully improve compare site implement TOP successfully compare pre-implementation period . Hypothesis 3 - Perceived access site implement TOP successfully improve compare site implement TOP successfully compare pre-implementation period . Specific Aim 3 - Calculate cost standard enhance implementation strategy estimate population level cost effectiveness enhance implementation . Methodological Approach Setting - The project conduct 6 VAMCs . CBOCs serve 6 VAMCs without on-site psychologist train trauma-focused evidence-based psychotherapy identify CBOC combination CBOCs 300-400 eligible patient select implementation site ( ) . Population ( evaluation ) - Using administrative data VHA 's Clinical Data Warehouse ( CDW ) , investigator identify patient participate CBOCs whose recent PC-PTSD screen positive , VHA encounter past 12 month PTSD diagnosis , specialty mental health encounter VAMC past 6 month . Eligible patient sample evaluation select CBOCs 100 recruit participate VAMC via opt-out letter . The total anticipated sample size 600 . Participating patient complete baseline survey 3 follow-up survey every 9 month . Local clinician implementation sit flexibility decide eligible receive TOP clinical intervention , investigator expect considerable overlap eligible evaluation consider eligible TOP intervention local clinician . Telemedicine Outreach PTSD ( TOP ) Intervention - TOP deliver virtual care team comprise CBOC provider , telephone care manager , telepsychologist telepsychiatrist locate VAMC . The telephone care manager activity include : education , activation , barrier assessment/resolution , medication adherence side-effect monitoring , therapy/homework adherence monitoring symptom monitoring . The telepsychologist activity include delivery trauma-focused evidence-based therapy ( e.g. , Cognitive Processing Therapy [ CPT ] Prolonged Exposure Therapy [ PE ] ) . The telepsychiatrist activity include conduct case review psychiatric consultation . The core element TOP intervention case review virtual care team ( telephone care manager , telepsychologist telepsychiatrist ) patient newly enrol care management respond treatment , along documentation case review Electronic Health Record . Given dynamic nature technology high degree variability context across clinic , investigator employ method enable new clinical intervention adapt set set refined time rather focus fidelity manualized protocol . The telepsychiatry telepsychology either delivered via interactive video CBOC via clinical video telehealth home . The Veteran telepsychologist choose use smartphone apps ( CPT Coach PE Coach ) design augment two trauma-focused evidence-based therapy . Care manager also use secure messaging patient addition telephone call . Standard VA Implementation Strategy - Standard VA implementation strategy include disseminate TOP clinical intervention manual , TOP local champion guide , care manager training material , PTSD case-finder tool ( inclusion/exclusion criterion use evaluation sample ) , technical support facility level telehealth technician . Internal facilitation conduct designated local champion . In addition , VAMC receive fund Office Rural Health hire full time telephone care manager three year devote manage CBOC patient mental health disorder include PTSD . Enhanced VA Implementation Strategy - The enhanced implementation strategy add external facilitation standard VA implementation strategy . External facilitation begin assessment current workflow VHA Medical Center affiliate CBOCs use System Redesign method . A member external facilitation team conduct site visit VAMC conduct telephone interview CBOC staff . The member external facilitation team also collaborate local System Redesign staff member . To assess clinical workflow , investigator examine administrative structure clinical unit , staff pattern , scope practice , service mix , standard operating procedure ( e.g. , patient check-in , screening , referral , cod ) , job description annual evaluation criterion , use technology include telehealth , eHealth , mHealth , electronic health record . For TOP intervention , key clinical workflow element include : 1 ) patient refer care manager , 2 ) whether care manager locate VISN , VAMC CBOC administrative unit house , 3 ) type psychotherapy provide CBOC ( e.g. , anger management , PTSD group , etc . ) , 4 ) formulary restriction prescribe pattern , 5 ) psychiatric consultation arrange , 6 ) frequently patient see mental health primary care , caseloads , wait time , 7 ) appointment schedule procedure mental health primary care , 8 ) show rate , 9 ) care manager software availability , 10 ) use interactive video , clinical video telehealth home , SmartPhone apps , 10 ) use psychiatric rating scale , 11 ) workload credit distribute . The external facilitation team generate clinical workflow chart describe current process care . With advice external facilitation team , local champion incorporate clinical process TOP intervention ( include use technology ) current clinical workflow chart , make change TOP intervention and/or current clinical workflow need . The local champion also meet monthly external facilitator troubleshoot make refinement . Project Design - A stepped wedge Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ( SMART ) design use Type II Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation project . The project compare implementation outcome ( patient reach ) standard VA implementation strategy implementation outcomes enhanced implementation strategy . This design also allow u document improvement perceive access PTSD outcomes patient sit successfully implement TOP intervention . The investigator begin collect pre-implementation access outcome data sample patient . In first implementation step , six VAMCs conduct standard VA implementation strategy select CBOCs nine month . At end first implementation step , collect follow-up data sample patient assess perceived access , intervention reach , clinical effectiveness . To conduct SMART trial design necessary specify performance measure benchmark ( i.e. , tailor variable ) use determine whether standard implementation effort successful . The investigator define implementation success base capacity full time care manager enroll prespecified number patient . Specifically , care manager report number patient enrol care management protocol evaluation team implementation success define 50 enrolled patient 9 month period . If performance measure benchmark attain , VAMC discontinue standard VA implementation effort , investigator continue collect evaluation data . If performance measure benchmark attain , VAMC randomize either continued standard VA implementation strategy enhance implementation strategy next step . In second implementation step , VAMCs conduct either standard enhanced implementation strategy select CBOCs nine month . At end second implementation step , investigator collect follow-up data sample patient assess perceived access , intervention reach , clinical effectiveness . If performance measure benchmark attain second step standard enhance implementation site , VAMC discontinue implementation effort . If performance measure benchmark attain standard implementation site , VAMC receive enhance implementation strategy next step . If performance measure benchmark attain enhanced implementation site , VAMC continue receive enhanced implementation . At end third implementation step , investigator collect follow-up data sample patient assess perceived access , intervention reach , clinical effectiveness . Outcome Measures - The evaluation implementation strategy base RE-AIM framework . Data collect patient survey chart review patient sampled evaluation . The reach implementation outcome measure specify proportion sample patient receive core element TOP intervention ( documentation electronic health record case review patient virtual care team ) . This assessed chart review three time point : 1 ) 9 month follow-up , 2 ) 20 month follow-up , 3 ) 31 month follow-up . For patient sample , perceive access clinical effectiveness data collect four different time point : 1 ) pre-implementation baseline , 2 ) 9 month follow-up , 3 ) 20 month follow-up , 4 ) 31 month follow-up . PTSD outcomes specify continuous change PCL-5 score baseline follow-up . Perceived access measure use item specifically develop project . Provider adoption assess qualitative interview CBOC clinician treat sample patient well member TOP intervention team ( i.e. , care manager , telepsychiatrists telepsychologists ) local champion . During qualitative interview CBOC VAMC provider , investigator also assess barrier facilitator adoption , include perceive benefit weakness TOP intervention . Costs - The investigator measure cost implementation strategy prospectively retrospectively . The investigator collect data implementation activity standard VA enhance implementation strategy . These cost activity assess investigator ' operational partner , local champion , external facilitator , well personnel implementation sit VISN , VAMC , CBOCs . The investigator first examine component implementation strategy identify activity component . These activity include clinical workflow mapping , development training material , training session , meeting , conference call . The investigator develop project logs document activity time spend activity . The external facilitator , local champion frontline provider implementation team record log regular basis . The investigator review meet conference call minute document time spend attendance facilitation team , operational partner clinical leader frontline provider . TOP intervention cost assess CDW ( use provider IDs identify TOP encounter ) . Data Analysis - The stepped wedge SMART design allow u estimate effectiveness implementation strategy compare patient reach group VAMCs randomize standard enhance implementation compare reach outcome time within VAMC transition standard implementation enhance implementation . Likewise , collect PCL-5 score pre-baseline throughout implementation step , investigator able compare access PTSD outcomes patient VAMCs successfully implement TOP successfully implement TOP compare access PTSD outcomes time within VAMC transition pre-implementation successful implementation . This allow u estimate clinical effectiveness TOP promising practice implement routine care . Following intent treat principal , investigator estimate clinical effectiveness TOP entire sample regardless whether reach generate measure population level effectiveness . Generalized linear model use account cluster patient provider within VAMCs CBOCs . VAMCs CBOCs specify random effect time period specify fixed effect . The reach , access PTSD outcome regression estimate use patient unit analysis data VAMCs include regardless whether VAMC attain performance measure benchmark . For hypothesis 1 ( reach regression ) , explanatory variable whether VAMC randomize standard VA implementation enhance implementation step . For hypothesis 2 ( PTSD outcomes regression ) 3 ( access regression ) , explanatory variable whether VAMC attain performance measure benchmark time period . Using implementation intervention cost data , investigator also calculate population level cost-effectiveness use enhanced implementation strategy deploy TOP promising practice relative standard VA implementation strategy .</detailed_description>
