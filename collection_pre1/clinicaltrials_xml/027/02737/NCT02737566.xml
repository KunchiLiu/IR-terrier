	<brief_summary>The primary objective study 1 ) evaluate longer-term impact adjunctive , low-cost financial incentive intervention ( relative standard care ) smoking abstinence rate among socioeconomically disadvantage individual participate clinic-based smoking cessation program 2 ) identify treatment mechanism contextual factor associate cessation outcome among intervention participant use traditional ecological momentary assessment approach . Those randomized financial incentive intervention opportunity earn small gift card biochemically-verified abstinence 12 week post-quit . We hypothesize individual randomly assign adjunctive CM intervention significantly high rate biochemically-verified abstinence 26-week post-quit follow-up assign Usual Care . In addition , hypothesize several factor related socioeconomic disadvantage directly associate non-abstinence , especially great stress/adversity , limited psychosocial resource , great negative affect , great nicotine dependence , poorer treatment adherence . The primary study endpoint include self-reported tobacco use/abstinence , expire carbon monoxide ( CO ) level ( i.e. , amount carbon monoxide present individual 's breath breathe ) , saliva cotinine level 26 week post-quit attempt , though smoking status assess visit . Traditional questionnaire measurement ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) utilized measure potential treatment mechanism include motivation , self-efficacy , treatment adherence . Other variable include stress/adversity , psychosocial resource , negative affect , nicotine dependence , treatment adherence also assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals ( N = 320 ) recruit initial visit Tobacco Cessation Clinic . Eligible participant ( N = 320 ) randomize : 1 ) Standard Care , counsel pharmacological treatment ( SC ; n = 160 ) , 2 ) SC + adjunctive financial incentive 12 week post-quit ( CM ; n = 160 ) . All participant follow weekly 1 week pre-quit 4 week post-quit , return visit 8 , 12 , 26 week post-quit . Biochemically verify 7-day point prevalence abstinence assess visit , though abstinence 26 week post-quit ( longer-term abstinence ) serve primary outcome variable . Those randomized CM intervention opportunity earn small gift card biochemically-verified abstinence 12 week post-quit . The value gift card escalate weekly continuous abstinence quit date 4 week post-quit . Additional gift card abstinence may earn 8 12 week post-quit . We also hope gain good understand CM treatment mechanism identify factor directly influence cessation via traditional questionnaire smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approach . Smartphone technology allow `` real-time '' data collection accurately capture important cessation-related variable , use deliver gain-framed message support strengthen CM intervention . Participants complete traditional questionnaire measure laptop computer weekly 1 week pre-quit 4 week post-quit , 8 , 12 , 26 week post-quit . Assessments complete participant either counsel appointment , receive reimbursement form gift card . Participants also receive smartphone 1 week pre-quit visit ask carry time 4 week post-quit order complete EMAs ( 5 week total ) .
