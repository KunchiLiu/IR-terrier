	<detailed_description>This description focus randomize , control trial evaluate effectiveness web-based prevention intervention investigator develop . Recruitment . Youth recruit study participation via banner video ad , well homepage ad 'YouTube . ' Youth also recruit banner video ad classify advertise website , 'Craigslist , ' banner ad social networking website , 'Tumblr . ' These site allow advertiser choose demographic audience ad target . This lead significantly few click ad advertising site user meet inclusionary criterion study . The investigator plan post banner ad promote study 12-17 year old live U.S. To increase credibility , investigator ensure ad reference organization involve research project fund source . The investigator anticipate run ad 3 month obtain adequate sample size 400 study . Screening Enrollment . Upon click study ad , individual take study website present brief introduction study anonymous screener . Individuals eligible decline participation ask indicate reason non-interest . Persons click ad ineligible decline participation provide link National Institute Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) 'PEERx ' teen website ( teens.drugabuse.gov/peerx ) . The investigator employ several procedure ensure prospective participant indeed youth within targeted sample . All prospective participant ask complete electronic form participant parent ' name , address phone number . An information packet mail parent , include letter describe study brief summary parent receive packet , 2 copy consent/assent form , investigator ' contact information ( include toll-free number ) , request participant 's email address phone number , self-addressed , stamp envelope return 1 sign copy consent/assent . To verify parental consent receive , research team member call parent confirm child 's participation . A research team member also visually inspect parent ' child 's signature consent/assent form , suspiciously similar lead non-enrollment . Youth provide appropriate consents/assents email unique study identification ( ID ) temporary password use study 's secure website . During initial login , participant require change password . Participants invite complete baseline assessment online . As validity check , participant ask Date Birth twice baseline . If individual provide discrepant date , s/he invite move forward randomization refer National Institute Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) teen website . Randomization Study Conditions . Minimum likelihood allocation use randomize participant , stratification race ( Caucasian vs. Other ) , give disproportionately high rate prescription opioid misuse among Caucasian youth . Youth control group inform prompt next online survey available complete . Participants assign web-based intervention immediately ( post-group assignment ) ask start completing module . Youth encourage complete 1-2 module per login , 2x/week ( 30 min . minimum per login ) . The core module content web-based intervention follow : What Prescription Opioids ? Misconception Prescription Opioids Safe Non-addictive , Misconception Using Prescription Opioids Without Prescription Not Illegal , Risks Prescription Opioid Misuse , Non-medication Alternatives Pain Management , Refusing Offers Misuse Prescription Opioids , Refusing Requests From Others Prescription Opioid Prescribed You , How Know You Someone You Know May Addicted . Data collect . Assessment data obtain : Baseline , post-intervention , 3- 6-month post- intervention follow-up ( comparable time-points control ) . If result promise , long follow-up may incorporate future research project allow long evaluation period Phase II grant mechanism . Participants experimental arm ask complete post-intervention assessment immediately complete module . Consistent intent-to-treat analysis , participant complete module within 4-week period still provide opportunity complete post- intervention assessment 4-weeks post-group assignment complete follow-up . The investigator plan collect follow data addition data capture primary secondary outcome measure ( described section ) : basic demographic information ; substance use information ; feedback survey data ( post-intervention time point ) ; assessment usage data ( e.g. , number time module access , duration usage module , time quiz mastery within module , extent module completion ) . Participants complete assessment online ( secure manner ; see protection risk ) . Analysis . Although random assignment design account baseline difference , group compare difference demographic characteristic use analysis variance continuous variable , Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests non-normal variable chi-square test categorical measure . If specific characteristic predictive outcome , consider potential covariate subsequent analyse use mixed-effects analysis covariance . Primary analysis include participant randomize study condition independent early dropout , consistent intent-to-treat approach clinical trial . The investigator also compare demographic baseline characteristic complete study . Analyses perform use 'SAS ' statistical software ( type I error =.05 ) . Given pervasive misconception many youth understanding risk associate prescription opioid misuse , investigator primarily focus analysis knowledge prescription opioid misuse well measure highly predictive future use ( attitude , intention , skill perceive risk ) . Actual rate use secondary focus , plan evaluation window primary prevention trial primarily focus recruit promote behavior change among select sample youth misuse prescription opioids baseline . The investigator able assess web-based program result low rate use 6 month post-intervention . Outcome measure evaluate separate analysis . Data primary outcome evaluate use mixed-effects analysis ' ( SAS , PROC MIXED ) , ' allow incomplete data covariance structure compound symmetry . In addition study condition indicator , model include , fixed effect portion model , main effect time well two-way interaction study condition time . The key estimate model two-way interaction effect , indicate whether change outcome ( e.g. , knowledge ) time different two condition . Protection Against Risk . During trial , web-based intervention online assessment tool accessible participant password protection encrypt Internet connection via 128-bit ( 256-bit available ) Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) , e-commerce industry standard secure communication World Wide Web . The server house web-based prevention program protect behind two firewall physically secure locked cabinet . Administrative access ( e.g. , Server Administrator ) machine occur use secure shell ( SSH ) , secure , encrypt protocol remotely connect machine . Servers back nightly external hard drive use encrypt file system . Additionally , offsite back-up process encrypts critical data ( use 'FIPS ' 140-2 certified encryption algorithm ) upload data private , secure Amazon S3 bucket ( generic `` cloud computing '' storage service offer Amazon ) . All data provide participant use interactive prevention program ( e.g. , complete quizzes test learning ) complete online assessment transmit via encrypt 'SSL ' secure server accessible anyone affiliate research project . Consistent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) , investigator store personally identifiable data separately data obtain participant . To accomplish , two application create . The first application store ( limited ) personally identifiable data plan obtained participant , include participant email address , participant username/password , participant parent name/parent contact info ( purpose Informed Consent ) participant date birth ( part plan age verification check ) . This `` personal '' application also store unique ID string consist 32 randomly generate character , would pass back forth application application store non-personally identifiable data ( `` anonymous data '' ) . The `` anonymous data '' application store bulk data collect participant ( data online assessment well data participant ' usage web-based intervention ) knowledge user ' personal information communicate personal data application strict set Application Programming Interfaces ( APIs ) . This approach ensure personally identifiable data data collect participant never store together . Emails sent youth prompt access program complete assessment contain identifiable information reference substance abuse confidential sensitive issue . Participants participant parent/legal guardian explicitly inform participant 's sensitive data handle Informed Consent form . To protect participant confidentiality , Certificate Confidentiality National Institute Drug Abuse obtain .</detailed_description>
