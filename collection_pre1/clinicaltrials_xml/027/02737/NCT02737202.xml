	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Saracatinib In Subjects With Lymphangioleiomyomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) autosomal dominant disorder cause mutation tuberous sclerosis complex 1 ( TSC1 ) TSC2 tumor suppressor gene . TSC characterize tumor wide range tissue , seizure , mental retardation , autism , organ failure . Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) , major pulmonary manifestation woman TSC , progressive lung disease characterize infiltration atypical smooth muscle like cell ( TSC-/- LAM cell ) formation parenchymal cyst . Sporadic LAM develop woman meet criterion diagnosis TSC , owe somatic mutation TSC2 gene . The long term goal research devise novel therapeutic strategy patient LAM . The observed behavior LAM cell respect infiltrative growth pattern , metastatic potential , alter cell differentiation reminiscent cell undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Src kinases key regulator cellular proliferation , motility , invasiveness EMT . Recent result show autophagy promotes degradation active Src . Thereby , decrease autophagy due mTOR activation know occur LAM cell , may play significant role accumulation active Src cell . Src suppress transcription E-cadherin upregulating transcriptional repressor . The preliminary data reveal increase active Src lung tissue patient LAM well culture TSC2-/- cell . Further , TSC2-/- cell , E-cadherin considerably reduce localize plasma membrane , wild-type cell . The focus study examine Src inhibition represent potential therapeutic strategy LAM . It propose Src activation TSC2-/- cell result reduction E-cadherin , loss cell-cell adhesion elevation oncogenic metastatic potential cell . The increased Src activity TSC2-/- cell likely cause inhibition autophagy associate hyper-activation mTOR . Therefore , use Src inhibitor may lead reduction tumor growth prevent dissemination TSC2-/- cell . In study , investigator evaluate safety efficacy Src inhibition subject LAM . A number inhibitor Src clinical trial patient range different tumor . Dasatinib , oral adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -competitive Src inhibitor , approve clinical use patient chronic myeloid leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia . However , dasatinib wider 'off target ' inhibitory activity saracatinib include potent activity Abl , ephrin receptor kinase , platelet-derived growth factor receptor c-KIT ( type receptor tyrosine kinase type tumor marker . Also call CD117 stem cell factor receptor . ) In contrast , saracatinib &gt; 10-fold preference Src Abl kinases little activity tyrosine serine/threonine kinase . Saracatinib already characterize multiple clinical trial term safety pharmacokinetics . The investigator conduct Phase1b study test safety various dos Saracatinib LAM subject . The purpose Phase1b trial determine optimal dose term safety tolerability LAM population . Three escalate dos saracatinib ; 50 , 125 175 mg study . Saracatinib give orally day . Overall , subject tolerate Saracatinib well . The investigator choose dose 125 mg conduct test safety efficacy Phase 2a trial .</detailed_description>
