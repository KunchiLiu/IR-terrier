	<brief_summary>40 Egyptian Cases split-thickness skin graft receive treatment Zagazig University Hospitals . Study Duration:6 Months .Description Agent Moist Exposed Burn Ointment ( MEBO ) . Intervention : Objectives : Primary : determine efficacy MEBO versus standard care improve heal speed re-epithelization process skin graft donor recipient site . Secondary determine efficacy MEBO decrease recovery time , rate infection , rate complication , total treatment cost effect improve pain alleviation . Description Study Design : Arm 1 20 MEBO site donor graft recipient time operation dress Arm 2 20 Standard cream Zagazig University Hospital ( Antibiotics &amp; analgesic ) Estimated Time Complete 5 month</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Mebo Dressing Versus Standard Care Managing Donor Recipient Sites Split-thickness Skin Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Information . Skin graft frequently use technique cover skin defect case row area . The technique evolve use back alleys India pre-Christian time become one valuable clinical tool modern surgery . There several technique care skin graft site assure adequate graft prompt well wound heal . The use split-thickness skin graft ( STSG ) reconstructive technique common nowadays technique usually source pain discomfort patient may cause significant morbidity result hypertrophic even keloid scar . The wound heals process re-epithelialization result epithelial cover usually within 7-14 day . The aim graft management maintain environment promote optimal heal prevents morbidity , include pain infection ultimately delay healing . The dress donor recipient site provide protective barrier easy apply , promote rapid re-epithelialization , pain free , infection free , relatively inexpensive . MEBO prove anti-inflammatory anti-microbial effect due presence - Î² sitosterol berberine respectively . Many study report MEBO provide suitable moist environment need burn wound optimal heal re-epithelialization without need wound closure dress . Also study prove efficacy MEBO secondary heal partial thickness wound , split thickness skin graft site , improve cosmetic result well scar quality . In case raw area , donor recipient site traditionally dress low-adherent wound contact paraffin gauze antibiotic-impregnated tulle gras cover secondary dressing make gauze absorbent padding . These dressing relatively inexpensive . However , peri-operative period , patient complain often discomfort pain donor area graft site besides , poor cosmetic appearance donor sit heal readily accept . Because basic pathology burn closely mimic many aspect skin graft donor site , researcher investigate use MEBO donor recipient site . Potential Risks Due pure natural origin , MEBO report side effect potential risk except rare case allergy hypersensitivity . Known Potential Benefits MEBO prove positive effect improve heal process rapid re-epithelialization . According recent study , burn area graft site markedly less hyperemic less pigmented final cosmetic appearance patient satisfaction also higher use MEBO . The case use MEBO well scar assessment low pain scale .</detailed_description>
