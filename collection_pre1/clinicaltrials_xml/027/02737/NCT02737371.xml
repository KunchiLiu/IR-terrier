	<brief_title>Multiple Ascending Oral Dose Study F901318 Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male female healthy subject conform selection criterion invite take part study . Screening visit ( Visit 1 ) After give fully inform , write consent , subject attend clinic . Subjects undergo screen within 28 day prior first dose administration . Prior screen visit , subject : - Refrain vigorous exercise 7 day - Abstain alcohol 48 hour - Subjects sign consent form presence CRU physician prior screen procedure perform . The information record subject , regardless suitability study , retain archive . The following information procedure record performed part screen assessment : - Medical history - Ethnic origin , sex , age , height , weight , BMI - Vital sign : supine blood pressure , supine pulse rate , oral body temperature - Resting 12 lead ECG - Physical examination - Urine drug abuse screen , cotinine alcohol breath test - Pregnancy test , must negative - Fasting clinical laboratory serology investigation - All female ask give approximate date last menstrual period . - Ophthalmological assessment ( Performed second screen visit subject show first screen visit meet eligibility criterion study ) Up 28 day screen , subject attend clinic . Subjects admit research unit approximately 09:00 hour morning day dose ( Day -1 ) . Urine subject screen drug abuse detection substance disqualify subject study . A physical examination , check inclusion/exclusion criterion , clinical laboratory evaluation , pregnancy test relevant must negative , oral temperature body weight perform . Subjects ask whether experienced adverse event take concomitant medication since previous visit . Supper serve start approximately 19.30 hour snack approximately 21.00 hour fast overnight 4 hour post dose . Water allow ad libitum throughout . On Day 1 , total first urine void morning subject collect polyethylene container , , sample take urinalysis pre-dose / baseline F901318 concentration . Within one hour dosing commences ( 1 hour ) , blood drawn laboratory safety assessment ( haematology clinical chemistry ) , pre-dose baseline F901318 metabolites concentration . Supine stand blood pressure pulse rate duplicate , body temperature 12-lead ECG record . The subject also connect continuous ECG record -1 hour ) least 12 hour start dose . Subjects ask whether experienced adverse event overnight . Any concomitant medication record . Subjects dose . This oral suspension wash 250 mL phosphate buffer . Subjects dose regular interval subject . After dose , follow measurement observation obtain : - Blood sample analysis F901318 plasma concentration drawn 15min , 30 min , 45min , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 16 hour dose Day 1 . - On Days 2 9 , pharmacokinetic blood sample draw within 15 minute prior dose 2 4 hour later . - On Day 10 , blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis drawn within 15 minute commencement dose 15min , 30 min , 45min,1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 , 96 120 hour follow dosing . - Pharmacokinetic blood sample analyse review dose escalation . After first dose level administration , dose level time blood sample may adjust subsequent dose escalation . The basis decision depend upon pharmacokinetic profile obtain precede group subject . All change document file note . The number sample volume blood drawn must increase without prior approval relevant ethic committee . - If appear Cmax may exceed stop criterion , daily dose cohort divide two half give 6-12 hour apart exception Day 10 single morning half dose give . The change make basis pharmacokinetic prediction use data obtain previous cohort . In case , blood urine sample time adjust accordingly documented note file . The number blood sample draw pharmacokinetics exceed 68 without approval relevant ethic committee . - Blood sample draw metabolite measurement 4 8 hour morning dose Day 1 within 15 minute prior 4 8 hour dose Day 10 . - Blood collect safety measurement ( haematology clinical chemistry ) urine sample obtain urinalysis Days 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 9 15 minute prior morning dose 24 , 48 72 hour dose Day 10 . - Complete urine collection analysis F901318 urine concentration make follow interval relation dosing : 0-4 , 4-8 , 8-12 , 12-24 hour Day 1 0-4 , 4-8 , 8-12 , 12-16 , 16-24 , 24-48 , 48-72 , 72-96 96-120 hour dose Day 10 . - Supine stand pulse rate blood pressure body temperature ( vital sign ) record 30 , 60 120 minute , 4 , 8 12 hour dose Day 1 , prior ( within 30 minute ) dose Days 2 - 10 4 hour dose Days 2 - 10 . - Twelve-lead ECGs obtain 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 hour dose Day 1 within 30 minute 4 hour dose Days 3 , 6 10 . - The continuous ECG record cease 12 hour dose Day 1 . It may extend 24 hour discretion PI . A continuous recording obtain one hour prior 12 hour dose Day 10 . It also may extend 24 hour discretion PI . - Spontaneously report adverse event concomitant medication note throughout . - Lunch serve approximately 4 hour morning dose 4 hour observation blood sample complete main meal serve approximately 8 hour snack approximately 11.5 hour morning dose . - Ophthalmological evaluation conduct 24 hour post Day 10 dosing ( +/- 4 hour ) - A pregnancy test perform Day 15 female child bear potential . Subjects may leave Research Unit Day 15 , unless experienced adverse event , opinion Investigator , warrant observation and/or treatment . All subject follow 8-10 day last dose study drug post-study visit .</detailed_description>
