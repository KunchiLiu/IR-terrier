	<brief_title>ALTA-1L Study : A Phase 3 Study Brigatinib Versus Crizotinib ALK-positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose phase III , randomize , open-label , comparative , multicenter , international study compare efficacy safety brigatinib crizotinib anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) -positive locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient previously treat ALK inhibitor . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio receive either brigatinib , 90 milligram ( mg ) orally daily ( QD ) 7 day , 180 mg orally QD , crizotinib , 250 mg orally twice daily ( BID ) . Participants receive treatment disease progression , intolerable toxicity , consent withdrawal , death . The total estimated duration study least 5 year , include 2 year accrue patient , least 3 year treatment follow-up .</detailed_description>
