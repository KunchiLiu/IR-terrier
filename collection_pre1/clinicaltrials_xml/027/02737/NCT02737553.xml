	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic tissue removal one challenging part laparoscopic surgery . For reason , electromechanical morcellation long used facilitate tissue removal gynecology . However , electromechanical morcellation long perform inside abdomen without containment . Therefore , practice recently undergo increase scrutiny important concern related tissue dissemination intracorporeal power morcellation . Thus , US Food Drug Administration release safety communication discourage power morcellation laparoscopic hysterectomy myomectomy procedure April 2014 . As result serious concern , enclose laparoscopic power morcellation come prominence gynecological surgery . Besides removal tissue vagina posterior colpotomy consider another solution critical problem . In literature comparison two technique tissue removal considerably scarce . Therefore researcher aim prepare trial compare laparoscopic enclose electromechanical morcellation tissue removal thorough vagina posterior colpotomy accord surgical time , postoperative pain postoperative sexual function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Enclosed Morcellation ; Electromechanic Morcellation v Vaginal Removal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study researcher aim compare compare laparoscopic enclose electromechanical morcellation tissue removal thorough vagina posterior colpotomy accord surgical time , postoperative pain postoperative sexual function . Patients indication myomectomy , 18 40 year old , without prior abdominal surgery without suspicious malignancy include study . Anticipated number patient 60 . Participants randomize two group ; group 1 enclose electromechanical morcellation perform remove myoma abdominal cavity ; group 2 myoma remove vagina posterior colpotomy . In group 1 , extirpation myoma uterus repair uterine defect , myoma remove abdomen enclose laparoscopic electromechanical morcellation use surgical glove . In group 2 , extirpation myoma uterus repair uterine defect , myoma remove vagina posterior colpotomy . In group myoma also remove enclosed fashion use endo bag . Tissue removal time ( group 1 removal time decide time insertion removal morcellation , group two removal time decide time start posterior colpotomy end closure posterior colpotomy ) , postoperative time sexual function patient complication compare . Visual pain score female sexual function index questionnaire use assess postoperative pain sexual function , respectively .</detailed_description>
