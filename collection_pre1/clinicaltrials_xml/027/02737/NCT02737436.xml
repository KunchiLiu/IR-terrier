	<detailed_description>The investigator plan conduct fMRI scan group mother blindly randomly assign either intranasal oxytocin placebo . The purpose investigation explore neuroendocrine experiential factor contribute problem parental neglect , examine oxytocin may modify early maternal brain behavioral response infant cue . In addition , investigator examine sex difference parental brain behavioral response oxytocin also recruit male partner enrol mother participate similar protocol . Aim 1 : To determine whether intranasal oxytocin ( IN-OT ) affect parental brain response infant cue , measure functional MRI ( fMRI ) scanning . Hypothesis 1 ( ) : Compared placebo , mother receive intranasal oxytocin show great activation mesocorticolimbic dopamine reward region brain , include ventral striatum medial prefrontal cortex , view vs. unknown infant face fMRI scan . Hypothesis 1 ( ii ) : Compared placebo , father show great activation social-cognitive circuit , include dorsal prefrontal cortex ( dPFC ) . Aim 2 : To determine whether IN-OT affect parental behavioral response infant cue , measure videotape parent-infant interaction procedure . Hypothesis 2 ( ) : Compared placebo , parent receive intranasal oxytocin score high overall measure maternal sensitivity , free play parent-infant interaction procedure ( CARE-Index ) . Hypothesis 2 ( ii ) : Compared placebo , mother receive intranasal oxytocin demonstrate frequent emotionally contingent response infant recovery phase modify Still-Face procedure . Aim 3 : To determine whether attachment security interacts effect IN-OT maternal brain behavioral response infant cue . Hypothesis 3 ( ) : Compared secure ( Type B ) mother , mother insecure/dismissing ( Type A ) attachment great brain behavioral response IN-OT ( describe Hypotheses 1 2 ) , 2-way interaction effect see treatment attachment group . Hypothesis 3 ( ii ) : Compared Type B mother , mother insecure/preoccupied ( Type C ) attachment reduce brain behavioral response IN-OT ( describe Hypotheses 1 2 ) , 2-way interaction effect see treatment attachment group . Aim 4 : To determine whether brain reward activation associate indirect measure emotional neglect mother . Hypothesis 4 ( ) : Maternal brain reward system activation , without IN-OT , positively correlate 1 ) maternal sensitivity ( measure CARE-Index ) , 2 ) contingency maternal response infant behavioral cue . Initial enrollment : Recruitment occur postpartum period . At time contact information patient chart Texas Children 's Hospital system EPIC database , collect follow-up contact . In addition recruiting EPIC , investigator plan execute recruiting measure form advertising . Parent ( ) recruit via newspaper , internet , public posting , mass mailing . All internet , newspaper , public posting , mass mailing require parent ( ) directly contact study order participate . Once eligibility confirm , subject schedule study visit inform confidentiality consent participate study activity . Visit 1 : 4 Months Post-Partum - Adult Attachment Interview ( AAI ) . During visit , enrol woman participate modify version Adult Attachment Interview ( AAI ) , semi-structured 1Â½-2 hour-long interview involve specified question follow-up inquiry relate childhood relationship attachment figure . The attachment classification reveal third party group balance order oxytocin placebo administer , base attachment group . The investigator also collect sociodemographic , breastfeed data , screen information depression . The EPDS repeat subsequent visit order calculate mean score . Visits 2A &amp; B 3A &amp; B : Intranasal Oxytocin v . Placebo Administration In double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled trial intranasal oxytocin , maternal brain behavioral response infant cue assess within &amp; subject . Each participant administer active ( oxytocin ) inactive ( placebo ) nasal spray prior separate behavioral fMRI scan session , order administration balance across subject attachment group . All involve blind identity oxytocin placebo spray . Before visit , parent ( ) ask abstain tobacco , food drink ( except water ) least 2 hour prior visit . The investigator attempt schedule visit latter half mother 's menstrual cycle , minimize potential confounding fluctuation estrogen level . Mothers without regular menstrual cycle schedule one month apart . Mothers still breastfeed ask feed infant least one hour prior visit . For four visit involve intranasal drug administration ( two behavioral test visit two fMRI scan visit ) , follow protocol apply : participant give urinary pregnancy test prior start visit . If mother test positive , exclude study due theoretical concern possible effect oxytocin uterine contraction . Due fact pregnancy test may still detect early pregnancy , mother also ask abstain unprotected sexual intercourse 2 week prior visit , confirm , sign consent form , substantial chance current pregnancy . Just prior drug administration , parent ( ) complete Positive Negative Affect Scale , rate current emotion , comparison post-spray . The parent ( ) self-administer dose either oxytocin ( 3 puff per nostril [ 4 IU per puff ] = 24 IU total ) placebo spray contain inactive ingredient oxytocin solution . Both experimenter subject blind treatment receiving . A stopwatch start moment subject begin intranasal administration , behavior assessment fMRI scan begin exactly 50 minute later . Most study intranasal oxytocin use 50 minute delay time , base CSF study intranasally administer neuropeptides , analogous hormone vasopressin . Forty minute drug administration , PANAS repeat . Visits 2A &amp; B : 5-6 Months Postpartum - Behavioral Response 1 . On arrival , parent ( ) infant escort behavioral observation room Clinical Nutrition Research Center , infant introduce developmentally appropriate toy . Questionnaires complete home reviewed ( Infant Behavior Questionnaire [ IBQ ] , Parenting Stress Index [ PSI ] demographic breastfeed questionnaire ) , incomplete complete time . 2 . Each parent self-administer nasal spray , previously randomize investigational pharmacy either oxytocin placebo . During follow wait period , Bayley Scales Infant Development screener complete infant , exclude developmental delay area fine motor , gross motor , language social development . This perform research associate train use standardized tool . 3 . Fifty minute nasal spray administer , parent rejoin infant participate videotape `` free play '' interaction floor 3 minute ( describe ) . The recording later cod dyadic interaction use 14-point sensitivity scale CARE-Index . 4 . A modified still-face procedure conduct next 3 minute ( describe ) . 5 . The parent ( ) take another area building , infant videotape obtain face image use subsequent scan visit . During brief separation period , infant secure mounted car seat , videotape use age appropriate toy elicit smile ( neutral ) facial expression . This last 10 minute . The parent ( ) observe videotape ensure infant face image novel present subsequent visit . Crying face also elicit , necessary , briefly leave infant alone room , secured car seat , video recorder run . The infant observe time behind one-way mirror , leave cry around 35-40 second . Infant cry also record time . 6 . Infant face image various degree affect-happy , neutral sad-will extract digital video recording , use subsequent fMRI procedure ( Visit 3 ) . The image standardize size , orientation background use Adobe Photoshop . All face image rat degree affect use 5-point adaptation Self-Assessment Manikin ( SAM ) , categorize image one five affect group : happy , happy , neutral , sad sad . These face match age , sex , ethnicity degree affect large database `` unknown '' infant face , collect previous K23 study . 7 . Approximately one month later , comparable time menstrual cycle , basic procedure repeat subject , except receive intranasal oxytocin give placebo , vice versa . Visit 3A &amp; B : 8-9 Months Postpartum - Brain Response 1 . Three month first behavioral response session , parent attend two scanning session Human Neuroimaging Laboratory , Baylor College Medicine . Intranasal oxytocin placebo administer describe . Infant face image Visit 3A used Visit 4A scan session , Visit 3B 4B , ensure repeat scan session use comparable unique face image . The image session match degree facial affect . Prior intranasal drug administration first scan visit , parent ( ) complete Positive Negative Affect States ( PANAS ) questionnaire . 2 . During wait period , parent ( ) complete questionnaire . 3 . Fifty minute administration nasal spray , parent ( ) participate functional MRI scanning session , passively view series unique infant face image hear cry infant unknown infant . Each parent inform `` brain activity monitor use functional MRI participant show picture baby '' within-scanner eye track tool also utilized evaluate effect oxytocin gaze preference face region , ensure attention visual stimulus . Using event-related fMRI design , randomly present image view 2 second , random inter-stimulus interval 2 , 4 6 second ( Fig 3 ) . The 60 image equally divide 3 affect group - happy , neutral sad , intensity happy sad affect balance `` '' `` unknown '' face . The order image 6 group ( OH , ON , OS , UH , UN , US ) pseudo-randomized within run , subject . 4 . All imaging perform use 3 Tesla Siemens MRI scanner . Visual image generate use computer control LCD projector , present parent ( ) via overhead mirror display . Regional brain activation assess measuring change blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI signal ( BOLD-fMRI ) . 5 . Subjects participate single whole-brain functional run around 185 scan . 6 . High-resolution T1-weighted structural image acquire . Raw process fMRI anatomic data also archive hard drive associate Linux workstation back duplicate DVD . 7 . After scan session , parent ask rate infant face image think infant feeling , well feeling pleasure arousal , use adaptation Self-Assessment Manikin . b . After parent ( ) complete questionnaire , 2 4 randomly select module Bayley Scales Infant Development screener complete infant . This perform research associate train use standardized tool . c. The parent ( ) rejoin infant participate videotape `` free play '' interaction floor 3 minute . The recording later cod dyadic interaction use 14-point sensitivity scale CARE-Index . Husbands participant also biological father infant invite join study one CARE-Index visit ( receive either oxytocin placebo ) 2 fMRI scan ( receive oxytocin placebo ) .</detailed_description>
