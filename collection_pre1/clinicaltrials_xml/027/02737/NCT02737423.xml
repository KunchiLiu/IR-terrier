	<brief_summary>The main objective study assess effect vitamin D treatment painful diabetic neuropathy Pakistan . This prospective study diabetic patient DN score ≥ 4 , administer single dose 600,000 IU Vitamin D. All diabetic patient ( type 1 type 2 ) screen visit consider eligible participate study . The change painful diabetic neuropathy score assess use DN4 Neuropathic Pain Diagnostic Questionnaire SF - MPQ participant visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Painful diabetic neuropathy ( DPN ) common patient long-standing diabetes mellitus . The prevalence neuropathy approach 50 % diabetes 25 year . Among patient neuropathy , 11.6 % type 1 diabetes 32.1 % type 2 diabetes neuropathic pain . In recent observational study large cohort diabetic patient primary care northwest England ( n = 15,692 ) , painful diabetic neuropathy ( PDN ) , assess use neuropathy symptom score ( NSS ) neuropathy disability score ( NDS ) ( NSS &gt; /=5 NDS &gt; /=3 ) 21 % , prevalence painful symptom ( NSS &gt; /=5 ) 34 % . Despite less neuropathy South Asians ( 14 % ) compare Europeans ( 22 % ) ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) , painful symptom great South Asians ( 38 vs. 32 % , P &lt; 0.0001 ) maintain 50 % increase risk painful neuropathy symptom ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) . The potential association vitamin D beneficial effect neuropathy base experimental data show vitamin D3 upregulate NGF product neuronal target gene result improvement experimental diabetic neuropathy . Vitamin D insufficiency recently associate retinopathy self-reported peripheral neuropathy symptom even adjust demographic factor , obesity , comorbidities , use medication neuropathy diabetes duration glycemic control . Of course , may overlap symptom associate vitamin D deficiency diabetic neuropathy , may partly explain excess painful symptom observe Asians , particularly latter excess vitamin D deficiency . The preliminary data suggests urgent need undertake blind placebo-controlled randomised trial vitamin D3 treatment diabetic peripheral neuropathy . Aims : - To see association Serum Vitamin D3 level type 2 diabetic subject Painful neuropathy - Effect intervention injectable Vitamin D3 Painful diabetic neuropathy Study Design The study single centre , single ( patient ) -blinded , evaluation injectable cholecalciferol treatment painful diabetic neuropathy . Study Drug : Injectable cholecalciferol ( inj . Vitamin D3 600,000 IU ) . 1 . Sample size = 165 type 2 diabetic subject 2 . Recruitment time = 12 week 3 . Treatment duration = 12 week Data Analysis Statistical Considerations : The normality data assess data severely non-normal , log transformation consider . The primary analysis compare change baseline without alpha adjustment multiple comparison . Comparisons within treatment group across time also consider . The analysis perform Last Observation Carried Forward ( LOCF ) . Assessment Treatment Period : - Change baseline DN4 - Change baseline SF-MPQ - Change baseline NeuroQol - Change baseline serum 25 ( OH ) D , serum correct calcium ; parathyroid hormone , serum phosphate ; serum ALP - Change baseline HbA1c ; fast glucose ; CBC , urea , creatinine , electrolytes , urine DR , fast lipid profile</detailed_description>
