	<detailed_description>Obesity reach epidemic proportion become major global public health challenge since associate increase risk type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , stroke , arthritis form cancer . Therefore , large number strategy investigate order induce negative energy balance consequently body weight loss mainly induce low calorie diet sometimes accompanied increase physical activity . However , individual response body weight loss intervention vary widely several study aim identify psychological , behavioral personal predictor variability . In context , hypothesis present study part interindividual variability relation success certain weight loss treatment base gene-diet interaction . Depending composition diet genotype individual , less easy reduce maintenance body weight . After recruitment selection study participant , study consist 4-month hypocaloric diet ( `` body weight loss period '' ) follow second 6-month period ( `` body weight maintenance period '' ) subject study continue diet , without energy restriction . The participant assign one two hypocaloric diet ( -30 % studied requirement individual ) different macronutrient composition : - Moderately high protein diet : 40 % energy derive carbohydrate , 30 % energy derive protein 30 % energy derive fat . - Low fat diet : 60 % energy derive carbohydrate , 30 % energy derive protein 30 % energy derive fat . A group normal weight individual ( n 12 ) recruit order compare different parameter obtain obese subject normal population . They subject intervention .</detailed_description>
