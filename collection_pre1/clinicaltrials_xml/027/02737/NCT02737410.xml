	<detailed_description>Aims study , measure detail factor resilience adequate psychological instrument sample Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) patient investigate whether facet underlie construct . To calculate composite measure resilience base obtain insight concern structure resilience . To test hypothesis positive relation resilience response therapy . And finally , investigate difference patient untreated treat Gut-directed Hypnotherapy group cross-sectionally longitudinally , test hypothesis presume increase resilience ( use composite score ) change IBS symptom , quality life psychological distress parallel . Study location recruitment : N=74 Irritable bowel syndrome patient ( diagnose accord Rome III criterion ) age 18 70 refractory therapy recruit Specialized outpatient-clinic Psychosomatics Division Gastroenterology Hepatology , Department Internal Medicine III , University Hospital Vienna .

Study Design Treatment : Cross-sectional comparison perform data n = 37 GHT treat n = 37 untreated patient ( control group ) post GHT . This data pool dimensional reduction resilience domain . Resilience IBS severity data treatment group assess post GHT ; psychological distress quality life assess pre post GHT . A fraction n = 16 untreated patient ( former control group ) subsequently also receive GHT treatment . Pre post GHT data patient collect used longitudinal comparison , along pre post GHT data psychological distress quality life primary treatment group . In total , N= 74 patient examine , total 53 ( = 37 + 16 ) underwent GHT . Post treatment examination perform 10 month last GHT session . The GHT protocol use Manchester protocol GHT consist 10 weekly session ( 45 min ) , six patient per group treatment period 12 week .
