	<brief_summary>This randomise controlled trial aim explore effectiveness four week programme exercise use low limb Active Passive trainer ( APT ) ( MOTOmed trainer ) term spasticity people moderate severe Multiple Sclerosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Active-Passive Trainer Cycling Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise beneficial people Multiple Sclerosis ( pwMS ) . However , exercise option moderate high level disability limit . Cycling , deliver Active Passive Trainer ( APT ) one exercise option often offer within rehabilitation/exercise setting many pwMS buy APTs home use . Anecdotally , pwMS report feel good spasticity reduces APT cycling , however lack evidence support . 30 pwMS recruit Physical Disability Rehabilitation Unit Queen Elizabeth University Hospital , Glasgow , randomise APT + usual care usual care . Those APT group receive 30 minute APT ( 2 min passive warm , 26 min active cycle 2 min passive cool ) , five day per week 4 week . Outcome measure cardiovascular fitness measure use oxygen uptake efficiency slope ( OUES ) , spasticity assess Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) Multiple Sclerosis Spasticity Scale ( MSSS-88 ) , function assess Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) Timed 25 foot walk test ( T25FW ) , Quality Life measure MSQOL-54 . Outcome measure assess group 4 week intervention period . Symmetry , distance cycle power record follow cycling session intervention group .</detailed_description>
