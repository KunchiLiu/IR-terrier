PRO 140 placebo administer 350 mg subcutaneous injection Day -3 Day -2 prior stem cell infusion , day stem cell infusion ( Day 0 ) , weekly 30 day ( Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 3 Week 4 ) administer every two week 100±7 day ( Week 6 , Week 8 , Week 10 , Week 12 Week 14 ) . Subjects return clinic two Follow-up visit 2 week last treatment visit , one year first treatment visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnose AML MDS per : Patients history histologically pathologically confirm diagnosis AML &lt; 5 % blast peripheral blood bone marrow ( per bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy within 6 week prior screen ) schedule undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation Patients histologically pathologically confirm diagnosis MDS &lt; 10 % blast bone marrow ( per bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy within 6 week prior screen ) schedule undergo allogeneic stemcell transplantation 2 . Eastern Cooperative oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status score ≤ 2 3 . Patients must normal organ function define : If undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HCT : Males female , age ≥18 ≤ 65 year age Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome ) Aspartate Transaminase ( AST ) / Alanine Transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 time institutional upper limit normal ( except patient leukemic infiltration liver ) Serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/hr Diffusing capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) &gt; 50 % predict symptomatic pulmonary disease Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50 % . If 4049 % cardiology consult require Clinically normal rest 12lead ECG screen visit , abnormal , consider clinically significant PI If undergoing nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT : Males female , age ≥18 ≤ 75 year age Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome ) AST/ALT ≤ 3 time institutional upper limit normal ( except patient leukemic infiltration liver ) Serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 40 ml/hr DLCO ≥ 40 % predict symptomatic pulmonary disease . If DLCO ≥35 % &lt; 40 % patient asymptomatic , pulmonary consult require Cardiac ejection fraction &gt; 30 % Clinically normal rest 12lead ECG screen visit , abnormal , consider clinically significant PI 4 . Patients must reasonable expectation ≥ 6 month survival 5 . The donorrecipient Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) match criterion require participation protocol research subject study must meet criterion National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) donor . Procedures selection donor stem cell dose follow FDA Code Federal Regulations requirement Blood Products ( 21 CFR 640 ) Human Cellular Tissue Based Products ( 21 CFR 1271 ) . The standard institutional practice stem cell transplant also follow . The donor : HLAIdentical Sibling ( 6/6 ) : Minimal type necessary serologic type class I ( AB ) molecular type class II ( DRB1 ) Matched Unrelated Donor ( 8/8 ) : Molecular identity HLA A , B , C DRB1 highresolution type Matched Related Unrelated Donor ( 7/8 ) : highresolution molecular type follow locus require : HLA A , B , C DRB1 6 . Both male female patient partner childbearing potential must agree use appropriate birth control method ( birth control pill , barrier , abstinence ) throughout study duration ( exclude woman childbearing potential men sterilize ) . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Screening visit negative urine pregnancy test prior receive first dose study drug . 7 . Patients must understand voluntarily sign informed consent form 1 . Patients expect available followup least 114 day transplant 2 . Patients receive prior allogeneic stem celltransplantation 3 . Patients receive posttransplant high dose cyclophosphamide 4 . Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement malignant cell 5 . Patients receive investigational drug GVHD . Coenrollment clinical trial include experimental GVHD therapy allow 6 . Prior use experimental approve CC chemokine receptor type 5 ( CCR5 ) modulators include maraviroc PRO 140 7 . Patients uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection include diagnosis acute viral hepatitis ( define active infection hepatitis A new diagnosis hepatitis B C within 24 week transplant ) 8 . Currently active second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer 9 . Presence fluid collection ( ascites , pleural pericardial effusion ) interfere methotrexate clearance make methotrexate use contraindicate 10 . Patients HIV positive 11 . Females pregnant , lactating , breastfeeding , plan become pregnant study 12 . Subjects chronic steroid therapy &gt; 5 mg/day within 2 week screen except inhale , nasal , topical steroid 13 . Any clinical condition , Investigator 's judgement , would potentially compromise study compliance ability evaluate safety/efficacy</criteria>
