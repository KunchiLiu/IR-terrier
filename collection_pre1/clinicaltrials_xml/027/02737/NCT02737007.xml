	<brief_summary>This open-label , single-centre , non-randomized study investigate pharmacokinetics GSK3191607 , administer single intravenous ( IV ) dose healthy male subject . Six subject administer IV microdose radio-labeled [ 14C ] -GSK3191607 . The study provide early readout human pharmacokinetic parameter . The result study used estimate potential duration anti-parasite effect human , define predict clinical oral dos , hence inform compound 's potential safety margin . Each subject participate study 8 week , screen visit , one treatment period , eight outpatient visit , follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
