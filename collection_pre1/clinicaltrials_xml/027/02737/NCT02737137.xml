	<brief_title>Dynamic Multimodal Monitoring Ultrasound Guided Peripheral Nerve Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current recommendation peripheral nerve block ( PNB ) procedure advocate combine ultrasound guidance nerve stimulation . Despite different mean identification , nerve contact intraneural injection frequent . Even rare , nerve damage may occur . The nerve damage may relate direct trauma needle inadvertent intra-neural injection . High injection pressure local anesthetic ( AL ) indicator characterize location needle term tissue density . In clinical practice , local anesthetic injection pressure monitoring perform manually pressure transducer accord availability equipment preference clinician . To date , comparative study measure advantage measure PNB . The aim study evaluate injection pressure monitor order reduce risk intraneural injection . Group 1 : ultrasound-guided technique PNB `` plane '' needle approach , nerve stimulator set sentinel mode . Manual injection pressure control Group 2 : ultrasound-guided PNB , `` plane '' approach , Nerve stimulator set detection mode . Electronic Injection Pressure control low flow local anesthetic procedure</detailed_description>
