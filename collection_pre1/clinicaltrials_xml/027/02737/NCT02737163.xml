	<brief_summary>The treatment hydrocephalus time consuming , arguably important role pediatric neurosurgical service child 's ' hospital . Despite many technological advance , cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) shunting procedure remain mainstay hydrocephalus treatment . While often lifesaving , CSF shunt procedure associate high complication rate account disproportionate share health care expenditures morbidity . Programmable CSF shunt valve , CSF flow pressure adjust quick painless transcutaneous reprogramming , implant 15 year develop world . Reprogramming valve relies rotational magnetic force , apply neurosurgeon neurosurgical advanced practice provider . Inadvertent reprogramming ( IR ) occur patient valve expose magnetic field environment , may lead serious symptom may require urgent reprogramming and/or surgery . The concurrent proliferation magnetically sensitive programmable CSF shunt valve household item generate substantial magnetic field cause concern among patient , parent provider potential consequence inadvertent valve reprogramming . This grow concern lead FDA issue warn individual programmable valve 2014 , deem programmable valve safe use vulnerable IR household device tablet cell phone place within 2 inch valve . The FDA recommend study , state systematic evaluation perform regard prevalence accidental valve adjustment . By evaluate patient magnetically susceptible CSF shunt valve , routine point contact service , investigator aim define prevalence inadvertent shunt reprogramming , correlate presence absence symptom radiographic change , evaluate risk inadvertent shunt reprogramming base exposure common environmental item .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strata Programmable CSF Shunt Valve Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators intend evaluate patient 21 year old young magnetically susceptible CSF shunt , specifically Strata ( Medtronic , Dublin ) valve implant . All evaluation perform routine patient care hospital , emergency department outpatient facility . Valve setting check transcutaneously standard manner , MRI study . Evaluating IR make correlation exposure MRI environmental magnet symptoms radiographic change ( available ) require patient family complete brief questionnaire . It require study team delegate provider check valve set MRI , gather clinical information medical record current clinical evaluation . Each patient 's initial enrollment require acquisition inform consent , cover future evaluation IR three year study period patient . However , every time patient enrol study encounter neurosurgical service , study step perform , include valve check MRI , participant 's completion questionnaire , research staff 's completion data sheet .</detailed_description>
