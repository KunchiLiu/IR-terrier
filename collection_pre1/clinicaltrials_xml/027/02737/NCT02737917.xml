	<brief_title>The Use Emergency departmeNt Diffuse Apneic Oxygenation Versus Usual Care During Rapid Sequence Intubation Emergency Department Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxia may occur rapid sequence intubation ( RSI ) emergency department patient ( 1-4 ) . This condition may increase risk patient suffer cardiac arrest secondary securing airway . A part RSI pre-oxygenation , define place patient 100 % fraction inspire O2 3 minute prior administer induction agent ( i.e . sedative neuromuscular blocker ) order increase amount oxygen present functional residual capacity patient lung prolong oxygen saturate apneic period endotracheal intubation ( 5-9 ) . In last decade , physician develop process know diffuse apneic oxygenation ( DAO ) order mitigate risk oxygen desaturation apneic period . The process entail leave patient high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) oxygen act visualize vocal cord place endotracheal tube . Over year practice start become common emergency department , operate room ICU 's world . Recently , randomize control trial ( call The FELLOW Trial ) practice demonstrate difference desaturation rate patient receive DAO ( usual practice ) patient ICU ( 10 ) . Some comment finding study apply emergency department patient , evidence lacking regard population . Purpose study : Although study start investigate efficacy DAO prevent desaturation RSI , evidence still lack emergency department patient population . The primary question ask : diffuse apneic oxygenation increase average low arterial oxygen saturation rapid sequence intubation compare usual care ? Secondary question ask : diffuse apneic oxygenation decrease incidence desaturation general , well hypoxemia severe hypoxemia ? The third question ask : diffuse apneic oxygenation increase time desaturation ?</detailed_description>
