	<brief_summary>Weight loss commonly occur patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( COPD ) , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Loss muscle protein generally central component weight loss CHF COPD patient , patient also reduction fat mass bone density , independent severity disease state . The purpose study provide detail insight disease relate gut function obtain information gut permeability , digestion absorption glucose , fat protein CHF COPD patient compare match healthy control . This provide require information necessary implement new strategy develop optimal nutritional regimen CHF COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHF COPD Sip Feed Anabolic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General aim : - To study whole-body protein anabolic effect several dosage high-quality protein sip feed COPD CHF subject compare healthy control . - To investigate anabolic threshold subject COPD CHF compare healthy control . Purpose objective : Although Researchers ' previous study support concept supplement high-quality milk proteins chronic wasting disease i.e. , COPD CHF , dose-response anabolic effect proteins high EAA level still unclear . Furthermore , insight actual protein requirement COPD CHF . The knowledge gain study benefit insight term promotion protein gain feed COPD CHF subject . Based obtain data protein behavior ( protein kinetics ) Researchers able refine personalize nutritional supplementation COPD CHF subject order stop even restore progressive muscle wasting .</detailed_description>
