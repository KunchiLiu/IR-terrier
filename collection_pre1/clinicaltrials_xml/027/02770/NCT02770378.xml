	<brief_title>A Proof-of-concept Clinical Trial Assessing Safety Coordinated Undermining Survival Paths 9 Repurposed Drugs Combined With Metronomic Temozolomide ( CUSP9v3 Treatment Protocol ) Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A proof-of-concept clinical trial assess safety coordinate undermining survival path 9 repurposed drug ( aprepitant , auranofin , captopril , celecoxib , disulfiram , itraconazole , minocycline , ritonavir sertraline ) combine metronomic temozolomide ( CUSP9v3 treatment protocol ) recurrent glioblastoma . This phase I study subject 18 year old glioblastoma relapse radiation chemotherapy , confirm histology MRI . A total 10 patient treated CUSP9v3 treatment protocol . This monocentric trial : patient treat Ulm University Hospital .</detailed_description>
