	<brief_title>A Study To Confirm Efficacy Safety Terlipressin HRS Type 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter pivotal trial terlipressin subject HRS type 1 . HRS rare syndrome mark renal dysfunction patient cirrhosis , decompensated liver disease , portal hypertension . HRS type 1 characterized rapid progressive renal impairment poor prognosis &gt; 80 % mortality within 3 month . At present , approved drug therapy HRS type 1 US Canada . The curative treatment HRS type 1 underlying end-stage cirrhosis liver transplantation . However , many patient survive long enough receive liver transplant . Increased understanding pathophysiology HRS type 1 demonstrate vasoconstrictive drug therapy may reverse HRS type 1 . Substantial data available many publish clinical investigation literature provide compel evidence suggest administration terlipressin improve renal function patient HRS . A total 300 subject plan enrol approximately 70 site US Canada . An interim analysis schedule 150 subject enrol . The study stop pre-specified threshold efficacy criterion meet interim analysis .</detailed_description>
