	<brief_summary>L-theanine caffeine nutritional compound naturally find tea . Our recent finding use EEG paradigm consistent finding others , indicate intake L-theanine caffeine reduce time need person differentiate two visual stimulus react one stimulus . In order understand compound give rise improvement , investigator need study compound relate various area brain . To achieve , investigator plan scan brain nine participant take either 1 ) L-theanine alone , 2 ) caffeine alone 3 ) combination L-theanine caffeine compare placebo ( distilled water ) , see great impact attention region brain bring attention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment : Participants recruit advertisement social medium , electronic hardcopy noticeboards Texas Tech University ( e.g . Tech Announce , campus bulletin board ) , local medium ( e.g . newspaper ) , web-based medium ( e.g . Craig 's list ) flyer place bulletin board campus . Nine participant recruit screen follow inclusion exclusion criterion . Pre-Screening ( Telephone ) : Individuals express interest participating contact graduate undergraduate research assistant administer structure telephone interview : 1 ) provide information related requirement study , along potential risk benefit 2 ) Screen eligibility base specific inclusion exclusion criterion . All potential subject inform response remain confidential take part screen interview way obligate participate . The first 9 participant meet eligibility criterion schedule appointment ( Texas Tech Neuroimaging Institute ; TTNI ) immediately within 48 hour telephone conversation depend discretion potential participant . Each participant require complete 5 visit TTNI , schedule least 5 day apart , order complete participation study . The first visit 45 minute length 4 subsequent visit 90 minute length . The participant give right withdraw study point . In event screen include participant discontinue study prematurely , additional subject recruit maintain study total 9 completers . Since study cross-over design , participant expose experimental condition ( i.e . theanine , caffeine , TC distil water ) random order . Measurements : 1 . Recognition Visual Reaction Time ( RVRT ) Task : Participants instruct importance accuracy perform RVRT task advance . A blue-colored background present . Participants request press button computer keyboard ( practice session ) fiber optic hand-held device active testing session ( fMRI scanner ) use index finger dominant hand response white flash last 30ms ( target stimulus ) quickly possible , ignore red colored flash last 30ms ( distractor stimulus ) . During run , 20±2 stimuli category stimulus present inter-stimulus interval jittered 5000ms±3000ms . Time take respond target stimulus record RVRT . Omissions responses distractor stimulus ( error ) also record . 2 . Scanning paradigm : Each scan session schedule 20 minute , comprise 3 run fMRI scan participant perform RVRT task display LCD screen project via mirror attach head coil fMRI machine ( run last 4 minute ) follow structural ( T1-weighted ) scan last 5 minute . Data Collection Protocol : All recruit participant schedule 5 visit TTNI within 48 hour receipt subsequent evaluation prescreening material inclusion exclusion criterion . Participants remind visit via email / telephone ( per state preference ) 1 week 1 day prior visit . The visit schedule least 5 day apart . 1 . First Visit : Prescreening , Consent Training : 1 . The study explain thoroughly reinforce prior explanation ensure full understanding . 2 . Participants screen verify inclusion exclusion criterion re-administering screen questionnaire MRI safety sheet member BMTR lab . 3 . Informed write consent obtain . 4 . A participant number assign , identifies order administration four substance ( i.e . theanine , caffeine , TC placebo ) subsequent visit . This order determine use random number generator . 5 . Each participant provide solution 160mg caffeine dissolve 200ml distilled water disposable , clean , opaque , plastic cup consume completely within 1 minute , order train participant consume require substance subsequent visit ensure participant tolerate mildly bitter taste substance . 6 . In order acclimate participant RVRT task perform MRI scanner subsequent visit , participant perform training session perform RVRT task three 5 min session , separate 60 second rest interval use laptop computer ( supervision graduate / undergraduate research assistant ) . 7 . Each participant remind subsequent visit importance adherence preparation guideline . 2 . Preparation Administration Substances : L-theanine caffeine purchase purified powder form register supplier . Both substance store air-tight packing prior preparation administration accord manufacturer 's recommendation . All solution prepare administration maintain high possible standard hygiene . Each solution L-theanine make dissolve 200mg theanine powder 200ml distilled water . Each solution caffeine make dissolve 160mg caffeine powder . Both L-theanine caffeine powder ( 200mg 160mg respectively ) dissolve 200ml aliquot distilled water form solution TC . Two-hundred milliliter distil water use placebo . Each solution prepare within 4 hour schedule time administration store disposable , clean , opaque , cup lid . The participant instruct consume solution completely upon administration . 3 . Preparation participant Second , Third , Fourth Fifth Visits : All recruit participant instruct strictly adhere follow guideline prior 2nd , 3rd , 4th 5th visit order minimize confound result . 1 . Avoid consumption alcohol within 48 hour prior test 2 . Avoid smoke 12 hour prior test 3 . Sleep least 6 hour day prior test date 4 . Avoid consumption tea , coffee food / beverage contain caffeine within 12 hour prior test . 4 . Second , Third , Fourth Fifth Visits : Administration Substances MRI Scanning : 1 . Participants briefly remind purpose study . 2 . Adherence preparation guideline assess . Should participant indicate non-adherence preparation guideline discontinue study . 3 . The solution ( contain appropriate substance / combination substance ) administer participant visit provide disposable , clean , cup consume within 1 minute . 4 . A questionnaire regard taste characteristic solution administer . 5 . Each participant give verbal review RVRT task allow practice RVRT task laptop computer 5 minute . 6 . Each participant allow relax , seat comfortable chair , 60 minute elapses time administration solution ( allow time action L-theanine caffeine brain reach maximum level ) . 7 . Combined functional structural MRI scan perform participant engage RVRT task . 8 . Visual analogue scale ( 100mm line extremes measure parameter listed end ; participant rate measure parameter make vertical mark line ) administer measure perceive improvement / deterioration RVRT perceive improvement / deterioration accuracy task 9 . At end 5th visit , participant debriefed . Analysis : RVRT compare across four condition ( theanine , caffeine , TC placebo ) constructing repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) model use R-statistical software . Subsequently , pair-wise comparison RVRT perform four condition , maintain family-wise error rate 0.05 . Following sequence operation conduct fMRI data use FMRIB software library ( FSL ) : visual examination , distortion correction , motion correction , slice timing correction , spatial smooth statistical analysis . BOLD response compare across four condition construct ANOVA model whole brain level well region anterior cingulate cortex antero-medial prefrontal cortex . Pair-wise comparison BOLD response also conduct condition . RVRT , omission error include covariates fMRI analysis .</detailed_description>
