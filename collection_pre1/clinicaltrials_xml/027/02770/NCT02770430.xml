	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells First Treatment Line Resistant Acute Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( AlloSCT ) treatment choice many malignant non-malignant hematological disorder . However , treatment frequently complicate acute graft-versus-host-disease ( aGVHD ) , wich associate high morbidity mortality . Steroids still first line treatment establish aGVHD , response rate 30-50 % , establish effective therapy severe steroid-refractory aGVHD . The outcome patient poor overall survival low , patient alive 2 year . In case failure corticosteroid treatment , different therapeutic option introduce second third-line strategy . In scenario , infusion ex vivo expand mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) emerge additional tool treatment GVHD . MSCs non hematopoietic multipotent cell self-renewal property ability differentiate mesenchymal tissue . Several line evidence past year confirm ability thesis cell differentiate cell derive form embryonic mesoderm , osteocytes , adipocytes chondroblasts . In vitro , culture-expanded MSCs express membrane antigen immunophenotyped flow cytometry . The widely accept antigen expression pattern cluster differentiation ( CD ) 29 , CD105 , CD73 , CD90 positivity 97 % cell minimal expression CD45 , CD34 , CD3 , CD14 , CD19 , human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -DR , positive less 3 % cell . Because easy isolate culture due differentiation potential production growth factor cytokine , MSC become ideal candidate regenerative protocol . The purpose work conduct study patient refractory and/or resistant GVHD corticosteroid treatment . It randomize two group : one group receive MSCs group follow acute GVHD steroid-resistant and/or refractory treatment accord routine Bone Marrow Transplantation service Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre . It evaluate aspect immune recovery early MSCs infusion . METHOD : This prospective , randomize , control , open label study evaluate effectiveness early treatment steroid-resistant acute GVHD MSC . All patient refractory and/or resistant steroid GVHD include sign free informed consent . After randomization , patient allocate receive conventional treatment : 1 . Basiliximab 20mg dose adult 10mg child , 1 time week every 3 day worsen stage GVHD reach Very Good Partial Response ( VGPR ) maximum 4 dos , whichever come first . 2 . If item ( 1 ) obtain VGPR : Infliximab 5 10 mg/kg dose , 1 time week , four week even VGPR . Patients study group receive two infusion MSC per week two week 1 MSC infusion ( 2 + 2 + 1 scheme ) . After 28 day , VGPR obtain , crossover group allow well patient progressive GVHD spit treatment arm , day +28 . The latter group patient , use treatment ( MSC + Conventional treatment ) day + 28 analyze separately . Bone marrow ( BM ) derive MSCs normal BMT donor ( third part ) isolate expanded condition Good Manufacturing Practice . The quality control involve immunophenotyping , differentiation , microbiological control , mycoplasma endotoxin test . Patients response evaluation Day + 28 : 1 . Complete response : disappearance symptom 2 . Partial response : decrease least one degree GVHD 3 . VGPR : decrease stage I GVHD 4 . Stable disease : stability disease 5 . Number type infection first 100 day transplant The transplant-related mortality , disease-free survival , overall survival development chronic GVHD , also evaluate .</detailed_description>
