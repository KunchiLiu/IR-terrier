	<brief_summary>The goal propose research test hypothesis long-term mild sleep restriction ( SR ) , occur frequently adults adolescent , lead positive energy balance weight gain . Aim 1 . To determine effect SR , relative habitual sleep ( HS ) , food choice energy intake ( EI ) adult risk obesity . - Hypothesis 1a . EI , assess multiple weekly 24-hour recall , great period SR relative HS . This mostly due increase fat carbohydrate intake . - Hypothesis 1b . Neuronal response food stimulus , assess functional MRI ( fMRI ) 6 week SR HS , indicate increase activity network associate reward food valuation ( insula , orbitofrontal cortex ) period SR relative HS . These response correlate intake high carbohydrate high fat food ( hypothesis 1a ) neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) . Moreover , activation default mode network ( DMN ) suppress less extent SR compare HS . Aim 2 . To determine effect SR , relative HS , energy expenditure ( EE ) via independent complementary approach . - Hypothesis 2a . EE , assess doubly-labeled water ( DLW ) , physical activity level , monitor daily actigraphy , low SR relative HS . - Hypothesis 2b . Brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , assess positron emission tomography magnetic resonance combine scanner ( PET/MR ) use 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18FDG-PET ) fat fraction ( FF ) measurement cold stimulation , great SR relative HS . This would suggest high adaptive thermogenesis SR compare HS . BAT activation also correlate NPY . Aim 3 . To determine whether SR alters body weight adiposity relative HS . - Hypothesis 3a . SR lead weight gain increase total adiposity , assess use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , relative HS . - Hypothesis 3b . Increased adiposity SR correlate adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile ( increase glucose , insulin , triglyceride , leptin , reduce high-density lipoprotein cholesterol adiponectin ) neuronal response food stimulus ( Hypothesis 1b ) , EE ( Hypothesis 2a &amp; 2b ) . Failure stimulate BAT SR associate great gain adiposity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There association short sleep duration ( SSD ) obesity . Moreover , short sleeper ( &lt; 7 hour sleep/night ) gain weight time normal sleeper ( 7-8 hour sleep/night ) . These relationship increasingly support clinical data show restrict sleep duration healthy , normal weight adult , increase energy intake ( EI ) .</detailed_description>
