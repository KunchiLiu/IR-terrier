	<brief_summary>It assume gut inflammation lesion characterize flare Crohn 's disease ( CD ) result aberrant T-cell mediate immune response characterize complex balance peripheral lamina propria regulatory effector T cell subset . Because CD patient undergo surgery experience postoperative endoscopic recurrence disease ( 70 % one year ) lead clinical recurrence ( 10 % per year ) , `` model '' postoperative recurrence CD represent privileged situation mimicks happen gut CD patient clinical remission occurrence flare . It likely factor underlie immunopathogenesis CD early stage also contribute disease recurrence postoperative setting . Indeed , postoperative state perform intent disease remission situation represent probably ideal set investigate dynamic T cell subset peripheral mucosal compartment one may argue removal diseased segment bowel reset disease early phase , provide interest window well understand T cell subset predispose disease recurrence . That reason model use present project ) understand good immunopathogenesis CD relapse ; ii ) identify novel promise immune cell-associated biomarkers capable predict relapse disease finally iii ) identify potential specific therapeutic target associate T cell subset involve initiation disease .</brief_summary>
