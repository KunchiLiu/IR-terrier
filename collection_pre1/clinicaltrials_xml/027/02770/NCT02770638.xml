	<brief_summary>This study aim establish clinical evidence use scoop stretcher sport set spinal immobilisation transport compare traditionally use long back board measure tissue interface pressure forty five minute . All participant place scoop stretcher long back board forty five minute , least 45 minute two test . A special mat measure pressure body board use determine pressure force certain point body touch board ( mmHg ) . The participant also ask every five minute experiment rate comfort device . Pressure measure participant board collate assess along participant 's reported pain score comfort rating . The measurement tissue pressure analyse real-time software connect pressure-mat therefore show pressure increase time . A comparison board make .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background In recent year scoop stretcher , number reason , advocate Faculty Pre-hospital Care ( Royal College Surgeons Edinburgh , United Kingdom ) 'Gold Standard ' method extrication transport pre-hospital trauma extrapolate extricate athlete field play sport sustain potential spine injury . In addition advise conventional long back board longer use stretcher , pure extrication device . This implication emergency care currently provide sport affect every sport club financially every medical team require training use new device . Previous research study look much pressure lie different spinal board ( e.g . long back board vacuum mattress ) cause athlete . This concern lie board long may cause pressure sores medical complication . However , research do measure tissue pressure use scoop stretcher indicate general use pre-hospital care sport . Also evidence compare comfortable athlete find different spinal board . Aims This observational study aim measure tissue interface pressure perceive level comfort rugby player University participant ( staff student ) immobilise scoop stretcher long back board forty five minute . It also enable change pressure comfort rating time assess evaluate appropriate time cut immobilisation . Experimental Protocol Methods A prospective cross-over study . Players Nottingham Rugby Football Club University Nottingham ( staff student ) invite participate study ( summer 2016 ) . Participants randomly ( block randomisation ) assign start either scoop long board . Participants log roll onto board fully immobilise forty five minute . The wash period minimum forty five minute . All measurement collect pressure mat . Measureable end points/statistical power study The pressure mat ( provide BES Rehab ) lay top spinal board automatically measure tissue interface pressure reading ( occiput , scapula , sacrum , heel ) every five minute . Participant report pain measure Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) use collect comfort rating data ( occiput , scapulae , sacrum , heel , overall ) every five minute . Age , height , weight , sport team position play length sport participation also collect .</detailed_description>
