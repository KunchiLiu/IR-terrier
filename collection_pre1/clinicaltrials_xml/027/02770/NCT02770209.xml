	<brief_title>Autologous Cell-derived Tissue Engineered Cartilage Repairing Articular Cartilage Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injured articular cartilage limit capacity self repair . Without timely , early effective treatment , damage articular cartilage progressively worsen , result joint swelling , pain dysfunction . The patient ultimately develop osteoarthritis require undergo artificial joint replacement . Clinical therapy cartilage damage include microfracture surgery autologous osteochondral transplantation . However , microfracture technique limit small-scale damage , autologous osteochondral transplantation hinder limited supply . With advance material science , cell biology , biomechanics bioreactor technology , new generation biomimetic tissue engineer osteochondral composite display great potential repair cartilage damage . Currently , cartilage tissue engineering , seed cell derive autologous allogeneic chondrocytes , mesenchymal stem cell , embryonic stem cell pluripotent stem cell . Increasing evidence indicate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell induced differentiate chondrocytes , cell successfully use treatment large-size bone defect , cartilage lesion spinal cord injury . The quality quantity bone mesenchymal stem cell gradually decrease age , especially patient degenerative disease . Adipose stem cell umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell abundant similar characteristic bone mesenchymal stem cell , cell type induce differentiate chondrocytes . Adipose stem cell umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell use repair cartilage defect , finding still preliminary , cell harvest cultured large quantity . Furthermore , use embryonic stem cell complicate ethical consideration . As consequence , autologous chondrocytes optimal seed cell cartilage tissue engineering . The transplantation autologous chondrocytes combination tissue engineer cartilage scaffold repair cartilage damage require researcher focus two major issue , namely , ( ) vitro amplification chondrocytes ( ii ) preparation biocompatible chondrocyte scaffold . The preparation chondrocyte scaffold require advanced technique , currently , Institute Orthopedics Chinese PLA General Hospital capacity produce acellular cartilage ; source tissue engineer cartilage scaffold China . A proprietary allogeneic acellular cartilage-oriented scaffold successfully create Cartilage Tissue Engineering Research Group , Institute Orthopedics , Chinese PLA General Hospital ( intellectual property right ) . The innovative scaffold simulate composition spatial structural characteristic normal cartilage . The preparation method follow : articular cartilage pulverize obtain natural cartilage extracellular matrix , identical biochemical composition extracellular matrix natural articular cartilage . Then , porous sponge-like scaffold prepare use freeze-drying technique . In vitro experiment large-animal articular cartilage injury repair experiment produce good result . Using material , research group prepare biomimetic cartilage tissue engineer scaffold , mimic structural characteristic natural articular cartilage extracellular matrix . This allogeneic acellular cartilage scaffold follow characteristic : ( 1 ) derive allogeneic cartilage , extracellular matrix remain intact allografting , help maintain numerous component normal cartilage , particularly type II collagen proteoglycans , result enhanced repair . Cartilage scaffold use outside China mainly compose type I III collagen hyaluronic acid , vary greatly natural cartilage component . The original cartilage structure difficult reproduce type scaffold , fibrous cartilage may affect treatment outcome . ( 2 ) The biomimetic scaffold similar three-dimensional structure normal articular cartilage , orient scaffold structure . The scaffold imitates orientation normal cartilage cell , arrange perpendicular surface , provide paratactic columnar structure contribute columnar arrangement cell . This structure combination type II collagen proteoglycans derive normal articular cartilage result scaffold structure extremely close normal joint cartilage . Consequently , repair cartilage normal structure function . ( 3 ) The orient scaffold good biomechanical property . Its compressive stress well non-oriented scaffold wet dry condition . ( 4 ) The orient scaffold good biocompatibility . Preliminary experiment investigate immune response orient scaffold heterogeneous ( porcine ) conspecific ( rabbit ) acellular cartilage . After orient scaffold implanted rabbit , immune response observe aspect cellular immunity humoral immunity . Results suggest immunogenicity low . Thus , verify orient scaffold acellular cartilage good biocompatibility . Adverse Events 1 . Security Standard operating procedure adverse event severe adverse event develop ensure adverse reaction experiment treat quickly protect participant . 2 . Definitions 2.1 Adverse event Adverse medical event may occur cartilage transplantation microfracture surgery , necessarily causal relationship treatment . Common adverse reaction cartilage transplantation include fever , joint pain , swell effusion . Common adverse reaction microfracture surgery include fever , joint pain , joint swell effusion . 2.2 The severity adverse event Adverse event classify three level : general adverse event , vital adverse event severe adverse event . 2.3 Relationship tissue engineer cartilage The correlation adverse event tissue-engineered cartilage categorize `` definitely related '' , `` probably related '' , `` possibly unrelated '' , `` irrelevant '' `` undetermined '' . 2.4 Severe adverse event All event occur trial require hospitalization prolong hospitalization , result disability , affect ability work , risk death life-threatening event record . 3 . Adverse event record All adverse event experiment collect end study . 4 . Recording report All adverse event record physician , include description adverse event , occurrence time , end time , severity , frequency , treatment record . Once severe adverse event occurs , physician give necessary treatment , also truthfully report local Food Drug Administration Bureau National Food Drug Administration Bureau within 24 hour , well promptly report Ethics Committee . The data , treatment follow-up result note report . 5 . Follow-up observation non-severe severe adverse event If patient suffers non-severe adverse event , course outcome closely monitor . The course severe adverse event record follow-up report summary report . Patients also monitor , observation record period 30 day seizure . Statistical Analysis 1 . Study hypotheses All hypothesis evaluate two-tailed test . A value P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Baseline data comparability assess . Two-tailed statistical analysis perform α = 5 % . 2 . Number case A total 100 patient involve study divide two group , 50 case group . 3 . Experimental analysis Experimental data analyze use statistical software , SPSS 22.0 . Measurement data express mean ± SD , median , maximum , minimum quartile ; count data present percentage ( % ) . Count data group compare use chi-square test Fisher exact test . Measurement data group compare use t-test . Nonparametric variable group compare use rank sum test . 4 . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform professional statistician involve study . All data input review , statistical analysis report prepare . Administration 1 . Preservation articular cartilage Cartilage tissue preserve transported 50 mL centrifuge tube contain 8 mL tissue preservation solution , place test tube rack top ice pack , 4 °C sterile condition . Cartilage tissue transfer Institute Orthopedics Chinese PLA General Hospital within 12 hour . 2 . Chondrocyte culture preservation Autologous chondrocytes culture amplified strict accordance standard requirement National Institutes Food Drug Control . All image data record . Cartilage seed cell frozen liquid nitrogen . 3 . Data quality assurance ( 1 ) Researchers fill case report form ( CRF ) accurately . ( 2 ) Inspectors regularly verify data record correct complete , consistent original record , quickly transfer data administrator . ( 3 ) The data administrator examine CRF table return form researcher . ( 4 ) Two data clerk input duplicate data computer database . ( 5 ) The two separate set data compare computer software , modify accord CRF . ( 6 ) Quality control : 5 % case data randomly select manual checking . If data error great 0.15 % , data database manually check .</detailed_description>
