	<detailed_description>Clinical burden CVD : CVD lead cause death develop nation VA population exception . Despite decade research , technical , pharmacological advance , CVD remain major public health problem . This partly due impaired ability identify subject great risk CVD event thus best candidate pharmacological risk reduce therapy , partly due incomplete use efficacy currently available therapy . Epidemiological study identify major risk factor CVD include elevate LDL cholesterol , low HDL cholesterol , hypertension , smoke diabetes . However , despite target individual risk factor aggressive pharmacological intervention , CVD remain major public health problem . Furthermore , even individual risk factor treat pharmacological lifestyle intervention CVD event rate higher never risk factor . Recent epidemiologic data evaluate American Heart Association-identified cardiovascular health metric report prevalence CVD risk factor ideal level &lt; 2 % 10 ; imply &gt; 98 % population candidate risk reduction . Clearly , health system cope pharmacological intervention enormous target population . Thus , additional risk stratify marker need identify high risk event thus great likelihood benefit . Several biomarkers , include acute phase reactant C reactive protein ( CRP ) serum amyloid A ( SAA ) study role predict CVD event . Both CRP SAA chronically elevate individual obesity , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) , diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus chronic inflammatory condition associate increased CVD rate , raise question whether biomarkers merely reflect underlie risk play causative role CVD . Although emerge evidence cast doubt role CRP causative factor others recently demonstrate SAA directly atherogenic animal model . Thus , addition role biomarker CVD , SAA may play causal role CVD . SAA : SAA family acute phase proteins synthesize primarily liver . The SAA family comprise two acute phase isoforms ( SAA1 SAA2 ) well constitutive isoform SAA4 ( SAA3 isoform share ~60 % homology SAA1 SAA2 component acute phase response may pseudo-gene human ) . In healthy individual SAA concentration &lt; 5 mg/L acute phase response SAA increase 1000 mg/L day , rapidly return baseline level . However , chronic inflammatory state obesity , MetS , diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis etc , associate persistently significantly elevate SAA concentration 30-100 mg/L . SAA highly evolutionarily conserve implying must perform key function affect survival . Acute elevation SAA propose play major role response injury inflammation , participate cholesterol delivery injured tissue , recruitment inflammatory cell , induction tissue repair cytokine . However , chronic elevation SAA prevalent modern society likely reflect maladaptive response numerous study examine potential role SAA disease pathology . Using murine model acute phase SAA over-expressed , others demonstrate direct increase atherosclerosis development . Chronic elevation SAA hypothesize cause adverse cardiovascular effect . SAA apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) contain lipoprotein : SAA lipid bind apolipoprotein lipid-free SAA find vivo . The dogma SAA exclusively HDL associate lipoprotein ; however , others report SAA apoB-containing lipoprotein mice human . Several study report complex term SAA-LDL associated component MetS , remnant like particle cholesterol , smoke status15 , lifestyle intervention , statin treatment . These study suggest SAA-LDL risk factor CVD . In new preliminary study demonstrate SAA differential lipoprotein association diabetes , post-prandial lipoprotein metabolism , demonstrate presence SAA apoB-lipoproteins augments proteoglycan binding , key step atherosclerosis development . Thus , emerge evidence suggest presence SAA apoB-lipoproteins may novel CVD risk factor , play causal role atherosclerosis , thus therapeutic target . Post-prandial apoB-lipoprotein metabolism : The various lipoprotein define base size density criterion , well protein constituent . However , even within lipoprotein class considerable heterogeneity , particles undergo continuous remodel different lipase lipid transfer proteins act particle intravascularly various tissue . Briefly , lipid consume diet associate apoB-48 ( produce intestine ) form chylomicron , transport intestinal lymphatics enter bloodstream . Various enzymes act newly form chylomicron shift lipid protein chylomicron HDLs chylomicron remnant take liver . The liver re-packages lipid VLDL particle contain apoB-100 . The hydrolysis VLDL particles lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) lead delivery fatty acid peripheral tissue ; surface lipid apoC protein transfer VLDL HDL , result small apoB-100 particle call VLDL remnant intermediate density lipoprotein ( IDLs ) . Collectively , particle term triglyceride rich lipoprotein ( TGRLs ) . Ongoing remodel TGRLs various lipase include hepatic lipase ( HL ) lead formation LDL . LDL take peripheral tissue , include vasculature , liver . The sub-endothelial retention apoB-containing particle ( TGRLs LDLs ) initiate atherosclerosis . Post-prandial lipoprotein CVD : Elevated level LDL cholesterol low level HDL cholesterol document risk factor CVD contribute causally atherogenesis . However , individual obesity , MetS diabetes typically elevate LDL cholesterol ; dyslipidemia characterize elevate triglyceride low HDL cholesterol . The role triglycerides CVD risk factor remain controversial ; however , post-prandial triglyceride may significant risk factor fast triglyceride . As human spend live post-prandial state , ongoing interest role post-prandial lipoprotein metabolism CVD risk . However , study rely fast lipoprotein sample ; triglyceride lipoprotein component affect food consumption . The mechanisms accounting excess prevalence CVD MetS diabetic subject beyond predicted traditional CVD risk factor remain unclear ; however , insulin resistant state characterize increased intestinal apoB48 production , increase TGRL production delay lipoprotein clearance , may contribute CVD prevalence . Retention apoB- containing lipoprotein ( TGRLs LDLs ) vascular wall ionic interaction apoB proteoglycans , lead initiation atherosclerosis . Lipolysis VLDL double ability cross endothelium deposit lipids subendothelial space . TGRLs proportionately triglyceride cholesterol : however , size mean deposit 5-20 time cholesterol per particle subendothelial space compare LDL particle . Increased TGRL production delay particle clearance increase likelihood particle retention cholesterol deposition subendothelial space . We novel preliminary data demonstrate presence SAA apoB-containing lipoproteins increase proteoglycan binding . We propose increased presence SAA apoB-containing post-prandial lipoprotein insulin resistant state increase atherogenicity particle could mechanism account increased CVD prevalence insulin resistant state MetS diabetes . HDL metabolism : Like VLDL LDL , HDL comprise range particle ; however , HDL contain apoB , instead contain apoA-I and/or apoA-II . HDL often separate two major class size density : large HDL2 small HDL3 . As discussed , HDL undergo continuous lipid interchange various apoB-containing lipoprotein particle , primarily facilitate cholesterol ester transfer protein ( CETP ) . Changes lipoprotein structure composition various enzyme term remodel . HDL typically think atheroprotective lipoprotein due ability transport cholesterol away periphery back liver ( reverse cholesterol transport pathway ) . In addition , HDL number beneficial property include anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative function . In insulin resistant state HDL level tend low , study suggest beneficial property reduce . Like apoB-containing particle , HDL subject ongoing lipase activity remodel circulates . Remodeling lipoprotein affect functionality half-life ; example , remodel HDL CETP ( transfer triglycerides TGRL HDL cholesterol ester HDL TGRL ) predispose HDL enhance catabolism think contribute low level HDL see insulin resistant state . Although paradigm SAA HDL associate lipoprotein , preliminary study find SAA apoB particle insulin resistant person post-prandial period . However , clear SAA associate either HDL apoB-lipoprotein particle . SAA lipoprotein association : In set acute phase response SAA level increase 1000-fold ; however , even highly elevated level SAA remain exclusively find HDL particle . Thus , evidence `` maximum capacity '' HDL SAA . How SAA associate either HDL apoB-lipoprotein particle fully understood . SAA think produce liver lipid-free form bind lipoproteins extracellularly , plasma SAA show induce HDL biogenesis via ATP bind cassette 1 ( ABCA1 ) , may major mechanism SAA associate HDL . Murine study use knockout mouse demonstrate absence apoA-I apoE , thus absence HDL , SAA find apoB-particles . However , others report SAA apoB particle despite presence HDL . In new preliminary study find remodel HDL lead liberation lipid-poor apoA-I lipid-poor SAA , lipid-poor SAA associate apoB particle . Thus , remodel HDL , particularly post-prandial period , may lead SAA shift HDL apoB particle ; alternately , SAA could associate apoB particle hepatic secretion . Both HDL remodel hepatic apoB- particle secretion increase insulin resistant condition . Role lipoprotein-proteoglycan interaction atherogenesis : Pathological study identify progression atherosclerosis early fatty streak lesion ( visible young age autopsy study ) infiltration macrophage inflammatory cell , development advance atherosclerotic lesion necrotic core fibrous cap . There several hypothesis trigger initiation atherosclerosis , `` Response Retention '' hypothesis well support biomedical evidence . As outlined theory , early fatty streak lesion initiate deposition atherogenic lipoprotein ( LDLs TGRLs ) subendothelial matrix retention extra cellular matrix proteoglycans , visualize freeze-etch electron photomicrograph . Studies show lipoproteins migrate subendothelial space , bound proteoglycans lipoprotein retained region , become susceptible oxidation modification , take macrophage lead formation foam cell . TGRLs may even atherogenic LDLs n't need modification take macrophage , deliver 5-20 time cholesterol LDL per particle basis . Elegant study Boren 's group demonstrate mice express human apoB100 mutation introduce proteoglycan binding domain attenuate atherosclerosis . They go demonstrate despite impaired proteoglycan binding ultimately mice develop equivalent atherosclerosis wildtype control , due effect LPL serve bridge proteoglycan-binding-defective LDL vascular proteoglycans . Thus , addition direct interaction apoB proteoglycans , molecule facilitate lipoprotein retention act bridge . The presence SAA HDL show mediate lipoprotein retention . We others demonstrate presence SAA apoB-containing lipoprotein particle mice , recently confirm human . In preliminary study demonstrate presence SAA apoB-lipoproteins enhances proteoglycan binding . We propose presence SAA apoB-containing lipoprotein enhance retention increase atherogenesis .</detailed_description>
