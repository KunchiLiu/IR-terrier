	<brief_title>Rapid Plasma Genotyping For Early Initiation Of Erlotinib In EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . This research study determine rapid blood test use detect EGFR mutation patient newly diagnose lung cancer use information rapidly start patient pill-based therapy . This blood test previously use select patient treatment Erlotinib without confirm find biopsy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm metastatic NSCLC include recurrent disease one follow histology : Adenocarcinoma Adenosquamous EGFR genotype must know . However , pending EGFR tumor genotyping allow . Tissue must available genotyping biopsy plan obtain tissue genotyping . Biopsy requirement may waive technically feasible plasma genotyping reveals eligible EGFR mutation ( exon 19 del/L858R ) . Determination technical feasibility must make independently plasma genotyping result . Participants must possess least one clinical characteristic enriches EGFR mutation : smoke less 10 pack year Asian race . Participants must measurable disease least one lesion accurately measure long dimension &gt; 2 cm conventional image technique &gt; 1 cm spiral CT scan per RECIST v1.1 . Participants must progressive , advanced cancer define one following : Newly diagnose , untreated advance disease Newly diagnose , untreated metastatic recurrence earlier stage disease ( previous treatment early stage disease allow ) . Clinical determination progressive disease previous systemic therapy evidence plan change treatment . Any number prior therapy acceptable exclude previous EGFR kinase inhibitor . Age 18 year old . ECOG performance status 02 . Participant must able understand give consent participate study . Patient must candidate systemic therapy erlotinib base clinical assessment . Patients must meet following criterion begin therapy ( Note : require initial study enrollment plasma genotyping ) : ECOG performance status 02 Platelets &gt; 75 AST &amp; ALT &lt; 3x upper limit normal Creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min CockroftGault No contraindication erlotinib Female participant childbearing age must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal , barrier abstinence ) duration study receive erlotinib undergo pregnancy test . Any evidence suspicion pregnancy report treat physician immediately . Male participant must agree use adequate contraception duration study receive erlotinib Participants must chemotherapy within past 10 day . Participants must prior treatment EGFR kinase inhibitor , EGFR direct therapy investigational agent . Participants must residual adverse event previous therapy great CTCAE v4.0 grade 2 time registration . Participants must symptomatic brain metastasis brain metastasis require steroid . Asymptomatic brain metastasis require steroid acceptable . Participant must history allergy erlotinib . Second primary cancer active require treatment . Participants must pregnant breastfeeding</criteria>
