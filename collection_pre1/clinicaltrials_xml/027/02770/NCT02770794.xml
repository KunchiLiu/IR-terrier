	<detailed_description>The objective multicenter prospective clinical trial determine whether ultrasound predicts relapse discontinuation infliximab accurately clinical index investigate efficacy safety restart infliximab relapse patient rheumatoid arthritis remission low disease activity infliximab treatment . Infliximab discontinue enrolled patient . Patients follow 48 week monitor relapse . If relapse occurs , patient receive readministration infliximab follow 24 week determine efficacy safety infliximab readministration . Primary endpoint difference area curve ( AUC ) receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) analysis total power Doppler score Disease Activity Score ( DAS ) 28 baseline predict relapse within 48 week discontinuation infliximab .</detailed_description>
