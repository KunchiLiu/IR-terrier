	<detailed_description>Background : The Centers Disease Control Prevention estimate 13-20 % child live United States experience mental disorder give year estimate $ 247 billion spent year childhood mental disorder . In last 5 year , emergency department ( ED ) face dramatic increase volume pediatric patient present evaluation treatment mental behavioral disorder , point term national pediatric mental health crisis . Coincident increase exponential increase number child , child young 2 year age adolescent , prescribe 1 psychotropic medications—antidepressants ( AD ) , antipsychotic ( AP ) , medication Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) -- various mental behavioral disorder last 10 year . More intentional overdoses , therapeutic error , and/or adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) class medication evaluate pediatric emergency department ( PED ) , potentially attributable increase number child take medication . National Poison Data System ( NPDS ) -reported exposure medication class continue increase child adolescent . Numbers rate adverse drug event ( ADE ) emergency department visit involve psychiatric medication among US adult significant , although number child less well define . The development adverse medical condition relate antipsychotic psychotropic medication use child adolescent find significantly associate high total cost health care high utilization outpatient , emergency , inpatient service time . Interindividual difference people 's clinical response psychotropic drug adverse drug reaction despite identical disease severity etiology may better explain genetic variation among patient various factor . We determine genetic polymorphism gene cod CYP450 drug metabolize enzyme associate therapeutic failure and/or toxicity use GeneSight® buccal swab test . Multiple publish adult clinical study demonstrate combinatorial , multi-gene test well predicts antidepressant treatment outcomes patient depression use health care resource , individual gene comprise test . One study demonstrate 70 % great improvement depressive symptom GeneSight® guide physician ' treatment compare unguided treatment , another demonstrate 67 % increase total healthcare visit medication plan match genetic profile , contribute significant increase healthcare costs.19,20 Recent recommendation Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium National Institutes Health Pharmacogenomics Research Network suggest current data indicate genotype CYP2D6 CYP2C19 lead specific treatment recommendation . To investigator knowledge , study one first propose use pharmacogenomic test study toxicity treatment failure pediatric patient use psychotropic medication assess clinical utility patient present crisis ED . The result study likely change clinical practice lead increase pharmacogenomic test child adolescent point care outpatient clinic , inpatient service , PEDs . If successful , project lay groundwork future prospective analysis genotypic `` match '' versus `` mismatch '' either symptomatic toxic adverse outcome cohort present PED compare control population outpatient set . Study population : Inclusion criterion : Two category PED patient psychotropic medication include trial : ( 1 ) Children/adolescents present psychiatric/behavioral crisis intentional overdose . This would include referred psychiatric evaluation , may behavioral problem ( aggressive behavior , violent behavior ) , suicidal homicidal thought , recent history self-injury ( without suicidal intent ) , depression , psychosis , anxiety , alter mental status , violence . 2 ) Children/adolescents present PED suspect adverse drug reaction psychotropic/ADHD medication ( toxicity ) Exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) Patients aforementioned medication present PED chief complaint list . ( 2 ) Participants present acute intoxication alcohol drug abuse . ( 3 ) Patients Alabama Department Human Resources ( DHR ) custody . ( 4 ) Those medical condition preclude participation . ( 5 ) Those previous pharmacogenomic testing . Methods : The investigator enroll 100 patient 3-18 year age take 1 AD , AP , and/or ADHD medication present PED Children 's Alabama mental health/behavioral crisis and/or adverse drug reaction one drug . This would include referred psychiatric evaluation , may behavioral problem , suicidal homicidal thought , recent history self-injury ( without suicidal intent ) , depression , psychosis , anxiety , alter mental status , violence . The informed consent process take place study-specific procedure initiate . Signed date write informed consent must obtain patient/parent/legal caregiver prior enrollment study . Assent patient 7-13 year age obtain unless criterion waiver meet . Data Collection Buccal Swab : GeneSight use combinatorial psychiatric pharmacogenomics ( CPGx ) multi-gene approach produce personalize interpretive report categorize psychotropic medication three group ( RED [ use increase caution frequent monitoring ] , YELLOW [ use caution ] , GREEN [ use direct ) base objective , evidence-based gene-drug interaction . This decision support tool help clinician make inform , evidence-based decision proper drug selection , base test clinically important genetic variant multiple pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic gene affect patient 's ability tolerate respond medication . It consist cotton swab . GeneSight Psychotropic provide information 38 FDA-approved antidepressant antipsychotic drug . GeneSight® ADHD provide information 100 % FDA-approved medication ADHD . Blood Sampling : Blood measure serum concentration medication patient take obtain ( 15-20 ml depend many medication child take , 10 ml patient &lt; 14 kg ) . A small portion blood ( 5 ml ) also bank future DNA genomic analysis . These blood volume within accepted volume patient age range . Note : Blood sample normally obtain patient drug overdose , suspect drug toxicity part standard evaluation well many patient admit inpatient psychiatric facility . 12-lead Electrocardiogram : Rate , rhythm , QRS interval , QT , correct QT interval ( QTc ) , terminal R wave lead aVR record . The ECG usually standard part evaluation ingestions/overdose/suspected drug toxicity sometimes patient admitted inpatient psychiatric facility . In addition test also collect : ( 1 ) Demographics : age , sex/gender , race/ethnicity , live situation , educational attainment . ( 2 ) Medication History : list current past psychotropic medication treatment include name , dos , start stop date , estimate response . ( 3 ) All medication . ( 4 ) Socioeconomic information , include third party reimbursement . ( 5 ) Recall healthcare utilization previous 12 month include hospitalization ED visit . ( 6 ) Indication psychotropic medication ( note formal diagnostic interviewing perform constraint ED set ) . ( 7 ) Reason current ED visit ( e.g. , anxiety , panic attack , intentional self-injury include suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , homicidal ideation , medication overdose , harm person property , aggression , psychosis , severe depression , psychiatric cause , adverse drug reaction ) . ( 8 ) Global Assessment Function ( GAF ) scale , Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI-I ) , Clinical Global Efficacy Index ( CGI-E ) , validate scale use extensively psychiatric research ( 9 ) Clinical toxicity/adverse drug reaction . Note scale delineate # 8 ask information usually part physician 's history patient assessment : - self-assessment parent/caregiver 's assessment patient 's overall functioning , drug tolerability , drug efficacy . This information develop validated scale . The process design relatively brief allow study proceed within workflow PED . Some information obtain electronic medical record ( drug name , duration therapy , previous psychiatric diagnosis ) patient , parent , and/or caregiver unsure n't know . Statistical Analyses : - Descriptive statistic , specifically proportion , calculate : Mismatch proportion child present PED GeneSight RED YELLOW category . ) acute psychiatric/behavioral crisis ED visit ; ii . ) serum drug concentration , high low ; iii . ) overdose drug . - Frequency self-reported/caregiver-reported negative score GAF ( score 5,6,7 ) , CGI-I ( score 5,6,7 ) , CGI-E score - Relationship Mismatch ( RED , YELLOW ) Match ( GREEN ) self- and/or care-reported GAF , CGI-I , CGI-E score - Descriptive statistic , specifically proportion calculate : Mismatch proportion child present PED GeneSight genotype RED YELLOW category adverse drug reaction - Frequency GeneSight genotype mismatch RED YELLOW category specific adverse reactions/clinical toxicity</detailed_description>
