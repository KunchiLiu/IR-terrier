	<brief_title>Leg Thermotherapy Intermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease characterize atherosclerotic obstruction artery low extremity affect approximately 10 % individual older 65 year . The common clinical presentation peripheral arterial disease intermittent claudication , define leg pain cause insufficient blood flow walking . Individuals intermittent claudication severe exercise intolerance markedly reduce level daily ambulatory activity . It estimate 40 million people worldwide suffer intermittent claudication . Despite increase prevalence condition , medical therapy improve mobility exercise tolerance patient . An urgent need remain development novel , non-invasive strategy widely accessible eliminate need supervision frequent travel clinical facility . The study propose evaluate potential leg thermotherapy non-pharmacological intervention could improve mobility exercise tolerance patient intermittent claudication . Subjects complete baseline assessment eligibility ability study , include medical history , quality life assessment , ankle-brachial measurement , leg MRI , venous blood draw , assessment vascular function , 6-minute walk test . Treatment consist 3 treatment session per week six consecutive week . Subjects randomize low-heat therapy high-heat therapy . Subjects wear water-circulating pant heat therapy administer treatment session . Outcome measurement ( baseline assessment ) repeat 9 treatment session 18 treatment session ( end treatment period ) .</detailed_description>
