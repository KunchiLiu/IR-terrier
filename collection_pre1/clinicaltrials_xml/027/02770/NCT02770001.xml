	<brief_summary>Background : In genetic study , quality DNA sample test first . Samples low-quality use . Some study involve minority ethnic group . And example admixed African American . These study often small sample size . It important make sure sample discard unnecessarily . This may happen use quality control ( QC ) thresholds homogenous group . These may appropriate admixed group . Researchers want study sample fail certain QC test . They want see ancestry outlier quality sample . Objectives : To study sample fail heterozygosity sample genotype call rate QC . To see fail rate ancestry composition outlier quality sample . Eligibility : No new participant . Researchers review data already collect . Design : Researchers study DNA sample lab . The sample include data identify person sample come .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose IRB proposal gain access genetic data generate participant publically-funded genomic study deposit dbGaP . It intention use dbGaP data conduct secondary analysis influence admixture outcome data quality control ( QC ) genetic association study inform future study optimal QC metric genetic association analysis admixed population . The data intend use deposit dbGaP Michigan University Health Retirement Study ( HRS ) . This protocol send dbGaP requirement specific de-identified dataset review IRB protocol . This work require use statistical analysis tool estimate genetic ancestry make-up sample , genotype data , determine ancestry relate QC outcome ( i.e . whether sample might exclude analysis due ancestral genetic composition rather sample genetic quality ) . Objectives specific aim : This work aim investigate sample fail heterozygosity sample genotype call rate quality control ( QC ) determine whether sample call rate heterozygosity rate ancestry composition outlier rather quality sample inform future study potential loss general QC apply genetic data admixed sample set . Rationale Background : In genetic association study DNA sample quality vary largely across study participant variation impact genotype call rate genotype accuracy ; sample low DNA quality tend low genotype call rate genotype accuracy . Heterozygosity rate ( proportion heterozygous locus per individual ) genotype failure rate ( proportion miss genotype per individual ) jointly routinely use identify sample low DNA quality data quality control ( QC ) stage genetic association study . Excessive heterozygosity rate may indicate sample contamination whilst reduce heterozygosity rate could indicate inbreeding [ 1 ] . Samples 3-7 % [ 2,3 ] genotype call-rate heterozygosity &gt; 2-3 standard deviation mean heterozygosity usually exclude genetic case-control study . Generally , sample size genetic association study involve minority ethnic group admixed African American tends small . It hence important ensure sample discard unnecessarily , result reduce statistical power , use QC threshold apply homogenous group might appropriate admixed sample set . The aim analysis investigate sample fail heterozygosity sample genotype call rate QC determine whether sample call rate heterozygosity rate ancestry composition outlier rather quality sample . The motivation inform future study potential loss general</detailed_description>
