	<brief_title>EDS Ataxia Telangiectasia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient complete assessment design initial 6 month trial eligible continue additional 6-month , double-blind , placebo-controlled extension design collect information long-term safety efficacy trial treatment . Upon completion screen assessment eligibility patient meet selection criterion baseline randomize 1:1:1 fashion one two EDS-EP dose level placebo . A minimization procedure employ ensure proportion male female , young ( 6 &lt; 10 year ) old ( â‰¥10 year ) , patient comparable across three treatment group . Every attempt make ensure balance achieve across different region . A minimum 180 patient enrol , hence , group consist 60 patient randomly assign receive one two dose EDS-EP placebo , follow : Group 1 : EDS-EP dose range ~5-10 mg D SP/infusion , Group 2 : EDS-EP dose range ~14-22 mg D SP/infusion , Group 3 : Placebo EDS infusion . The initial 6-month treatment period consider complete endpoint assessment ( Visit 9/Month 6 early discontinuation ) perform patient . Patients experience severe side-effects , deteriorate significantly treatment provide inform consent eligible continue treatment additional 6 month double-blind , placebo-controlled extension treatment period . Patients meet entry criterion treat follow : Patients originally randomize EDS-EP treatment group ( Group 1 Group 2 ) continue treatment ; Patients originally randomize Placebo group ( Group 3 ) re-randomized equal proportion ( 1:1 ) receive either EDS-EP ~5-10 mg DSP/infusion ~14-22 mg DSP/infusion , follow : Following 6 month treatment , one third originally randomize placebo patient re-randomized treatment EDS-EP , describe ; After 9 month treatment , one third originally randomize placebo patient re-randomized treatment EDS-EP , describe ; At 12 month , remain placebo patient continue open-label treatment receive treatment EDS-EP , describe . The ICARS administer site rater score verified central remote qualify rater , base video record assessment site . The score provide central remote raters use primary analysis 'Modified ' ICARS ( primary efficacy endpoint ) . The site ICARS rater involve rating CGI- S CGI-C , VABS , QoL scale . The CGI rater access ICARS rating , may refer scale score CGI . All patient complete 12 month treatment trial , complete study assessment , provide inform consent eligible continue treatment EDS-EP open-label , extension study ( IEDAT-03-2016 ) . Retrieved drop-outs ( RDO ) , i.e . patient discontinue treatment prematurely complete final ( Visit 15/Month 12 ) efficacy assessment also eligible enter open-label extension study . Patients continue dose EDS-EP receive end Study IEDAT-02 , placebo , patient randomly switch ( 1:1 ) one two dose EDS-EP .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main Patient meet clinical criterion diagnosis AT . The neurological sign AT ( incoordination head eye lateral gaze deflection , gait ataxia associate inappropriately narrow base ) must document . Patient autonomous gait help periodic use support . Patient investigate proven genetic diagnosis AT ( prior documentation central laboratory test report ) . Patient least 6 year age , either sex Body weight &gt; 15 kg . The patient his/her parent/caregiver ( age consent ) , legal representative , provide write informed consent participate . If consent provide solely caregiver accordance local regulation , patient must provide assent participate study . Main General Females 1. pregnant , breastfeed ( EU country ) ; 2. childbearing potential , pregnant , breastfeeding ( US Rest World country ) . Females childbearing potential use adequate birth control , determine Health Care Provider , eligible . A disability may prevent patient complete study requirement . Current participation another clinical study . Medical History Current Status CD4+ lymphocytes count &lt; 400/mm3 ( patient 6 year age ) &lt; 200/mm3 ( patient &gt; 6 year ) . Loss/removal 250 mL blood within past 4 week prior screen . Current neoplastic disease previous neoplastic disease remission least 2 year . History severe impairment immunological system . Severe unstable pulmonary disease . Uncontrolled diabetes . Patients diabetes stabilize ( i.e . hypoglycemic hyperglycemic episode past 3 month ) eligible . Any severe , unstable , serious disease condition Investigator 's opinion would put patient risk imminent lifethreatening morbidity , need hospitalization , mortality . Any clinically significant abnormality standard laboratory examination ( hematology , biochemistry , urinalysis ) screening remain abnormal repeat test . Eligibility patient abnormal laboratory test value determine Investigator consultation Medical Monitor . Confirmed hemoglobinopathy , e.g . hemoglobin C disease , sickle cell anemia , thalassemia . Moderate severe renal and/or hepatic impairment . Prior/Concomitant Medication Any previous oral parenteral steroid use within 4 week Baseline . Treatment inhale intranasal steroid asthma allergy , well use topical steroid permit Chronic condition prior allergic reaction represent contraindication use dexamethasone steroid drug .
