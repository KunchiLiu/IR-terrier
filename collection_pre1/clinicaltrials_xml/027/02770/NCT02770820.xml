	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect laboratory-treated ( central memory/naive ) cluster differentiation 8+ T cell ( autologous Wilms tumor [ WT ] 1-T cell receptor [ TCRc ] 4 gene-transduced CD8-positive central memory T-cells [ TCM ] /naïve T cell [ TN ] lymphocytes ) well work treat patient acute myeloid leukemia newly diagnose come back . Genetically modify therapy , autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive TCM/TN lymphocyte , take patient 's blood , modify laboratory specifically may kill cancer cell protein call WT1 , safely give back patient . The `` genetically modify '' T-cells gene add laboratory allow recognize leukemia cell express WT1 kill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety/potential toxicity associate treat high-risk acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient polyclonal autologous CD8+ Tn Tcm cell genetically-modified express high affinity WT1-specific TCR ( TCRC4 ) . II . Determine feasibility treat high-risk AML patient polyclonal autologous CD8+ TN TCM cell genetically-modified express high affinity WT1-specific TCR . III . Determine compare vivo persistence blood primary tumor site ( e.g . bone marrow , chloroma ) transfer polyclonal autologous CD8+ TN TCM cell transduce express TCRC4 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether adoptive transfer autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cell antitumor activity patient acute myeloid leukemia . II . In patient measurable tumor burden prior infusion TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cell : measure change tumor burden assessment morphology , flow cytometry , cytogenetics and/or molecular test baseline infusion T cell . III . In patient ( without measurable tumor burden prior T cell transfer ) : compare probability relapse , disease-free survival overall survival patient receive TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cell patient observation arm . IV . Determine compare migration primary tumor site adoptively transfer polyclonal autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ TCM TN cell . V. Determine compare vivo functional capacity transfer polyclonal autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ TCM CD8+ TN cell . OUTLINE : Beginning 4 week completion last course chemotherapy , patient receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8+ TCM/TN lymphocytes intravenously ( IV ) 1-4 hour day 0 14 . Beginning 6 hour second infusion T cell , patient also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients clinically benefit T cell therapy may receive additional infusion T cell aldesleukin discretion principal investigator ( PI ) attend physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 4 week , monthly 2 month , 6 12 month first year , annually 14 year thereafter .</detailed_description>
