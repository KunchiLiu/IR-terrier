	<brief_summary>Our primary aim study investigate report enhanced clot state adult patient sickle cell disease use 2 laboratory test ; thromboelastography ( TEG ) Endogenous Thrombin Potential ( ETP ) , compare result healthy race match control see significant difference . Race match control subject carry well report racial difference coagulation parameter exist healthy individual . We aim study clot state sickle patient transfusion program hydroxycarbamide , treatment offer sickle patient ameliorate condition . We assess report prothrombotic state use TEG ETP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Thromboelastography ( TEG ) ETP Sickle Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD common inherit red cell disorder worldwide , genetic mutation SCD result production abnormal haemoglobin ( HbS ) . This lead anaemia unpredictable painful episode refer sickle cell crisis . Sickle cell crisis result significant chronic health problem include stroke , kidney failure , breathe problem , leg ulcer chronic ultimately lead decrease life expectancy . The method sickling result issue recognise complex thought patient may enhance blood clotting may play role complication get . Sickle cell patient report high risk blood clot deep vein thrombosis . Our primary aim study investigate report enhanced clot state sickle cell adult sickle cell patient use 2 laboratory test call thromboelastography ( TEG ) Endogenous Thrombin Potential ( ETP ) , compare result healthy race match control show significant difference . We also aim study clot state sickle patient variety treatment transfusion hydroxycarbamide , treatment offer sickle patient . Many trial show benefit transfusion hydroxycarbamide SCD , reduce risk stroke frequency patient get crisis . To best knowledge first study evaluate clinical utility TEG ETP adult patient SCD The trial conduct compliance principle Declaration Helsinki principle Good Clinical Practice . It submit approval London NHS Research Ethics Committee . Trial Design &amp; Flowchart This cross sectional case control clinical study patient sickle cell disease . Controls race age match participant without sickle cell disease . Written inform consent obtain participant . They sample take part usual clinic inpatient procedure 10 extra millilitre blood venesect phlebotomist nurse schedule venesect part usual medical care . Healthy control ask provide 10ml blood sample take qualified member staff . We aim collect sample 100 patient total 20 healthy control comparison</detailed_description>
