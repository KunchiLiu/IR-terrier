	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate differential effect neo-adjuvant leuprolide ARN-509 dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) concentration benign prostate tissue base HSD3B1 genotype . Secondary Objective ( ) : To evaluate differential effect neoadjuvant leuprolide ARN-509 androgen ( testosterone ( T ) , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , androstenediol , 5α-androstanedione ( 5α-dione ) , androstenedione ( AD ) , androsterone 5α-androstanediol ) concentration benign malignant prostate tissue base HSD3B1 genotype . To compare level DHT , T , DHEA , androstenediol , 5α-dione , AD , androsterone 5α-androstanediol normal malignant prostate tissue neoadjuvant treatment leuprolide ARN-509 To determine safety combination Leuprolide ARN-509 administer prior radical prostatectomy To evaluate prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) , FKBP5 , TMPRSS2 , EZH2 , H3K27 UBE2C tissue expression ( via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) ) benign malignant prostate tissue treatment Leuprolide ARN-509 ARN-509 .</detailed_description>
