Two hundred household enrolled 2016 additional 40 household enrolled 2017 . Participant household enrolled 2016 receive CO-CSA share two season education first CO-CSA season ( Y1 intervention household Y2 control household ) . Households enrol 2017 receive CO-CSA share education one season ( Y2 intervention household Y3 control household ) . In addition outcome participant , investigator conduct economic analysis evaluate impact CO-CSA farm community . While analysis related human participant , central overall project goal .</detailed_description>
