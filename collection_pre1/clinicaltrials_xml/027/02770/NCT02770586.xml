	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study positron emission mammography provide comparable sensitivity contrast-enhanced breast MRI woman high suspicion breast cancer . The aim study determine sensitivity Positron Emission Mammography ( PEM ) relative Contrast-enhanced breast MRI ( CE-MRI ) woman high suspicion breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Positron Emission Mammography Contrast-enhanced Breast MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Overview : The study population comprise 150 woman BI-RAD 5 6 finding recent imaging schedule contrast enhance breast MRI . Recruitment pool patient schedule MRI Department Radiology Mayo Clinic Rochester . All patient PEM study within 5 business day clinically indicate MRI . Subjects must meet following eligibility criterion : 1 . Recent imaging study ( mammogram , tomosynthesis , MBI ultrasound ) interpret highly suggestive malignancy know biopsy proven malignancy [ Breast Imaging Reporting Data System ( BI-RADS ) Category 5 6 ] 2 . Scheduled undergo recently undergone contrast-enhanced breast MRI 3 . Age 25 old The interpretation perform different study radiologist blind result study . Prior breast image study ( mammography , tomosynthesis , MBI ultrasound ) medical record available interpret physician . Following separate interpretation , integrate interpretation MRI PEM image perform match lesion see determine final clinical management patient . Reference standard surgical pathology biopsy . For finding resolve biopsy surgery , follow data , include image / biopsy perform 365 day period follow study entry ( date study PEM ) collect medical record review ( patient interview return clinical management ) . The primary analysis compare PEM diagnostic yield MRI diagnostic yield , consider standard trial . The primary analysis use observe MRI diagnostic yield control value . If 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI ) PEM diagnostic yield lie entirely MRI diagnostic yield value , PEM deem inferior MRI detect breast cancer patient population . If 95 % CI PEM diagnostic yield contains MRI diagnostic yield value , PEM deem equivalent MRI detect breast cancer .</detailed_description>
