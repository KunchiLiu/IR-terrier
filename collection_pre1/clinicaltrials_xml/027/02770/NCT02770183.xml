	<brief_summary>The rational study description evolution systolic cardiac function post-stunning , evaluate transesophageal minimally invasive echocardiography ( hTEE ) . The uses non-invasive method prove accurate qualitative semi-quantitative determination contractile function leave ventricle volume status patient . Furthermore use technique demonstrate reliable method analyze stun recovery infarction control cardiac arrest extra-corporeal circulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Myocardial stun secondary pathophysiologic condition sustain reduction myocardial perfusion , produce kinetic abnormality leave ventricular wall persist hour day reperfusion phase . The physiological element stun : ) reduction coronary blood flow , b ) partial complete restoration coronary artery circulation c ) dysfunction persistence limited period , long compare recovery coronaire 's flow . Cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass lead cause bewilderment myocardique . This technique associate administer cardioplegic solution use stop heart myocardial protection ischemia see myocardique consideration . It typically also secondary secondary inflammatory condition extracorporeal circulation ischemia-reperfusion phenomenon ( formation free radical ) , also important activation coagulation . Myocardial stunning occurs suit aortic unclamping cardiopulmonary bypass . Cold ischemia perform cardioplegic liquid 4 °C result reduce energy demand thus maintain balance metabolism , perfusion myocardial function coronary by-pass . When aortic unclamping , usually pure myocardial stunning ( without necrosis ) . After coronary by-pass , myocardial thicken fraction unchanged immediate future , significantly decrease hour full recovery follow hour . In factor associate change systolic function , autonomic nervous system responsible regulation blood pressure heart function response stress coronary by-pass postoperative state . Reduced variability heart rate ( heart rate variability - HRV ) hear sign autonomic dysfunction also associate myocardial stun rate cardiaque post-surgery complication high . So far group opportunity study `` vivo '' temporal evolution myocardial stunning coronary by-pass example myocardial stun `` control '' order well understand pathophysiology 'event . Indeed , basis myocardial function recovery time follow coronary by-pass unknown impact intraoperative procedure recovery . Transesophageal echocardiography , gold standard assessment systolic function , gradually gain popularity use daily ICU evaluate patient 's hemodynamic status evaluation contractile function leave ventricle load . One advantage measure heart activity bedside assist physician intensive care management hemodynamic acute change . It also allow also analyze response treatment define . Among limitation transesophageal echocardiography : need intensivists relevant technique , discontinuous nature procedure ( `` one shot '' monitoring ) finally semi-invasif character make difficult 'prolonged repeat execution various measure . Recent improvement electronics enable development miniaturize sensor hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiography ( ImaCor® ClariTEE® ) , call hTEE ( hemodynamic trans-esophageal echocardiography ) , use perform extended hemodynamic monitoring ventilate patient ; prototypes yet widespread Intensive Care Unit ; diagnostic capability therapeutic impact currently clinical research . study past allow u validate clinical image quality clinical information obtain useful clinical management patient . In particular , study demonstrate ease thanks small size probe , feedback superior vena cava , patient 's volume status , leave ventricular systolic function base Fractional Area Change , size right ventricle , pericardial effusion cardiac tamponade first test position sonde . The advantage continuous Htee new technique relate small size probe , ease position probe esophagus , diagnostic reliability ability stay 72 hour risk pressure sore lesion comparable nasogastric feeding tube ( size ) . Compared conventional trans-esophageal echocardiography , hTEE offer advantage perform continuous monitor rather case-by case basis . In particular , study post-operative myocardial stunning , technique allow verification time course myocardial stunning , thus describe pathophysiology kinetics recovery leave ventricular contractile function . Furthermore technique provide mean identify perioperative factor change recovery ( induce shorten ) .</detailed_description>
