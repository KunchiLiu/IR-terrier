	<brief_summary>Aim : investigate clinical effectiveness 12 week three different biomaterials , nano-hydroxyapatite base , therapy dental sensitivity . Methods : The study design randomized clinical trial comparing : 1 ) Cavex Bite &amp; White ExSense , 2 ) Teethmate™ Desensitizer , 3 ) Ghimas Dentin Desensitizer . The pain experience generate cold stimulus directly sensitive tooth surface assess use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . The response record application material ( PRE-1 ) , immediately ( POST-1 ) , 1-week ( POST-2 ) , 4-weeks ( POST-3 ) 12-week control ( POST-4 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants The study design randomized clinical trial . The participant select regular attender Dental Clinic University Sassari , Italy . Inclusion criterion : • patient consider suitable study sensitive teeth show abrasion , erosion , recession exposure cervical dentine ; Exclusion criterion : - teeth subjective objective evidence carious lesion , pulpitis , restoration , premature contact , crack enamel , active periapical infection , receive periodontal surgery root-planning 6 month prior investigation exclude study - professional desensitizing therapy previous 3 month , use desensitize toothpaste last 6 week . - Patients also exclude significant medication could interfere pain perception ( e.g. , antidepressant , anti-inflammatory drug , sedative , muscle relaxant ) . Randomization Using computer program ( Excel 2010 Mac OsX ) , randomization carry use individual basis . Clinical procedure A full medical dental history take teeth carefully examine confirm diagnosis DH . The experience dentinal hypersensitivity affect quality life patient evaluate specific questionnaire . The nature scope study explain informed consent obtain . A week experiment , patient receive oral prophylaxis . Non-fluoride toothpaste , soft tooth- brush oral hygiene instruction also provide order standardized habit period study . A week experiment , patient receive oral prophylaxis . Non-fluoride toothpaste ( Biorepair , Coswell ) , soft toothbrush ( Oral-B Sensitive Advantage , Procter &amp; Gamble ) oral hygiene instruction also provide . The level sensitivity experience patient consider independent position hypersensitive tooth oral cavity . The pain experience assess Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) use methodology describe previous study . The pain experience measure use VAS grade 1 10 . The pain stimulus give one examiner equipment yield similar air pressure time , another one perform treatment . Teeth randomly assign three group ( N= per group ) treatment three desensitize agent . The following dental material use follow manufacturer ' instruction : 1 . Cavex Bite &amp; White ExSense ( Cavex Holland BV , RW Haarlem , The Netherlands ) , water-based mint aroma gel contain hydroxyapatite potassium nitrate . 2 . Kuraray Teethmate™ Desensitizer ( Kuraray Noritake Dental , Osaka , Japan ) , Calcium-Phosphate-based powder liquid mainly water-based . 3 . Ghimas Dentin Desensitizer ( Ghimas , Bologna , Italy ) , fluid desensitize gel 30 % nano-hydroxyapatite , add 70:100 thousandths micron-sized crystal nano- hydroxyapatite .</detailed_description>
