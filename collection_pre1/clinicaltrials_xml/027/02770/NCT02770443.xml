	<brief_title>Withdrawal Medication Recovered DCM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Importance study : There grow population patient dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) recover left ventricular ( LV ) systolic function medical therapy . Recent study show favorable clinical course patient DCM1-4 . The heart failure ( HF ) guideline state discontinuation medical therapy group patient may consider base expert opinion . The safety withdrawal medical therapy need study . Hypothesis : In Patients dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) recovery LV systolic function normal EF &gt; 50 % , medical therapy withdrawal attainable without Clinical deterioration recurrence LV systolic dysfunction . Objective 1 . To study withdrawal guideline direct medical therapy , specifically beta-blockers ACE/ARB , patient DCM recovery LV EF . 2 . Correlate sustain recovery LVEF medication discontinuation specific genetic marker recovery . Method : Study design : It multi-center , non-blinded , randomize Control trial ( pilot ) compare withdrawal medical therapy patient recover LVEF ( recEF ) compare patient continue medical therapy . Therapeutic change occur 2:1 randomization Royal Victoria Hospital , Montreal General Hospital Jewish General Hospital . Patient would recruit Heart Function Clinic echocardiography lab . Procedures : Patient Selection : Patient selection conduct chart review , ECHO lab , well clinical visit . The DPS authorization request . Informed consent : At time enrolment study 's objective , procedure well risk benefit explain patient . A consent form provide patient . In addition , wallet card medication discontinuation chart . Randomization : Randomization conduct 2:1 fashion , non-blinded , seal envelop randomization system . Medical therapy withdrawal : Medical therapy withdrawal conduct 2 phase . Phase 1 : This phase involve withdrawal beta-blocker . The patient follow sign deterioration period 6 month follow withdrawal . Phase 2 : If sign deterioration ACE/ARB inhibitor withdrawn well . The patient follow 6 month sign deterioration . All medical therapy beta-blocker ACE inhibitor continue successful withdrawal beta-blockers ACE inhibitor achieve . Beta-blocker discontinuation : The initial tapering occur 2week period . The beta -blocker discontinue end 2nd week . For example : Metoprolol 100mg bid Metoprolol 75mg bid 5days . Followed Metoprolol 50mg bid 4 day , Metoprolol 25 mg 3 day completely discontinue . ACE/ARB discontinuation : The discontinuation ACE/ARB similar beta-blockers . The dos taper two-week period . A supplementary chart dose reduction provide . The dos include standard medication dos . Digoxin , diuretic , spironolactone discontinue beta-blocker ACE-ARB discontinuation well tolerated clinical indication warrant discontinuation . Up titration therapy permit . Additional therapy SBP &gt; 130 DBP &gt; 80mmHg non-ACE beta blocker therapy consider . Genotyping : Genetic analysis DCM cause gene send study patient . The genotyping selective , patient option opt genetic analysis prefer genotyping do . All sample store bio bank maximum 25 year . Two comparison conduct genotyping : 1 . The genetic typing Patients improve EF compare control group ongoing DCM cohort McGill University Health Center . 2 . A second comparison patient within withdrawal cohort . A comparison make patient rebound HF patient HF discontinuation medical therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient diagnose dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) initial HFrEF &lt; 40 % presentation . 2 . DCM recover LV function &gt; = 50 % document 2 ECHO examination , recent ECHO examination within 1 year enrolment . 3 . Time initial diagnosis DCM equal 24 month . 4 . Last hospitalization decompensated HF &gt; 1year . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Ischemic cardiomyopathy 2 . Other structural pathology : Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , Valvular cardiomyopathy congenital heart disease . 3 . Last hospitalization decompensated HF &lt; 1year ago . 4 .
