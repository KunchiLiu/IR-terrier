	<detailed_description>Subjects ask complete Substrate Metabolism Laboratory General Screening Questionnaire American Heart Association Health/Fitness Questionnaire determine eligible complete preliminary testing procedure . If eligible , subject ask visit Substrate Metabolism Laboratory participate preliminary testing procedure ( list ) participate experimental trial . PRELIMINARY TESTING PROCEDURES : - Blood pressure , height weight measurement - Body Composition Assessment ( ~20 min ) - Exercise Fitness Test ( ~10 min ) - Resting Metabolic Rate ( RMR ) measurement ( ~30 min ) - 3 hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) EXPERIMENTAL TRIAL : The evening experimental trial , subject eat standardized dinner meal snack . The meal snack must eat specific time indicated research staff . After eat snack , subject need fast ( food beverage - besides water ) overnight . Participants exercise regularly instruct exercise exactly 3 day experimental trial , abstain exercise training program study complete . In morning , subject return Substrate Metabolism Laboratory . The research team collect blood sample subject 's hand forearm small sample fat tissue subject 's abdomen needle . Next , subject exercise treadmill moderate intensity 1 hour . Immediately exercise research team collect second blood sample . Subjects remain laboratory 1 hour exercising , research team collect another blood fat tissue sample . Upon completion experimental trial , subject provide snack leave laboratory .</detailed_description>
