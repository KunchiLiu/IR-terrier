	<brief_summary>The investigator use Compensatory Reserve Index ( CRI ) device monitor hemodynamic status patient hospital . CRI value patient monitor care order verify compliance value physiological condition . During protocol investigator document patient injury , life-saving procedure perform , response treatment well progress systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) sepsis . The index measure study consideration handle patient . The medical team expose metric measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Assessment patient emergency department , ICU surgical department challenge process . This assessment include collect data regard injury mechanism , vital sign , physical examination finding proceed way evaluate patient . These data integrate attempt form accurate patient status determine urgency treatment evacuation next echelon care necessary . When care multiple casualty , process take even great importance care one patient delay care others . Triage monitoring patient consist several vital sign measurement include blood pressure , oxygen saturation , heart rate . These measurement show vary correlation patient survival , Injury Severity Score , need life-saving intervention . The significant disadvantage use part patient triage retrospective nature , change index occur substantial hemodynamic compromise failure compensatory mechanisms life-saving intervention might late . Because limitation inherent vital sign , several calculate index suggest attempt integrate vital sign sensitive metric prediction patient outcomes . The frequently describe metric shock index ( SI ) , calculate ratio heart rate systolic blood pressure ( normal value , 0.5 Y 0.7 ) , demonstrate superiority index . Heart rate variability also frequently suggest calculated vital sign , clinical utility acute blood loss set proven limit result high interpatient intrapatient variability . The Compensatory Reserve Index ( CRI ) represent new paradigm measure physiological reserve integrate cardiopulmonary mechanism ( e.g. , tachycardia , vasoconstriction , breathe ) compensate reduce central blood volume . Advanced sensor technology photoplethysmography enable noninvasive recording analog arterial waveform . Using model induces stepwise reduction central blood volume ( low body negative pressure [ LBNP ] ) volunteer young healthy human test subject , application negative pressure lower body , feature-extraction machine-learning technique use reveal subtle change waveform feature associate decline volume . This approach enable simultaneous abstraction normalization various characteristic arterial waveform . As , CRI aim reflect capacity factor contribute physiological compensatory mechanism , include compensatory reflex , various muscle contraction , respiration , among others . Compensatory Reserve Index value range 0 ( complete decompensation ) 1 ( full compensatory reserve available ) . The device compact , light , place patient 's finger , test perform within 30 , make measurement CRI theoretically feasible almost setting . The approach design prospectively identify ongoing loss central blood volume thus estimate point individual experience hemodynamic decompensation ( onset shock ) well advance compare change standard `` legacy '' vital sign . The CRI show correlate central blood volume change human subject laboratory condition however , publish data regard use experimental model ability detect actual blood loss exist . The current investigation represent first effort apply small pulse oximeter unit test CRI human subject admit hospital . The purpose study test hypothesis novel noninvasive CRI monitoring algorithm would demonstrate great sensitivity specificity compare standard vital sign identify patient blood loss , SIRS , sepsis thus enable appropriate measure take .</detailed_description>
