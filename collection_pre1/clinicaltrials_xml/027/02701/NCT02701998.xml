	<detailed_description>Stroke recently decline third fifth lead cause death United States . However , Stroke remain leading cause long-term disability among expensive chronic disease , cost US approximately 34 billion dollar per year . The decrease stroke-related mortality lead increase stroke survivor , estimate overall prevalence increase 25 % 2030 record 11 million stroke survivor . Importantly , two-thirds nearly one million Americans experience ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) regain functional independence . In patient , engagement habitual purposeful physical activity ( PA ) powerful mean secondary stroke prevention . Habitual PA improve several important health indicator stroke survivor , include cardiorespiratory fitness , functional independence , gait stability , overall vascular health , cognition , also reduce risk fall , cardiometabolic disease , adverse recurrent event . Consequently , American Heart Association/American Stroke Association ( AHA/ASA ) recommend patient survive stroke regain functional independence increase PA reduce sedentary behavior ( SB ) . However , recommendation always prescribe , prescribe , patient compliance often poor . Recent research involve use objective PA monitor show stroke survivor significantly less active control maintain high level SB one-year discharge , regardless functional capacity . This especially problematic give patient engage low PA high SB level stroke experience cardiovascular deconditioning , worsen PA intolerance , additional disability , ultimately increase risk recurrent event . Several barrier may account low PA high SB level stroke survivor . Many avoid engage PA due fear fall trigger recurrent event . However , risk inactivity regard far great risk associate adopt habitual PA. Other barrier may include post-stroke fatigue , depression , lack interest , motivation , negative belief towards PA , lack support PA behavior change . Despite obvious need behavioral intervention assist stroke survivor overcome barrier adoption maintenance habitual PA , relatively . Most intervention date include intensive costly supervise exercise component include instruction standard PA behavior change strategy ( e.g. , self-monitoring , goal-setting , reinforcement ) . The recent advent commercially available mobile health ( mHealth ) technology automatically monitor provide feedback time spend PA SB ( i.e. , fitness/activity tracker ) provide potentially powerful mean enhance efficacy reach intervention target stroke survivor . While recent randomize control trial show provide similar fitness/activity tracker combination single in-person goal setting/counseling session relate printed behavior change material effective pedometer print material increase daily moderate-to-vigorous PA ( MVPA ) step old overweight woman , feasibility , acceptability , efficacy approach post-stroke TIA patient unknown . The propose project involve randomize controlled trial test feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy mHealth-enhanced PA intervention increase daily bout-related ( ≥10-minute bout ) total ( ≥1-minute bout ) moderate-intensity PA ( MPA ) decrease daily SB 70 non-physically impaired patient ischemic stroke TIA . After visit Weight Control Diabetes Research Center ( WCDRC ) complete baseline assessment include wear multi-sensor armband 7 day monitor daily MPA SB , participant randomize 12 week either : mHealth-enhanced PA intervention ( Tech-PAI ; n=35 ) standard PA intervention ( PAI ; n=35 ) , serve active control group . Participants assign Tech-PAI receive 2 face-to-face goal-setting/counseling session ( one baseline set individualized goal use data observe baseline armband monitor ) first 6 week intervention mid-intervention point ( i.e . evaluate progress refine individualize goal ) , fitness/activity tracker access accompany website monitor observe progress towards set goal , weekly online skill train video ( week 1-6 ) help change PA SB behavior , weekly e-mail feedback research staff progress towards goal ( week 1-12 ) . Participants assign PAI also receive two face-to-face PA goal-setting counseling session , pedometer , print material assist record increase MPA step . Participants group wear multi-sensor armband monitor 7 day mid-intervention ( end week 6 ) post-intervention ( end week 12 ) . The Tech-PAI PAI group compare change daily time spend MPA SB baseline mid- post-intervention . At time point , group compare change performance-based measure cardiorespiratory/physical cognitive function ; questionnaire-based assessment stroke-specific impact quality life PA-related attitude beliefs ; blood pressure inflammation ( i.e . C-reactive protein level collect via blood sample ) . Finally , acceptability Tech-PAI examine indicated fitness tracker relate website usage pattern , completion online skill train session , participant satisfaction rating .</detailed_description>
