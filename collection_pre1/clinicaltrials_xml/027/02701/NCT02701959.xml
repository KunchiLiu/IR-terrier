	<brief_summary>Leafy vegetables natural source dietary nitrate , may reduce systolic blood pressure ( BP ) . However , evidence obtain study use nitrate solution ( i.e. , potassium sodium nitrate ) beetroot juice supplementation suitable placebo design double-blind clinical trial . However , design food-based nutritional intervention complicate fact appropriate placebo treatment available , therefore , possible meet criterion proper double-blind randomise placebo-controlled intervention trial . In addition , biological effect process product beetroot juice solution pharmacological grade may different fresh vegetable , e.g . due conversion nitrate nitrite mouth chew . Objectives : investigate whether two set lettuce specifically grown different nitrate content otherwise similar composition show different effect nitrate uptake bioavailability human . Additionally , investigator also aim design human intervention study investigate effect intake lettuce different nitrate content vascular health . These objective test grow lettuce different fertiliser composition result high low nitrate content investigate bioavailability short-term effect BP healthy young volunteer double-blind cross-over design . Eligible subject consume one meal either low high nitrate lettuce . Urine , blood saliva sample collect baseline , 6 hour ingestion 24hr . Blood Pressure BP measure continuously 24 hour start baseline . The volunteer repeat intervention second treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Subjects : This study design double-blind , randomize , crossover , intervention trial thirty healthy young volunteer ( BMI : 20-25 kg/m2 ) , non-smoking subject ( age : 18-35 year ) recruit . In two intervention period , subject ask eat 50g either high nitrate lettuce low nitrate lettuce ( placebo ) single occasion ( second visit ) dietary restriction 3 day prior second visit 24 hr period follow consumption , conclude third visit , least 3 week washout period second 2-day intervention period . Urine , saliva blood sample collect 6-hour period second visit . Urine sample collect 24h consumption third visit , assess pharmacokinetics bioavailability compliance intervention ( detail diagram human trial ) . The primary outcome 24-hour BP nitrate content urine , plasma saliva . Samples collect tube analyse laboratory nitrate content ( NO3- ) gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy ( GCMS ) . Participants follow specific dietary lifestyle instruction minimise confound effect . Participant receive small honorarium study reasonable travel expense reimburse . Dietary Interventions : Participants ask arrive fasting morning second ( main ) visit consume standard meal ( Chicken Hotpot ASDA ) drink water even even visit , well follow diet excludes list specific food contain high nitrate ( rocket , spinach , leafy vegetable , radish beet root ) , cure meat , cure seafood cured fish , mature cheese 24hr prior study fast morning study . Anthropometry : This include measurement body weight , height waist circumference accord standardised protocol . Procedures safe , invasive induce minimal discomfort participant . Body Composition : This include measurement body fat muscle use non-invasive technique call bio impedance analysis use leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance device ( TANITA 300 MA ) . The procedure safe , non-invasive induces minimal discomfort participant . The duration measurement approximately 3-5 minute . 24-hr BP monitoring : participant fit automate portable device measure BP 24-hr period . Participants instruct safely operate device . The measurement safe minimally invasive . BP reading record every 30 minute day time every hour night minimise potential impact sleep quality . Urine sample : The first morning void ( FMV ) collect home ( pre supplementation ) arrival full urine sample ( volunteer able produce ) set time supplementation ( baseline 6hr ) NU-Food research facility . Subsequent collection afterwards ( 6-12hr 12-24 hr ) take place home appropriate plastic container sample collect final visit 24hr consumption . After measure volume sample , sub sample store analysis calculation pharmacokinetics . Saliva sample : small saliva sample ( ~2ml ) collect disposable plastic container baseline every hour 6 hour NU-Food research facility ; 9 12 hour home , final sample take 24 hr . Blood Samples : Venous blood sample ( LH 6 ml ) collect baseline , three six hour post supplementation treatment 24 hr .</detailed_description>
