	<brief_title>SMF Improve Performance Microscopy Diagnosis PTB High HIV Prevalence Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB disease cause bacterium call Mycobacterium tuberculosis affect lung part body . In world Mbarara , Uganda , method diagnosis use AFB smear microscopy . This method widely available , inexpensive rapid . However , method 's ability truly detect people TB poor . That , someone TB , test result may say negative , leading delay diagnosis , disease progression , ongoing transmission bacteria . The new test TB diagnosis study call Small Membrane Filtration ( SMF ) method . This test compare method currently use similar one currently use ( standard smear microscopy ) advantage concentrate sputum ( mucus ) easily see bacteria present sputum . It hop good way know someone TB help doctor decide people need treat TB , improve health patient help avoid pass infection others . This study enroll 740 HIV-infected 310 HIV-uninfected adult culture confirm pulmonary TB . These individual identify prospectively two TB clinic Mbarara , Uganda . Study hypothesis : The investigator assume one sputum sample equivalent two ( null hypothesis ) respect sensitivity unless evidence use two high sensitivity ( alternative hypothesis ) . The investigator assume SMF equivalent AFB smear respect sensitivity specificity unless investigator find evidence superior . The investigator assume SMF equivalent Xpert unless investigator find evidence Xpert superior .</detailed_description>
