	<detailed_description>For woman diagnose early stage breast cancer , lumpectomy follow radiation common treatment option . Radiation treatment typically deliver whole breast , five time per week , anywhere 3 8 week . The radiation help kill cancer cell may leave follow surgery cause skin burn . Many study demonstrate radiation whole breast necessary , deliver portion breast cancer likely recur . A technique call Permanent Breast Seed Implant ( PBSI ) involve implantation radioactive seed develop deliver radiation portion breast . The procedure perform out-patient basis local anesthesia light sedation . Because radioactive seed permanently implant breast , patient able live normal life seed deliver prescribe radiation breast . Previous study Permanent Breast Seed Implant ( PBSI ) demonstrate safe effective alternative form radiation appropriately select patient lumpectomy . However , result obtain mainly single institution , 4 patient treat another center . Further research still need evaluate safety multi-center setting . The purpose study ensure appropriate training clinician perform procedure capture long term outcome rare complication . Due wide-spread use mammography , breast cancer commonly diagnose early stage . The standard treatment early-stage disease breast conserving surgery follow adjuvant radiation therapy whole breast . This approach lead low recurrence rate good cosmesis provide effective alternative mastectomy . However , half woman develop significant acute skin toxicity follow whole breast irradiation . These reaction occur frequently infra-mammary fold , associate pain , associate reduction health-related quality life . Whole breast radiotherapy involve several daily treatment deliver period 3 7 week disruptive patient 's life . To address drawback , concept accelerate partial breast irradiation propose . It arose realization majority tumor recurrence occur near region prior lumpectomy site , suggest well select patient breast tissue surround tumor bed might need radiation treatment . Accelerated partial breast irradiation limit radiation small portion breast ( surround tumor cavity ) advantage reduce radiation-induced toxicity increase convenience deliver within much short period time . In reduce volume breast treat , high dose radiation deliver treatment session . Accelerated partial breast irradiation advantage include reduction amount irradiate skin therefore possibility reduce radiation-induced skin toxicity , increase convenience accelerate . Several accelerate partial breast irradiation technique report include external beam conformal irradiation , intra-operative radiotherapy brachytherapy technique . Brachytherapy widely evaluate accelerate partial breast irradiation technique . It involve insertion radioactive material directly surgical cavity use tubes catheter . Treatments generally deliver outpatient procedure use high dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy , deliver multiple treatment ( 8 10 ) period 5 8 day . Intra-operative radiotherapy deliver single session time initial surgery . A permanent breast seed implant ( PBSI ) technique partial breast irradiation use palladium ( 103Pd ) seed propose . Similar permanent seed implant use treat prostate cancer , permanent breast seed implant ( PBSI ) involve insertion strand radioactive seed ultra-sound guidance . The advantage permanent breast seed implant ( PBSI ) technique brachytherapy technique include : i/- out-patient procedure perform single one-hour session local anesthesia light sedation ; ii/- perform surgery final pathology report available scar completely heal ; iii/- use low dose rate technique present possible advantage efficient well tolerate compare high dose rate technique . The local recurrence rate , immediate delay toxicity , radiation safety quality assurance data suggest permanent breast seed implant ( PBSI ) safe acceptable option accelerate partial breast irradiation , capable deliver right amount dose right location select early stage breast cancer . However , result obtain mainly single institution , 4 patient treat another center . Further research still need evaluate safety multi-center setting also detect serious adverse event large number patient treat large group practitioner . Since brachytherapy operator dependent , registry represent unique opportunity ensure appropriate training radiation oncologist capture capture long term outcome .</detailed_description>
