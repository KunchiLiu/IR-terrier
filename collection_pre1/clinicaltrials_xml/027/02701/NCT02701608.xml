	<brief_summary>Infective endocarditis ( IE ) serious infection significant burden patient hospital ( France , median length hospital stay = 43 day ) , partly due long duration intravenous ( IV ) antibacterial treatment recommend international guideline , 4 6 week situation . A recent survey practice regard management IE France show switch IV oral antibiotic feasible , patient left-sided Staphylococcus IE stable initial course IV antibiotic treatment , without valvular surgery . These practice associate unfavourable outcome , significantly reduce duration cost hospitalization , risk nosocomial infection , patient ' discomfort . There randomize control trial ( RCT ) field IE last 20 year ; current guideline mostly base expert advice , vitro study , animal experiment , clinical study perform 90 's . The RODEO 1 project unprecedented opportunity bring back evidence-based medicine field IE . Most expert acknowledge pharmacological PK/PD characteristic antibiotic fluoroquinolones rifampicin allow high level efficacy treatment IE orally administrate IV period induction . It 's need conduct RCTs clearly demonstrate clinical non-inferiority strategy multisusceptible staphylococci benefit regard cost . The RODEO 1 project correspond one pragmatic trial assess impact switch strategy , make comparative effectiveness trial able feed next revision IE international guideline change practice IE management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Switch During Treatment Left-sided Endocarditis Due Multi-susceptible Staphylococcus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The RODEO 1 study design determine safety efficacy partial oral treatment IE compare traditional full-length parenteral treatment . Our primary objective demonstrate patient left-sided multi-susceptible Staphylococcus receive least 10 day IV antibiotic treatment without valvular surgery , switch oral combination rifampicin fluoroquinolones Day 10 Day 28 initiation IV antibiotic treatment , inferior continuation conventional IV antibiotic treatment regard treatment failure within 3 month end antibiotic treatment . Nationwide , noninferiority , multicenter , randomize , control , open-label trial . Randomisation offer patient receive least 10 day IV conventional antibiotic treatment IE , fulfil inclusion criterion . Randomisation take place Day 10 Day 28 initiation parenteral antibiotic therapy valvular surgery , thus ensure least 14 day oral therapy experimental group . Patients eligible whether undergone valvular surgery . This imply surgery procedure prior randomisation heterogeneous , randomisation stratify requirement valvular surgery part treatment current episode IE .</detailed_description>
