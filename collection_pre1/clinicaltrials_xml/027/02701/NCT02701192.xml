	<detailed_description>Coccygodynia functionally limit painful disease conservative treatment provide mixed result . When proper surgical indication meet , result seem promise . However , lack data literature support surgical treatment . The case series report currently literature small retrospective ill-defined selection criterion . To date study prospectively follow patient undergo coccygectomy . This type study could accurately obtain data prospectively . This information help well guide clinician treatment disease . All patient see enrolled outpatient spine specialty clinic senior author . Patients meet inclusion criterion offer enrollment study third party ( clinical research assistant ) . Patients enrol complete pre-treatment SF-36 , Oswestry Disability Scale pain visual analog scale . Patients follow 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year treatment . Patients complete questionnaire contain VAS tolerable sit time visit SF-36 Oswestry disability scale complete one year post treatment .</detailed_description>
