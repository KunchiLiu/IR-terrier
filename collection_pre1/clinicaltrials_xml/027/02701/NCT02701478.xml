	<brief_summary>N2O use general anesthesia ( GA ) 100 year . It known anesthetic agent spar effect . But small know real analgesic effect GA . So far , way monitor pain GA base vital sign specific sensitive . Few device try evaluated pain GA last 2 decade . More recently , good device propose Physiodoloris device PMD200 device . The first offer index call ANI base heart rate variability ( HRV ) assessment . The second offer NoL index base analysis 5 parameter . The aim present study evaluate quantitatively analgesic index N2O GA use two index ANI NoL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : Assessment intraoperative analgesic effect 50 % /50 % Nitrous Oxide / Oxygen inhalation pain index ANI follow standardized electrical forearm stimulus patient undergo laparotomy general anesthesia intraoperative active epidural analgesia . Comparison new NoL analgesic index . Objectives : To observe variation intraoperative pain index ANI NoL classical standardize electrical stimulation forearm ( apply commonly use nerve stimulator use muscle relaxation monitoring ) different concentration inhale Nitrous Oxide ( N2O ) ( 0 % 50 % , concentration commonly use daily anesthesia ) . This allow quantification analgesic effect N2O . Study Design : Prospective , open label , observational descriptive study Subject Population : Adult patient schedule undergo abdominal surgery laparotomy general anesthesia active intraoperative epidural analgesia Sample Size : 40 patient evaluate study Study Duration : 1 year Study Center : Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital , Montreal , Quebec , Canada Adverse Events : None expect</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ASA status I , II III Patients age 18 70 year Laparotomy gynecological bowel surgery Duration type surgery require epidural analgesia via epidural catheter place prior general anesthesia induction arterial line place induction general anesthesia When 100 % O2 ventilation require anesthesia ( except induction phase patient receive O2 100 % ) . Patients receive intraocular injection gas ( SF6 , C3F8 , C2F6 ) within 3 month prior present surgery . Any condition internal entrap air could expand become dangerous , : head injury within 6 month prior surgery maxillofacial injury within 6 month prior surgery pneumothorax within 6 month prior surgery gas embolism within 6 month prior surgery decompression sickness within 6 month prior surgery bubble emphysema know patient middle ear , inner ear sinus surgery major abdominal distension/occlusion emergent surgery intestinal obstruction air inject epidural space determine placement needle epidural anesthesia ( saline use center loss resistance technique place catheter epidural space ) Any contraindication patient 's refusal epidural placement Unexpected difficult airway request excessive , possibly painful airway manipulation . Unexpected surgical complication require strong haemodynamic support ( transfusion , volume challenge , vasopressor , inotropic drug ) .</criteria>
