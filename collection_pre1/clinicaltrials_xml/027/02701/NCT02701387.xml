	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether implant thread design impact bone remodel and/or dental implant stability early healing period . The population study consist group subject interested replace two miss teeth dental implant . All implant site heal require bone augmentation placement standard 4 mm diameter implant . Subjects first undergo brief screen exam . If accept , comprehensive oral exam complete . Subsequently , enrol subject schedule dental surgery place implant ( ) . Subjects return weekly first 8 week placement brief post-operative appointment order conduct measurement study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design/Sample . This study prospective cohort study . The study sample derive patient present study site need least two dental implant satisfy criterion list . The study site project University California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Postgraduate Periodontics Implant Surgery Clinic . Implant surgery perform postgraduate periodontal resident program . Any resident involve study previous experience place dental implant . Also , resident , time , supervision attend faculty extensive experience dental implant surgery . The implant use study Easy ( EZ ) Plus AnyRidge . Both implant manufacture Megagen Implants United Kingdom ( UK ) currently market . The EZ Plus fixture feature `` conventional '' macroscopic thread design self-tapping thread four cut edge . The AnyRidge fixture feature unique knife-edge thread design . The company claim thread design result `` maximum bone implant contact ( BIC ) , maximize compressive force resistance minimize shear force production , '' thereby prevent drop stability immediate post-placement healing period . Both fixture manufacture material surface ( Super Resorbable Blast Media ( RBM ) Surface ) . Therefore , difference two implant macroscopic thread design . Potential implant site evaluate clinically radiographically determine amount location available bone placement dental implant ( ) . Implant sit deem appropriate bone height ( crest ridge vital anatomic structure mandibular nerve canal ) equal great length propose implant plus 2+mm ( margin safety ) . In case location without vital anatomic structure , bone height may equal length implant . The width available bone least 3mm great diameter propose implant ( i.e . least 1.5mm bone side implant ) . Thus , 4mm diameter implant require minimum 7mm width bone ( anterior-posterior mesial-distal ) . Finally , two implant may place next one another available bone meet criteria two implant ( i.e . two 4mm implant require 14mm bone 3mm bone implant ) . As example require minimum measurement two 4mm implant : ( 1.5mm + 4mm + 1.5mm ) + ( 1.5mm + 4mm + 1.5mm ) = 14mm . Following appropriate medical evaluation comprehensive clinical radiographic examination , treatment patient select study execute accord follow standardized protocol : 1 . Alginate polyvinyl siloxane ( PVS ) impression maxillary and/or mandibular arch 2 . Fabrication radiographic stent use [ material ] 3 . Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) scan ( J. Morita , 3D Accuitomo 170 ) implant site 4 . Fabrication computer generate guide use ( Megagen Anatomage InVivo 5 implant planning software ) 5 . Guided surgical placement dental implant ( ) use ( Megagen Anatomage Surgical Guide ) one-stage approach . The implant size ( diameter length ) determine individually base usual parameter implant selection . 6 . Resonance frequency analysis measurement use ( Osstell ISQ meter ) . These measurement do connect metal post top dental implant . This post connect ISQ meter resonate certain frequency provide operator numerical value correlate stability implant . Taking measurement harm patient implant way . This technology widespread use among clinician mean assess implant stability . 1 . Immediately placement 2 . Weekly first eight week Measuring implant stability quotient ( ISQ ) use resonance frequency analysis ( RFA ) consider `` standard care '' data technology collect , analyze publish , conceivable may become standard care procedure dental implant ( e.g . time implant placement period heal prior place implant restoration function ) . Whenever clinically acceptable , patient need one implant receive EZ Plus implant AnyRidge implant , thereby serve internal control . Implants may place adjacent one another and/or adjacent remain natural teeth . No site receive type implant-supported provisional restoration . All implant receive short healing abutment protrudes gingiva remain occlusion . For patient require two implant , type implant place first site determine coin flip . The second implant place automatically type . For patient require three implant , analogous process occur ( i.e . coin flip decide first , third , etc . implant type ; second , fourth , etc . automatically type ) . Data Collection . Data collect standardized , coded fashion . Data collection sheet store lock file cabinet study site . Data enter password-protected database . At completion study include analysis publication , data sheet destroy . Limitations . The limitation study include examine two macroscopic implant design . Conclusions draw study may guide future research project ultimate goal minimize eliminate transient drop implant stability follow implant placement establish protocol immediately load prosthesis base resonance frequency analysis .</detailed_description>
