	<brief_title>HeartLight : Heart Rate Monitoring Newborn Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 10 % newborns require form resuscitation birth . Heart rate ( HR ) sensitive indicator resuscitation efficacy . HR commonly estimate use stethoscope . However , simulation study show newborn healthcare provider estimate HR incorrectly 1/3 case . Common techniques monitoring heart rate electrocardiography ( ECG ) pulse oximetry ( PO ) develop resuscitation birth . ECG , establish accurate method monitoring HR , rarely used delivery room number reason include difficulty ensure adhesion skin ( baby wet/covered vernix ) skin damage premature baby cause strip electrode . Current ECG system also require 3 electrode position delay resuscitation . The usual site transmission PO foot hand . However , newborn baby , particularly require resuscitation HR low , blood flow reduce physiological mechanism preserve brain heart blood flow expense less important organ limbs . As consequence choice wavelength , difficult obtain reliable HR POs limb , typically obtain HR 1-2 minute . In delivery room , ECG PO system requirement cable connect main monitor . These get way recommend many baby delay cut umbilical cord ( ensure blood enters baby placenta ) often require baby resuscitate close mother even legs . The HeartLight system wireless optical sensor within custom newborn hat allow quick accurate HR monitoring . It compare ECG , PO electronic stethoscope determine accuracy reliability . The trial 4 phase ; Phase 1 evaluate thermal property hat , Phase 2 evaluate accuracy reliability HeartLight sensor baby within Neonatal Intensive Care Unit environment , Phase 3 evaluates HeartLight sensor newborn baby bear cesarean section Phase 4 evaluate performance HeartLight sensor baby gestation require resuscitation stabilisation birth . The investigator anticipate HeartLight sensor hat allow swift effective deployment , reduce delay resuscitation ( due use stethoscope ) improve HR accuracy ( result avoid error usual manual mental calculation make stressful environment delivery room ) need . However , additional benefit require significant modification exist care pathway resuscitation protocol , therefore potential barrier clinical uptake remove .</detailed_description>

Any infant resuscitation likely require . If multiple birth first baby bear shall recruit ( due resource limitation researcher attend birth ) Phase 4 : Infants &lt; 23 week Infants active resuscitation decide clinical team If multiple birth first baby bear shall recruit ( due resource limitation researcher attend birth ) Feedback : Unable obtain write informed consent</criteria>
