	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study well tremelimumab durvalumab without radiation therapy work treat patient small cell lung cancer return period improvement . Monoclonal antibody , tremelimumab durvalumab , may limit ability tumor cell grow spread enhance immune function . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving tremelimumab durvalumab together radiation therapy may lead improved clinical benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tremelimumab Durvalumab With Without Radiation Therapy Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ( progression free survival [ PFS ] objective response rate [ ORR ] ) combine immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy treatment relapse small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact antigen prim use radiation therapy ( XRT ) efficacy immune checkpoint inhibitor . II . To determine immune related objective response rate . III . To estimate overall survival measure time randomization death cause . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) /programmed cell death 1 ( PD1 ) expression pair tumor biopsy baseline , end cycle 2 time progression . II . To determine dynamic change cell free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( cfDNA ) immunophenotype peripheral blood repertoire circulate lymphocyte use multiparameter flow cytometry . III . To determine change circulate cytokine mediator inflammation immunity use Luminex assay . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive durvalumab IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve disease control may restart treatment upon evidence progressive disease , without confirmation . ARM II : Patients undergo radiation therapy daily 5 day 1 week 3 fraction every day 1 week receive treatment Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
