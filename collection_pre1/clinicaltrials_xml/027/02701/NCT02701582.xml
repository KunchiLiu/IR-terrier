	<brief_title>Goal-Directed Intraoperative Fluid Management Using FloTracÂ© Monitoring High-Risk Neurosurgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize ability ass volume status fluid responsiveness information gain Edwards FloTrac/EV1000 system couple goal-directed therapy fluid management algorithm make difference patient outcomes . Our specific aim : - Demonstrate goal-directed therapy ( GDT ) fluid management improve peri-operative fluid balance - Demonstrate GDT improve pulmonary function organ oxygenation - Demonstrate GDT reduce necessary therapeutic intervention peri- operative period - Demonstrate GDT reduce hypotensive episode peri-operative period Outcomes We study consequence goal-directed fluid therapy employ use dynamic indicator see FloTrac/EV1000 system measure follow : - Pulmonary status - Time extubation - Alveolar-arterial ( A-a ) gradient oxygen - Requirements supplemental oxygen - Organ oxygenation - Serum lactate - Arterial blood gas value ( pH , HCO3 , CO2 , O2 ) - Length stay ( LOS ) - In hospital , define time operation start eligibility discharge hospital accord surgeon accordance pre-define criterion - In ICU/PACU , define time operation end eligibility discharge intensive care accord attend intensivist accordance pre- define criterion - Fluid Balance - Inputs output ( I/Os ) measurable fluid ( i.e . blood , crystalloid , colloid ) peri-operative period , include duration intensive care next 24-48 hour completion surgery - Drugs administer fluid management ( i.e . mannitol , vasopressor ) - Pre-operative post-operative body weight twice-daily weight via bed weight - Hypotension - Number , duration severity ( i.e . minimum blood pressure ) hypotensive episode , define MAP &lt; 65</detailed_description>
