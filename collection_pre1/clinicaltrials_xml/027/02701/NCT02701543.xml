	<brief_summary>To compare two different Paclitaxel coat balloon treatment high grade stenotic occlude lesion Superficial femoropopliteal artery ( SFA ) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery Peripheral Artery Disease ( PAD ) patient Rutherford class 2-4 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare I Pilot Study Treatment Subjects With Symptomatic Femoropopliteal Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , multi-center 1:1 randomized trial . Patients stratify accord lesion length ( ≤ 10 cm/ &gt; 10 cm &lt; 20 cm / &gt; 20 cm ≤ 30 cm ) . Each stratum include approximately 138 patient . The trial investigate safety efficacy Ranger™ Drug Coated Balloon comparison IN.PACT™ Drug Coated Balloon patient symptomatic femoropoliteal artery disease . All enrol subject follow 24 month assess incidence restenosis ultrasound major adverse event ( MAE ) . Follow-up visit occur 1 , 6 , 12 24-month interval per local standard care . Up 414 patient enrol approximately 10-18 site Germany comparison follow two group : Treatment Ranger™ Paclitaxel Coated Balloon Catheter ( Boston Scientific Corporation , Natick , MA , USA ) vs. IN.PACT™ Drug Eluting Balloon ( Medtronic Inc. , Minneapolis , MI , USA ) .</detailed_description>
