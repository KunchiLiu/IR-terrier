	<brief_title>Compassionate Use MitoGel Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma ( UTUC ) rare malignant neoplasm arise urothelial line renal collecting system ureter . The current treatment paradigm UTUC involve endoscopic resection , technically feasible oncologically sound , complete resection kidney ureter ( nephroureterectomy ) case organ-sparing treatment feasible . Both organ-sparing complete resection option present significant technical clinical challenge . For patient bilateral disease , anatomic functionally solitary kidney , significant underlying medicorenal disease , treatment nephroureterectomy would result dialysis dependence , state carry significant risk 5-year mortality often elderly co-morbid patient population affect UTUC . MitoGel novel investigational product compose RTGel , unique hydrogel polymer exist liquid cold temperature viscous gel body temperature , Mitomycin C , clinically proven safe effective treatment urothelial carcinoma bladder . MitoGel instill upper urinary tract cold liquid , solidifies gel upon warm body temperature . The agent remain upper tract period 4-6 hour , result sustain contact tissue Mitomycin C. Preclinical study MitoGel Yorkshire swine demonstrate single serial instillation pelvicalyceal system via retrograde antegrade approach safe , observable adverse clinical , laboratory , histological effect . For reason , MitoGel generate interest treatment UTUC . For patient UTUC nephroureterectomy would result dialysis dependence , disease difficult manage endoscopically , currently available mean effectively deliver adjuvant chemotherapy upper tract . These patient thus either condemned treatment complete resection kidney resultant hemodialysis , risk progression disease incurable unmanageable state . MitoGel represent promise treatment option patient therapeutic option . For reason , MitoGel grant Orphan Designation Status FDA . While clinical trial MitoGel currently plan , trial open date . The aim study evaluate feasibility , safety , efficacy MitoGel treatment UTUC human subject low-grade UTUC endoscopically unresectable rapidly recur , nephrectomy would likely result need permanent hemodialysis . The study drug would obtain single patient access program approve FDA . The patient would undergo instillation MitoGel affect kidney . The catheter would leave indwelling ureter would externalize urethral catheter . The ureteral urethral catheter would remain indwelling duration 6 treatment , would occur twice weekly 3 week . Following final instillation , catheter would remove . The patient would undergo ureteroscopic evaluation 3 month follow final instillation MitoGel . The total duration study would 3 month . The total number study patient 1 .</detailed_description>
