There evidence long intervention effective short intervention . Brief cessation intervention show effective strong evidence investigator ' randomise control trial systematic review . The negotiate self-determination reduce cigarette consumption guide social cognitive self-determination theory . According social cognitive theory , self-efficacy important personal determinant human behaviour define belief one 's capability engage behaviour solve difficult task . This belief influence decision whether certain form behaviour adopt maintain . Because self-efficacy build successful experience overcome challenge task , smoker successful experience reduce cigarette consumption tend high level self-efficacy .

The subject study allow select schedule smoke reduction negotiation counsellor , percentage smoking reduction acceptable period time . It anticipate subject show willingness adhere schedule result increase autonomy . Moreover , evidence show autonomy positively associated competence ; , people great autonomy demonstrate high competence achieve behavioural change . Consequently , autonomy facilitate gradual reduction cessation smoking . Most importantly , result reduce cigarette consumption lower nicotine dependence , would much easy smoker reduce quit . Methods : Chinese patient attend general out-patient clinic Hong Kong routine follow-up visit fulfil follow inclusion criterion invite participate study . All smoking patient approach research assistant counsellor . The screening process allow investigator find smoker want quit smoker want reduce smoking . Analysis : Data analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Science . The investigator compare baseline characteristic patient x2 test categorical variable F-test continuous variable intervention control group . The investigator shall use x2 test ass effect intervention calculate crude odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) primary secondary outcome . The investigator shall conduct intention treat ( ITT ) analysis evaluation effectiveness .</detailed_description>
