	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Soft Tissue Sarcomas Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJCETIVES : I. Grade &gt; = 2 radiation morbidity ( subcutaneous tissue fibrosis , joint stiffness , edema ) 2 year . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate local control , regional control , distant metastasis , progression free survival , overall survival . II . Evaluate functional outcome assess use musculoskeletal tumor rating scale ( MSTS ) Toronto Extremity Salvage Score ( TESS ) . III . Collect germ-line deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) nucleic acid cancer patient investigate association identify new germ-line mutation impact cancer predisposition . IV . Investigate role germ-line mutation predict cancer outcome response therapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy Monday-Friday 5 day . Beginning 2-12 week completion radiation therapy , patient undergo surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
