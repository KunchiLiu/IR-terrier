	<brief_summary>Flexible bronchoscopy one widely perform procedure diagnosis various bronchopulmonary disease . Most patient tolerate procedure well although cough often report distress symptom . It likely acceptance bronchoscopy would significantly improve control cough . Use sedation bronchoscopy report improve procedure tolerance . However , awake ( sedation ) bronchoscopy routinely perform many centre include . Topical lignocaine administer bronchoscopy local anaesthesia . There limited literature efficacy low concentration ( 1 % ) versus high ( 2 % ) bronchoscopic procedure . This study would help determine whether 1 % lignocaine effective 2 % lignocaine airway anaesthesia flexible bronchoscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient meet inclusion criterion , demographic profile include age , sex , weight , smoke history type procedure perform bronchoscopy shall record . A write informed consent obtain participant . The patient undergo flexible bronchoscopy would randomise one one ratio either 1 % lignocaine 2 % lignocaine group . Prior bronchoscopy blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate pulse oximetry saturation record baseline Patients group shall prepare similar fashion except concentration lignocaine use . Two different concentration lignocaine solution label solution ' A ' solution ' B ' contain either 1 % 2 % lignocaine solution .Operator provide either solution A B base initial randomisation . During procedure , 1.5ml aliquot provide lignocaine solution deliver bronchoscope use spray-as-you go technique . The total number aliquot use procedure record . The patient would monitor adverse effect throughout procedure . The bronchoscopist procedure provide 2 VAS chart mark severity cough overall procedure satisfaction . Post procedure , patient record pain experience undergoing procedure face pain rating scale .</detailed_description>
