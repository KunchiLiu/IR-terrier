As extension standard mindfulness practice , investigator develop telephone-/web-delivered mobile mindfulness-based training ( mMBT ) system inform ICU survivor ' input could address medically ill patient ' delivery barrier . The investigator ' recent pilot study demonstrate early support mMBT 's feasibility acceptability , enhance content electronic patient-reported outcome capability . The investigator ' early work mMBT , promising , identify key knowledge gap population target , plausible range psychological distress estimate relevant study design , assurance acceptability must address definitive clinical trial conduct . Therefore , study team propose 2-year pilot study 90 ICU survivor randomize education control , 'standard ' telephone session mMBT , self-directed / app-based mMBT . A mixed method approach use determine treatment effect .</detailed_description>
