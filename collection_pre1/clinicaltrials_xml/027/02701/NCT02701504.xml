	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea prevalent disorder patient coronary artery disease . Previous study suggest sleep apnea associate coronary plaque burden future adverse cardiovascular event . Sleep apnea also associate high incidence atrial fibrillation patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting . Yet , previous report use Berlin Questionnaire Epworth Sleepiness Scale Questionnaire diagnose sleep apnea . However , screen questionnaire accurate proper sleep study . In SABOT study , investigator use portable sleep device diagnose sleep apnea , evaluate relationship sleep apnea cardiovascular outcome coronary artery bypass surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The SABOT Study observational study design study impact sleep apnea cardiovascular outcome non-urgent coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) . Patients age 18 90 schedule undergo non-urgent CABG eligible study Sleep Apnea Screening Questionnaire All recruit patient ask complete Berlin Questionnaire Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire . The Berlin Questionnaire validate screen tool use identify individual high risk sleep apnea . It consist 10 item three category , assess presence intensity snoring , severity daytime somnolence , presence hypertension obesity . A positive score two category indicate high risk sleep apnea . The Epworth Sleepiness Scale validate questionnaire identifies perceive likelihood fall asleep eight everyday situation . Patients ask rate likelihood fall asleep scenario scale 0-3 , total score range 0 24 . Excessive daytime sleepiness define Epworth Sleepiness Scale score &gt; 10 . Overnight Sleep Study The consenting participant schedule undergo hospital-based overnight sleep study use US Food Drug Administration-approved portable monitoring device : Watch-PAT ( Itamar Medical , Caesarea , Israel ) . Watch-PAT four-channel unattended sleep monitoring device measure peripheral arterial tone ( PAT ) , pulse oximetry , heart rate , actigraphy built-in actigraph . Respiratory event identify digital vasoconstriction mediate α-adrenergic receptor sensitive surge sympathetic activity . Respiratory event consider present one follow three criterion meet : reduction PAT amplitude acceleration pulse rate increase wrist activity ; reduction PAT amplitude ≥3 % oxyhemoglobin desaturation ; ≥4 % oxyhemoglobin desaturation . Although manual score edit Watch-PAT signal possible , adopted result generate device algorithm alone intervention operator . The diagnosis sleep apnea confirm AHI great 15 events/h . End Points The pre-specified primary end point major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event ( MACCE ) , define composite cardiovascular mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , non-fatal stroke , repeat revascularization . The secondary end point comprise sudden cardiac death resuscitate cardiac arrest , all-cause mortality , hospitalization heart failure .</detailed_description>
