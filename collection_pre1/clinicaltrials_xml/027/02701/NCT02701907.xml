	<brief_title>EXPRESS : EXcePtional RESponSe - Exceptional Unexpected Response Targeted Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint rate patient tumor harbor low level genomic alteration ( mutation , amplification deletion ) gene ( i.e . mutation , amplification , deletion ) identify causally implicated cancer . A low level genomic alteration define presence le 5th quantile genomic alteration expect give tumor type . Conversely , high level genomic alteration define presence 5th quantile genomic alteration expect give tumor type . The list gene alteration identify causally implicated cancer define Cancer Gene Census . This ongoing effort catalogue gene mutation , amplification deletion causally implicated cancer . It constantly update Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute ( UK ) available : http : //cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census ( n=571 gene September 2015 )</detailed_description>
