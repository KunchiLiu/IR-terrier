	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) one successful procedure orthopaedic surgery . Nevertheless , significant postoperative blood loss requirement blood transfusion still problematic . Total blood loss TKA divide visible invisible blood loss . Visible blood loss ( VBL ) mean blood loss surgical field wound drainage invisible blood loss ( IBL ) mean residual blood knee , extravasation tissue loss due haemolysis . In usual practice , TKA perform bloodless field use tourniquet . Thus intraoperative blood loss negligible postoperative drainage consider VBLvisible . In term IBL , Sehat et al . find TKA carry substantial IBL . Their result show mean IBL 765 ml 49 % mean total blood loss TKA . Therefore , true total blood loss underestimated take IBL account . Modified Robert Jones bandage ( MRJB ) bulky compressive dressing often use orthopaedic practice . Various technique application propose . From previous study , MRJB could make maintain anterolateral muscle compartment pressure least 24 hour TKA . Therefore , theoretically , bandage cause tamponade effect help reduce tissue edema postoperative bleeding especially IBL TKA . However potential benefit MRJB unclear use bandage TKA still controversy clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Modified Robert Jones Bandages Reducing Invisible Blood Loss After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In preoperative period , eligible participant admit hospital undergoing TKA . The detailed protocol , include rate visual analog pain score , time take blood check hematocrit level , criterion blood transfusion , time measure knee thigh circumference plan ambulation program , inform . The routine preoperative preparation do . The participant ask answer preoperative Oxford Knee Score questionnaire . Participants ' baseline characteristic also record . During intraoperative period , participant receive anesthetic method ( spinal anesthesia without morphine peripheral nerve block ) . Two experienced surgeon ( CK NR ) perform procedure surgical technique . A 750 mg intravenous tranexamic acid administrate inflate tourniquet 3 hour operation . A tourniquet pressure 300 mmHg use inflated skin incision . Pre-incisional local injection 10 ml 1 % lidocaine adrenaline do . A mini-medial parapatellar approach perform . Cemented TKA prosthesis ( Nexgen LPS-Flex , Zimmer , Warsaw , Indiana ) implant participant without patellar resurfacing . Periarticular analgesic injection do 20 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine , 20 ml normal saline , 30 mg ketorolac 1 ml 1 % lidocaine adrenaline . A number-10-gauge drain place intra-articularly connect Ultravak pressure drainage bottle ( Poly Medicure Limited , India ) . Extensor mechanism repair wound closure perform routine fashion . At end operation , randomize sequence open scrub nurse . Then , participant randomly assign two group ; Group 1 MRJB group Group 2 non-compressive dressing ( NCD ) group . A tourniquet pressure deflate dress apply . In postoperative period , MRJB leave place 24 hour change NCD . All participant obtain three-hour interval drain clamp protocol . After tourniquet release , drain clamp three hour , release three hour , re-clamped three hour , clamp run continuously . Mechanical prophylaxis deep vein thrombosis ankle pump exercise ambulation bed start soon possible . After 24 hour postoperatively , range motion exercise out-of-bed ambulation program start . Ice pack place around knee least 8 hour per day . The drain remove 48 hour operation . For operational definition , MRJB define three-layers thick cotton wool two-layers elastic bandage . The wool layer put firmly overlap previous one half turn . The elastic layer pull snugly tension distally proximally . Before wrap turn , elastic bandage stretch approximately 2 1.5 inch tibial tuberosity level , respectively . The whole bandage attain thickness two inch extend ankle joint six inch knee joint . Before apply bandage , sterile gauze pad place wound follow WebrilTM padding ( Covidien , Mansfield , MA , US ) . While NCD make place sterile gauze pad wound cover hypoallergenic self-adhesive , non-woven fabric tape . All patient receive postoperative pain management , include ( 1 ) parecoxib 40 mg administrate intravenous bolus every 12 hour 2 day , diclofenac 25 mg orally every 8 hour discharge , ( 2 ) acetaminophen 300 mg codeine 15 mg orally every 8 hour discharge , ( 3 ) morphine 2 mg intravenously pro nata ( prn ) pain every 2 hour rescue drug . During first second 24 hour surgery , maximum visual analog pain score rest ambulation assess . The circumference knee thigh postoperative 24 48 hour measure single blind assessor . To evaluate blood loss determine criterion blood transfusion , hematocrit level measure 24 48 hour surgery . The patient receive transfusion one unit pack red cell , hematocrit level less 30 % compromised clinical criterion ( hypotension , tachycardia , symptom anemia relative preoperative medical condition ) necessitate blood transfusion . If hematocrit level less 24 % , two unit pack red cell transfuse . The hematocrit level reevaluate 4 hour end transfusion blood transfusion consider use criterion . Drainage blood loss amount blood transfusion record 24 48 hour postoperatively . At discharge , range motion measure . Clinical venous thromboembolism , peroneal nerve palsy , infection wound complication also assess . During follow-up period , range motion , clinical venous thromboembolism , infection , wound condition complication reassess 2 6 week TKA . The functional outcome , include Oxford Knee Score time go test , evaluate 6 week postoperatively . Primary outcome study IBL . It mean invisible red blood cell ( RBC ) volume loss calculate accord follow step ; first , patient 's blood volume ( PBV ) calculate use Nadler formula . PBV = k1 x height ( ) 3 + k2 x weight ( kg ) + k3 When k1= 0.3669 , k2 = 0.03219 , k3 = 0.6041 men ; k1= 0.3561 , k2 = 0.03308 , k3 = 0.18331 woman Then , multiply PBV hematocrit ( Hct ) give total RBC volume . The change RBC volume calculate change Hct [ 20 ] . In study , total RBC volume loss postoperative 48 hour calculate use follow formula ; Total RBC volume loss = PBV x ( Preoperative Hct - Postoperative Hct 48 hour ) At 24 hour surgery , volume drain blood measure multiply preoperative Hct give drainage RBC blood volume 24 hour . During 24-48 hour surgery , volume drain blood measure multiply postoperative Hct 24 hour give drainage RBC blood volume 24-48 hour . The summation drainage RBC blood volume 24 hour 24-48 hour total drain RBC volume . If patient receives blood transfusion , volume pack red cell also record . Finally , invisible blood loss calculate use follow formula ; Invisible blood loss = Total RBC volume loss - Total drained RBC volume + Transfused blood volume</detailed_description>
