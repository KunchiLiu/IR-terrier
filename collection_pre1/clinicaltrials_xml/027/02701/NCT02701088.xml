	<brief_summary>Anal canal carcinoma ( ACC ) represent 1.2 % digestive cancer . Its incidence increase . As epidermoid ACC ( 95 % ACC ) particularly sensitive radio chemotherapy , concomitant radio-chemotherapy standard treatment locally advance ACC , proven efficacy locoregional control , anal sphincter preservation , progression-free survival complete response rate high 80 % . Nevertheless , conventional radiotherapy frequently induce significant non-haematological toxicity require treatment interruption . Thus , treatment usually include chemotherapy ( 5-Fluorouracil Mitomycine-C ) 25 fraction 1.8 Gy follow plan 1-week ( ) interruption boost , total 54-60 Gy radiation dose 9 week . Considering numerous anatomic pelvic structure , ACC become localisation interest Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) associate less toxicity . However , IMRT induce grade≥3 cutaneous toxicity require irradiation break . Dose escalade show interest : 60 Grays remain standard . Assuming deleterious effect increase overall treatment time local control survival head-and-neck cervical cancer epidermoid histology ACC , benefit irradiation break ACC tumour control interest . IMRT offer possibility deliver different dos different target volume simultaneously alter fractionation schedule like SIB-IMRT ( simultaneously integrate boost-IMRT ) . Several SIB-IMRT schedule retrospectively evaluate . Similar result observe moderate dos schedule deliver high dos short interruption . Nevertheless , standard SIB-IMRT schedule ACC still exist .</brief_summary>
