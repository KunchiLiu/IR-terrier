	<criteria>1 . Greater equal 55 year age 2 . At risk develop pressure ulcer time enrollment define one following : 1 . PU Risk Score Braden &lt; 15 ; Waterlow ≥ 10 ; Norton ≤ 18 2 . Poor mobility ; e.g. , Braden mobility subscore ≤ 2 ; Waterlow mobility subscore &gt; 2 ; Norton mobility subscore ≤ 2 ; poor mobility accord clinical judgment ( chair bedbound ) 3 . Poor nutrition ; e.g. , Braden nutrition subscore ≤ 2 ; Waterlow nutrition subscore &gt; 2 ; poor nutrition accord clinical judgment 4 . Medical procedure ( e.g . surgery , xray , etc . ) involve immobility inability change position last 4 hour longer 3 . Evaluable study team minimum 6 consecutive day upon enrollment 4 . Willing able provide inform consent ( proxy ) 1 . Unhealed ( include newly diagnose ) pressure ulcer anatomical site time enrollment 2 . Broken skin sacrum heel prevents collection SEM Scanner reading three anatomical location ; possible assessment one two location ground exclusion 3 . Moisture lesion incontinence associate dermatitis sacrum 4 . Physical , structural , limitation prevent assessment require study ( e.g. , suspect actual injury prevent turn ) 5 . Presence condition ( ) injury ( y ) compromise subject 's ability complete study 6 . Per clinical decision study Investigator , diminish decisionmaking capacity might impact compliance completion study procedures 7 . Patient modesty concern part subject ( proxy ) might impact collection SEM Scanner read anatomical location ( heel sacrum ) assess</criteria>
