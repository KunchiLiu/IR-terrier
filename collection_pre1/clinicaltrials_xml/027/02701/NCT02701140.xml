	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor reversibly bind , direct-acting , oral P2Y12 antagonist use prevention atherothrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome . It belong thienopyridines ; carbocyclic nucleoside , represent `` first-in-class '' cyclopentyl-triazolo-pyrimidine . In 2 phase II study , dyspnea note occur side effect ticagrelor dose-dependent fashion ; PLATO study , 6 % absolute excess dyspnea ticagrelor-treated patient compare patient treat clopidogrel . In ONSET/OFFSET study dyspnea commonly associate ticagrelor therapy comparison clopidogrel placebo patient stable coronary artery disease ( 38.6 % , 9.3 % , 8.3 % , respectively ) , associate study adverse change cardiac pulmonary function . This result confirm patient acute coronary syndrome . The mechanisms side effect largely unknown , although early data indicate ticagrelor block adenosine reuptake inhibition ENT-1 red blood cell , know intravenous adenosine infusion cause transient dyspnea absence bronchoconstriction . Another mechanism potentially increase adenosine level ticagrelor consist adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) release red blood cell . Moreover , comparison ticagrelor adenosine molecule suggest similarity ; Adenosine well-known key endogenous molecule regulate tissue function activate 4 G-protein-coupled adenosine receptor : A1 , A2A , A2B , A3 . Adenosine accumulate extracellular space response metabolic stress cell damage ; elevation adenosine find ischemia , hypoxia , inflammation , trauma . Adenosine act cytoprotector anti-inflammatory , cardioprotective , cerebroprotective , antisclerotic , antifibrotic property , well platelet inhibition vasodilation . It hypothesize chronic adenosine overload induce ticagrelor may contribute vascular outcome benefit observe PLATO , addition inhibitory effect platelet activity via P2Y12 receptor blockade . Very recently , ticagrelor show increase adenosine-induced physiological response human healthy subject shift dose-response curve adenosine-induced coronary blood flow velocity ( CBFV ) leave , non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patient treat percutaneous coronary intervention receive maintenance dose ticagrelor , coronary blood flow velocity augments great degree compare patient prasugrel maintenance dose response increase adenosine concentration . These effect also compatible adenosine reuptake blockage , another purport pleiotropic effect ticagrelor . The enhanced ticagrelor-related adenosine bioavailabilty may beneficial effect three interrelated mechanism . Activation preconditioning : Ischemic preconditioning , consist episode ischemia short 5 minute , follow reperfusion , show protect heart subsequent longer coronary artery occlusion markedly reduce amount necrosis . Adenosine play key role trigger ischemic preconditioning . Indeed , stimulation A1 adenosine receptor trigger complex pathway include epsilon isoform protein kinase C , ATP-dependent potassium channel , mitochondrial permeability transition pore well others , like paradoxical protective release oxygen radical eventually make cell resistant ischemia . In human , example precondition preinfarction angina angina `` warm-up phenomenon '' . Preconditioning reproduce experimentally repetitive balloon inflation coronary artery principal consequence less chest pain ST-segment elevation . Pharmacological preconditioning induce intravenous intracoronary administration adenosine A1 agonists adenosine . In recent study rabbit author observe anti-infarct effect clopidogrel cangrelor ( intravenous analog ticagrelor ) result blockade platelet aggregation , rather activation signal transduction pathway pre- postconditioning , involve reperfusion injury salvage kinase ( RISK ) include Akt ERK well adenosine A2B receptor , mitochondrial KATP channel , redox signalingi . This cardioprotective effect cangrelor confirm primate model . Improvement coronary microvascular dysfunction . Coronary microvascular dysfunction demonstrate affect prognosis patient acute coronary syndrome : Furber et al describe Doppler flow velocity parameter infarct-related artery prognostic value long-term cardiac event . Additionally , Takahashi et al . find impaired coronary flow reserve velocity ( CFVR ) infarct-related artery significantly associate increased cardiac event rate long-term follow-up . Furthermore , microvascular function demonstrate alter even non-ischemic region distance infarcted myocardial tissue van de Hoef et al . recently show microvascular dysfunction determine reference vessel percutaneous coronary intervention associate significantly increase long-term cardiac mortality . Microvascular dysfunction likely occur also set non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTEMI ) : Marzilli et al . find patient unstable angina , episode transient myocardial ischemia rest associate brisk increase coronary microvascular resistance increase prevent administration antiplatelet drug . Finally , microvascular dysfunction may also occur follow successful coronary angioplasty : coronary flow reserve show impaired vascular bed subtend treated artery require three month microvascular dysfunction resolve . Activation cellular preconditioning . Human bone marrow derive stem ( hBMDSC ) show remarkable therapeutic potential vitro vivo . The mechanism therapeutic benefit must multifaceted , involve enhanced expression , release trophic/growth factor provide autocrine paracrine modulation protection adult human myocardium stimulation endogenous regenerative response . However , class cell expose ischemic environment , reveal reduced survival rate impair angiogenic capacity . Exposure sub-lethal hypoxia might impair intracellular signal pathway involve regenerative process may provide resource several trophic agent growth factor might play important role cell survival , angiogenesis , differentiation hBMDSC . Recently , animal model myocardial infarction , P2Y12 blocker cangrelor show potent cardioprotective modulator mobilization progenitor cell protective signal myocytes smooth muscle cell rather effect platelet aggregation . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY Hypothesis The aim study assess pleiotropic effect ticagrelor could represent possible mechanism beneficial effect cardiovascular mortality . We test three different hypothesis : 1 . Ticagrelor may increase ischemic preconditioning compare clopidogrel patient stable coronary disease , show multivessel coronary artery disease undergo stag PCI . 2 . Ticagrelor may improve microvascular perfusion myocardium patient multivessel coronary artery disease undergo stag PCI . 3 . Ticagrelor may exert positive effect enhance paracrine modulation , migration , home survival hBMDSC , potential impact microvascular dysfunction protective response ischemia ( cellular preconditioning ) . Study design : The study prospective , randomize , open-label , blind end-point trial enroll patient multivessel , stable coronary artery disease undergo ischemia-related PCI ( evaluated stress test and/or FFR coronary catheterization ) , require stag PCI .
