	<brief_summary>In study , investigator examine effect low-dose ketamine different oculomotor , perceptual cognitive function . They also examine effect concurrent brain activity use blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . A sample N=25 healthy , male participant require complete study . The design within-subjects , placebo-controlled , double-blind cross-over . A targeted ketamine level plasma 100ng/ml apply . It hypothesise ketamine , compare placebo , lead change task performance brain activity similar observe patient schizophrenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist ketamine propose model system symptom schizophrenia . To complement model system allow neurobiological well translational study , biomarkers often applied people influence ketamine . Here , apply oculomotor , perceptual cognitive biomarkers healthy human volunteer whilst undergo BOLD fMRI 3 Tesla field strength . We use counter-balanced , placebo-controlled , double-blind , within-subjects design . A sample 25 healthy participant require . Participants receive intravenous ( IV ) racemic ketamine ( 100ng/ml target plasma concentration ) one two assessment day receive placebo ( intravenous saline ) assessment day . BOLD fMRI carry Siemens Trio scanner Life &amp; Brain Centre , Bonn . In addition brain functional cognitive , perceptual oculomotor response , also measure self-ratings psychosis-like experience . These obtain use Psychotomimetic States Inventory ( PSI ; Mason et al 2008 ) .</detailed_description>
