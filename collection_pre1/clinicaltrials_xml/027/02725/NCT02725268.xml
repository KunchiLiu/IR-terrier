	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study MLN0128 , Combination MLN0128 With MLN1117 , Paclitaxel Combination MLN0128 With Paclitaxel Women With Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug evaluate study MLN0128 MLN1117 . MLN0128 evaluate single agent combination paclitaxel MLN1117 treat woman advance , recurrent , persistent endometrial cancer . This study evaluate efficacy safety drug drug combination . The study enroll approximately 260 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one 4 treatment group : - Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 weekly - Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 weekly + MLN0128 4 mg 3 consecutive day week - MLN0128 30 mg weekly - MLN0128 4 mg + MLN1117 200 mg give 3 consecutive day week Participants receive either Paclitaxel intravenous ( IV ) weekly , Paclitaxel IV along MLN0128 orally , MLN0128 orally , MLN0128 MLN1117 orally . This multicenter , multinational trial . Participants make multiple visit clinic , end treatment visit ( EOT ) occur 30 40 day receive last dose study drug start subsequent anticancer therapy . After EOT , participant follow PFS overall survival ( OS ) .</detailed_description>
