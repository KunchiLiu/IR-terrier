	<detailed_description>Cardiogoniometry technique process evaluate vectorcardiography regular ECG acquisition . Vectorcardiography long tradition cardiology provide comprehensive information myocardial function integrity . Compared standard electrocardiography , vectorcardiography show sensitive detect structural ischemic heart disease . Unfortunately , interpretation vectorcardiography complex hinder widespread application . In recent year , computer assist analysis allow automated interpretation vectorcardiography promise result comparison standard ECG identifying patient ischemic heart disease . However , underlie mechanism threshold alter cardiac vector presence coronary artery disease well understood . This research aim explore relationship computer assist analysis vectorcardiography presence , extent , severity , location coronary artery disease comparison standard ECG evaluation . Furthermore , investigator intent follow enrolled patient occurrence adverse cardiovascular event correlation test finding . These data provide comprehensive information diagnostic performance noninvasive , inexpensive evaluation cardiac vector loop identify patient risk coronary artery disease . Specifically , study aim : 1 . Compare diagnostic accuracy cardiogoniometry standard ECG detect coronary artery disease assess CT angiography 2 . Investigate relationship abnormal cardiogoniometry finding extent/severity/location coronary artery disease CT angiography 3 . Compare intermediate term prognosis patient accord cardiogoniometry , standard ECG , CT finding</detailed_description>
