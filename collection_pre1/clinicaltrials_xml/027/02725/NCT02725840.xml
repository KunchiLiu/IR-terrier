	<brief_summary>Through improve early detection treatment , number long term breast cancer survivor continue increase . There 2.8 million breast cancer survivor U.S. Florida alone add 9,000 woman survivorship pool year . Most receive radiation treatment ( RT ) affect breast chest wall reduce risk recurrence . Even advanced radiation technique dose conformality minimize exposure highly sensitive lung , 14 % breast cancer patient treat radiation develop clinical pulmonary toxicity , 4 % overall experiencing high grade clinical toxicity . Early diagnosis intervention mitigate lung radiation toxicity increasingly important long term care survivor . The investigator ' goal well identify breast cancer patient high risk experience severe pulmonary toxicity require medical intervention , provide mean identify toxicity early , tailor treatment and/or early intervention per-patient basis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project involve repeat chest compute tomography ( CT ) image blood draw subject breast cancer radiation treatment affect breast chest wall . The investigator study woman receive one 2 type radiation , either conventional X-rays ( IMRT ) proton University Florida Health Proton Therapy Institute ( UFHPTI ) . These subject typically would receive follow-up chest CTs per standard care . All subject receive pre-treatment chest CT scan part treatment planning process . The investigator enroll 30 subject X-ray treatment group 25 subject proton group . The investigative team recently solve technical challenge extract characterize lung vascular anatomy clinical CT image chest used tool characterize acute chronic change pulmonary vascular structure breast cancer patient receive radiation chest wall treatment cancer . In Aim 1 study investigator compare lung vascular damage woman treat conventional radiation treat UFHPTI . In Aim 2 use blood sample subject Aim 1 investigate differential role inflammatory cytokine initiation progression pulmonary vascular radiation response conventional versus proton radiation exposure . Aim 3 compare vascular damage clinical pulmonary function assessment use spirometry diffusion capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) . Aim 4 tie together Aims 1-3 employ extend exist mathematical model radiobiological response improve solidify scientific understand biological mechanism radiation response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women least 18 year age . Women Stage II high primary breast cancer schedule receive conventional Xray RT ( n=30 ) proton therapy ( n=25 ) breast chest wall . Patients willing able submit repeat chest CT scan inject vascular contrast blood draw . Pregnant woman . Patients previously radiation treatment portion lung receive great 5 Gy radiation exposure . Women bilateral breast cancer metastatic disease site near chest additional radiation exposure portion lung great 5 Gy anticipate . Women allergic reaction common CT contrast agent .</criteria>
