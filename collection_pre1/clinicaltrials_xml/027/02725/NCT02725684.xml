	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether use genomics help identify patient specific treatment choice cancer . In order test , investigator plan use genomic sequencing technology identify patient specific mutation glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) compare normal cell identify mutation . Further analysis identify potential treatment target whether drug could use particular mutation . Follow clinical data assess see individualized method choose treatment option improve clinical outcome patient GBM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study ass whether use genomics identify patient specific treatment choice glioblastoma ( GBM ) improve clinical outcome standard care . GBM devastate disease , common primary brain tumor aggressive . With current standard therapy , include surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy temozolomide , median survival 14.6 month . Once patient fail temozolomide , proven therapy , although chemotherapy , bevacizumab , tyrosine kinase inhibitor often try . Because tumor different patient , outcome vary among patient . For example , temozolomide , though recommended patient GBM chemotherapy improve survival , also know effective patient o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase ( MGMT ) unmethylated tumor . This example underscore idea tumor different , perhaps would better outcome tumor treat uniquely . Genomic sequence technology employ identify specific characteristic tumor compare healthy cell . Since 2008 , genomic sequence technology advance significantly , enter era next generation sequencing , simultaneously , cost use technology dramatically decrease , near cost currently use diagnostic test MRI . In study , investigator plan assess usefulness technology analysis method guide treatment choice individual patient GBM . The investigator plan sequence tumor/normal GBM patient identify mutation . The mutation analyze potential drug target treatment recommendation treatment suggest identify . If clinician implement recommendation , clinical follow data collect . The investigator compare clinical outcome , survival historical control undergo standard care treatment ass whether genomic guide , individualized therapy determination improve measure . In addition , investigator plan use next generation sequence method determine whether presence brain messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) miRNA detect peripheral blood whether biological relevance presence detect .</detailed_description>
