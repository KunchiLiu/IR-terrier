	<brief_title>ArthroPlanner : A Surgical Planning Solution Acromioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Subacromial impingement rotator cuff anterior [ 1 ] lateral acromion [ 2 ] superior humeral head common disorder . This condition arise subacromial space height narrow active elevation scaption arm shoulder level due abnormal hook shape large lateral extension acromion . In severe case impingement syndrome , arthroscopic acromioplasty surgery usually perform resect different area acromion cause damage subacromial structure . The exact location amount bone resect generally leave unique appreciation orthopedic surgeon surgery . To improve precision resection , surgeon could greatly benefit surgical planning solution aim provide precise information surgical procedure . Moreover , since subacromial impingement result dynamic mechanism , effective planning solution analyze morphological joint 's structure dynamic behavior shoulder movement fully apprehend patient joint 's condition . Computer-assisted planning solution `` ArthroPlanner '' acromioplasty nowadays available . The solution allow perform standard morphological bony measurement , well 3D simulation patient 's joint everyday shoulder activity . The software compute precise bone resection ( location amount ) base detect subacromial impingement motion . The goal study thus compare clinical radiological result superior rotator cuff repair without computer-assisted planning . The hypothesis preoperative planning acromioplasty would allow accurate bone resection , would decrease postoperative impingement consequently improve postoperative range motion tendon heal . Methods We reconstruct bones patient 's shoulder joint ( scapula humerus humeral head mid-shaft ) CT image use Mimics software ( Materialise NV , Leuven , Belgium ) . The bone import ArthroPlanner software follow step perform : First , generic bone model produce use template fitting approach deform bone template optimize topology ( one scapula one humerus ) reconstruct bone . This allow u next step exploit anatomical correspondence automatize landmarks point selection mesh . Second , biomechanical parameter compute permit motion description glenohumeral joint . The glenohumeral joint center automatically calculate sphere fit technique [ 3 ] fit sphere humeral head use point proximal humerus model . Bone coordinate system establish scapula humerus . base definition suggest International Society Biomechanics [ 4 ] use anatomical landmark define bone model . Missing landmarks lateral medial epicondyle identify CT image . Third , morphological measurement perform analyze individual shoulder anatomy . The Critical Shoulder Angle [ 5 ] Î² angle [ 6 ] calculate , criterion associate rotator cuff tear . The angle compute 3D base bony landmark , necessary , interactively adjust user manipulate 3D handle viewer . Fourth , motion apply time step humerus model real-time evaluation impingement . The minimum humero-acromial distance typically used evaluation subacromial impingement measure [ 7 ] . This distance calculate millimeter base simulated bone model position . A color scale also use map variation distance scapula surface ( red color = minimum distance , color = area increase distance ) . Given thickness potential impinged tissue , subacromial impingement consider compute humero-acromial distance &lt; 6 mm , suggest literature [ 7 ] . To test wide variability realistic movement , motion database daily activity ( e.g. , cross arm , comb hair ) use addition standard kinematic sequence ( e.g. , elevation , scaption ) . Finally , acromial resection plan define base 3D simulation result . A color map use represent area impingement occur acromion humerus ( Fig . 1D ) . The red color denote area small humero-acromial distance compute different motion simulation . The result step planning procedure carefully validate user continue next one . At end planning , PDF report generate contain patient 's information measurement perform . The bone simulation data also export used simple 3D viewer ( Fig . 2 ) dedicate surgeon . With viewer , surgeon able play simulation , observe impingement dynamically review resection plan .</detailed_description>
