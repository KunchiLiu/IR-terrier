	<brief_summary>Although cochlear implant restore hearing individual lose cochlear hair cell function , adequately effective treatment individual suffer chronic imbalance , postural instability unsteady vision due loss vestibular hair cell function . Preclinical study demonstrate electrical stimulation vestibular nerve via chronically implant multichannel vestibular prosthesis partially restore vestibular reflex maintain steady posture vision . This pilot clinical feasibility study multichannel vestibular implant system evaluate approach ten human subject bilateral vestibular deficiency due gentamicin ototoxicity cause inner ear dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multichannel Vestibular Implant Early Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The system use study ( MVI ) ™ Multichannel Vestibular Implant System produce Labyrinth Devices , LLC . It similar commercially available cochlear implant include implanted stimulator power controlled external unit , communicate implant across skin via inductive link . Unlike cochlear implant , implant stimulator 's electrode array design implantation near end vestibular nerve . The implanted stimulator also include additional magnet help facilitate retention external unit scalp implant . The external unit include head-worn unit ( sense head motion deliver power signal implant stimulator ) power control unit contain battery microprocessor . Participants trial meet candidacy criterion choose proceed implantation surgery , device activation device deactivation ask participate series post-operative monitoring visit 1 year period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adults age 22.090 bilateral vestibular deficiency responsive vestibular rehabilitation determine preinclusion history , vestibular test clinical examination 2 . Hearing status : ( 1 ) Hearing candidate ear implantation equivalent bad contralateral ear ; ( 2 ) hear contralateral ear good enough allow functional communication case hearing implant ear lose implantation . Specifically , contralateral ear must satisfy follow criterion : 1 . 0.5/1/2/4 kilohertz ( kHz ) puretoneaverage threshold ( PTA ) hearing well ( i.e. , less ) 70 dB hearing loss ( HL ) ; 2. earspecific sentence recognition score use record AzBio Sentence Test present 60 dB sound pressure level A ( SPLA ) quiet must &gt; 60 % test either unaided condition , 0.5/1/2/4 kHz PTA &gt; 50 dB , bestaided condition ; 3. earspecific word recognition score use record ConsonantNucleusConsonant ( CNC ) Word Recognition Test present 60 decibel hear level ( dB HL ) quiet must &gt; 60 % test either unaided condition , 0.5/1/2/4 kHz PTA &gt; 50 dB , bestaided condition 3 . Caloric response consistent severe profound bilateral loss labyrinthine function ( total caloric response warm cool caloric stimulus &lt; 10°/sec ear ; lack reversal response icewater caloric stimulation subject reorients supine prone ) 4 . Prior MRI image brain , internal auditory canal cerebellopontine ( CP ) angle show patent labyrinth , present vestibular nerve , patent cochlea , present cochlear nerve , absence internal auditory canal/cerebellopontine angle tumor central cause vestibuloocular reflex dysfunction sensorineural hearing loss 5 . Prior CT image temporal bone show facial nerve canal normal caliber course , middle ear without evidence chronic otitis medium tympani membrane perforation cholesteatoma , mastoid cavity adequate aeration surgical access semicircular canal , skull thickness ≥3 mm plan well site , scalp soft tissue thickness ≤7 mm . This criterion may satisfy without additional imaging exist head CT MRI already demonstrate finding 6 . Vaccinations recommend per Johns Hopkins Listening Center protocols reduce risk meningitis subject undergoing cochlear implantation , describe site : http : //www.hopkinsmedicine.org/otolaryngology/specialty_areas/listencenter/vaccine.html 7 . Motivated travel study center , undergo test examination require investigational study , participate actively vestibular rehabilitation exercise regimen 8 . The participant must agree swim use operate vehicle , heavy machinery , power tool device could pose threat participant , others , property throughout duration participation study least 1 month final deactivation MVI Implant 1 . Inability understand procedures potential risk involve determined study staff 2 . Inability participate study procedure due blindness , ≤ ±10° neck range motion , cervical spine instability , ear canal stenosis malformation sufficient prevent caloric test 3 . Diagnosis acoustic neuroma/vestibular schwannoma , chronic middle ear disease , cholesteatoma , central nervous system cause vestibuloocular reflex dysfunction , include chronic continue use medication , drug alcohol dos sufficiently great interfere vestibular compensation 4 . Vestibular dysfunction know caused reason labyrinthine injury due ototoxicity , ischemia , trauma , infection , Meniere 's disease , genetic defect know act hair cell 5 . Lack labyrinth patency vestibular nerve determine MRI brain attention internal acoustic meatus 6 . Any contraindication plan surgery , anesthesia , device activation deactivation , participation study assessment , determine surgeon , anesthesiologist , designee , include know intolerance material use component investigational device come contact subject 7 . History myocardial infarction , coronary bypass surgery , percutaneous coronary intervention within 6 month prior screen 8 . Subjects estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 ml/min screen 9 . Subjects heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV 10 . Subjects ChildPugh class C cirrhosis 11 . A psychiatric disease substance abuse history likely interfere protocol compliance 12 . Contraindications scleral coil eye movement test , include monocular blindness history faint vagal reaction prior eye manipulation would exclude subject eye coil test 13 . Inability tolerate baseline testing protocols 14 . Recent corneal injury 15 . A history cervical spine disease prevent head rotation 16 . A history faint vagal reaction prior eye manipulation would preclude 3D eye movement coil test 17 . Pregnancy , positive urine serum pregnancy test time study participation , 18 . Ability become pregnant combined failure refusal consistently use highly effective method contraception least 1 month prior implantation 1 month device deactivation conclusion study participation . 19 . Women nursing/lactating 20 . Any medical condition , judge investigator team , likely interfere study candidate 's participation study likely cause serious adverse event study .</criteria>
