	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Locally Advanced Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) way produce tissue necrosis light prior administration photosensitize agent . The important advantage include possibility combine PDT target therapy repeat process need favorable outcome . The combination diverse therapeutic modality one new strategy enhance oncologic treatment pancreatic cancer . In order overcome limitation treatment modality prevent development resistance , application PDT combine target therapy , without increase toxicity patient , widely investigate . PDT extensively study treatment various superficial skin cancer Europe available United States Japan due overlap treatment field . In Korea , use first-generation second-generation photosensitizers part study Gastroenterology , Dermatology , Otolaryngology , Gynecology . Recently , although investigator introduce PDT use novel photosensitizers yet use treatment pancreatic cancer . This study aim determine safety efficacy photodynamic therapy novel photosensitizer locally advance hilar cholangiocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
