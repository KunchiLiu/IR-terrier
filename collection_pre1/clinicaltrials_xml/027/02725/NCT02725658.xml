	<brief_title>Monitoring Predicting Breast Cancer Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response Using DOSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There considerable interest develop image protocol monitor predict breast cancer response neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) , chemotherapy give surgical removal tumor , prior early possible course treatment . The efficacy practicality conventional imaging approach NAC set varies identifies need alternate functional imaging strategy . Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging ( DOSI ) experimental image method allow patient follow treatment cost-effective , bedside , handheld scan probe . DOSI non-invasive technology develop University California , Irvine Beckman Laser Institute . Studies perform seven clinical site approximately 200 suspect breast cancer patient , 150 expect undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) . As primary aim , investigator evaluate whether DOSI predict NAC pathologic complete response ( pCR ) , define tumor cell leave resected tissue surgery ) mid-point therapy regimen . As non-invasive DOSI obtain rapidly risk/discomfort , experimental imaging modality could use indicator pathologic response establish indicator long-term survival . The investigator long-term goal provide oncologists relatively simple , risk-free bedside tool use help inform medical decision chemotherapy regimen , duration , time surgery , thereby maximize therapeutic response minimize unnecessary toxicity .</detailed_description>
