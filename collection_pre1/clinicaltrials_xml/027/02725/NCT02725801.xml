	<brief_title>Comparison One-port Two-port Tissue Expanders Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study compare traditional single port expander two-port expander equivalency use breast reconstruction follow mastectomy . Complication rate track include seroma , mastectomy skin flap necrosis , infection , wound dehiscence , need explantation expander . Management seromas compare two group . The investigator hypothesize AlloX2 expander effective achieve final outcome completion second stage reconstruction equal improve complication rate . Study Design A prospective 1:1 randomize , single center , open label study compare traditional 1- port tissue expander AlloX2 2-port expander place immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction . Due nature surgery , study blind . Patients follow completion expansion exchange permanent implant typically take 2 3 month . Risks factor previously identify associate increased postoperative complication include smoking , obesity , breast size , diabetes , radiation therapy , expander fill volume identify . The final outcome completion expansion exchange permanent implant . Standard operative procedure postoperative care do . Both group two external drain place standard operative procedure . Complications note postoperative clinic visit enter database . Complication rate compare two group association risk factor analyze . There cross-over group case reconstructive failure . Treatment failure treat fashion two group .</detailed_description>
