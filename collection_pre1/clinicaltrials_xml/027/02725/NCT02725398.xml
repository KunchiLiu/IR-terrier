	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal cancer develop serious health problem China . 80 % -90 % patient detect middle later stage . The five-year survival rate advance cancer patient less 10 % . The main reason bad clinical diagnosis treatment present technical method difficult achieve early diagnosis . Endoscopy biopsy still main method confirm gastrointestinal cancer . But limit identify early tumor lead low diagnostic rate early tumor poor overall therapeutic effect . Confocal laser endoscopy ( CLE ) obtain pathologic information lesion real time improve diagnostic rate early tumor . Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) new technology recently . Since laser probe applicable conventional endoscope , pCLE greatly increase clinical application . However , gastrointestinal motility greatly influence pCLE image quality inspection effect owe poor stability small probe manipulation . Scopolamine ( 654-2 , China ) clinically use inhibit bowel peristalsis , effect still ideal side effect common .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Buscopan Gastrointestinal Imaging Quality With Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buscopan effectively relieve gastrointestinal spasm , side effect few . It report Buscopan effectively relieve gastrointestinal spasm , facilitate scope insertion improve patient ' comfort endoscopy.Buscopan may make endoscopic physician observe easily effectively improve diagnostic rate . Buscopan may effectively inhibit duodenum motility facilitate ERCP operation.It report literature whether Buscopan use pCLE examination improve image quality detection accuracy lesion . Hence , investigator plan develop prospective , double-blind , randomize , control study , effect Buscopan gastrointestinal image quality diagnosis accuracy probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy , order confirm practical application value Buscopan pCLE examination . Patient selection , group , operate process : Subjects select base inclusion exclusion criterion volunteer eligible trial inpatient outpatient apply pCLE examination endoscopy center Xijing Digestive Disease Hospital . Patients divide three group : Buscopan ( BSP ) , Scopolamine ( 654-2 ) physiological saline ( NS ) control group , accord ratio 1:1:1 . Operators blind random grouping , patient unclear accept Buscopan , 654-2 NS drug operation . All endoscopy operation complete clinical experienced endoscopists ( WKC LSH ) use gastroscopy、 colonoscopy enteroscopy , respectively GIF-H260、CF-H260、SIF-260 ( Olympus Medical Systems , Tokyo , Japan ) . Operating process : Preoperative preparation basically conventional endoscopy.Patients ingest mucosal surface anesthesia defoaming agent 30 minute endoscopy , accept fluorescein sodium allergy test intravenously ( 2 % , 1 ml ) 20 minute endoscopy , establish venous pathway . Negative patient could accept pCLE examination . First use standard white light observe , record spasm score , observe lesion . It administer endoscopic nurse respectively Buscopan ( BSP , 20mg ) , Scopolamine ( 654-2,10mg ) , physiological saline ( NS ) , record blindly . Then inject 10 % fluorescein sodium 5ml ( Guangzhou Baiyun Shan Ming Xing Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. ) intravenously , start button scan pCLE . To scan order back endoscopy , indicate observation position pCLE , target biopsy pCLE meet lesion . During examination , spasm score ( 2 minutes,20 minute administer drug ) operation time record . Visual analogue scale ( visual field stability patient comfort ) level give examination . To record whether related complication happen positively process . To evaluate quality image accord Kiesslich pCLE image quality analysis method diagnostic accuracy combine pathologic diagnosis ( target biopsy , pathological examination , comparative calculation ) .</detailed_description>
