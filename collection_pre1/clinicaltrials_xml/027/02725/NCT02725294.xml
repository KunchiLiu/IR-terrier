	<detailed_description>Prompt treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) exacerbations oral steroid and/or antibiotic , ideally within 3 day onset symptom , decrease severity duration exacerbation may reduce risk COPD hospitalization . This observational study examine Veterans ' care-seeking behavior focus patient ' perceive need care perceived access care whether factor delay seek care COPD exacerbation , increase risk hospitalization . This study also evaluate one approach identify early exacerbation use remote inhaler monitoring system . This observational cohort study enroll 410 Veterans COPD high-risk exacerbation follow every patient 1 year . The Specific Aims : 1 ) Examine barrier seek care COPD exacerbation worsen breathing ; 2 ) Test use real-time remote inhaler monitor identify early exacerbation . All participant attend one in-person baseline visit complete spirometry baseline questionnaire . Participants contact every 2 week 1 year use interactive voice response system screen COPD exacerbation 4 yes/no question . Participants positive screen call back research staff obtain additional detailed information exacerbation treat . Data analysis examine access care baseline factor associate delay treatment . The 410 participant enrol two site : VA Puget Sound Seattle , WA VA Eastern Colorado Denver , CO. For Aim 1 , approximately 60 participant report COPD exacerbation ( either hospitalize , see emergency department , treat outpatient , seek treatment ) participate in-depth semi-structured interview train research staff understand respond worsening symptom decide whether seek care . When available , caregiver Veterans interview obtain perspective exacerbation event . In Aim 2 , 200 participant Aim 1 use inhaler monitor albuterol inhaler 12-month follow-up period , transmit data real-time daily inhaler use . Data analysis measure ability change albuterol use predict patient report COPD exacerbation determine appropriate cut-offs use future intervention trial . These aim provide detailed information best intervene ensure prompt identification treatment COPD exacerbation . New health care delivery approach assist Veterans early identification exacerbation provide early access care integrate VA primary care , emergency medicine pulmonary specialty care setting .</detailed_description>
