	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , active-controlled , multicenter , parallel-group Phase 3 study safety efficacy tanezumab administer SC injection 56 week subject chronic low back pain . Approximately 390 subject randomize 1 3 treatment group 1:1:1 ratio ( ie , 130 subject per treatment group ) . Treatment group include : 1 ) Placebo SC match tanezumab administer 8-week interval ( total 7 time ) plus celecoxib 100 mg twice day ( BID ) administer orally 56 week ; 2 ) Tanezumab 5 mg SC administer 8-week interval ( total 7 time ) plus placebo matching celecoxib administer orally BID 56 week ; 3 ) Tanezumab 10 mg SC administer 8-week interval ( total 7 time ) plus placebo matching celecoxib administer orally BID 56 week . The study design total duration ( post-randomization ) 80 week consist three period : Screening ( 37 day ; include Washout Period Initial Pain Assessment Period [ IPAP ] ) , Double-blind Treatment Period ( 56 week ) Follow-up Period ( 24 week ) . The Screening Period ( begin 37 day prior Randomization ) include Washout Period ( last 2 32 day ) , require , IPAP ( 5 day prior Randomization/Baseline ) . Prior enter study , subject must experience benefit ( eg , analgesic effect ) current stable dose regimen oral NSAID ( celecoxib , loxoprofen meloxicam ) treatment , tolerate NSAID regimen , take medication regularly ( defined average least 5 day per week ) 30 day period prior Screening Visit .</detailed_description>
