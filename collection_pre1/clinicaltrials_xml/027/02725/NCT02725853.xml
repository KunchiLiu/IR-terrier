	<brief_summary>Many people stroke problem recover use affect arm problem may persist long time . The investigator ' research test new way boost recovery use non-painful brain stimulation together train arm movement use basic science principle . The training program do use late technology rehabilitation virtual reality robotics . The investigator compare three group patient stroke . Each group receive different combination brain stimulation arm training . Another aspect proposal investigator train program three different country - Canada , Israel India . In way , investigator combine knowledge skill create train program apply anywhere world necessarily limit high-income country . Also , combine expertise , investigator help build capacity research India , middle-income country great potential contribute new knowledge rehabilitation medicine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Training approach base establish principle motor learn neural plasticity non-invasive brain stimulation repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) show promise modulate brain activity order enhance upper limb ( UL ) motor recovery . However , potential recovery may still attain train program specifically focus remediate motor impairment define motor control science . This project drive major theory motor control ( Threshold Control Theory ) suggest rather directly specify motor command muscle , descend system regulate spatial threshold ( STs ) reflexes generate control voluntary movement within specific area joint space . In patient stroke , ST control diminish lead appearance muscle spasticity , weakness abnormal muscle activation pattern voluntary movement within well-defined spatial ( angular ) zone . The investigator hypothesize recovery voluntary motor control tightly link recovery threshold control . The investigator propose train program incorporates personalize tDCS balance cortical hypo/hyperexcitability well personalized movement arm reach training base identification disorder ST . Overall objective proposal : 1 . To test effectiveness personalized training program increase range regulation STs elbow reach . 2 . To determine effect repetitive tDCS aim inhibit excessive/exciting diminished cortical activity . 3 . To determine feasibility implement personalized training program high low-to-middle income country . Sixty patient sub-acute ( 3 wks-6 mo ) stroke recruit multi-site international trial take place Canada , Israel India . Participants spasticity elbow flexor and/or extensor , active elbow control . Each site recruit randomize patient one 3 treatment group . Group 1 receive tDCS practice personalize arm motor training . Group 2 also receive tDCS non-specific practice . Group 3 receive Sham-tDCS personalized practice . Training consist application tDCS first 30 minute 50-minute arm reaching practice session , , 5 day per week 2 week . Primary outcome measure ( Pre , Post , Follow-up ) elbow flexor extensor STs relate spasticity/active control zone . Secondary measure clinical measure UL motor activity . By account spatial structure motor deficit , research benefit researcher clinician advance understanding mechanism underlie unimpaired/impaired motor control recovery .</detailed_description>
