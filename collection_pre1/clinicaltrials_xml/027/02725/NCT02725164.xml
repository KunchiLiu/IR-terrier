	<brief_title>Anesthetic Gas Leakage Children During Tonsillectomy : Comparison Cuffed Uncuffed Tracheal Tubes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For past 6 decade , uncuffed tube use child less 8 year age fear cuff tube would cause damage subglottic region . The correct size uncuffed tube create seal subglottis minimal pressure mucosa . However , cuff tubes become widely used child recently without cause damage mucosa . There little literature compare magnitude gas leak cuff uncuffed tracheal tube particularly child . Several author suggest leak nitrous oxide sevoflurane uncuffed tubes much great cuffed tube . One important poorly study issue risk airway fire cautery use tonsillectomy large leak oxygen mouth could ignite fire . It also remain unclear whether mode ventilation , spontaneous control , affect leak gas mouth . One might expect gas leak spontaneous ventilation less controlled ventilation , may matter context small concentration oxygen sevoflurane investigator use . To address concern , investigator design study compare concentration gas ( oxygen , carbon dioxide , nitrous oxide sevoflurane ) oral cavity child undergo T &amp; A either cuffed uncuffed tube , spontaneous control ventilation .</detailed_description>
