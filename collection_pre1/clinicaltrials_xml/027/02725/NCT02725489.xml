	<brief_summary>Combining Vigil™ Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) allow Vigil™ increase infiltration activate T cell tumor , addition , enhance PD-L1 ( program cell death ligand 1 ) expression . Consequently , response rate historically unresponsive PD-L1 negative cancer Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) reach level similar achieve PD-L1 positive cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) Combination With Vigil™ Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label pilot study evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy combination Vigil™ autologous tumor cell immunotherapy Durvalumab ( program cell death ligand 1 ) inhibitor patient PD-L1 negative locally advanced metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) , regardless number prior therapy . PD-L1 negative tumor status define &lt; 1 % membranous PD-L1 stain antihuman PDL1 rabbit monoclonal antibody SP263 ( Ventana , Tucson , AZ ) neoplastic cell . Patients undergo standard surgical procedure ( e.g. , tumor biopsy , palliative resection , thoracentesis malignant pleural effusion ) tumor tissue procure manufacture Vigil™ vaccine . This 2 part study . The first part safety run-in comprise 2 cohort use 3 + 3 design determine Vigil™ dose Part 2 . Cohort 1 receive low dose Vigil™ ( 1x10^6 cells/intradermal ( ID ) injection ) combination Durvalumab ( 1500 mg ( &gt; 30 kg ) IV 60 minute ) every 4 week . Cohort 2 receive Vigil™ 1x10^7 cells/ID injection Durvalumab ( 1500mg ( &gt; 30 kg ) IV 60 minute ) every 4 week . If need , Cohort -1 use receive Vigil™ 1x10^5 cells/ID injection Durvalumab ( 1500mg ( &gt; 30 kg ) IV 60 minute ) every 4 week . The enrollment first two patient Cohort Part 1 stagger 2 week , In Part 2 study , patient meet study eligibility criterion receive Vigil™at dose determine Part 1 Durvalumab ( 1500mg ( &gt; 30 kg ) IV 60 minute ) every 4 week . Three six week tissue procurement occur eligibility reconfirm study site . Subjects must begin study regimen within 6 week tissue procurement . Radiological assessment tumor response perform screening , Cycle 3 every 2nd cycle thereafter , end treatment ( EOT ) use RECIST 1.1 investigator assessment . Tumor biopsy correlative study include score tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) PD-1 PD-L1 expression analysis obtain tissue procurement Cycle 3 . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) correlative study obtain pre-procurement , prior study regimen administration Cycle 1 , Cycle 3 , Cycle 5 EOT . Patient survival follow 1 year treatment initiation .</detailed_description>
