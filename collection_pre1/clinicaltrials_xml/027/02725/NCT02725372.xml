	<criteria>1 . Signed Informed Consent Form ( assent appropriate ) prior initiation study mandate procedure assessment 2 . A confirmed diagnosis PAH Group 1 either idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) , heritable PAH , drug toxininduced PAH , associate PAH ( APAH ) connective tissue disease ( CTD ) , APAH repair simple congenital systemic pulmonary shunt ( i.e. , atrial septal defect , ventricular septal defect and/or patent ductus arteriosus ; complete repair least 1 year prior Screening ) , APAH human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , APAH portal hypertension 3 . Subjects receive least one PAH specific therapy ( ERA PDE5 inhibitor , inhale , subcutaneous , intravenous prostacyclin prostacyclin analog ) type therapy least 3 month stable dose 4 week prior Screening . ( Subjects receive optimal therapy accord disease severity ) 4 . Subjects use oxygen therapy nasal cannula least 4 week prior Screening 5 . PAH diagnosis confirm RHC within previous 5 year , accord follow definition : PVR ≥ 400 dynes.sec.cm5 ( 5 Wood unit ) mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg PCWP LVEDP ≤ 15 mmHg Subjects otherwise meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion undergone RHC within previous 5 year may consider eligible study undergo RHC meet pulmonary hemodynamics criterion 6 . 6MWD ≥ 100 meter ≤ 450 meter prior randomization 7. WHO Functional Class IIIV . Subjects WHO Functional Class IV treat prostacyclin prostacyclin analog ( subcutaneous intravenous ) , plus least one additional PAH specific therapy ( ERA PDE5 ) , available subject reimburse health insurance 8 . Age 18 80 year ( inclusive ) 9 . Willingness use INOpulse delivery device least 16 hour per day 10 . Willingness continue study drug last subject complete Week 18 assessment ( EOS ) 11 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pretreatment pregnancy test ( serum urine ) . All female subject take adequate precaution avoid pregnancy . 1 . Subjects know HIV infection history within past 3 month opportunistic pulmonary disease ( e.g. , tuberculosis , Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , pneumonia ) time Screening 2 . PAH associate untreated thyroid disorder , glycogen storage disease , Gaucher 's disease , hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia , hemoglobinopathy , myeloproliferative disorder splenectomy 3 . Subjects pulmonary condition may contribute PAH include , limited , chronic bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis , pulmonary condition Investigator may deem contribute severity disease impair delivery iNO due airway disease 4 . Subjects receive riociguat 5 . Subjects receive oral prostanoids monotherapy 6 . Any subject unrepaired congenital heart disease repair congenital heart disease simple congenital systemic shunt specify inclusion criterion , i.e. , PAH associate noncorrected simple congenital systemictopulmonary shunt , correct simple congenital systemictopulmonary shunt residual shunt post repair , complex systemictopulmonary shunt , correct noncorrected , complex congenital heart disease , correct noncorrected 7 . PAH associate significant venous capillary involvement , know suspect pulmonary venoocclusive disease , pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis 8 . Any subject WHO PH Groups 2 , 3 , 4 5 9 . Subjects follow cardiac abnormality : 1 . Underlying cardiomyopathy aortic mitral valve disease 2 . Left ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD ) , i.e. , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % leave ventricular shorten fraction ( LVSF ) &lt; 22 % , determine local reading 3 . Current symptomatic coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction within 1 year , coronary artery intervention within 6 month 10 . Systemic hypertension define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 100 mmHg persistent Screening period rest ( treat untreated ) 11 . Subjects history deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism/infarction prothrombotic disorder must chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) exclude ventilation/perfusion lung ( V/Q ) scan 12 . Moderate severe obstructive lung disease define forced expiratory volume 1 second/forced vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) &lt; 70 % FEV1 &lt; 65 % predict value 13 . Moderate severe restrictive lung disease : total lung capacity ( TLC ) &lt; 60 % predict ; TLC 60 % 70 % predict , high resolution CT scan showing diffuse disease mild patchy disease 14 . Any subject develops develop PCWP &gt; 20 mmHg acute vasodilator test ( AVT ) 15 . Systemic hypotension define SBP &lt; 90 mmHg persistent Screening period rest 16 . Moderate severe hepatic impairment , i.e. , ChildPugh Class B C 17 . On dialysis 18 . Acute chronic physical impairment ( dyspnea due PAH ) would limit ability comply study procedure adherence therapy ( i.e. , 6MWT ) , include carry wear pulsed delivery device per study protocol , medical problem ( ) likely preclude completion study 19 . Pregnant breastfeeding female Screening 20 . Administered Larginine within 1 month prior Screening 21 . Known concomitant lifethreatening disease life expectancy le 1 year 22 . Atrial septostomy within 3 month precede randomization 23 . Any subject require use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) , positive pressure device 24 . Use investigational drug device within 1 month prior Screening ( acute vasodilator test iNO ) 25 . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator , make subject unsuitable candidate study 26 . Any subject enrol previous clinical study inhale NO administer pulse delivery . Additional Criteria Continue Treatment Phase Runin Period ( Week 0 Week 2 ) : 1 . Subjects must demonstrate average daily usage INOpulse device ≥ 16 hour ( rounded nearest hour ) 2 day usage &lt; 8 hour per day , initial 2 week study . 2 . If subject experience clinical worsen Screening Runin period , subject eligible enter treatment phase study . 3 . Subjects randomize baseline find meet Inclusion criterion and/or meet Exclusion criterion Runin period withdrawn study . Additional subject enrol meet total target enrollment</criteria>
