	<brief_summary>Intestinal parasite ( IP ) among world 's neglected tropical disease . Morbidity due IPs great school-age child typically high burden infection . In 2001 , WHO pass resolution use large-scale mass drug administration ( MDA ) antihelminthic drug deworm child develop country . Though initially effective , concern MDA might sustainable extended period especially consider large child population high frequency dose . Further , MDAs exert increase drug pressure parasite population , circumstance likely favor parasite genotype resist anthelmintic drug . There hence need alternative affordable sustainable easy implement long term minimal chance development resistance . The investigator propose develop test feasibility corn porridge meal fortify papaya fruit extract show antihelminthic property . The investigator intend evaluate efficacy give school feed program compare outcome albendazole- recommend MDA agent deworming school child . The investigator design formulate product test among child three primary school Western Kenya .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Soil transmit helminthes ( STHs ) among world 's neglected tropical disease . Morbidity due STHs great school-age child typically high burden infection . In 2001 , WHO pass resolution use large-scale mass drug administration ( MDA ) deworm vulnerable child . Though effective , concern MDA might sustainable extended period . Additionally current MDA strategy consider child malnutrition , common malady resource limited country . The investigator report pilot evaluation innovation bundle school feed deworming . The investigator design maize ( corn ) flour fortify ground dry papaya ( Carica papaya ) seed use prepare porridge per usual school meal recipe . Children three primary school Nandi County Kenya randomize three arm : One school receive 300 ml papaya fortify porridge daily ( test school ) , second school receive similar serve plain porridge without pawpaw ingredient ( placebo ) third school receive placebo porridge conventional MDA approach one time 400mg dosage albendazole . Prior randomization , initial baseline stool microscopy analysis do determine presence intensity intestinal worm . Core indicator nutrition-height , weight hemoglobin counts-were also assess . The child monitor daily two month final stool sample analysis clinical monitoring do end study . Baseline follow-up data analyze compare SAS version 9.1 statistical package .</detailed_description>
