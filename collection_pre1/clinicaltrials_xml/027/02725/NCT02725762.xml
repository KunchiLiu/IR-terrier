	<brief_title>Study Photobiomodulation Treat Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LumiThera LT 300® Light Delivery System stationary desktop instrument use emit energy visible near infrared spectrum . The LT-300® designed ophthalmologist use treatment eye photobiomodulation ( PBM ) , process cellular mechanism induce light . PBM utilize many indication , wound healing , soft tissue injury , joint pain , myofascial pain , nerve injury , muscle fatigue temporary improvement blood flow reduction inflammation . The mechanism PBM cellular level ascribe activation mitochondrial respiratory chain component result stabilization metabolic function initiation signal cascade , promote cellular proliferation cytoprotection . The LT-300® provide preset treatment PBM subject 's eye retinal tissue open close eyelid . Approximately 30 subject meeting eligibility requirement study randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive standard care treatment Dry AMD plus PBM treatment LT-300 system , standard care treatment Dry AMD plus Sham treatment LT-300 system . Subjects randomize group receive two 3-week treatment session ( 9 treatment per session ) follow-up visit extend one year . The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy PBM respect visual anatomical outcome subject Dry AMD .</detailed_description>
