	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate whether provide feedback physical activity ( PA ) level patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) feasible enhances daily PA health-related outcome pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) . Patients participate 12-week PR program PA-focused intervention . Patients ' daily PA monitor first ( W1 ) , seventh ( W7 ) 12th ( W12 ) week PR program use activity monitor GT3X+ ( ActiGraph , Pensacola , FL ) feedback give following week . Each participant also receive individualised recommendation improve maintain PA level , base result previous week . It expect , receive individualise feedback goal regard PA level PR program , patient COPD become active improve health-related outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Feedback Physical Activity Health-related Outcomes During Pulmonary Rehabilitation COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) present low level physical activity ( PA ) , associate adverse outcome include increase healthcare utilisation reduce survival . Thus , improve PA level become one main goal COPD research . Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) cornerstone COPD management well-documented effect exercise capacity quality life . However , effect increase patient ' physical activity ( PA ) level limit . Previous research suggest PR PA monitor feedback may suitable approach increase and/or maintain patient ' PA level . Patients COPD participate 12-week PR program plus PA-focused intervention . Daily PA measure use activity monitor GT3X+ ( ActiGraph , Pensacola , FL ) week ( W ) 1 , 7 12 feedback give participant follow week regard : daily step ; time spent sedentary , light moderate-to-vigorous ( MVPA ) intensity activity . The impact intervention explore use mixed-methods approach . Assessments conduct immediately ( W1 ) ( W12 ) PR program . Breathlessness , exercise capacity , functional balance , peripheral muscle strength health-related quality life assess time point . Descriptive statistic use characterise sample . To analyse change outcome measure , data two time point compare . Correlations PA data health-related outcome perform W1 use change score ( i.e. , W12-W1 ) . Patients also invite attend focus group intervention ass perspective use activity monitor feedback give . This pilot study inform main study ( include sample size calculation ) .</detailed_description>
