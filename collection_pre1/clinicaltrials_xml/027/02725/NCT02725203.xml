	<detailed_description>Self-management intervention consider effective chronic disease patient , trial show inconsistent result unknown patient benefit . Adequate self-management require behaviour change patient healthcare provider equip support patient change behaviour . To unravel effectiveness self-management , nurse-led intervention develop target one self-management behaviour , namely physical activity , primary care patient risk cardiovascular disease : Activate intervention . This study aim evaluate effectiveness Activate intervention , identify patient-related characteristic modify change physical activity level patient risk CVD primary care , conduct process evaluation . A two-armed , cluster randomize control trial conduct compare Activate intervention care usual 31 general practice Netherlands , approximately 300 patient risk cardiovascular disease participate . The Activate intervention focus increase physical activity develop use Behavior Change Wheel ( BCW ) . The activate intervention consist four nurse-led consultation divide 3-months period 17 behaviour change technique ( BCTs ) integrate . Primary outcome level physical activity measure accelerometer . Potential effect modifier age , body mass index , level education , social support , depression , patient-provider relationship baseline amount minute physical activity . Data collect baseline , 3 month 6 month follow . Subsequently , BCW apply analyse behavior change need nurse deliver Activate intervention adequately . This result one-day training coaching session supervise health psychologist include 21 BCT . A process evaluation conduct evaluate training nurse , fidelity , dose reach Activate intervention , identify barrier facilitator implementation assess participant ' satisfaction .</detailed_description>
