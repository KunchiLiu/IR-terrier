	<brief_summary>The purpose study illustrate safety effectiveness StimRelieve Halo Nerve Stimulator System treatment chronic migraine . The StimRelieve Halo System utilize minimally invasive procedure implant neurostimulator . This technology include octopolar electrode array stimulator embed receiver . The energy source small , external , rechargeable transmitter , worn patient . The StimRelieve Halo System eliminate implantable pulse generator , common reason reoperation discomfort exist device . For study , subject randomize enrollment either delay immediate continuation group . The immediate continuation group immediately continue stimulation therapy 30-day trial period monitor total 12 month . The delayed activation group device turn 30-day trial period next 3-months . At 3-month visit , group evaluate delayed activation group device reactivate . All subject immediately receive permanent stimulator ( ) . The permanent stimulators easily remove non-responders identify . The wireless technology eliminates need externalized extension , IPG 's thus reoperation . Additionally outcome highly dependent placement stimulators . By eliminate need stag trial , infection rate incidence pocket pain decrease . In study , subject undergo 30-day trial order demonstrate effectiveness . Immediate activation device do post-op period base sensory response subject comfort . Subjects see 14-days post-implant ass patient compliance device , assess clinical response adjust program parameter respond . Subjects see 1 month post-implant headache diary questionnaires review . Subjects respond therapy least 30 % reduction headache day deem non-responders withdrawn study choose device remove . After trial period , responder follow random assignment determine enrollment ( delay immediate continuation ) . All subject monitor total 13 month . Adverse event monitor throughout study .</brief_summary>
