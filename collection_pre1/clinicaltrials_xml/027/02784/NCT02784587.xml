	<brief_summary>Based upon Northern New England Cardiovascular Study Group data , rate post operative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) require treatment follow coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) Maine Medical Center ( MMC ) currently 30 % . Nationally , POAF occur 40 % patient post CABG , 50 % patient valve surgery , 64 % patient post mitral valve CABG 49 % aortic valve replacement . Atrial fibrillation worsen patient 's hemodynamic status increase risk congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , embolic event longer ICU stay lead increase patient morbidity strain financial resource . In U.S. , POAF carry high risk stroke ( 37 % OR 2.0 in-hospital mortality ( OR = 1.7 ) , worsen survival ( 74 % versus 87 % ) , additional 4.9 day $ 10,000- $ 11,500 hospital stay cost . Atrial fibrillation require initiation trigger favorable environment maintenance sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system play important role regard . Unfortunately , precise mechanism POAF still investigate . This postoperative complication persist spite effort mitigate pharmacologically beta blocker amiodarone , experience share cardiac surgery center . The stellate ganglion form fusion inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion first thoracic sympathetic ganglion . By modulate sympathetic component autonomic nervous system , stellate ganglion stimulation show facilitate induction atrial fibrillation ablation may reduce prevent episode . Human study support model . Preliminary study perioperative stellate ganglion block ( SGB ) cardiac surgery suggest technique may reduce prevent episode POAF require treatment . The investigator 's ultimate goal determine whether SGB reduces incidence POAF specific cardiac surgery population MMC . First , however , investigator proposes test hypothesis SGB , perform perioperatively cardiac anesthesiologist population patient undergoing cardiac surgery , safe clinically feasible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Perioperative Stellate Ganglion Blocks Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients MMC undergo transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TA TAVR ) routinely receive paravertebral block analgesia . This added benefit provide unilateral sympathectomy may analogous stellate ganglion block , albeit via different technique . In recent retrospective chart review , TA TAVR block patient show decreased rate new onset POAF . Furthermore , study whether pre-emptive stellate ganglion block increase patency radial artery graft coronary bypass surgery , researcher find statistically significant decrease ( p = 0.048 ) atrial fibrillation use anti-arrhythmic agent . Unfortunately , secondary outcome small patient population , suggestive , study sufficiently power draw definitive conclusion . Importantly , however , report complication related block fifty patient receive intervention . Lastly , additional study demonstrate safety feasibility stellate ganglion mapping ablation CABG also suggest clinically significant effect POAF , use permanent , technically complex time intensive procedure . The investigator 's hypothesis perioperative SGB cardiac surgery clinically efficient efficacious . To address , investigator : 1 . Recruit 49 patient undergo perioperative SGB prior cardiac surgery ( CABG , CABG/Aortic Valve Replacement , Aortic Valve Replacement ) . 2 . Monitor safety SGB use post procedure surface ultrasound neck active solicitation Post-op Day ( POD ) 0 1 identified complication , addition routine clinical monitoring . 3 . Assess clinical feasibility SGB measure procedural efficacy efficiency : 1 . Efficacy measure use post procedure hand temperature ; success indicate increase great 1 degree Celsius . 2 . Efficiency measure time complete block time added standard anesthesia induction sequence , proportion total time operate room . Significance : If investigator able demonstrate perioperative SGB cardiac surgery safe clinically feasible , next step design study investigate effect SGB POAF incidence ( thereby attendant morbidity , mortality cost ) clinical population .</detailed_description>
