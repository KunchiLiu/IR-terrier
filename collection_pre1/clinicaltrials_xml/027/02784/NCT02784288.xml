	<brief_title>Phase II Treatment Stratification Trial Using Neck Dissection-Driven Selection Improve Quality Life Low Risk Patients With HPV+ Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators determine whether treatment stratification neck dissection , accurately pathologically stage patient , minimize number treatment modality patient low risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma , improve quality life . After enrollment , patient undergo neck dissection primary site biopsy . Pathology review patient stratify one three treatment 1 . Patients single lymph node measure less six centimeter , extracapsular extension lymph node , perineural perivascular invasion primary biopsy undergo transoral surgery primary site . 2 . Patients 2 positive node extracapsular extension , perineural perivascular invasion primary biopsy undergo radiation . 3 . Patients extracapsular extension number lymph nodes patient negative margin unable obtain completion transoral surgery undergo chemoradiation . After completion therapy ( surgical , radiation , combine modality ) patient follow closely outpatient basis include regular exam , quality life questionnaire , interval surveillance image clinically indicate . Swallowing function also address videofluoroscopy one year completion therapy . Blood/plasma oral rinse correlative study collect 3-month interval 3 year follow .</detailed_description>
