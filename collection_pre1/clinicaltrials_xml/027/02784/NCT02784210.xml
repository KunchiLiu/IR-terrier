	<brief_summary>Background : Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) affect brain , spinal cord , optic nerve . MS lesion appear MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan many way . Sometimes light outer edge fill inward . This call ring enhancement . Researchers think type lesion may heal well others . Corticosteroids standard treatment reduce symptom MS relapse . But standard treatment people enhance MS lesion without sign MS relapse . Researchers want see short-term high-dose course corticosteroid help heal lesion . Objective : To study effect short-term high-dose corticosteroid ring-enhancing MS . Eligibility : Adults age 35 older : Have MS rim-enhancing lesion prior brain MRI Are enrol another NINDS protocol Design : Participants screen another protocol Participants randomly assign get either treatment 3 day treatment corticosteroid . Participants : 1 baseline visit 3 dose visit 3 day assign get treatment . Participants get methylprednisolone IV day . They get medicine protect stomach . 1 visit month 7 month Visits include medical history physical exam . Participants blood urine test . Participants also neurological exam MRIs . Participants lie table slide cylinder . They scanner 1.5 2 hour . They get dye catheter : A needle guide thin plastic tube arm vein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives . The primary aim pilot study assess effect short-term , high-dose corticosteroid administration 12-week evolution multiple sclerosis lesion centripetal enhancement pattern magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , particular respect development hypointense rim 7-tesla phase image . In prior work , phase rim associate persistent deleterious inflammation poor repair ongoing neurodegeneration within lesion . Study population . Up 30 multiple sclerosis patient asymptomatic contrast-enhancing lesion enrol . Patients randomly assign either 3 day intravenous methylprednisolone ( 1000 mg/day ) treatment . Design . Patients undergo serial brain MRIs gadolinium-based contrast agent 3- 7- tesla scanner approximate 25-week period . 3-tesla scan obtain baseline every 4 week week 25 . 7-tesla scan obtain baseline week 1 , 13 , 25 . Participants one centripetal/rim-enhancing lesion baseline scan randomize followed . Clinical evaluation blood test perform baseline week 1 , 13 , 25 . Outcome measure . The primary outcome measure presence absence , week-13 7-tesla scan , hypointense phase rim lesion follow time . Secondary outcome measure include persistence gadolinium enhancement week 1 , presence absence hypointense phase rim week 25 , lesion volume , intralesional median R1 relaxation rate , week 13 25 . From 3-tesla scan , measure time evolution normalize intralesional proton density-weighted , T2-weighted , T1-weighted signal , well R1 relaxation rate magnetization transfer ratio . We also assess presence absence hypointense phase 3T . Additional exploratory outcome measure , include clinical immunological assessment , also collect .</detailed_description>
