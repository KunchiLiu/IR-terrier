	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm malignant pleural mesothelioma . Patients must eligible receive standard chemotherapy pemetrexed cisplatin contraindication standard chemotherapy . Patients must unresectable advanced and/or metastatic disease , incurable standard therapy . All patient must tumour block primary metastatic tumour available consent release block/recently cut slide correlative analysis ( See Section 11.0 ) centre/pathologist must agree submission specimen ( ) . Presence radiologically document disease . At least one site disease must unidimensionally measurable follow : CT scan ( slice thickness ≤ 5 mm ) : ≥ 10 mm &gt; long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) : ≥ 10 mm Lymph nod CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; measure short axis All radiology study must perform within 21 day prior registration ( exception : within 28 day negative ) . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Previous Therapy Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : Patients must receive prior chemotherapy stage advanced/metastatic disease . Patients receive previous ( neo ) adjuvant cisplatinbased systemic chemotherapy must receive last dose chemotherapy least 12 month registration . Other AntiCancer Therapy : Patients may receive target small molecule therapy , immunotherapies viral therapy , biologic therapy angiogenesis inhibitor advanced/metastatic disease , prior immunotherapy stage disease . Radiation : Patients may prior radiation therapy . A minimum 28 day must elapse end radiotherapy registration onto study . Radiation must involve &lt; 30 % function bone marrow must measurable disease outside previously irradiate area ( patient whose sole site disease previously irradiate area ineligible UNLESS evidence progression , new lesion document , irradiated field ) . ( Exceptions may make however , low dose , palliative radiotherapy please call CCTG 6135336430 PRIOR registration question arise interpretation criterion ) . Patients must recover acute toxic effect radiation prior registration . Previous Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 28 day prior patient registration wound heal occur . Lab Requirements : Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Patients must accessible treatment , response assessment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient randomization . Women/men childbearing potential must agree use two highly effective contraceptive method study six month discontinuation . Patient must able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete quality life questionnaire . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy ( dose 10 mg prednisone equivalent ) form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 3 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g . thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Must receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Patients know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Patients experience untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) . Patients significant cardiac history , even control , LVEF ≥ 50 % . Patients history malignancy require concurrent anticancer therapy . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pembrolizumab chemotherapy agent . Patients receive concurrent treatment anticancer therapy investigational anticancer agent . Patients serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol include , limited : History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement . Active infection require systemic therapy ; ( include patient know active hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) [ note : testing asymptomatic patient require ] tuberculosis ) .
