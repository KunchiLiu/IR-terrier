	<brief_title>Comparison KRAS/BRAF Mutational Status With Conventional Techniques Plasma Samples Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analyzing qualitatively quantitatively genetic alteration efficient , simple cost-effective test blood sample could optimize therapeutic decision-making personalized cancer care . Cell-free DNA ( ccfDNA ) level plasma CRC patient significantly high healthy patient . These level decrease progressively tumor-free patient follow-up period increase patient recurrence metastasis . In near future , detection circulate DNA ( ccfDNA ) could therefore represent technology breakthrough diagnosis , prognosis , detection tumor growth cancer patient follow . We design refine innovative method simultaneously allow determination three parameter : specific quantification tumor-derived ccfDNA , ccfDNA fragmentation index , SNP ( Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ) point mutation detection . In addition unprecedented sensitivity specificity , qPCR based-method ( termed IntPlex® ) , recently patent CNRS , easy rapid , first multiplexed test ccfDNA . Evaluation validation IntPlex® test examine response press need determine KRAS/BRAF mutational status anti-EGFR therapy CRC patient . As consequence , method adapt detect six frequent KRAS mutation CRC ( G12D , G12V , G13D , G12S , G12C , G12A ) BRAF V600E . We carry first blind prospective study compare KRAS BRAF mutational status data obtain analysis tumor tissue routine gold standard method plasma DNA use original method ( ASCO oral communication ) . The mutational status determine method 70 patient sample . Our result clearly show first time ccfDNA analysis KRAS mutation could replace advantageously tumor-section analysis . CcfDNA analysis show 100 % specificity sensitivity BRAF V600E mutation . For six tested KRAS point mutation , method exhibit 100 % specificity 87 % sensitivity concordance value 96 % . The goal multicenter prospective study validate , ultimately translate routine clinical practice , use plasma analysis ccfDNA determination KRAS mutation status mCRC patient .</detailed_description>
