	<brief_summary>Design : Single center , double-blind , sham-controlled trial randomize symptomatic patient coronary chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) CTO percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) sham procedure . All patient receive optimal medical therapy . Treatment : CTO PCI , per standard clinical practice . Control : Patients randomize sham-procedure undergo bilateral arterial access , without angiography PCI perform . Secondary Endpoints : ( 1 ) Greater improvement SAQ-7 Summary score entire duration follow-up ( 6 month ) use repeat measure analysis ( 2 ) Greater improvement individual component patient ' health status ( 3 ) Greater improvement exercise capacity ( 4 ) Similar incidence major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) , peri-procedural long-term</brief_summary>
