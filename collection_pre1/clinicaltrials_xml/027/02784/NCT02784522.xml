	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Proximal Humerus Fractures With Internal Fixation Improves Shoulder Function Older Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment proximal humerus fracture emphasize restoration shoulder function . Older patient , loss bodily function , face enormous difficulty fracture heal shoulder functional recovery sustain proximal humerus fracture . As previously report , open reduction conventional lock plate fixation achieve fair outcomes 48 case proximal humerus fracture old patient , excellent rate 85.4 % accord Neer classification system . The investigator ' clinical experience , however , show stability internal fixation inadequate must enhance . Consequently , investigator design microsurgical implantation use lock compression plate ( LCP ) treat proximal humerus fracture old patient . In search Web Science database , investigator find randomize control trial report Wang et al . LCP fixation use microsurgical technique well outcomes 20 case proximal humerus fracture old patient . However , limitation create small sample size profound effect reliability study . No relevant article retrieve Chinese Clinical Trial Register , one similar article find ClinicalTrials.gov : `` Proximal Humerus Fractures : Randomized Study Between Locking Nails Locking Plates Neer 2 3 Parts '' ( identifier : NCT01984112 ) . In clinical trial , Constant-Murley score consider primary outcome , follow-up period 12 month . Importantly , inclusion criterion study arm distinctly different investigator ' study protocol . The main principle minimally invasive technique orthopedics implant specific bony plate , fix across transverse fracture , via small incision periosteum , skin , muscle . These implantation device include less invasive stabilization system , dynamic compression plate system , LCP system . Internal fixation LCP system involve two completely different fixation technique two oppose osteosynthesis principle , namely conventional plate bridging plate osteosyntheses characterize direct anatomical reduction . Because special design , LCP use dynamic compression plate , pure internal fixator use lock head screw , combine , thus provide variety therapeutic option surgeon . Moreover , LCP good stability induces le damage periosteum ; therefore beneficial bone heal functional recovery . Given characteristic , LCP likely strong stability conventional lock plate internal fixation fracture . Therefore , investigator design study protocol compare LCP conventional lock plate use minimally invasive technique internal fixation proximal humerus fracture old patient . The investigator hypothesize LCP effective conventional lock plate promote shoulder function recovery high excellent rate accord Neer classification system proximal humerus fracture . Data collection , management , analysis , open access - Data collection : All data , include demographic information , disease diagnosis , concomitant disease , allergic history ( drug allergy ) , adverse reaction , collect case report form summarize one form . These data record electronically use double-data entry strategy EpiData software . - Data management : Only project manager right query database , change allow . All data relevant clinical trial preserve Affiliated Hospital Qinghai University . - Data analysis : All data statistically analyze professional statistician . The statistical report statistician give project manager responsible write research report . An independent data monitoring committee charge data monitoring management throughout entire trial ensure scientific accuracy , authenticity , integrity . - Open data : Published data release www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis The statistical analysis complete statistician use SPSS 19.0 statistical software ( IBM Corp. , Armonk , NY , USA ) line intention-to-treat principle . Intergroup comparison excellent rate accord Neer classification system perform use chi-square test . The operation time , intraoperative blood loss , postoperative hospital stay , fracture healing time , visual analogue scale score , SF-36 score compare use Mann-Whitney U test . A value P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Adverse event - Predicted unanticipated adverse event record trial . - Adverse event include dizziness , fever , infection , subacromial impingement , humeral head necrosis , malunion , severe pain detect . - All serious adverse event record detail , include date occurrence , type event , treatment , report project manager institution review board within 24 hour .</detailed_description>
