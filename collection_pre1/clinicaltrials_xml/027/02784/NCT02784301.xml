	<brief_summary>Belly breathe popular relaxation technique use reduce anxiety pain child medical procedure . The investigator develop biofeedback game help teach child belly breathe interactive way . Existing study show biofeedback tool effective way teach relaxation technique child . The purpose study evaluate 1 ) whether new biofeedback tool effective engaging way teach belly breathe child 2 ) whether application effective reduce procedural pain anxiety compare standard care , self-directed belly breathe alone self-directed belly-breathing combine visual distraction . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . The smartphone-based biofeedback game belly breathe reduce self-reported procedural anxiety pain child blood collection procedure compare : 1. standard care 2. belly breathe + standard care procedures 3. belly breathe visual component application coach biofeedback distraction . 2 . The smartphone-based biofeedback game increase compliance belly breathe compare self-directed breathing . 3 . Belly breathe smartphone-based biofeedback game engage compare self-directed belly breathe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose The purpose present study evaluate clinical efficacy belly breathe use smartphone-based biofeedback application reduce procedural anxiety pain child blood draw blood collection lab BC Children 's Hospital . This phase study focus evaluate 1 ) efficacy application child age 5-17 reduce self -- report pain anxiety blood collection 2 ) ability application increase belly breathe compliance engagement compare traditional teaching method . 2 . Objectives The propose project aim answer follow question : 1 . Will smartphone-based biofeedback game belly breathe reduce self-reported procedural anxiety pain child blood collection procedure compare ) standard care b ) belly breathe + standard care procedure c ) belly breathe visual component application coach biofeedback distraction ? 2 . Will smartphone-based biofeedback game increase compliance belly breathe compare self-directed belly breathe ? 3 . Will belly breathe smartphone-based biofeedback game engage compare self-directed belly breathe ? 3 . Justification Belly breathing , type deep diaphragmatic breathing typically produce relaxed state , popular behavioural intervention use reduce anxiety child undergo medical procedure . Studies show decreased anxiety associate decreased distress also decrease pain less negative attitude towards future medical procedure . Biofeedback tool use teach child connection mind body . Very little research currently exist use biofeedback application teach relaxation child clinical setting ; however , evidence suggests could effective . This study examine efficacy use tool teach belly breathe child order reduce procedural anxiety pain . 4 . Research Methods To explore hypothesis , study design employ randomize control trial design . Expected experienced self-report anxiety pain score child assign belly breathe biofeedback group compare control group score . The experimental group teach belly breathe use biofeedback game application instruct use blood collection procedure . Control Group 1 receive standard care . Control Group 2 receive belly breathe train without application instruct continue self-directed belly breathing procedure . Control Group 3 teach belly breathe without application plus receive distraction watch cartoon avatar hot air balloon rise space ; however , avatar 'coach ' child visual cue breathe ( word bubble ) present avatar rise response correct belly breathe . Belly breathe compliance measure use extracted respiratory rate collect PPG data . Two trained volunteer recruit participant wait room main blood collection BC Children 's Hospital . They approach parent child invite participate study . If parent child interested , give consent assent form read return volunteer time procedure decide participate . 5 . Data Analysis Pain Scores : An analysis covariance use determine whether experimental subject report significantly less pain blood collection control patient . To determine whether belly breathe application alter expectation pain , sample divide high low expectation pain use median split pain score . A 2x3 repeated measure analysis variance carry compare high low expectation group Time 1 , 2 , 3 . Paired t-tests carry high low expectation group within experimental control condition determine whether change expect pain Time 1 Time 2 . In order clinically significant difference 2 10 pain score detect ( alpha=0.05 , power 80 % ) 70 child need per group . In order allow non-compliance post-study exclusion child cardiovascular/respiratory condition use topical anaesthetic , investigator need recruit approximately 300 child . Anxiety score : Changes time four group analyze time x group interaction repeat analysis variance . Paired T-Tests carry four group determine whether change anxiety Time 1 Time 2 . A Pearson correlation use investigate relationship anxiety score pain score four group . Belly Breathing Compliance : Photoplethysmograph ( PPG ) data collect blood collection experimental group Control Groups 2 3 analyze use standard peak detection method . Independent Sample T-tests carry amplitude RSA . Level significance set p=0.05 . Engagement Scores : The response question Study Completion Questionnaires Experimental Group Control Groups 2 3 analyze separately use Independent Sample T-Test . Level significance set p=0.05 . The Bonferroni Correction use adjust multiple measure .</detailed_description>
