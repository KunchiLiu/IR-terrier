Patients must meet criterion high risk AMM define : Bone marrow plasma cell ≥ 10 % and/or level monoclonal protein ( Mprotein ) &gt; 3 g/dL Abnormal FLC ratio absence end organ damage ( CRAB ) define : lytic bone lesion skeletal survey , calcium ≥ 11mg/dl , hemoglobin value &gt; 2 g/100 ml low limit normal hemoglobin value &lt; 10 g/100 ml renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine &gt; 0.173 mmol/l ) Note : Patients BMPC &gt; 60 % , serum free light chain ratio &gt; 100 , know 2 great focal lesion MRI clinically felt require therapy include . Measurable disease define : Mspike &gt; 1 g/dL , Bence Jones protein &gt; 200 mg/24 hour urine protein electrophoresis involve serum free light chain ( FLC ) &gt; 10 mg /dl Adequate hematologic end organ function , define follow laboratory result obtain within 28 day prior first study treatment ( Cycle 1 , Day 1 ) : ANC ≥ 1500 cells/ µL WBC count &gt; 2500/ µL Lymphocyte count ≥ 300/ µL Platelet count ≥ 75,000/ µL Total bilirubin within normal range AST ALT within normal range Serum creatinine within normal range creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min basis CockcroftGault glomerular filtration rate estimation : ( 140 age ) x ( weight kg ) x ( 0.85 female ) / 72 x ( serum creatinine mg/dL ) For woman childbearing potential : agreement remain abstinent ( refrain heterosexual intercourse ) use contraceptive method result failure rate &lt; 1 % per year treatment period least 90 day last dose study drug . A woman consider childbearing potential postmenarcheal , reach postmenopausal state ( ≥ 12 continuous month amenorrhea identify cause menopause ) , undergone surgical sterilization ( removal ovary and/or uterus ) . Examples contraceptive method failure rate &lt; 1 % per year include bilateral tubal ligation , male sterilization , establish , proper use hormonal contraceptive inhibit ovulation , hormonereleasing intrauterine device , copper intrauterine device . The reliability sexual abstinence evaluate relation duration clinical trial prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . For men : agreement remain abstinent ( refrain heterosexual intercourse ) use contraceptive measure agreement refrain donate sperm , define : With female partner childbearing potential pregnant female partner , men must remain abstinent use condom treatment period least 90 day last dose study drug . Men must refrain donating sperm period . The reliability sexual abstinence evaluate relation duration clinical trial prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients meet follow criterion exclude study entry . General Any approve anticancer therapy , include chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy , within 3 week prior initiation study treatment ; however , follow allow : Herbal therapy &gt; 1 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 ( herbal therapy intend anticancer therapy must discontinue least 1 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 ) AEs prior anticancer therapy resolve Grade ≤ 1 except alopecia Known liver disease , include active viral , alcoholic , hepatitis ; cirrhosis ; fatty liver ; inherit liver disease Known hypersensitivity Chinese hamster ovary cell product recombinant human antibody Inability comply study followup procedure History active autoimmune disease , include limited systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , type 1 diabetes mellitus , inflammatory bowel disease , vascular thrombosis associate antiphospholipid syndrome , Wegener 's granulomatosis , Sjögren 's syndrome , Bell 's palsy , GuillainBarré syndrome , multiple sclerosis , autoimmune thyroid disease , vasculitis , glomerulonephritis autoimmune relate dermatologic disease History idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , pneumonitis ( include drug induce ) , organize pneumonia ( i.e. , bronchiolitis obliterans , cryptogenic organize pneumonia , etc. ) . Any disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug may affect interpretation result render patient high risk treatment complication History HIV infection know active hepatitis B ( chronic acute ) hepatitis C infection Patients past resolve hepatitis B infection ( define negative hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg ] test positive antiHBc [ antibody hepatitis B core antigen ] antibody test ) eligible . Patients positive hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody eligible polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) negative HCV RNA . Active tuberculosis require therapy . Severe infection within 4 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 , include limited hospitalization complication infection , bacteremia , severe pneumonia Major surgical procedure within 28 day prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 anticipation need major surgical procedure course study Administration live , attenuated vaccine within 4 week Cycle 1 , Day 1 anticipation live , attenuated vaccine require study Influenza vaccination give influenza season . Patients must receive live , attenuate influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist™ ) within 4 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 time study . Malignancies myeloma within 5 year prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 , exception negligible risk metastasis death expect curative outcome ( adequately treat carcinoma situ cervix , basal squamous cell skin cancer , localize prostate cancer treat surgically curative intent , ductal carcinoma situ treat surgically curative intent ) undergo active surveillance per standardofcare management ( e.g. , chronic lymphocytic leukemia Rai Stage 0 , prostate cancer Gleason score ≤ 6 , prostatespecific antigen [ PSA ] ≤ 10 mg/mL , etc. ) . MedicationRelated Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 therapeutic antibody pathway target agent . Treatment another investigational agent within 4 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 ( within five half live investigational product , whichever long ) Treatment systemic immunosuppressive medication ( include limit prednisone , cyclophosphamide , azathioprine , methotrexate , thalidomide , antitumor necrosis factor [ antiTNF ] agent ) within 2 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 . Patients receive acute , low dose , systemic immunosuppressant medication ( e.g. , onetime dose dexamethasone nausea ) may enrol . The use inhale corticosteroid mineralocorticoid ( e.g. , fludrocortisone ) patient orthostatic hypotension adrenocortical insufficiency allow .
