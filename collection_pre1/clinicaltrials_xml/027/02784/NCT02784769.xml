	<brief_summary>During biological life , proteins undergo molecular age due many non-enzymatic post-translational modification alter structural functional property . These reaction concern proteins especially tissue protein ( whose half-life organism several decade ) lead formation complex product call PTMDPs ( `` post-translational modification derive product '' ) . Molecular age responsible alteration protein property may cause change mechanical property tissue age pathology . However , involvement process vivo remain unclear , particularly aneurysmal pathology . So , aim study determine whether molecular age matrix protein within vessel wall may participate development aortic aneurysm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize molecular age matrix protein may participate formation aortic aneurysm . Indeed , well know aneurysm wall subject important structural change include variation extracellular matrix composition . However , study look link molecular age matrix protein formation aneurysm . So , aim study understand role protein molecular age context . For purpose , several approach use reach aim : ( 1 ) To evaluate degree modification matrix component aneurysmal wall biological histological study ( concentration PTMDPs ( homocitrulline , carboxymethyllysine , pentosidine MG-H1 ) expression RAGE ) ; ( 2 ) To determine link tissue concentration PTMDPs severity aneurysmal pathology ; ( 3 ) To compare concentration PTMDPs obtain aneurysmal wall obtain skin serum ; ( 4 ) To establish link concentration PTMDPs ( serum , skin vascular wall ) , fragmentation elastin different haematological parameter potentially involve development pathology aneurysmal . Design study : single-center cross-sectional study . Population : 40 patient aneurysm infra-renal abdominal aorta require surgical treatment open surgery . Patients divide 2 group base size aneurysm ( Group 1 : 20 patient aneurysm diameter 75 mm ; Group 2 : 20 patient aneurysm diameter 75 mm ; patient rupture aneurysm include group ) . Investigation scheme : obtain inform consent patient , several sample investigation do : blood ( PTMDPs hematological paramaters ) , measurement skin autofluorescence ( AGE-Reader ) , skin biopsy collection ( 2 3 mm wide centimeter laparotomy ) , biopsy aneurysmal aneurysmal aortic wall ( abdominal aorta fragment usually resect part surgery therefore surgical waste ) collection intra-aneurysmal peri-thrombotic liquid ( available ) . Statistical analysis : ( 1 ) Description data use mean standard deviation quantitative variable percentage qualitative variable . ( 2 ) Comparison PTMDP concentration patient group tissue location ( healthy aortic aneurysm ) use Mann-Whitney test . ( 3 ) Search link concentration tissue PTMDPs , serum , skin autofluorescence , hematologic marker use Spearman correlation test .</detailed_description>
