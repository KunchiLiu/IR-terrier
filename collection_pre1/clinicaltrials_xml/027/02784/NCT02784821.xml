	<brief_summary>Prolonged antibiotic use preterm neonates significant consequence develop intestinal microbiome , metabolome host response , predispose neonate various major morbidity , include necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , late-onset sepsis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , mortality . The hypothesis early prolong antibiotic use preterm neonates significant consequence develop intestinal microbiome , metabolome host response , predispose neonate various major morbidity . It possible effect widespread antibiotic use outweigh potential benefit . This study randomize preterm infant bear less 33 week gestation either pre-emptive antibiotic no-pre-emptive antibiotic . The purpose research evaluate risk benefit current practice determine optimal level antibiotic use protect baby infection minimal effect microbiome subsequent adverse outcome relate overuse antibiotic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotic `` Dysbiosis '' Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A majority preterm low birthweight ( VLBW ) infant expose antibiotic . Surveys large database US show rate culture prove bacteremia infant birth 1-2 percent . Antibiotic use , especially repeat , induces perturbation ( `` dysbiosis '' ) gut microbiota may recover basal state . Antibiotic use increase risk subsequent disease adverse outcomes . The dependence develop immune system intestinal microbiota support emerge evidence study animal demonstrate decreased resistance subsequent disease early exposure antibiotic . A retrospective review 50,0261 neonate across 127 neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) California show forty-fold variation NICU antibiotic prescribing practice similar burden proven infection mortality . A large number preterm infant thus subject potentially harmful course antibiotic provide clear benefit . There remain major gap understand antibiotic-related intestinal microbial dysbiosis may result disease . There two aim . In first aim , prospective , randomize pilot study , test effect pre-emptive postnatal antibiotic microbiome , metabolome inflammatory response neonate NICU course . The second aim assess effect pre-emptive postnatal antibiotic adverse outcome neonate NICU . The hypothesis higher antibiotic use associate decrease early onset sepsis fact , associate increase adverse outcomes include necrotizing enterocolitis , late onset sepsis , BPD , mortality .</detailed_description>
