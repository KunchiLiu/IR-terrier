	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Closed Reduction Internal Fixation With Screws Distal Radius Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal radius fracture define fracture within 3 cm distal articular surface . When radius fracture ulnar styloid process fracture occur together , internal fixation generally pursue ; however , adverse event may occur reduction external fixation , include unstable fracture fragment , malalignment , loss radial inclination ulnar deviation , lead wrist function impairment . The commonly use treatment method distal radius fracture include internal fixation steel plate , internal fixation Kirschner wire , external fixation . Open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) disadvantage . For example , pronator teres incise palmar ORIF situ suture muscle possible patient implantation titanium plate . Even suture possible , strength pronator teres decrease surgery , second surgery need remove titanium plate . Dorsal ORIF also disadvantageous tendon thin soft tissue may encounter surgery . In addition , tendon sheath injury inevitable , leading myotenositis , tendon adhesion , even tendon rupture . Thus , internal fixators take early possible . Satisfactory wrist function outcome achieve external fixators , particular dynamic external fixators . However , although external fixation good fixing effect , provide poor lateral stability , result injury superficial branch radial nerve , screw channel infection , screw channel fracture , screw loosening , even Sudeck 's atrophy . Internal fixation Kirschner wire generate minimal surgical trauma , technique provide sufficient strength fixation therefore rarely used present . There urgent need develop stable fixation method distal radius fracture . Minimally invasive surgery avoids tissue damage impairment physiological function cause open surgery precise location technique . Brachial plexus anesthesia allow surgeon avoid large incision excessive bleeding . There palmar dorsal incision minimally invasive surgery distal radius fracture , structure surround wrist joint iatrogenically damage , theoretically improve wrist function recovery . During C-arm fluoroscopy-assisted minimally invasive close reduction , either surgical incision incision 0.5 cm length make wrist joint ; fracture fragment reduce fully thread headless cannulate compression screw . Repair stability assess C-arm fluoroscopic X-ray system . This method theoretically feasible distal radius fracture . The fracture fragment fix fully thread , cannulate , variable-pitch , headless compression screw , increase fragment stability . Therefore , investigator hypothesize C-arm fluoroscopy-assisted minimally invasive close reduction fix distal radius fracture allow patient perform wrist function exercise early possible . Our previous study confirm minimally invasive close reduction internal fixation fully thread headless cannulate compression screw precise therapeutic effect distal radius fracture . This method improve wrist function , therapeutic effect similar conventional open reduction internal fixation titanium plate . The result previous study show Table 1 . However , clear whether minimally invasive close reduction internal fixation fully thread headless cannulate compression screw advantage conventional open reduction internal fixation titanium plat distal radius fracture repair . In study , investigator hypothesize minimally invasive close reduction internal fixation fully thread headless cannulate compression screw provide good stability conventional method , effectively promote early recovery wrist function . Under condition cut fracture fragment , blood supply compromise fracture fragment , destruction local microenvironment , C-arm fluoroscopy assistance , investigator perform minimally invasive close reduction , pressurize fracture fragment fully thread headless cannulate compression screw , investigate whether method distal radius fracture repair provide satisfactory stability allow early wrist function recovery . Safety assessment Adverse event accurately record , include time onset , severity , duration , measure take . The know possible adverse event include bone nonunion , displaced fracture , wrist joint pain , Sudeck 's syndrome , primary secondary tendon injury , shoulder-hand syndrome , traumatic arthritis wrist joint , implant failure , malunion , infection , septicemia , thrombosis . Any following consider severe adverse event : death , prolong hospital stay , mutilation , fatal reaction , teratogenicity . Any adverse event occur trial report researcher charge ethic committee within 24 hour . Data management Data trial keep secure , lock storage area limit access later review biostatistician , researcher charge . Statistical analysis All data statistically process SPSS 11.0 software ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Normally distributed measurement data express mean SD . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) , median , upper quartile ( q3 ) . The numeration data express constituent ratio . The Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test use compare age course disease experimental control group . The chi-square test use compare sex difference two group . The Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test also use compare image parameter ( example , angle , height , length ) , PRWE score , heal time fracture , VAS score . The chi-square test also use compare effective rate two group . An alpha level 0.05 ( two-sided ) consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
