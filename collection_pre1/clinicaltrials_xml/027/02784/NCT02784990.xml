	<brief_summary>Surgery principal treatment benign malignant pancreatic tumour . This surgery accompany complication among main one pancreatic fistula , lead flow pancreatic juice abdominal cavity . Depending severity , fistula manage medically , implantation la pose d'un percutaneous drain , endoscopic treatment , revisit surgery . It show early management fistula prevents evolve towards major complication haemorrhage serious intra-abdominal infection . To date , early diagnosis pancreatic fistula base high level one pancreatic enzyme , amylase , drain . However certain clinical situation , patient present post-operative fistula elevation amylase . And , contrary , increased amylase clinical consequence . It therefore necessary identify another early early marker pancreatic fistula correspond well clinical sign . In preliminary study conduct 65 patient , investigator recently find another pancreatic enzyme ( lipase ) could pertinent marker pancreatic fistula , require confirmation great number patient . The objective evaluate diagnostic performance lipase drain early detection pancreatic fistula clinical repercussion 30 day follow surgery . The study consist collect 4 different time point ( D1 , D3 , D4 D6 ) tube blood tube drain liquid .</brief_summary>
