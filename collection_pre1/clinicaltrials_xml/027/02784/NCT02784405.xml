	<brief_summary>Self-apposing , drug-eluting Stentys coronary stent represent valuable tool treatment coronary artery stenosis . Their ability adapt widely vary vessel caliber auto-expand release self-appose vessel wall particularly useful presence ectasic coronary artery significant vessel tapering . The investigator plan study ass feasibility , effectiveness safety implantation self-apposing , drug-eluting Stentys stent percutaneous coronary intervention . Consecutive patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention implantation self-apposing Stentys stent enrol multi center registry . Inclusion criterion age ≥ 18 year ability provide inform consent . No exclusion criterion define . Primary end-point study occurrence MACE ( death , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis , unplanned hospitalization unstable angina , target lesion revascularization ) . Secondary end-points include individual component MACE , procedural complication ( periprocedural MI , bleeding , access site complication , failure cross stent strut guidewire treatment bifurcation , failure delivery stent , contrast-induced nephropathy ) , bleeding follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Choice appropriate size stent treatment coronary artery stenosis often challenge . Marked taper vessel ' diameter proximal-distal development may lead sub-optimal result . Distal under-expansion drug-eluting stent ( DES ) vessel perforation may occur large DES , best suit proximal diameter , choose . Proximal DES under-sizing strut malapposition may happen small DES , fit distal diameter , implant . Moreover , ectasic vessel present irregular varying diameter , may lead well segmental malapposition under-expansion DES . Self-apposing stent overcome limitation thanks ability self-expand also release vessel adapt wide range vessel diameter . Multiple generation self-apposing , drug-eluting stent develop , progressive amendment pertain stent-deployment technique ( deployment covering-sheath retraction balloon-delivery ) drug release ( paclitaxel sirolimus ) . The last generation self-apposing stent represent sirolimus-eluting , balloon-delivered Xposition S stent . Studies assess performance stent however limited sample size length follow , mainly control trial . Few data available regard clinical outcome self-apposing Stentys stent `` real-life '' setting . Aim study ass feasibility , effectiveness safety implantation self-apposing , drug-eluting Stentys stent percutaneous coronary intervention . Study population : Patients undergo percutaneous coronary intervention implantation self-apposing Stentys stent . Primary analysis : Longitudinal cohort follow Study end-points : Primary efficacy end-point : - Major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) ( composite end point include death , myocardial infarction ( MI , exclude periprocedural MI ) , stent thrombosis , unplanned hospitalization unstable angina , target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) ) Secondary efficacy end-points : - Individual component MACE ( death , MI , stent thrombosis , unplanned hospitalization , TLR ) Secondary safety end-points : - Procedural complication : - Periprocedural MI - Bleedings - Access site complication - Failure cross stent strut guidewire treatment bifurcation - Failure delivery stent - Contrast-induced nephropathy - Bleedings follow</detailed_description>
