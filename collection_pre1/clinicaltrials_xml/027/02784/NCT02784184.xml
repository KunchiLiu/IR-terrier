	<detailed_description>Minipuberty term use describe transient activation pituitary-gonadal axis 2-3 month birth boys girl . It , however , know infant reach adult level reproductive hormone early life , exact timing peak know . Furthermore , determines time peaks suppression reproductive hormone infancy throughout childhood adolescence remain elucidate . Few study investigate minipuberty one , example , find affected premature infant ( gestation week 37 ) . However , study normative data throughout minipuberty infant exist . Furthermore , use minipuberty window diagnosis endocrine disorder future reproductive function suggest . Defining minipuberty , term circulate hormone level urinary metabolite , healthy infant therefore essential order utilize window . Studies use patient Disorders Sex Development minipuberty carry , hamper small sample size lack control group . In addition , little know genetic epigenetic factor drive onset , progression termination minipuberty well actual puberty , i.e . factor responsible quiescence HPG axis childhood dis-inhibition responsible pubertal onset . Therefore , much attention drawn study perform whole exome sequencing patient relatives central precocious puberty ( CPP ) . For first time , MKRN3 suggest primary factor responsible HPG inhibition mid-childhood . A number study support MKRN3 mutation cause CPP , genetic variation MKRN3 affect pubertal timing healthy girl . Our finding decline serum level MKRN3 prior pubertal onset healthy girl support MKRN3 regulator pubertal onset . The exact mechanism MRKN3 exceed effect remain elucidate ; however , zink-finger structure indicate regulation superior cellular process epigenetic regulation DNA transcription . Twin study suggest 60 % inter-individual variation cause genetic factor . However , genome wide association ( GWA ) study explain fraction variation age puberty . Recently , research group reveal large effect single SNP age pubertal onset girl . The location SNPs gene regulate FSH action emphasize need wide focus include downstream process HPG axis evaluate factor regulate puberty . In general , abovementioned study lead spark interest epigenetic study , i.e . study genetic change cause change DNA sequence , rather regulatory mechanism DNA expression . Generally , think include DNA methylation , histone modification small RNAs . Epi-mutations ( improper epigenetic regulation ) possibly account variation puberty genetic factor . Previously , gene-specific genome-wide DNA methylation pattern study . Genome-wide hypomethylation see peripheral leukocyte show linked array cancer , include colorectal cancer . As multiple histone modification exist analysis require special sample treatment procedure , DNA methylation appropriate epigenetic marker analyze . A study rat find specific gene hypomethylation accountable lack pubertal onset , link epigenetics mini- pubertal timing progression , however , scarcely study . Understanding link would greatly add knowledge reproductive function normal sex development . Disorders Sex Development ( DSD ) umbrella term cover condition congenital disorder development chromosomal , gonadal anatomical sex . Genital abnormality may include many 4-6 1000 birth , although individual disorder much rarer , e.g . 45 , X/46 , XY mosaicism see 1 15000 live birth . Previously DSD diagnose label different often imprecise term 'intersex ' , 'sex reversal ' 'hermaphroditism ' etc . In 2006 , DSD nomenclature rename grouped accord genetic sex sex chromosome DSD , 46 , XY DSD 46 , XX DSD . DSD patient diagnose different period life depend diagnosis , phenotype primary secondary sexual development . Patients sex chromosome DSD diagnose prenatal screening , patient affect external genitalia birth , childhood due growth abnormality , adolescence due abnormal pubertal progression lastly , adulthood due infertility . Understanding normal sex development therefore key identify optimize diagnosis treatment patient DSD . A project , present , seeks investigate normal minipuberty compare minipuberty patient DSD therefore great importance . Furthermore , knowledge genetic epigenetic control mechanism minipuberty aid understand reproductive physiology particular DSD pathology .</detailed_description>
