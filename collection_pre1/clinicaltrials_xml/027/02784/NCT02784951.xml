	<detailed_description>This study evaluate prehospital transfusion therapy exsanguinating patient treat physician-staffed emergency medical service Norway , follow main question : I . Are out-of-hospital transfusion associate increase adverse transfusion event compare inhospital transfusion ? II . Is out-of-hospital physician administration plasma blood product exsanguinating patient feasible ? III . Are patient need blood product transfusion possible identify transfuse prehospital phase/environment ? IV . Are out-of-hospital transfusion practice associate increase waste blood product ? All patient haemorrhagic shock needing volume replacement receive prehospital transfusion blood product include , fulfill list criterion : - Patients mechanism injury compatible severe haemorrhage and/or haemorrhagic shock ( e.g . penetrate torso injury , visible massive bleeding ) - Radial pulse &gt; 100 beats/min absent/weak radial pulse - Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 90 mmHg - Altered mental status ( reduce GCS ) absence head injury know intoxication Patients know previous serious allergic reaction blood product transfusion patient refuse blood product religious ground ( e.g . Jehovah´s Witness ) exclude .</detailed_description>
