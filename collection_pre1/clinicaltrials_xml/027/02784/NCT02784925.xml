	<brief_summary>Ultrasound ( US ) B mode image alternative method measure tissue structure proven accurate technique measure subcutaneous fat thickness . However , press transducer onto skin much force significantly reduce subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness . In study , force control system combine US transducer use 3D subcutaneous fat image reconstruction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The diagnosis fatty liver ( steatosis ) make fat liver exceeds 5-10 % weight . Fatty liver ( FL ) commonly associate alcohol metabolic syndrome ( diabetes , hypertension , obesity , dyslipidemia ) , also due one many cause . Most people detect serum lipid abnormality physical examination , confirm fatty liver disease ultrasound image . In previous study , ultrasound report provide accurate reliable measurement tool thickness measurement subcutaneous adipose tissue . This method overcome limitation skinfold thickness measurement . Ultrasound ( US ) B mode image alternative method measure tissue structure proven accurate technique measure subcutaneous fat thickness . However , press transducer onto skin much force significantly reduce subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness . In study , force control system combine US transducer use 3D subcutaneous fat image reconstruction . Finally , correlation body fat percentage subcutaneous fat steatosis patient investigate . The body fat percentage determine dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA , GE Lunar iDXA canner ) bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA , Omronï¼ŒHBF-370 ) , , correlation body fat percentage subcutaneous adipose tissue normal steatosis patient evaluate .</detailed_description>
