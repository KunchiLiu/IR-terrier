	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) disease important cause morbidity solid organ transplantation recipient remain common opportunistic viral infection patient . Standard CMV prevention strategy include universal prophylaxis pre-emptive therapy viral load monitoring . However , neither strategy successful eliminate CMV disease see high rate viremia , incidence , CMV recurrence despite treatment . Recently , Quantiferon-CMV assay show predict late CMV reactivation prophylaxis predictive viral progression need antiviral therapy organ transplant recipient develop low level CMV viremia . The purpose current study test clinical strategy use Quantiferon-CMV assay guide duration primary CMV prophylaxis solid organ transplant patient .</detailed_description>
