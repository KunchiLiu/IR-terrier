	<criteria>1 . Presence thoracic aortic pathology deem warrant surgical repair require proximal graft placement Zone 02 . 2 . Age ≥18 year time inform consent signature 3 . Subject capable complying protocol requirement , include followup 4 . Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) sign Subject legal representative 5 . Must appropriate proximal aortic land zone . 6 . Must appropriate target branch vessel land zone . 7 . For patient aneurysm/isolated lesion , must appropriate distal aortic land zone . 8 . Native aortic valve ( Zone 0/1 subject ) 9 . Subject consider high risk candidate conventional open surgical repair discretion Investigator ( Zone 0/1 subject ) 1 . Concomitant disease ascend aorta aneurysm abdominal aorta require repair 2 . Previous endovascular repair ascend aorta 3 . Previous endovascular repair DTA nonGore device 4 . Surgery within 30 day prior enrollment , exception surgery Ascending Aortic Dissection and/or placement vascular conduit access . 5 . Infected aorta 6 . Life expectancy &lt; 2 year 7 . Myocardial infarction within 6 week prior treatment 8 . Stroke within 6 week prior treatment , stroke define rapidly develop clinical sign focal ( global ) disturbance cerebral function , last 24 hour lead death , apparent cause vascular origin . 9 . Patient systemic infection may increase risk endovascular graft infection 10 . Pregnant female time inform consent signature 11 . Degenerative connective tissue disease , e.g . Marfan 's EhlerDanlos Syndrome 12 . Participation another drug medical device study within one year study enrollment 13 . Known history drug abuse within one year treatment 14 . Presence protrude and/or irregular thrombus and/or atheroma aortic arch ascend aorta 15 . Tortuous stenotic iliac and/or femoral artery prevent introducer sheath insertion inability use conduit vascular access 16 . Planned coverage celiac artery 17 . Patient known sensitivity allergies device material 18 . Patient known hypersensitivity contraindication anticoagulant contrast medium , amenable pretreatment 19 . Previous instance Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 ( HIT2 ) know hypersensitivity heparin 20 . Patient history hypercoagulability disorder and/or hypercoagulability state 21 . Diameter taper outside device size range proximal distal landing zone aorta inability use additional device different diameter compensate taper 22 . Mycotic aneurysm 23 . Persistent refractory shock ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg ) 24 . Patient body habitus medical condition prevents adequate visualization aorta 25 . Renal failure define patient estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 30 currently require dialysis 26 . Patient high risk neurological event , e.g . stroke</criteria>
