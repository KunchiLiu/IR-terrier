	<brief_summary>The purpose study estimate diagnostic accuracy cancer detection MIRA technology combine mammography , woman 30 year old undergoing screening mammography schedule image-guided needle biopsy due lesion detect image modality . The hypothesis breast cancer screen base functional imaging result early detection breast cancer , time predate mammographic conspicuity . In addition , breast cancer screen base functional imaging unaffected breast density . therefore , combination anatomic screening ( mammography ) functional image base screening ( MIRA ) result significantly high breast cancer detection rate woman dense breast tissue indicate need additional breast imaging technology , usually MRI .</brief_summary>
