	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) common gastrointestinal cancer Western country associate significant morbidity mortality . An intriguing similarity CRC PDAC fact newly develop immune checkpoint inhibitor , especially PD1/PDL1 inhibitor , seem limited efficacy single agent tumor type . Recent preclinical study point towards alternatively activate ( M2-type ) macrophages possible culprit induce local immune protection cytotoxic T cell resistance PD1/PD-L1 target agent . We hypothesize CSF1R blockade deplete tumor microenvironment M2 macrophage , thus favor induction cytotoxic anti-tumor T-cell response follow PD-L1 blockade anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody . So propose conduct Phase I dose escalation study order evaluate safety clinical activity combine treatment associate anti-CSF1R ( PEXIDARTINIB ) anti-PD-L1 ( DURVALUMAB ) patient advanced/metastatic colorectal pancreatic cancer . Dose escalation part determine Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) Pexidartinib give combination Durvalumab . Extension part evaluate clinical activity combination RP2D .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Activity Anti-PDL1 Antibody ( DURVALUMAB ) Combined With CSF-1R TKI ( PEXIDARTINIB ) Patients With Metastatic/Advanced Pancreatic Colorectal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 2-part Phase I study comprise dose-finding escalation part ( determine MTD/RP2D , safety PK ) follow extension part RP2D . In dose-escalation part , successive cohort 3 patient receive Pexidartinib ( give orally every day escalate dos , five dose level possible , Plexxikon ) , combination Durvalumab ( give IV every 4 week fix dose 1500mg , AstraZeneca ) . The dose escalation scheme do use Likelihood Continual Reassessment Method ( CRML ) . After new cohort 3 patient evaluate , model fit result discuss teleconference investigator , sponsor , representative AstraZeneca Plexxikon , statistician decide next dose assign next cohort ( Dose Escalation Meetings ) . In part , patient continue receive study drug long experience clinical benefit opinion investigator unacceptable toxicity include DLTs symptomatic deterioration attribute disease progression determine investigator integrate assessment radiographic data clinical status withdrawal consent . If DLT toxicity meeting DLT definition occur outside DLT period , resolve Grade ≤2 patient 's baseline level within 14 day toxicity onset , dose may resume agree Sponsor DL . The extension part comprise two independent cohort patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC cohort ) colorectal adenocarcinoma ( CRC cohort ) biopsiable disease , allow assessment anti-tumor activity base Gehan design allow quickly identify treatment low efficacy .</detailed_description>
