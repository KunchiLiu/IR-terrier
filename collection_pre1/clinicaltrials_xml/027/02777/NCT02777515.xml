	<detailed_description>I . Introduction The objective study evaluate acute cardiovascular effect electronic cigarette young patient non-invasive method . II . State question justification research State question Coronary artery disease death rate cause , responsible around 7 million death year , 12.8 % cause death . Myocardial infarction incidence 66/100 000 inhabitant per year . It undoubtedly recognize smoke major independent cardiovascular risk factor tobacco responsible 5 million death per year . Inhaled tobacco harmful contain several component : nicotine , tar derivative , derive free radical nitric oxide carbon monoxide . The acute effect smoke cardiovascular system complex . The effect coronary circulation characterize decreased blood flow intracoronary , particularly patient underlie coronary artery disease , exacerbate myocardial ischemia . There also detrimental effect systolic diastolic function leave ventricle , first flash . Tobacco alters peripheral resistance promotes secretion adrenergic catecholamine . Smoking cessation naturally public health priority remain difficult addictive nature nicotine . Thus several substitute cessation assistance develop , among electronic cigarette recent option , fashionable . Study Rationale The safety electronic cigarette establish yet . There rare small number study compare mostly acute cardiovascular effect electronic cigarette conventional cigarette without analyze potential consequence electronic cigarette . The smoke electronic cigarette mainly compose propylene glycol , also nicotine vary concentration . Propylene glycol use fill liquid electronic cigarette usually consider harmless inhale , despite cause asystole , shock decrease renal pulmonary arterial flow intravenous injection calf . It also use food industry emulsifier solvent certain liquid aroma . Its cardiovascular effect clearly study human . The interest study evaluate acute cardiovascular effect electronic cigarette , simple , non-invasive mean . III . population concern Defined th eligibility section . IV . Study Methodology Recruitment expect H1 2015 . Patients recruit Heart Rhythm consultation cardiovascular evaluation . We plan include minimum 20 subject . After first phase recruitment , data analysis conduct determine instead increase number subject include . A cardiovascular evaluation conduct baseline , include : 1 . A compendium history , general physical examination ( weight , height ) cardiovascular measurement oxygen saturation , assessment past current smoking ( documentation concentration nicotine electronic cigarette product brand use ) 2. measurement blood pressure 3 . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 4 . A Holter-ECG 10 minute 5 . A transthoracic echocardiogram The ECG analyze heart rate , time conduction repolarization ( QT interval particular ) . The Holter ECG study heart rate variability short time . Echocardiography ( 15 ) ass cardiac output : measurement sub aortic Integral time speed ITS diastolic function leave ventricle : measurement peak E wave 'and wave tissue Doppler mitral annulus ; mitral profile measurement peak E wave , deceleration time , peak A wave E / A ratio ; measure peak S wave D , pulmonary S / D ratio end-systolic end-diastolic volume leave ventricle assessment systolic leave ventricular function ( LVEF ) - systolic function right ventricle : measurement wave S tricuspid annulus tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE ) section 4 cavity , measure SPSP A recent study show significant level nicotine blood reach 10 puff right 10th minute first puff . This rate grow one hour , inhalation continue . For practical reason , ask subject smoke 15 minute usual pace . Cardiac evaluation describe repeat . The duration review two hour . To minimize bias , ECG , Holter-ECG echocardiography store anonymously interpret retrospectively physician blind patient 's identity time completion ( inhalation ) examination . V. Data Privacy Written information give . Her signed consent collect store . For subject identifier give exams inhalation another identifier give examination inhalation . These identifier grade handwritten sheet without data entry . The anonymous data enter computer file send statistician charge analysis . There exchange personal data . VI . Statistical analysis Quantitative variable express mean , standard deviation , minimum maximum value appropriate . The variable express number percentage . The purpose statistical analysis determine significant difference variable collect pre post-inhalation inhalation cigarette smoke electronic period . VII . Vigilance . definition i. adverse Event Any untoward medical occurrence occur person ready biomedical research event relate research ( x ) product ( ) ( ) ( ) door research . ii . Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) A serious event event : - The evolution fatal ; - Which endanger life person undergoing research ; - Which cause disability significant lasting disability ; - Causing hospitalization prolongation hospitalization ; - Which result abnormality birth defect ; - Any event meet qualification list , regard `` potentially serious '' include laboratory abnormality ; - Medically relevant event judgment investigator ; - Events require medical intervention prevent progression one aforementioned state . The term `` life-threatening '' reserve immediate life-threatening time adverse event , regardless consequence corrective palliative therapy . Certain circumstance require hospitalization within gravity standard `` inpatient / hospitalization extension '' : admission social administrative reason ; hospitalization predefined protocol ; hospitalization medical surgical treatment schedule prior research ; pass day hospital . b. detection method collection adverse event All adverse event investigate , report record , process evaluate first visit ( inclusion D0 ) end study resolution . Adverse event collect : - In clinical , biological plan systematic examination investigator ; - By spontaneous reporting participant , instruct contact investigate doctor case adverse event . All adverse event record form adverse event case report form ( see Appendix 2 ) . Each observed adverse event record individually . The intensity adverse event determine follow : - Mild ( grade 1 ) : interference daily activity patient ; - Moderate ( grade 2 ) : Moderate interference patient 's daily activity still acceptable ; - Severe ( grade 3 ) significant interference patient 's daily activity unacceptable ; - Threat life-threatening ( grade 4 ) ; - Death ( Grade 5 ) . All adverse event must grade . Responsibilities investigator . . Declaration SAEs The investigator evaluate adverse event relation severity . The investigator must notify fax ( 01 44 12 31 40 ) sponsor ( CRC GHPSJ ) without delay day hear , serious adverse event trial , except identify protocol require immediate reporting . This initial notification subject write report must follow necessary one report ( ) Additional ( ) writing ( ) Main ( ) within 8 day first declaration ( Declaration Form Annex 3 Protocol ) . The investigator must document best event ( thanks copy laboratory result report examination hospitalization account inform serious event , include relevant negative result , forget make document anonymous register number patient 's code ) , medical diagnosis causal link serious adverse event research . The statement send developer serious adverse event report form sign date . The investigator follow patient SAE resolution , stabilization level deem acceptable investigator return previous state , even patient test inform promoter ( CRC GHPSJ ) fax 01 44 31 December 40 form ( check : monitoring ) . ii . Assessment causality The investigator assess causality adverse event research . The causal link binary ( connect / connect ) . iii . Reporting period follow term adverse event The investigator report serious adverse event inclusion patient end experimental procedure . The investigator monitor adverse event resolution stabilization even patient study . iv . Special case 2.4.1 Serious Events immediately declare To extent expect serious adverse event relate participation patient study certain serious adverse event know associated patient 's usual care may arise , therefore require immediate declaration accordance health authority . c. Responsibilities promoter The Promoter declare ANSM ( French Health Authorities ) CPP ( patient protection committee ) accordance law 9 August 2004 : â€¢ unexpected serious adverse reaction without delay late within seven calendar day day sponsor becomes aware , within 7 day monitoring , - development without delay safety late within 7 calendar day , within 7 day monitoring , - annual safety report within 60 calendar day anniversary date study . d. Establishment independent oversight committee To extent expect serious adverse event relate participation patient study , want establish independent monitoring committee . VIII . Funding No external funding GHPSJ . IX . Conflicts interest No conflict interest</detailed_description>
