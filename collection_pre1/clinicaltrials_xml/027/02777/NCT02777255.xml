	<brief_title>Severe CAV MRI Heart Transplant Recipient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) major limitation longevity heart transplantation ( HT ) , account almost 30 % deaths year 5 . The cure re-transplant associate 30-day mortality 30 % , raise ethical issue due limited resource . Standard preventive measure , statin therapy , limited success due multi-factorial nature process influence transplant-specific risk factor . Consensus regard management CAV lacking due absence prospective study evaluate time initiation therapy , effect therapy long-term outcome , effective diagnostic strategy . Primary prevention CAV , evaluate propose study , could improve longevity heart transplant recipient optimize use limited resource . The current gold standard evaluation CAV surveillance coronary angiogram , highly insensitive , particularly early disease . Intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) sensitive tool diagnosis CAV , provide specific information appearance thickness intima medium , however widely use clinical setting . Physiologic study coronary artery also useful assess risk , practical clinical setting . These invasive study expose heart transplant recipient radiation , nephrotoxic contrast , potential vascular complication . During evolution CAV , important structural , functional , genomic change occur parallel possibly . Study Objectives 1 . Determine structural , functional genomic change associate severe CAV 2 . Identify novel noninvasive marker CAV Study Design This cross-sectional study evaluate structural , functional genomic change associate severe CAV heart transplant recipient within 15 year transplant . 30 heart transplant recipient identify via study database transplant clinic enrol study . We enroll 15 heart transplant patient severe CAV 15 without CAV . Subjects undergo one-time assessment radial artery elasticity , blood draw gene expression profile , cardiac MRI .</detailed_description>
