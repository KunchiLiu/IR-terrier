	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate Carboxipeptidase D ( CPD ) genotyping predictive biomarker body weight and/or fat mass reduction obese patient treat perindopril . There nonclinical clinical evidence subgroup human subject may present decrease body weight and/or fat mass follow treatment perindopril . Although individual characteristic determine effect still unknown , Gene PreDiT SA ( Biocant Park , Cantanhede , Portugal ) discover certain genetic characteristic ( e.g. , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) CPD gene ) may play role potentially could serve potential predictive biomarker response perindopril . These promising result , along fact perindopril medicine already use clinical practice , lead Gene PreDiT SA decide proceed development theranostic approach treatment obesity . Such theranostic approach consist use CPD genotyping identify obese subject could present improve body weight fat mass reduction follow treatment perindopril . The current clinical trial aim prove concept provide data design confirmatory study . Additionally study evaluate association CPD SNPs genotypes response perindopril ; effect perindopril waist circumference , waist/hip ratio , BMI tolerability safety perindopril study population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist 2 period 4 visit ( V ) : run-in period least 4 week ( V1 V2 ) 12-week perindopril treatment period ( V2 V4 ) . After write informed consent , patient undergo screen evaluation ( V1 ) . Patients meet selection criterion enter run-in period 4 week give dietary exercise counsel standardized non-drug therapy . After run-in period ( V2 ) , patient start pharmacological therapy period receive perindopril 8 mg , daily , 12 week , concomitantly previously establish standardized non-drug therapy . During 12-week pharmacological treatment , patient attend intermediate study visit ( V3 ) approximately 6 week final visit ( V4 ) efficacy safety assessment . Body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist hip circumference , body fat mass estimation assess every study visit . A total 160 subject enrol , approximately 120 subject evaluable . After V2 , patient administer perindopril 8 mg , daily , 12 week , concomitantly previously establish standardized non-pharmacological therapy . Blood sample clinical safety laboratory assessment ( hematology plasma biochemistry ) collect screening , end run-in period , intermediate treatment visit , end perindopril treatment period . At screen , blood also collect CPD genotyping , result remain blinded database closure . Safety evaluate assessment treatment-emergent adverse event , vital sign clinical laboratory test . Adverse event monitor throughout study . Vital sign record schedule visit . Clinical safety laboratory parameter collect screening , end run-in period , intermediate treatment visit , end treatment period . Abnormalities vital sign laboratory parameter assess clinical investigator term clinical relevance . Clinically significant abnormality clinical laboratory vital sign report adverse event . Associations CPD SNPs genotypes patient response assess appropriate statistical method . The primary efficacy analysis compare response rate group subject SNPs interest group remain subject . A logistic regression model use assess group difference . Weight fat mass start perindopril treatment period gender use covariates . Other covariates investigate exploratory purpose , include model main treatment effect test compare . All secondary efficacy endpoint assess use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . In general , principle apply primary efficacy analysis replicate secondary efficacy analysis . Adverse event tabulate summarize accord system organ class ( SOC ) prefer term ( PT ) .</detailed_description>
