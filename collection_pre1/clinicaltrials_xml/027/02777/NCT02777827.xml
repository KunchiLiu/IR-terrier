	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate pharmacodynamics single dos abediterol give 2 different device participant asthma . Abediterol ( AZD0548 ) potential daily treatment asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fix dose combination ( FDC ) inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) novel anti-inflammatory agent . The aim clinical study enable investigation participant asthma COPD evaluate develop abediterol effective long act bronchodilator acceptable safety profile compare inhaled bronchodilator market , treatment asthma COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Dose PD &amp; PK Study With Two Formulations Abediterol Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double-blinded , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , multi-centre , six-way William 's design , crossover study ass pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics , safety abediterol single dose , give dry powder inhaler pressurise metered-dose inhaler , patient asthma , inhaled corticosteroid . During screen period , patient take baseline inhale corticosteroid 2 week . Patients long-acting β2-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroid switch respective inhaled corticosteroid monocomponent . Patients provide salbutamol rescue medication use throughout study . Abediterol investigational product early stage clinical development , therefore individual participant clinical study may clinical benefit , especially view alternative therapy ( bronchodilator ) available treatment asthma COPD .</detailed_description>
