The 1200 random number sort descend order categorize 3 equal group : - ID number first group ( n = 400 ) allocate control group - ID number second group ( n = 400 ) allocate e-mental health program - ID number third group ( n = 400 ) allocate e-mental health group plus job coaching . The Excel sheet ID number random number keep printed randomization . For example , participant 3rd one completes online survey , determined date completion . The project coordinator search ID # 3 Excel sheet . The ID # 3 second group . This participant assign group receive e-mental health program . The date randomization document .

Over course trial , principal investigator ( PI ) research staff examine data regular basis run cross tabulation , frequency distribution estimation mean proportion ensure quality data identify miss value potential outlier . If miss value outlier find , record refer back interviewer clarification call-back . After 12-month interview , participant ' group status link interview data study identification ( ID ) number . Over study period , investigator interviewer conduct follow-up interview Calgary access participant ' group status . The interviewer conduct baseline assessment randomization , involve follow-up interview . The PI project coordinator responsible maintain data data quality control . A sub-committee form trial .
