	<criteria>1 . Persons paraplegia least 1 year post SCI . Prior time patient still adjust independent function manual wheelchair primary mean mobility . This criterion ensure subject sufficient exposure functional demand associate condition . 2 . Age 21 60 year old ; age 21 , particularly male , humeral growth plate may fully close . Including subject age ensure skeletal maturity . After age 60 , even ablebodied individual , substantial degenerative change begin occur shoulder joint . 3 . Use manual wheelchair primary mean mobility ( &gt; 50 % time ) . This population risk development shoulder pain associate secondary complication . 4 . A history unilateral bilateral shoulder pain interferes least one functional task . Symptoms localize proximal anterior , lateral , posterior glenohumeral ( shoulder joint ) region require . Rotator cuff tendinopathy `` impingement '' syndrome involve localize pain region . More diffuse symptom consistent combine shoulder/neck syndrome radiate pain cervical spine pathology . 1 . Inability provide inform consent . 2 . Reproduction shoulder pain , pain radiate upper extremity , numbness tingle upper extremity , upper extremity symptom cervical screen examination thoracic outlet test . This result would indicative primary cervical thoracic outlet pathology . 3 . Shoulder pain traumatic origin . Cumulative trauma disorder primary interest amenable propose exercise intervention . 4 . History shoulder surgery dislocation . 5 . Recent history fracture ( within 1 year ) , hospitalization ( within past month ) , cortisone injection shoulder ( within 4 month ) . These condition may interfere safe effective completion exercise intervention . 6 . A diagnosis image finding rheumatoid arthritis , end stage osteoarthritis , full thickness rotator cuff tear , adhesive capsulitis , complex regional pain syndrome . These subject may joint disease progression severe , appropriately treat stretch strengthen intervention . 7 . Diagnosed major depression , alcohol substance abuse , serious medical condition . These condition may prevent subject regularly complete exercise intervention All criterion apply group except manual wheelchair use SCI criterion applicable able body subject group .</criteria>
