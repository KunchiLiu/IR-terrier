	<brief_summary>Several report indicate treatment failure due HIV resistance adverse event-related discontinuation could compromise effectiveness scaling-up antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) , especially lack access viral load concern . Combined nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , Dolutegravir ( DTG ) promise alternative current first-line non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen . Initial evaluation DTG conduct high income country show excellent efficacy safety indicate high genetic barrier thus preserve second line treatment . As consequence , DTG-based regimen recently include first-line option national guideline ART several high-income country . However , clinical trial evaluate DTG-based regimen conduct highly controlled condition , include baseline resistance test regular viral load monitoring . Moreover , trial include high proportion men rare co-morbidities . There need evaluate DTG-based regimen perform real-world condition within resources-constrained setting , viral load monitoring limit , majority HIV patient woman important family plan consideration NAMSAL trial randomize clinical trial aim evaluate efficacy safety 48 week DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine versus Efavirenz ( EFV ) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine 606 ART-naïve HIV-1-infected adult Cameroon . A set efficacy safety endpoint compare 48 week two arm include proportion patient viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL incidence severe adverse event .</brief_summary>
