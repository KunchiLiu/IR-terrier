	<brief_summary>The purpose research study intend use specimen ( tissue ) medical information Laboratory Musculoskeletal Oncology Van Andel Research Institute laboratory research Grand Rapids , Michigan . Small tissue sample cutaneous neurofibroma collect part research . The sample help researcher learn cutaneous neurofibroma help well understand NF1 . There many different type study , future , do use specimen receive . These include use specimen information look new way diagnose treat Neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) . The specimen may use study gene affect health disease , gene affect way disease condition respond treatment . Some study may lead new product , treatment test disease . Through study , hope find good way understand treat NF1 future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Skin tumor Neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) common diminish quality life . Apart surgery , treatment option exist . In comparison type tumor NF1 , skin tumor receive less attention research world almost never turn cancer . Under microscope , skin tumor plexiform tumor look similar , however share growth potential , appear time development . These difference suggest skin tumor drive different factor plexiform tumor . In study harvest CNFs 3 group subject order obtain minimum 18 tumor three size category : &lt; 5mm , 5-10mm , &gt; 1cm . These size select base variable natural history CNF progression incipient lesion ( typically &lt; 5mm ) numerous demonstrate less aggressive growth pattern , whereas intermediate group ( 5-10mm ) represent transition state towards growth large ( &gt; 1cm ) lesion . Interestingly , CNF growth tend stall 3cm . We plan experiment identify factor important CNF progression , find matching drug shrink tumor .</detailed_description>
