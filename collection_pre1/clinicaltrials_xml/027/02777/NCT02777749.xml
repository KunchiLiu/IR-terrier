	<brief_summary>The objective study compare efficacy adductor canal block versus periarticular bupivacaine injection pain management total knee arthroplasty . This randomized clinical trial compare outcomes adductor canal block , periarticular bupivacaine injection , periarticular liposomal bupivacaine injection . Results study help determine appropriate perioperative pain management strategy patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adductor Canal Block Versus Periarticular Bupivicaine Injection Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 600,000 total knee arthroplasty ( TKAs ) perform year United States , expectation great 4 million/year year 2030 . Since onset TKAs 1960 's , development improve functionality patient satisfaction . In last decade , focus make multimodal pain management protocol , rapid functional recovery , reduce length hospital stay , minimize side effect treatment maintain function durability . The widespread use regional anesthesia lead improvement pain control , rapid functional recovery , reduce length stay . In recent year many surgeon transition femoral nerve block ( proximal femoral nerve ) adductor canal block ( distal femoral nerve ) maintain sensory block pain control , minimize motor blockade typically see proximal femoral nerve block , would hamper rehabilitation , increase risk fall . In addition regional block , typically perform preoperative setting , surgeon favor intraoperative periarticular anesthetic injection ( PAI ) , typically bupivacaine long act form liposomal bupivacaine , either conjunction adductor canal block , independently . In theory , PAI advantage comparable sensory nerve block adductor canal block , without disadvantage risk , include prolonged quadriceps weakness , fall risk , neurologic dysfunction . The purpose randomize control trial compare efficacy adductor canal block versus periarticular bupivacaine injection pain management total knee arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
