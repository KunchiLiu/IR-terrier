	<detailed_description>Among woman PMDD ( premenstrual mood dysphoric disorder ) , baseline arousal heighten luteal phase menstrual cycle compare follicular phase , measure acoustic startle response ( ASR ) . Healthy female control show cyclic change measure physiologic arousal . It suggest heighten physiologic arousal luteal phase may due difference neurosteroid modulation GABA-A receptor function . Research indicate woman premenstrual mood disorder ( PMDs ) may sub-optimal sensitivity progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone ( ALLO ) , GABA-A receptor modulator . In animal model , intracerebroventricular injection corticotrophin release factor ( CRF ) increase amplitude acoustic startle response , ALLO administration attenuate CRF-enhanced startle . CRF-enhanced startle mediate bed nucleus stria terminalis ( BNST ) . Thus , ALLO appear impact BNST anxiety , versus amygdala acute fear . The propose study examine anticipatory anxiety cue fear baseline SSRI treatment . The magnitude ASR former manipulation would reflect BNST activity hypothesize dysregulated woman PMDD . Secondary aim examine impact luteal phase treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) psychophysiology woman PMDs examine relationship affective symptom , stress regulation immune function among woman , well association hormone level genetic marker .</detailed_description>
