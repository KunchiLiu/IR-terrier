	<brief_summary>The foramen ovale , kind physiologic channel interatrial septum heart embryonic stage , close normally 5-7 month birth . When close , refer patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) , find approximately 1/4 general population . It show study recent year risk cryptogenic stroke , migraine , peripheral arterial embolism decompression sickness patient PFO several time higher healthy people . Therefore , PFO , previously consider condition without necessity treatment , cause attention many expert scholar around world . Migraine without aura define one disable chronic disease , since accord WHO , disability adjust life year cause migraine second non-fatal stroke 2005 . In recent year , increase number research suggest migraine closely related right-to-left shunt ( RLS ) heart . And PFO clinically consider common cause RLS . The closure treatment PFO-induced migraine gradually apply several hospital China . The relationship PFO migraine , however , evaluate systematically base specific standard , unfortunately lead non-inclusion many high-risk patient PFO evaluation . The following aspect fully recognize : select screen procedure high-risk population PFO-induced migraine ; indication standard closure treatment PFO patient PFO-induced migraine ; possibility made-in-China occluders substitute import prevention migraine . Furthermore , still lack prospective , multi-center , randomize controlled study subject , standard normal screen treatment procedure yet establish China . From point , investigator develop Chinese people-specific procedure standard diagnosis PFO-induced migraine study , base current standard method diagnosis , treatment prevention PFO-induced migraine foreign country . And investigator prospectively adopt continuous inclusion high-risk patient PFO-induced migraine , randomly divide closure treatment ( transcatheter closure PFO ) group medication ( drug administer alone ) group ratio 1:1. , order evaluate interventional treatment good medication alone patient , assess efficacy safety made-in-China occluders interventional treatment prevention PFO-induced migraine , identify incidence PFO patient migraine China develop Chinese people-specific screening protocol PFO-induced migraine .</brief_summary>
