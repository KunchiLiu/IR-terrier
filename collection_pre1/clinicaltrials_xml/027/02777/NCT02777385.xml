	<brief_summary>The study regimen consist cisplatin radiation patient , standard treatment head neck cancer . All patient also receive pembrolizumab ( study drug ) , randomize two treatment schedule : either pembrolizumab cisplatin-radiation , pembrolizumab complete cisplatin-radiation . The goal research study learn therapy order ( add pembrolizumab vs. cisplatin radiation ) may effective treat head neck cancer , well learn side effect combinations.Pembrolizumab immune therapy , drug stimulates immune system fight cancer , FDA approve lung cancer melanoma . It currently FDA approve head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
