	<brief_summary>Intra-spinal canal tumor general term primary tumor spinal cord various tissue spinal canal adjacent spinal cord , metastatic tumor sit spinal canal . Intra-spinal canal tumor one common diseases neurosurgery , surgery effective treatment . Conventional open surgery require remove posterior structure spine , would lead fracture posterior tension band , soft tissue injury , spine instability , even spine deformity . So important protect rebuild posterior tension band stability spine . The team Dr. John P. Kostuik Department Orthopedics Neurosurgery , Johns Hopkins University , firstly introduce minimally invasive surgery cervical lumbar degenerative disease . However applied treatment intra-spinal canal tumor . To date , microsurgery intra-spinal tumor trans-Quadrant channel pathway widely perform clinical practice . The investigator perform microsurgery intra-spinal canal tumor trans-Quadrant pathway patient previously succeed surgical treatment . The investigator analyze clinical data retrospectively , include surgical incision length , volume bleed operation , post-operative drainage volume , post-operative out-of-bed time point , post-operative length stay hospital , post-operative visual analog pain ( VAP ) score . The group patient use microsurgical technique trans-Quadrant channel pathway show well outcome compare group patient use conventional open surgery . This innovation microsurgery show few trauma bleeding , rapid recovery , good prognosis safety practice . Since limitation retrospective study , necessary design prospective randomize controlled trial treatment intra-spinal canal tumor use microsurgical technique trans-Quadrant channel pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment Intra-spinal Canal Tumors Via Trans-Quadrant Channel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize control clinical trial . 1 . Patient Recruitment : Patients meet diagnostic criterion intra-spinal canal tumor surgical indication May 2016 June 2018 department neurosurgery hospital could recruit . 2 . Screening : Demographic characteristic , gender , age , history disease ( include limit diabetes , heart disease , smoke history , operation history , etc . ) , related laboratory test ( blood rout test , liver kidney function , electrolyte , blood coagulation function , ECG , etc . ) enter either group . 3 . Grouping : Patients meet diagnostic criterion meet exclusion criterion would assign experimental group control group randomly . The informed consent form sign group . 4 . Surgery : Patients experimental group receive operation use microsurgical technique trans-Quadrant channel pathway . Patients control group receive conventional open surgery . 5 . Post-operative Observation Follow-up : Clinical data collect surgery follow-up . The time point include 1st day , 7th day , 30th day , 90th day , 180th day surgery . 6 . Statistical Analysis : Statisticians blind clinical data grouping . The software SPSS ( V. 16.0 ) use statistic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient meet diagnostic criterion intraspinal canal tumor indication surgery . Meanwhile , length tumor 5 cm , crosssectional area le 2/3 respective area spinal canal . The patient never treat spinal surgery . There cognitive impairment onset diseases disease cause cognitive dysfunction . The patient sign inform consent form . The patient diagnozed non intraspinal canal tumor , spinal degenerative disease , spinal disease . The patient receive spinal surgery previously . The patient suffer serious heart , lung , liver , kidney insufficiency . The patient spinal spinal cord diseases rather intraspinal canal tumor , disc herniation , vertebral fracture . The patient severe diabetes , coronary heart disease , coagulation disorder , difficult correct operation , tolerate surgery . The patient surgical contraindication . The patient pregnant breastfeeding . The patient unable sign inform consent voluntarily .</criteria>
