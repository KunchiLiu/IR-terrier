	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery powerful tool produce significant durable weight loss . Yet , patient achieve initial weight loss success many patient weight regain early 1-2 year post-surgery . Suboptimal weight loss pattern fully explain surgical , demographic , medical factor lead great emphasis patient behavior evidence clinical guideline focus appropriate eating physical activity . However , research inform guideline typically relied imprecise measure specific bariatric surgery . There also little understanding mechanism psychosocial factor influence outcomes . Thus , need : ( ) measure behavior psychosocial factor think related surgical outcome ( particularly emphasize guideline ) use innovative strategy maximize data quality , ( b ) determine behavior psychosocial factor relate outcome , ( c ) explore psychosocial factor influence weight directly via influence behavior . Our research team first employ innovative mobile health ( mHealth ) technology within Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) framework measure adherence recommend behavior 6 month post-surgery . The investigator propose build work use EMA measure behavioral , psychosocial , environmental factor longer period understand predict success risk surgery . An NIH-funded multi-sensor PiLR HEALTH platform integrate objective sensor data measure behavior environment perform self-report information collect via smartphone real-time patient ' natural environment . Participants ( N=100 ) recruit 2 ASMBS-designated center excellence complete 10-day EMA protocol pre-surgery 3 , 6 , 12 month post-surgery ass recommend behavior [ e.g. , meal frequency , PA ] , psychosocial indicator prior evidence association surgical outcome ( e.g. , mood/depression ) , key environmental factor ( e.g. , type/quality food environment ) . Participants also weigh time point . Along describe pattern behavior relation weight loss , investigator test causal model understand complex system behavioral , psychosocial , environmental factor affect weight loss , identify optimal target intervention . This project potential build much sophisticated valid understanding successful bariatric surgery . This new understand directly contribute improve ( i.e. , specific , consistent , validate ) guideline recommend pre postoperative behavior , could lead improved surgical outcome . The enhanced understanding also inform behavioral , psychosocial , environmental target intervention mostly likely improve surgical outcome .</brief_summary>
