	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyoma ( fibroid ) non-cancerous smooth muscle tumor cause heavy menstrual bleeding , pain , pressure . Common surgical treatment modality hysterectomy ( removal uterus ) myomectomy ( removal fibroid ) . Minimally invasive surgical technique ( laparoscopy ) generally recommend due improve recovery time , decrease infection risk , decrease bleeding risk overall decrease morbidity mortality risk . In order remove large uterus large fibroid laparoscopically , power morcellator often use cut specimen small piece remove small incision . Due concern regard spread small amount tissue power morcellation , many surgeon advocate contained power morcellation , i.e . morcellation inside specimen bag . This study evaluate efficacy contain morcellation use two specific specimen bag . There two arm study , one utilizing bag . Morcellation perform designate bag . The bag remove evaluated egg albumin leakage . If leakage , inferred tissue spread contain morcellation process use bag .</detailed_description>
