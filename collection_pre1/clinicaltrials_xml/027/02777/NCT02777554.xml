	<brief_summary>This study conduct 2 Parts . The purpose study measure much apremilast find blood administer daily tablet compare twice day tablet , give multiple dos ( Part 1 ) administer single dose fast feed condition ( Part 2 ) . Information safety tolerability apremilast also obtain . In addition , effect apremilast certain biomarkers blood evaluated 16 assigned subject ( Part 1 ) . Biomarkers substance protein tell u study drug work body . Part 1 : This multi-center , phase 1 , open-label , randomize , two-period , two-sequence , crossover study healthy subject . The study consist screen phase , baseline phase , two treatment period , follow-up phone call . Each Period ten day duration ( Day 1 Day 10 ) dose sample collection 72 hour post Day 7 morning dose Periods 1 2 . There washout Period 1 Period 2 . Part 2 : This single center , open-label , randomize , four-period , four-sequence crossover study evaluate PK exposure apremilast follow single dose administration different formulation apremilast . Part 2 consist Screening phase , Baseline , four Treatment period , follow-up phone call . Each Period four day duration ( Day 1 Day 4 ) dose sample collection 72 hour post Day 1 Period 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Part 1 Primary Objectives To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) exposure apremilast follow multiple-dose administration QD apremilast formulation relative BID reference IR tablet feed condition standard meal . Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety tolerability QD apremilast formulation BID reference IR tablet . Exploratory Objective To evaluate pharmacodynamics ( PD ) apremilast follow multiple-dose administration QD apremilast formulation relative BID reference IR tablet feed condition standard meal . Part 2 Primary Objectives To estimate PK exposure apremilast follow single dose administration QD apremilast formulation relative BID reference IR tablet fast condition To estimate effect food PK single oral dose QD apremilast formulation . Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety tolerability QD apremilast formulation BID reference IR tablet .</detailed_description>
