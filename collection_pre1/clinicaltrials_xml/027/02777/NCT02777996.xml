	<detailed_description>ITALUNG RCT evaluation lo efficacy lung cancer screen low-dose CT carry three screen center Florence , Pisa Pistoia district Tuscany region Italy . The study completely fund Regional Health Public Authority approve Local Ethic Committee participate institution . The study involve 269 general practitioner ( GPs ) operate 3 district , one screening centre district , CT scan clinical management perform , Institute Cancer Prevention Research ( CSPO ) Florence coordinate centre . Methods The base subject recruitment list subject 55-69 year range resident one 3 district screen centre locate register one GPs accept participate study . These subject receive letter sign GP local screening centre aim characteristic study explain standardized multiple choice questionnaire age , gender , smoke history , general health information enclose . The candidate ask sign consent randomize send letter back coordinate centre mail , free charge , give questionnaire back his/her GP . Only subject registered participate GPs give letter back consent randomization enrol trial . The consent enrol randomize contain initial mail consent follow GP . All respondent sign consent know eligibility randomization status . Eligible study subject age 55 69 year time enrolment smoke history least 20 packs-year since last 10 year ( former smoker quit since 10 year exclude ) . Other exclusion criterion history previous cancer non-melanoma skin cancer general condition preclude thoracic surgery . Eligible subject centrally randomise software procedure active arm receive annual low-dose CT 4 year control arm receive usual care screen . Subjects randomize control arm receive letter communicate allocation screen arm study invitation free access smoke cessation program . Subjects randomized active arm contact phone call appointment interview pneumologist provide information CT scan positive finding management collect consent CT examination schedule CT screen test . An additional write consent enrolment biomarkers collateral research project also request . A free-access invitation smoke cessation program provide subject enrol study . All randomised subject follow cancer registry Tuscany Region ( http : //www.ispo.it/ ) incidence mortality . Furthermore enrol subject his/her GP interview telephone 4 year since randomisation ass health condition smoke habit . We consider subject withdraw screen process whatever time randomisation drop-outs.The CT screening test perform use five spiral CT scanner include one single row detector ( SD ) four multi-rows detector ( MD ) . Low-dose acquisition technique follow international recommendation include 120-140 kilovolt peak ( kVp ) , 20-43 milliampere ( mA ) bone reconstruction filter . Slice collimation 3 mm 1.5 mm reconstruction interval SD scanner 1-1.25 1-1.25 mm reconstruction interval MD scanner . Each CT scan read independently two radiologist work-station consensus reach case disagreement . Three radiologist perform first reading , 15 additional radiologist perform second reading . All 18 radiologist minimum 4 year experience chest CT . Within next 3 week result baseline screen test mail home negative , whereas subject positive test receive phone call local screening centre invite meet pneumologist assessment.The main criterion test evaluation nodule size , measure manually electronic calliper workstation . CT scan consider negative focal abnormality find also solid non-calcified nodule ( NCN ) &lt; 5 mm mean diameter pure non-solid nodule mean diameter &lt; 10 mm observe . In case negative baseline screen test subject schedule annual repeat screen test.The test consider positive demonstrate least one NCN ≥ 5 mm non-solid nodule ≥ 10 mm presence part-solid nodule . Management positive screen test carry screen centre accord share protocol basically similar International-Early Lung Cancer Action Program ( ELCAP ) Study use follow-up low-dose CT , fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) , fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy . In particular , solid NCN mean diameter ≥ 8 non- solid NCN &gt; 10 mm schedule FDG-PET examination . In PET positive nodule FNA recommend , whereas 3-month follow-up perform PET negative case . A 3-month follow- also request nodule negative indeterminate FNA . All case show nodule growth follow-up examination invite annual repeat CT scan . Solid part-solid NCN mean diameter 5 7 mm receive follow-up low-dose CT scan three month . In case significant growth , define increase least 1 mm mean diameter solid nodule increase solid component part-solid nodule , nodule consider potentially malignant . For peripheral nodule two option available : FDG-PET CT-guided FNA . In case deep nodule FDG-PET fiberoptic BronchoScopy ( FBS ) perform case-by-case basis . FBS also occasion- ally perform case airways abnormality . If screening test reveal focal abnormality consistent inflammatory disease , antibiotic therapy 1-month follow-up CT recommend . In case complete resolution , subject send annual repeat screening , whereas 2-month follow-up CT perform case partial lack resolution . All subject FNA evidence malignancy underwent stag CT include full-dose chest , upper abdomen head examination intravenous iodinate contrast administration . Surgery recommend nodule finding consistent malignancy FNA also two subject PET positive FNA indeterminate solid nodule.All surgically remove lesion evaluate accord World Health Organization Criteria ] . Blood sputum sample store Active arm Biobank , 1304 subject enrol Italung Biomarker study .</detailed_description>
