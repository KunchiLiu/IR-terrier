	<detailed_description>Adipose tissue highly dynamic organ produce wide array adipokines affect function tissue throughout body . The physiology adipose tissue relatively new excite area research researcher learn complexity , particular way adipose tissue play dynamic active role various normal pathological process . Comparatively little known change occur within adipose tissue natural course age - adipose dysfunction could play role ageing-related chronic systemic inflammatory disease type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . In study , investigator would like investigate inflammatory metabolic change occur within adipose tissue age . investigator would also like examine whether age-related change adipose tissue specific particular tissue type compare adipose-resident immune cell population measure inflammation metabolism muscle tissue blood . By explore immune dysfunction occur age adipose tissue relate inflammatory metabolic difference muscle blood , work may potentially reveal causal mechanism development ageing-related chronic inflammatory disease ultimately lead development well treatment/management strategy . BACKGROUND Adipose tissue sizeable endocrine organ highly dynamic , produce wide array adipokines affect range physiological process include regulation appetite , energy expenditure , insulin sensitivity , inflammation , endocrine reproductive system bone metabolism . Ageing process associate adipose tissue accumulation , change adipose tissue distribution dysfunction turn link development chronic inflammatory disorder type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . Adipose tissue inflammation may key Adipose tissue consist adipocytes , also many cell type include endothelial cell , preadipocytes , immune cell macrophages lymphocyte adipocytes may represent 60-70 % cell number adipose tissue . Research last decade suggest presence immune cell within adipose tissue important regulate local systemic inflammation/production adipokines . For example , adipose tissue macrophage contribute majority pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFÎ± ~50 % IL6 secrete adipose tissue , show increase secretion adipose tissue dysfunction implicate development chronic inflammatory disorder . Changes adipose resident immune cell relatively well studied obesity comparatively study human examine change immune cell population potential impact adipose tissue inflammation context ageing . Given time-course adipose tissue accumulation obesity compare ageing , potential difference underlie mechanism adipose tissue dysfunction occur . In human , overwhelm evidence ( include work investigator 's group ) macrophages accumulate subcutaneous adipose tissue obesity important mediator adipose tissue inflammation . Additionally , work perform group also show T cell adipose tissue activate obesity may also related level adipose tissue inflammation . Only one study attempt investigate impact age immune cell adipose tissue , however , specific population ( Pima Indians ) up-to age 45 year know immune cell change increase age chronic inflammatory disorder become prevalent . Studies use mouse model indeed suggest discrepancy immune cell population within adipose tissue follow diet-induced obesity compare age . In mouse , clear change number change anti- pro-inflammatory phenotype would contrast obesity , evidence increase number skew towards pro-inflammatory phenotype . Mice also show increase T-cells adipose tissue age - especially T-regulatory cell , however , diet-induced obesity may increase number pro-inflammatory effector cell ( e.g . CD8+ ) . The potential role adipose tissue inflammation development age-related chronic inflammatory disorder compare investigator ' previous work context obesity something investigator keen address present study . Investigating tissue specific change age With age increase deposition adipose tissue within muscle profound effect muscle tissue include induce insulin resistance lipotoxicity . Considering muscle one major site glucose uptake , impairment process profound effect systemic glucose concentration whole body insulin resistance . Like adipose tissue , muscle host resident immune cell , know whether differ term proportion function find adipose tissue . Furthermore , know immune cell muscle tissue may affect local systemic inflammation development ageing-related chronic inflammatory disease . It important consider role different tissue disorder affect body whole may specific response age need consider try understand underlie pathophysiology ageing-related chronic disease . Thus , impact age muscle immune cell inflammation another factor investigator keen address present study . investigator especially interested examine whether age affect adipose muscle similar different way . Purpose The purpose study investigate inflammatory metabolic change adipose tissue occur age compare change muscle blood . By compare metabolic inflammatory parameter within adipose tissue , muscle circulation young old individual , investigator hope gain vital clue regard potential pathogenic mechanism involve development ageing-related chronic inflammatory disease . With great understand mechanism investigator hope prepare ground new effective mean prevention/treatments ageing-related chronic inflammatory disease .</detailed_description>
