	<brief_summary>This study determine meter dose inhaler effective breath actuate nebulizer treatment mild moderate asthma exacerbation pediatric patient present emergency department . Half participate patient receive albuterol via meter dose inhaler whereas half receive albuterol via breath actuate nebulizer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing Metered Dose Inhalers Breath Actuated Nebulizers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Albuterol administer via meter dose inhaler spacers effective small volume nebulizer treatment acute pediatric asthma exacerbation . There also support data breath actuate nebulizer also effective small volume nebulizer . The effectiveness breath actuate nebulization compare MDI treat asthma exacerbation less well define . This first prospective study demonstrate meter dose inhaler non-inferior breath actuate nebulizer treatment mild moderate asthma exacerbation pediatric patient present emergency department . Metered dose inhaler spacers readily available general population , easily transportable require power source . Demonstrating equal effectiveness albuterol delivery system treatment acute pediatric asthma exacerbation would enable physician confidently utilize clinical encounter opportunity educate family management asthma exacerbation use home appliance .</detailed_description>
