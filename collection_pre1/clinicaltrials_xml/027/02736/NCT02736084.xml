	<brief_summary>The investigator develop novel , telephone-based , 12-week positive psychology intervention assess feasibility short-term impact adult type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) suboptimal health behavior adherence . Participants receive positive psychology ( PP ) manual , complete exercise ( e.g. , write gratitude letter , perform act kindness ) , review activity phone study trainer 12-week study period . Specific Aim # 1 ( Feasibility acceptability ( immediate impact ) ; primary aim ) : To assess whether PP exercise administer phone feasible link immediate benefit patient T2D , measure rating provide pre- post- exercise . Hypothesis : The PP exercise feasible ( i.e. , 4 7 PP exercise complete majority participant , participant mean score least 7 10 rating ease completion exercise . The PP exercise also adequate immediate impact ( i.e. , mean rating 7/10 exercise utility post-exercise rating optimism post-exercise significantly high pre-exercise ) . Specific Aim # 2 ( Changes clinical outcome measure ) : To determine whether PP intervention link improvement psychological well-being , intervention period ( 6 &amp; 12 week ) , via measure optimism , gratitude , depression , anxiety . To examine whether brief PP intervention associate improvement self-reported outcome relate health ( diabetes self-care , diabetes distress , health relate quality life ) , intervention . Hypothesis : Participants higher mean score psychological outcome measure 6 12 week compare baseline . Participants also high mean score health-related outcome measure 6 12 week compare baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot feasibility study adult inpatient outpatient MGH . Participants Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) require report suboptimal adherence health behavior , measure Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale ( MOS SAS ) . All participant receive 12-week PP intervention pre- post-intervention assessment mood physical symptom . Participants enrol outpatient Diabetes Center inpatient medical unit MGH ; research staff introduce study , assess inclusion exclusion criterion , obtain write informed consent . Post-enrollment , prior initiation intervention , participant complete baseline self-report measure clinical outcome . During initial enrollment visit , participant receive treatment manual . In person telephone , study interventionist review introductory portion manual discus first exercise ( Gratitude Positive Events ) participant . In subsequent week , exercise complete independently participant , record treatment manual , discuss phone trainer . In final week , final exercise review , interventionist participant discus future implementation way incorporate principle daily life . The 12-week intervention consist 7 distinct PP exercise , complete weekly first 4 week biweekly next 8 week . For feasibility , interventionists record rate exercise completion participant phone session . For acceptability , participant rate optimism positive affect 0-10 scale prior complete exercise immediately follow exercise . Additionally , participant also rate ease overall utility exercise 0-10 scale exercise . At baseline , 6 week , 12 week , non-interventionist study staff obtain follow validated measure study outcome : - Optimism = Life Orientation Test-Revised ( LOT-R ) - Gratitude = Gratitude Questionnaire-6 ( GQ-6 ) - Anxiety depression = Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) - Diabetes-related distress = Diabetes Distress Scale ( DDS ) - Health-related quality life function = Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function scale ( PROMIS-PF-10 ) - Diabetes self-care behavior = Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure ( SDSCA ) - Health behavior adherence = Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale ( MOS SAS )</detailed_description>
