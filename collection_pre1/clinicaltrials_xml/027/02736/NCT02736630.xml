	<brief_summary>Primary objective study project incidence rate perioperative hypothermia general anesthesia patient go minimum 1 hour long elective surgery least 25 hospitals/medical center Turkey . Secondary objective determine patient risk factor associate perioperative hypothermia , determine surgery risk factor associate perioperative hypothermia , determine risk factor associate perioperative hypothermia , intraoperative infusion volume effect warming , intraoperative irrigation volume effect warming , intraoperative blood infusion volume effect warming , determine complication relate perioperative hypothermia , improve patient temperature management awareness process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence Perioperative Hypothermia Patients With Elective Surgery Under General Anesthesia Turkey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild hypothermia perioperative period common , percentage account half patient undergoing operation , directly relate follow three major adverse event significantly increase risk : 1 ) cardiac complication , 2 ) hemorrhage , 3 ) infection complication , particularly patient high risk factor ( ASA grade III , IV ) . Furthermore , decrease body temperature may also lead follow situation : 1 ) prolongation retention time post-anesthetic ICU ( PACU ) , 2 ) decrease thermal comfort patient , thus affect satisfaction degree patient increase cost . From viewpoint patient safety , body surface temperature vital sign . Therefore , order prevent hypothermia perioperative period , core temperature monitoring must carry begin operation . The heat loss operation minimize . Active warming measurement take high risk patient entire procedure operation . Although literature report high incidence rate hypothermia perioperative period selective operation , 's detailed information perioperative hypothermia prevalence Turkey . Actually study patient warm effectiveness . A small scale study do Kocaeli University Turkey 2013 show post operative hypothermia incidence 45.7 % . Another study survey do Cerrahpasa Medicine Faculty show even among healthcare professional great variance perception result hypothermia . Those fact drive investigator gather clinical evidence perioperative hypothermia . Under supervision Turkish Anesthesiology Reanimation Society coordination Prof Dr Hulya Bilgin Uludag University Medicine Faculty Anesthesiology Reanimation Clinic aim gather evidence hypothermia prevalence patient go minimum 1 hour elective surgery general anesthesia . So result study aim improve standard protocol regard patient temperature management , patient warm management also avoid complication cost related hypothermia . In order obtain information current status temperature monitor perioperative warm practice part country , project incidence rate perioperative hypothermia part country , explore relationship perioperative hypothermia postoperative clinical outcome , provide evidence improvement perioperative body temperature management guideline accordance characteristic current Turkish healthcare status , investigator conduct survey department anesthesiology certain region Turkey carry large scale prospective study . In study , investigator search incidence rate perioperative hypothermia survey area , explore cause hypothermia , base expect enable project perioperative hypothermia incidence rate , verify effectiveness perioperative hypothermia risk assessment questionnaire patient general anesthesia , provide guidance evidence clinical practice perioperative warm care .</detailed_description>
