	<detailed_description>In study , aim evaluate independent risk factor osteomyelitis , amputation major amputation diabetic foot infection forward direction without use standard scoring procedure . Patients apply Diabetic Foot Council set diabetic foot infection 2012 2014 include study . Patients follow prospectively ethical approval obtain research ethic committee set . An informed consent form provide patient . Diabetic foot infection decide local infection involve skin subcutaneous tissue infection involve symptom sign criterion . Properties variables case record admission process total 57 different situation . The related characteristic follow end treatment . Osteomyelitis , amputation factor affect major amputation case investigate . In first step , data normality test perform simple data analysis univariate analysis apply second stage meaningful . At last stage , major amputation , amputation osteomyelitis analyze stepwise multiple logistic analysis ( SLA ) model . Logistic regression subject significant data save independent risk factor . The Odds ratio 95 % CI calculate beta coefficient variables significant p value . P &lt; 0.05 used significance test .</detailed_description>
