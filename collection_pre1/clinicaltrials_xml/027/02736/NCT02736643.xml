	<detailed_description>Lung cancer one leading cause cancer-related death Taiwan . Early diagnosis lung cancer may improve cancer survival . Low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT ) think best screen tool lung cancer . However , grow concern radiation exposure , high cost , high rate false-positive screening result . Epidemiology data LDCT screen Taiwan lack . National Taiwan University Hospital Chu-Tung Branch ( NTUHCT ) initiate lung cancer screen LDCT since June 2015 . Many people get LDCT screen affordable price subsidy enterprise donation . The purpose study establish local epidemiological result via telephone follow-up patient ' medical record retrospectively . Aim : To establish local epidemiological data lung pathology , emphysema , bronchiectasis lung disease . Methods : Since June 2015 , 6000 LDCT do NTUHCT . Roughly 6 month test telephone follow-ups patient satisfaction , self-awareness CT result , medical consultation related behavior , willingness come back another test routinely do . Retrospective secondary data analysis perform telephone follow-up result establish local epidemiology data lung pathology well information screen accuracy LDCT . Customers also query willingness provide medical record , linkage National Health Insurance Database inform consent provide advanced information long-term outcome . Keywords : Lung cancer , Low dose compute tomography , screen .</detailed_description>
