	<detailed_description>At present , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) widely use along test help diagnose dementia , however diagnosis still remain challenge . There currently focus usefulness rest state functionalMRI ( RS fMRI ) way establish difference functional connectivity healthy subject various neurodegenerative disorder . Although potential RS fMRI use biomarker neurological disease look promising , research need , especially regard validation normal value seed-based functional connectivity . Further research area help improve ability appropriately classify new subject ultimately allow use RS functional connectivity biomarker . This nontreatment , prospective , natural history data collection aim analyse functional connectivity cohort patient suspect cognitive impairment . Correlation global cognition episodic memory performance rest state fMRI functional connectivity evaluate . Patient population include patient age 18 cognitive impairment age gender match control . Eligible patient complete neuropsychological clinical assessment complete fMRI scan prior enrolment.Study duration estimate 4 year .</detailed_description>
