	<brief_summary>Back pain common secondary condition acute chronic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Current exist treatment include pharmacologic non-pharmacologic limited marginal efficacy intolerable side effect . The purpose study evaluate potential subcutaneous injection botulinum toxin A provide pain relief spinal cord injury patient back pain near level injury spine . Botulinum toxin A show pre-clinical clinical study help nerve pain . The researcher propose double blind placebo control crossover study study effect subcutaneous botulinum injection -- level SCI back pain patient spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , 2 procedure perform . The first procedure name P1 consist subcutaneous injection either placebo Botulinum Toxin A . The second procedure cross-over procedure name P2 . For cross-over procedure , subject initially receive Botulinum Toxin A receive placebo subject initially receive placebo receive Botulinum Toxin A . This Randomized Double-Blinded Placebo Controlled Trial . Recruited subject consent , enrol evaluate immediately prior P1 ( visit prior visit P1 ) . After initial pre-treatment evaluation , subject randomly receive either placebo Botulinum Toxin A subcutaneously ( P1 ) . A telephone follow-up ( e-mail follow ) perform 2 week 8 week post- P1 . An onsite follow perform 4 week post P1 12 week post P1 . Cross-over Study : After 3rd month on-site evaluation ( 12 week post P1 ) , visit , subject proceed cross-over study . At time , patient option receive repeat subcutaneous injection cross-over agent . If desire one , subcutaneous injection cross-over agent perform visit . If wish defer repeat injection , contact ask every 4 week - 12 week 24 week post P1 ( subject receive P2 week 24 ) would like subcutaneous injection cross-over agent . If desire one , repeat injection schedule follow week . The rationale variable length time initial Botulinum Toxin A/Placebo injection ( P1 ) document variability individual ' pain response Botulinum Toxin A . It report literature , subject respond subcutaneous Botulinum Toxin A injection pain , return base-line pain score 12 -- 24 week .</detailed_description>
