	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION Gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , define presence symptom lesion attribute reflux gastric content esophagus , increasingly prevalent condition Western society . The typical symptom heartburn regurgitation , GERD manifest variety esophageal extra-esophageal symptom ( e.g . chronic cough ) . In human , pain multimodal experience compost sensory , physiological psychological aspect . In order mimic clinical situation , experimental model base test regimen different receptor central nervous system mechanism activate . Advances esophageal sensory stimulation establish typical atypical symptom may arise acid reflux , also reflux event less acidic pH ( pH 4-7 ) . In GERD patient symptom persist spite acid suppressive therapy , ongoing weakly-acidic non-acid reflux well establish main underlying factor . The basis symptom generation weakly-acidic reflux event remain determined , acid sensitivity pH range 4-7 , mechanical distention ( enhanced air refluxate ) , sensitivity chemical factor ( e.g . bile ) esophageal hypersensitivity physiological level reflux propose . The investigator speculate visceral hypersensitivity play important role symptom perception . This suggest reflux parameter usual within physiological number proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy . Also , group previously demonstrate refractory GERD patient increase visceral hypersensitivity thermal , chemical mechanical esophageal stimulation compare healthy volunteer . Stress well know affect visceral sensitivity gastrointestinal function general . A majority patient GERD report stress important factor trigger symptom exacerbation . A real-life stressor could exacerbate heartburn symptom GERD patient enhance perceptual response esophageal acid exposure . In Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) patient , visceral hypersensitivity major pathophysiological mechanism stress show trigger exacerbate symptom . A possible mechanism stress−induced visceral sensitivity could barrier dysfunction . Indeed , study perform group , human , acute psychological stressor induces hyperpermeability mast cell dependent fashion exogenous peripheral corticotrophin-releasing hormone recapitulate effect barrier function . This increase intestinal permeability phenomenon appear prerequisite visceral hypersensitivity . Furthermore , study indicate human intestinal motility probably modulate CRH . It show brain-gut axis IBS patient exaggerated response CRH.To knowledge , acute effect exogenous CRH esophageal motility study . 2 . RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES CRH consider prominent mediator stress responses brain-gut axis . In particular , stress-related activation CRH receptor report produce alteration gastrointestinal function . In first study , investigator study effect CRH esophageal sensitivity healthy volunteer ( HV ) . Preliminary result demonstrate CRH-administration increase esophageal sensitivity ( pain perception threshold ) mechanical stimulation esophagus . In present study investigator want study whether exogenous CRH change response mechanical stimulation effect esophageal contractility . Therefore , aim study investigate effect CRH-administration esophageal motility standard high resolution manometry ( HRM ) HV . 3 . GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This study perform 15 HV , sufficient data compare volunteer mutual able make conclusion . All participant sign copy inform consent , attach appendix , initiation study . Esophageal motility measure standard HRM administration CRH . Inclusion criterion include age 18 60 year old history gastrointestinal symptom complaint . Exclusion criterion include history allergic reaction CRH , atopy ( eczema , asthma , food allergy , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis ) multiple allergy several drug , pregnancy lactation , concomitant administration monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) , verapamil diltiazem medication affect esophageal motility , significant co-morbidities ( neuromuscular , psychiatric , cardiovascular , pulmonary , endocrine , autoimmune , renal hepatic ) , prior history esophageal , Ear Nose Throat ( ENT ) gastric surgery endoscopic anti-reflux procedure , history gastrointestinal disease first degree relative Crohn 's disease celiac disease . During last two week study , HV free medication , except oral contraceptive . Each subject willing participate study submit physical examination . Medical history take use medication inquire . 4 . MATERIALS AND METHODS High Resolution Manometry Esophageal body pressure , peristalsis pressure low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) upper part stomach measure use HRM , routinely perform university hospital Gasthuisberg patient symptoms dysphagia . HRM consist measure multiple pressure simultaneously allow detailed assessment relevant data entire esophagus . CRH administration The effect CRH-administration esophageal motility study . After position HRM probe investigator first study esophageal motility baseline condition . After baseline procedure , 100µg CRH powder injection ( CRH ferring® , Ferring , Aalst , Belgium ) dissolve 1 mL sodium chloride ( NaCl ) 0.9 % , solution inject intravenously course 1 minute . With dose , side-effects limit transient facial flushing last 5 45 minute 75 % patient . CRH clinically use diagnostic tool locate source hypercortisolism Cushing 's disease . After 20 minute , esophageal peristalsis study . Saliva Samples Salivary sample obtain HRM procedure use determine salivary cortisol baseline condition , immediately CRH-administration , 30 minute 60 minute administration . Salivary cortisol determine ELISA ( DRG Diagnostics , Marburg , Germany ) accord manufacturer 's instruction . Assessment emotional state An assessment general mood perform Profile Mood Schedule ( POMS ) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI state ) questionnaires esophageal manometry . The POMS consist 32 pair word describe different feeling emotion present moment . The STAI state validate , widely use questionnaire measure transitory anxiety state . The scale consist 20 item , answer 4-point scale . Scores express total sum score . PROTOCOL After overnight fast volunteer come endoscopy unit UZ Gasthuisberg , study perform . At begin study , solid-state manometric catheter consist 36 manometry channel 1cm interval 16 impedance channel ( Medical Measurement Systems , Enschede , The Netherlands ) place transnasally topical anesthesia position along esophagus . Manometry measure pressure esophageal body , LES upper part stomach . The impedance channel use measure bolus movement . After catheter position esophagus volunteer remain bed , semi-recumbent position entire study period . HRM impedance record approximately 2 hour . Primarily , baseline recording obtain . Test boluses 5 mL liquid , 5 mL semisolid , 2 cm2 solid administer orally . During every swallow , volunteer ask complete 5-point scale monitor sensation bolus hold 1 = normal passage , 2 = slow passage , 3 = step-by-step passage , 4 = partial blockage , 5 = complete blockage . After manometry baseline condition , CRH administer IV wait period 20 minute take account since previous protocol CRH administration show 20 30 minute CRH injection , salivary cortisol level high . After wait period repeat procedure use baseline condition .</detailed_description>
