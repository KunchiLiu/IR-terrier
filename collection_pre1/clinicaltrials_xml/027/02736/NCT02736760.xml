	<brief_summary>This study multicenter study investigate clinical efficacy repetitive daylight-PDT MAL ( Methylaminolevulinate ) compare cryosurgery regard prophylaxis treatment AKs ( actinic keratoses ) face . Patients randomly allocate treatment group . 5 PDT ( photodynamic therapy ) treatment session ( visit 1-5 ) perform within 18 month . In control group , cryosurgery perform visit 1 , case non-cleared newly occur AKs visit 2-5 . In PDT group patient apply chemical sunscreen ( SPF 50+ ) whole face light-exposed , unprotected area skin . After least 15 minute lesion preparation AKs ( removal crust ) perform MAL apply thin layer whole face . Within 30 min MAL application patient expose daylight 2 hour . In control group , cryosurgery perform use liquid nitrogen spray AK lesion ; do visit 1 , necessary , also visit 2-5 . At visit 2-6 , efficacy treatment evaluate observer document exist newly appear AKs face .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multicenter study investigate clinical efficacy repetitive daylight-PDT MAL compare cryosurgery regard prophylaxis treatment AKs face . Patients randomly allocate treatment group . 5 PDT treatment session ( visit 1-5 ) perform within 18 month . In control group , cryosurgery perform visit 1 , case non-cleared newly occur AKs visit 2-5 . Before application photosensitizer , organic sunscreen ( Actinica® lotion , LSF 50+ ) without mineral filter apply In entire face . After absorption time approximately 15 minute apply MAL ( Metvix® ) , surface AK lesion prepare gently curette scalpel remove scale crust roughen surface AK-lesions . This facilitate penetration cream light AK lesion . After lesion preparation , MAL ( Metvix® ) uniformly apply whole face thin layer . Within 30 min MAL application patient go outside expose 2 hour daylight . Daylight-PDT perform March October , non-rainy weather outdoor temperature least 10° Celsius . Daylight exposure must start least 3 hour sunset . At end exposure , residual photosensitizer wash patient spend rest day indoors . Cryosurgery AK lesion investigate standard reference therapy . Single freeze-thaw cryosurgery perform use open spray procedure liquid nitrogen nozzle size C. After formation ice-ball require size , freeze time start . Freeze time lie 5 10 .</detailed_description>
