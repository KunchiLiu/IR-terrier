	<brief_summary>Hyperpolarised gas Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( Hyperpolorised 3He 129Xe MRI ) provide novel regional functional image lung . Over past 14 year researcher Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust University Sheffield develop evaluate different MRI technique investigate different aspect lung function Hyperpolorised 3He recently 129Xe gas test new method volunteer healthy diseased lung . This propose study test sensitivity MRI pulse sequence inhale 129Xe gas volunteer . This protocol serve evaluate sensitivity pulse sequence 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging lung monitor transient change vital sign follow gas inhalation . This include evaluation pulse sequence image xenon heart brain well lungs volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment New Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Pulse Sequences Imaging Hyperpolarised Xenon Lung , Heart Brain Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint test pulse sequence development image lung ventilation perfusion , cardiac perfusion brain uptake xenon The study seek test give pulse sequence investigation group 40 volunteer . To eligible , subject contraindication MRI scan sign necessary volunteer consent form . The target recruitment number provide sufficient data determine efficacy technique development . Methods HP 129Xe MRI scan perform . MRI image acquire patient supine inside 129Xe-capable MRI system , ( 1.5 Tesla GE , USA 3.0 Tesla Philips , Netherlands ) , use dedicate transmit-receive radio-frequency coil . 129Xe hyperpolarised site &gt; 50 % polarisation use Rubidium spin exchange polariser , administer Tedlar bag . The 129Xe polarisation process regulatory approval IMP lung image MHRA ( UK-MAIMP-29724 ) . 129Xe manufacture require study volunteer . Manufactured 129Xe held bag prior administration study participant . Bags manufacture gas label use label approve MHRA . Drug accountability record hold site file document administration 129Xe study participant . Hyperpolarised 129Xe prescribed participant prior administration medically qualify study investigator use study-specific prescription . Subjects ask go several test run inhalation procedure prior image without actually start inhale content administration bag . The subject 's heart rate oxygen saturation monitor continuously study use magnetic resonance compatible monitoring equipment .</detailed_description>
