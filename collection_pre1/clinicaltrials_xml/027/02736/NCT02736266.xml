	<brief_summary>Patients T2-T4a N0 urothelial bladder carcinoma ( UBC ) residual disease transurethral resection bladder ( TURB , surgical opinion , cystoscopy radiological presence ) receive 3 cycle pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) dose 200mg 3 weekly prior surgery ( radical cystectomy ) . Cystectomy plan do within 3 week last dose ( account total 9 week ) . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) /CT scan do screening surgery . After cystectomy , patient evidence pathologic stage T3-4 ( pT3-4 ) and/or pathologically node-positive disease manage accord local guideline . Further anti programmed-death ( PD ) -1 anti PD-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) therapy give post-operatively . PD-L1 status centralize assess TURB specimen use anti-PD-L1 antibody ( Ab ) prototype immunohistochemical ( IHC ) assay . PD-L1 positivity define stain stroma ≥1 % tumor cell . Pathologic complete response ( pCR ) primary endpoint . All patient enrol receive least 1 cycle study drug include intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis . The alternative hypothesis ( H1 ) pCR ≥20 % null hypothesis ( H0 ) pCR≤10 % . A 2-stage design use estimate number pt require . Out 90 pt overall , first stage 49 pt , ≥6 pCR require first stage , ≥13 pCR whole study population ( 80 % power 2-sided test significance 10 % level ) . Correlative research tissue/blood sample include immune-cell profiling tumor blood Pembrolizumab , cytokine assessment , molecular profile tumor sample .</brief_summary>
