	<brief_title>Registry Trial Determine pCLE Image Interpretation Criteria Preliminary Accuracy PSC Biliary Strictures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>pCLE ( probe base confocal laser endomicroscopy ) innovative technology , provide real- time , microscopic image tissue cellular level via small diameter probe . The pCLE probe design fit standard endoscope study extensively gastrointestinal tract real time diagnosis condition Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) , biliary stricture endoscopic mucosal resection colorectal lesion . Over 300 publication document safety efficacy pCLE GI tract . Ductal pathology presently diagnose , characterize sometimes treated Endoscopic Retrograde CholangioPancreatography ( ERCP ) catheter advance endoscope insert biliary pancreatic duct , contrast agent inject X-rays take . But multiple tissue sampling ( biopsy brush ) require considerable time technical expertise risk lose guide wire access across biliary pancreatic stricture . Tissue sample technique show lead highly specific result diagnose malignant tumor ( 100 % ) , low sensitivity ( 45- 75 % ) . Furthermore , pancreatitis one common serious complication ERCP , occur 5-7 % case . The CholangioFlex confocal miniprobe specifically design explore bile pancreatic duct ( diameter range 0.9 2.5mm ) . Intended used via ERCP procedure , pass operating channel cholangioscope insert standard catheter . Dr. Meining examine small series 14 patient biliary stricture Mucosal image perform miniaturized confocal miniprobe introduce via work channel cholangioscope . Thereafter , target biopsy take region . All stricture could reach , lead pCLE accuracy 86 % , sensitivity 83 % , specificity 88 % . The respective number standard histopathology 79 % , 50 % , 100 % . Dr. Giovannini evaluate diagnostic accuracy pCLE cholangiocarcinoma detection , 37 patient biliary pancreatic stricture . The CholangioFlex confocal miniprobe introduce bile pancreatic duct use catheter , strictures image . Tissue sample perform location . In study , overall pCLE accuracy 86 % ( vs. 53 % histology ) , sensitivity specificity pCLE 83 % 75 % respectively compare 65 % 53 % histology . An observational prospective , `` Cellvizio ERCP registry '' , conduct enrolled 102 patient indeterminate suspect biliary and/or pancreatic stricture , mass neoplasm indicate ERCP and/or cholangioscopy . The purpose multicentric trial compare combination Cellvizio ERCP image ERCP alone , use Miami Classification ( set image interpretation criterion develop differentiate benign malignant stricture ) . Physicians could choose whether deliver CholangioFlex confocal miniprobe cholangioscope catheter . Patients follow physician able confirm malignancy histopathology year repeat tissue sample lead benign result . There pCLE-related adverse event study 89 patient finally evaluable , 40 proven cancer . The sensitivity , specificity , positive-predictive value , negative- predictive value pCLE detect cancerous stricture 98 % , 67 % , 71 % , 97 % , respectively , compare 45 % , 100 % , 100 % , 69 % index pathology . This result overall accuracy 81 % pCLE compare 75 % index pathology . Accuracy combination ERCP pCLE significantly high compare ERCP tissue acquisition ( 90 % vs. 73 % ; P .001 ) . Due relatively low specificity , group investigator review false positive case registry new criterion characterize inflammatory stricture , know present pCLE feature similar malignant stricture . 60 pCLE along final diagnosis review 3 pCLE-experienced gastroenterologist refine already exist Miami classification devise novel pCLE criterion characterization inflammatory stricture . The 4 criterion devise diagnose dysplasia BE : 1 ) Multiple thin white band , 2 ) Dark granular pattern scale , increase space scale , thicken reticular structure . These criterion review validated consensus 6 pCLE expert use set 40 pCLE sequence . The overall accuracy 82.5 % vs. 81 % prospective registry ( n=98 ) , result sensitivity 81.2 % ( vs. 98 % prospective study ) specificity 83.3 % ( vs. 67 % prospective study ) . The corresponding interobserver agreement fair ( k=0,37 ) . This new criterion currently test prospective multicentric trial , aim evaluate impact pCLE management patient indeterminate biliary stricture . The purpose present pCLE Registry study condition high unmet medical need preliminary differentiate criterion : Primary sclerosing cholangitis . This condition offer challenge diagnostic pathway could benefit direct visualization tissue via minimally invasive ductal approach .</detailed_description>
