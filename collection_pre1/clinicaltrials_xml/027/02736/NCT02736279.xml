	<brief_summary>Objectives : Dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) therapy may cause measureable change bacterial specie gut . The primary objective study : 1 . Determine whether measureable change bacterial specie representation follow institution DMF . 2 . Determine whether specific pattern change microbiota phylotype DMF therapy correlate onset severity gastrointestinal disturbance ( heartburn , nausea , flatulence , diarrhea ) . 3 . Determine whether instability microbiota phylotype representation persist follow institution DMF whether stabilization relate resolution gastrointestinal disturbance . 4 . Determine whether correlation pre-existing functional bowel disorder development severity gastrointestinal disturbance peripheral eosinophilia . Design : Double-blinded , prospective , single-center pilot study . Patient Population : Individuals 18 year old , confirm diagnosis relapse form multiple sclerosis . Treatment Groups : This study open-label prospective study design respect MS immunomodulatory therapy choice . Study group define subject relapse form multiple sclerosis , define McDonald criterion , choose begin DMF therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label prospective study design respect MS immunomodulatory therapy choice . Study group define subject relapse form multiple sclerosis define McDonald criterion choose begin dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) therapy . Blinding principal investigator study subject microbiota analysis result maintain planned end study . Subjects receive least one dose DMF subsequently discontinue therapy invite complete study alternative immunomodulatory therapy therapy . Data subject receive least one dose DMF withdraw early study include analysis last visit carry forward . A goal set enroll 25 subject study . Gut microbiota characterize use commercial service , Second Genome , utilize bacterial DNA extraction stool sample 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplification , follow high-throughput sequencing . Taxonomic profile Illumina MiSeq system cycle generate pair 250-bp read Second Genome 's protocol . These longer read lengths provide high-quality full length-reads gene ensure accurate classification available sequence technology . Next generation sequence emerge powerful tool investigate microbial community large sample set . Serial stool sample collect subject , sent Second Genome analysis . The first stool sample collect prior initial dose DMF , subsequent collection define time point course study . A intensive analysis focus first 12 week treatment , time development resolution gastrointestinal side effect typically take place therapy . Treatment-emergent flushing severity record time use 5-point Likert scale flush severity survey . Gastrointestinal ( G.I . ) symptom assess use Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale ( GSRS ) questionnaire , validate , self-administered questionnaire include 15 question , assess severity G.I . symptom use 7-point Likert scale five domain : indigestion , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain reflux . The severity symptom report GSRS increase increase score . Other variable potentially may alter gastrointestinal microbiota secondarily DMF tolerance assess , include identification subject predispose functional bowel disorder via use Rome III functional bowel survey , validate clinical tool identify at-risk individual , diet composition , antibiotic exposure , steroid treatment neurological relapse , use prebiotic , probiotic , vitamin D supplement , H2 blocker proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy , gut pH change impact gut flora composition.Additional data mood change 24 week DMF therapy , use Hamilton Anxiety Measurement ( HAM ) Rating Scale Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) Depression Scale , collect correlate DMF-emergent G.I . disturbance , change bacterial archaeal specie gut flora .</detailed_description>
