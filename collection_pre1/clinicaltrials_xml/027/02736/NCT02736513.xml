For patient whose intracranial disease progress , brain radiotherapy ( form SRS WBRT ) administer ; treatment AZD9291 interrupt re-initiated standard dose end radiotherapy course absence symptomatic systemic progression .

	<detailed_description>Patients receive AZD9291 dose 80 mg daily . Intracranial response assess brain MRI scan , systemic evaluation do PET-CT scan . In case isolate CNS progression may may accompany asymptomatic systemic progression , mind blood-brain-barrier possible pharmacokinetic resistance mechanism , AZD9291 dose escalate 160 mg daily . For patient whose intracranial disease progress , brain radiotherapy ( form SRS WBRT ) administer ; treatment AZD9291 interrupt re-initiated standard dose end radiotherapy course absence symptomatic systemic progression . The treatment continue symptomatic systemic progression , unacceptable toxicity intracranial progression follow brain radiotherapy administration ( whichever occurs first ) . All patient follow death 5 year . Intracranial outcome assess modified RECIST criterion ( mRECIST ) analyze . The added value increase dose ( 160 mg ) failure standard dose assess well . Since neurologically asymptomatic patient plan enrol , important use mRECIST criterion allow small brain lesion assess ( accord criterion , ≥ 5mm tumor consider measurable 5 target lesion allow ) 1 . Systemic response assessment do use RECIST 1.1 . Exploratory analysis outcome perform accord treatment setting ( treatment-naïve vs. acquire resistance set ) EGFR mutation subtype . Additionally , serum protein biomarker analysis perform correlation intracranial systemic response . Safety parameter monitor .</detailed_description>
