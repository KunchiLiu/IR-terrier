	<brief_summary>Background Surgery mid low rectal cancer associate relative high rate incomplete mesorectal excision high rate circumferential resection margin ( CRM ) involvement result significant number local recurrence . Moreover , patient mid low rectal cancer suffer high rate morbidity , permanent colostomy impairment quality life . The transanal TME ( TaTME ) develop improve quality TME mid low rectal cancer . Study design The COLOR III trial international multicentre randomise study compare short- long-term outcome TaTME laparoscopic TME rectal cancer . The study include quality assessment phase randomisation ensure require competency level uniformity new TaTME technique laparoscopic TME . During trial clinical data review centrally ensure uniform quality . Endpoints Primary endpoint involvement CRM . Secondary endpoint include morbidity mortality , residual mesorectum ( postoperative MRI ) , local recurrence , disease-free overall survival , percentage sphincter save procedure , functional outcome quality life . Statistics In laparoscopic TME percentage involve CRM estimate 7 % . To detect reduction 3 % two-sided level significance 5 % power 80 % total 1098 patient need . Randomisation 2:1 ratio favour TaTME procedure . It stratify T-stage , preoperative radiotherapy , height tumour , gender BMI . All analyse intention-to-treat basis . Main selection criterion Patients histologically prove single mid low rectum carcinoma ( 0-10cm anal verge ) MRI , eligible TME surgery curative intent , include . Main exclusion criterion T4 tumour , T3 tumours suspect involved mesorectal fascia ( MRF ) neoadjuvant therapy , patient concomitant metastasis malignancy , malignancy medical history sign acute mechanical obstruction tumour . Hypothesis The hypothesis TaTME result well mesorectum specimen quality low rate involve CRM therefore low rate local recurrence . Furthermore , TaTME procedure potentially enable sphincter save procedure positive effect functional outcome health relate quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COLOR III Trial : Transanal v Laparoscopic TME</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To improve oncological functional outcome patient rectal cancer new surgical technique develop . The adoption TME technique result well oncological outcome last decade . The addition neoadjuvant therapy improve oncological outcome . The minimal invasive laparoscopic resection rectal cancer show safe result improve short-term outcome reduce morbidity . Nevertheless , laparoscopic resection mid low rectal cancer remain challenge due anatomy narrow pelvis associate relative high risk resection tumour involve CRM result increase risk recurrence . In attempt improve quality TME procedure low rectal cancer improve oncological result TaTME develop , rectum dissect transanally accord TME principle . First series describe since 2010 although randomise evidence still lack new technique show feasible safe . The rectum include total mesorectum mobilise transanally reversed way minimally invasive surgery include high quality image technique . The TaTME technique mid low rectal cancer show potential benefit : good specimen quality less CRM involvement , less morbidity result avoid extraction wound majority patient sphincter save rectal resection without compromise oncological outcome . The investigator propose evaluate TaTME technique compare conventional laparoscopic rectal resection patient mid low rectal cancer international randomise trial : COLOR III trial .</detailed_description>
