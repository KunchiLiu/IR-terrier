	<detailed_description>In severe bleeding due trauma , fall coagulation factor maintain promotes bleed . The plasma allow , contribution coagulation factor , early prevention correction post-traumatic coagulopathy . This labile blood product far use armed conflict military medical surgical unit deploy External Operations ( EXOP ) meet logistical constraint operate environment need , without delay , therapeutic plasma treat bleed casualty . Unlike frozen plasma use hospital , FLYP store room temperature reconstitute less 6 min . In civilian world , FLYP could use health institution major logistical difficulty allow ensure cold chain sub-zero temperature , extreme emergency situation need immediate therapeutic plasma supply . In second indication , FLYP use fresh frozen plasma thaw available . Its use pre-hospital situation also justify due immediate availability storage condition . FLYP sterile powder-form residual humidity exceed 2 % . It package sterile pyrogenic glass vial . The main objective show effectiveness pre-hospital administer FLYP treatment traumatic hemorrhagic shock , occurrence treatment post traumatic coagulopathy . The secondary objective : - usability administer pre-hospital FLYP - show FLYP improve fibrinogen level - show use FLYP decrease transfusion requirement ( RBC , plasma , coagulation factor , platelet , fibrinogen ) - show use FLYP reduce length stay ICU - compare mortality 2 group day 30 Method The attribution experimental treatment ( FLYP saline ) , patient receive treatment number 1 140 , carry advance use STATA 14.0 software . Type randomisation : randomisation block 2 , stratify center . Treatments allocate participant `` pre-hospital '' center ascend number . Participants investigator therefore blind allocated treatment . However , statistical analysis plan carry blind study regard knowledge allocate treatment . The planned experimental design identical pre-hospital investigation centre . Care patient traumatic hemorrhagic shock identical one investigating centre another : base formalize expert recommendation hemorrhagic shock resuscitation . Determination number subject require An `` versus '' observational study external military operation patient present haemorrhage traumatic origin , report significant improvement level Prothrombin `` '' period ( corresponded FLYP administration - The period correspond Saline infusion without FLYP ) . In total , 124 patient require observe statistically significant difference ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . In absence another publication subject propose include 70 patient per group , allow significant result observational study cite replicate . There plan interim analysis . The administration treatment study stop adverse event ( AE ) occur ( abnormal clinical manifestation , ... ) offend experimental treatment retain . Usual care corrective action continue field , transport receive hospital . An independent oversight committee meet organize discus stop continuation study accord nature AE . Comparability group primary endpoint Regarding primary endpoint : variation prothrombin level initial moment pre-hospital care ( administration FLYP ) time arrival hospital ( FLYP ) , variation compare group receive FLYP v group receive usual treatment ( saline ) analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) adjust delay two sample age . Comparability group secondary endpoint - The usability administer FLYP judge ground interruption non-administration experimental treatment , depend ability respect procedure use Labile Blood Product accord rule good practice . - The average differential ( pre-hospital -hospital ) fibrinogen level two group compare ANCOVA adjust delay two sample age . - Transfusion requirement judge number median amount transfuse arrival hospital : pack red blood cell ( RBC ) , platelet concentrate , fibrinogen , coagulation factor plasma . The transfusion requirement measure period 24 48 hour . - The median number day ICU two group use median test - Survival analysis 30 day base comparison Kaplan-Meier curve , log-rank test , Cox model estimate role administration FLYP survival , take account potential confounding factor . - Regarding secondary endpoint : variation fibrinogen blood level initial moment pre-hospital care ( administration FLYP ) time arrival hospital ( FLYP ) , variation fibrinogen compare group receive FLYP v group receive usual treatment ( saline ) analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) adjust delay two sample age . INTERRUPTION OR STOPPING OF THE STUDY The sponsor responsibility report , national health authority , serious unexpected adverse event attributable labile blood product cell therapy and/or protocol within 15 day ( 7 day case death life-threatening situation ) . In case occurrence incident , accident , event , interruption study plan analysis decision hemovigilance safety committee study . RISKS A full report risk , description incident , accident adverse event subject chapter result section also discussion . FINANCING Funding study provide Health Department Army ( promoter , follow acceptance study context Clinical research project Health service army ) . DISCUSSION The study must confirm link causality early administration plasma improve post-traumatic coagulopathy . The study must show safe usage out-of-hospital situation ability medical staff meet requirement health authority term product use well term traceability victim treatment receive . CONCLUSION This first study aim assess usability benefit FLYP extra hospital use .</detailed_description>
