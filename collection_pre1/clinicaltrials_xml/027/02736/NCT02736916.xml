	<brief_summary>Prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) important treatment modality patient limited stage small cell lung cancer ( LD-SCLC ) . However , PCI also associate several side effect , decline memory cognitive function . This provide rationale explore clinical feasibility hippocampal avoidance WBRT . Previous study demonstrate dosimetric capability IMRT conformally avoid hippocampus without detriment radiation dose remain brain receives . The aim study evaluate therapy efficacy safety profile hippocampal-sparing whole-brain radiation therapy ( HS-WBRT ) PCI patient LD-SCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy plus thoracic radiation follow prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) standard care management limit stage small cell lung cancer patient . However , whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) also associate many side effect include consolidation new memory , poor attention span/concentration , visual spatial difficulty , difficulty executive planning , poor fine motor control . There exist significant preclinical clinical evidence radiation induce injury hippocampus correlate neurocognitive decline patient receive WBRT . Reducing radiation dose hippocampus WBRT postulate approach mitigate neurocognitive impairment . The present study hypothesize hippocampal spar PCI allow improved performance test short term memory executive function compare historical control receive dose conventional PCI . The primary objective study evaluate performance Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delay recall 6 month follow hippocampal-sparing PCI relative historical control . Secondary objective estimate : composite cognitive function follow hippocampal-sparing PCI relative historical control rate metastasis hippocampus 2 year follow hippocampal-sparing PCI .</detailed_description>
