	<brief_title>Treatment Uterine Fibroids With Magnetic Resonance Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine fibroid benign smooth muscle tumour muscular wall uterus affect 40 per cent woman . While majority fibroid asymptomatic , fibroid may cause menorrhagia , bulk symptom ( i.e . ureteric obstruction , urinary frequency urgency , bowel dysfunction ) , pain certain instance infertility . Magnetic resonance image-guided high-intensity focus ultrasound ( MR-HIFU ) treatment fibroid establish method symptom alleviation 3000 woman receive treatment worldwide . MR-HIFU non-invasive , non-surgical procedure use ultrasound energy thermally ablate fibroid lead reduction bleed size uterine fibroid time . MR-HIFU currently use treatment symptomatic fibroid Canada . The Thunder Bay Regional Research Institute one first clinically available MR-HIFU equipment Canada . In order bring technology clinical practice , knowledge translation study need demonstrate MR-HIFU treat symptomatic uterine fibroid successfully Northwestern Ontario compare urban centre clinical trial conduct . The ability screen follow woman treat MR-HIFU ultrasound rather MRI would allow participant receive follow regional centre Northwestern Ontario would cost effective health system perspective . In addition , research need broaden scope treatment include fibroid great 8 cm woman could benefit non-surgical fibroid management option .</detailed_description>
