At end rehabilitation , patient randomize two group 50 patient . Patients first Group allocate home-based telemedicine ( HBT ) , second group receive recommendation continue exercise home ( Control group ) . The HBT intervention consist fortnightly schedule phone call patient 6-month course study . A nurse-tutor encourages patient perform regularly physical activity prescribes exercise .

	<detailed_description>Systematic review conclude exercise teach individually prescribe perform home , effective decrease neck pain avoid recurrence neck pain ( re-exacerbations ) patient adhere home exercise program . Conversely , inadequate adherence home-based exercise program reduce treatment 's efficacy . Telemedicine already employ many field medicine evaluate health status , treatment , education , monitor patient ' care need management patient chronic neck pain . Studies available literature yet clearly define phone surveillance program effective decrease pain patient . Conversely , think telemedicine may useful tool physician management chronic neck pain increase adherence home exercise program thus reduce neck pain disability patient . To verify hypothesis perform prospective randomize control study . The study perform 100 consecutive patient chronic non-specific neck pain refer outpatient facility Rehabilitation Department . Patients &gt; 18 year neck pain duration 6 month . Exclusion criterion : pain duration &lt; 6 month , cognitive deficit , history fracture operation around neck region , presence inflammatory rheumatic disease , neurological disease could lead neck pain , infection tumor , pregnancy , previous rehabilitation neck pain undergone within last 12 month , inability attend exercise session outpatient rehabilitation program . All patient complete , outpatient , exercise program consist 10 session , spread 2-week period ( 5 days/week ) , include six stretching exercise neck . Patients instruct individually physical therapist perform exercise , first rehabilitation session , encourage exercise regularly home . Written illustrate material explain home exercise provide patient . At end outpatient rehabilitation program , patient randomize ( use randomization list provide statistical consultant ) two group 50 patient . Patients first group allocate home-based telemedicine ( HBT ) program 6 month ( HBT group ) , second group receive recommendation continue exercise home ( Control group ) . The HBT intervention consist fortnightly schedule phone call patient 6-month course study . A nurse-tutor collect information : disease status , pain , disability , prodromal symptom exacerbation , number home exercise session perform , use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug . In consultation physiatrist , nurse give advice solution persistent pain symptom exacerbation . The patient always encourage perform regularly physical activity exercise prescribe . The physiatrist involve second-opinion consultant . The patient evaluate entry 6 month end outpatient rehabilitation qualify physiatrist . At entry , scale demonstrate reliability , validity sensitivity administer assess comorbidity ( evaluated Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics ) , pain severity ( 10-point analogue scale ) , neck range motion ( manual goniometer ) , neck disability ( Neck Disability Index ) . Adherence home exercise evaluate 15 day 6 month end outpatient rehabilitation self-reported . Differences adherence home exercise , pain intensity neck disability , baseline 6-month follow , assess compare two group .</detailed_description>
