	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well obinutuzumab work combination ibrutinib treat patient mantle cell lymphoma return ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Obinutuzumab bind protein call cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20 , find B cell type leukemia lymphoma cell help immune system kill cancer cell . Ibrutinib block protein call Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) , may help keep cancer cell grow . Giving obinutuzumab combination ibrutinib may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obinutuzumab Combination With Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Best overall response complete response/partial response ( CR/PR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Toxicity define adverse event ( AE ) grade 3 high . II . Progression free survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Gene expression profile use Lymph5Cx test . II . Sequencing use ion torrent platform ( 76 gene panel know mutation lymphoma ) . III . Sequencing BTK evaluate BTK mutation . IV . Minimal residual disease test ( MRD flow cytometry target sequence post treatment ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 ( course 1 ) day 1 ( course 2-6 ) . Patients also receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) begin day 1 ( course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve partial response ( PR ) continue receive obinutuzumab IV every 2 month ibrutinib PO QD 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
