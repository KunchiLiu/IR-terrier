	<brief_summary>Recently clinical guideline categorize pneumonia three type : community , healthcare-associated , hospital-acquired . Much exist research describe epidemiology pneumonia critically ill patient come single-center study retrospective database analysis , limit generalizability lead over-prescription broad-spectrum antibacterial agent . This prospective , multicenter epidemiological study characterize pneumonia epidemiology critically ill adult patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pneumonia one lead cause death United States associate significant cost healthcare system . Recent treatment guideline describe new subtype pneumonia , healthcare-associated pneumonia ( HCAP ) , identify patient present hospital community think great risk develop pneumonia due multidrug resistant organism ( MDRO ) . The HCAP categorization scheme intend improve prescription initial appropriate empiric antibacterial agent minimize morbidity mortality associate inappropriate empiric selection.However , one chief criticism guideline recommendation criterion use define HCAP overly broad , may result great use broad-spectrum antibiotic . The prevailing notion many patient community low risk experience MDR pneumonia treat less broad anti-infective regimen . Patients increase exposure healthcare system receive initial anti-infective therapy broad effort target MDROs . The investigator group believe simply exposure healthcare system predict incidence MDR pneumonia ( i.e. , criterion HCAP ) , rather , `` intensity '' exposure healthcare system predictive MDR pneumonia . The aim study identify risk factor MDR HCAP pneumonia critically ill patient . .</detailed_description>
