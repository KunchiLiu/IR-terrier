	<brief_summary>The study aim compare efficacy safety S-1 6 month versus S-1 1 year adjuvant chemotherapy D2 resection patient gastric cancer . Hypothesis : For gastric patient D2 resection , S-1 6 month show non-inferiority S-1 1 year disease free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare S-1 6 Months 1 Year Adjuvant Chemotherapy After D2 Resection Patients With Gastric Cancer Staged II , IIIA IIIB .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It identify S-1 effective adjuvant treatment East Asian patient undergone D2 dissection locally advance gastric cancer（GC ) Japanese Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial TS-1（S-1 ) Gastric Cancer ( ACTS-GC ) trail , And S-1 become one standard therapies patient . But still unknown whether would improve equally even overall survival ( OS ) disease free survival ( DFS ) S-1 1 year compare S-1 6 month . As result , An clinical trail still need , This trial design investigate efficacy safety S-1 6 month versus S-1 1 year adjuvant chemotherapy D2 resection patient gastric cancer . In study , patient histologically confirm stage II , IIIA IIIB receive D2 resection randomly assign receive S-1 6 month S-1 1 year . Patients age 18 75 year adequate organ function , randomize 1:1 S-1 6 month S-1 1 year . Both 3-week recycle S-1 ( 80-120mg per day ) 2 week , follow 1 week rest . The primary end point 3-year DFS , secondary end point 5-year OS safety . Final study analysis conduct end 5th year last patient 's enrollment.In summary , hold hypothesis S-1 6 month equally effective , safe , easy carry . If possible , new adjuvant chemotherapy strategy gastric cancer patient D2 resection . To ensure quality study , two interim analysis plan half completion study respectively . The DATA Safety Monitoring Committee independently review interim analysis stop study ahead schedule necessary . Furthermore , improve study progress quality , in-house interim monitoring perform .</detailed_description>
