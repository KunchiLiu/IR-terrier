	<brief_summary>This study plan test pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate combination biotherapy regimen consist nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone patient advance operable melanoma . Evaluation presence tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cell well PDL1 expression IDO expression associate clinical response ( pathologic and/or radiologic ) . The study test radiologic/clinical preoperative response rate , recurrence free survival ( RFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . It evaluate safety neoadjuvant nivolumab neoadjuvant nivolumab-ipilimumab . Up 66 patient randomize 1:1 ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Combination Biotherapy With Ipilimumab Nivolumab Nivolumab Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study 2 study arm : - Nivolumab alone ( Arm A ) - Induction phase : nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV infusion every 2 week x3 dos . Followed Definitive Surgery . - Maintenance phase : nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV infusion every 3 week one year study treatment initiation . - Ipilimumab + nivolumab ( Arm B ) - Induction phase : Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg IV + Nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV every 3 week x2 . Followed Definitive Surgery . - Maintenance phase : nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV infusion every 2 week one year study treatment initiation . Definitive Surgery consist complete lymph node dissection/ lymphatic , cutaneous , subcutaneous distant disease resection ( week 6-8+ ) .</detailed_description>

Clinically detected recurrence melanoma proximal regional lymph node ( ) basin . Clinically detected primary melanoma involve multiple regional nodal group . Clinically detected site nodal metastatic melanoma arise unknown primary . Patients intransit satellite metastasis without lymph node involvement allow consider surgically resectable baseline . Patients distant metastasis without intransit lymph node involvement allow consider potentially surgically resectable baseline . NOTE : All patient must determine surgically resectable baseline eligible neoadjuvant study . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . Have provide tumor tissue newly obtain core , punch , incisional excisional tumor biopsy . Patients must undergo biopsy ( core , punch ) open incisional/excisional biopsy ( do part clinically indicated baseline diagnostic procedure ) within 4 week registration study . Patients must evaluate standardofcare full body image study ( CT , PET/CT MRI ) part initial clinical workup baseline ( 4 week prior study enrollment ) completion induction nivolumabipilimumab nivolumab alone ( 68 week first dose induction prior definitive surgery procedure ) . Required value initial laboratory test : White blood cell ( WBC ) 3000/uL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1500/uL Platelets 100 x 103/uL Hemoglobin 10 g/dL Aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase ( AST/ALT ) 2.5 x unique learner number ( ULN ) Bilirubin 1.5 ULN , ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) : Female CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Male CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL • No active chronic infection HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C Subject exclude participate trial meet follow criterion : Patients exclude history central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis . Patients history acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , GI obstruction abdominal carcinomatosis know risk factor bowel perforation . Any malignancy patient diseasefree less 3 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer carcinoma situ cervix . Patients exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease exclude study , patient history symptomatic autoimmune disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis ( scleroderma ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g . GuillainBarre Syndrome ) . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger . Has evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Patients exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . As potential hepatic toxicity nivolumab nivolumab/ipilimumab combination , drug predisposition hepatoxicity use caution patient treat nivolumabcontaining regimen .
