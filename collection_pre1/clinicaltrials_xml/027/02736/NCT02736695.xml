	<brief_title>Assessment Hyperphosphorylated Tau PET Binding Primary Progressive Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary progressive aphasia ( PPA ) umbrella term encompasses group neurodegenerative syndrome characterize vary combination progressive speech language problem . Three clinical variant PPA describe well recognize : agrammatic variant characterize grammatical error speech write typically associate phonetic error speech ; semantic variant characterize poor naming loss knowledge meaning word ; logopenic variant characterize word retrieval problem poor sentence repetition impairment work memory phonemic error . Pathological study PPA patient die postmortem examination brain demonstrate PPA associate number different abnormal cellular protein perfect association three PPA variant . One protein microtubule associate protein , tau , common abnormal protein find brain patient PPA . Tau important protein link neurodegenerative process many disease . No neuroimaging study investigate tau deposition PPA hence bind characteristic AV-1451 ( Tau bind drug use study ) PPA unknown . Understanding bind characteristic AV-1451 crucial help determine whether serve biomarker tau deposition brain patient PPA .</detailed_description>
