Work burnout defined syndrome dysfunction three domain , emotional exhaustion , depersonalization , reduce sense personal accomplishment . ( Maslach et . al. , 1981 ) . Often , burnout associate poor sleep quality negative affectivity , depression anxiety . In fact , preliminary data demonstrate burnout medical resident affect sleep quality , increase negative emotion . Strikingly , burnout medical resident negatively impact work performance well patient-physician interaction , hence may affect quality health care . However , lack study aim understating work burnout affect cognitive performance decision make medical resident . The propose study provide essential groundwork demonstrate link burnout impaired cognitive performance . In addition , propose study demonstrate feasibility future trial test whether intervention , emWave , integrate computer base stress management ( resilience training ) , positive impact resident high burnout symptom . The amelioration psychological risk factor medical resident may lead improve physician-patient relationship service improve quality care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Burnout residency year , particular training obtain medical specialty , well recognize . Often , burnout associate poor sleep quality negative affectivity , depression . However , aspect positive emotion link improved physical mental health , trait forgiveness ( TF ) , poorly explore . For instance , accord statistic , depression resident high twenty-five percent , resident ' suffer depression resident burnout ( define occupational related syndrome emotional exhaustion low sense professional accomplishment ) high seventy-six percent . In fact , first-year resident , sense high well-being , experience great level burnout depression end first year . ( www.aafp.org , Yi M.S . et al . , 2007 ; Shanafelt T.D . et al . ,2002 ; Richman J.A . et . al . , 1992 ) There two specific aim collaborator I focus two-phase study : Specific Aim 1 : To explore impact work burnout cognitive performance psychological functioning medical resident . Mounting evidence point towards conclusion work burnout negative effect psychological functioning medical resident . We test work hypothesis work burnout associate poor cognitive performance , poor sleep quality , high negative affectivity . Our approach use self-reported cognitive impairment cognitive performance task design measure three basic process underlie executive control : ( ) updating , ( ii ) inhibition , ( iii ) switching . Negative affective symptom measure use validate psychometric scale depression ( Beck Depressive Inventory ; BDI ) , anxiety ( State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ; STAI ) , anger ( State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 ; STAEI-2 ) . Sleep quality assess via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) . Specific Aim 2 - To examine impact 8-week computer base resilience train intervention work burnout , cognitive performance , affectivity medical resident . Our approach test impact intervention SmartPhone ( e.g Android Phone Iphone ) application , emWave software , provide subject . emWave tool reduces stress allow individual less reactive , think clearly , make good decision , especially pressure . Fifty medical resident high burnout symptom randomize receive 8-week intervention ( INT ; n=25 ) sham control ( CON ; n=25 ) .</detailed_description>
