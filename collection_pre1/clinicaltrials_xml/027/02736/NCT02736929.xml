	<brief_title>The Effect Reducing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There fundamental gap understanding diagnosis post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) portend excess risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . This primarily two reason : ( 1 ) core study provide support association PTSD CHD risk depend lengthy follow-up period repeat measurement either PTSD relate cardiovascular risk factor ; ( 2 ) PTSD highly comorbid adverse health behavior psychiatric comorbidity also vary across time could largely explain association PTSD increase risk CHD . The long-term goal well understand whether direct link PTSD CHD risk , well ascertain role candidate pathophysiological mechanism . The study propose application design examine change PTSD symptom follow establish therapeutic intervention ( Cognitive Processing Therapy ) affect CHD disease pathways individual PTSD . This design permit evaluation hypothesis individual show significant improvement PTSD symptom also show improvement CHD risk biomarkers , individual fail show improvement show worsen PTSD symptom , show change worsen CHD biomarker activity . The study also provide evaluation role key stress-related CHD biomarkers mechanisms underlie increase CHD risk burden associate PTSD . Choice CHD biomarkers focus establish association PTSD chronic activation stress response system include autonomic nervous system dysregulation , chronic systemic inflammation , vascular endothelial dysfunction . The propose research significant expect provide knowledge role direct impact PTSD symptom CHD risk pathway role system candidate mechanism underlie relationship PTSD CHD risk . By good define PTSD risk factor CHD , well identify disease pathway involve , propose study help inform strategy CHD prevention , well guide optimal medical management vulnerable men woman PTSD , especially refrain refractory psychiatric treatment .</detailed_description>
