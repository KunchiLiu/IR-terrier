	<brief_summary>Regorafenib oral multikinase inhibitor block activity kinases involve angiogenesis ( VEGFR 1,2,3 TEK ) , oncogenesis ( KIT , Ret Proto-Oncogene ( RET ) , Raf-1 Proto-Oncogene , Serine/Threonine Kinase ( RAF1 ) BRAF ) tumour growth ( PDGFR FGFR ) . Epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) cell line frequently express high level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) vivo preclinical study evaluate Regorafenib show promising activity ovarian cancer . In clinic , anti-angiogenesis therapy bevacizumab ( monoclonal antibody VEGF ) already emerge important cornerstone management ovarian cancer part frontline adjuvant treatment second-line therapy platinum-sensitive recurrent disease . Whilst Regorafenib FDA approve treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer fail prior bevacizumab , 's role management ovarian cancer remain define .</brief_summary>
