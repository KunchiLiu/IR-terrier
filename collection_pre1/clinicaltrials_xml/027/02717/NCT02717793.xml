	<brief_summary>1 repetition maximum ( RM ) Maximum Voluntary Contraction ( MVC ) digital dynamometer popular method measure muscle strength . The type muscle contraction involve different , 1RM involves isotonic muscle contraction ( ITMC ) MVC digital dynamometer involve isometric muscle contraction ( IMMC ) . There several risk involve measurement 1RM , delay onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) unsafe pathological joint etc , reduce IMMC use measure strength . Though equated different type contraction , therefore purpose study compare 1RM measurement isometric MVC use digital hand-held dynamometer healthy female . Twenty nine young female ( mean age = 20.77 ± 1.28 ) without weight training experience ( mean BMI = 20.43 ± 1.85 ) volunteer study . It crossover trial 48 hour rest period give measurement technique . The result show moderate correlation ( r = 0.365-0.847 ) 1RM MVC . A simple linear regression analysis reveal significant estimate regression equation dominant non-dominant hand . [ Dominant , Y=0.391x + 1.472 ; Non-Dominant , Y=0.251x + 2.629 ; ( Y : 1RM , x : Isometric ) ] low standard error estimation value ( Dominant , 0.74 ; Non-dominant , 0.80 ) . The result also show significant difference derive equation Brzycki 1RM prediction equation . Therefore , conclude prediction equation use interchangeably predict strength person , thus IMMC use predict 1RM healthy female .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A dynamic isotonic muscle contraction ( ITMC ) cause joint movement excursion body segment muscle contract shorten lengthens tension . One repetition maximum ( RM ) define maximum weight person lift complete range motion . It gold standard measure muscular strength therefore use strength training programme . The 1RM test show reliable various population . Further , set intensity resistance training base percentage 1RM find effective improve outcomes muscle strength , muscle power , muscle hypertrophy . Many study show increase strength RM testing repeat several day week . Therefore , test protocol suggest strength measure ; typically 2 3 testing session recommend . A familiarisation process prior 1RM strength test necessary ensure reliable test result , minimize learn effect systemic bias . It show without familiarisation process prior strength testing , significant increase expression muscle strength . In many study , investigator suggest old individual need 8—9 session 1RM test order increase consistency 1RM measurement . Therefore , multiple familiarization session beneficial RM measurement . This draw u thought session may practical study examine train outcome record strength change several different resistance exercise well numerous functional parameter . This unnecessarily increase time requirement extend duration study , might increase likelihood participant dropout study loss interest exercise client . In measure 1RM , especially patient , use heavy weight large number repetition impose great risk injury . Having say , 1RM measurement require long period test consistent value ; also require familiarization technique also intense extensive procedure . To avoid risk , related measurement 1RM , many study conduct produce regression equation predict 1RM strength . There study undertake determine accuracy equation . Prediction 1RM strength allows exercise specialist ass individual 's maximal lifting capacity without subject novice lifter increase risk associate 1RM lift . The advantage calculate 1RM use formula , provide therapist widely accept measure strength without risk associate formal 1RM test . However 1RM load lifting also require great concentration considerable mental preparation subject extremely intense experience leave unsure scar . Although real data concern risk injury test , potential risk may significantly increase use heavy load . Testing 1RM us isotonic movement may associate increase risk injury may include high speed movement , inability spread workload evenly entire ROM , unsafe pathological joint , delay onset muscle soreness , requirement equipment expensive , increased risk injury , movement do incorrectly . Measuring 1 RM use traditional way use prediction equation , involve risk , therefore bring u idea use isometric type movement predict 1RM . Isometric contraction static form exercise muscle contract produce force without appreciable change length muscle without visible joint motion . It popular method test isometric strength particular muscle . It easy , fast accurate method test strength muscle . Isometric measurement Lafayette Manual Muscle Test System ( model 01163 ) proven highly reliable inter-class coefficient 0.85 . This method eliminate risk factor observe measure 1 RM use traditional way prediction equation . Furthermore , cost effective , convenient do , aggravate sensitive joint surface . Therefore reduces risk involve measure 1RM use traditional way use prediction equation . However , worth mentioning , isometric strength measurement replace 1RM measurement dynamic method . Blazevich et al study reliability validity two isometric squat ( IS ) test , report IS isometric rack show significant high correlation ( r = 0.77 ) 1RM squat . However , Demura , S study relationship 1RM isometric measurement squat ( IS ) , study show component ( wide stance parallel depth ) squat correlate well 1 RM whereas others . Simple linear regression analysis study reveal relationship Y = 0.992X + 30.3 ( Y : 1RM , X : IS ) . This suggest IS use back dynamometer may become effective index predict 1RM squat . However , since standard error estimate provide regression equation quite large , ( 11.19 kg ) therefore , could estimate 1RM non-athletes ; study conclude estimate 1RM Isometric squat use back dynamometer maybe difficult . Though study conduct estimate 1RM isometric strength measurement , dearth literature prove . Therefore investigator aim find isometric strength compare 1RM female subject without weight training experience . Hence purpose study find comparison 1RM ( Brzycki 's prediction equation ) measurement isometric MVC use digital hand-held dynamometer healthy female .</detailed_description>
