	<detailed_description>Epidemiological data provide evidence manifold increase rate depression anxiety individual diagnose multiple sclerosis , relative general population . Such impaired affective process , include deficit emotion regulation link great cognitive deficit , low quality life , great disease progression population . Despite evidence deleterious impact affective functioning prevalence rate mood anxiety disorder ; poor cognitive functioning ; reduce quality life , much target intervention research MS directly test feasibility , subsequent efficacy psychosocial intervention improve affective regulation population . Thus , investigator propose conduct randomize feasibility study mindfulness train relative active cognitive training control group waitlist control group improve emotional regulation individual MS. All individual contact Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory ( CNLab ) interest study undergo phone screen assess inclusion/exclusion criterion . Those participant meet I/E criterion invite online daily diary portion study examine daily engagement worry rumination . After complete week-long daily diary portion study , participant attend 1-2 in-person pre-assessment session , also complete completion four week intervention . The pre-assessment involve thorough assessment emotion regulation skill , self-report questionnaire behavioral paradigm , cognitive functioning . Following assessment session , conduct blind assessor , participant randomize three group . The 4-week mindfulness program closely model protocol develop Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn , investigator participant attend once-per-week session 2 hour complete around 40 minute day homework assignment . The four week mindfulness involve practice concentrative attention , different object use focus practice . For example , first two week , investigator use breath anchor mind . With repeated practice , object sensation , emotion , think process introduce . The class mixture experiential practice , discussion surround experience , didactics mindfulness . The control group , use compare effect mindfulness train emotional cognitive function MS patient , comprise cognitive training group , provide attentional-training base approach . In group , focus provide individual cognitive training task complete show improve attentional ability . Homework read practice use cognitive video game exercise duration , around 40 minute daily , mindfulness group . Following four week intervention , questionnaire , week-long daily diary , behavioral test pretest repeat second time obtain post-test data comparison .</detailed_description>
