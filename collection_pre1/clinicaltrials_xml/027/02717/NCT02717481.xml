	<brief_summary>Examine new method base fusion ultrasound ( US ) previous ultrasound/computerized tomography ( US/CT ) study evaluate size abdominal aneurysm measure change time follow invasive repair procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using US Evaluate Aortic Aneurysm Size Based 3D Co-registration Previous CT Scan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selection test assess aortic aneurysm CT angio , perform injection contrast material allow complete demonstration blood vessel . This test expose patient ionize radiation injection iodine contrast medium . Repeated test pose risk develop malignancy future due use ionize radiation risk renal impairment allergic reaction due injection contrast material . Ultrasound another test enable detection evaluation aortic aneurysm . Patients know diagnosis aortic aneurysm detect CT require continuous monitoring light growth time risk rupture . Using Co-registration US device enable conduct US direct aorta examination , use information produce CT `` roadmap '' detection localization aneurysm . That theoretically improve detection capability characteristic aneurysm outcomes invasive treatment .</detailed_description>
