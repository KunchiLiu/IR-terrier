	<brief_title>Trial Panobinostat Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Description This multicenter , phase 1 trial Panobinostat ( LBH589 ) child diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma tumor . Panobinostat pan-HDAC inhibitor Class I , II IV histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) involve deacetylation histone non-histone cellular protein . Panobinostat inhibit purify total cellular histone deacetylase activity ( IC50 = 0.03 uM ) activity HDAC isoforms ( IC50 &lt; 10nM ) . In addition , panobinostat induces expression cell-cycle control gene include CDKN1A ( p21 ) , selectively inhibit proliferation variety tumor cell compare normal cell . It extensively profile vitro vivo pharmacological activity variety tumor cell line tumor xenograft mouse model . Based vitro vivo activity panobinostat preclinical model use DIPG cell culture orthotopic xenograft model system , potentially important role histone deacetylases histone 3 K27M mutation relation pontine malignancy , investigator conduct Phase 1 study panobinostat child recurrent/progressive DIPG . The primary objective study ( 1 ) describe toxicity profile define dose- limit toxicity panobinostat child recurrent/progressive DIPG ; ( 2 ) estimate maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend Phase 2 dose panobinostat child recurrent/progressive DIPG ; ( 3 ) evaluate characterize plasma pharmacokinetics panobinostat child recurrent/progressive DIPG . Schema Only patient recurrent progressive DIPG enrol initially . Panobinostat administer every day , 3 times/week , p.o . preferably Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule three week , follow rest period . Three week therapy plus one week rest period ( total 4 week ) constitute one course . Treatment continue two year ( 26 course ) unless patient experience progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity off-study criterion . The start dose ( dose level 1 ) 10 mg/m2/day . Below propose dose level study : Dose level # Panobinostat oral dose ( mg ) Minimum BSA Restriction 0* : 5 mg/m2/day MWF , three week , one week ( 1 course = 28 day ) . Patients must BSA ≥ 0.80 m2 . 1 ( start dose level ) : 10 mg/m2/day MWF , three week , one week , ( 1 course = 28 day ) . Patients must BSA ≥ 0.65 m2 . 2 : 16 mg/m2/day MWF , three week , one week , ( 1 course = 28 day ) . Patients must BSA ≥ 0.65 m2 . 3 : 22 mg/m2/day MWF , three week , one week , ( 1 course = 28 day ) . Patients must BSA ≥ 0.65 m2 . 4 : 28 mg/m2/day MWF , three week , one week , ( 1 course = 28 day ) . Patients must BSA ≥ 0.50 m2 . 5 : 36 mg/m2/day MWF , three week , one week , ( 1 course = 28 day ) . Patients must BSA ≥ 0.50 m2 . Panobinostat administer single agent * Dose level 0 represent potential treatment dose patient require dose reduction dose level 1 may use contingency dose level start dose level panobinostat tolerate initial cohort .</detailed_description>
