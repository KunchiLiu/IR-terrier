	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein pembrolizumab work treat patient urothelial ( bladder ) cancer spread primary site place body come back respond certain chemotherapy drug . Combinations biological substance recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may able carry tumor-killing substance directly urothelial cancer cell . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein pembrolizumab together may better treatment patient urothelial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Therapy With Pembrolizumab sEphB4-HSA Previously Treated Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility use pembrolizumab-recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein ( sEphB4-HSA ) combination patient advance urothelial carcinoma . II . To measure overall survival ( OS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To measure objective response rate ( ORR ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) , program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) , program cell death 1 ligand 2 ( PD-L2 ) EPH receptor B4 ( EphB4 ) expression tumor cell ( TC ) well immune cell ( IC ) - macrophage T cells- tumor tissue correlate ORR , PFS OS . II . To examine tumor tissue T cell frequency ( count ) , tumor tissue T cell clonality use T cell receptor ( TCR ) sequencing , peripheral blood T cell clonality , pre-treatment post-treatment correlate ORR , PFS OS . III . To measure phenotype lymphocyte myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) , pre post-treatment blood sample correlate ORR , PFS OS ; extra blood sample future study also collect bank . IV . To examine peripheral blood circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) enumeration molecular analysis pre post-treatment blood sample , correlate ORR , PFS OS . V. To collect bank tumor tissue . VI . To examine role add positron emission tomography ( PET ) contrast compute tomography ( CT ) evaluation response treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6-12 week .</detailed_description>
