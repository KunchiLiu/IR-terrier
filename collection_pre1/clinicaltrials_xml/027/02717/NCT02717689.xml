	<brief_title>A Pragmatic Trial Corticosteroid Optimisation Severe Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma affect estimate 300 million people worldwide population prevalence ca 15 % UK . The WHO estimate UK disability adjust life-years per 100,000 population asthma great diabetes breast cancer . Much excessive disability 10-20 % patient asthma difficult control despite currently available therapy . This high morbidity disproportionate use health care resource reflect considerable unmet need patient group , significance health care provider . Asthma traditionally 'stratified ' basis response 'step-wise ' incremental treatment inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy form cornerstone approach . However , recently , asthma stratify basis inflammatory phenotype well understand disease heterogeneity view develop biomarkers therapeutic response well target new exist treatment . Investigators recently examine predictive value composite biomarker strategy use FeNO , blood eosinophil serum periostin together predict exacerbation risk placebo arm clinical trial . Investigators propose examine composite biomarker strategy predict exacerbation risk patient asthma high dose ICS ( +/-long-acting beta agonist ) treatment evaluate utility composite score facilitate personalise biomarker specific titration corticosteroid therapy population . This study examine subject FeNO &lt; 45 ppb score system potentially allow identification 'low-risk ' group safely reduce corticosteroid dose . This study address second important question estimate proportion patient severe disease develop typical ( T2 ) -driven eosinophilic inflammation progressive corticosteroid withdrawal .</detailed_description>
