	<brief_summary>It estimate 10 % men age 60 experience episode urinary retention period 5 year need urethral catheter . Some patient discharge hospital urethral catheter , attend Trial Without Catheter ( TWOC ) clinic later date catheter removal . Traditionally catheter remove clinic nurse wait 5 hour patient get urge pas urine empty bladder . The main objective study see effect catheter valve length clinic stay ( time discharge ) patient ( men age 60-85 ) catheter remove . In study randomization , patient Group A ( catheter valve group ) give catheter valve send home catheter.They ask close valve 3-4 hour ( time require adequate filling bladder , mean minimum 250 ml bladder natural filling ) appointment . It likely time patient see TWOC clinic bladder already full void soon removal catheter.The patient Group B ( control ) go home free drainage catheter urine bag ( standard catheter removal ) . These patient arrival , TWOC clinic empty bladder catheter remove , drink plenty fluid clinic wait bladder full void spontaneously . This study last one year approval ethical committee . The time save process would lessen patient anxiety , lead patient review clinic therefore reduce wait time TWOC clinic save money .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Catheter Valve Vs. Standard Catheter Removal Outpatients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men discharge hospital urinary catheter situ give appointment come trial TWOC ( trail without catheter ) clinic removal catheter . Purpose design : In TWOC clinic catheter remove usually wait 5 hour hour get urge pas urine empty bladder send home nurse . Waiting 5 hour clinic reduces patient satisfaction increase anxiety . It also keep urology nurse busy clinic . This show clinical audit , carry department . The aim study find way reduce wait time patient . In study catheter valve use see significantly reduces time spend patient TWOC clinic catheter removal . The patient catheter valve group compare patient use valve ( standard method currently use TWOC clinic ) . Catheter valve device , attached end urinary catheter use easily one normal manual dexterity cognitive impairment . The study proposal develop lead urology nurse practitioner endorse consultant urological surgeon three different hospital Kent UK ( Medway Maritime Hospital , Darent Valley Hospital Maidstone Hospital ) . Recruitment : Patients identify recruited hospital ward . The patient plan go home catheter provide patient information leaflet study . They give 6 hour decide want participate study . Those patient agree participate ask sign write informed consent . A computer-generated randomisation carry . They give contact number urology nurse case problem want ask question attend TWOC clinic . A day discharge urology nurse practitioner ring patient home check patient still want participate study . A day appointment TWOC clinic urology nurse ring patient ( Group A , valve group ) remind appointment also remind close valve 3-4 hour appointment time patient group ( Group A Group B ) drink three glass water come hospital catheter removal . Patients inform withdraw study point . Inclusion exclusion : A strict inclusion exclusion criterion observe . Vulnerable men learn difficulties/dementia/Alzheimer 's disease poor manual dexterity include . Consent : Written inform consent use patient read patient information leaflet study verbally explain patient researcher . Risks , burden benefit There potential risk patient associate plan intervention.The vulnerable adult learn difficulties/Dementia poor manual dexterity exclude . In intervention arm ( GROUP A : patient valve ) patient may get pain strong desire pas urine start bypass catheter much 3 hour close valve . In case patient instruct open valve drain urine . ( These patient exclude ) . If significant reduction ( one hour ) time spend clinic valve group note study help decrease patient 's anxiety , improve efficacy TWOC clinic reduce cost run TWOC clinic . Confidentiality : The data record electronically save password protect computer . The researcher statistician access . Conflict interest : There conflict interest . All researcher sign form .</detailed_description>
