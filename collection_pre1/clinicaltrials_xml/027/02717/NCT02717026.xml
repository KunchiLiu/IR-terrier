	<brief_summary>Retinal blood flow measurement scientific clinical value . For purpose retinal vessel morphology ( diameter , vessel wall thickness , etc ) determination crucial . Different image modality might provide divergent result . Thus , quantification difference valuable . The present study aim reveal quantify difference vessel morphology fundus photography , fundus angiography , optical coherence tomography health disease .</brief_summary>
