	<brief_summary>Rationale : Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) widespread liver disorder Western society ( prevalence 20-30 % ) . It strongly associate overweight obesity . The majority patient simple steatosis . However , 15-30 % subject , chronic inflammatory state develops refer non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , lead overall increase morbidity mortality due progression fibrosis , cirrhosis case , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The term NAFLD comprise simple steatosis NASH . Most patient NAFLD , mainly aspecific symptom ; generally silent progression simple steatosis NASH end , liver-related morbidity mortality . To date , liver biopsy sensitive test detect stag NAFLD , reliable method differentiate NASH simple steatosis . However , procedure obtain liver biopsy invasive associate patient discomfort , significant complication high cost . In addition , liver biopsy prone sample error inter- intra-observer variability , due small size liver biopsy sample . This method therefore suitable screen large number subject risk , follow-up patient NASH time . Hence , subject high risk ( usually base upon elevated aminotransferase level , specific presence NASH ) biopsied , lead underestimation NASH prevalence undertreatment . Further insight disease mechanism risk factor NAFLD particular NASH warrant , enable early diagnosis , adequate therapy preventive measure improve health status individual . Accurate less invasive method evaluate NASH , NAFLD , urgently need . Objective : The primary objective study establish non-invasive tool ( e.g . biomarkers image ) accurately diagnose patient NASH . The secondary objective show association level identify marker disease severity . Study design : Eligible subject include via outpatient clinic Zuyderland Heerlen , Catharina hospital Eindhoven MUMC+ Maastricht . A subset eligible subject undergone liver biopsy clinical reason . It estimate 85 % subject ask undergo biopsy study purpose . Liver biopsy study purpose perform surgical procedure , e.g . bariatric surgery cholecystectomy . Blood , faeces exhale air collect FibroScan ( +CAP ) perform study visit . An MRI perform , estimate degree steatosis . Furthermore , anthropometric data ( weight , height , abdominal waist circumference blood pressure ( BP ) ) collect . The participant group undergo liver biopsy bariatric surgery ask permission approach follow-up measurement 3 month post-surgery . As lose weight , associate improvement hepatic steatosis , enable assessment possible change time . A routine follow-up visit post-surgery take place 3 month . The follow-up measurement combine visit , minimize burden participant . The measurement consist blood , faeces exhale air collection FibroScan ( +CAP ) perform study visit . Furthermore , weight , height , BP abdominal waist circumference measure . Study population : Subjects prove NAFLD histology NAFLD proven image , undergo surgery ( i.e . bariatric surgery cholecystectomy ) ask participate study . Furthermore , subject 18 65 year old . Main study parameters/endpoints : Non-invasive tool base biomarkers image diagnose NASH .</brief_summary>
