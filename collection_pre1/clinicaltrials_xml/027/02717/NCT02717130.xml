	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , longitudinal , within-subject comparison study effect aripiprazole monthly 30- , 90- , 180-day psychiatric re-hospitalization rate follow hospital discharge subject schizophrenia compare prior psychiatric hospitalization rate oral antipsychotic . Prospective subject undergo screen eligibility entry study hospitalize symptom due schizophrenia . Prospective subject hospitalize necessary length time determine assigned treatment provider clinically indicate , per current standard care . To eligible , anticipated duration hospitalization long enough accommodate screening procedure , 3-day Oral Tolerability Phase ( applicable ) , initiation treatment aripiprazole monthly . During Screening Period , subject treat oral antipsychotic medication clinician 's choice , exception clozapine olanzapine . However , oral olanzapine permit Screening Period subject eligible Phase A . Following Screening Period , subject history aripiprazole use enter Phase A , Oral Tolerability Phase . Subjects Phase A demonstrate tolerability aripiprazole enter Phase B ( i.e. , Treatment Phase ) . Subjects already history tolerate least three consecutive oral dos aripiprazole enter directly Phase B . All eligible subject eventually enter Phase B . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion history oral aripiprazole use enter Phase A Screening Period still hospitalize . Subjects Phase A administered oral aripiprazole , indicate product labeling , determine tolerability . Dosage base symptom judgment investigator . The dose oral aripiprazole may titrate need . Prior antipsychotic medication taper discontinued Screening Period Phase A clinically appropriate . During Phase A , tolerability oral aripiprazole evaluate daily minimum 3 day use safety tolerability measure ( i.e. , AIMS , BARS , SAS ) conjunction clinical judgment . If subject show tolerability oral aripiprazole , Phase B baseline/Day 1 occur first aripiprazole monthly injection give immediately Phase B baseline/Day1 assessment . If subject unable tolerate oral aripiprazole tolerability assessment Phase A , withdrawn study . During Phase B , subject receive first aripiprazole monthly intramuscular ( IM ) injection , conjunction first 14 dos concomitant oral aripiprazole , indicate product labeling , baseline data collect . All subject must attend schedule visit Baseline Visit Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , total 180 day . Aripiprazole monthly injection occur Baseline Visit every 28 ( -2 , +5 ) day Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , total seven injection . After initial injection 400 mg , monthly dosage decrease 300 mg , base clinical judgment investigator . All aripiprazole monthly injection administer base investigator 's judgment prescribing information . For subject psychiatrically stabilize discharge prior completion require 14-day course oral aripiprazole , pre-discharge assignment give community support worker ( CSW ) . The CSW maintain regular contact subject first outpatient visit Phase B ( Week 2 ) , oral aripiprazole discontinue . Regular contact define less weekly , frequent depend clinical judgment CSW outpatient treatment team . Following Week 2 Visit , subject contact assign CSW base routine clinical care . Contact CSW person telephone , clinically appropriate . Note : All long-acting antipsychotic exclude use study ; however , aripiprazole monthly allow</detailed_description>
