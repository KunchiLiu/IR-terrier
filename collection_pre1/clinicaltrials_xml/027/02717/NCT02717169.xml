	<brief_summary>Background : The interaction human being wearable technology like activity tracker equip biometric sensor link health related new learn concepts/instructional method support deep knowledge acquisition , situate , self-regulated active learning . This personalized , long term interaction specific information push learner contributes deepen personal understanding relate concept knowledge health impact long term health action process . Design method : In order understand behavioural change process , multiple case study include 35 high education student Hong Kong undergraduate course , BSc Exercise Health currently conduct . Each student use wearable device ( activity tracker ) period five month , reflect weekly emerge personal data , document think action ePortfolio , engage online forum . The participant enter experience biometric data , lifestyle adaptation ( e.g . step ) , special situation ( e.g . hike , heart rate change activity ) experience lead specific search action web and/or real social network . The ePortfolio allow student critically reflect progress researcher intervene time issue related participant ' posting . EHealth literacy use indicator health action process participant . Evidence regard change eHealth begin end intervention collect standard questionnaire detect eHealth literacy scale . Scope : By reflect information personal activity tracker document ePortfolio , student continuously learn analyse , search critically assess health relate personal available digital information , organize , present discus peers/tutor . This turn enhance critical thinking , raise question health related topic , stimulate inquiry deepen knowledge personal health , induce healthy lifestyle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Bridging know-do gap one important challenge public health century . It also pose great opportunity strengthen health system . Health knowledge , education , refers knowledge understand individual health-related issue . It important understand benefit health cause ill-health recognize extent vulnerable , risk , health threat . In word , knowledge necessary component behavioral change . Health knowledge important sufficient factor order provoke behavioral change toward healthy life style . Knowing something beneficial risk health perceive chance threat . Schwarzer propose Health Action Process Approach help bridge know - gap underlining importance adoption , initiation , maintenance health behavior conceive structured process include motivation phase volition phase . The propose study foster acquisition maintenance health behavior like activity form amount step perform day , sleep behavior monitoring heart rate . The context describe interaction human being wearable technology take place , link learn concept instructional method like knowledge building , situate , self-regulated active learning . In situated learn important create meaning real activity daily live learn also occur informal setting connects prior knowledge new context . According recent reserach researcher , selfregulated student student metacognitively , motivationally , behaviorally engage learn process achieve goal . Active learn refers instructional method engage student ( actively ) learn process . Active learning require student meaningful learning activity reflect . Reserachers describe Knowledge building activity result creation modification call public knowledge , knowledge life 'in world ' available work . Wearable technology also provide vehicle act motivator effective use IT tool resource internet information medium channel . Students ' learn work , real data deliver long period time , experience may become critical encountered information derive source develop literacy relate use digital information order enhance health . This literacy call eHealth literacy . eHealth literacy well developed student high education . Wearable technology like wristwatch tracker open opportunity development new literacy especially eHealth literacy deliver real-time , situate , personal information . Having access data critically use stimulate individual ' interest health issue mediate deployment interact new literacy locate engage health information resource . Methodology : Procedure data collection To understand qualitative aspect change eHealth literacy semi-structured interview pre post intervention conduct sub-group 35 student . During one academic semester 35 student course : 'Physical Activity health ' recruit . Participants ask sign ethic clearance consent participate study include permission publish result study anonymizing provenience collect data . Students high education institution Hong Kong age 18 year . To understand eHealth literacy development high education Hong Kong exist ePortfolio tool use . Each participant use wearable device period five month ( 1 semester ) , reflect emerge personal data , document think share communicate participant ( optional ) ePortfolio . The ePortfolio allow researcher intervene time ask question related participant reflection . Evidence regard change eHealth literacy begin end intervention collect well-established questionnaire . The questionnaire use Pre Post intervention . Interviews data reflection forum post analyze triangulated understand emerge issue influence development eHealth literacy . After establish case report participant cross-case analysis perform . The participant ask reflect weekly use tracker . It enable participant enter experience biometric data , like relevance difference sensor data , lifestyle adaptation ( like e.g . sleep ) , special situation ( e.g . hike , change heart rate activity ) experience lead specific search action web and/or real social network . Students able publish different format reflection text , hyperlink health relate web page image . The quality material , collect publish within ePortfolio tool , show improve previously conduct pilot work development tool . The created ePortfolio expect provide fundamental platform meaningful sustainable interaction student teacher continuous construction knowledge towards undergraduate programme ' intend learning outcome . It expect enhance metacognition learn repeat reflection . This assessed suggest previously . Students access reflection retrieve past event reflective ePortfolio , describe . Study design methodology The present research employ multi case methodology study explicate affordances wearable tracker , emerge ten student use technology . The study constitute inductive , hypotheses generate naturalistic inquiry , whose aim accumulate understand propose recommendation relevant study context . It focus large picture , whole picture , begin search understanding whole . The research finding provide broad picture event take place particular context , allow reader draw conclusion . The sample size present study , conduct 5 month exemplary group 35 student across four key area , sufficiently large multi case methodology study . The interview data collect research assistant principal investigator . The questionnaire data collect research assistant . The data tracker ( individual reflection biometric data ) automatically record database . Interview questionnaire take place University , 30 minute interview , 20 minute questionnaire ( 1 hour 40 minute participant ) . A consistency technique apply across 35 case allow comparability . The adopted case study methodology adequate retrieve well root set argument recommendation related learn process perform 35 student intervention relate eHealth literacy .</detailed_description>
