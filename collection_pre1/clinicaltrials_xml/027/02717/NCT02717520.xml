	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate long-term clinical performance glass hybrid restorative system ( glass-ionomer ) vs. composite resin material period five year . The secondary objective evaluate suitability intraoral impression assessment wear teeth restorative material five year . For purpose replica method scan 3-D laser equipment match software use . The first null hypothesis would difference clinical performance restorative material five year . The second null hypothesis wear restorative material five year . This multicentre , control clinical study conduct Croatia , Italy , Turkey Serbia . Eligible participant adult age 18 indication restorative treatment vital teeth posterior molar region , limit two surface healthy subject . Exclusion criterion presence full dentures crown bridge occlusal contact teeth indicate restorative treatment , severe bruxing unstable physiological medical health , pregnancy lactation , radiation therapy use drug . Each patient receive two restorative treatment ( GIC-EQUIA Forte composite resin material Tetric EvoCeram ) localize molar teeth either side mouth . Two independent examiner evaluate restoration site one week placement one , two , three , four five year accord FDI criterion . After , three five year recall , impression restoration take cast analyse 3D laser scanner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Clinical Evaluation Posterior Glass Hybrid System vs. Composite Resin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tooth vitality confirm cold test ( ethyl chloride ) registrated . Bleeding gingiva record use periodontal probe . Local anesthesia apply prevent pain discomfort cavity preparation . Tooth surface clean use commercial non fluoride prophy paste ( Cleanic , fluoride free , Kerr dental ) . The cavity preparation perform remove old filling or/and open carious lesion use round cylindric diamond bur ( Komet ) . Round tungsten carbide bur ( Komet ) hand instrument use excavate carious dentine group . For composite resin restoration , sound dentin verification base probe tactile sensation . No marginal bevel prepare horizontal platform ( avoid apical shift ) approximal box make . Before placement material , impression take registrate cavity depth . Restorations EQUIA Forte ( GC corp. , Tokyo , Japan ) place accord manufacturer recommendation . The site isolated cotton roll . A sectional metal matrix system wedge place . GC cavity conditioner ( 20 % polyacrylic acid , GC ) apply 10 sec. , rinse cavity dry cotton pellet . EQUIA Forte ( GC ) prepare accord manufacturer instruction , apply bulk compact condenser . The self-curing restoration finish hardening , approximately 2 minute 30 second start capsule mixing , use Arkansas stone water cool . Occlusion articulation check use two side colour articulate paper ( blue occlusion red articulation ) 20 micron thickness . EQUIA Forte restoration rinse gently dry . EQUIA Forte Coat ( GC ) apply surface use micro-tip applicator . The coated surface light cure D-light ( GC ) 20 second . Patients instruct eat one hour restoration placement . For composite resin restoration , rubber-dam apply , matrix system use . Enamel etch 37 % orthophosphoric acid ( Ivoclar Vivadent , Schaan , Liechtenstein ) 10 sec. , avoid etch dentine much possible . The acid gel rinse air-water spray cavity carefully dry mild stream air etch enamel appear white-frosted dentin dull ( avoid over-dry dentine surface ) . The adhesive ( Adhese 2 , Ivoclar Vivadent ) apply accord manufacturer 's instruction light cure D-light ( GC , 1200 mW/cm2 , slow mode ) 10 sec . The composite resin ( Tetric EvoCeram , Ivoclar Vivadent ) place incremental technique ( 2 mm layer ) . Composite light-cured D-light ( 20 sec ) occlusal direction place light tip close possible restoration . After remove matrix , additional light cure perform vestibular palatal/lingual direction . Finishing perform use diamond bur . Restorations finish fine diamond bur high-speed hand-piece gross finishing ( Komet ) follow fine carbide bur slow speed hand-piece fine finishing ( Komet ) . Occlusion articulation check use two side colour articulate paper ( blue red ) 20 micron thickness . Polishing perform use flexible polish disc ( Komet ) , rubber point ( Compo system , Komet ) diamond particle paste ( 1Î¼m ) ( Gradia diapolisher ) . Fine polish stripe use proximal surface contact point . One week placement restoration , baseline evaluation perform follow-up evaluation do yearly base five year . Two experience , blind , calibrate examiner ( e-calib ) perform clinical procedure evaluate restoration . Evaluation do use loop ( magnification x 2.5 ) . Impressions obtain procedure , cavity preparation , baseline , three five year directly scan use 3D laser scan device ( GC Aadva Lab scan ) . After direct impression scanning , gypsum cast ( GC Fujirock EP OptiXscan ) also make ( baseline , three five year ) . These model scan wear analysis GC Aadva software order compare two different evaluation method . At baseline every recall , four photo take : one photo occlusal view , buccal view , oral view direct view .</detailed_description>
