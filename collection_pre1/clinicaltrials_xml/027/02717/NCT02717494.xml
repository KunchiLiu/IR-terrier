	<detailed_description>This multi-center , Phase II , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) -infected pregnant woman Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) second third trimester pregnancy infant . The study design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity , transplacental antibody transfer interference infant response childhood vaccination maternal vaccination PCV-10 PPV-23 comparison placebo . Mothers randomize one three arm receive PCV-10 , PPV-23 , placebo blind fashion . They follow safety , immunogenicity vaccine-specific anti-capsular pneumococcus ( PNC ) antibody persistence 24 week post-delivery . Women receive placebo randomize second study step receive PCV-10 PPV-23 24 week post-delivery . Antibody responses vaccine administer 6 month postpartum measure . All infant receive PCV-10 vaccination per local standard care .</detailed_description>
