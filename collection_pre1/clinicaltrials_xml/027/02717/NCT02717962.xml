	<brief_summary>The purpose phase 2 , single arm , biomarker-driven study determine treatment O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) unmethylated recurrent glioblastoma VAL-083 improve overall survival ( OS ) , compare historical control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study VAL-083 Patients With MGMT Unmethylated , Bevacizumab-naive Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) characterize dismal prognosis , median overall survival 6-9 month . While standard care establish initial treatment GBM - radiation concurrent adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy - management recurrent disease remain suboptimal . Treatment option include repeat surgery , re-irradiation , chemotherapy ( include experimental target therapy , biologic agent , immunotherapy ) . Only minority patient response treatment , resultant benefit progression-free overall survival order week month . Prognosis response therapy know well patient methylated MGMT promoter gene . Epigenetic silence MGMT promoter methylation important factor predict outcome patient GBM treat temozolomide . Approximately 66 % GBM tumor MGMT unmethylated ( high expression MGMT ) , MGMT repair mechanism , confers resistance temozolomide , standard chemotherapy treatment GBM . VAL-083 , Dianhydrogalactitol ( DAG ) , unlike temozolomide , demonstrate active independent MGMT resistance mechanism , vitro . Thus , may provide treatment option patient consider likely poor responder temozolomide . This non-comparative , single arm , biomarker-driven study VAL-083 . Forty-eight ( 48 ) eligible patient receive VAL-083 40 mg/m2 IV day 1 , 2 , 3 , 12 , 21-day treatment cycle fulfill one criterion study discontinuation ( disease progression , death , intolerable toxicity , investigator 's judgment , withdrawal consent ) . Disease status evaluate clinical MRI evaluation every 21-day cycle , patient receive VAL-083 treatment , approximately every 42 ± 7 day remain study . Symptom burden evaluate use MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor ( MDASI-BT ) complete patient baseline time image evaluation . Interval medical history , target physical exam , neurologic evaluation , complete blood count , laboratory safety assessment perform approximately every 21-days . Blood sample take Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose , 15 ± 5 min , 30 ± 5 min , 60 ± 10 min , 120 ± 10 min , 240 ± 15 min , 360 ± 15 min end iv infusion VAL-083 determine PK profile dose-exposure relationship VAL-083 . Toxicity evaluate documented use NCI CTCAE version 4 . This study take approximately 32 month enroll .</detailed_description>

Patients must histologically confirm initial diagnosis primary intracranial World Health Organization ( WHO ) Grade IV malignant glioma ( glioblastoma , GBM ) , recurrent . Patients recurrent disease whose initial diagnostic pathology confirm glioblastoma need rebiopsy . Alternately , patient prior intracranial lowgrade glioma anaplastic glioma eligible , histologic assessment demonstrate transformation GBM ( first diagnosis secondary GBM ) . Patients must radiographic evidence recurrent/progressive GBM prior therapy ( biopsy resection chemoradiation ) ; 1st recurrence GBM , per Response Assessment NeuroOncology Criteria ( RANO ) criterion . Histologically document transformation lower grade glioma consider first recurrence . Patients must confirm GBM MGMT status ( tumor must MGMT promoter unmethylated ) central laboratory Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify test MD Anderson , prior registration . If initial MGMT testing obtain outside institution , MGMT status must centrally retested MD Anderson . Patients must Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) &gt; 60 % . Patients must previously treat GBM radiation concurrent adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy . Adequate recovery recent surgery require . At least 21days must elapse time major surgery , include craniotomy/tumor resection . Patients must recover surgeryrelated toxicity Grade 1 less . Patients must ≥ 12 week radiotherapy , minimize potential magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) change relate treatment ( pseudo progression ) might misdiagnosed true progression disease , unless patient fulfills criterion early progressive disease RANO . Prior therapy gamma knife focal highdose radiation allow , least 2 week must elapse time treatment , patient must subsequent histologic documentation recurrence , unless recurrence new lesion outside irradiated field .
