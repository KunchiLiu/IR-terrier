	<brief_title>Making Sense Out Total Knee Sensor Assisted Technology : A Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare group total knee arthroplasty patient receive sensor guidance technology soft tissue balance intra operatively group patient receive surgeon guide soft tissue balance . Patients randomize either experimental group sensor guide technology control group surgeon guide technique current standard care . All patient sensor place intra operatively measurement capture record however , measurement patient sensor guide group reveal surgeon . The information gather post enrollment data analysis . The patient measurement sensor guide group reveal surgeon surgeon use information order help guide soft tissue balance optimal alignment intra operatively . Patients follow 1 year post operatively . Patient report outcomes measure KSS , KOOS , PROMIS PF CAT , EQ-5D UCLA activity collect preoperatively 3 month , 6 month , 12 month . Post-operative Likert scale patient satisfaction score also collect . All outcomes score compare determine significance .</detailed_description>
