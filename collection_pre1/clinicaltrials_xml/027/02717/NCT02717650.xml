	<brief_summary>Exercise test become clinically important management ongoing evaluation patient Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) high rate exercise tolerance participation previously link low mortality risk ( 1 ) . Lower exercise capacity generally correlate severe lung disease ( 2,3 ) landmark study suggest low exercise capacity measure peak oxygen capacity ( VO2peak ) rate decline lung function ( FEV1 ) strong predictor mortality ( 1,4 ) . However study find pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) reliable predictor maximal exercise capacity ( 5 ) , especially relatively well preserve lung function ( 6,7 ) . The wide distribution physical capacity fit individual end stage disease add complexity assessment . Independent factor age , genetics , habitual exercise , nutritional status musculoskeletal condition know influence physical capacity patient CF ( 8,9 ) . Maximal exercise test place additional stress cardiovascular , respiratory peripheral system provide information around multiple influence disease progression include degree limitation major system ( 10,11 ) useful assessment exercise desaturation , common ( always present ) advance lung disease ( 5,12 ) .

	<detailed_description>Many international center regard exercise test highly important many measure maximal exercise capacity annually monitor disease progression , identify physical status drive change medical , physiotherapy nutritional management ( 14,15 ) . Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing ( CPET ) : The current best practice assess VO2max adult CF CPET use Godfrey Protocol , progressive incremental maximal test perform cycle ergometer ( 13,14,15 ) . Exercise test aim achieve maximal response within time frame 8-12 min incremental protocols stage duration 1 minute consider efficient elicit desire response within time frame ( 14 ) . During CPET , VO2max determine breath-by-breath gas analysis allow comprehensive assessment exercise ventilation circulation . This information identify reason low exercise capacity whether exercise limitation due deconditioning , primarily within respiratory , cardiovascular peripheral system . CPET perform use specialist ergometer , require specialist clinical expertise , monitor report equipment interpretation test . The cost , space expertise carry CPET CF unit around world may limit use regular assessment exercise capacity adult CF ( 16 ) . Field Tests : Field test generally determine absolute maximal exercise capacity , provide valuable information patient 's functional ability limitation compare laboratory test inexpensive easy administer . Field test use single step assessment exercise tolerance patient chronic lung disease include : 3-Minute Step Test ( 3MST ) : The 3MST feasible acceptable measure sub-maximal exercise performance child adult useful tool assessment oxygen desaturation ( 17,18 ) . The test short duration , simple carry , low cost minimal space equipment requirement however sub-maximal nature ceiling effect 3MST limit usefulness clinically across age spectrum ( 18,19 ) . The Chester Step Test ( CST ) : The CST 10-minute sub-maximal standardized multistage test like 3MST minimal space equipment requirement . The CST originally design workplace screen widely use exercise prescription UK cardiac population ( 20 ) . In healthy individual one study report ceiling effect positive relationship predict VO2max use CST measure VO2max ( 21 ) however subsequent study question prediction validity ( 22 ) . The CST find highly reproducible patient chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) reliable patient Bronchiectasis , challenge group ( 23,24 ) . The Modified Incremental Step Test ( MIST ) : The MIST design suitable COPD patient model CST ( 25 ) . A reduction work rate find result difference cardiopulmonary stress exertion effort peak exercise result high exercise tolerance patient COPD . The MIST reliable well tolerate CST patient Bronchiectasis ( 23,24 ) . The CST CF : One study ( publish abstract form ) show CST useful field test compare 3MST 6MWT mild moderate CF . The author comment likely due progressive nature representative adult physical activity ( 26 ) . The main vision develop standardized incremental step test protocol suitable adult Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) , age , level fitness disease state line current exercise testing recommendation ( 15 ) . The test useful already available field test `` user friendly '' test currently available laboratory exercise test ass exercise tolerance allow early detection decline physical function day-to-day clinical setting . To date study publish adult CF incremental exercise step test investigate assess exercise tolerance determine VO2max . 1 . To design standardize externally paced incremental step test portable , easy administer , simple perform , time , cost space efficient ( A-STEP ) . Study A : 2 . To assess feasibility reliability A-STEP objectively assess exercise tolerance . 3 . To determine A-STEP useful tool 3-Minute Step Test . Study B : 4 . To develop alternative tool determine maximum oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) `` gold standard '' CPET feasible across whole spectrum lung disease . 5 . To determine A-STEPmax valid tool compare VO2max achieve CPET perform cycle ergometer use Godfrey Protocol . The principle investigator hypothesize A-STEP feasible tool ass exercise capacity ; A-STEP max valid tool assessment VO2max across age range disease spectrum adult CF .</detailed_description>
