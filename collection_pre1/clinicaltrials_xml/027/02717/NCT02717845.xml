	<brief_summary>Malalignment knee joint cause arthritis later life . Currently three surgical way treat knee arthritis : total knee replacement , partial knee replacement , high tibial osteotomy ( HTO ) . The former two much focus treat effect malalignment , i.e . remove arthritic joint . However , HTO address cause arthritis , namely joint malalignment . This preserve patient 's joint mean patient start use unaffected part knee joint . HTO involve cut wedge tibia correct alignment bone knee joint , redistribute load affect medial part lateral part . To keep tibia new position , medical nail device attach keep place allow new bone regenerate within wedge . Currently , market leader HTO TomoFix ( DePuySynthes company ) plate nail device . As name suggest , TomoFix fix surgery therefore change bone angle change afterwards . It mean patient weight-bearing affected leg soon HTO procedure . A new CE-marked device test interventional trial ; produce Ellipse Technologies . This device extendable nail insert intramedullary ; follow surgery nail tend slowly extended period time bone correction satisfactory . The CISKO imaging study ass whether difference TomoFix Ellipse system term bone regeneration tibial wedge perform CT-scan 3 6 month post-operatively . This quantify two independent radiological report . A secondary objective investigate patient satisfaction also patient pain level time interval . The degree bone heal usually main factor hold clinician back come advise patient activity return post-operatively . A difference bone heal two system may impact advice clinician give patient regard recommence intense activity recreational sport , ultimately could positively impact patient ' health well-being .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Imaging Study Knee Osteotomy ( CISKO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One treatment modality medial osteoarthritis knee open-wedge high tibial osteotomy ( HTO ) . The current common way perform HTO use fixation plate lock bolt implant patient 's tibia , allow increase stability &amp; joint movement ability weight bear affected leg sooner . However , despite advance high tibial osteotomy technology , still take patient six month fully recover procedure . Sedentary activity usually pick month surgery , physical work introduce 3 4 month surgery , follow sport reintroduce approximately 6-12 month surgery . One reservation allow patient fully weight bear early perceive risk loss correction angle , although practice effect appear rare occurrence . For example , series patient Takeuchi colleague show full weight-bearing possible two week surgery without implication correction make joint angle . It imperative open wedge heal repopulated new bone , strengthen tibia allow full recovery follow HTO . Regeneration take place naturally , although surgeon apply aid promote bone healing , ChronOS β-tricalcium phosphate wedge . However , research aspect fill wedge show advantage use filler - term stability bone healing time wedge . Although fixed system like Tomofix facilitate early weight-bearing affect joint , complete closure consolidation wedge take considerably longer . In one study , 23 /27 ( 85 % ) osteotomies fully heal twelve month procedure . Histologically , variability degree heal indeed maturation bone regeneration achieve tibial wedge . With current fix plate device , even two year post-procedure , minor subset patient significant sign regeneration surgical site . In majority patient , partial bone regeneration fibrocartilaginous tissue take place patient new regenerated fibrocartilage hyaline-like cartilage appear . HTO could improve upon allow early return activity patient achieve good rate heal - term time maturity regenerate bone . Ellipse Technologies devise new nail system high tibial osteotomy differs establish 'locked ' plate nail system . Their system function gradual fashion . The wedge create tibia per normal Ellipse nail insert per day nail extend small measure ( appr 1.5 mm per day ) desire correction achieve . Currently new Ellipse system trialed various country Europe , include Netherlands UK . The main Ellipse trial seek establish whether corrective power medical device accurate plate/nail system use present . The degree bone regeneration open wedge report , detail - e.g . one report radiologist - use standard X-ray imaging primarily use angle measurement . This present study seek explore detail Tomofix Ellipse high-tibial osteotomy system function relation bone regeneration open-wedge create part procedure utilise CT image technique rather standard clinical X-ray imaging . The primary aim osteotomy realignment joint thereby preserve joint patient continue enjoy active life style , sport recreational activity . After osteotomy procedure , whenever patient ask advice clinician start participate unrestricted sport activity , clinician often find difficult answer question . This primarily often difficult quantify bone heal process precisely radiograph . By quantify amount bone heal CT scan clear accurate , clinician confidently advise patient regard participation various sport activity without ambiguity . Further , compare bone heal process Tomofix plate Ellipse nail , investigator make informed judgement regard performance . This research also enhance choice implant selection osteotomy patient base duration bone healing .</detailed_description>
