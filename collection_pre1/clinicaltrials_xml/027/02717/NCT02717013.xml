Over 8 week interventional period calorie restrict group expect lose 3-5 % initial body weight . Anthropometric measure take weekly , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) body composition strength measure 8-weeks intervention . Blood urine collect analyzed 0 , 4 , 8 week . Additionally Dietary record questionnaire concern quality life administer , activity assess use questionnaire pedometer . Muscle biopsy take 8-week study .</detailed_description>
