	<brief_title>The Importance Additional Protein Benefit More From Training During After Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main study : The study design block randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicentre intervention study . A total 120 hospitalize old adult , 70 year , recruit consecutively medical department three Hospitals Capital Region Denmark ( n=40 place ) . Participants randomize two group - one group receive protein-enriched , milk-based supplement group receive iso-energetic placebo product . Both group participate standardize resistance training program , blind supplement content . One training session consist three exercise low extremity ( 3 set 10 repetition , pursue intensity 8-12 repetition maximum ( RM ) ) . While admit , supervise resistance training offer daily . After discharge , participant encourage perform program self-training four time per week.To ensure progression ( regression necessary ) participant receive follow-up home visit physiotherapist , thus discharge participant closely monitor . All participant , irrespective allocation , get daily vitamin D supplement . The study duration participant start admit hospital last 12 week discharge . Endpoint assessment perform baseline ( &gt; 72-h admission hospital ) , discharge ( &gt; 72-h ) 12 week ( ± 2 day ) discharge . A endpoint collect follow-up ( 6 month post intervention ) . Data collect study investigator blind allocation participant . Sub-study : 'Validation portable bio-impedance analyzer population old adult ≥ 70 year assessment muscle mass change muscle mass time ' A sub-study performed investigate portable InBody-230 BIA correlate DXA single time point 30 hospitalized old people ≥ 70 year , see possible track change LBM 12-week intervention . Total LBM , total fat mass , percent LBM measure compare well appendicular trunk LBM . In addition , reliability portable bio-impedance analyzer evaluate assess degree agreement two subsequent measurement . In continuation recruitment primary study , subset participant ( n=30 ) ask want participate sub-study , irrespective allocation main study . The measurement go performed twice , hospitalize 12 week discharge ( ± 5 day ) . Sub-study : 'Prevalence sarcopenia investigation relationship nutritional status EWGSOP conceptual stage sarcopenia hospitalize old patient &gt; 70 year ' . The prevalence classification sarcopenia among Danish hospitalize old patient ≥ 70 year old ( n=120 ) evaluate , accord EWGSOP definition ( Hand-grip-strength , 4-m gait speed , Bio-Impedance analysis ) . Also , examination relationship measurement nutritional status EWGSOP stag sarcopenia ( i.e . sarcopenia , pre-sarcopenia , sarcopenia severe sarcopenia ) assess baseline . Nutritional status assess accord BMI ( &lt; 18.5 , 18.5-20.5 , 20.5-25 , &gt; 25 ) , Mini Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) ( MN , risk MN , MN ) , Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool ( MUST ) ( low risk MN , medium risk MN , high risk MN ) , NRS-2002 ( MN , mild MN , moderate MN , severe MN ) Results communicate general population publish peer-reviewed journal .</detailed_description>
