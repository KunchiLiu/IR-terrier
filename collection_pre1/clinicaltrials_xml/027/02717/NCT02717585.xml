	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia ( FM ) chronic pain disorder associate wide spectrum sleep disorder . In fact , insomnia wake unrefreshed currently consider part criterion diagnosis . Recent study show sleep quality symptom FM inversely correlate . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) sleep disorder characterize repeat episode complete partial blockage upper airway . Nonrestorative sleep fatigue common symptom FM OSA may suggest related pathophysiology co-morbidity yet diagnose . This prospective randomized control clinical trial enroll adult FM patient screen positive OSA STOP-Bang questionnaire . OSA confirm laboratory polysomnography ( PSG ) study . After undergo baseline questionnaire investigation , patient confirm FM moderate severe OSA randomize one two different treatment : 1 ) Treatment FM Chronic Pain Clinic together Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) device OSA OR 2 ) Control group receive treatment FM Chronic Pain Clinic .</brief_summary>
