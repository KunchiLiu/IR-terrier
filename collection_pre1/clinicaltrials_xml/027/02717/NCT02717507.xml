	<brief_summary>This randomized phase IIb trial study well low-dose carvedilol work prevent heart failure cancer survivor expose high dose anthracyclines management childhood cancer . Patients receive high-dose anthracycline chemotherapy much great risk develop heart failure compare survivor n't get anthracycline chemotherapy . Heart failure happen heart muscle weaken ca n't pump blood well . Carvedilol may help low risk cardiovascular complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine impact two-year course low-dose carvedilol surrogate echocardiographic index heart failure ( HF ) risk , include : Left ventricular ( LV ) posterior wall thickness-dimension ratio ( LV T-D ) ; LV systolic diastolic function , afterload ; Natriuretic peptide , troponins , galectin-3 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety tolerability two-year course low-dose carvedilol , assess objective measure ( hepatic function ) patient report outcomes . II . To examine modify effect demographic , clinical , molecular characteristic risk : benefit ratio two-year carvedilol intervention . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate long-term efficacy carvedilol prevent cardiomyopathy and/or heart failure high-risk childhood cancer survivor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive low-dose carvedilol orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) 24 month . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD BID 24 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
