	<brief_title>Swiss PACK-CXL Multicenter Trial Treatment Infectious Keratitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research relevant study In 2008 , new concept take transfusion medicine transfer ophthalmology : reduction pathogen load platelet concentrate achieve treatment concentrate riboflavin ( Vit B2 chromophore UV-A light ) . In analogy , research group Zurich , Switzerland , show application could also apply human corneal infection . The proof-of-principle study include 5 cornea therapy-resistant conventional type treatment . In five case , corneal infection calm within day week eye could save . In year , effect riboflavin/UV-A irradiation show several bacteria fungi vitro , kill rate almost 98 % within 30 minute common strain responsible bacterial keratitis like Methicillin resistant Staph aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa . A case series clinical phase 1 study perform Makdoumi et al show beneficial effect PACK-CXL ( photoactivated chromophore treatment infectious keratitis-corneal collagen crosslinking ) 15 eye 15 patient early onset corneal ulcer . Here , PACK-CXL even use primary therapy , whereas control receive maximal conventional therapy ( medication ) . Again , PACKCXL alone beneficial outcome eye investigate . Between 2010 2013 , randomize prospective clinical trial perform examine effect adjuvant PACK-CXL therapy advance corneal ulcer associate melt . Even far advanced case impend perforation , additional effect PACK-CXL significant , drop ulcer-related complication rate 23 % ( control ) 0 % . A number small report case series show effect PACK-CXL bacterial , also fungal infection . Study 's overall goal The overall goal study demonstrate PACK-CXL valuable adjuvant therapy , rather primary treatment modality use beginning corneal ulcer , stage infiltrate begin ulcer . Current standard care would rather play secondary , support role primary one . Importance study global eye health . The economic socioeconomic cost related corneal ulcer medical treatment immense . For example , treatment fungal ulcer might cost several thousand US Dollars . PACK-CXL , contrast , require ( expensive ) medication , rather Vitamin B2 solution light source . Also , vitro vivo data show PACK-CXL highly efficient antibiotic-resistant infection MRSA . Furthermore , PACK-CXL base CXL , well-established technique use corneal disease . Rationale A Riboflavin solution administer cornea form eye drop patient . After administration 25 minute ( one drop every 2 minute ) , cornea irradiated UV-A light wavelength 365nm total energy 5.4 J/cm2 ( use 30 min @ 3 mW/cm2 , 10 min @ 9 mw/cm2 , 5 min @ 18mW/cm2 ) . These setting identical standard CXL setting routinely use clinical practice worldwide . The safety setting verify multiple experimental clinical study past 15 year . Our hypothesis PACK-CXL might highly beneficial treatment corneal infection patient , adjuvant therapy advance case , also primary mode treatment early case . In study , patient examine treatment closer control range customary condition . The treatment clinical use strong theoretical support . Patients run increase risk injury compare conventional treatment , check frequent normal thus , slight sign progress detect early . The investigator expect increase suffer treatment inferior healing compare usual treatment patient . The study offer possibility new tool treat difficult condition , need culture decrease reduces use antibiotic .</detailed_description>
