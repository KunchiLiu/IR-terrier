	<brief_summary>The objective propose study demonstrate serial blood volume analysis ( BVA ) use RI-BVA ( BVA-100 , Daxor , NY ) use guide change prescription dry weight hemodialysis patient . The knowledge patient 's ideal BV degree hypervolemia use measurement use change prescription DW objective way instead current standard practice , base subjective prescription dry weight . A first study conduct determine rate plasma volume ( PV ) re-expansion patient guide rate fluid removal ( result publish , refer citation ) . A second study conduct order ass value BVA measurement guide prescription clinical DW . A follow BVA would do order check patient closer ideal BV prior change dry weight .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In first study investigator demonstrate BV measurement use BVA-100 useful determine absolute BV well change BV correlate reasonably well CLM-III measurement . Individual refill ability determine well . This may prove useful prescribe monitoring ultrafiltration rate , establishment optimal BV HD patient reduce morbidity mortality associate chronic HD . In current study investigator hypothesize BVA use long term evaluate adequacy current clinically estimate dry weight dialysis patient use titrate EDW order improve overall volume status decrease incidence blood volume misinterpretation . The investigator enrol 12 eligible patient . Participants underwent post-hemodialysis blood volume analysis ( BVA ) baseline measurement . Based Blood Volume ( BV ) status , prescribe estimate dry weight ( EDW ) adjust . After 3 6 month , participant underwent repeat BV measurement . The investigator compare second value first order judge whether improvement BV status occur dry weight prescription change , judge stability .</detailed_description>
