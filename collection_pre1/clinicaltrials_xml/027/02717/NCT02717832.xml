	<detailed_description>SCREENING PROCEDURES Participants undergo battery initial screening test include : detailed health history physical examination , physical activity questionnaire , body composition assessment . All woman undergo urine pregnancy test . GENERAL STUDY DESIGN To avoid potential confound hormonal effect , woman study early follicular phase menstrual cycle . Subjects advise eat 3 day lead hospital visit maintain weight . Subjects also complete three day food journal hospital visit . The day prior study trial admission , subject need eat pre-prepared standardized meal breakfast , lunch , dinner even snack study team give . Subjects admit Michigan Clinical Research Unit ( MCRU ) morning 12-hour , overnight fast . After arrival , subject rest quietly room 30 minute . The study team measure subject rest metabolic rate 20 minute . After test , intravenous ( IV ) catheter place infusion second IV place vein opposite arm blood sampling . After IV placement , study team begin tracer-labeled glucose , `` sugar , '' infusion . The study team remove small sample muscle subject thigh . This muscle biopsy procedure involve numb nickel-sized portion skin thigh local anesthetic , make small incision ( 1/4 inch ) , remove small piece muscle ( approximately size 2-3 grain rice ) . The incision close piece sterile tape . The study team also obtain small sample fat tissue area underneath skin near belly button . This procedure involve numb small region skin near belly button local anesthetic , use needle small amount fat tissue remove underneath skin . During procedure subject feel pinch pulling , painful . The injury result muscle fat tissue biopsy rather minor . Subjects likely bruise mild soreness , prevent perform general daily activity . Approximately 2.5 hour admission , study team begin tracer-labeled fat infusion . The tracer-labeled fat study team infuse occur naturally body . By inject slightly great amount substance already body study team able measure rate fat breakdown fat burning . After 50 minute infusion , three blood sample obtain 5 min interval . After , study team begin hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure ( procedure measure body 's sensitivity insulin ) . During procedure study team infuse insulin glucose IV collect blood sample every 5 minute duration procedure monitor subject blood glucose blood insulin concentration . This procedure design last 2 hour . The study team change infusion rate glucose accordingly ensure subject blood sugar maintain healthy/normal level . The study team also infuse small amount potassium make sure potassium concentration remain healthy/normal level . About 30 minute start procedure measure body 's sensitivity insulin , study team collect another sample muscle thigh fat tissue area underneath skin near belly button . After complete hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure , subject provide meal , study team continue monitor subject blood glucose concentration stable . When subject vital sign stable , study team also measure percent body fat use Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) intra-abdominal fat Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . When DEXA scan MRI test complete , subject discharge hospital . Depending scheduling , however , DEXA scan MRI test may perform separate occasion study trial admission .</detailed_description>
