	<brief_summary>This study characterise role inflammatory process depression . There compel evidence inflammation often associate , cause , depression . It currently less clear antiinflammatory drug meaningful antidepressant effect . One goal identify subset depressed patient likely respond good antiinflammatory drug conventional antidepressant . The investigator therefore undertake study patient diagnosis major depressive disorder include four group : ) incompletely responsive patient demonstrated failure respond consistently completely standard treatment , ii ) respond well treatment currently depress , iii ) untreated patient currently depress , iv ) healthy volunteer history depression . Participants undergo clinical assessment , interview train member research team complete self-rated questionnaire . Investigators collect blood saliva sample measure certain immune marker . They also perform magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan look MRI marker brain investigate brain inflammation subsample patient use positron emission topography ( PET ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sampling ( also call lumbar puncture ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis ( ) therapeutic resistance monoaminergic ( MA ) antidepressant drug associate peripheral biomarkers indicate abnormal activation innate immune system余 ( ii ) peripheral inflammation , define blood level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , associated central nervous system inflammation abnormal brain structure function . The objective test two hypothesis collect clinical , immunological neuroimaging data patient depression ( DEP+ ) recruit network clinical research site United Kingdom . Primary objective : To measure peripheral immunophenotypes healthy volunteer ( least N=50 ) 3 group depress patient , categorised exposure therapeutic response monoaminergic antidepressant ( N=200 ) : - Incompletely responsive patient ( approximately N ~100 ) currently depress great 6 week treatment one monoaminergic antidepressant ( DEP+MA+ ) 余 - Responsive patient ( approximately N~50 ) currently depress great 6 week treatment monoaminergic antidepressant ( DEP-MA+ ) 余 - Untreated patient ( approximately N~50 ) currently depress treat monoaminergic antidepressant previous 6 week ( DEP+MA- ) 余 - Healthy volunteer ( approximately N~50 ) personal history depression require treatment either monoaminergic antidepressant clinical intervention include psychotherapy ( DEP-MA- ) . Secondary objective : To measure brain cognitive phenotype subsample N=100 depress patient recruit , preferably primary cohort , basis CRP level : - Low CRP patient ( N~45 ) CRP &lt; = 3 mg/L - High CRP patient ( N~45 ) CRP &gt; 3 mg/L - Healthy volunteer ( least N=45 ) . All subject sample assessed use structural functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) subject provide additional specific consent also assess use positron emission tomography ( PET-MR ) , and/or lumbar puncture ( LP ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sampling .</detailed_description>
