	<brief_title>Six Minutes Walk Test Shuttle Walk Test Eisenmenger Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It see increase number individual congenital heart diseases mainly due development new diagnostic technique , assessment treatment , thereby contribute long survival . These individual survive adulthood , many sometimes develop secondary problem underlie pathology , one Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension . The Syndrome Eisenmenger advance form pulmonary hypertension secondary congenital heart defect . It known patient pulmonary hypertension secondary congenital heart disease mark functional limitation high risk death . Among various form assess exercise capacity , Walk Test Six Minutes ( 6MWT ) , Shuttle walk test Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test among applicable . Little studied patient pulmonary hypertension secondary congenital heart disease Eisenmenger Syndrome . The characterization profile patient effort become necessary useful determine strategy identification factor may limit functional capacity quality life . Objectives : To verify applicability Six minute walk test Shuttle walk test assess functional capacity patient Eisenmenger Syndrome . Methods : Cross-sectional study patient diagnose Eisenmenger Syndrome , sex , without change pace low limb , perform echocardiography last 6 month clinical stability . Patients undergo three functional test , six-minute walk test , shuttle walk test cardiopulmonary exercise test cycle ergometer , associate evaluation metabolic ventilatory variable cardiac monitor throughout test . Also hold assess respiratory endurance strength , peripheral muscle strength manual pinch , Heart rate variability , inflammatory mediator blood lactate , besides questionnaire quality life , quality sleep daytime drowsiness .</detailed_description>
