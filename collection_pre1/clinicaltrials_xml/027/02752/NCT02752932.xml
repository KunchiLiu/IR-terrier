Evaluate feasibility rapidly accrue 30 participant recurrent metastatic head neck squamous cell carcinoma development patient derive xenographs ( PDX ) fresh , real time biopsy sensitivity &lt; 4 Ontario fund chemotherapeutic regimen test . Written feedback primary oncologist provide . 2 . There also curative intent cohort 30 participant undergoing surgical resection curative intent . These PDX model undergo exome sequence write feedback . 3 .

	<detailed_description>Tumour sample 30 participant HNSCC undergone curative surgery use establish patient-derived xenograft ( PDXs ) . These tumour also undergo exome sequencing . This provide biobank PDX model available genomic information future research project . Another 30 participant recurrent metastatic HNSCC ( RMHNSCC ) recruit study . PDX model develop patient tumour , follow genomic sequencing . PDX model develop transplant small tumour piece immunocompromised mouse . These mouse treat different available drug RMHNSCC discretion medical oncologist . These mouse follow examine tumour response treatment . When studied clinic , PDX model show high correlation patient response treatment . The PDX drug test result provide treat medical oncologist guide care oncologists discretion . Investigators ' hope improve chemotherapy response observe strategy .</detailed_description>
