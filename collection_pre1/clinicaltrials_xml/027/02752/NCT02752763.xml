	<brief_summary>Dry eye significant adverse effect isotretinoin cause patient use ophthalmic medication . For reason , many patient use isotretinoin referred ophthalmology clinic discomfort symptom . In literature , study suggest superiority Autologous serum drop regard effect ocular surface compare artificial tear . In addition , Autologous serum also use several corneal pathology successful outcomes . No data regard use ocular adverse effect isotretinoin found literature ; however , investigator think may effective alternative treatment dry eye develop isotretinoin use due positive effect ocular surface , epithelial regeneration anti-inflammatory effect . Autologous serum choice ophthalmologist routine practice increase number comprehensive study investigate effectiveness , safety long-terms effect Autologous serum therapy.In study , aim investigate dry eye development patient receive systemic retinoic acid therapy compare effectiveness Autologous serum Preservative free artificial tear patient dry eye disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Autologous Serum Versus Preservative Free Artificial Tear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , cross-sectional , double blind study conduct Ophthalmology Clinic patient drye eye due systemic isotretinoin treatment several reason Niğde State Hospital October , 2015 March 2016 . Patients determine drye eye systemic isotretinoin treatment include study . At baseline , 1.and 2. month study , detail ocular examination , best correct visual acuity measurement , intraocular pressure measurement , Tear Break-Up time ( TBUT ) ( 5 µL fluorescein sodium 2 % eye drop use per measurement use pipette standardization , mean value two reading per patient record ) Schirmer Test I ( ST I ) without topical anesthesia perform . Effect daily life assess use Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) score . TBUT &lt; 10 second , ST I &lt; 10 mm without local anesthesia , corneal conjunctival stain interpret favor dry eye . In follow-up period , investigator investigate efficacy autologous serum eye drop patient dry eye illness isotretinoin treatment . After informed consent , peripheral venous blood ( 14-20 ml ) drawn antecubital vein patient prepare AS . Blood sample leave room temperature 2 hour clot . Serum obtain centrifugation 4000 revolution per minute ( rpm ) 10 minute 4 °C use centrifugal device ( Nuve NF1200R ) . Next , laminar flow cabinet sterile condition , approximately 10 mL supernatant collect diluted 40 % isotonic ( 0.9 % NaCl ) saline solution 25 mL preparation aliquoted 1.5-mL Eppendorf vial , wrap aluminum foil specialist ( Erkut Küçük ) protection ultraviolet light ( prevent vitamin A degradation ) , blind patient treatment . PFAT eye drop also place different 1.5-ml Eppendorf vial likewise wrap aluminum foil specialist ( Erkut Küçük ) blinding patient . The dropper also wrap aluminum foil blind patient apply eye drop . Patients randomise via assign laterality number seal regime envelope specialist ( Erkut Küçük ) . Preservative-free isotonic saline use washout 2 week prior begin study . After first treatment period ( 1 month ) patient underwent 2-week washout period isotonic saline ( 0.9 % NaCl ) eye drop . Ten new set vial ( AS PFAT ) assign patient specialist ( Erkut Küçük ) second treatment period . After first 1-month treatment period , patient conventional PFAT treatment switch AS treatment patient AS treatment first 1-month treatment period switch conventional PFAT treat- ment second 1-month treatment period , accord study 's crossover nature . The examine ophthalmologist ( Uğur Yılmaz ) perform tear function ocular surface evaluation blind type eye drop give patient . In addition , patient blind treatment receiving . Only Other specialist ( Erkut Küçük ) , responsible patient evaluation , know patient receive treatment study period . All patient instruct keep vial ( contain either AS PFAT ) refrigerator 4 °C . All patient advise change vial every day treatment period . TBUT ST I administer ophthalmologist ( Uğur Yılmaz ) . The study approve Institutional Review Board Erciyes University , Medicine School . The study conduct accordance Helsinki Declaration . All patient give write informed consent .</detailed_description>
