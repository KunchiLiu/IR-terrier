	<brief_summary>The aim study describe safety antibody response revaccination MenACYW conjugate vaccine person receive first quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine dose ≥ 10 year age . Primary Objective : - To demonstrate non-inferiority vaccine seroresponse meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W follow administration booster dose MenACYW conjugate vaccine compare observe follow administration booster dose license Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine ( MCV4 ) subject first vaccinate 1 dose MCV4 , 4 10 year booster dose . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate vaccine seroresponse meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W measure use human serum bactericidal assay ( hSBA ) serum specimen collect 6 day vaccination subset subject - To evaluate antibody response ( geometric mean titer ) serogroups A , C , Y , W measure use hSBA Day 0 ( pre-vaccination ) Day 30 vaccination Observational Objectives : - To describe antibody titer meningococcal serogroups A , C , Y , W measure hSBA assess Day 0 , Day 6 , Day 30 day vaccination - To describe safety profile MenACYW conjugate vaccine compare license MCV4 booster vaccination .</brief_summary>
