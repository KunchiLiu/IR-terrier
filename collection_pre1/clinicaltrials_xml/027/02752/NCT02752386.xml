	<brief_title>Biofeedback Training Control Pain Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relaxation low-cost treatment manage pain little side effect . The propose study use novel biofeedback procedure try enhance ability relaxation engage pain inhibition . Specifically , biofeedback system use provide train condition pain regulation . The biofeedback system monitor trainee 's level sympathetic arousal use control intensity painful stimulation deliver trainee biofeedback . So trainee successfully relaxes ( reduce arousal ) , intensity lower produce pain relief . Efficacy train test randomize control trial healthy , pain-free trainee assign receive 3 training session 3 session control procedure ( 2 procedure serve control ; 3 group total ) . The aim ass whether train result inhibition experimental pain nociceptive flexion reflex ( NFR , physiological marker spinal pain signal ) determine whether brain-to-spinal cord inhibitory circuit engage .</detailed_description>
