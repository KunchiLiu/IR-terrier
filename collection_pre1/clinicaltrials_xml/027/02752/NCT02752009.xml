	<detailed_description>- This research study Pilot Study , first time investigator examine study intervention locally ; although intervention study nationally publish clinical trial . - In research study , investigator study accuracy sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure breast cancer patient cancer cell lymph node armpit ( axilla ) receive chemotherapy endocrine therapy prior surgery ( neoadjuvant therapy ) . - A sentinel lymph node biopsy surgical evaluation lymph node underarm area patient early breast cancer . Approximately , two-five node remove underarm area evaluation . The sentinel lymph node biopsy perform patient breast cancer determine cancer cell lymph node armpit . - The sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure perform inject one two dye breast , travel armpit region via small vessel immune system . These node call sentinel lymph node . They represent first node drain breast tissue . They closely evaluate Pathologist determine cancer cell present . - This information allow physician know far cancer may spread recommend therapy accordingly . - If sentinel lymph node biopsy determine accurate patient know already cancer cell axillary lymph node receive neoadjuvant therapy , future , many patient population may spar procedure full axillary lymph node dissection , remove large number lymph node thus increase risk side-effects .</detailed_description>
