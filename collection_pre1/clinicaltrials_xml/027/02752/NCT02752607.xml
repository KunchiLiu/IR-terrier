	<brief_summary>Background : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , include deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , third common cardiovascular disorder myocardial infarction stroke . VTE occur 1 person per 1,000 per year , increase dramatically patient cancer 25 per 1,000 per year . Among known risk factor VTE , cancer one potent . Patients cancer 7- 28-fold high risk VTE non-cancer patient . VTE important implication care cancer patient , include reduced life expectancy , high rate VTE recurrence stop anticoagulation , need chronic anticoagulation related adverse drug reaction , delay cancer therapy . Clinical dilemma : Current clinical guideline recommend minimum 3-6 month anticoagulation weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) cancer patient VTE . However , recommendation beyond initial 6 month therapy due lack data extend duration therapy cancer-associated thrombosis ( CAT ) . This lead variability physician practice , continue weight-adjusted LMWH therapy beyond 6 month . This pose concern , goal prevent recurrence VTE , risk major bleed prolonged weight-adjusted LMWH therapy significant . Potential solution : There lack data inform VTE treatment cancer patient beyond initial 3-6 month anticoagulation . We propose minimum 3-6 month therapeutic dose anticoagulation , use prophylactic dos LMWH acceptable adherence profile cancer patient VTE . The data obtain study help inform physician practice . Design : This multicentre , open-label study enoxaparin ( 40 mg subcutaneous injection , daily ) additional 6 month initial minimum 3-6-month course therapeutic dose anticoagulant therapy . Patients : 150 patient VTE secondary cancer take part multicentre study conduct 8 Canadian centre within Quebec , Ontario Nova Scotia . Study Outcomes : The primary objective study determine rate recurrent VTE patient receive prophylactic dose enoxaparin secondary VTE prophylaxis initial minimum 3-6 month anticoagulation . The secondary objective determine safety profile prophylaxis dose enoxaparin secondary VTE prophylaxis initial 3-6 month anticoagulation . This include determine subject : 1 ) cumulative incidence major bleed event ; 2 ) cumulative incidence clinically relevant non-major bleeding event ; 3 ) cumulative incidence minor bleeding event , 4 ) overall survival follow-up .</brief_summary>
