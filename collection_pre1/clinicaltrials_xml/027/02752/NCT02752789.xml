	<brief_summary>This multi-center , prospective , single cohort , observational study pediatric heart transplant recipient design determine impact preform versus de novo human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) donor-specific antibody ( DSA ) , antibodies self-antigens cardiac myosin vimentin , chronic allograft function . In addition , investigator explore mechanisms action predictor DSA , rejection alter pathophysiology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants enrol CTOTC-04 study ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01005316 ) invite enroll CTOTC-09 study . Conversion CTOTC-04 CTOTC-09 study occur manner avoid/minimize discontinuity follow-up plan CTOTC-04 CTOTC-09 study visit . In addition , subject add United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) system-or Canadian equivalent agency-at participate study site , less 21 year age fulfill study eligibility criterion , invite enroll CTOTC-09 . This study focus importance antibody newly transplant heart pediatric heart transplant recipient . The investigator aim determine certain antibody lead problem heart transplant . Antibodies small protein blood body make fight infection , example bacteria virus . Since new heart `` foreign '' recipient 's body , immune system might try attack antibody , infection . For many year think white blood cell attack new heart , cause rejection . Now new information show antibody may also cause rejection long-term damage heart . At time , little known antibody might cause problem heart transplantation transplant recipient young 21 year time transplant . This study collect medical history blood sample specify time research . The blood sample use measure antibodies blood , perform special test see antibody might damage heart . Participant follow-up day heart transplant year 5 post-transplant .</detailed_description>
