	<brief_summary>This single-arm open-label multi-cohort Phase II study evaluate safety/tolerability clinical activity combination nab-paclitaxel antibody program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) , pembrolizumab , patient human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER-2 ) negative metastatic breast cancer ( n=50 ) . There two cohort patient consist triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) cohort 30 subject hormone receptor ( HR ) -positive cohort 20 subject . There initial safety run-in 12 subject TNBC HR-positive cohort ( ~ 6 patient cohort ) . If unexpected toxicity observe ( define study protocol ) , enrollment continue complete cohort ( 30 total TNBC , 20 total HR positive cohort ) . The subject run safety part include Phase II analysis . Tumor expression program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) require enrollment study , assess possible predictive marker .</brief_summary>

TNBC define : ER/PR &lt; 1 % HER2 negative disease ( IHC 01+ 2+ HER2/17 ratio FISH ≤1.8 ) accord ASCO/CAP guidelines11,67 . HR positive define : ER/PR &gt; = 1 % HER2 negative per ASCO/CAP guideline . Have receive 02 line cytotoxic chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer endocrine therapy and/or target therapy allow . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial Be 18 year age day sign informed consent . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement PI designee . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . Be willing undergo tissue biopsy mandatory per protocol patient biopsy accessible disease . Must &lt; /= Grade 1 preexist peripheral neuropathy ( per CTCAE ) . Demonstrate adequate organ function define screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . This apply even subject practice true abstinence* heterosexual contact . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . A female subject childbearing potential sexually mature woman ( 1 ) undergone hysterectomy [ surgical removal uterus ] bilateral oophorectomy [ surgical removal ovary ] ( 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month [ i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ] . The female subject must : either commit true abstinence* heterosexual contact ( must review monthly basis ) , agree use , able comply , effective contraception without interruption ( 2 method birth control ) , 28 day prior start IP therapy ( include dose interruption ) , study medication longer period require local regulation follow last dose IP . Male subject must practice true abstinence* agree use condom sexual contact pregnant female female childbearing potential start first dose study therapy , dose interruption , 6 month follow last dose study therapy , even undergone successful vasectomy . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Taxane therapy within past 3 month ( 90 day ) prior study Day 1 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require treatment within last five year . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has know history of/active pneumonitis require treatment steroid history of/active interstitial lung disease . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator .
