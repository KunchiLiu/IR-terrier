On average , combination pharmacological psychological treatment achieves well result either treatment alone . However , apparently superior result combination treatment may due fact different individual preferentially respond pharmacological psychological treatment . The invesitagtors discover several clinical factor biomarkers predict poor response commonly use antidepressant medication : history childhood maltreatment , loss interest reduce activity , biomarker systemic inflammation , genetic marker sensitivity environment . Indirect evidence suggest factor may indicate need psychological treatment , usefulness differential predictor psychological pharmacological treatment outcome remain establish . The investigator test hypothesis pre-determined set clinical variable ( history childhood maltreatment , loss interest reduce activity ) biomarkers ( serum C-reactive protein , marker systemic inflammation , short allele serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism ) differentially predict response antidepressant cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy clinically significant accuracy .

	<detailed_description>Depression among common burdensome disease worldwide Canada . It treatable effective pharmacological psychological treatment , few 50 % individual achieve remission first treatment . The unsatisfactory outcome least partly due gap evidence treatment benefit individual . The two commonly use treatment modality depression antidepressant medication psychotherapy . However , minority individual depression achieve remission type treatment . On average , combination antidepressant psychotherapy achieves well result either alone , use two treatment time may wasteful unnecessary . Several line evidence suggest apparently superior result combination may due individual preferentially respond antidepressant others psychological treatment . These finding point possibility may possible improve outcome depression match psychological pharmacological treatment individual likely benefit one . The investigator propose close gap use combination clinical predictor biomarkers optimize choice psychological pharmacological treatment . The investigator identify symptom profile prominent reduction interest activity , history maltreatment childhood , increase systemic inflammation , genetic variant increase sensitivity environment predict poor response antidepressant medication . Indirect evidence suggest factor may predict good response cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy . The investigator focus four predictor substantial prior evidence : Reduced interest activity . A symptom dimension interest activity emerge strong predictor poor outcome antidepressant medication treatment . This prediction replicate undiminished effect size large study antidepressant treatment carry date,4 additional independent replication confirm robustness . Cognitive behavioural therapy improve activity interest well antidepressant medication . Childhood maltreatment . A meta-analysis establish history maltreatment childhood predict non-response antidepressant psychotherapy adult depression . History maltreatment may actually predict great benefit psychological treatment . Systemic inflammation . Inflammation may pathogenic mechanism proportion depression case . The invesigators find increase C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , marker systemic inflammation , predict non-response commonly use antidepressant . Cognitive behavioural therapy decrease CRP may prefer treatment option individual high level systemic inflammation . Genetic sensitivity environment . A functional polymorphism serotonin transporter gene make individual sensitive positive negative effect environment . This gene encode molecular target commonly use antidepressant polymorphism confers sensitivity environment also predict non-response antidepressant . A hypothesis genetic sensitivity environment may extend effect psychotherapy propose supported preliminary data . Combination predictor . The predictor least partly independent may combine clinically significant prediction treatment outcome . Reports gene-environment interaction suggest combination environmental genetic factor may add unique value . Therefore , investigator propose evaluate predictive validity pre-determined combination four factor predict differential outcome psychological pharmacological treatment . Other predictor . The selection four predictor describe represent balance comprehensiveness complexity , exhaustive . To maximize potential integrative analysis , investigator also evaluate addition potential predictor include anxiety , dysfunctional attitude , personality disorder . The investigator propose test whether four predictor combination differentially predict outcome cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy antidepressant medication clinically significant accuracy . If hypothesis support , result predictor allow personalized selection treatment depression , lead improve outcome healthcare efficiency . Additional objective include replication additional predictor integrative analysis aim refine treatment choice algorithm . Depression reclassify two category : major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , persistent depressive disorder ( PDD ) , may associate distinct etiology treatment response . The investigator include individual MDD PDD provide result generalize condition keep option explore separately . Objective : The invesitagtors ' primary objective establish whether predictive score base pre-determined set clinical variable biomarkers differentially predict response antidepressant medication cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy clinically significant effect size . Secondary objective include test predictor separately , test gene-environment interaction serotonin transporter polymorphism childhood maltreatment , integrative analysis use multiple predictor derive optimize prediction algorithm . Primary hypothesis : A score reflect loss interest activity , history childhood maltreatment , systemic inflammation genetic sensitivity environment predict good response cognitive-behavioural therapy relative antidepressant medication among adult major depressive disorder persistent depressive disorder . If hypothesis support , result predictor allow personalized selection treatment depression , lead improve outcome healthcare efficiency .</detailed_description>
