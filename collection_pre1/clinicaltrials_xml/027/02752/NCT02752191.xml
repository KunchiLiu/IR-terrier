	<brief_summary>The standard clinical cardiovascular MRI practice child CHD frequently involve use gadolinium-based contrast agent ( GBCA ) enhance tissue contrast . Most GBCAs small molecule quickly cross capillary wall access interstitial space , process diminishes signal contrast blood vessel surround tissue . Therefore , type GBCA useful first-pass MR angiography , wherein image acquire quickly initial 15-30 second post-injection GBCA concentration much high artery interstitial space . For young child complex CHD , stringent requirement high spatial resolution , need cardiac gate good blood-myocardium contrast order provide detailed evaluation intracardiac structure compatible conventional GBCA-based first-pass MR angiography . Even Ablavar® ( gadofosveset trisodium ) , FDA approve GBCA long intravascular half-life GBCAs , cardiac-gated Ablavar®-enhanced MRI may insufficient young child CHD base institutional experience data literature ; remain diminished blood-tissue contrast high-resolution cardiac-gated MRI . Furthermore , safety concern regard gadolinium deposition brain tissue repeat GBCA exposure well concern nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) associate GBCA injection young child &lt; 2 year old may immature renal function . The long-term health consequence effect pediatric population unclear . For reason , seek study diagnostic imaging effectiveness Feraheme ( Feraheme® ) , FDA-approved drug parenteral iron supplementation , MRI contrast agent child CHD . Although Feraheme® approve treatment iron deficiency anemia secondary renal disease , Feraheme® use off-label MRI contrast agent select medical center .</brief_summary>
