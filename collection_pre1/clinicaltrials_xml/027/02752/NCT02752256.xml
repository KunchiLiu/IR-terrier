	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effect air ambulance transport patient present ischemic stroke receive tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) . Primary outcome evaluation air ambulance transfer lead protocol violation significant delay therapy . Protocol violation include inaccurate dose preparation outside hospital , uncontrolled blood pressure flight , unnecessary medication administration flight adverse event ( intracranial bleeding , allergic reaction ) associate transfer process . Additional evaluation include effect vibration air ambulance effect lytic activity rtPA . rtPA suppose significantly agitate prepared solution significant vibration agitation air ambulance transfer .</detailed_description>
