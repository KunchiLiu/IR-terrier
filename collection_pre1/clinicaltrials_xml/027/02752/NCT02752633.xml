	<brief_title>Effect Allopurinol Febuxostat Urinary 2,8-Dihydroxyadenine Excretion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory pilot study open-label , crossover , single-center non-randomized clinical trial design compare effect standardly employ dos allopurinol ( 400 mg/day ) febuxostat ( 80 mg/day ) urinary DHA excretion patient APRT deficiency . The study conduct May 2013 May 2015 participant enrol different time . The study site Landspitali - The National University Hospital Iceland Reykjavik , Iceland . The Data ( Observational ) Safety Monitoring Board ( D/OSMB ) constitute National Institutes Health oversight responsibility Data Safety Monitoring Plan clinical trial . The monitor board review accrual , patterns frequency adverse event , protocol compliance every 6-12 month . All study subject give write informed consent participation . Study participant recruit group patient confirm APRT deficiency enrol National Institutes Health support APRT Deficiency Registry Rare Kidney Stone Consortium ( RKSC , http : //www.rarekidneystones.org/ ) . Confirmation APRT deficiency base upon determination know biallelic pathogenic APRT mutation absent APRT enzyme activity . Participants eligible inclusion ) currently receive allopurinol therapy ( currently recommend treatment patient APRT deficiency ) ; b ) willing interrupt allopurinol treatment total 3 week outline c ) least 18 year age . There exclusion criterion inclusion criterion meet . Study intervention After 7-day washout period , consent subject prescribe 400 mg allopurinol single daily dose 14 day . After second 7-day washout period , subject prescribe 80 mg febuxostat single daily dose another 14 day . Twenty-four hour first morning urine sample collect end first washout period , end allopurinol febuxostat treatment period , respectively ( day 7 , 21 42 ) . To minimize potential adverse effect dietary purine intake result , participant ask keep food record collect first 24 hr urine sample adhere diet collect two 24 hr urine sample . No measure take control dietary purine intake study period . At end study , patient advise return regular allopurinol dose regimen . Measurements Urinary DHA measure use rapid robust ultra high power liquid chromatography - electrospray tandem mass spectrometry ( UPLC-MS/MS ) ) , recently develop group . The 24-hour urinary DHA excretion ( mg/24-hours ) measure urinary DHA-to-creatinine ratio ( mg/mmol ) first morning urine sample calculate . Urine serum creatinine concentration measure isotope dilution mass spectrometry ( IDMS ) standardize laboratory method . Outcome measure The primary trial endpoint 24 hr urinary DHA excretion patient take two study drug , allopurinol ( daily dose 400 mg ) febuxostat ( daily dose 80 mg ) , evaluate conclusion 14 day drug treatment period . Statistical Analysis Data present urinary DHA excretion ( mg/day ) time collection urinary DHA-to-creatinine ratio first morning urine sample . Data whole group present median ( range ) . Differences median urinary DHA excretion urinary DHA-to-creatinine ratio , pharmacotherapy two study drug , febuxostat allopurinol , compare pair t-test .</detailed_description>
