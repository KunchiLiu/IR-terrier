	<brief_summary>Early detection treatment onset worsen breast cancer-related lymphedema ( BCRL ) potentially prevent postpone condition progress chronic progressive condition eliminate risk infection arm ( cellulitis ) . Self-surveillance BCRL routinely measure arm circumference could potentially enable early detection onset worsen lymphedema . The aim determine whether woman receive surgery breast cancer , perform self-measures arm circumference reliable valid manner use write video support instruction without in-person teaching physiotherapist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability Validity Self-measured Arm Circumference Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : test reliability validity self-measured arm circumference compare measure perform specialized therapist perometer ( gold standard ) . The hypothesis excellent correlation arm circumference measure perform participant experienced physiotherapist moderate correlation arm circumference measure perform patient determine perometer , well arm volume calculate arm circumference measurement measure perometer . Design : A cross-sectional study woman risk breast cancer-related lymphedema ( BCRL ) ( n=20 ) BCRL ( n=20 ) Procedures : Participants complete one self-assessment home one self-assessment laboratory University British Columbia ( UBC ) . Home Self-assessment : Participants send study package mail , contain consent form , tape measure , write instruction supplement illustration , link video guide , measurement form , along opaque envelop measurement form . Participants ask first review write video material outline measurement process , prior complete short self-assessment quiz self-measurement technique . Participants perform arm circumference measure arm per instruction , record measurement provide form seal form provide envelope . The envelope return study team lab assessment . Lab Self-assessment : At visit UBC , participant ask study staff repeat arm circumference measure support video write instruction , unsupervised physiotherapist . This follow assessment physiotherapist measure perometer . Statistical analysis plan : Intra-rater ( self-measures perform home lab ) , inter-rater reliability ( self-measures perform lab therapist-measures ) concurrent validity analysis ( self-measures perform lab perometer measure ) conduct separately woman without BCRL .</detailed_description>
