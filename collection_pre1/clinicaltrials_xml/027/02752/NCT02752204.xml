	<brief_summary>The aim clinical trial see drug call AZD2014 effective safe use treat patient relapse refractory Diffuse Large BCell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The trial also look combine antibody ( Rituximab ) drug AZD2014 small number patient see do without increase toxicity . 36 patient recruited trial . 30 receive AZD2014 alone remain 6 receive AZD2014 plus rituximab . AZD2014 give 125mg tablet take twice day 2 day every 7 ( i.e . day 1 2 every week ) . Rituximab give via IV infusion day 1 every 28 day ( every 4 week ) maximum 6 cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation AZD2014 Alone Combination With Rituximab Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single arm , multicentre , phase II clinical trial utilise two stage design . Stage one assess safety activity AZD2014 single agent treatment DLBCL 30 patient . Stage two assess additional toxicity combine AZD2014 Rituximab additional 6 patient . Stage two recruit follow full recruitment stage 1 . Stage 2 recruitment stagger 3 patient recruit safety data evaluate prior recruitment remain 3 patient . Post treatment biopsy request relapse patient receive rituximab assess evidence synergy . Once registered study , patient receive AZD2014 125mg bd intermittent schedule 2 day treatment follow 5 day treatment . Treatment would day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 23 course 28 day duration . Treatment on-going progression withdrawal due toxicity patient 's choice . For second stage trial , rituximab 375mg/m2 also administer intravenously day 1 28 day cycle total 6 cycle combination AZD2014 . All patient follow minimum 1 year disease progression death . For patient still AZD2014 treatment 1 year ( progression ) treatment still review least 3 monthly . Safety , progression survival data collect every 3 month . Assessments per local practice CT scan conduct every 3/4 month . At progression , patient follow annually survival data . Tissue , saliva blood sample collect treatment determine activity AZD2014 downstream target , correlate response . This include biopsy tissue pre-treatment sample , biopsy perform treatment relapse post-AZD2014 occur</detailed_description>
