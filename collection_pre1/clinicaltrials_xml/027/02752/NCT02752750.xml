	<detailed_description>Abnormally increase brain iron accumulation deep gray matter common find Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) amyloid protein precursor tau protein link disrupt iron homeostasis . Validation study show brain iron measure precisely novel magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique quantitative susceptibility mapping ( QSM ) vivo , thus , enable reliable precise longitudinal investigation . It hypothesize pathologic brain iron accumulation assess high sensitivity QSM current MRI technique R2* relaxation rate map regional QSM predictor cognitive decline disability . This explorative longitudinal study include 50 patient AD age-matched control subject recruit 2 year follow-ups undergo extensive cognitive test quantitative 3 Tesla MRI . Regional difference susceptibility R2* deep gray matter neocortex evaluate AD patient control related patients´ cognitive status baseline . Follow-up MRI clinical data multivariate regression analysis serve investigate dynamic AD-related change susceptibility , relation cognitive functioning . In conclusion , explorative longitudinal study patient cohort aim clarify whether regional QSM change potential biomarkers AD progression .</detailed_description>
