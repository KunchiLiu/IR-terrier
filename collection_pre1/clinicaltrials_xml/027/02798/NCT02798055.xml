	<detailed_description>The existence use Patient Registries , represent one foundation progress medical science , study natural history disease well critically evaluate therapeutic method , collection analysis data large number hospital unit , essential . Furthermore , assessment effectiveness adequacy health service base long-term monitoring large group patient , assessment efficient function individual unit , possible availability information patient unit . Moreover , record health service distribution data prerequisite design future development . The led growth many national international patient log , disease specific treatment , operation contribute advancement medical science . Scleroderma Systemic Sclerosis ( SC ) chronic autoimmune disease connective tissue incidence 1 : 10000- 1 : 30000 . In Greece estimate approximately 2,500 patient . The disease usually affect woman age 40-60 year , incidence four woman one man . The pathogenesis disease unknown , main cause consider genetic environmental factor . Two critical complication disease , Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension , occur patient SC approximately 8-12 % patient , main cause death , digital ulcer occur 30-60 % patient painful sore finger . Digital ulcer , i.e . painful sores finger , consequence limit blood supply vessel see approximately 30-60 % patient scleroderma . The digital ulcer adversely affect quality life patient , even simple daily activity lead serious complication , amputation . The symptom scleroderma vary patient may typical disease , least early stage , make difficult diagnose . Two early symptom disturbance blood supply extremity color change skin finger , alternately pallor-cyanation-redness ( Raynaud phenomenon ) rigid edematous finger .</detailed_description>
