	<detailed_description>Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ( CTE ) neurodegenerative disease characterize distinct deposition phosphorylated tau ( p-tau ) neuron astrocytes pattern unique tauopathies , include Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Although neuropathological feature CTE become clarified recent year , clinical presentation CTE still well characterize . Diagnostic criterion recently publish lack validation . Neuroimaging fluid biomarkers develop diagnosis neurodegenerative disease use preliminary study individual high risk CTE , namely athletes history significant exposure repetitive head impact ( RHI ) , former football player boxer . There thus urgent need develop accurate method detect diagnose CTE life effective intervention prevention treatment develop . Moreover , though history RHI necessary risk factor CTE , alone sufficient . There need understand specific aspect RHI exposure place individual increase risk CTE examine potential genetic polymorphism modify risk . To address need , investigator conduct multidisciplinary , multicenter , longitudinal study former NFL varsity college football player ( without symptom ) , control group asymptomatic same-age men without history RHI exposure , traumatic brain injury military service . Subjects see 1 4 participate study sit Boston ; Las Vegas , ; New York ; Scottsdale/Phoenix . Subjects undergo baseline evaluation 3 year follow-up evaluation ( currently former college player complete follow-up evaluation ) . Each evaluation take place 3 day period consist follow procedures/tests : neurocognitive testing , determination functional independence , neuropsychiatric examination ( measure mood behavior ) , neurological assessment ( motor , headache , postural stability ) , neuroimaging ( include structural , diffusion , functional , biochemical , molecular imaging ) , lumbar puncture ( Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers ) , blood draw ( blood biomarkers DNA ) , saliva sample ( biomarkers ) .</detailed_description>

Must asymptomatic screen telephone . Former NFL Varsity Collegiate Football Players If meet inclusion criterion If history clinical stroke confirm neuroimaging If vision hearing impairment significant enough compromise neuropsychological test If unable undergo MRI/PET Scan If unable travel one 4 study site participate If provide name contact information eligible study partner If take blood thinner would make LP unsafe If agree study test procedure If unable consent study procedure Control Group Exclusion : If meet inclusion criterion If vision hearing impairment significant enough compromise neuropsychological test If unable undergo MRI/PET Scan If unable travel one 4 study site participate If provide name contact information eligible study partner If report cognitive concern dementia screen process If unable consent study procedure</criteria>
