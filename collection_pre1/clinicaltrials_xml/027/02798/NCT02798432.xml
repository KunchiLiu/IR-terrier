	<brief_summary>Early total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) implant system frequently use all-polyethylene cemented tibial component1 . Based finite-element analysis study report superior force distribution compare conventional all-polyethylene component , metal-backed tibial baseplates dominate TKA implant market since middle 1980's2 . These modular implant provide excellent long-term implant survivorship3 . As TKA become increasingly successful , young patient increasingly become eligible . Increasing life expectancy raise concern cement TKAs may withstand prolonged use , particularly young patients4 . Patients young 65 year project account 50 % patient undergo TKA 2016 50 % patient undergoing revision surgery 2011 . The number total knee revision United States expect increase 38,300 2005 268,200 20305 . Many author report excellent equivalent result cement cementless TKA6-8 . Despite encouraging report , major concern cementless TKA tibial component , , therefore , preference many surgeon still remain cement tibial component9,10 . The femoral component may suitable cementless fixation11-13 . However , best femoral method fixation still discuss . Currently , decision cement cement femoral component base surgeon 's preference14 . The current study design compare hybrid NexGen LPS ( Zimmer Inc , Warsaw , IN ) cement NexGen LPS . The purpose study establish whether hybrid NexGen LPS lead equally successful result cement TKA gold standard</brief_summary>
