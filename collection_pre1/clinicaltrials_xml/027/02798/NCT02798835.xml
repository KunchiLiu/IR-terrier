	<brief_title>A Trial Adductor Canal Block Total Knee Arthroplasty : Is There Difference Between Single Shot Techniques Versus Continuous Infusion ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose To determine whether single shot adductor canal nerve block intravenous dexamethasone non-inferior continuous adductor canal blockade , whether either superior single shot adductor canal nerve block alone . 2 . Hypotheses The use adductor canal nerve block intravenous dexamethasone inferior continuous adductor canal blockade opioid requirement post operatively . Secondary hypothesis adductor canal nerve block intravenous dexamethasone continuous adductor canal blockade superior adductor canal nerve block alone . 3 . Justification Total knee arthroplasty commonly perform operation North America , high propensity postoperative pain . Inadequate analgesia limit functional recovery lead delay hospital discharge , result poor mobility . Effective analgesia allow early mobilisation improve postoperative recovery , multimodal regime ideal method achieve . Currently multimodal regime provide patient , intraoperatively neuraxial technique ( spinal anaesthesia ) , along surgeon infiltrate local anaesthetic end operation , postoperatively use systemic opioids via patient control analgesia ( PCA ) . Opioids many side effect , include nausea vomiting , sedation , respiratory depression urinary retention . These lead delay ambulation recovery . Many centre incorporate peripheral nerve block part multimodal analgesic regime , continuous femoral nerve blockade commonly use analgesia . This decrease amount postoperative opioid use , downside cause quadriceps muscle weakness lead increase risk fall delay ambulation . For reason , increase use adductor canal block , nerve block distal femoral nerve mid-thigh level , show preserve quadriceps function much good femoral nerve block , whilst still ensure decrease opioid use . To date , study compare single shot adductor canal block continuous adductor canal blockade , show comparable femoral nerve blockade , whilst decrease likelihood quadriceps muscle weakness . Further , show addition dexamethasone , administer via intravenous perineural route peripheral nerve blockade , prolongs duration analgesia . Perineural administration dexamethasone label use also theoretic risk neurotoxicity dexamethasone . Findings date indicate efficacy dexamethasone administer intravenously non-inferior perineural injection . Both route prolong analgesic benefit peripheral nerve block similar reduction opioid requirement . As state , currently Vancouver Coastal Health , opioid PCA commonly use modality postoperative analgesia follow total knee arthroplasty . The information study enable ascertainment best method allow patient good functional recovery , whilst minimise opioid side effect . 4 . Objectives The primary aim study compare efficacy adductor canal nerve block , without intravenous dexamethasone , continuous adductor canal blockade catheter ascertain cumulative opioid consumption post-operatively . The secondary aim compare quality anaesthesia recovery use QoR-40 questionnaire administer 48 hour postoperatively , length hospital stay , complication nerve blockade , incidence catheter dislodgement opioid side effect different technique . 5 . Research Methods Trial Design This randomised , non-blinded control trial , involve patient primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty . Setting This single-centre trial UBC Hospital ( UBCH ) . B. Randomisation Prior surgery , consent patient , seal unmarked opaque envelope open determine modality analgesia patient receive . The patient either receive adductor canal block postoperatively , adductor canal block postoperatively along intravenous dexamethasone , adductor canal catheter place postoperatively continuous adductor canal blockade . D. Data Collection Demographic data include patient age , sex , height , weight , BMI , medication include analgesic obtain patient . Comorbidities American Society Anaesthesia ( ASA ) score determine anaesthetic record . Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) pain score 0-10 well cumulative opioid consumption morphine equivalent determine set time point 12 , 24 , 48 hour . The data determine patient 's pain flow sheet medication administration record ( MAR ) , part standard chart find hospital ward . This charting also use ascertain side effect opioids , along anti-emetic medication administer . Time first mobilisation determine physiotherapy nursing record . At 48 hour , participant provide QoR-40 questionnaire , validate 40 item questionnaire quality recovery anaesthesia . The time discharge also record day follow surgery . Complications adductor canal catheter record , catheter dislodgement site infection . For patient unable complete study , reason note data include intention treat analysis . E. Statistical Analysis Sample Size The investigator currently previous data confirm standard deviation ( SD ) morphine equivalent consumption primary total knee arthroplasty . Based previous study , standard deviation morphine equivalent consumption 48h estimate 20mg non-inferiority limit 10mg . Using follow online calculator : http : //www.sealedenvelope.com/power/continuous-noninferior/ base power 80 % significance level 5 % , number patient require per group 50 . The aim recruit 60 patient per group account potential drop out . The intention reanalyze sample size 30 patient , thereby give good estimation SD , may affect power sample size . 6 . Data Analysis Categorical data analyse chi-squared test . Numeric variable compare independent T-tests distribution normal . If Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test normality distribution significant non-parametric Mann Whitney U test utilized . Statistical significance assume P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
