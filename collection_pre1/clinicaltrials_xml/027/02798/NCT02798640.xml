	<brief_title>Comparative Study Evaluating Performance Celliant Fibers Tissue Oxygenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adequate blood supply necessary many physiologic process . However , valid , reproducible , non-invasive method ass . One measure transcutaneous partial pressure oxygen ( tcPO2 ) . This measurement non-invasive method measure oxygen tension skin surface ; represent amount oxygen diffuse outward across skin ; use surrogate arterial perfusion . This method reproducible clinically acceptable intrasubject variability ; use variety condition , include peripheral vascular disease evaluation , predict outcome patient require amputation survival skin graft ; correlate well angiography increase blood flow rate . However , tcPO2 affect many variable , include oxygen concentration inspire air , lung function hemoglobin saturation , well local factor , skin thickness , sympathetic tone , presence inflammation , capillary formation skin oxygen consumption .</detailed_description>
