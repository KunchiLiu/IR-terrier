	<brief_summary>Milk source high-quality protein , calcium , vitamins mineral . Epidemiologic study link high consumption milk risk metabolic syndrome , T2DM , hypertension obesity , independent risk factor cardiovascular disease . However , milk contains disaccharide lactose , may cause gastrointestinal problem adult poor digestion . Recent study show subject intolerance lactose tend reduce consumption milk . Actually , consumption 12g lactose ( 240ml milk ) per day produce negligible symptom lactose intolerant . Furthermore , dairy-rich diet could improve lactose intolerance colonic adaption . Lactose maldigestion would restrict factor milk intake . In general , undigested lactose ferment colonic bacteria hydrogen , carbon dioxide , short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA : acetate , propionate , butyrate ) . The SCFAs may beneficial effect human glucose lipid metabolism , lactose fermentation may change intestinal flora profile . But study evaluate effect milk intake health people lactose malabsorption intolerance.This trial intend study effect whole milk cardio-metabolic risk factor healthy person without lactose maldigestion .</brief_summary>
