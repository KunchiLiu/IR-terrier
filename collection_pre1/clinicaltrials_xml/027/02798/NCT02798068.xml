	<detailed_description>Introduction Cardiac surgery associate variable severity organ dysfunction , lead increase ICU length stay ( ICU LOS ) even high mortality . Various mecanisms enter account , global regional hemodynamics microcirculation alteration . These due intense inflammatory reaction trigger contact blood cardiopulmonary bypass surface , contact blood - air cardiotomy aspiration , heparin heparin - protamin complex , ischemia - reperfusion mediator , toxin digestive tube . These alteration observe beat heart surgery surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CBP ) . The inflammatory response probably less important - pump surgery though hypothesis often questionned publication show change associate CBP could transient . Inflammatory response possibly reduce high - dose corticoid administration anesthesia induction - preserving cell membrane integrity , leucocyte adhesion cellular immunity attenuation , finally complement cytokine release reduction . Numerous metaanalyses show benefit strategy acceptable security profile : - Atrial fibrillation reduction - Possible ICU LOS reduction - Same incidence wound infection Within risk observe : - Higher incidence hyperglycemia - No impact overall mortality However , two recent big RCTs find benefit term morbidity-mortality , incidence wound infection possibly increase number reinterventions tamponnade . Providing low level evidence real benefit secondary effect , systematic use corticoid ( apply centre ) abandonned cardiac surgery centre . Nevertheless , corticoid could beneficial specific subgroup . In order identify patient , important understand mecanism microcirculation alteration set cardiac surgery CBP effect corticoid CBP induce inflammatory process . The alteration endothelial function CBP may observe three level : 1. endothelial reactivity ( vasodilation et vasoconstriction ) 2. blood flow ( acceleration et deceleration ) 3. glycocalyx ( endothelial protective layer ) These three component microcirculation tightly link . De Backer study sublingual microcirculation show alteration specific type surgery ( pronounced cardiac surgery CBP off-pump ) find minor surgery ( thyroidectomy ) . He also find positive correlation lactate level . Cardiac surgery consider interesting microcirculation endothelial function study model . The hypothesis investigator microcirculation modification along endothelial function cardiac surgery CBP due endothelial cell impairement impairement protective layer - glycocalyx , condition deregulates peripheral tissue reactivity hypoxia , corticoid could reduce alteration . The investigator study endothelial function three method : A/ FMD ( Flow Mediated vasoDilation ) non invasive technique consider gold standard endothelial reactivity evaluation since end 1990s . It base echographic measurement brachial artery diameter variation Doppler flow evaluation , episode transient ischemia induce pneumatic cuff inflation ( vascular occlusion test ) . Three study show reversible alteration endothelial function mainly cardiac surgery use CBP continuous blood flow ( FMD variation 11 % ) . Expecting reduction endothelial dysfunction corticoid 5 % , investigator analyze group 60 patient ( 30 corticoid group 30 placebo group ) . In previous study , variation already significative FMD varies 1,5 - 2 % . B/ NIRS ( near infrared spectroscopy ) - 's non invasive technique measure peripheral tissue oxygen saturation allow assess oxygen consumption microcirculation reactivity arterial occlusion test distally compressive cuff . Alterations variable derive delta StO2 ( peripheral tissue oxygen saturation ) ischemic - reperfusion event , rather absolute value StO2 predictive bad prognosis septic patient severe head injury . These variable delta StO2 , HbT ( total tissue hemoglobin ) THI ( muscular hemoglobin index ) . From element calculate others : RdecStO2 ( StO2 decrease rate ischemic event reflect tissue oxygen consumption ) RincStO2 ( increase rate StO2 reperfusion phase , correspond relative hyperemia ) . Both express % /s . The intensity reperfusion quantify delta THI . A recent study cardiac surgery show StO2 modification CBP provide small population sample type monitoring use , study might include methodologic biais . Finally , recently correlation FMD variation NIRS vascular occlusion test find young healthy subject , confirm influence endothelial function onto microcirculation . C/ Syndecan - 1 concentration assessment : This molecule closely link glycocalyx consider predictive marker integrity . Many factor might cause lesion structure ( inflammation , hyperglycemia , CBP , etc ) . Its destruction cause impairement endothelial function ( vasoconstriction et vasodilation ) , mediate principally endothelial factor . Corticoids consider effective molecule glycocalyx protection . Yet investigator analyze syndecan - 1 glycocalyx marker . Material method : After ethic commitee approbation sign informed consent obtention , investigator enroll 60 patient schedule cardiac surgery CBP ( aorto - coronary bypass graft valve replacement ) . Patients randomized Corticoids group receive 500mg methylprednisolone 100ml NaCl 0,9 % anesthesia induction , Placebo group receive 100ml NaCl 0,9 % - solution prepared hospital pharmacy pharmacist know preparation content ( double blinding ) . Exclusion criterion age 18 , extreme emergency surgery test would slow surgical treatment . The investigator also exclude patient placement pneumatic cuff would impossible ( amputation , AV fistula ) Anesthesia procedure : All patient receive anesthesia technique , base propofol remifentanil objective concentration . Relaxation achieve cisatracurium continuous infusion . This type anesthesia current practice Erasme hospital . All patient equip radial artery catheter central venous catheter , use pulmonary artery catheter leave anesthetist 's discretion . Before start CBP , patient receive heparin target ACT ( activate clotting time ) 480seconds . The prim CBP consist 500ml gelatin ( Geloplasma , Fresenius ) , 500ml cristaloids ( Plasmalyte , Baxter ) 200ml mannitol ( Mannitol 15 % , Baxter ) . Cardioplegy achieve blood infusion ( T 36Â° ) potassium chloride . The CBP flow continuous 2.4L/m2 mean arterial pressure maintened 60 90 mm Hg . Glycemia control strictly moment anesthesia induction short act insulin administrered continuously . All patient transfer ICU surgery , sedate propofol remifentanyl hemodynamic stability absence bleed achieve . Sedation stop patient extubated . Vascular occlusion test : Arterial diameter variation Doppler flow measure brachial artery medial epicondyl , proximally pneumatic cuff place forearm . For echography analysis , linear probe 12 MHz use , hold metallic support allow precision well reproducibility . After initial diameter measurement , pneumatic cuff 50 mmHg inflate arterial pressure patient 5minutes , order induce ischemia . Diameter variation brachial artery measure continuously 30 secondes release cuff 3 minute afterwards . FMD evaluate follow parameter : baseline diameter maximal FMD variation pourcents . In numerous study , FMD calculate use formula : FMD ( % ) = ( [ diametre maximal dilation cuff release - baseline diametre ] / baseline diametre ) x 100 . In order reduce variability measrure , diameter variation adjust baseline diameter initiate stimulus assess Doppler flow . Data stock analyzed Quipu FMD . StO2 measure tissular spectrometer ( Invos , Covidien ) consist photodetector , processor 15 mm optic probe . This proble placed thenar eminence arm without IV line . StO2 enregistered every 2 secondes . Practically , perform initial echographic measurement , 3 minute stabilisation StO2 ( baseline ) , ischemic event 5 minute create fast pneumatic cuff inflation value 50mmHg patient systemic blood pressure . This stop arterial venous blood flow forearm , lead decrease HbO2 ( = rate decrease StO2 ( % /s ) ) . After 5 minute cuff rapidly deflate ( &lt; 1seconds ) induce arterial diameter flow increase - variation assess echography Doppler . At time , StO2 increase ( = StO2 increase rate ( % /s ) ) achieve high value baseline ( = reactive hyperemia = delta diametre , flow velocity StO2 ) . The NIRS device measure also THi ( tissular hemoglobin index ) baseline 1 minute , minimum et maximum . The increase rate arterial diameter reflect endothelial reactivity StO2 increase rate consider tissue = hemoglobin flow marker . Reactive hyperemia interpret test microcirculation reactivity . Rate StO2 decrease/THi consider oxygen consumption marker . Syndecan-1 analysis perform frozen plasma ELISA technique , use specific antibody ( ELISA kit Ray Biotech , Inc ) , method already use previous study . Timing measurement : Measures perform day surgery , ICU admission , 24h day 7 hospital stay . Glycocalyx function assessment : The first analysis perform day surgery , anesthesia induction , ICU admission , 24h 48h .</detailed_description>
