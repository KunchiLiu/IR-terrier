	<detailed_description>Participants : For study , 16 adult male overweight obesity ( BMI-range 28 - 36 kg/m2 ) recruit randomize two experimental group ( high intensity training ( n=8 ) continuous moderate-intense aerobic training ( n=8 ) ) . Randomization do envelope method . Participants exclude diabetes ( HbA1c &gt; 6,5 % ) , severe musculoskeletal ( eg osteoarthritis ) , cardiovascular ( eg chronic heart failure ) respiratory ( eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ) problem , base medical file A sign informed consent provide participant study admission . The study approve ethic committee Ghent University Hospital ( B670201318620 ) . Intervention : The intervention group perform high intensity interval training [ HIIT ] . The HIIT group follow 10-week training program . The participant exercise 40 minute , twice week , supervision two physiotherapist . Each training session include warm [ stretch large muscle group cardiovascular exercise 30 % peak cycle power output five minute ] , sprint interval block [ 10 minute ] , continuous aerobic exercise [ 10 minute ] , another sprint interval block [ 10 minute ] cool [ stretch large muscle group cardiovascular exercise 30 % peak Watt 5 minute ] . For first 5 week , sprint interval block consist 10 sprint bout [ &gt; 100 r/min ] 15 second cycle resistance match ventilatory threshold [ VTR ] , alternate 45 second relative rest [ 50 r/min VTR ] . Starting week 6 week 10 , intensity sprint relative rest increase 110 % VTR . Comparative group : The comparative group perform continuous aerobic training [ CAT ] 10 week , twice week 40 minute per session [ volume frequency equal HIIT ] . The protocol CAT group consist warm [ stretch large muscle group cardiovascular exercise 30 % peak cycle power output five minute ] , continuous aerobic exercise training [ 3 time 10 minute ] cool [ stretch large muscle group cardiovascular exercise 30 % peak cycle power output five minute ] . During continuous aerobic protocol [ cycling step ] participant exercise 10 minute HR similar HR VT [ 60 r/min ] , increase 110 % VT week 6 onwards . The training supervise two physiotherapist . In exercise mode participant cycle first third block cycle stepped second block . The training program conduct Physiotherapy Department University Hospital Ghent . Outcome variable : The quantification examine variable perform blinded assessor . All test measurement conduct exercise laboratory Physiotherapy Department , Ghent University ( maximal exercise test , metabolic flexibility ) Department Endocrinology University Hospital Ghent ( OGTT muscle biopsy ) Department Pathological Anatomy ( muscle histology ) . Prior test measurement , participant well inform familiarize equipment test protocol . All participant group test moment day pre- post-intervention . All participant maintain normal physical activity dietary pattern , refrain exhaustive physical exercise three day prior experimental day Anthropometry Height measure near 0.1 cm use stadiometer ( Holtain Ltd , Pembrokeshire , UK ) . Weight measure near 0.1 kg digital balance scale ( Seca , Germany ) subject wear lightweight clothing shoe . The body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight height . Physical fitness Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test . Participants test computer-driven cyclo-ergometer ( Marquette Case , Marquette Electronics , Milwaukee , WI , USA ) use ramp protocol ( 20 W/ min ) start 40 W. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram heart rate ( HR ) record continuously test , whereas blood pressure measure manual sphygmomanometer every two minute . Subjects familiarized test procedure baseline test . Subjects ask encouraged perform exercise test physical exhaustion physician stop test severe adverse event , increase chest pain , dizziness , potentially life threaten arrhythmia , clinically important ST-segment deviation , mark systolic hypotension hypertension . Tests classify maximal respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) increase above1.1 . Respiratory gas measurement obtain use Metalyzer 3B ( Cortex , Leipzig , Germany ) . Oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production ( VCO2 ) , minute ventilation ( VE ) , tidal volume , respiratory rate mixed expiratory carbon dioxide concentration measure continuously mixed chamber analysis . Peak VO2 express high attained VO2 final 30 second exercise accord American Thoracic Society guideline . The ventilator threshold ( VT ) determine base metabolic equivalent O2 CO2 ( VE/VO2 VE/VCO2 ) . The point VE/VO2 increase without increase VE/VCO2 identify VT. Basal respiratory exchange ratio Participants lie supine 30 minute overnight fast quiet thermo-neutral environment . Basal oxygen consumption carbon dioxide production measure automated respiratory gas analyzer use mask ( Metalyzer 3B ; Cortex , Leipzig , Germany ) . The gas analyzer system calibrate every experiment . RER calculate VCO2/VO2 . This ratio lie interval 0,7 en 1,0 indicate dominant fat oxidation dominant carbohydrate oxidation . Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) At 8:00 A.M. , 10- 12-h overnight fast , subject receive 75-g OGTT . Blood sample take -30 , -15 , 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 min measurement plasma glucose insulin concentration . Insulin level determine use immunoanalyzer COBAS e411 ( Roche ) . Glucose analyse hexokinase method ( COBAS , Roche ) . To evaluate insulin sensitivity OGTT-composite score calculation base reference Matsudoa et al.. This score compose 10,000/square root ( fast glucose x fast insulin ) x ( mean glucose x mean insulin OGTT ) . The high score , good insulin sensitivity . Muscle biopsy After 1-h rest period , percutaneous needle biopsy sample take right vastus lateralis muscle biopsy gun ( needle 14G ) local anesthetic 2-mm incision skin ( 2-3 ml lidocaine ) guidance echography . Two muscle sample 15 mg take incubated PG ( Paraformaldehyde Glutaaraldehyde ) transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM use determine IMCL mitochondrial characteristic . Samples view 6,500× use JEOL 1200EX TEM . Sixteen micrographs acquire 8 randomly sample longitudinal section muscle fiber ( 2 micrographs/fiber ) individual muscle - one micrograph acquire near cell surface represent subsarcolemmal ( SS ) region acquire parallel bundle myofibril represent intramyofibrillar ( IMF ) region . Lipid droplets mitochondrial fragment circle convert actual size use calibration grid . For set 16 image , mean IMCL mitochondrial size ( µm2 ) , total number IMCL droplets mitochondrion per square micrometer tissue ( # /µm2 ) calculate IMF SS compartment digital imaging software ( Image Pro Plus , ver . 4.0 ; Media Cybernetics , Silver Springs , MD ) . The reference SS space quantification cytoplasmic space sarcolemma first layer myofibril . Statistical analysis All data analyse commercially available statistical software program ( Statistical Package Social Sciences , SPSS 20.0 , SPSS Chicago , IL , USA ) . Data express mean standard deviation ( SD ) . Due small sample size non-parametric statistical evaluation prefer . To evaluate pre-post difference within group , Wilcoxon test perform . To evaluate pre-post difference group , difference pre- post-evaluation calculate ( pre minus post ) compare Mann Withney U test . Significance level set P &lt; 0,05 test . For group difference effect size calculate base Cohen 's value .</detailed_description>
