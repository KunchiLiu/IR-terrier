	<brief_title>The Effect Functional Task Training Combined With Therapeutic Ultrasound Adults With Hip Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design The investigator propose randomize double blind control clinical trial . It would include two comparison group 25 participant medical diagnosis hip osteoarthritis classify severity II III inclusion criterion American College Rheumatology classification report osteoarthritis hip . All qualify participant attend pre-training ( baseline ) data collection session . During data collection session , participant complete Western Ontario MacMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) . All participant perform visual analog scale six minute walk test assess pain functionality , respectively . They assess hip muscle strength use manual muscle dynamometer . Their biomechanics gait assess use infrared motion capture system , force platform motion analysis software ( 120 Hz , BTS Smart DX100 , Italy ) . All participant group ask alter regular physical activity pain medication 15-sessions train program . Each participant assess pain , strength , gait biomechanics functionality 16 session intervention . Pain functionality evaluate session 5th 10th . The first group receive 16 session functional task train program therapeutic ultrasound versus second group receive 16 session functional task-training program . Functional task-training program include warm , follow functional circuit muscle strengthen exercise major group hip orient daily life activity end stretch . Therapeutic ultrasound apply prior functional task-training intensity 2.2 W/cm2 , frequency 1 MHz application time 4 minute . Temporal average intensity area correspond 0.44 W/cm2 , treatment area equal 2 time effective radiate area anterior , medial lateral hip area . The hypothesis study functional-task training program combine therapeutic ultrasound decrease pain , improve muscle hip strength gait biomechanics functionality people hip osteoarthritis . In statistical analysis result , difference assess three pain functionality assessment repeat measure use ANOVA ; difference initial final measurement strength , biomechanical gait variable functionality evaluate paired Student t-test Wilcoxon . The difference group assess t-test independent sample . Significant difference outcomes adjust covariates binomial regression , consider significance level p &lt; 0.05 . For patient registry : The Mederi Hospital integrate system collecting , store , monitoring , review , report registry data participant study . It also Manual documentation procedure registry , include protocol data collection instrument . The manual explain investigator create assign patient identification number duplicate record prevent report adverse event . The hospital take plan monitor audit screening practice trough audit department training educate data collector . Additionally , investigator make Pilot Testing ass understanding , acceptance feasibility patient registry process . In hand , staff involve data collection identify , role job describe data collection processing . All data collection register integrated system Mederi Hospital . The gait biomechanics data record first database Smart DX100 system Laboratory Biomechanics University Rosario . The investigator external research ( Fulbright Scholar ) audit register biomechanics data . Then , every participant study electronic medical record ( EMR ) health-related information . The Mederi Hospital system security plan include policy , standard operating procedure , administrative procedure , electronic signature also technical security support . The plan miss data variable report miss , unavailable , `` non-reported , '' uninterpretable , consider miss data inconsistency out-of-range result investigator quantify extent missingness , identify individual miss data assessment , investigator treat miss data across statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
