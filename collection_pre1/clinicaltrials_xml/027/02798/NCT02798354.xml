	<brief_summary>The proposal focus 3 specific , high-risk , pediatric ambulatory diagnostic error represent unique dimension diagnostic assessment : evaluation symptom , evaluation sign follow-up diagnostic test . Adolescent depression ( i.e . symptom ) affect nearly 10 % teenager , misdiagnosed almost 75 % adolescent cause significant morbidity . Pediatric elevate blood pressure ( sign ) misdiagnosed 74-87 % patient , often due inaccurate application blood pressure parameter change base age , gender height . Actionable pediatric laboratory value ( diagnostic test ) potentially delay 26 % time preliminary investigation 7-65 % adult , lead harm malpractice claim . The investigator propose conduct multisite , prospective , step wedge cluster randomize trial test quality improvement collaborative ( QIC ) intervention within American Academy Pediatrics ' Quality Improvement Innovation Networks ( QuIIN ) reduce incidence pediatric primary care diagnostic error . QuIIN national network 300 primary care practice , range tertiary care academic medical center single practitioner private practice , interested experience QICs . Because many process likely common across diagnostic error outpatient setting , multifaceted intervention , QIC , high likelihood success broad applicability across population . Preparatory inquiry QuIIN primary care provider suggest high interest reduce 3 diagnostic error provider agreement randomization evaluate diagnostic error intervention . Practices randomize one three group , group collect retrospective baseline data one error , intervene reduce error first eight month . Each group concurrently collect control data error intervene eight month . Following eight month , group continue intervene first error , begin intervene error control site , begin collect data third error control site . Finally , final eight month , group intervene three error . A second wave practice recruit join group eight month intervene two three error .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary â€¢ To determine whether QIC consist evidence-based best-practice methodology , mini-root cause analysis , data sharing , behavior change technique , associate reduction 3 specific diagnostic error rate national group pediatric primary care practice . - Hypothesis 1 : Implementation QIC lead 40 % reduction miss diagnosis adolescent depression . - Hypothesis 2 : Implementation QIC lead 30 % reduction miss diagnosis pediatric elevate blood pressure . - Hypothesis 3 : Implementation QIC lead 45 % reduction delay diagnosis actionable laboratory result . Secondary - To determine QIC 's effect change wave 1 versus wave 2 participant , second versus first error practice intervenes . - To investigate epidemiology three ambulatory pediatric diagnostic error : miss diagnosis adolescent depression , miss diagnosis pediatric elevate blood pressure , delay diagnosis actionable laboratory result . - To evaluate patient outcome related diagnosis include outcome positive depression screening , miss elevate blood pressure screen delay diagnosis actionable laboratory value .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The investigator include 30 primary care pediatric practice part American Academy Pediatrics ' QuIIN ( Quality Improvement Innovation Networks ) organization . The second wave recruit 15 additional practice . No practice exclude base race , ethnicity , gender location . Practices must sufficient volume adolescent well child visit ( 17 per month ) well child visit ( 30 per month ) , able query EHR system order include study</criteria>
