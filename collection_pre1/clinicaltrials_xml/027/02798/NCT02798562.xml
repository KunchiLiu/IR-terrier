	<brief_summary>The aim study clinical establishment native contrast-enhanced computer tomography breast . The early detection breast cancer still great challenge . Even though implementation digital mammography combine mandatory screening-programs lead significant improvement , sensitivity specificity examination need clearly classify improvable . Generally , state necessary transit 2-D projected image 3-D tomography crucially advantageous magnetic resonance image already show . Similar even major advantage expect new approach regard CT high local resolution , good 100µm 3D low dose , 5 Milligray ( mGy ) , demand screening . A device meet demand also applicable dynamic scan intravenous administration contrast agent , develop support European Union ( EU ) , German Research Foundation ( DFG ) Federal Ministry Education Research ( BMBF ) . Publications technical experimental result already available . An evaluation clinical use miss yet . The primary aim study evaluate systematically performance native dynamic , contrast-enhanced CT breast .</brief_summary>
