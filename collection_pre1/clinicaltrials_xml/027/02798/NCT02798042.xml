	<brief_title>Does Presence Preoperative Proteinuria Predict Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury Obese Patients Undergoing Elective Laparoscopic Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common , significant complication elective surgery associate increase risk mortality , major adverse cardiac event , prolong length hospital stay , increase cost per episode care . Obese patient increase risk postoperative AKI compare normal weight patient ; however current method assess preoperative renal function patient population ( measurement serum creatinine calculation estimate glomerular filtration rate ) previously demonstrate overestimate true renal function . , Preoperative proteinuria previously determine predictive development postoperative AKI patient weight undergo cardiac surgery . Published report prevalence proteinuria obese patient span wide range : 8- 43 % . The investigator aim determine predictive value preoperative proteinuria development postoperative AKI patient present elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery NYULMC . The investigator hypothesize preoperative proteinuria associate increase incidence AKI within 48 hour elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery . Furthermore , since wide range report prevalence proteinuria bariatric patient population , part value study provide definitive assessment prevalence proteinuria surgical population .</detailed_description>
