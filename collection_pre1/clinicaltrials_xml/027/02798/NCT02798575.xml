	<brief_summary>Detecting exacerbation prevent severe / early treat exacerbation crucial patient COPD order prevent hospitalization . Patients invasive mechanical ventilation outside hospital high re-hospitalization rate associate severe economic burden since patient need treat mainly ICU respiratory ward able take care invasive mechanical ventilation . Recently , show daily variation parameter record non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) software predictor exacerbation cohort COPD patient treat outside hospital NIV [ 1 ] . These parameter respiratory rate percentage respiratory cycle trigger patient . The aim present study detect parameter record ventilator able predict exacerbation / hospitalization patient COPD invasive mechanical ventilation outside hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number mechanically ventilated patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) increase due rise frequency respiratory cardiovascular disease well demographical change . As result , correspond increase time require complex process wean mechanical ventilation ( MV ) . Weaning MV contribute 50 % duration respiratory support . Especially patient prolong wean ( ≥3 spontaneous breathing trial ≥7 day ) refer complex patient group either chronic co-morbidities ( e.g . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] ) extend treatment ICU result acute condition ( e.g . septic cardiogenic shock , acute respiratory failure ) significant disease . Not patient wean ventilator . An increase number patient need invasive mechanical ventilation follow unsuccessful wean . They often need special care regard ventilatory support , management tracheal secretion muscular re-conditioning . These patient , especially COPD , high risk exacerbation thus high rate re-hospitalization . An early detection exacerbation rapidly implement therapeutic intervention major goal management patient severe COPD may need close contact medical expert . However , physician-based structure treat specific patient group exist , patient often hospital treatment . This might preventable clinical determinant ventilator parameter would detect timely . Home ventilator invasive ventilation provide built-in software record data respiratory rate ( RR ) , percentage respiratory cycle trigger patient ( % Trigg ) , tidal volume daily usage ventilator . A systematic assessment variation specific ventilator-based parameter may help predict risk exacerbation patient COPD treat home care . In sum , objective study ass whether day-to-day variation ventilatory parameter record ventilator predict imminent exacerbation need hospitalization patient COPD treat home invasive ventilation . This suppose major importance , progression disease economic reason regard health care system . The possibility detect exacerbation due ventilator analysis might step towards telemonitoring ventilator-dependent patient</detailed_description>
