	<detailed_description>Study design The present study would employ prospective questionnaire retrospective chart review develop centralized registry EVA patient information . The questionnaire would administer use custom-designed software internet web site use secure information transfer protocol encryption . Given authorization release Protected Health Information ( PHI ) , respective clinician would contact medical record would enter alongside correspond self-reported data . Interested researcher allow obtain data , give respective institution 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval documentation thereof . The study would initially continue four year , continue base enrollment number data request . Study procedure Collection method would choose participant , include one questionnaire and/or Authorization Release PHI relevant medical record retrieval . Implementation project would involve three separate component : participant data collection interaction , ( authorize ) PHI retrieval , data provision interested researcher . Questionnaire Data Collection Upon provide electronic signature , participant take page begin questionnaire . Patients begin questionnaire present web page ask history relate EVA . Please note web page offer option exit questionnaire . Patients elect provide Authorization Release PHI provide form print mail study center ( University Hospitals Case Medical Center ) . Clinical Data Retrieval Data Quality For participant provide Authorization Release PHI , clinicians whose information include authorization form contact information request . This process would involve transfer Authorization Release PHI one two way : either mail , via fax . Clinicians willing provide information instructed transmit , via fax mail , health data otolaryngology department University Hospitals . Health data receive review input form similar patient fill . Such mechanism provide redundancy data provide participant , thus ensure quality data . Providing Data Researchers The data collect cover range topic related EVA , hold aim provide subset data interested researcher IRB approval institution . A form website list field interested researcher complete , include upload IRB protocol . Interested researcher would also require complete Data Use Agreement . Informed consent procedure Consent obtain electronically store separately patient data , identifiable information link healthcare data use patient identification ( ID ) number . Potential participant elect visit EVAR website would present option participate EVAR . From , participant would direct informed consent web page contain information would write informed consent , blank version provide attached document . The web site would field participant type name date signify consent , another field participant ( applicable ) type name date signify assent . Completion field would consider equivalent write consent , refer document `` electronic signature '' . Only complete electronic consent would potential participant allow share questionnaire authorization information . This mean see questionnaire authorization release protect health information , participant would require provide electronic consent . The consent document would provide potential participant , form downloadable Portable Document Format ( PDF ) file separate html web page section consent may enter . This twofold approach ensure potential participant view consent web browser use html version , print PDF consent format accept University Hospitals IRB . Authorization Release PHI Procedure After provide electronic signature inform consent , participant opportunity complete Authorization Release PHI form . Please see attachment example form . Participants provide information necessary fill form would give option print form , receive form mail return postage . In either case , form would populate participant-provided data provide participant signature date would need complete form . For participant elect receive form mail , two copy would provide allow participant keep one . In either case , participant would ask sign date document mail Otolaryngology Department University Hospitals Case Medical Center ( UHCMC ) . Original document would copy , along copy , store locked cabinet normally lock office UHCMC campus . Data security Data transfer occur use secure internet protocol , use computer physically locate University Hospitals campus.Participant information maintain secure , HIPAA-compliant server locate University Hospitals campus . Only database developer study personnel access data . For patient provide Authorization release PHI , data receive via fax , mail , University Hospitals email , store secure University Hospitals server . Identifiable information protect improper use disclosure store data secure server locate University Hospitals campus . When submit data internet , participant connect directly University Hospitals server use secure http protocol data access anyone outside participant server . For patient provide Authorization release PHI , data receive via fax , mail , University Hospitals email . Identifiable information reuse disclose person entity outside University Hospitals identify protocol , except require law , authorize oversight research study , specifically approve use another study IRB . Any access website data review monthly basis . Statistical analysis sample size calculation Data wide variety patient experience measure unavailable determine effect size subsequent minimum sample size , particularly end-point likely high variability self-reported hearing loss . For reason , ensure great possible discrimination effect , EVA registry open many people willing enroll . Previously , mail list interested participant create , 53 people sign course three week . Sizes online special interest group ( Yahoo group , http : //health.groups.yahoo.com/group/LVAS ) 1000 3000 register user . Given mail list interest , online community size , investigator expect 300 participant enroll . Statistical method leave researcher request data , data organize facilitate descriptive model-based statistical characterization EVA population . Hearing loss progression may evaluate multiple dimension , particularly relation event head trauma fly . For example , category treatment ( head trauma , fly ) amenable analysis respect outcome ( hear loss progression ) test Chi-square test . Other researcher may interest understanding time take diagnose EVA , case interval date birth date first image study model respect available data point . Data element collect : Part 1 - Demographics : - Relationship respondent patient - Patient : - Date Birth - Gender - City - State - Guardian : - Date Birth - Gender - City - State - Contact : - Email - Phone Part 2 - Initial Findings - Age diagnosis hearing loss - Diagnostic method - Audiogram , Otoacoustic Emissions Testing , Auditory Brainstem Response , ? - Age first image study - First image type - Computed Tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) ? - Imaging result - Which ear EVA - Left , right , - Diameter vestibular aqueduct Part 3 - Progression - Has progression hear loss ? - Date age progression hearing loss diagnosis - also , command ? - Events contribute hearing loss , open text box - Did family notice hearing loss event - Was hear loss recognize coincidentally hear screen/routine audiogram ? - Was patient treat hearing loss ? - Check box treatment steroid Part 4 - Trauma Flying - Has patient document head trauma ? - Date age trauma - also , command ? - Was associate hearing loss ? - What additional testing perform , ? - Was additional imaging do ? - Has patient fly ? - Was subjective worsen hearing ? - Was additional testing require fly ? Part 5 - Family History - Is family history hearing loss ? - Is family history EVA ? - Has genetics test complete ? - If , type test ? - At age ? - What result ? - Does patient Pendred syndrome ? Part 6 - Aids - Does patient receive speech therapy ? - If , often ? - At age speech therapy begin ? - Does patient use Frequency Modulation ( FM ) system school ? - Does patient use hearing aid ? - If , ear ? - Starting year age ? - Does patient cochlear implant ? - If , ear ? - What year operation perform ? - If two implant , do time ? - At age operation perform ? - How long diagnosis hearing loss operation perform ? - How long diagnosis EVA operation perform ? Part 7 - Vertigo - Has patient ever balance problem vertigo ? - If , frequently ? - How severe ? - Are trigger activity ? - At age first episode ? - How long diagnosis vertigo occur ?</detailed_description>
