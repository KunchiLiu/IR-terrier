	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method choice breast cancer perform loco-regional stag direct treatment . European Guidelines ( EUSOMA ) currently recommend MRI initial evaluation assessement neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) response , breast cancer . The standard care consist realize MRI start NAC another one 's end , six month later . There currently consensus realization interval MRI early assessment chemosensitivity tumor . It would allow though alteration therapeutic regimen event non response . Similarly , consensus interval MRI perform . Some recent study suggest Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging interesting evaluation early response . However , preliminary study quantitative measure realize region interest ( ROI ) method . A response neoadjuvant chemotherapy result elevate value apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) . The investigator 's goal study evaluate reliability diffusion tumor biomarker . Therefore , study quantitative analysis diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance sequence pre-therapeutic assessment early late follow-up breast cancer neoadjuvant treatment ( chemotherapy , hormonotherapy ... ) within CHU Brugmann hospital . The result analysis compare MRI result obtain end treatment histology initial biopsy surgical specimen . The expected benefit : - establish correlation apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value histology - observe change ADC accord type response : ADC increase event partial response , ADC stability event non response , ADC decrease event progression , absence restriction event complete response . - confirm diffusion weight MRI within short interval ( one cure , one month ) predictive value neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) response .</brief_summary>
