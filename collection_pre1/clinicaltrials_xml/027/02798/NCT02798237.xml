	<brief_summary>Physical activity level important determinant quality life person post-stroke . There lack knowledge regard effect overground walk aerobic train physical activity level cardiorespiratory fitness post-stroke subject . Therefore , aim study compare effect aerobic overground training , aerobic treadmill train overground train improve physical activity level , cardiorespiratory fitness , endurance , mobility , quality life participation participant post-stroke . A randomized control trial blind assessment assign eligible participant either : 1 ) aerobic overground training , 2 ) aerobic treadmill training , 3 ) control group ( overground walk ) . Participants receive three 40 minute session per week 60-80 % heart rate reserve ( groups-1 2 ) , 40 % ( group-3 ) 12-weeks . At baseline , post-intervention , 4-week follow-up researcher blind group allocation collect follow outcome measure : physical activity level , cardiorespiratory fitness , endurance , mobility , quality life participation . We hypothesize two aerobic train group ( overground treadmill ) , would increase physical activity level cardiorespiratory fitness ( peak VO2 ) , well endurance , mobility , quality life participation . In addition , control group would improve outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sample size : cardiorespiratory fitness ( peak VO2 ) use primary outcome measure determine sample size derive aerobic treadmill train study Globas et al . post-stroke subject . In randomized controlled trial , experimental group ( n=18 ) show increase peak VO2 average 5.5 ± 4.6 mL/kg/min , control group ( n=18 ) average reduction 0.8 ± 7.8 mL/kg/min . Using α=0.05 β=0.80 , number 13 participant per group require . Assuming dropout rate 15 % , 45 participant ( 15 participant per group ) recruit . Statistical analysis : A code give participant . Two independent examiner perform data entry , verify miss apparently wrong value . Original paper form keep secure place . Electronic file available research team . An independent examiner , blind group allocation , perform statistical analysis SPSS ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , USA ) . Descriptive statistic test normality employ . Baseline variable compare group use One-way ANOVA . The effect training analyze collect data analysis intention-to-treat . Data last available assessment consider value session lose dropout . Between-groups difference measure two-way ANOVA ( α=0.05 ) repeat measure consider baseline , post-training follow-up . Study result spread regardless magnitude direction effect .</detailed_description>
