	<brief_summary>Background : LMB-100 man-made protein . It attract mesothelin protein . This find many tumor , include mesothelioma . But find small number normal tissue . After bind mesothelin tumor , LMB-100 attack kill cancer cell . Researchers want test LMB-100 people advance mesothelioma . Objective : To find safe dose anti-tumor activity LMB-100 people advance mesothelioma . Eligibility : Adults age 18 older : Advanced pleural peritoneal mesothelioma respond platinum-based therapy Adequate organ function Design : Participants screen : Samples tumor tissue tumor fluid . These new previous procedure . Medical history Physical exam Blood , urine , heart test Chest x-ray CT MRI scan FDG-PET scan Participants get LMB-100 day 1 , 3 , 5 21-day cycle . It give IV catheter , tube insert arm vein . They get standard medicine infusion help prevent side effect . Each infusion last 30 minute . They monitor 2 hour . During cycle , participant repeat screen test . Participants get study drug 4 cycle disease worsen intolerable side effect . About 4 6 week last infusion , participant follow-up visit . They repeat study test . Participants follow-up scan every 6 week disease get bad . Participants call year see .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Immunogenicity Mesothelin-Targeted Immunotoxin LMB-100 People With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Although mesothelioma patient limited tumor burden may benefit surgical resection , patient advance disease diagnosis candidate cytoreductive surgery . - For mesothelioma patient eligible curative surgery , median survival supportive care alone 6 month whereas current standard treatment , combination cisplatin pemetrexed , median survival 12 month . - Mesothelin , tumor differentiation antigen , express 95 % epitheloid mesothelioma . Mesothelin suitable candidate target therapy due limited expression normal human tissue high expression several tumor include mesothelioma . - LMB-100 novel recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin develop treatment patient solid tumor express mesothelin . Mesothelin target link humanized fragment anti-mesothelin Fab de-immunized Pseudomonas exotoxin ( PE ) . - The clinical use first generation immunotoxins SS1P hamper mainly high immunogenicity . LMB-100 next generation PE-fusion protein protein-engineered maximally reduce immunogenicity . LMB-100 show broad activity different mesothelinexpressing cancer cell line tumor xenograft model . Objectives : Phase 1 To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) LMB-100 patient treatment refractory advance epithelioid biphasic mesothelioma . -Phase 2 To determine efficacy LMB-100 respect objective response rate patient treatment refractory advance epithelioid biphasic mesothelioma . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year - Histologically confirm advanced pleural peritoneal mesothelioma - Subjects must least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen last dose previous therapy occur 3 week start study treatment - Adequate organ function - Participants CNS metastases prior pneumonectomy exclude Design : - This Phase I , open-label study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , activity LMB-100 patient treatment refractory advance epithelioid biphasic mesothelioma . - LMB-100 administer intravenously day 1 , 3 5 21 day cycle 4 cycle - Tumor response assess every 2 cycle - Optional tumor biopsy may collect baseline 2 cycle therapy - The accrual ceiling set 30</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ( All Cohorts ) : Histologically confirm epithelial biphasic mesothelioma amenable potentially curative surgical resection . However , patient biphasic tumor equal 50 % sarcomatoid component exclude . The diagnosis confirm Laboratory Pathology , CCR , NCI . Archival sample fresh biopsy tumor effusion must available confirmation diagnosis . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must least one prior chemotherapy regimen include pemetrexed cisplatin carboplatin . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . The last dose previous therapy must occur least 3 week prior start study therapy . Palliative radiotherapy allow 2 week first LMB100 infusion . Patients standard curable therapy exist Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use LMB100 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study All acute toxic effect prior radiotherapy , chemotherapy , surgical procedure must resolve Grade le equal 1 , except alopecia ( grade ) Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy . ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 or1 Adequate hematological function : neutrophil count equal 1.0 ( SqrRoot ) 10 ( 9 ) cells/microL , platelet count great equal 100,000/microl , hemoglobin equal 9 g/dL Adequate liver function : Bilirubin le equal 2.5 ( SqrRoot ) upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( exclude Gilbert Syndrome , see ) . Patients Gilbert syndrome eligible study . The diagnosis Gilbert 's syndrome suspect people persistent , slightly elevate level unconjugated bilirubin without apparent cause . A diagnosis Gilbert syndrome base exclusion disease base follow criterion : Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia note several occasion No evidence hemolysis ( normal hemoglobin , reticulocyte count , LDH ) Normal liver function test Absence disease associate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia Adequate renal function : creatinine clearance ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) great equal 50 mL/min . Must serum albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL without intravenous supplementation Must leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50 % Must ambulatory oxygen saturation &gt; 90 % room air The effect LMB100 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry 3 month last dose study therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( All Cohorts ) : Known clinically suspect CNS primary tumor metastases include leptomeningeal metastasis . History clinical evidence CNS metastases unless previously treat , asymptomatic , requirement steroid enzymeinducing anticonvulsant last 14 day . Evidence significant , uncontrolled concomitant disease could affect compliance protocol interpretation result , include significant pulmonary disease primary cancer , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , and/or significant cardiovascular disease ( New York Heart Association Class III IV cardiac disease , myocardial infarction within last 6 month , unstable arrhythmia , unstable angina , clinically significant pericardial effusion ) Active uncontrolled infection . HIV active HBV HCV infection . HIV positive patient exclude due theoretical concern degree immune suppression associate treatment may result progression HIV infection . Patients prior pneumonectomy Any disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition would contraindicate use investigational drug Major surgery significant traumatic injury great equal 28 day prior first LMB100 infusion ( exclude biopsy ) anticipation need major surgery study treatment Dementia alter mental status would prohibit informed consent Live attenuate vaccination 14 day prior treatment Pregnant woman exclude study unknown whether LMB100 potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother LMB100 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated LMB100 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Known hypersensitivity component LMB100 High dose systemic corticosteroid within 7 day prior first dosing . High dose consider &gt; 20 mg dexamethasone day ( equivalent ) &gt; 7 consecutive day . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( Cohort B ) Subjects must receive paclitaxel nabpaclitaxel within 4 month prior initiation study therapy . Participants contraindication and/or history sever hypersensitivity reaction nabpaclitaxel .</criteria>
