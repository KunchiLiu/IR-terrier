	<brief_summary>This study ascend dose first-time-in-human study determine safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) profile GSK1795091 healthy subject . The result support design future clinical trial GSK1795091 administer subject advanced malignancy combination immune system modulators . Part 1 randomized , double-blind ( sponsor-unblinded ) , placebo-controlled , single center , single dose escalation , sequential group evaluation intravenously administer GSK1795091 evaluate safety tolerability healthy subject . Part 2 open-label , parallel group evaluation 2 dos GSK1795091 administer , either 1 week apart ( Part 2 , Cohort 1 ) 2 week apart ( Part 2 , Cohort 2 ) . In Part 2 , Day 1 , subject receive intravenous GSK1795091 dose determine result Part 1 . The total duration study approximately 10 week screen last study visit .</brief_summary>
