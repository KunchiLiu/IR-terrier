	<brief_title>SGLT-2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin Effects Appetite Weight Regulation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out family six sodium glucose co-transporters , two extensively study therapeutic indication involve glucose reabsorption glomerular filtrate . Sodium glucose co-transporter-1 ( SGLT-1 ) , mainly find renal tubule enterocytes line intestinal villus , transfer glucose across concentration gradient result glucose absorption gut account 10 % glucose reabsorption renal tubule . Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 ( SGLT-2 ) , mostly find kidney , responsible reabsorb 90 % glucose filter renal tubule . Compared healthy individual , SGLT-2 over-expressed over-activated type 2 diabetes . SGLT-2 inhibitor new class glucose-lowering drug management type 2 diabetes reduce plasma glucose level increase urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) 60-80g ( 240-320 kilo Calories ) per day . SGLT-1 inhibitor combine SGLT-1 -2 inhibitor currently development . Several SGLT-2 inhibitor commercially available license use UK include dapagliflozin , canagliflozin Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) . They low glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) effectively compare placebo ( mean difference vs. placebo -0.66 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval , -0.73 % -0.58 % ) . They also result weight loss approximately 1.8kg compare placebo combination oral hypoglycaemic medication . Some weight loss attribute fluid loss due osmotic diuresis UGE . Weight lose subcutaneous visceral store adipose tissue . Phase II study show highly selective potent SGLT-2 inhibitor Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) result significant reduction HbA1c level 12 week therapy compare placebo ( HbA1c 0.4-0.6 % reduction 5-25mg daily dose , p &lt; 0.0001 ) reduction similar see metformin . Weight loss 1.81-2.33kg also achieve depend Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) dose along reduction fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) . Similar improvement HbA1c , weight FPG see phase III trial Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) monotherapy combination metformin , sulphonylureas insulin . Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) license UK use type 2 diabetes management . In study , use Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) accord licensed indication dosage . The common known side-effects include urinary tract genital mycotic infection frequent woman men generally mild severity . Dehydration postural hypotension may occur due volume depletion modest lower blood pressure . Increased urinary frequency may also occur . Increased risk hypoglycaemia observe Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) combine sulphonylureas insulin . Weight loss increase UGE net energy loss SGLT-2 inhibitor less expect show study patient type 2 diabetes . Endogenous glucose production markedly increase shift substrate utilisation carbohydrate lipid . Up 90g glucose excrete per day Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) equate 360 kilo Calories per day lose glycosuria . A 90 week study patient type 2 diabetes treat Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) 25mg daily show average weight loss 3.2±4.2kg represent calorie deficit 51 kilo Calories /day ( interquartile range 112 ) . This 29 % ±41 % expect loss 11.3±3.1kg predict glycosuria 206 kilo Calories per day use validated mathematical model ( http : //bwsimulator.niddk.nih.gov ) . An increase daily calorie intake 269 kilo Calories /day [ Inter Quartile Range 258 ] daily energy expenditure appear adaptive response due Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) therapy combination SGLT-2 inhibitor calorie restriction recommend author study . Appetite stimulation result increase energy intake may underlie mechanism weight loss deficit . Furthermore , glucagon response increase SGLT-2 inhibition use Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) dapagliflozin . Appetite hormone peptide Y-Y ( PYY ) ghrelin important control appetite weight regulation . They secrete intestinal L cell find distal small intestine . Ghrelin , stimulate hunger , show increase weight loss energy restriction diet . Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) another hormone involve regulation appetite satiety along glucose homeostatic effect . There study investigate impact SGLT-2 inhibitor appetite hormone effect body composition . It essential understand mechanism order maximize weight loss achievable agent . They may need combined appropriate dietary measure energy restriction diet weight-lowering weight-neutral hypoglycaemic therapy optimal clinical benefit . The aim study explore relationship appetite hormone Empagliflozin ( Jardiance™ ) order understand underlie mechanism observe weight loss equate predict agent .
