	<brief_summary>Primary objective project measure impact passive control active control system indoor pollution directly indirectly relate ambient air pollution ( smog ) . The first goal measure baseline parameter 50 home , include information building , ventilation characteristic , pollution level ( indoors outdoors ) , occupant survey information . In subset home , either passive active control system instal impact system indoor concentration . Participants enrol rolling basis ( 5-15 person study give point time ) 16-month period . Participants follow approximately 5 week data obtain three point time : enrollment ( day 1 study ) , 1 week ( baseline verification ) four week control system home ( end study week 5 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) degenerative lung disease result low lung function characterize obstruction airflow . COPD umbrella term two disease process : chronic bronchitis emphysema . It currently 4th lead cause death United States . Approximately 14 million Americans know suffer COPD ; however , estimate many 24 million Americans may form one disease ( Centers Disease Control , 2011 ) . The primary risk factor develop COPD cigarette smoking ; factor include exposure air pollution , occupational dust chemical , low socioeconomic status . Poverty identify risk factor COPD aspect related poverty increase risk COPD unclear ( GOLD , 2011 ) . Lower education level household income noted relate increase severity COPD ( Eisner , Blanc , Omachi , Yelin , Sidney , Katz , et al , 2011 ) . An American Lung Association survey find half diagnose COPD report condition limit ability perform activity daily live , include activity home ( American Lung Association , 2009 ) . As air pollution lead exacerbation COPD symptom precipitate emergency room visit hospitalization , minimize pollution indoor air may key component disease management decrease health care cost .</detailed_description>
