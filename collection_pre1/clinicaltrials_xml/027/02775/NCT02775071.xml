	<detailed_description>Psychosocial Status Psychopathology Candidates Bariatric Surgery : Extreme obesity associate signiﬁcant psychosocial burden , include impairment quality life , body image , sexual behavior area psychosocial functioning . While distress believe contribute decision bariatric surgery , impact postoperative outcomes less clear . At present , little known physiological behavioral contribution success failure bariatric surgery . Regardless , weight regain bariatric surgery frequently attribute preoperative psychosocial behavioral factor . More speciﬁcally , great deal interest presence formal psychopathology bariatric surgery patient potential contribution postoperative outcome . At least six study describe rate psychopathology candidate bariatric surgery use structure diagnostic instrument . Lifetime rate psychiatric diagnosis range 36.8 % -72.6 % , high report study general population . Mood disorder frequent diagnosis , see 22.0 % -54.8 % patient . Substance use disorder ( SUDs ) find 35.7 % patient alcohol abuse dependence 33.2 % . Binge eat disorder ( BED ) , deﬁned eat unusually large amount food within short period time coupled loss control eating , diagnose 4.6 % 27.1 % patient . Current diagnosis ( compare lifetime ) less common , report 20.9 % -55.5 % candidate surgery . Mood disorder diagnose 31.5 % . BED range 3.4 % -41.9 % . Current substance use see less 2 % patient . ( Note . The low percentage current psychopathology , oppose lifetime psychopathology , expect . ) While study psychosocial characteristic bariatric surgery candidate informative , without limitation . Many study suffer methodological concern , include small sample size lack appropriate comparison group . Further , establish psychiatric diagnosis prior bariatric surgery challenging . Perioperative guideline suggest patient undergo evaluation mental health professional prior surgery third party payer require evaluation . However , program use structured clinical interview establish diagnosis clinical purpose . Several study suggest candidate bariatric surgery engage impression management prior surgery , minimize report psychopathology present bariatric team favorable light . To address issue , assessment psychiatric symptom research purpose recommend occur independently require clinical evaluation , investigator propose study . Nevertheless , study focus relationship speciﬁc diagnose postoperative outcome may fail account psychological construct may share across diagnosis . Mood disorder , BED , SUDs share common psychological construct impulsivity , consider important aspect executive functioning . A lack impulse control may contribute excessive weight gain see extreme obesity may impact result bariatric surgery . Disinhibition Impulsivity among Persons Extreme Obesity ; Studies suggest individual obesity , particular extreme obesity present bariatric surgery , show deﬁcits executive functioning . For example , candidate bariatric surgery show deﬁcits work memory , mental ﬂexibility , motor speed complex attention.These deﬁcits could impact comprehension retention information present patient preoperative consultation process , thus , negatively impact ability adhere dietary behavioral change require optimal postoperative outcome . At time , metabolic dysregulation , insulin resistance hyperglycemeia see type 2 diabetes , also associate cognitive deﬁcits , suggest potential physiological mechanism relationship . Dietary disinhibition , deﬁned loss control eating , play central role overconsumption food , subsequently , development obesity . Disinhibition similar impulsivity , term commonly use substance use smoke cessation literature . Impulsivity multi-faceted construct refers absence ability inhibit automatic behavior ( otherwise know response inhibition ) tendency discount future consequence favor immediate outcome ( know delay discounting ) . Similar role disinhibition obesity , impulsivity contributes development relapse SUDs . Indeed , response inhibition delay discounting associate SUDs obesity . Both also predict response treatment SUDs obesity . Chronic overeat binge eat share several neurobiological behavioral similarity SUDs . In regard , may view behavioral disorder , intake ( food , alcohol , and/or drug ) escalate rate unhealthy maladaptive . Nevertheless , speciﬁc nature relationship binge eat substance use remain fully elucidate . There similarities binge eat addictive disorder , include crave desire substance ( drug highly palatable food ) , sense loss control use , repeat attempt control use despite clear adverse consequence , dedication much time obtain use substance . Thus , disinhibition observe obesity binge eating , impulsivity see substance use disorder , emotional dysregulation associate mood disorder likely share commonality may contribute development extreme obesity also may associate weight loss change psychosocial status bariatric surgery . Psychosocial Status Psychopathology Bariatric Surgery : In general , individual undergo bariatric surgery report dramatic improvement psychosocial status function postoperatively . The vast majority patient report signiﬁcant reduction symptom depression anxiety ﬁrst postoperative year . They also report signiﬁcant improvement health weight-related quality life . Patients also report improvement body image , sexual functioning , relationship satisfaction . The relationship preoperative psychopathology postoperative outcomes less robust . Livhits colleague review literature conclude preoperative factor BMI , BED , presence personality disorder provide strong negative association postoperative weight loss . At least two study suggest preoperative psychopathology , particularly mood anxiety disorder , associate small weight postoperative weight loss . The relationship BED postoperative weight loss unclear ; study find relationship preoperative BED postoperative weight loss others . Additionally , two study suggest history substance abuse associate large weight loss follow bariatric surgery . The interpretation counterintuitive ﬁnding self-regulation skill help patient maintain sobriety also help patient adhere demand recommended postoperative diet . Disinhibition Impulsivity follow Bariatric Surgery Encouragingly , study show improvement executive functioning person extreme obesity ﬁrst two year bariatric surgery . Postoperatively , patient typically report decrease disinhibition hunger , well increase cognitive restraint . The physical aspect bariatric surgery typically prevent individual eat objectively large amount food necessary meet diagnostic criterion BED . However , many individual continue report feeling loss control eating.The self-reported inability control impulses postoperatively associate small weight loss great emotional distress ﬁrst postoperative year . There additional evidence patient difﬁculty impulse control surgery . A number study suggest increase risk substance abuse follow bariatric surgery . King colleague , seminal investigation , find increase rate alcohol use disorder second postoperative year compare year prior surgery ﬁrst postoperative year . Other recent study also find increase alcohol composite substance abuse ( drug , alcohol , cigarette ) ﬁrst two year bariatric surgery . Postoperative substance use associate small postoperative weight loss , postoperative nocturnal eating , subjective hunger . Patients great risk new onset SUDs likely report problem high sugar/low fat food surgery , suggest role impulsivity eat behavior substance use surgery . This increase substance abuse surgery describe addiction transfer characterize modern example symptom substitution abuse one substance ( food ) replace another ( alcohol drug ) patient unable consume large amount food surgery . A potential contributor addiction transfer may emotional dysregulation . In general , symptoms depression typically improve within ﬁrst six month bariatric surgery patient period rapid weight loss . Within ﬁrst two postoperative year , use anti-depressant medication also decrease ; however , substantial minority patient report use medication two year surgery . As patient begin regain weight postoperatively , also experience erosion improvement depressive symptom quality life . In addition , higher-than-expected number postoperative suicide document . A secondary aim propose study investigate relationship change weight ﬁrst two postoperative year change psychosocial status . The propose observational study evaluate relationship measure psychopathology , disorder eating , impulsivity , ( assess preoperatively early postoperative period ) change weight psychosocial status first two year bariatric surgery . All participant complete assessment baseline ( surgery ) 6 , 12 , 24 month follow-up . Secondary aim examine psychopathology , disorder eating , impulsivity , well weight loss , relation change eat behavior , physical activity , psychosocial status , substance use first two year bariatric surgery . The study one specific aim two secondary aim .</detailed_description>
