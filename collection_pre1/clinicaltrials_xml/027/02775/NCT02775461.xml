	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish registry patient pancreatic disease . Patients include registry may include : pancreatic cancer , precancerous lesion pancreas , inflammatory lesion pancreas , cystic lesion pancreas , patient high-risk pancreatic cancer family history pancreatic cancer family history syndrome know associated pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause death cancer United States . However , little know development pancreatic cancer pancreatic disease individual condition . Knowledge family history , environmental exposure , inflammatory lesion pancreas contribute development pancreatic cancer pancreatic disease essential . You may qualify take part research study inflammation pancreas , pancreatic cyst , pre-cancerous lesion pancreas , pancreatic cancer , family history pancreatic cancer , family history syndrome know associated pancreatic cancer . We also collect blood sample participant DNA isolation . Sometimes born gene DNA give u increase decreased chance develop illness later life . Genetic material isolate blood study . You may also choose provide additional blood sample serum plasma extraction . Serum plasma component blood use measure indicator disease blood , call biomarkers , pancreatic disease . Clinical data biological specimen contain study may use wide variety future relate study cause , diagnosis , outcome treatment pancreatic cancer . Funds conduct research provide Mount Sinai .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall purpose research project establish registry patient pancreatic disease . Patients include registry may include : pancreatic cancer , precancerous lesion pancreas intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMNs ) cystic lesion , inflammatory lesion inflammation pancreas , patient high-risk pancreatic cancer family history pancreatic cancer family history syndrome know associated pancreatic cancer . The data contain registry use conduct research relate risk pancreatic cancer pancreatic disease . As registry protocol , specific hypothesis test . Specific Aims : 1 . Establish maintain registry individual family member pancreatic disease may increase risk develop pancreatic cancer normal population risk . 2 . Collect data review exist data personal family history , demographic , risk factor , health behavior . 3 . Use data registry conduct study relate disease risk , prevention , prognosis pancreatic cancer pancreatic disease . Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause death malignancy United States . With near equivalent incidence mortality , cure achieve surgical resection early stage lesion . Premalignant disease stage , IPMN , may detect noninvasive minimally invasive technique , provide opportunity screen surveillance at-risk population . Knowledge etiology pancreatic cancer incomplete . Approximately 10 % pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) hereditary component , screen population potential impact disease mortality . Certain patient population , hereditary pancreatitis , Peutz-Jeghers syndrome , familial atypical multiple mole melanoma ( FAMMM syndrome ) , Lynch syndrome , breast ovarian cancer syndrome ( BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation ) high risk PDAC . BRCA2 mutation commonly identify germline mutation family PDAC . Even family history PDAC without describe syndrome show increase risk , suggest unique familial pancreatic cancer syndrome may relate partner localizer BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) gene PDAC susceptibility gene . Environmental risk factor , cigarette smoking , diabetes , obesity dietary risk factor implicate development PDAC . A sequential model acquisition somatic mutation via Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( PanIN ) propose development PDAC subsequent metastasis . However , others propose metastatic process may initiate early disease process pre-malignant cyst PanIN phase . This may part account fact overwhelming majority patient diagnose PDAC diagnose lesion already metastatic . Several group institute PDAC screen individual high-risk PDAC . These group demonstrate feasibility detection PDAC pre-malignant lesion certain high-risk individual . Given large gap knowledge , recruitment patient preneoplastic pancreatic disease registries essential development effective PDAC screen prevention program . As increase number patient undergo cross-sectional image abdomen cat scan ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , increase number patient find pancreatic disease pancreatic cyst . While increase risk pancreatic cancer lesion , study date small retrospective .</detailed_description>
