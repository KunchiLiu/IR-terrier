	<brief_summary>This prospective randomize study involve 124 patient . All participates give write information 3D laparoscopy . They randomize accord computer-generated random sequence two group , 2D 3D group . The operation perform either use 2D 3D laparoscopy . Surgeons allow change type laparoscopy difficulty encounter . After operation , surgeon require fill questionnaire self-evaluating performance use Global rating scale component intraoperative assessment tool ( GOALS ) , discomfort encounter , need change laparoscopy preference type laparoscopy . The level complexity operation , duration operation , blood loss complication record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D Versus 2D Laparoscopic Ovarian Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopy greatly replace laparotomy gynaecological operation include oncological procedure . Laparoscopic approach mainstay ovarian cystectomy nowadays . However loss depth perception dexterity remain drawback laparoscopy . With development robotic surgery , three-dimension vision presence `` wrist '' motion allow surgeon perform complicate operation sophisticated manner . Expensive instrument need prolonged time setup restrict extensive use . Having consideration mind , three-dimension ( 3D ) laparoscopy another possible alternative . With advancement technology 3D vision , may provide good precision especially perception depth spatial orientation . Dizziness , nausea , headache ocular fatique occasional side effect 3D surgery create concern surgeon . There study use standardized task show 3D laparoscopy improve performance surgeon objectively subjectively especially perform complex task . It suggest able fasten learn curve beginner . The operation time short laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform use 3D image without major complication encounter . Yet evidence applicability use clinical service gynaecological operation still inadequate . The investigator would like evaluate difference 2D versus 3D laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy .</detailed_description>
