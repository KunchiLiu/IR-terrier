	<brief_summary>Bronchoscopy examination perform routinely pulmonology . This exam consider uncomfortable nearly 60 % patient , especially due respiratory block sensation , cough nausea cause , despite use local anesthetic . Conversely , examination rarely perform general anesthesia hospital France , lengthen duration procedure , increase cost dangerous respiratory failure patient . Hypnosis alter state consciousness wakefulness sleep , cause patient ignore reality focus attention imagination , reduce anxiety , painful unpleasant perception memorization . The hypnosis benefit already evaluate control pain anxiety many medical situation , surgical , obstetric dental . In endoscopy , result mixed . In bronchoscopy , hypnosis , knowledge , evaluate . In preliminary study endoscopy unit Hospital Saint Joseph , involve 66 patient , investigator show bronchoscopy poorly tolerate half patient poor tolerance correlate level anxiety patient , 75 % patient survey would prefer wan redo examination condition health require , rather use general anesthetic . Investigators hypothesize hypnosis would improve tolerance bronchoscopy local anesthesia , without need general anesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To compare safety bronchoscopy perform local anesthesia hypnosis perform local anesthesia alone . Secondary objective : - Self-assessment pain , difficulty breathing , cough sensation nausea experience patient . - Straight-tolerance assessment review endoscopist . - Evaluation quality implementation review endoscopist . - Evaluation amount local anesthetic use examination . - Measure length review . Development study : If eligibility criteria present , propose patient participate study assess tolerance Examination hypnosis . A fact sheet hand explain purpose study place examination . If agrees participate , consent obtain write randomize one two group . He fill questionnaire clinical information Anxiety Questionnaire HAD ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) . The examination conduct endoscopy room . In hypnosis group , patient benefit induction technique hypnosis doctor train hypnosis local anesthesia perform endoscopist . In control group , local anesthesia practice endoscopist . The waning , ask patient endoscopist complete evaluation tolerance examination questionnaire . Methodology : DESIGN : Number subject require : 126 The prevalence poor tolerance examination population 52 % ( numeric scale overall tolerance &gt; 3 ) expect objective intervention group hypnosis halve number patient EN &gt; 3 overall safety , number subject include 63 per group . Time study : baseline January 2015 expect period eight month depend pace inclusion estimate average 4 per week . Randomization : Randomization 2 group make day week carry hypnotherapist ( Monday Tuesday random alternation 2 day ) . The list day balance randomly alternate block . The team bronchoscopy prescribers bronchoscopy inform first schedule avoid selection bias patient . Acquisition data : - Gender , age - respiratory history - bronchial endoscopy antecedent - Admission Status ( external hospitalize ) - analgesic anxiolytic Processing - Anxiety Questionnaire HAD ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) - Pre-medication receive - vital parameter examination : heart rate , oxygen saturation - Way passage endoscope ( nose mouth ) - Time endoscopy ( input output endoscopy suite ) - Quantity Xylocaine use exam - Sampled - Score cough , pain overall tolerance digital scale review ( self-evaluation patient ) - Acceptance patient repeat examination condition health require future - Straight-evaluation physician endoscopist overall tolerance review patient ( digital scale ) - Easy complete review endoscopist ( digital scale ) - Summary potential adverse event Statistical analysis : To find test difference , univariate analyzes use test t-Student continuous variable chi 2 categorical variable nonparametric equivalent . The significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . 1.2 Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) A serious event event : - The evolution fatal ; - Which endanger life person undergoing research ; - Which cause disability significant lasting disability ; - Causing hospitalization prolongation hospitalization ; - Which result abnormality birth defect ; - Any event meet qualification list , regard `` potentially serious '' include laboratory abnormality ; - Medically relevant event judgment investigator ; - Events require medical intervention prevent progression one aforementioned state . The term `` life-threatening '' reserve immediate life-threatening time adverse event , regardless consequence corrective palliative therapy . Certain circumstance require hospitalization within gravity standard `` inpatient / hospitalization extension '' : admission social administrative reason ; hospitalization predefined protocol ; hospitalization medical surgical treatment schedule prior research ; pass day hospital . 2. detection method collection adverse event : All adverse event investigate , report record , process evaluate first visit ( inclusion Day 0 ) end study resolution . Adverse event collect : - In clinical , biological plan systematic examination investigator ; - By spontaneous reporting participant , instruct contact investigate doctor case adverse event . All adverse event record form adverse event case report form ( see Appendix 6 ) . Each observed adverse event record individually . The intensity adverse event determine follow : - Mild ( grade 1 ) : interference patient 's daily activity ; - Moderate ( grade 2 ) : Moderate interference patient 's daily activity still acceptable ; - Severe ( grade 3 ) significant interference patient 's daily activity unacceptable ; - Threat life-threatening ( grade 4 ) ; - Death ( Grade 5 ) . All adverse event must grade . Responsibilities investigator 2.1 Statement SAEs The investigator evaluate adverse event relation severity . The investigator must notify fax ( 01 44 12 32 52 ) sponsor ( CRC GHPSJ ) without delay day hear , serious adverse event trial , except identify protocol require immediate reporting . This initial notification subject write report must follow necessary one report ( ) Additional ( ) writing ( ) Main ( ) within 8 day first declaration . The investigator must document best event ( thanks copy laboratory result report examination hospitalization account inform serious event , include relevant negative result , forget make document anonymous register number patient 's code ) , medical diagnosis causal link serious adverse event research . The statement send developer serious adverse event report form sign date . The investigator follow patient SAE resolution , stabilization level deem acceptable investigator return previous state , even patient test inform promoter ( CRC GHPSJ ) fax : 01 44 12 32 52 use form ( check : monitoring ) . 2.2 Assessment causality The investigator assess causality adverse event research . The causal link binary ( connect / connect ) . 2.3 Reporting period follow term adverse event The investigator report serious adverse event inclusion patient end experimental procedure . The investigator monitor adverse event resolution stabilization even patient study . 2.4 Special Cases 2.4.1 Serious Events immediately declare To extent expect serious adverse event relate participation patient study certain serious adverse event know associate bronchoscopy ( hemoptysis , asthma , respiratory distress , allergic xylocaine etc . ) may occur , require immediate notification accordance health authority . 3 . Responsibilities promoter The Promoter declare ANSM CPP accordance law 9 August 2004 : - unexpected serious adverse reaction without delay late within seven calendar day day sponsor becomes aware , within 7 day monitoring , - development without delay safety late within 7 calendar day , within 7 day monitoring , - annual safety report within 60 calendar day anniversary date study . 4 . Appointment independent monitoring committee To extent expect serious adverse event relate participation patient study , Investigators want establish independent monitoring committee .</detailed_description>
