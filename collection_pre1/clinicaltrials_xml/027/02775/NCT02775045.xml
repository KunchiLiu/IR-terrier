	<brief_summary>The purpose study improve overall management patient Eosinophil Esophagitis . Currently , best way monitor Eosinophil Esophagitis repeat endoscopy procedure . The investigator plan identify biomarker blood ( measurable substance ) track disease activity reduce need follow-up endoscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>By definition , Eosinophil Esophagitis involve presence eosinophil esophageal mucosa . Although incompletely understood , pathophysiology Eosinophil Esophagitis think include food allergen drive inflammation esophageal mucosa trigger release mediator recruitment eosinophil . The mediator , eotaxin , invoke eosinophil activation traffic esophageal tissue . The subsequent release mediator eosinophils cell , include mast cell basophil , promote inflammation fibrosis result Eosinophil Esophagitis symptom . This protocol focus early eosinophil activation event Eosinophil Esophagitis peripheral circulation , specifically activation surface β1 integrin , biomarker disease activity reflect eosinophil destine traffic esophagus . Demonstrating correlation disease activity peripheral biomarker may ultimately facilitate timely , less invasive less costly management strategy Eosinophil Esophagitis .</detailed_description>
