	<brief_summary>This clinical research protocol determine feasibility assess lead level hunter use lead projectile . This study determine possible perform interventional double-blind placebo-controlled study lead level hunter use lead lead-free projectile follow consumption self-harvested wild game . The hypothesis subsequent study minute lead particle shrapnel disperse animal harvest ingest result increase lead serum level . This current observational study establishes conclusive interventional study possible establish hunter use lead projectile New Zealand elevate lead level eat animal harvest lead projectile . This study conduct compliance protocol , Good Clinical Practice Standards , associated regulation institutional research requirement . This study aim assess hunter eat meat shot lead projectile experience elevate lead level . Hunters ask provide blood sample 2-4 day eat meat harvest lead bullet provide subsequent sample abstain eat wild game harvest lead bullet . We choose use deer specie study reduce variation New Zealand ideal place conduct study year-round hunting deer . This design allow pair test subject lead level .</brief_summary>
