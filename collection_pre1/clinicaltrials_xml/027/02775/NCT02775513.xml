	<detailed_description>Loss-of-function mutation voltage-gated potassium channel cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) due prolong cardiac repolarisation phase . Voltage-gated potassium ( Kv- ) channel know relation malignant cardiac arrhythmia , also play role pancreatic alpha- beta cell hormone secretion , possibly incretin hormone secretion . We hypothesise patient loss-of-function mutation also exhibit altered hormone release upon glucose ingestion .</detailed_description>
