	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Azacitidine Subcutaneous Combination With Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) Previously Untreated Subjects With Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) Elderly Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The enrollment period study expect last approximately 15 month . The treatment follow-up period expect conclude approximately 12 month last subject randomize . Therefore , total duration study expect approximately 27 month , first subject enrol last subject last visit . Eligible subject randomize receive subcutaneous azacitidine alone combination durvalumab . The treatment phase conduct 2 stage , interim analysis futility purpose , 2 study cohort determine whether cohort proceeds Stage 2 outline Section 9 . The primary analysis follow completion Stage 2 additional analysis conduct approximately 12 month last subject enrol , describe Section 9 . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) immunogenicity sample perform subject receive combination therapy ass durvalumab PK profile development antidrug antibody .</detailed_description>
