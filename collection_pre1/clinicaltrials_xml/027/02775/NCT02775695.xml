	<brief_title>Efficacy Doxycycline Metakaryote Cell Death Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Pancreatic tumor two distinct cell population -- eukaryotic tumor cell metakaryotic cell . The first cell type divide quickly must stop certain point . Metakaryotic cell , also call cancer stem cell , divide less frequently unlimited number cell division . Chemotherapy work well eukaryotic cell . Metakaryotic cell resistant chemotherapy radiation , difficult eliminate . Massachusetts Institute Technology basic science researcher work Medical College Wisconsin pancreatic cancer group demonstrate laboratory doxycycline kill eukaryotic metakaryotic cell . This study 's goal discover metakaryocidal drug doxycycline kill significant fraction metakaryotic cell find treat pancreatic tumor . Targeting metakaryotic cell may decrease cancer relapse metastasis . The development antimetakaryotics vital pancreatic cancer patient , risk disease recurrence cancer-related death . STUDY OBJECTIVES : Primary Objectives : To assess efficacy doxycycline induce metakaryotic cell death primary pancreatic tumor patient resectable pancreatic cancer . Secondary Objectives : - To determine plasma drug concentration study drug baseline day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , restaging time surgery . - To assess histopathologic treatment response primary tumor undergo neoadjuvant gemcitabine base chemoradiation concurrent doxycycline therapy . - To enumerate number observe dead/dying metakaryotes per 1 gram resect pancreatic tissue . STUDY PROCEDURES : Patients take 100 mg doxycycline twice daily period eight week ( 56 day ) . Following standard-of-care ( study trial-related ) chemotherapy , patient receive radiation therapy . Patients receive doxycycline begin first day radiation therapy . Following , patient undergo surgery four five week completion chemoradiation . Doxycycline discontinue five seven day prior surgery . This study involve pharmacokinetic study , mean patient blood draw several time serum level may evaluate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm pancreatic adenocarcinoma may acquire use fine needle aspiration . Not receive prior therapy . Established resectable pancreatic cancer base radiographic imaging . Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy ( chemoradiation ) eligible . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) . Have active chronic infection HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Life expectancy great six month . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Normal organ marrow function define : 1. leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL 2. absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL 3. platelet ≥100,000/mcL 4. total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL demonstrate progressive decline within two week biliary decompression allow appropriate gemcitabine dose modification . 5 . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤3 × institutional upper limit normal 6 . Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 Patients clinically advance pancreatic cancer ( borderline resectable , locally advanced , metastatic ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study effect metakaryocidal agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Previous history malignancy ( cure basal squamous cell carcinoma skin cure insitu carcinoma cervix ) within two year study enrollment . Active chronic HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C. Patients receive investigational drug enrol clinical trial . Inability undergo schedule blood acquisition per protocol . Drug specific exclusion include history allergic reaction tetracycline . Prior treatment doxycycline within seven day washout period prior initiate treatment alternate antimetakaryocidal medication .</criteria>
