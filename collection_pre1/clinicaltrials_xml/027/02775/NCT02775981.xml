	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Intranasal RX0041-002 Hepatic-Impaired Individuals Subjects With Normal Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , single dose , open-label study compare plasma pharmacokinetics safety RX0041-002 subject hepatic impairment age/gender/BMI-matched subject normal hepatic function . DOSAGE All subject receive single treatment consist four ( 4 ) ml 4 % solution RX0041-002 ( correspond 160 mg cocaine HCl ) apply 20 minute nostrils use cotton pledgets . RX0041-002 Topical Solution ( 4 % ) provide Sponsor , supply 4 mL bottle . RX0041-002 Topical Solution contains citric acid , D &amp; C Yellow No . 10 , FD &amp; C Green No . 3 , sodium benzoate , water . DURATION OF STUDY Total duration study participation subject approximately 23 day count variable 30 day adverse event follow-up resolution , require . During time , subject screen maximum 21 day confine study unit approximately 45 hour Day -1 evaluation , dose ( Day 1 ) , blood sample safety assessment ( Day 1-2 ) . NUMBER OF SUBJECTS A sufficient number subject enrol complete 12 subject hepatic impairment , male female volunteer ≥ 18 year age . An additional 12 healthy , non-hepatically impaired , male female volunteer enrol comparator group . These subject approximately age , body mass index ( BMI ) &amp; gender-matched subject hepatic impairment . Hepatic impairment classify moderate severe grade/class define accord Child-Pugh classification ( Class B C ) . The liver impairment identify typical medical history , physical examination , coagulation abnormal liver function test ( include bilirubin albumin ) screening . SAFETY PARAMETERS Prior enrollment ( screen ) completion study , premature discontinuation , subject undergo complete physical examination plus vital sign , clinical laboratory testing ( serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , coagulation . In addition , subject screen inclusion 12-lead electrocardiogram , urinary screen drug abuse blood test alcohol , serology test HIV antibody . Breath alcohol urine drug screen repeat check-in Day -1 study . Females child bear potential also screen inclusion serum pregnancy test . Urine pregnancy test also perform check-in Day -1 . Each subject query occurrence adverse experience follow dose blood sampling . Vital sign monitoring recording , obtain baseline ( pre-dose ) ( Day 1 ) . Blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate oral temperature take record every 15 minute begin immediately prior dose every 15 minute first 60 minute follow pledget insertion . For next 120 minute ( 180 minute ' post pledget insertion ) vital sign recording include blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate oral temperature measurement take record every 30 minute 180 minute ( 3 Hour ) post pledget insertion time point . Vital sign recording include blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate oral temperature measurement continue take record hour 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 32 hour time pledget insertion necessary patient clinically stable . A nasal exam conduct , visually , pre-dose ( Day 1 ) end study ( Day 2 ) determine irritation present application site follow drug administration . PHARMACOKINETIC BLOOD SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS Pharmacokinetic blood sample draw follow time relative initiation RX0041-002 dosing . Subjects dose blood pharmacokinetic sampling conduct 0 hour ( pre-dose ) , post dose : 7 minute , 15 minute , 20 minute , ( immediately pledget removal ) 30 minute , 45 minute , 60 minute , 75 minute , 90 minute , 105 minute , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 , 28 32 hour , base upon begin dose application . For time point , minimum 8 ml blood sample . Total concentration cocaine major metabolite determine sample .</detailed_description>
