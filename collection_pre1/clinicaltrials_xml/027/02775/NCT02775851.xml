	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Desmoplastic Melanoma That Can Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) patient resectable desmoplastic melanoma treat neoadjuvant MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . ( Cohort A ) II . To evaluate complete response rate ( confirm unconfirmed ) patient unresectable desmoplastic melanoma treat MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . ( Cohort B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 9 week response rate ( RR ) ( unconfirmed complete partial response ) . ( Cohort A ) II . To estimate median overall survival ( OS ) . ( Cohort A ) III . To evaluate safety tolerability MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) neoadjuvant set . ( Cohort A ) IV . To estimate median progression-free survival ( PFS ) . ( Cohort B ) V. To estimate median overall survival ( OS ) . ( Cohort B ) VI . To evaluate safety tolerability MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) setting . ( Cohort B ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate hypothesis high mutational load patient derive baseline tumor biopsy sample associate high response rate ( RR ) . II . To evaluate T cell infiltration tumor DM patient correlate response program cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) blockade . III . To evaluate clonality tumor infiltrate T cell DM patient correlate response PD-1 blockade . IV . To evaluate adaptive immune resistant mechanism DM tumor . OUTLINE : COHORT A : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course . Patients potentially resectable disease undergo surgery . Patients tumor progression unresectable disease , receive one additional course pembrolizumab . COHORT B : Patients unresectable disease receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 12 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
