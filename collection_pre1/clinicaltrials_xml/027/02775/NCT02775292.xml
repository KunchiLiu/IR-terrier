	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose nivolumab give together gene-modified T cell vaccine therapy treat patient solid tumor express cancer-testes antigen NY-ESO-1 gene AND spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) distant organ ( stage IV ) . T cell special type white blood cell ( immune cell ) ability kill cancer cell . Nivolumab may block PD-1 find T cell help immune system kill cancer cell . Placing modified gene NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor ( TCR ) patient ' T cell laboratory give back patient may help body build immune response kill tumor cell express NY-ESO-1 . Dendritic cell another type blood cell teach cell body look cancer cell attack . Giving dendritic cell vaccine NY-ESO-1 protein may help dendritic cell teach immune system target cancer cell express protein , help T cell attack cancer . Giving nivolumab together gene-modified T-cells dendritic cell vaccine may teach immune system recognize kill cancer cell express NY-ESO-1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety addition PD-1 block monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , NY-ESO TCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) adoptive cell transfer ( ACT ) dose escalation scheme two study cohort 1 mg/kg 3 mg/kg nivolumab intravenous ( i.v . ) every two week 2 year . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility deliver TCR transgenic cell dose PD-1 blockade patient . II . To determine persistence NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) serial peripheral blood sample biopsy accessible metastatic lesion . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether block PD-1 maintain antitumor functionality adoptively transfer TCR transgenic lymphocyte . II . To explore use positron emission tomography ( PET ) -based image use PET tracer ( 18F ) fluorodeoxy-glucose ( [ 18F ] FDG ) goal determine adoptively transfer NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered PBMC administer nivolumab home expand secondary lymphoid organ tumor deposit . III . Clinical antitumor activity record objective response rate . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study nivolumab . CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day -5 -4 fludarabine phosphate IV 15-30 minute day -4 -1 . NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC INFUSION : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC IV day 0 . NIVOLUMAB : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute day 0 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NY-ESO-1 ( 157-165 ) PEPTIDE PULSED DENDRITIC CELL ( DC ) : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 ( 157-165 ) peptide pulse DC intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , 14 , 28 . LOW DOSE ALDESLEUKIN ADMINISTRATION : Patients receive aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) 7 day begin day 1 maximum 14 dos . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 6 month 3 year least every 12 month 15 year .</detailed_description>
