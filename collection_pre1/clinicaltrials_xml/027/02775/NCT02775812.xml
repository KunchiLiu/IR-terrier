	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose pembrolizumab give together cisplatin intensity-modulated radiation therapy , treat patient stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Intensity-modulated radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving pembrolizumab cisplatin intensity-modulated radiation therapy may work well treat patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination pembrolizumab standard , adjuvant cisplatin-radiotherapy patient high-risk , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -negative head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , base upon dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe 1-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , local-regional failure ( LRF ) , rate distant metastases follow treatment adjuvant cisplatin-radiotherapy pembrolizumab . II . To describe toxicity combination cisplatin-radiotherapy pembrolizumab accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v. ) 4 , include immune-related adverse event ( AEs ) . III . To describe relationship baseline program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression 1-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) . IV . To describe baseline immune-inflammatory biomarkers tumor tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) , correlate 1-year DFS . V. To describe baseline change expression peripheral immune-inflammatory biomarkers , include panel candidate tumor antigen ( TA ) -specific memory T cell , correlate 1-year DFS . OUTLINE : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour weekly week 1-6 pembrolizumab IV 30 minute every 3 week week 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 . Patients also undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) week 1-6 . Patients may also receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute week 3 , 6 , 24 , 27 . After completion study treatment , patient follow month 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 30 , 36 .</detailed_description>

Note : Patients may biopsy general anesthesia operating room follow definitive ablative cancer surgery represent gross total resection ; gross total resection do within 63 day prior registration ; , however , patient ablative resection demonstrate rapid gross recurrence determine gross persisting disease require reresection achieve gross total resection , patient eligible Patients must least one follow high risk pathologic feature : Extracapsular nodal extension Invasive cancer primary tumor resection margin ( tumor ink ) ; Note : Patients positive margin undergo reresection final negative margin eligible enrol within 63 day initial gross total resection AND extracapsular nodal extension also present ; patient positive margin undergo reresection final negative margin extracapsular nodal extension , NOT eligible Pathologic stage III IV HNSCC , include distant metastasis , base follow minimum diagnostic workup : General history/physical examination radiation oncologist and/or medical oncologist within 84 day prior registration Examination ear nose throat ( ENT ) head &amp;
