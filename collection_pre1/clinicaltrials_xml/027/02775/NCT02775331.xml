	<brief_title>The Use Worktime Planning Tools Finnish Public Sector . A Quasi-experimental Study ( PLANTOOLS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Epidemiological study suggest shift work increase risk several major public health disease , cardiovascular disease depression . Shift work also associate work-life interaction work stress . Appropriate shift schedule expect modify health risk shift work sufficiently knowledge whether possible improve work time control health-supporting shift rotation characteristic ( shift ergonomics ) use different type shift planning tool , whether possible change work hour lead successful cost-saving change health well-being . There especially lack intervention study mean improve work hour woman old worker . Material method Software In Finnish public sector , basically three separate shift schedule software version currently available ( Titania , CGI© Finland , Finland ) . The first one ( Titania1 ) , interactive software support interactive shift rostering ( individual worktime control employee ) give guidance health-supporting shift ergonomics shift planner use employee use software . The second software ( Titania2 ) use shift planner , give similar guidance health-supporting shift ergonomics software Titania1 include option self-rostering . The third software ( Titania3 ) otherwise similar shift planning software Titania 2 ( use shift planner ) include neither self-rostering health-supporting shift ergonomics tool . The investigator use sample software develop earlier , retrieve daily objective work hour absence data employers´ record . The reliability , validity accuracy use method retrieve analyze pay-roll data work hour assess earlier base partially dataset study . The raw data include data calendar day shift start end time , use shift wish reason absence . The raw data process individual level data construction variable within specific time frame ( i.e . shift characteristic base length , time , recovery social aspect work hour per month year ) . Study design Using non-randomized quasi-experimental design , use self-rostering software include also option evaluate shift ergonomics compare use shift scheduling software without self-rostering option shift ergonomics evaluation secondly , shift schedule software usual ( without self-rostering shift ergonomics evaluation ) . Questionnaire registry data 2016-2017 intervention ( T2 ) compare baseline data 2012 2015 intervention ( T1 ) three group . Participants The use three different version shift planning software study approximately 6 000 employee shift plan units/departments account cluster analysis six hospital district ongoing Finnish Public Sector study . According 3/2016 information , 2/6 hospital district make managerial decision start use Titania1 software 2016 applicable ward , 2/6 hospital district decide start use Titania2 software , 2/6 organization decide remain Titania3 software . Participants hospital employee work unit use software ( 1-3 ) 6 hospital district since 9/2015 least one year , have/will answer questionnaire send worker organization 2015 2017 . Based earlier response rate cohort , expect sample size approximately 6000 employee , use least one version software , reply questionnaire 2015 2017 . In order minimize potential bias due non-randomization possible selection , shift plan unit ( cluster ) use Titania1 , Titania2 Titania3 match ) amount shift work ( % worker cluster non-day shift ) , b ) age c ) baseline level perceive work-time control ( intervention 1 : shift plan shift ergonomics self-rostering ) c ) shift ergonomics ( intervention 2 : shift ergonomics ) . The pay-roll base daily work hour data retrieve shift schedule program retrospectively begin 2012 prospectively end 2017 . In addition compare overall effect use Titania1 Titania2 tool compare Titania3 , subgroup analysis do base 1. registry-based individual use Titania1 Titania 2 software within group 2. possible change perceive worktime control objective shift characteristic 3. individual difference ( e.g . age , diurnal type , health ) . Thematic focus group interview perform participate organization gather end-user , shift-planner employers´ attitude , change process experience use Titania tool . This information use develop Titania tool accord feedback . The guideline Transparent Reporting Evaluations Non-randomized Designs ( TREND ) use report result .</detailed_description>
