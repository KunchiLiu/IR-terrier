	<brief_summary>The plantaris tendon recognise important factor non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy ( NIAT ) . A biomechanical study find plantaris tendon stiffer strong Achilles tendon ( AT ) , thus reduce capacity elongate response loading . This hypothesized result friction AT plantaris NIAT patient . Current treatment conservative management : physiotherapy high volume injection paratenon . However 29 % patient fail respond conservative management plantaris relate symptom require surgical excision strip ventral aspect AT 3cm medial incision . This perform theatres general anaesthetic good excellent result report 90 % case . Purely cut plantaris tendon use minimally invasive endoscopic technique also successful . The plantaris tendon easily visualize ultrasound scan ( USS ) tenotomy tendon USS guidance perform elsewhere . Tenotomy plantaris tendon USS guidance would necessitate 5mm incision may perform local anaesthetic out-patient . The current study thus plan randomise clinical trial compare outcome ( VISA-A score ultrasound tissue characterisation scan ) patient NIAT undergo plantaris release use open surgical procedure undergo minimally invasive US guide procedure . The former know provide good clinical outcome ; however latter could significantly reduce post-operative scarring , recovery time cost . Findings ensure ethical , quality cost effective patient care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Midportion Achilles tendinopathy find incidence 1.85 per 1000 general population report career-ending condition 5 % professional athlete . The mainstay treatment present typically prescription eccentric strengthening exercise , activity modification analgesia . If conservative intervention fail surgery indicate , wide range different procedure describe . Open Achilles surgery may successful 75-100 % patient debridement excision area tendinosis weaken tendon delay return sport 18 month . There currently grow acceptance role plantaris tendon development medial Achilles tendon ( AT ) pain focal medial Achilles tendinopathy . The plantaris arise lateral aspect supracondylar line femur , pass lateral medial deep medial gastrocnemius superficial soleus , insert medial aspect calcaneus . However wide variation exact insertion plantaris tendon observe distally . A large study examine 750 limb report 4 type distal insertion , study report 3 different insertion site , whilst recent study report 9 variation . Consistently 10-20 % plantaris tendon identify direct structural attachment AT . This variety insertion pattern may explain individual prone plantaris issue others . Friction plantaris tendon medial border Achilles tendon subsequent pain swell significant problem elite track field athlete , annual injury incidence 3.9-9.3 % report . Biomechanical study hypothesize due plantaris tendon stiffer strong Achilles tendon ( AT ) , thus reduce capacity elongate response loading . This thought cause friction AT plantaris contribute peritendon inflammation , induce tendinopathy change AT either neuro-inflammatory mediation via compressive mechanism . Twenty nine percent patient NIAT fail respond conservative management many give sport activity . Patients continue experience symptom may refer high volume injection paratenon ultrasound scan ( USS ) guidance - aim strip paratenon layer AT often become adherent fibrous band . This also strip neovascularization ventral surface AT - abnormal tissue nerve fibre within believe major pain generator NIAT . However , recognise sub-group patient NIAT isolate medially-located pain approximately 4-6cm insertion o calcis . On USS Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) plantaris tendon may see attach medial aspect AT ( either insert side AT directly rather os calcis become adherent fibrous tissue AT medial border ) . This level AT undergone 90 degree rotation corresponds soleus part tendon . Since plantaris tendon cross 2 joint ( originate knee insert os calcis ) whereas soleus cross one joint ( ankle ) may differential movement plantaris medial border AT create frictional syndrome subsequent focal inflammation tendinosis AT . The treatment `` plantaris syndrome '' fail respond conservative measure USS guide injection remove plantaris tendon surgically strip ventral aspect AT 3cm medial incision . This perform theatres general anaesthetic good excellent result report 90 % 94 % professional athlete return sport.3 However , paper report successful treatment patient purely cut plantaris tendon use minimally invasive endoscopic technique.The plantaris tendon easily visualize USS tenotomy tendon USS guidance describe elsewhere . Performing tenotomy plantaris tendon USS guidance would necessitate 5mm incision may perform local anaesthetic out-patient . Currently known whether good open surgical procedure perform theatre investigator would propose randomize study compare technique . The rationale current study therefore compare clinical outcome AT structural change patient NIAT undergo plantaris excision use open surgical procedure undergo minimally invasive US guide procedure perform out-patient clinic . The former know provide good clinical outcome however latter could significantly reduce post-operative scarring , recovery time surgical cost . Thus , find comparable , treat patient clinic ultrasound guided plantaris release would offer desirable alternative surgery result change current clinical intervention population .</detailed_description>
