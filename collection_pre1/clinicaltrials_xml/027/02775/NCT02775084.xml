	<brief_title>Fish Oil T Cell Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generalized inflammation consistently associate age metabolic disease , often characterize reduced muscle cognitive function . Although much aging-associated inflammation attribute chronic activation innate host defense system , activate CD4+ T cell show contribute directly pathogenesis several inflammatory disease . In human , dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) , particularly docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , anti-inflammatory property reduce disease symptom , part , suppression CD4+ T cell activation . Therefore , Researchers ' overall hypothesis dietary supplementation DHA EPA human ameliorate inflammatory symptom , part , suppress CD4+ T cell activation , positively affect muscle cognitive function .</detailed_description>
