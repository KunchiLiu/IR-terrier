	<detailed_description>SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND OF STUDY , EXPECTED OUTCOME , AND RELEVANCE Sarcomas represent malignant bone soft tissue tumour . Overall , rare tumour represent less 1 % cancer ( besides carcinoma haematological cancer ) . Furthermore , advent molecular knowledge , 100 subtypes sarcomas distinguish many share distinct biological behaviour open possibility target therapy . The management patient sarcomas extremely complex highly multidisciplinary , involve pathologist , orthopaedic oncologist , paediatric medical oncologist , radiation oncologist , reconstructive well visceral chest surgeon . Surgery remain mainstay treatment , almost always combination either radiotherapy chemotherapy , novel target therapy . The key successful therapy ( consequent successful outcome patient ) remain orchestrated team approach among discipline therapeutic strategy interdisciplinary determine sarcoma board . Unfortunately , often still nowadays , patient also Switzerland treat within network . E.g. , many surgeon still believe capable remove soft tissue lump ( technically true ) , send patient surgery medical oncologist , never see patient . All often may result example unnecessary amputation , devastate consequence patient . A surgeon need aware interpretation pathologic specimen , possibility adjuvant treatment , importantly , biology subtype sarcoma , embark surgery . Because reason list , reasonable centralize treatment sarcoma patient improve treatment outcome sarcoma patient Switzerland , foreseen current initiative HSM GDK . It important state uncoordinated treatment sarcoma patient potential deleterious consequence international phenomenon . Many group independently establish lack interdisciplinarity lead bad patient outcome survival . Many reason account : rarity disease , lack knowledge , lack awareness , often also pride prestige . The way bring treat physician together make institution aware apply simple management strategy -such coordinate treatment- improve outcome sarcoma patient , proven many country already . Nowadays Switzerland , groups/institutions deal exclusively sarcoma patient . Consequently , therapeutic approach quality vary lot . Therefore , establishment Swiss Sarcoma Cohort Study ( SwissSARCOS ) instrumental improve quality treatment , already show country . If patient register include respective follow-up , type treatment register various geographic region compare respect patient ` outcome . It expect awareness treat sarcoma patient accord international standard increase , benefit patient . Importantly , registration provide base participate international study form clinical trial , prerequisite also request HSM , improve quality therapy sarcoma patient Switzerland . Such cohort study also allow ass prevalence sarcoma type Switzerland , associate regional difference . Because rarity , register sarcoma type Switzerland bring together sizeable number therefore provide base numerous outcome study . Because know sarcoma extremely heterogeneous molecularly define , study molecular alteration tumour tissue essential advance field . The French Sarcoma Group ( Prof. JM.Coindre , F.Chibon ) start initiative decade ago therefore leader field . The investigator therefore speculate SwissSARCOS ultimately also provide strong base establish sarcoma tissue bank allows study molecular alteration one hand , hand correlate finding clinical outcome . For reason outline , establishment SwissSARCOS crucial improve treatment quality sarcoma patient Switzerland . The specific question address within first 2-year time period include : 1 . ) prevalence sarcoma type Switzerland ; 2 . ) What quality ( correct ) diagnosis ? ; 3 . ) What quality treatment ? ; 4 . ) What outcome ( survival , local recurrence , metastasis etc . ) sarcoma patient Switzerland ? Complete identification thorough assessment basic clinical parameter ( `` minimal data set '' ) sarcoma patient treat Switzerland prospective manner allow improve quality patient care outline . This also line national strategy register cancer patient . Therefore , effort timely direct impact public health issue . As show cohort study Switzerland ( e.g . HIV ) , assessment clinical parameter widespread implication standard patient care , also address important clinical research question , thereby become relevant health care issue . Through coordinate orchestrated approach , Switzerland become key player international collaboration improve treatment sarcoma patient . It clear expect include every single patient diagnose sarcoma whole Switzerland right begin . Obviously , intention first set strong base national key player institution , strengthen collaborative network become national instrument . The network national key player institution allow bring regional effort national level . The Sarcoma Center Zurich ( www.sarkomzentrum.ch ) certify center excellence German Cancer Society ( DKG= Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft ) since December 2013 , first one Switzerland . The Sarcoma Center Zurich base instrumental effort cantonal government ( `` Regierungsrat '' ) specifically support multidisciplinary team approach musculoskeletal oncology , clinical research side since 2010 HSM program ( www.sarkomboard.ch ) . Over year , collaboration major regional hospital Switzerland set . All collaborator hospital assemble strengthen goal build Sarcoma Cohort Study . For reason Sarcoma Center Zurich lead multicentre study ethic committee Zurich choose leading committee . Future : Molecular analysis sarcoma tissue key advancement treatment strategy sarcoma patient . Again base HSM program fund cantonal government Zurich , tumour tissue specimen well blood collect store single patient operate sarcoma Zurich . This allow address fundamental molecular question via TMA ( tissue microarray analysis ) , characterization molecular marker , in-vitro in-vivo , proteomic diagnostic analysis , novel target treatment approach ( please refer www.sarkomzentrum.ch ) . It foreseen second phase grant project -and establish fundamental national cohort study- extend effort gather patient data ( `` minimal data set '' ) , also tumour tissue/blood sarcoma patient treat Switzerland . In next step , base effort outline nationally well documented patient cohort , base set participate international clinical trial test example novel drug compound novel diagnostic imaging tool .</detailed_description>
