	<brief_summary>As end stage almost cardiovascular disease , heart failure become increasingly common cause cardiovascular morbidity mortality worldwide . In China , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) become main cause heart failure recent year . CAD combine heart failure usually predict poor outcome , coronary revascularization universally use therapy . However , difference several type therapy less well compare . Thus , study mainly aim compare different type coronary revascularization therapy Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) , Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG ) well Hybrid Coronary Revascularization ( HCR ) , also make optimization strategy especially patient heart failure . The study also aim investigate whether disease progression patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) assess new biomarkers determine diagnostic prognostic value , relate several cardiac functional parameter clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Strategy Coronary Revascularization Patients With Multivessel Lesions Combined Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This single center prospective study mainly design compare different type coronary revascularization therapy patient severe coronary artery disease combine heart failure . We collect data baseline therapy , well 30 day , 6 month 12 month surgery . Using follow-up visit along effective exam echocardiography , cardiopulmonary function mensuration test serum marker , principally make comparison primary secondary outcome , also quality life among patient three group . STUDY POPULATION About 525 patient diagnose severe CAD HF enrol . Severe CAD define least 2 vessel disease ≥50 % narrow luminal diameter show coronary angiography , include LAD . Those enrol also reduce cardiac systolic function ( LVEF≤50 % ) . STUDY DURATION It take 2 year finish follow-up visit patient least 12 month surgery . STUDY PROCESS The statistical analysis include material patient every follow-up visit . We describe basic characteristic test parameter every visit , compare PCI , CABG HCR group , investigate prognostic influence therapeutic method . Data analysis process SPSS . All analysis use 2-side test 95 % confidence interval , show statistical significance 2-side p value less 0.05 . The study finally report primary secondary outcome , well change several important parameter .</detailed_description>
