	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate potential effect renal impairment systemic pharmacokinetics acute Intranasal RX0041-002 . The secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability acute intranasal RX0041-002 subject normal renal function severe renal impairment . 2 INVESTIGATOR/STUDY SITE The study conduct Comprehensive Clinical Research Berlin , New Jersey . The principal investigator Dr. David Hassman . Institutional review perform Chesapeake Institutional Review Board.. 3 BACKGROUND Cocaine Hydrochloride Topical Solution ( 4 % ) currently available induction local ( topical ) anesthesia accessible mucous membrane oral , laryngeal nasal cavity ( DESI product ) . Pennsylvania Pain Specialists ( PPS ) seek FDA approval RX0041-002 topical anesthetic diagnostic surgical procedure nasal cavity . Cocaine naturally-derived local anesthetic long history use . Like structurally-related local anesthetic , cocaine produce direct effect cell membrane . Cocaine block sodium channel activity thus prevent generation conduction nerve impulse electrically active cell . Cocaine also vasoconstriction property surgical diagnostic procedure mucous membrane nasal cavity decrease operative bleed improves surgical visualization . The therapeutic use cocaine hydrochloride , 4 % solution topically apply nasal septum local anesthesia report public clinical literature never receive official FDA approval indication . It use surgical procedure involve nose , throat , larynx low respiratory passage blood loss highly vascularized area considerable may also obscure operative field . The pharmacokinetics cocaine administer via nasal absorption report literature . However , regardless route administration , several study show cocaine plasma half-life 0.5-1.5 h , apparent volume distribution 2-3 L/kg , apparent systemic clearance ≈2 L/min . Only 1-5 % cocaine clear unmetabolized urine , may detect 3-6 h use . The primary pathway cocaine elimination hydrolysis two ester group form two major inactive metabolite , ecgonine methyl ester ( EME ) benzoylecgonine ( BE ) , half-lives approximately 4 6 h , respectively . These compound constitute 80 % cocaine 's metabolite detect urine 14-60 h cocaine administration . Norcocaine , minor active metabolite , form cytochrome P450 ( CYP 3A4 ) mediate N-demethylation cocaine . However , 2 % - 6 % cocaine metabolize norcocaine human . The present study conduct evaluate potential effect renal impairment pharmacokinetics cocaine , major metabolite active metabolite ( norcocaine ) ( 4 % ) intranasal cocaine HCl topical administration , typical clinical dose 160 mg. 4 SUMMARY OF DRUG INFORMATION RX0041-002 ( Cocaine HCl , USP ) crystalline , granular , powder substance saline , slightly bitter taste numbs tongue lip . Each mL RX0041-002 Topical Solution contain Cocaine HCl 40 mg ( 4 % ) aqueous solution . 5 SUBJECT POPULATION The subject population study include male female adult ( ≥ 18 year ) . A sufficient number subject enrol complete 8 subject severe renal impairment 8 subject normal renal function . The subject normal renal function select order match subject renal impairment term age , sex BMI . For assignment treatment group , severe renal impairment define eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 . Normal renal function define eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2 .</detailed_description>
