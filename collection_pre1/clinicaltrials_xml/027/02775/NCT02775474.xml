	<brief_summary>The recent increase obesity lead increase need bariatric surgery . In group patient postoperative pain management vital importance . One strategy improve postoperative analgesia use intraoperative methadone , specially patient regional anesthesia feasible . There evidence use intraoperative methadone lead analgesia last 24 36 hour , associate increased side effect compare opioids short intermediate duration action . In study investigator evaluate efficacy intraoperative methadone reduce postoperative pain opioid consumption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Intraoperative Methadone Prevent Postoperative Pain Bariatric Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent development postoperative pain control , many patient still suffer moderate severe pain surgery . It estimate postoperative severe pain occur 20 40 % surgical procedure . With recent increase obesity incidence last year , need bariatric surgical intervention great . The management postoperative pain obese patient particularly important , since population increase susceptibility cardiovascular , pulmonary thromboembolic perioperatively . One strategy improve pain management perioperative period intraoperative use intravenous methadone , give pharmacokinetic profile , specially patient regional anesthesia contraindicate . Methadone opioid Î¼ ( MOR ) receptor agonist , also glutamate antagonist block N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor reuptake serotonin noradrenaline inhibitor . Intraoperative analgesia generate administration 20 30 mg methadone last 24 36 hour . There also evidence methadone 0.2 0.3 mg / kg associate increased incidence side effect compare opioids short intermediate duration action , fentanyl , sufentanyl morphine . The aim study evaluate efficacy intraoperative methadone reduce postoperative pain opioid consumption patient undergo open gastroplasty without associate Roux Y . Patients undergo standardized general anesthesia , opioid use anesthesia induction methadone 0.15 mg / kg fentanyl 6 mcg / kg bolus additional necessary . After extubation intravenous morphine patient control analgesia device already available operate room . Groups compare regard opioid consumption , pain score , side effect , patient satisfaction development chronic postoperative pain .</detailed_description>
