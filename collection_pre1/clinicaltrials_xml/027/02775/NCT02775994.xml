	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : Primary objective : Patients experience least 50 % reduction PFAPA flare next 2 consecutive month receive single dose canakinumab ( 4 mg/kg ) . Secondary objective : 1 . Time flare 2 . Parent/patient quality life assessment Study rationale : Periodic Fever , Aphthous stomatitis , Pharyngitis cervical Adenitis ( PFAPA ) one common , least explored periodic fever syndrome childhood . It discover 1987 Marshall et al . notice periodic attack fever along pharyngitis cervical adenitis mimic streptococcal acute tonsillitis . Many patient erroneously treat antibiotic despite negative throat culture . The exact prevalence syndrome know PFAPA seem far frequent auto-inflammatory disease . Since PFAPA unknown etiology lack specific laboratory marker , diagnosis make use clinical criterion include three documented episode fever , last five day occur regular interval range three six week , pharyngitis plus tender cervical lymphadenopathy aphthous ulcer , normal growth parameter good health episode . Single dose glucocorticoid usually lead prompt resolution disease . Their usefulness therapy , however , limited fact glucocorticoid treatment result shorten interval attack 30 percent case even weekly attack . Prophylaxis therapy cimetidine colchicine limit value child respond . Some physician try use , mainly patient suffer frequent attack despite glucocorticoid therapy last resort tonsillectomy , however , many child eventually undergo tonsillectomy , many case , prevent attack may cause morbidity even mortality . The pathogenesis PFAPA still fully understood . However , rapid response corticosteroid treatment suggest immune dysregulation . Recent study suggest , autoinflammatory syndrome , essential role innate immune system activation inflammasome fever attack lead production Interleukin 1 along proinflammatory cytokine chemokines indeed , treatment anakinra report cause remission adult patient resistant PFAPA clinical use several medical center US . Timelines Study duration : Start date : within 2 month Helsinki committee approval- estimate first patient first visit ( FPFV ) -1 month Estimated Last Patient Last treatment ( LPLT ) last patient first treatment ( LPFT ) /last patient ( LP ) enrollment - 6 month End date : 6 month last patient enrollment Once enrol , patient receive single dose Canakinumab follow period total 24 week receive Canakinumab - weekly first month monthly next 5 month . Study Report date : within 4 month Last Patient Last Visit . Publication date : within 10 month Last Patient Last Visit . Methodology : This single arm open label pilot study . This study approve institutional national Helsinki committee . Patients age 2-10 year old diagnose PFAPA accord clinical criterion least 3 month prior enrollment regular care disease ( single dose glucocorticoid flare ) suffer 4 PFAPA flare last 2 month , screen study . Patients another chronic disease , neutropenia , elevate liver enzymes diagnosis PFAPA doubt , exclude . In addition patient receive treatment cimetidine/famotidine , montelukast colchicine undergo washout period 2 week ( see appendix ) . . Screening period : After sign informed consent fill demographic clinical questionnaire , patient enter screen period one month . At screen visit , participant undergo purify protein derivative ( PPD ) test rule tuberculosis laboratory workup include : Complete blood count ( CBC ) , full chemistry panel , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) urinalysis . During period , first PFAPA flare treat single dose oral glucocorticoid ( give part regular care ) response document PI co-PI formal study visit . Enrolment : In second documented flare , patient enrol receive single dose SC Canakinumab 4 mg/kg . Treatment glucocorticoid second flare allow . Patients less 2 flare screen period option enrol next consecutive month long 2 document PFAPA flare month . Patients , fail flare phase well , censor ( screen failure ) . Once patient experience flare administration canakinumab , He treat accord clinician/ researcher decision ( e.g . - dose corticosteroid ) . All flare document follow-up period . Number center &amp; patient : 10 patient recruit 1 center ( Pediatric rheumatology unit -Schneider child 's medical center Israel ) . Potential patient pediatric rheumatology clinic around country refer clinic . Sample size justification : This pilot study power statistical significance . Population : Key inclusion criterion 1 . Patients age 2-10 year old diagnose PFAPA least 3 month prior enrollment accord clinical criterion screen study . 2 . Suffer 4 PFAPA flare 2 month prior screen period . 3 . Have sign inform consent study . 4 . Have least 2 documented PFAPA flare screen period . Key exclusion criterion 1 . Patients diagnose chronic disease include another auto inflammatory disease . 2 . Patients suffer neutropenia elevate liver enzyme . 3 . Patients receive treatment cimetidine/famotidine , montelukast colchicine 2 week less prior enrollment . Pharmacovigilance requirement : Definition AE : Any untoward medical occurrence subject administer pharmaceutical product necessarily causal relationship treatment . An AE therefore unfavorable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal ( investigational ) product , whether consider related investigational medicinal product . Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP ) include drug evaluation comparator drug ( ) specify part research objective , give time study . Medical conditions/diseases present start drug interest consider adverse event worsen start drug interest . The occurrence adverse event seek non-directive question patient visit study . Adverse event also may detect volunteered patient visit physical examination , laboratory test , assessment . All adverse event record study database include follow information : 1. severity grade ( mild , moderate , severe ) 2. relationship drug ( ) interest ( suspected/not suspect ) 3. duration ( start end date continue final exam ) 4. whether constitutes serious adverse event ( SAE ) A SAE untoward medical occurrence dose : - result death , - life-threatening , - require inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization , - result persistent significant disability/incapacity , - congenital anomaly/birth defect , - otherwise significant medical event . This include SAEs likely arise trial indication progression underlying/concomitant illness ( e.g . progression cancer oncology trial ) , unless specify protocol study specific exemption . Any SAE , irrespective causality , occur subject provide informed consent four week subject stop study participation must report unless otherwise state protocol . SAEs occur four week end study participation report consider Investigator attributable exposure investigational drug ( ) trial period . This include period study protocol interfere standard medical treatment give subject , even study treatment yet start ( e.g . withdrawal previous treatment washout period , change treatment fix dose concomitant medication ) . Timelines : All serious adverse event ( SAEs ) interventional clinical trial must report site Sponsor within 24 hour occurrence SAE . The timeline investigator initiate trial report Novartis do per Third Party Study/Investigator Initiated Trial Agreement . Follow-up report : SAEs follow resolution judge permanent , assessment make visit ( frequently , necessary ) change severity , suspect relationship drug interest , intervention require treat , outcome . The Sponsor shall support Novartis following-up SAEs complete information available maintain patient safety also part commitment Novartis Health authority OR specific Health authority follow-up request product investigation . Pregnancies : N/A Evaluation criterion : Primary endpoint : Efficacy measure - 50 % reduction PFAPA flare next 2 consecutive month report patient ( use diary ) document patient primary care physician and/ researcher monthly follow visit . This compare average number flare ( per 2 month ) last 3 consecutive month therapy ( i.e number flare last 3 month therapy divide 3 multiply 2 ) . Secondary endpoint : 1 . Time flare ( period administration single dose canakinumab first document PFAPA flare . Will compare average time 2 consecutive flare therapy ( e.g . : first document flare- day 1 . In follow 90 day 5 flare ( 3 screen 2 ) = 90/5= 18d mean time flare ) . 2 . Parent/patient quality life assessment measure 100mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) difference screen vs. 2 month administration single dose canakinumab .</detailed_description>
