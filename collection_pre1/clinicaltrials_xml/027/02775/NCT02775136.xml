	<brief_summary>HS-1000 device , proprietary new non-invasive brain monitor , expect safely accurately monitor physiological sign brain minimal discomfort patient , provide information normal abnormal brain-related condition provide decision-making support physician . Investigators hypothesis HS-1000 capable detect monitor various neuropathologies , use acoustic raw data derive noninvasive procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation Non-invasive Brain Monitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive modality brain monitoring potentially serve major contribution conventional monitoring technique patient neuropathologies , assure minimal discomfort bedbound patient , provide information critical physiological sign physician . The lack precise diagnostic technique numerous neuropathologies patient neurosurgical clinic hinder therapeutic effectiveness , therefore , influence patient recovery healing . Neuro-critical care involve monitor standard vital sign cerebral physiological sign , mainly focus intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , temperature , cerebral blood flow velocity , arterial blood pressure , cerebral perfusion pressure , brain tissue oxygenation etc . The collaboration state art brain monitoring vary different intensive care unit serve significant drawback case , accuracy diagnosis monitoring challenge thereby eminent need interrelationship brain monitoring approach . That also leverage apply monitoring noninvasively , particularly beneficial clinical application routinely require inevitable dynamic transport patient hospital unit ( image , surgical room , etc. ) . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion study , sign informed consent form , enrol study . Eligible patient divide 2 group : 1 . Patients undergo Invasive ICP monitoring 2 . Subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) patient Fisher Grade 3 4 The non-invasive measurement record session accord protocol scheme per group : 1 . Eligible patient undergo Invasive ICP monitoring monitor HS-1000 , parallel invasive ICP monitor , single recording session . 2 . Eligible SAH patient Fisher Grade 3 4 monitor HS-1000 , parallel invasive ICP monitor , three record session . For eligible patient , non-invasive measurement HS-1000 device conduct parallel standard monitoring modality , use site without change patient 's management .</detailed_description>
