	<brief_title>The National Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center , prospective cohort study enrol patient center National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) National Clinical Trials Network ( NCTN ) NCI Community Oncology Research Program ( NCORP ) . The accrual period 5+ year . After central pathology review register participant , approximately 2,000 case MDS MDS/MPN overlap disorder , 500 case ICUS identify longitudinal study cohort 1000 case identify cross-sectional cohort . No 3500 total participant register . Participants longitudinal cohort may follow life . The goal National MDS Study establish publicly available resource facilitate study MDS natural history . This accomplish : 1 ) Creation multi-institutional , longitudinal collection consistently process clinically well-annotated blood tissue specimen collect prospectively participant MDS participant idiopathic cytopenia undetermined significance ( ICUS ) ; 2 ) Support investigator-initiated study MDS high-impact MDS patient , include basic science , clinical , health outcomes epidemiological research .</detailed_description>
