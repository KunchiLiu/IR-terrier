	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine MRI characteristic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease subject baseline yearly period 5 year , correlate biomarkers pulmonary function test , CT scan , 6 Minute-walk test , respiratory questionnaire . The central hypothesis quantitative assessment lung magnetic resonance image hyperpolarized 3He detect early alteration structure function precursor clinically apparent COPD precursor use predict progression disease earlier well establish clinical method . Novel assessment use 3He MRI lead new information COPD critical characterize disease response therapy . A secondary hypothesis variety technical improvement technique hyperpolarized gas MRI accelerate translation relatively new modality clinical use .</brief_summary>
