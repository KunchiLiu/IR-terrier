	<brief_summary>Changing microbiota become intriguing target intervention inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Dietary therapy successful mild moderate Crohn 's disease may effective mild moderate ulcerative colitis ( UC ) well , though dietary intervention UC get underway . However intervention less likely effective severely inflame refractory end spectrum . Fecal transplantation ( FT ) suggest method treat refractory IBD , study unsuccessful establish remission especially prolonged remission . The investigator hypothesize due selection random donor inability maintain optimal microbiota eco system post transplant . Diet powerful tool modulate microbiota . The investigator propose modify FT use novel protocol approach develop . We develop unique diet gear rectify dysbiosis UC damage mucous layer active UC . The investigator intend condition donor recipient diet achieve optimal condition transplant succeed donor recipient .The investigator intend evaluate protocol adult active UC refractory medication . The investigator start randomize controlled trial involve 76 transplanted patient , however first pilot stage The investigator enroll 34 patient , extend study trend well outcomes dietary conditioning protocol . Furthermore , The investigator hope identify successful donor period use study extension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Fecal Transplantation Using Unique Diet Donor Recipient Moderate Severe Treatment Refractory Colitis Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first exploratory phase take place 34 subject age 18-60 , refractory establish UC , 12 week . Study type- It open label 3 arm multicenter randomize control single blind study , review endoscopic activity blind reviewer . Patients randomize one three group ; Group 1 undergo standard fecal transplantation colonoscopy day 1 60 ml rectal enema day 2 14 donor without dietary conditioning , Group 2 undergo transplantation ( colonoscopy enema night day 2 day 14 ) , dietary pre-conditioning donor 14 day dietary treatment recipient immediately transplantation follow 12 weeks.We attempt use donor group 1 2 use precondition stool group 1 post conditioning stool group 2 order control `` donor effect '' . Group 3 receive dietary therapy . Should first stage successful , The investigator continue fecal transplantation trial reach target enrolment number ( 76 patient ) transplantation . This second stage study involve fecal transplantation additional 52 patient order total 76 transplanted patient two phase . since physician able distinguish stool color saline colonoscopy . Subjects may continue stable medication start new medication 8 week period unless fail respond . Steroid wean commence day 14 . Patients see weeks0 , 2 , 6 , 8 , 12 week 20 . Week 6 dietitian visit . The last visit visit diet evaluate sustainability initial intervention , safety change BMI due FT diet . A telephone conversation ass SCCAI make week 1 week 7 . At visit ( week 0 , 2 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 20 ) patient Weight , disease activity score , PGA , CBC , CRP , albumin complete chemistry panel perform . Adverse event medication use recorded visit.Stool sample microbiome ( 16S rDNA , Short chain fatty acid analysis ) Calprotectin measure locally baseline , week 2 , 8 12 . All patient ( patient group 1,2 3 ) repeat sigmoidoscopy perform week 8 . A food diary collect week 2 12 . A compliance questionnaire complete week 2 , 8and 12 . A 24 hour recall collect week 0 , 2 6 . Open Label treatment refractory patient : Patients group 1 3 improve week 8 ( day 56 ) may treat identical protocol use Group 2 physician discretion receive therapy . These patient see day 14 56 , monitor dietary compliance food diary day 14 56 biological sample . Patients group 1 2 remission FT , may receive 2 rescue enemas 8 week study original donor .</detailed_description>
