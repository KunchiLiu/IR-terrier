	<brief_summary>Background : In patient undergo lung lobectomy , lung collapse re-expansion resection associate severe oxidative lung injury . The researcher hypothesize remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) could reduce oxidative lung injury improve oxygenation parameter . Methods : We design single-centre , randomize , prospective double-blind study , conduct fifty-three patient non-small cell lung cancer undergo elective lung lobectomy . Fifty-three patient randomly assign 2 group : 26 patient receive limb RIPC ( 3 cycle : 5 min ischemia/5 min reperfusion induce ischemia cuff apply thigh ) 27 control . Time course oxidative stress marker level simultaneously study exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) blood four specific time point : T0 , pre-operatively ; T1 , operate lung collapse one-lung ventilation ( OLV ) ; T2 , immediately resume two-lung ventilation ( TLV ) ; T3 , 120 min resume TLV . EBC 8-isoprostane primary outcome . Secondary outcome include PaO2/FiO2 , pulmonary oxygenation variable , oxidative marker ( NO2-+NO3- , H2O2 ) pH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In patient non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) , surgical resection remain primary preferred approach treatment stage I-II NSCLC . Despite advance surgical technique , patient risk development severe lung injury , lobectomy operate lung completely collapse hypoperfused . This hypoperfusion due part reactive hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response alveolar hypoxia , optimize gas exchange . Hypoxic ischemic tissue increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) production mitochondrion respiratory chain , respiratory cytochrome become redox-reduced allow directly transfer electron O2 produce large amount superoxide anion , contribute vasoconstriction . The primary site ROS production hypoxia appear complex III , paradoxical increase ROS production hypoxia may explain effect O2 within mitochondrion inner membrane ubisemiquinone radical complex III . Thus , patient undergo lobar resection suffer relative lung ischemia-hypoxia collapse , follow expansion-reperfusion injury attribute production ROS . Acute lung injury ( ALI ) postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) major thoracic surgery remain leading cause death pulmonary surgery . Because date study assess subject detail , show recently also increase oxidative stress damage lung lobectomy , associate direct correlation lung collapse time oxidative stress marker level exhale breath condensate blood . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) emerge procedure different organ protection acute ischemia/reperfusion injury show different clinical trial . Although study conduct patient undergo coronary artery by-pass graft valvular heart surgery , also observe protective effect organ kidney , intestine others . RIPC innate powerful mechanism tissue organ expose transient episode ischemia-reperfusion confer global resistance subsequent episode ischemia remote organ . However potential mechanism RIPC work unclear . The signal transfer organs humoral , neuronal systemic communication , activate specific receptor , intracellular kinase mitochondrial function . Recently report limb RIPC attenuate intestinal pulmonary injury abdominal aortic aneurysm repair also pulmonary resection , find significant decrease serum malondialdehyde treat group RIPC . EBC collection non-invasive method obtain sample low respiratory tract , contain large number biomarkers include isoprostanes , nitrogen oxide hydrogen peroxide . The isoprostanes family product arachidonic acid produce non-enzymatic action ROS . Increased blood level 8-isoprostane consider reliable index lipid peroxidation vivo due chemical stability . NO . superoxide anion ( O2.- ) react form ONOO- , powerful oxidant . Nitrites ( NO2- ) nitrate ( NO3- ) end product nitric oxide ( NO . ) peroxynitrite anion ( ONOO- ) metabolism present epithelial lining fluid respiratory tract . Hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) ROS volatile molecule produce conversion superoxide anion ( O2.- ) H2O2 superoxide dismutase release inflammatory epithelial cell respiratory system . The aim study investigate whether RIPC would reduce oxidative lung injury cancer patient undergo lung lobectomy . The primary outcome study compare 8-isoprostene others oxidative marker level EBC blood patient receive RIPC control patient . Also evaluate whether correlation OLV duration oxidative stress marker level EBC blood .</detailed_description>
