	<brief_summary>Anorexia nervosa eat disorder characterize intense fear become fat despite obvious thinness extreme behavior weight loss . The result massive weight loss / pathological thinness . The care anorexia difficult treatment prove effective adult . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) neuromodulation technique use electrical current low intensity . It allow modulate corticospinal excitability : two electrode , anode ( excitatory ) cathode ( inhibitory ) , position skull accord region desire influence operation . Although tDCS show noticeable side effect , first necessary ass feasibility safety technique physically frail patient . A recent pilot study suggest acceptability , safety efficacy tDCS program patient anorexia nervosa . Given preliminary data extreme seriousness vulnerability patient resistant anorexia , investigator want ass risk / benefit ratio use technique patient suffer resistant anorexia nervosa . The current data preliminary consider randomize controlled trial , investigator hope , initially , replicate data pilot study second sample rigorous comprehensive assessment methodology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During stimulation , anode place left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex cathode right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Stimulation 2 milli-Ampere apply 25 minute session . 20 session conduct twice day respect period four hour session . The tDCS session start maximum 15 day inclusion visit . Two intermediate control visit conduct . One first week tDCS , immediately last session tDCS . The main assessment visit carry one month ( +/- 5 day ) last session tDCS . Finally reminder visit perform 6 month ( +/- 3 week ) last session tDCS assess stability time potential effect observe .</detailed_description>
