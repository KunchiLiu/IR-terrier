	<brief_title>Prospective Treatment Study Catatonia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catatonia first describe 1873 German psychiatrist , Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum monograph title `` Die Katatonie oder Das Spannungsirresein '' ( Catatonia tension insanity ) ( Kahlbaum , 1873 ) . He conceptualize catatonia motor syndrome characterize lack motion , speech , alternate period excessive purposeful motor activity , rigidity , negativism , verbigeration , automatic imbalance , posturing , grimace stereotype . He also describe syndrome generally periodic course lethal outcome . Despite long history , `` katatonia '' associate different illness give diagnostic specifier . DSM- V make change add catatonia independent diagnostic symptom . According DSM-V , catatonia characterize following : A. clinical picture dominate 3 follow symptom ( 1 ) Stupor ( 2 ) Catalepsy ( 3 ) Waxy flexibility ( 4 ) Mutism ( 5 ) Negativism ( 6 ) Posturing ( 7 ) Mannerism ( 8 ) Stereotypy ( 9 ) Agitation ( 10 ) Grimacing ( 11 ) Echolalia ( 12 ) Echopraxia B . There evidence history , physical examination laboratory finding disturbance direct patho-physiological consequence another medical condition . C. The disturbance well explain another mental disorder D. disturbance occur exclusively course delirium E. The disturbance cause clinically significant distress impairment social , occupational important area function Electroconvulsive therapy good track record treatment catatonia ( World J Psychiatr . 2015 June 22 ; 5 ( 2 ) : 182-192 ) , current literature shed light speed degree response catatonia ECT . This study aim analyze describe change clinical sign symptom response parameter judge ECT treatment series efficacy . This treatment study , able compare response rate catatonia right unilateral electroconvulsive treatment ( RUL ECT ) Bilateral electroconvulsive treatment ( BL ECT ) . Also control group catatonia patient , treat ECT provide additional information early ECT treatment Katatonia . Objectives : 1 . To study response rate catatonia right unilateral ( RUL ) ECT bilateral ( BL ) ECT . 2 . To compare response rate catatonia RUL ECT BL ECT 3 . To analyze describe change clinical sign symptom ECT treatment series Methods Measures : Design This study case control study . Currently ECT consider standard treatment catatonia addition alternative medication option . Study participant meet inclusion exclusion criterion provide informed consent randomly assign receive either bilateral electroconvulsive treatment ( BL ECT ) right unilateral electroconvulsive treatment ( RUL ECT ) . - Patients otherwise eligible consent participate study , refuse ECT ( one unable consent court appoint legal guardian health care power attorney refuse ECT ) enrol control group . The control group undergo laboratory investigation Bush Francis measurement evaluation catatonia receive ECT . - Informed consent obtain study participant legally authorize representative principal investigator sub-investigator . - Prior treatment patient examine clinician ( psychiatrist psychiatric resident ) follow information obtain : 1 . Psychiatric interview uniform questioner 2 . History present illness ( HPI ) onset , course presenting symptom , comorbidities , precipitate illness life event - emphasis upon psychological stress 3 . Substance abuse screen 4 . Psychiatric history - Psychiatric diagnosis age/date diagnosis 5 . Medical history , focus comorbid development chronic medical disease state - especially recent worsen change therapy 6 . Previous episode catatonia - date pertinent development social history ( noted HPI ) time course treatment response/failure ECT medications 7 . Recent medication change , specific focus timing symptom possible - regimen prior symptom/sign development , medication change , current medication 8 . Neurological condition - include Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , seizure history , neurodevelopmental disorder , delirium , dementia . The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MOCA ) administer day prior ECT treatment day ECT treatment pre post procedure cognitive monitoring . 9 . Incontinence 10 . Medical , metabolic , and/or psychiatric comorbidities record intentionally NOT exclude , limited exception : Cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) . 11 . Questionnaires rating scale : The following instrument administer trained clinician ( psychiatric resident , medical student ) : 1 . Bush- Francis Scale ( BFCRS ) : The BFCRS rating scale consist 23 catatonia item ( Bush et al. , 1996a ) . The first 14 item scale common , classical sings catatonia &amp; also know Catatonia Screening Instrument ( BFCSI ) . If two BFCSI sign present , 24 hour longer , catatonia possibility ( Sienaert et al , 2011 ) . For purpose study , score 4 23-item BCFRS consider inclusion study . 2 . Hamilton depression scale 3 . Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) The administration BFCRS , Hamilton depression scale MoCA videotape additional rating blind rater . These assessment administer ECT treatment . 12 . Labs test rule organic cause catatonia include : EEG electroencephalogram EKG - electrocardiogram CT scan head w/o contrast CMP complete metabolic panel , CBC diff complete blood count differential Thyroid study TSH T3 T4 Metabolic/Inflammatory laboratory test ( specific condition ) Urine Analysis Urine Drug Screen within 48 hour admission ) Fe serum level Fibrin D-dimer Magnesium ( Mg ) 13 . Pre-anesthesia work-up perform department anesthesia determine fitness ECT . Anesthesia faculty administer anesthesia participant ECT procedure . They monitor patient operating room ( OR ) , ECT procedure least 30 minute adverse effect . 14 . ECT treatment begin initial evaluation describe . ECT treatment administer three time week . 15 . Participants require try fail challenge Intravenous ( IV ) Intramuscular ( IM ) Lorazepam prior assign receive ECT treatment .</detailed_description>
