	<brief_title>One Stage Versus Two Stage For Periprosthetic Hip And Knee Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total joint arthroplasty ( TJA ) common successful procedure , expect become prevalent upcoming year . However , despite success , TJA associate complication , include periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) . PJI devastate complication associate marked patient morbidity mortality immense economic burden . Although rate PJI follow TJA low , burden rise exponentially due health complication treatment cost . There two common type surgical treatment use treat chronic PJI , two-stage exchange arthroplasty one-stage exchange arthroplasty . During two-stage exchange arthroplasty , implant remove , infected tissue debrided temporary antibiotic impregnate spacer fashion polymethylmethacrylate place ( stage one ) . Afterwards patient undergoes many week intravenous antibiotic , follow reimplantation later date ( stage two ) . During time first second stage revision patient often immobile , experience severe pain due lack function joint , may experience systemic toxicity associate administration antibiotic . In one stage exchange arthroplasty , infect prosthesis remove , infected tissue debrided , new prosthesis reimplanted procedure . While two-stage exchange arthroplasty prefer method treatment chronic PJI North America , one-stage exchange arthroplasty method choice Europe center report comparable result term success one-stage exchange two-stage exchange arthroplasty . However , randomize , prospective , control study date compare one-stage exchange two-stage exchange arthroplasty . Because lack comparative outcome report , perceive high rate failure one-stage exchange arthroplasty , surgeon North America prefer perform traditional two-stage exchange arthroplasty management chronic PJI . Several team succeed perform one-stage exchange arthroplasty select patient , procedure gain much popularity US . The purpose study investigate outcome one-stage two-stage exchange arthroplasty management patient chronic PJI . The hypothesis study one-stage exchange arthroplasty , perform appropriate patient population , carry similar success rate treatment chronic PJI two-stage exchange arthroplasty avoids many problem associate two-stage exchange arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
