	<brief_summary>Background : The first nuclear bomb test take place New Mexico July 1945 . This call Trinity test . Researchers want learn affect health people live New Mexico time test . To , want learn diet daily life people time . They want study Native Americans , Hispanic/Latinos , non-Hispanic/Latino white . Objective : To learn health risk people may expose radiation Trinity nuclear test . Eligibility : People : - Are Native American , Hispanic/Latino , non-Hispanic white - Are age 70 old - Lived near fallout region Trinity test know lifestyle dietary pattern New Mexico 1940s 1950s Design : Participants screen questionnaire . Participants answer question interview focus group . This place like office , tribal community center , library . It take 2 hour . The interview group session include : - Questions family member activity eat habit 1940s 1950s - A card-sorting exercise : There card picture names certain food . They sort card 2 pile : consume . - Filling chart family member food eat If participant give permission , interview group session record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Estimate Radiation Doses Cancer Risks From Radioactive Fallout From Trinity Nuclear Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last four decade , assessment health risk base estimate radiation dose receive public complete major U.S. nuclear test site nuclear fuel cycle facility U.S. except Trinity test . This research plan radiationrelated cancer risk projection study resident state New Mexico ( NM ) potentially expose radioactive fallout Trinity nuclear test conduct 1945 . Data collect diet lifestyle three main ethnic group NM ( white , Hispanic , Native American ) via focus group key informant interview use derive mean range exposure-related parameter dose assessment risk projection . As preliminary work proposal , 2014 conduct pilot study obtain information 9 key informant ( maximum number allow OMB regulation prior clearance ) determine elder could recall relevant time period relevant lifestyle practice . This work establish possible : 1 ) locate elderly representative ethnic group , 2 ) assemble group member tribal , n Hispanic/Latino communities New Mexico alive 1945 time test participate focus group , 3 ) obtain lifestyle diet information use refining focus group interviewing tool . Due successful completion pilot phase , propose second phase collect data , large scale , via focus group individual interview , lifestyle diet 150 Native American , Hispanic/Latino , non-Hispanic white participant live New Mexico alive time Trinity detonation ( currently great equal 70 year old ) . The data collect propose study allow u estimate exposure-related parameter value use fallout dose assessment model estimate external internal radiation dos representative person county New Mexico ethnicity , gender , age . Those dos use publish risk model couple literature-derived parameter risk/unit dose project excess cancer ( per 1,000 person within stratum ) expect . Endpoints leukemia , thyroid cancer , stomach cancer , colon cancer .</detailed_description>
