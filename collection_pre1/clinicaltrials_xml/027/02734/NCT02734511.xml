	<brief_summary>Relieving symptom patient hospitalize palliative care unit priority . Although receive appropriate care , may still experience pain refractory analgesia or/and conservative treatment care procedure . For instance , pain cause bandaging carcinological ischemic wound , mobilization traumatic injury specifically treat . Although types situation rare , remain unacceptable , especially end life . According current recommendation , short-term sedation treatment administer although detailed procedure type sedation much document . In reality , midalozam often used case drawback , investigator look alternative . Propofol , already widely use anesthesia emergency medicine manage painful procedure , seem interesting molecule pharmacological property . It allow quickly reach deep sedation thus obtain certain level comfort patient , also ensure prompt awaken soon care procedure , limit respiratory side effect . The result preliminary study encourage u go present prospective study conduct multiple center order evaluate efficiency safety procedural sedation administer trained doctor anesthesiologists terminally ill patient refractory pain hospitalized palliative care unit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency Safety Procedural Sedation Propofol Terminally Ill Patients With Refractory Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At end life , patient may feel pain care procedure . These painful procedure contribute patient 's overall suffering . Of course investigator take account procedure could consider futile medical care would bring comfort patient . The procedure investigator consider necessary acceptable : basic hygiene care , bandage . Even best palliative care , certain pain cause procedure refractory analgesic , Entonox conservative treatment . These pain ethically unacceptable , especially end life . In case , short-term procedural sedation could benefit patient , indicated Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament ( French Agency Safety Health Products ) . However , document recommendation way administer type sedation lack scientific study field . It therefore remain important issue palliative care research . The sedation consist transitory reduction vigilance sufficient enough patient suffer . They therefore major tool provide sufficient comfort terminally ill patient use part treatment approach . However , still drawback : patient lose contact environment also experience respiratory complication ( embarrassment , respiratory depression , inhalation ) . These risk compel investigator use sedation terminally ill patient suffer major refractory pain end life , case consider comfort absolute priority ( principle double effect ) . The decision use sedation must agree upon collegial consultation discussion patient and/or relative . The risk side effect must reduce far possible without pursue reanimation approach would go palliative approach . Sedation , originally exclusively administered anesthesiologist , use palliative care doctor many year . At first , midazolam seem best sedative agent use spread although much document context . However , midazolam limit . It provide deep sedation respiratory depressant effect patient , light sedation , often experience persistent discomfort . Moreover , midazolam require long titration period often cause sedation last several hour , thus reduce patient 's relational life increase risk congestion respiratory depression . Investigators therefore look alternative . According , propofol would suitable molecule pharmacological property . Its pharmacokinetic property allow patient quickly reach deep sedation therefore well comfort , also wake soon painful care procedure complete , thus limit risk respiratory side effect . Note already use situation procedural sedation doctor anesthesiologist ( pulmonologists , gastroenterologist , emergency doctor ) . In feasibility study , investigator point propofol could use palliative care unit transitory sedation administer anesthesiologist follow strict protocol could relieve terminally ill patient end life painful care procedure sufficiently safe way ( preliminary result present French Society Support Palliative Care conference 2015 ) . Investigators aim show procedural sedation use propofol administer palliative care doctor anesthesiologist train follow precise protocol bring relief terminally ill patient refractory pain experience care procedure without cause major side effect .</detailed_description>
