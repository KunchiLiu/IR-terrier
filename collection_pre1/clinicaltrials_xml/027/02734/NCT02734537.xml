	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well radiation therapy without cisplatin work treat patient stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck undergone surgery . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know radiation therapy effective without cisplatin treat patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Cisplatin Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck Who Have Undergone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) disruptive p53 mutation primary surgical resection follow postoperative radiotherapy ( PORT ) alone PORT concurrent cisplatin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate DFS patient stage III-IV SCCHN non-disruptive p53 mutation primary surgical resection follow PORT alone PORT concurrent cisplatin . II . To evaluate DFS patient stage III-IV SCCHN p53 wild type primary surgical resection follow PORT alone PORT concurrent cisplatin . III . To evaluate toxicity PORT alone PORT concurrent cisplatin . IV . To evaluate p53 mutation predictive biomarker survival benefit give post-operative concurrent radiation cisplatin . V. To identify potential genomic alteration addition TP53 mutation may develop novel treatment approach . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients undergo IMRT QD 5 day week receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour weekly 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year every 12 month 7 year .</detailed_description>
