	<brief_summary>This prospective , nonrandomized , single-arm study use Zilver PTXTM stent patient Superficial Femoral Artery ( SFA ) disease ( total occlusion significant stenosis ) . 20 patient enrolled claudication and/or critical limb ischemia , identifiable SFA disease angiogram require percutaneous peripheral intervention ( PPI ) . We would like study vessel apposition expansion immediately initial implantation well evaluation late stent malapposition neointimal hyperplasia 12 month follow Zilver PTXTM stent implantation use intravascular OCT imaging . Follow visit take place 1 month , 6 month , 12 month 13 month procedure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient low extremity claudication Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) due significant SFA stenosis ( 60 % ≤99 % ) total occlusion ( 100 % ) affect quality life despite medical therapy . Evidence significant SFA disease involve symptomatic limb noninvasive vascular test use following : ABI : &lt; 0.9 ( If ABI &gt; 1.4 , SFA systolic acceleration time &gt; 140 millisecond ) ; TBI : &lt; 0.6 ; Computed Tomographic Angiography ( CTA ) confirm least 60 % SFA stenosis ; Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) confirm least 60 % SFA stenosis At least one patent , nontreated knee vessel . Male female patient ≥ 18 year age . Subject advise beneficial effect smoke cessation regular exercise must process change smoke status time screen . Patients may resume increase exercise effect post procedurally improve low limb perfusion . Peak Walking Time ( PWT ) limit claudication . Willingness participate study , document sign , write informed consent . Planned usage atherectomy device procedure . The following device permit device use intervention procedure : Conventional balloon Zilver PTXTM stent Planned amputation . Any planned/scheduled revascularization procedure ≤ 30 day baseline procedure . Prior low extremity revascularization ≤ 30 day baseline procedure . The target lesion instent restenosis . Infrapopliteal disease involve last remaining vessel . Patients creatinine clearance &lt; 30mL/min . Patients know bleed disorder . Patients know active pathological bleeding . Patients know hypersensitivity acetylsalicylic acid , clopidogrel bisulfate , ticagrelor , Aspirin , antiplatelets/anticoagulants . Patients known history intracranial hemorrhage time , GI bleed past 6 month , major surgery within past 30 day . Patients know ischemic stroke past 3 month . Patients know severe liver disease . Patient known history congestive heart failure ( CHF ) LVEF &lt; 30 % . Patients consider risk bradycardic event unless treat permanent pacemaker . Female patient know pregnancy , breast feeding , intend become pregnant study period ( female patient 55 year young , without history hysterectomy must pregnancy test prior PPI baseline 12 month ) . Concern inability patient comply study procedure and/or follow ( e.g. , alcohol drug abuse ) .</criteria>
