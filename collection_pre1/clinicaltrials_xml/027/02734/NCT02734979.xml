	<brief_summary>To investigate whether addition Biobridge scaffold standard surgery vascularize lymph node transfer improve outcome surgical treatment lymphedema upper arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Biobridge Scaffold Adjunct Lymph Node Transfer Upper Extremity Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator perform lymph scan ( lymphoscintigrams ) surgery one year follow surgery determine success surgery . In addition , volume operate arm monitor repeated measurement tape measure . The investigator also track bioimpedance , painless technique detect fluid tissue . The investigator obtain small skin biopsy blood sample detect biological change may occur result successful surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The diagnosis obstructive lymphedema typically rely upon clinical presentation physical finding . All subject require present compatible history acquire lymphedema , along follow criterion : sustain , unilateral , conservativelymanaged edema upper limb , increase least 20 % measured volume affect extremity compare contralateral , normal limb . In addition , subject must evidence abnormal bioimpedance ratio ( LDex &gt; 10 unit ) . The subject must submit evidence previous , complete complex decongestive physiotherapy ongoing use appropriately sized compression garment daytime use . Ancillary use nocturnal garment and/or pneumatic compression device acceptable , necessary . The subject must eligible surgical intervention . Swelling 1 arm completely reverse arm elevation compression Stage II great lymphedema screening , base International Society Lymphology ( ISL ) stag system Completion full course complete decongestive therapy ( CDT ) , accord ISL guideline least 8 week prior screen , include use compression garment least 8 week without change regimen Willingness maintain stable regimen selfcare , include use compression garment screen entire study duration ( safety followup visit ) . Selfbandaging , use nighttime compression garment , intermittent pneumatic compression device allow , procedure regimens must remain consistent screen though entire study duration . Two consecutive measurement limb volume ( LV ) affect arm take least 1 day apart screen period must within 10 % . A maximum 3 measurement take . Willing able provide write informed consent Willing able comply study procedure , include measurement skin thickness use skin caliper inability safely undergo general anesthesia and/or perioperative care relate vascularized lymph node transfer Concurrent participation clinical trial investigational drug therapy , regardless indication , within 1 month screen 5 time drug 's halflife , whichever longer Recent initiation ( ≤8 week ) , intention initiate , CDPT maintenance physiotherapy lymphedema time duration study Other medical condition could lead acute arm edema , ( limit ) acute venous thrombosis Other medical condition could result symptom overlap lymphedema affect arm ( e.g. , pain , swell , decrease range motion ) History clot disorder ( hypercoagulable state ) Chronic ( persistent ) infection affect arm Any infection ( unrelated lymphedema ) within 1 month prior screen Current evidence malignancy Currently receive chemotherapy radiation therapy Life expectancy &lt; 2 year reason Pregnancy nursing Substance abuse ( alcohol drug abuse ) within 6 month prior screen Significant chronic renal insufficiency ( define serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL estimate glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] &lt; 30 mL/min screening ) require dialytic support Hepatic dysfunction , define alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) level &gt; 3 × upper limit normal range ( ULN ) and/or bilirubin level &gt; 2 × ULN screen Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1500 mm3 screen Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 9 g/dL screen Any reason ( addition list ) , opinion investigator , preclude full participation study</criteria>
