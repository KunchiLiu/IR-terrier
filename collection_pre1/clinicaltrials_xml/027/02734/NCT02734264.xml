	<detailed_description>Entamoeba histolytica infection result ingestion cyst Entamoeba histolytica fecally-contaminated food water . Local invasion result amebic dysentery metastasis amebic liver abscess . The diagnosis intestinal amebiasis ideally make use E. histolytica-specific stool antigen detection test use real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The two major clinical syndrome amebiasis amebic colitis amebic liver abscess . Together estimate result 50 million case colitis liver abscess 100,000 death worldwide year . In develop country , colonization E. histolytica observe 5 % poor child . Patients amebic colitis typically present several week history gradual onset abdominal pain tenderness , diarrhea bloody stool ( dysentery ) . The pathological lesion colon include ulceration intestinal epithelium invasion lamina propria trophozoite . Inflammation , infiltrate neutrophil mononuclear lymphocyte pronounce , inflammatory cell near ameba kill pyknotic nucleus characteristic apoptotic death . Amebic liver abscess rare form disease almost exclusively limited adult male . Cryptosporidiosis human cause primarily two specie , Cryptosporidium parvum C. hominis . There annually approximately 1.4 cases/100,000 United States report Centers Disease Control . Infection result ingestion fecally contaminated water food contain infectious oocyst form . Sporozoites release oocyst small intestine attach epithelial cell surface . Upon invasion epithelial cell parasite undergoes sexual asexual stage life cycle . Infection C. parvum normal host lead day several week non-bloody diarrhea . In many people E. histolytica Cryptosporidia infection resolve without symptom . A major emphasis study study host , environment , parasite factor control susceptibility E. histolytica Cryptosporidia infection disease , begin answer question infection cause disease . At time , want improve diagnostic technique diseases . This study continue cohort 420 child ( average age 10.5 year ) research team follow since birth measure incidence amebiasis cryptosporidiosis prospectively . In addition , 500 live birth enrol exist cohort . This work several objective . The first objective compare current `` gold-standard '' diagnostic technique diseases new antigen detection polymerase chain reaction technique . The second objective delineate protective role innate acquire immunity E. histolytica . The investigator hypothesize protective immunity mediate innate immune response initiate via Toll-like Receptor stimulation acquire response include mucosal immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) systemic Interferon-Î³ . Acquired immune response ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine production fecal IgA anti-cross react determinant ) amebic cryptosporidial infection disease determine child cohort . The third objective test association genetic polymorphism innate acquire immune gene incidence amebiasis . The investigator hypothesize common genetic polymorphism gene innate acquire immune system influence susceptibility E. histolytica Cryptosporidia infection disease . The final objective test role human genetic polymorphism microbiome protection undernutrition . Genome wide scan microbiome compositional analysis perform child determine nutritional status child correlate measurement .</detailed_description>
