	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy suction flexible ureteroscopy ( SF-URS ) automatic control renal pelvic pressure treatment upper urinary calculus use prospective , randomized design . Half participant receive suction flexible ureteroscopy automatic control renal pelvic pressure , half participant receive retrograde intrarenal surgery use classic flexible ureteroscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suctioning Flexible Ureteroscopy With Intelligent Control Renal Pelvic Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrograde intrarenal surgery use flexible ureteroscope become first-line treatment renal calculus &lt; 3.0 cm recommend European Association Urology due minimally-invasive nature satisfactory result . However , high perfusion rate lead renal pelvic pressure increase , result absorption liquid , bacteria , endotoxin blood , follow short-term complication systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS , 8.1 % ) , sepsis ( 0-4.5 % ) , renal pelvic ureteral tumor spread , long-term complication renal function impairment . Currently commonly use flexible ureteroscope sheath ( ureteral access sheath , UAS ) reduce renal pelvic pressure certain extent , still control monitor renal pelvic pressure reduce incidence complication , , limit clinical application ureteroscopy . Recently , investigator present novel technique SF-URS automatic control renal pelvic pressure . In study , transverse comparison design evaluate safety efficacy suction flexible ureteroscopy automatic control renal pelvic pressure treatment renal calculus .</detailed_description>
