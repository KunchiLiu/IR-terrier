	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study MEDI4736 Combination With Olaparib Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II open-label , multicenter study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) antitumor activity MEDI4736 combination olaparib patient advance solid tumor , select base rationale response olaparib . Patients poly ( adenosine diphosphate-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) -inhibitor immunotherapy ( IMT ) -naïve ( define prior exposure PARP inhibitor IMT , include , limited , anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [ CTLA-4 ] , anti-programmed cell death 1 [ PD-1 ] , anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [ PD-L1 ] monoclonal antibody , antibody drug specifically target T-cell co-stimulation checkpoint pathway ) . Initially , patient enrol concurrently 4 exploratory cohort , include patient relapsed SCLC , gBRCAm metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer , gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer , gastric cancer . Additional tumor type may add later date base emerge data . The result study form decision-making future study .</detailed_description>
