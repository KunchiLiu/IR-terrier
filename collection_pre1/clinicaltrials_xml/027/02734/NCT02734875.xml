	<brief_summary>This step wedge randomize intervention apply machine learn algorithms electronic health record system identify primary care patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( AF ) high risk stroke anticoagulation therapy . An Anticoagulant Management Service ( AMS ) offer support primary care provider regard treatment relevant patient ( either warfarin novel oral anticoagulant ) . This study seek : 1. increase proportion appropriately anticoagulated patient AF , 2. understand reason lack anticoagulation , 3. document proportion patient AF appropriately anticoagulated ( e.g . patient refusal , contraindication ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common type cardiac arrhythmia associate significant mortality morbidity stroke , thromboembolism , related cardiovascular condition . While risk stroke AF patient whole tends great general population ; within AF patient population , risk stroke modify presence absence additional risk factor age , comorbid condition , prior stroke history . There wealth evidence effectiveness anticoagulation therapy prevent stroke thromboembolism , anticoagulant demonstrate highly effective prevent stroke embolic event among AF patient , also know increase risk major bleed event . Anticoagulation warfarin VKA drug complex manage . These drug narrow therapeutic window require close monitoring stay within target international normalized ratio ( INR ) . They also many know food drug interaction . In last year , several novel oral anticoagulant ( NOAC ) dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban enter market . While NOACs demonstrate non-inferiority warfarin large randomize clinical trial prior FDA approval , experience NOACs limit practice . Our intervention combine ability health information technology filter large volume data human capacity understand subtleties barrier complex clinical decision making . Our intervention facilitate connection patient , treat clinician , establish Anticoagulant Management Service ( AMS ) coordinate care . We use information EHR direct additional effort resource toward reach potentially unrecognized undertreated atrial fibrillation patient greatest need preventive anticoagulation therapy low risk adverse effect . This electronic safety net assist efficient allocation scarce resource beyond usual care . The proposed clinical decision support/care-coordination process design address many identified barrier appropriate anticoagulation therapy among AF patient . Here define `` appropriate '' anticoagulation guideline inform share decision individual patient care team . This intervention utilize step wedge design involve 14 primary care clinic affiliate Brigham Women 's Hospital . The timing clinic entry intervention arm randomize .</detailed_description>
