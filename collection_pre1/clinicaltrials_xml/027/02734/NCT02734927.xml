Each colour require specific task give fix rule ( contextual control ) colour , rule change sometimes ( episodic control ) . Participants informed payoff vary accord performance . A frame indicate essay bonus reward . Moreover dash frame indicate low-bonus reward solid frame mean high-bonus reward . Thus different block design : low-incentive block high incentive block . This reward increase standard bonus motivation high-incentive block ( contextual motivation ) low high accord type block ( episodic motivation ) Reaction time may higher bonus reward Patients schizophrenia sensitive contextual motivation , therefore patient behave differently control contextual motivation .</detailed_description>
