	<brief_summary>Background : Schistosomiasis chronic infection . It cause parasitic worm call Schistosoma haematobium ( Sh ) spread snails live river . It lead liver problem bladder cancer . Praziquantel ( PZQ ) drug use treat infection . After take , people develop increase resistance reinfection Sh . Some people Sh infection infect another worm call Mansonella perstans ( Mp ) . Mp spread bite insect call midge . It rarely cause symptom . However , researcher think Mp infection could affect body response PZQ treatment risk reinfection Sh . Objective : To find effect Mp infection response PZQ treatment Sh infection . Eligibility : Men woman age 14-80 : - Live Tieneguebougou , Bougoudiana , surround village Mali - Are pregnant - Have Sh infection - Have chronic medical condition Design : - Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - Stool sample - Participants treat single dose PZQ mouth . - After receive PZQ , participant return clinic blood urine test follow time : - 4 , 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour later - 5 , 7 , 9 , 14 day later - 1 , 3 , 6 month later Participants infect Sh 6-month visit get another treatment PZQ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Concomitant Mansonella Perstans Microfilaremia Immune Responses Following Single Dose Praziquantel People With Schistosomiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic filarial infection associate downregulation immune response helminth non-helminth antigen . Praziquantel ( PZQ ) treatment schistosomiasis associate dramatic interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) -dependent increase eosinophilia correlate resistance reinfection . We hypothesize chronic filarial infection Mansonella perstans ( Mp ) may attenuate post-treatment eosinophilia thus impact resistance reinfection . To address first part question , plan compare post-PZQ reaction reinfection rate 20 subject schistosomiasis Mp infection 20 subject schistosomiasis evidence filarial infection area coendemic infection Mali . Signs symptom , complete blood count , intracellular serum cytokine level , marker eosinophil activation assess baseline , 4 8 hour , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 14 day post-treatment compare two treatment group . Schistosoma haematobium reinfection rate also compare 1 , 3 , 6 month post-treatment .</detailed_description>

However , married woman age 14 17 sign consent adult view law govern emancipation woman Mali . Subjects participate study receive PZQ part national schistosomiasis control program . Participation Women : Pregnancy : The effect praziquantel develop human fetus unknown ( pregnancy category B ) . For reason , female childbearingage must negative pregnancy test result prior receive praziquantel . Since halflife praziquantel short ( 34 hour ) , contraceptive measure require posttreatment . Breast feeding : Praziquantel know present breast milk 3 day follow single dose approve use child age 4 year . Consequently , woman ask suspend breastfeeding treatment PZQ 3 day . Formula provide breastfed child affect mother participation time ensure adequate nutrition . Depending age child , formula may give .
