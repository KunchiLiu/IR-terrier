	<criteria>Must histologic cytologic confirmation recurrent metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma base standard diagnostic criterion . Recurrence must document diagnostic biopsy . Have measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) version 1.1 . Have disease progression , refractory intolerant 2 prior systemic regimen locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . Participants receive prior neoadjuvant therapy metastatic disease must receive 1 follow metastatic disease : FOLFIRINOX , nanoparticle albuminbound paclitaxel/gemcitabine , TS1 ( tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium ) , irinotecan liposome injection/5fluorouracil ( 5FU ) /Leucovorin singleagent gemcitabine prior enrolment study . Dose Escalation : Able willing give valid write consent undergo new tumour biopsy ( prior study treatment ) provide available archival tumour sample take &lt; 3 year prior enrolment new tumour biopsy feasible acceptable clinical risk . Cohort Expansion : Able willing give valid write consent undergo new tumour biopsy ( prior study treatment ) . Able willing undergo second tumour biopsy treatment . Where possible , tumour lesion use new biopsy lesion use RECIST target lesion , unless lesion suitable biopsy . Archival sample may require inadequate tissue biopsy specimen . Have adequate organ function . Have performance status 0 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale . Use approve contraceptive method . Have moderate severe cardiovascular disease : Have presence cardiac disease , include myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , unstable angina pectoris , New York Heart Association Class III/IV congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension . Have document major electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality ( respond medical treatment ; example , atrial fibrillation , bundle branch block , approve sponsor ) . Have major abnormality document ECHO Doppler ( example , moderate severe heart valve function defect include moderate severe valve stenosis regurgitation , leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % , evaluation base institutional low limit normal , septal aneurysm heart aneurysm , aneurysm major vessel condition result increase risk aneurysm ( eg , Marfan syndrome , patent foramen ovale [ PFO ] ) . Have predispose condition consistent development aneurysm ascend aorta aortic stress ( example , family history aneurysm , Marfan syndrome , PFO , bicuspid aortic valve , evidence damage large vessel heart document computerized tomography [ CT ] scan contrast magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) . Have evidence interstitial lung disease symptomatic may interfere detection management suspect drugrelated pulmonary toxicity active , noninfectious pneumonitis .</criteria>
