	<brief_summary>Essential hypertension complex trait result interaction environmental factor genetic factor . The aim study investigate effect interaction environmental factor genetic factor long-term blood pressure ( BP ) base two establish cohort include `` cohort Hanzhong adolescent hypertension study '' `` cohort Mei county adult salt-sensitive hypertension study '' . Firstly , Hanzhong cohort-based follow-up study design observe track BP whole life time , explore effect many risk factor ( salt-sensitivity , obesity et al ) long-term BP occurrence hypertension , also analyze relationship different polymorphism sodium potassium metabolism-related gene BP change target organ damage . In addition , use DNA sample collect subject `` Mei county adult salt-sensitive hypertension study '' participant complete chronic salt load potassium intervention trial , attempt examine single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) sodium potassium metabolism-related gene , well relationship SNPs BP responses dietary sodium/potassium intervention , long-term BP change , risk hypertension target organ damage analyze . This study would enable u explore etiology essential hypertension well identify new genetic marker predict early hypertension target organ damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Follow-up Study Two Chinese Cohorts ( C-BPCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study longitudinal cohort follow-up study . The main content include : ( 1 ) Questionnaire design : questionnaire design accord research content purpose . The standard questionnaire use collect general information , dietary habit , lifestyle , medical history family history etc . ( 2 ) Anthropometric measurement : blood pressure , height , body weight , waist hip , pulse acquire medical practitioner receive professional training base World Health Organization ( WHO ) standard , pass relevant examination . ( 3 ) Blood urine sample collection : morning fasting blood , nocturia , 24-hour urine specimen collect medical staff , blind tubes set accord 5 % total sample . Blood biochemistry include serum total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglyceride , fast glucose , creatinine hsCRP measure use automatic biochemical analyzer . The sodium potassium concentration urine measure flame photometry . The total sodium potassium excretion urine 24h calculated multiply concentration 24-h volume urine . ( 4 ) Auxiliary examination : Auxiliary examination include carotid intima-media thickness , endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( FMD ) , measurements brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity ( baPWV ) electrocardiographic parameter . The measurement do hospital medical practitioner receive professional training pass relevant examination . ( 5 ) Single nucleotide polymorphisms detection : base previous study , sodium potassium metabolism-related gene polymorphism detect use MassARRAY technology . ( 6 ) Data process statistic : input data database , utilize software SPSS , STATA , Haploview FBAT analyze . ( 7 ) Quality control : ① Questionnaire strictly design amended epidemiologist clinical expert . ② A standardized `` Investigator Handbook '' stipulate accord guideline . ③ Staff member require rigorous train pas exam . ④ The investigation process strictly supervise principal investigator . ⑤ Data entry use parallel double entry method . ⑥ During laboratory testing , blank control blind detection apply ensure quality . ⑦ Data analysis perform 2-3 postgraduate , inconsistent data need double check .</detailed_description>
