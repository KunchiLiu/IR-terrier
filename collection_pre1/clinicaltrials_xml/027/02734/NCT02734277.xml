	<brief_title>Type 1 Diabetes Extension Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) autoimmune disease . This mean immune system ( part body help fight infection ) mistakenly attack cell produce insulin ( beta cell pancreas ) . As beta cell destroy immune cell , ability produce insulin decrease diabetes develops . Insulin help keep blood glucose level normal . People diabetes ability produce insulin ( even though still need take insulin ) may able achieve good glucose control people produce insulin . Better glucose control show reduce long-term complication diabetes . Several Immune Tolerance Network ( ITN ) drug treatment study complete show participant new onset T1DM partial disease remission therapy . Prior participant trial , measure insulin secretion , six month interval , two year diabetes diagnosis . It unclear , however , intervention produce continue disease remission patient . For person complete drug treatment trial , long term follow-up important continue evaluation effect therapy insulin production .</detailed_description>
