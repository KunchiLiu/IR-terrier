	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) condition cause cartilage loss , bony remodeling , joint stiffness generalize muscle weakness . 90 % OA presentation report within leg ; 44 % affect knee joint . Knee OA expect increase 50 % next twenty year due age population , obesity , societal trend lack activity . Only 13 % knee OA sufferer reach recommended level exercise therefore understanding psychological functional relationship effect exercise engagement , turn would provide comprehensive rehabilitation programme patient knee OA . The aim study investigate exercise knee OA 's correlation fear movement , use mixed method approach . Quantitative methodology investigate low limb exercise pain function fear movement . The desired outcome study show reduction pain patient specific exercise also reduce fear movement allow patient self-manage symptom without fear . Other quantitative factor intensity exercise postural stabilization use Y balance test also utilized review functional relationship muscle strength balance kinesiophobia . A semi-structured interview complete end course treatment highlight patient think exercise intervention . Participants age forty-five specific clinical symptom invite study ask attend eight exercise session within class environment , last 1 hour within Physiotherapy Department .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise recommend treatment knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) muscle strength aerobic exercise improve physical function . There evidence support quadriceps strength patient painful knee OA ; positive effect pain ; general fitness . Research review suggest exercise important aspect rehabilitation knee OA . However , limited evidence type exercise actually decrease pain improve activity . Despite positive evidence regard exercise , highlight major issue within United Kingdom 5 % people knee OA achieve recommend level activity 57 % population complete regular exercise . 1 % 4 % total healthcare cost account physical inactivity cost 8.3 billion 2009 . An essential factor physical inactivity exercise behaviour . Fear movement important aspect knee OA . Disability present due individual 's fear physical movement would cause pain . Evidence link fear movement knee OA role exercise management knee OA . Patients OA experience pain activity , lead expectation activity , cause great pain therefore increase muscle weakness . It indicate individual could negative attitude beliefs knee problem , could cause barrier treatment , socioeconomic , personality environmental factor important physical characteristic . Other factor balance issue laxity knee associate activity limitation . However , systematic review find weak evidence support pain , distress , avoidance activity participant knee OA . Understanding individual exercise behaviour habit essential improve exercise adherence . Non-compliance common within physiotherapy patient unwilling accommodate exercise within everyday life . Reasons may include type exercise , dosage , underlie belief clinician towards exercise well external factor . Incorrect prescription exercise lead increase pain , decrease function decrease exercise adherence . This could cause fear movement whilst complete exercise . It conclude OA limit evidence intervention improve exercise adherence . Therefore , understand non-adherence effect kinesiophobia essential develop exercise program patient OA .</detailed_description>
