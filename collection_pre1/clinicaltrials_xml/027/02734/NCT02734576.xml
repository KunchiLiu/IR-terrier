	<brief_summary>There publish study examine efficacy safety endovascular treatment patient pulsatile tinnitus venous stenosis . Despite limited experience venous sinus stenting treat pulsatile tinnitus , preliminary result show venous sinus stenting could represent viable alternative refractory pulsatile tinnitus patient venous sinus stenosis . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy procedure control fashion , use strict inclusion exclusion criterion , long-term clinical image follow-up . The investigator hope provide robust data regard safety efficacy venous sinus stenting patient pulsatile tinnitus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Venous Sinus Stenting To Treat Intractable Pulsatile Tinnitus Caused By Venous Sinus Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY ? A . Screening process - experimental : Patients pulsatile tinnitus , evidence narrow large vein brain , failure prior conservative treatment consider enrollment . All patient undergo standard care evaluation tinnitus specialist physician disease ear ( Ear , Nose Throat [ ENT ] physician otorhinolaryngologist ) . If determine narrow large vein brain ( `` dural venous sinus '' ) likely etiology tinnitus , possibility enrollment trial discuss . Imaging study head temporal bone perform order confirm venous sinus stenosis etiology pulsatile tinnitus rule possible cause . Additionally , patient answer question list Tinnitus Handicap Inventory questionnaire . During screen process , review result test experimental perform part routine care . In word , test perform regardless participation study term `` standard procedure '' . B . Participating study : Participating trial mean participant undergo experimental procedure call `` venous sinus stenting '' open narrow vein cause tinnitus . This procedure require take two blood thinner call aspirin Plavix . Both blood thinner initiate 1 week prior procedure continue 1 month procedure . At time Plavix stop aspirin continued 11 month ( total 12 month ) . - Direct Retrograde Cerebral Venography ( DRCV ) Manometry : A DRCV non-experimental procedure look vein brain . This procedure do insert catheter ( soft plastic tube ) vein groin ( upper leg ) guide though vein way neck . It do local anesthetic moderate sedation . After place catheter neck , special dye ( contrast ) inject catheter vein , X-ray camera take multiple picture vein . Then , small catheter advance area narrow catheter measure blood pressure point . This help u identify severity narrow . If pressure narrow significantly different , continue placement stent order reopen narrowing . - Venous Sinus Stenting ( experimental ) : Venous sinus stenting experimental procedure test protocol consist place stent narrow vein brain . The participant place general anesthesia important move procedure . A catheter insert upper part leg ( groin area ) guide vein way neck . Then , balloon advance catheter position across stenosis . The balloon carefully inflate second . This process call angioplasty partially re-open narrowing , make placement stent easier . The balloon remove stent advance catheter neck across stenosis carefully deploy . - Post-procedure Care : After procedure , stay intensive care unit 24 hour observation . C. Follow-up period : There experimental procedure test follow-up period . The following office visit standard test perform evaluate effect study intervention . - Office visit : Office visit neurological evaluation perform 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month study intervention . At time , patient also fill Tinnitus Handicap Inventory Questionnaire . The visit 45min . - Audiometric assessment : An audiometric assessment perform 3 month stenting procedure order ass inner ear function . - Non-invasive imaging study : Magnetic Resonance Venogram ( MRV ) special Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan injection dye vein arm allow u check whether stent still open without new narrowing . It perform 12 month venous sinus stenting procedure . If clinical concern stent patency , expedite intermediate MRV perform . If MRV contraindicate , Computed Tomographic Venogram ( CTV ) perform instead . D. Medications : For purpose study , participant need take antiplatelet drug ( `` blood thinner '' ) necessary prevent formation clot stent . This standard precaution every stent procedure . The participant take two drug ( call aspirin Plavix ) 1 month aspirin alone 11 month ( total time aspirin 12 month ) . It essential drug take every day prescribe . As drug dangerous pregnancy , participant woman childbearing age , discuss issue physician , avoid become pregnant 12 month need drug .</detailed_description>
