	<brief_title>The Study ELEctronic Cigarette Toxicity Human Model Vivo Model Inflammation Vascular Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Since introduction , electronic cigarette ( EC ) use increase substantially . Perhaps concern increase use amongst adolescent . Many e-cigarette user believe electronic cigarette safer conventional cigarette [ 1 ] . However , toxicities electronic cigarette , include lung , relatively poorly study . Notably , early study suggest electronic cigarette harmless . The fine ultra-fine particle could deposit lung lead harm . Animal study electronic cigarette associate number pulmonary toxicity , include increase inflammation oxidative stress lung [ 2 ] well impair pulmonary immunity [ 3 , 4 ] . EC vapour reduces indoor air quality increase concentration particulate matter , particle number concentration , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) know carcinogen [ 5 ] . Early study cardiovascular function also suggest harm constituent EC vapour direct effect nicotine , carbonyl well fine ultrafine particle [ 6 ] . There limited understanding adverse effect EC vapour pulmonary cardiovascular physiology additional study , particularly human , need well characterize acute toxicity electronic cigarette Hypothesis Our hypothesis , compare cigarette e-cigarette naïve healthy volunteer ; 1 . E-cigarette user higher baseline pulmonary inflammation 2 . E-cigarette user exaggerate immune response LPS inhalation 3 . E-cigarettes user endothelial dysfunction measure FMD brachial artery Trial design Prospective cohort study healthy subject expose inhaled LPS . Population Healthy subject , include electronic cigarette user , cigarette smoker control recruit advertising . Intervention Bronchoscopy blood sample assess baseline pulmonary systemic inflammation injury response inhale LPS 50 mcg . Flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) brachial artery study endothelial dysfunction . After informed consent , baseline FMD brachial artery measure well lung function . FMD brachial artery measure within 5 min use e-cigarette reflect acute effect e-cigarette systemic endothelial dysfunction . Bronchoscopy BAL , blood urine sampling perform . This enable u measure baseline inflammation marker cellular injury without inhaled LPS . At 24 hour subject return lung function measure blood sampling perform . Six week later , procedure repeat LPS stimulation . The subject attend hospital lung function measure , blood urine sampling perform . Subjects inhale LPS ( Escherichia coli O26 : B6 , 50 μg ; Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , MO ) use dosimeter . Bronchoscopy BAL undertake 6 hour follow LPS inhalation . Prior bronchoscopy , lung function measure order ensure may safely undergo LPS inhalation . At 24 hour subject return lung function measure blood sampling perform . The time point BAL plasma sample choose obtain insight cytokine/chemokine release neutrophil recruitment pulmonary delivery LPS . Statistical consideration The primary exposure variable e-cigarette exposure ; primary outcome variable plasma BAL biomarkers injury inflammation . Given early study electronic cigarette suggest may associate inflammation , use BAL absolute neutrophil count , key marker inflammation , inform sample size . Based data control prior study , cohort 10 e-cigarette user 10 control able detect minimal difference 7.09 x 105 cell BAL LPS inhalation group 80 % power use Wilcoxon Rank Sum test . Of note , similar difference observe smoker non-smokers LPS prior study [ 7 ] . Additionally , compare biomarkers inflammation injury electronic cigarette user conventional cigarette smoker use Wilcoxon Rank Sum test . All data analyse use STATA 13.1 ( StataCorp LP , College Station , TX ) . Study Monitoring Site monitoring direct sponsor accord study risk assessment . Site visit perform regular basis require sponsor ensure regulatory requirement meet monitor quality data collect . The CRF use source data verification .</detailed_description>
