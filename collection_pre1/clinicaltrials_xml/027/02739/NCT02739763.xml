	<brief_title>Controlled Human Malaria Infection Semi-Immune Kenyan Adults . ( CHMI-SIKA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria remain major public health threat despite regulatory approval partially effective pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine . There urgent need accelerate development effective multi-stage vaccine . Controlled human malaria infection ( CHMI ) show important tool assessment efficacy novel malaria vaccine drug prior field trial . CHMI also allow evaluation immunity malaria parasite growth rate vivo . This particularly useful individual endemic area level exposure immunity malaria . Thus CHMI individual prior exposure malaria could valuable tool accelerate malaria vaccine development . In study , investigator aim use CHMI semi-immune adult provide comprehensive prioritization antigen associate blood-stage immunity vaccine development . The investigator comprehensively characterize immunity malaria use &gt; 100 antigen 2,000 semi-immune adult , know area malaria endemicity Kenya , select 200 individual range different immunological profile , conduct CHMI study serial quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) measure parasite growth rate vivo relate host immunity . This also involve analyse relationship functional immunity assess laboratory assay .</detailed_description>

Examples include : combined oral contraceptive ; injectable progestogen ; implant etenogestrel levonorgestrel ; intrauterine device intrauterine system ; male partner sterilisation least 6 month prior female subject 's entry study , relationship monogamous ; male condom combine vaginal spermicide ( foam , gel , film , cream suppository ) ; male condom combine female diaphragm , either without vaginal spermicide ( foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ) . Use systemic antibiotic know antimalarial activity within 30 day administration PfSPZ Challenge ( e.g . trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , doxycycline , tetracycline , clindamycin , erythromycin , fluoroquinolones azithromycin ) . Receipt investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan receipt study period . Current participation another clinical trial recent participation within 12 week enrolment . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . Use immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month prior enrolment . Any serious medical condition report identified screening increase risk CHMI . Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test , urinalysis clinical examination . Women ; pregnancy , intention become pregnant duration study . Confirmed parasite positive PCR day challenge i.e . C1 . Exclusion Criterion Day Challenge : • Acute disease , define moderate severe illness without fever ( temperature &gt; 37.5°C ) .</criteria>
