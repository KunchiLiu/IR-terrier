	<brief_summary>Endoscopic treatment pancreatic necrosis complicate trans digestive track ( duodenal gastric ) become standard technique validate . The rate high technical clinical success ( 76 91 % 3 month ) low morbidity literature explain validation . However treatment do cost high median number treatment session ( 4-5 ) explain prolonged hospitalization , delay rehabilitation potentially high cost . The constant improvement therapeutic endoscopy equipment allow see advent metal prosthesis completely cover membrane allow endoscopic extraction ease . It thus recently develop short prosthesis , large diameter ( 15/16 mm ) , broad flange ( stent `` diabolo '' ) consider use drainage digestive peri collection . Few study respectively determine effectiveness type prosthesis drainage peri digestive collection Under echo endoscopy treatment necrosis pancreatic origin . The purpose work evaluate multicenter prospective clinical technical efficiency lay completely cover stent `` diabolo '' echo endoscopy treatment necrosis pancreatic origin .</brief_summary>
