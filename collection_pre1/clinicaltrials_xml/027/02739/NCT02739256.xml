	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine normal bladder function ( ability empty bladder spontaneous urination ) surgical repair pelvic organ prolapse return faster patient retrograde void trial day surgery versus patient retrograde void trial postoperative day one . Half participant void trial 4 hour surgery , half void trial postoperative day one .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Voiding Trials After Prolapse Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overnight indwell catheterization prevalent practice surgical repair pelvic organ prolapse . A void trial perform postoperative day one determine urinary retention abnormal bladder function exist . A significant number patient range 26-47 % require continued catheterization post-op urinary retention order avoid injury associate distention bladder ureteral reflux . This study aim explore strategy reduce length catheterization post-operatively test bladder closer interval surgery . An early void trial may improve patient perioperative satisfaction decrease catheter associate urinary tract infection . Additional benefit may also see early first ambulation quicker achievement post-op discharge milestone ( pain control , ambulation symptom , oral intake tolerance completion void trial ) . To date , study attempt day surgery void trial patient admit repair pelvic organ prolapse require overnight admission .</detailed_description>
