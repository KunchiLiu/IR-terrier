	<detailed_description>After severe burn ( ≥ 30 % total body surface area [ TBSA ] burn , patient enter persistent extensive hypermetabolic catabolic state . Unfortunately , burn-induced muscle catabolism exacerbate prolonged bed rest inactivity accompany hospitalization , leading loss muscle mass extreme weakness . The persistence weakness , fatigue , muscle catabolism prolong bed rest inactivity acute care stage ultimately delay rehabilitation return normal physical activity . Studies conduct non-burn patient show , aside decrease muscle mass , prolong bed rest host negative physiological consequence . The primary purpose randomize , control , multicenter study conduct determine efficacy early in-patient exercise , use adjunct standard care ( SOC ) , improve recovery adult burn . The secondary purpose ass efficacy personalize , structure , quantifiable exercise program ( hereafter refer MP10 ) carry soon admission hospital discharge ( include BICU stay time ventilation ) . This objective met multicenter trial child adult ( 7 - 60 year ) ≥30 % TBSA burn . Outcome variable include BICU day , ventilator day , hospital day , peak treadmill time , lean body mass psychosocial function ( See Section 8 detail ) . Methods : Ninety-six subject recruit four site ( 24 subject ) study gender ethnicity invite . All subject TBSA &gt; 30 % age 7-60 year age . The first objective multicenter study characterize SOC related physical/occupational therapy inpatient four U.S. burn center , 25 question survey . The second portion project involve exercise research . The objective ass efficacy MP10 , conjunction exist SOC , reduce debilitation among discharged burn patient . This initiated follow surgeon 's prescription , roughly 3-5 day follow first surgery admission . Ergonomic exercise train in-patient subject conduct use Leg Arm Ergometer equipment , train period daily 10 minute . The duration duration patient hold Burn Intensive Care Unit ( BICU ) . Testing include follow : Lean mass ( assessed via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , Cardiopulmonary muscle endurance test ( peak VO2 treadmill test ) , weekly 6 minute walk test . Data Analysis : A repeated measure ANOVA calculate use lean body mass peak VO2 dependent variable independent variable TBA % , duration hospital stay ( day ergonomic exercise ) , ventilator day , demographic . The purpose study measure efficacy exercise training BICU thermal injury patient .</detailed_description>
