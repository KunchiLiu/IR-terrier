	<brief_title>Assessment Tecfidera® Radiologically Isolated Syndrome ( RIS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double-blinded study approximately 210 RIS ( radiologically isolate syndrome ) subject treat either Tecfidera placebo 2 year ( 1:1 randomization ) . Study participant , along treat examine physician , blind treatment assignment . Central Clinical Imaging Units screen potential study subject inclusion/exclusion criterion . We expect enroll RIS subject within U.S . Following informed consent verification entry criterion core unit , study participant randomize 1:1 either Tecfidera ( 120mg mouth twice daily 7 day dose escalation 240mg mouth twice daily ) placebo . Clinical follow-up treating physician occur week 0 , 48 , 96 . During clinical visit , comprehensive medical history data obtain treat physician . Clinical examination define within protocol perform week 0 , 48 , 96 immediately follow clinical exacerbation . All report acute progressive clinical event adjudicated Central Clinical Unit . Clinical visit due suspect exacerbation associate CNS ( central nervous system ) demyelination , associate diagnostic study treatment , cover medical standard care third party payer . A recommendation re-evaluate patient within 3 month follow clinical event ass extent recovery make . In addition face-to-face visit describe , study participant contact telephone week 4 , 8 , 36 , 60 , 84 assess medical treatment difficulty study medication compliance . Standardized MRI study brain perform week 0 96 . Clinical imaging study brain and/or spinal cord perform immediately follow onset clinical exacerbation perform discretion site PI scan cost cover medical standard care . An end study clinical MRI cervical spinal cord without contrast recommend study participant week 96 medical standard care .</detailed_description>
