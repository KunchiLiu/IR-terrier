	<brief_summary>Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) associate bone change high fracture rate . A component bone marrow . Bone marrow fat increase patient CKD compare normal population age . It clear change marrow fact content CKD Pioglitazone . In people normal kidney function , thiazolidinedione group drug variable effect bone marrow fat content , measure MRS . This important change marrow fat likely relate change bone patient chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient consent participate ancillary study marrow fat change pioglitazone , randomize placebo 15 mg pioglitazone 12 month ( per criterion main study ) also undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) lumbar spine L1 , L2 L3 . MR spectroscopy lumbar spine ( choose ancillary study ) perform 3 time course study .</detailed_description>
