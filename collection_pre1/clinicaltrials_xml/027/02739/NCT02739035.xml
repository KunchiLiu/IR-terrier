	<brief_title>MUA Treat Postoperative Stiffness After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stiffness potential complication follow Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) . While variety factor cite possible cause , component malrotation improper soft-tissue balancing , however , etiology always appreciate . Histologic arthroscopic evidence fibrosis suggest inflammatory process may contribute loss knee range motion follow surgery . Manipulation anesthesia remain standard care stiffness follow TKA . Manipulation show improve range motion stiffness total knee arthroplasty , however , patient always achieve full range motion . Furthermore , repeat manipulation manipulation great 8 week post-surgically show limited improvement . Given possible role host inflammatory response importance early gain knee range motion follow total knee arthroplasty , limit inflammatory response time manipulation may improve outcome . Investigators would like assess role anti-inflammatory medication optimize range motion outcome manipulation anesthesia stiffness follow TKA .</detailed_description>
