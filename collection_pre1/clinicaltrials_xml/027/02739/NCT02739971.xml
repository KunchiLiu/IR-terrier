	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether dietary intake pre-formed advanced glycation end product ( AGEs ) modulate brain function measure MRI ) cognitive function measure thorough neuropsychological battery . In 6 month randomize parallel study adult age 65 , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) type 2 diabetes . The investigator compare two group number 60 subject . Both group advise diet appropriate type 2 diabetes elderly nutritionist . In addition , intervention group instruct cook low-AGE diet , aim achieve 40-50 % low AGE content , closely follow throughout study ensure compliance . Since diet modifiable lifestyle , diminish AGEs consumption cook low temperature ( high cooking temperature associate high AGE production ) may simple non-invasive intervention potential delay prevent cognitive decline associate dementia .</brief_summary>
