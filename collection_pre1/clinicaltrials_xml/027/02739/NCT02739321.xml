	<brief_summary>The purpose present study evaluate tolerability efficacy Sound To Sleep System™ improve sleep quality child Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . The Sound To Sleep System™ mattress foundation design improve sleep quality individual ASD sleep disturbance provide mattress vibration accompany sync auditory stimulation . For present study , primary objective follow : * SA1 - To determine whether use Sound To Sleep System™ ASD-affected child sleep disturbance well tolerate define group drop-out proportion due issue mattress technology . The study also explore follow objective : - SA2 - To determine efficacy Sound To Sleep System™ improve sleep quality measure parent report sleep quality ASD-affected child sleep disturbance . ( Please note SA2 change clinician-rated parent-rated able collect clinician-rated sleep quality information ) . - SA3 - To determine tolerability Sound To Sleep System™ define study drop-out due reason caregiver rating ease mattress technology use . - SA4 - To determine whether use mattress technology improve function define secondary outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study aim evaluate tolerability efficacy new mattress technology improve sleep quality child Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Clinical population study indicate child ASD exhibit elevate rate sleep disturbance compare typically-developing peer 50 % 80 % child ASD sleep problem . Sleep disturbance include bedtime resistance , sleep onset latency , nighttime awakening , decrease total sleep time , early morning awakening , measure sleep quality . Sleep problem child ASD associate great externalize internalize behavior problem wake day , poor adaptive functioning , cause significant parental stress . Previous study examine effectiveness behavioral treatment , environmental modification , melatonin , psychopharmacologic treatment decrease rate sleep disturbance . However , none approach identify treatment effective ASD-affected child sleep difficulty . Given high prevalence sleep disturbance population , great need identify additional treatment may improve sleep child ASD . The purpose present study evaluate tolerability efficacy Sound To Sleep System™ use single blind ( actigraphy score blind ) , cross-over design . The Sound To Sleep System™ mattress foundation design improve sleep quality individual ASD sleep disturbance provide mattress vibration accompany sync auditory stimulation . For present study , primary objective follow : SA1 - To determine whether use Sound To Sleep System™ ASD-affected child sleep disturbance well tolerate define group drop-out proportion due issue mattress technology . The study also explore follow objective : SA2 - To determine efficacy Sound To Sleep System™ improve parent-reported sleep quality ASD-affected child sleep disturbance . SA3 - To determine tolerability Sound To Sleep System™ define study drop-out due reason caregiver rating ease mattress technology use . SA4 - To determine whether use mattress technology improve function define secondary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
