	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) lead reason ICU admission immunocompromised patient . Usual oxygen therapy involve administer low-to-medium oxygen flow nasal cannula mask [ without bag without Venturi system ] achieve SpO2≥95 % . Oxygen therapy may combine non-invasive ventilation [ NIV ] provide end-expiratory positive pressure pressure support . However , recent trial group , non-invasive ventialtion [ NIV ] superior oxygen without NIV . High-flow nasal oxygen [ HFNO ] therapy focus grow attention alternative standard oxygen therapy . By provide warm humidified gas , HFNO allow delivery high flow rate [ 60 L/min ] via nasal cannula device , Fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) value nearly 100 % . Physiological benefit HFNO consist high constant FiO2 value , decrease work breathing , nasopharyngeal washout lead improved breathing-effort efficiency , high positive airway pressure associate well lung recruitment . Clinical consequence physiological benefit include alleviation dyspnoea discomfort , decrease tachypnoea sign respiratory distress , diminish need intubation patient severe hypoxemia , decrease mortality unselected patient acute hypoxemic respiratory failure However , although preliminary data establish feasibility safety technique , HFNO never properly evaluate immunocompromised patient . Thus , project aim demonstrate HFNO superior low/medium-flow ( standard ) oxygen , minimise day-28 mortality</brief_summary>
