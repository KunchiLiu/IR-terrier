	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate Sentimag/Sienna+ System ( Sentimag® ) clinical routine practice . On one hand allow evaluation equivalence two technique . On hand ensures patient experience possible disadvantage participate . The hypothesis behind evaluation Sentimag efficient conventional sentinel node mapping . The programme compare Sentimag® conventional sentinel lymph node detection radioactive tracer combine blue dye ( centre use combined technique ) thereby determine whether new technique equivalent standard technique SLNB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) standard technique use breast cancer patient clinically radiologically negative axilla . SLNB breast cancer introduce 1990s3 significantly reduces morbidity associate axillary node dissection ( ALND ) include lymphedema , seroma , numbness , wound infection , reduce shoulder motility , chronic pain.2 The gold standard sentinel node detection 'combined technique ' ; use blue dye radioisotope injection . After allow radioisotope blue dye localize lymphatic system , clinician us 'gamma probe ' ( handheld scintillation counter ) locate SLNs . The blue dye assist localisation post-incision , lymph node blue and/or radioactive judge 'SLNs ' excise . Some centre use either radioisotope blue dye alone . Although detection rate low , still reach satisfy value experience centre . The use radioisotope expose patient healthcare worker radiation , heavily control legislation ( specific training operator subsequent disposal surgical waste ) , provide poor pre-operative imaging . As result , many centre stop undertake routine pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy . There thus clinical need develop new technique detect sentinel node without drawback .</detailed_description>
