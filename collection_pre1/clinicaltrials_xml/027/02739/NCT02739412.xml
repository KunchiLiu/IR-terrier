	<brief_summary>A common complication organ transplantation 'rejection ' transplanted organ . This occur body 's immune system try attack ( reject ) transplant organ . Drugs known immunosuppressant ( anti-rejection medication ) prescribe patient transplantation prevent rejection . But , anti-rejection medication associate significant side effect include high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high cholesterol - may increase risk heart vascular complication . Anti-rejection medication also increase long-term risk type cancer . Sometimes , liver transplant patient stop take anti-rejection medication experience rejection transplant liver liver keep work . These patient say `` tolerate '' transplant liver , condition refer `` tolerance '' . Doctors work learn liver transplant patient develop tolerance receive transplant , others . Studies show patient develop `` tolerance '' increase type immune cell call regulatory T-cells `` Tregs '' . This mean Tregs may important prevent rejection transplant organ . Studies also show human cytokine ( type protein ) , call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) aid increase number Treg cell body , IL-2 give patient successfully treat disorder immune system graft v host disease - serious condition sometimes see patient bone marrow transplantation . The purpose investigation study low dose IL-2 , give liver transplant patient subcutaneous ( skin ) injection , 4 week period time , cause increase number Treg cell blood . In addition , investigator learn kind side effect low dose IL-2 cause severe side effect .</brief_summary>
