	<brief_summary>No consensus exist among biomedical journal subject blind peer review process . Some journal attempt remove identifier authorship potential manuscript deliver referee peer review others prefer leave authorship transparent . Although peer review remain gold standard manuscript evaluation , lack standardize blind process editorial office may source publication bias make comparison manuscript publish different journal difficult interpret . Proponents blind peer review system believe knowledge authorship may leave referee vulnerable bias author ' previous research , perceive expertise , institution , nationality , gender . This shifts judgment away merit scientific work introduces pre-conceived notion identity background author review process . Conversely , supporter transparent authorship argue knowledge author identity make easy referee provide appropriate critique . Open author identification allow referee compare current manuscript previously publish work author , recognize identify potentially important conflict interest . The investigator therefore propose experimental study address question whether blind affect likelihood reviewer recommend acceptance study peer review . The investigator plan work partnership journal fabricate manuscript peer review large number reviewer ; author send `` test '' manuscript either blind form ( author ' names/institutions show reviewer ) open form , names several well-known , well-regarded author institution visible peer reviewer . The manuscript otherwise identical . The partner journal , Clinical Orthopaedics Related Research allow open blind peer review , regularly employ approach ( author choose kind review prefer submit CORR ) , reviewer unlikely troubled see manuscript either format . The primary goal study determine whether identification manuscript prominent group author ( open authorship ) affect likelihood reviewer recommend manuscript publication . Additionally , investigator plan purposely place several error manuscript , tally often reviewers detect mistake , determine whether reviewer read work prominent author less critically . The investigator also compare reviewer ' grading ( identical ) method section , determine whether identification manuscript prominent author result high reviewer grade methodological rigor . This study test follow specific hypothesis : 1 . The visibility prominent author name institution test manuscript associate increase likelihood manuscript recommend publication peer reviewer . ( Primary Study Endpoint ) 2 . The visibility prominent author name institution associate decreased likelihood purposefully place `` error '' experimental manuscript detect reviewer . 3 . The visibility prominent author name institution associate increased score give reviewer method section , despite fact method section experimental manuscript identical . NOTE : All element research protocol approve University Washington Human Subjects Review Committee , include study 's opt-out design reviewer recruitment , since consider important reviewer know paper evaluate part study . To minimize potential harm , author choose topic fabricate test manuscript intervention could immediately put practice reviewer ' center ( particular team-training process operate room ) . In addition , participate reviewer informed paper test manuscript completion data collection , pursue sort team training base result fabricate study . To reduce risk observer ( Hawthorne ) effect , important minimize likelihood participant reviewer would learn study progress . To end , investigator elect pre-register study trial registry .</brief_summary>
