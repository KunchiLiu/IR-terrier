	<brief_summary>The aim research use control laboratory set determine whether bacteria isolate kidney stone patient play role formation non-infectious kidney stone . It well know struvite stone associate active bacterial infection , however role bacteria formation non-infection stone ( like calcium oxalate ) well characterized theory bacteria involve making stone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bacterial Analysis Kidney Stones Removed Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney stone disease common , affect nearly 10 % population increase prevalence increase cost associate treat disease . While struvite stone ( composed magnesium , ammonium phosphate crystal ) associate presence infection , association bacteria non-infection stone well characterize . Previous study find bacteria present stone patient without active infection negative pre-operative urine test . There various composition kidney stone , include calcium oxalate , calcium phosphate , struvite uric acid , calcium oxalate common . It well know struvite stone associate active infection , however role bacteria formation type kidney stone , include calcium oxalate , well understood . The investigator hypothesize bacteria present urinary tract patient without active infection ability facilitate calcium oxalate crystal formation provide surface stone grow . An understanding role bacteria formation non-infection stone could help prevent stone formation alter bacteria present within patient decrease eliminate risk kidney stone disease .</detailed_description>
