	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization report Thailand rank third number road fatalities 38.1 per 100,000 inhabitant 2010 . Most case admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) respiratory intervention intubation mechanical ventilation lead common problem pulmonary complication pneumonia atelectasis . Evidence support effectiveness chest physical therapy technique ( CPT ) improve alveolar collapse remove pulmonary secretion . A previous study show positive airway pressure technique reduce work breathing ( WOB ) re-inflated lung atelectasis . The use positive pressure device part physiotherapy intervention since intermittent positive pressure breathing introduce clinical practice . In intensive care setting , use positive pressure physiotherapist include manual hyperinflation ( bag bag squeeze ) , show increase oxygenation mobilize excessive bronchial secretion , re-inflate collapse area . Manual hyperinflation technique ( MHI ) provide use patient lung atelectasis . Several study demonstrate short-term effect increase oxygenation pulmonary compliance , improve lung collapse , remove pulmonary secretion . To apply MHI technique , patient disconnect ventilator lead adverse effect lose positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) correspond loss functional residual capacity , decreased oxygenation , shear stress distal lung unit . An alternative method perform pulmonary hyperinflation use mechanical ventilator . Although evidence positive pressure intervention continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) intermittent positive pressure breathe IPPB ) improve lung expansion mobilize secretion airway , study examine ventilator-induced hyperinflation physiotherapy intervention intensive care . A previous study show ventilator hyperinflation technique ( VHI ) effective MHI improve pulmonary complication secretion retention lung atelectasis . Especially , VHI technique use applied mechanical ventilator , patient disconnect ventilator therefore result loss PEEP adverse effect . Atelectasis common pulmonary complication acute trauma patient maintain ventilator support would benefit VHI even though recent study indicate VHI technique improvement MHI technique relatively study hemodynamic response VHI . There controversy hemodynamic response VHI , Ventilator hyperinflation technique ( VHI ) especially valuable treat patient ICU technique percussion postural drainage may possible wound , broken bone surgical drain . However , technique rarely use physical therapist ICU , possibly concerned increase intra-thoracic pressure use VHI inflate lung result dangerous change heart rate blood pressure ; change may persist treatment lead complication pulmonary edema , lastly , positive pressure patient may precipitate episode cardiac arrhythmia . Recent study demonstrate heart rate blood pressure change VHI ICU patient condition patient study mixed , traumatic patient . Previous study show basal heart blood pressure increase patient underwent traumatic condition . The hemodynamic response VHI require safety increase physiotherapist 's confidence use technique ICU . Therefore , purpose study explore acute hemodynamic response VHI technique critical traumatic patient pulmonary complication intensive care unit .</detailed_description>
