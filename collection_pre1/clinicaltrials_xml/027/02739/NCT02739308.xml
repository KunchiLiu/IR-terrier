	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate influence 12-week proprioceptive training program neurofunctional control incidence ankle sprain fence athlete . The study develop six stage : familiarization , pre intervention , intervention , post intervention follow-up three six month . In pre intervention stage evaluate muscle strength inverter , everter , dorsal plantar flexor ankle flexor isokinetic dynamometer ; reaction time muscle Lunge Test ; neuromuscular control Star Excursion Balance Test performance Drop Vertical Jump Test . In intervention athlete perform proprioceptive training 12 week , three time week , last 30 minute . In post intervention , follow three six month hold pre intervention test record incidence injury occur study . The expected result end study improve variable , increase performance athlete decrease incidence ankle sprain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Proprioceptive Training Neurofunctional Control Ankle Sprains Incidence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fencing agility sport , high incidence injury low limb , ankle sprain prevalent . Injury prevention important improve performance reduce time athlete . Proprioceptive training program add training athlete , since addition easy application low cost , proprioception serf stabilize joint , prevent injury . Therefore aim study investigate influence 12-week proprioceptive training program neurofunctional control incidence ankle sprain fence athlete . The study randomize clinical trial , fence athlete 14 25 , multi-sport club Porto Alegre/RS , develop six stage : familiarization , pre intervention , intervention , post intervention follow-up three six month . The first step familiarize force test registration injury previous year . In pre intervention stage evaluate muscle strength inverter , everter , dorsal plantar flexor ankle flexor isokinetic dynamometer ; reaction time muscle Lunge Test ; neuromuscular control Star Excursion Balance Test performance Drop Vertical Jump Test . In intervention athlete perform proprioceptive training 12 week , three time week , last 30 minute . In post intervention , follow three six month hold pre intervention test record incidence injury occur study . For statistical analysis , data present mean standard deviation submit Shapiro-Wilk test , ANOVA hold repeated measure post hoc Bonferroni determine difference . The effect size calculate use Cohen 's test.o significance level 0.05 . The expected result end study improve variable , increase performance athlete decrease incidence ankle sprain .</detailed_description>
