	<brief_title>Usefulness A Scope Guide Assisted Colonoscopy Versus Conventional Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , standard practice consist utilizing traditional colonoscope depend manual manipulation learn expertise human anatomy . If scope guide reduce amount external maneuver require , reduce patient discomfort may reduce sedative requirement procedure . Reduction mechanical loop form advance scope reduce amount time per procedure potentially increase polyp detection . Additionally , physician unable complete procedure ( indicated reach cecum ( anatomical structure signify end colon ) , clinical data may lose . A reduction number loop form ease advance scope facilitate completion procedure . The patient expose inconvenience , danger , discomfort result study participation . Patients undergo colonoscopy SOC , enrol study , randomize envelope time procedure . If patient randomize scope guide , PI simply activate guide mechanical button place scope . If patient randomize SOC , physician proceeds colonoscopy without activate scope guide . The scope use regardless randomization result . The physician able turn magnetic function touch button . The colonoscopy procedure dependent upon use scope guide . However , use scope guide may assist physician perform procedure le physical manipulation . Without use ScopeGuide , endoscopist able perform procedure base anatomical knowledge use maneuver change patient position apply external pressure . This study test ScopeGuide decrease number maneuver require completion . If number maneuver decrease , likely decrease patient discomfort decrease duration procedure . This study also test ScopeGuide increase completeness procedure . 300 patient undergoing SOC colonoscopy randomize 1:1 receive traditional colonoscopy scope guide assist colonoscopy . This study ass scope guide assist function improve successful completion colonoscopy , time completion , reduction number mechanical loop external maneuver require advance scope . Polyp detection rate amount sedation require also assess .</detailed_description>
