	<brief_title>Effects Propofol-dexmedetomidine Immune Function Patients With Cancer Larynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The perioperative period might critical time primary cancer surgery many factor affect whether recurrence , metastasis , elimination immune system . Cancer surgery induce acute inflammatory response , due local tissue damage shed malignant cell blood lymphocytic circulation although meticulous surgical manipulation . Many evidence suggest several factor perioperative period affect immune system . These could attribute surgery per se , pain , anxiety , hypothermia , blood transfusion , anesthetic technique , anesthetic drug .Impairment immune system may allow malignant cell escape immuno-surveillance metastasize perioperative period.As well increase risk postoperative complication , systemic inflammatory response syndrome , sepsis , multi-organ failure . Previous retrospective clinical study breast prostate cancer surgery suggest association anaesthetic technique cancer recurrence . However , retrospective trial various form cancer show benefit .</detailed_description>
