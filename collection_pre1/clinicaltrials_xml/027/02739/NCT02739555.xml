	<brief_summary>Osteoid osteoma ( OO ) benign osteogenic tumor occur child young adult , responsible intense bone pain , tendency spontaneously heal mineralization nidus , extremely slowly . This healing may accelerate patient take NSAIDs regularly year . The long delay heal intense pain , explain patient quickly direct surgeon specialized radiology department tumor ablation .

	<detailed_description>Osteoid osteoma ( OOs ) small , benign painful bone tumor , mainly observe child young adult . Pain , almost universal , characteristically great night . Pain well relieve NSAIDs resolution always complete pain reappears hour last dose . Also long-term consumption NSAID lead serious adverse event . Therefore OOs usually cure shortly diagnosis , mainly mean percutaneous treatment ( PT ) compute tomography ( CT ) ( radiofrequency coagulation interstitial laser ablation ) . The clinical success rate use technique 96 % 6-month , 94 % 24-month . However , technique distribute everywhere since perform highly specialized interventional radiologist . The PT perform general , spinal regional anesthesia . General anesthesia use case , especially child . When OO locate close proximity skin , cartilage , vessels nerve , severe complication may occur additional procedure infusion saline injection CO2 interface OO vulnerable structure do . Also anatomic location accessible PT . The natural history OOs remain poorly understood . However investigator small series conservatively treat OOs suggest spontaneous heal lesion mineralization nidus resolution pain ( mean duration pain patient NSAID treatment : 33 month NSAID ) . The efficacy bisphosphonates pain related benign ( Langherhans cell histiocytosis , fibrous dysplasia , Paget disease ) malignant bone lesion widely report . The investigator observe efficacy small series 20 patient percutaneously hard-to-reach recurrent OO use one three infusion zoledronate . The clinical efficacy assess pain relief accompany significantly increase mineralization nidus . The investigator postulate bisphosphonates accelerated natural history OO . Our hypothesis three infusion zoledronate ( 4mg ) repeat monthly patient symptomatic OO non-inferior percutaneous treatment efficacy , measure pain relief Visual Analogical Scale ( VAS ) . The main objective randomize study demonstrate patient OO , treatment three intravenous cycle 4mg zoledronic acid administer monthly , non-inferior treatment percutaneous thermal ablation efficacy measure percentage pain relief baseline end treatment . NB : Patients OO would percutaneously accessible ( say percutaneous treatment surgical excision destruction expose patient substantial risk term neurologic joint damage ) offer participate cohort , Lariboisière hospital . In cohort , clinical follow-up conduct currently propose Laribosisière hospital ( act add research ) . Objectives register explain patient . It consist collect anonymized medical data bisphosphonate treatment statuate efficacy bisphosphonates relieve pain due osteoid osteoma . Study design randomize study : - Selection / Inclusion visit : verification eligibility , randomization recollection patient consent . - Intervention : - percutaneous thermal ablation V1 visit ( i.e . maximum one month selection / inclusion visit ) - three zoledronic acid infusion V1 , V2 ( one month v1 ) V3 visit ( one month V2 ) - V4 visit 4 month ( end treatment , evaluation main outcome ) V7 visit 16 month ( end study , evaluation secondary outcome ) . - Option : One 3 additional visit ( V4 , V5 V6 ) zoledronic acid infusion propose patient , depend efficacy previous infusion .</detailed_description>
