	<brief_title>Fetal Head Circumference Predictor Operative Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When vaginal delivery pose danger mother newborn infant , operative delivery ( instrumental cesarean section ) indicate . Some specific indication operative delivery include prolong second-stage labor , suspect compromise fetus , health-related disorder fetus mother justify shorten second-stage active labor . In case cephalo-pelvic disproportion ( CPD ) suspect instrumental delivery possible fails , cesarean section play critical role . Studies try identify woman great risk CPD conclude neither x ray , compute tomography magnetic resonance image proven value labor management predict clinical outcome . Previous study assess fetal factor associate operative delivery focus mainly estimate fetal weight predict macrosomia . Nonetheless , ultrasound estimation fetal weight show differ much 20 % actual birth weight , identify case suspect fetal macrosomia , diabetic pregnancy , find improve labor outcome . As week may possibly elapse time last antenatal assessment onset labor , challenge related timing ultrasound assessment . Several study show association increase Fetal Head Circumference ( FHC ) prolong second-stage labor , instrumental delivery cesarean section . However , FHC acquire follow delivery predictive value intervention labor .</detailed_description>
