	<detailed_description>The investigator aim explore systematic follow-up newer generation serum antiepileptic drug level provide tangible benefit care people epilepsy . `` Systematic therapeutic drug monitoring '' perform clinic consultation automatically transmit clinician compare clinically require therapeutic drug monitoring ( `` rescue therapeutic drug monitoring '' , transmit case predefined inefficacy tolerance problem , define combine endpoint ) , assess systematic therapeutic drug monitoring prevent proportion treatment failure adverse event . In `` rescue therapeutic drug monitoring '' arm , communication level result provide study endpoint ( treatment failure side effect discuss ) reach . This design previously successfully use group oncological setting . A combined endpoint use accounting efficacy adverse event ; occurrence event consider endpoint : 2 seizure impaired consciousness , status epilepticus ( defined seizure last &gt; 5 minute ) , need add-on antiepileptic drug , need discontinue study drug ( lack efficacy adverse reaction ) hospital admission . You include epilepsy follow epilepsy outpatient clinic , new generation antiepileptic drug , require treatment adjustment inefficacy tolerance problem . Pregnant woman therapeutic drug monitoring recommend exclude . Outcome measure occurrence composite endpoint include inefficacy treatment emergent adverse event . The study power would certainly maximal trial compare therapeutic drug monitoring-based dosage individualization complete abstention TDM . However , accord experience , mere existence analytical service make difficult deny access certain patient argument belong control group , raise ethical concern case perceive need measurement potentially worrying clinical condition . Therefore , study adopts pragmatic approach , aim compare routine priori adjustment new generation antiepileptic drug dosage base therapeutic drug monitoring selective posteriori offer therapeutic drug monitoring service case clinical problem ( insufficient response , suspicion medication toxicity ) . It conceivable design could lower risk bias favour therapeutic drug monitoring , prescribers willing obtain measurement result patient control group may subtly incite notify easily occurrence clinical problem group . The endpoint however well define minimise potential bias .</detailed_description>
