	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Direct Current Stimulation Cognition Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive function EEG correlate thoroughly assess schizophrenia patient undergoing tDCS treatment compare patient receive placebo stimulation . The treatment involve 20 minute tDCS application leave prefrontal temporo-parietal cortex , twice day five day , procedure show effective improving symptom psychosis negative symptom hallucination . Critically , addition standard neuropsychological testing , cognitive assessment involve task tap cognitive control work memory , impairment comprise two core cognitive disturbance schizophrenia link brain rhythm disturbance measurable EEG recording . Investigators also assess change functional outcome tDCS investigate relationship improvement cognition , brain rhythms functional outcome . All assessment occur prior tDCS application , completion tDCS series , 2 month follow-up . There two separate independent group patient randomize active versus sham treatment . The first group early course schizophrenia ( less 5 year antipsychotic treatment ; n=40 ) . The second group chronic schizophrenia ( great 5 year antipsychotic treatment ; n=40 ) . Relevance This proposal would first integrate study effect tDCS cognitive symptom , brain function functional outcome schizophrenia . A positive outcome would represent marked improvement clinical therapeutic cognition psychosis provide powerful tool improve functional outcome debilitate disorder . Understanding impact brain rhythm disturbance could support study similar stimulation-based therapeutic approach neuropsychiatric disorder show similar disturbance cognition brain rhythm activity , bipolar disorder autism .</detailed_description>
