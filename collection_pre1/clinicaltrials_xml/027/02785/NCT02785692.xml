	<brief_summary>Postoperative wound heal complication follow preoperative radiotherapy represent severe problem treatment malignant soft tissue tumor , report 34 % . The literature discuss intensely advantages disadvantage multimodal treatment concept different opinion . The Canadian prospective randomize NCIC SR2 trial show increase wound complication rate study arm receiving preoperative radiation . The Sarcoma Center Zurich pursue mainly treatment concept result shall analyse publish . The approach show complication rate comparable international bench mark , also ( still intermediate time ) local control rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : The Canadian prospective randomize NCIC SR2 trial test sequence radiation surgery soft tissue sarcoma extremity . Similar disease control rate follow pre- versus postoperative non-intensity modulate radiation therapy ( non-IMRT ) find , increase wound complication ( 17 % vs 35 % ) preoperative radiation arm , [ 95 % CI 5-30 ] , p=0Â·01 ) . The investigator assess single center preoperative IMRT ( IMRT-equivalent highly conformal three dimensional conventional RT ( 3DcRT ) ) cohort respect wound complication rate ( WCR ) . The hypothesis low WCR rate achieve era IMRT compare non-IMRT era Canadian Trial conduct . Methods : 67 consecutive patient irradiate 50Gy 25 fraction 3/2008-3/2016 preoperative IMRT ( n=48 , 72 % ) highly conformal IMRT-equivalent 3DcRT dose distribution ( n=19 , 28 % ) assess . All patient previously discuss weekly interdisciplinary sarcoma board Sarcoma Center Zurich .</detailed_description>
