	<brief_summary>Patients cancer particularly high risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . The guideline therefore strongly recommend thromboprophylaxis recent survey clearly show oncologist reluctant use concern bleeding , absence validate risk stratification tool uncertainty concern optimal thromboprophylaxis . Hence , real challenge identify individual VTE risk cancer patient individually tailor thromboprophylaxis . The study aim identify thrombin generation test ( TGT ) reliable , standardize overall haemostasis assay use evaluate individual thrombosis risk The secondary objective : - To define limit TGT parameter indicate thrombosis risk cancer patient - To evaluate value clot activation marker patient cancer Patients recently diagnose locally advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma origin , schedule systemic chemotherapy , enrol trial baseline ( Visit 1 ) . Thrombin generate capacity measure within first month follow diagnosis start chemotherapy ( Visit 1 Visit 2 ) subsequently end first cure line chemotherapy ( Visit 3 ) . Patients follow period 1 year , occurrence thromboembolic event . Two follow visit foreseen - 6-month ( Visit 4 ) 12-month ( end trial - Visit 5 ) visit . Patients eventually undergo second-line chemotherapy course follow-up remain study . The study document case symptomatic thromboembolic event together relevant diagnostic work-up .</brief_summary>
