	<brief_summary>The purpose study asses potential interaction methamphetamine doxazosin methamphetamine-dependent volunteer seek treatment . The study evaluate effect doxazosin cardiovascular subjective effect methamphetamine human laboratory study . The primary objective determine safety treatment doxazosin methamphetamine-dependent volunteer examine hemodynamic subjective effect administration ascend dos methamphetamine placebo dose treatment doxazosin . The secondary objective determine effect treatment doxazosin , compare placebo , subjective effect produce administration methamphetamine placebo</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To determine effect treatment doxazosin , compare treatment placebo , methamphetamine-induced crave subjective effect methamphetamine-dependent human volunteer . Secondary aim clarify genetics substance abuse , potentially lead improve method diagnosis risk help develop well therapeutic intervention develop new saliva-based test detection measurement drug abuse . Design/Procedure : Twenty non-treatment-seeking methamphetamine-dependent volunteer complete procedure treatment placebo study medication , random order , use within-subjects , double-blind , placebo-controlled design . There two week period phase . The dose doxazosin need alter effect methamphetamine unknown preclinical animal study conduct . Because , initially investigator study effect low dose doxazosin ( 4mg daily ) compare placebo daily . Methamphetamine ( 0 , 10 , 30mg , smoke ) administer treatment 4mg doxazosin/placebo . Methamphetamine administer ascend dose ( 10mg follow 20mg ) 0mg dose randomly intersperse maintain blind . Cardiovascular measure subjective effect rating assess follow methamphetamine administration . Participants monitor stability day 11 12 discharged hospital day 13 . If 4mg doxazosin treatment well tolerate associate alteration effect methamphetamine , second group subject study use sample size . Treatment begin 1mg increase 1mg increment every three day 8mg reach . Placebo dose identically . All study procedure identical described .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Be Englishspeaking volunteer seek treatment time study 2 . Be 1855 year age 3 . Meet DSMIV TR criterion methamphetamine dependence ; participant may may meet criterion nicotine dependence . Nicotine dependence allow require methamphetamine user smoke cigarette . 4 . Have selfreported history use methamphetamine smoke IV route 5 . Have vital sign follow : supine blood pressure &gt; 100/65 mm Hg , seat blood pressure &gt; 90/60 mm Hg , orthostatic change &lt; 20 mm Hg systolic &lt; 10 mm Hg diastolic stand . To ensure subject risk methamphetamine , rest pulse must &lt; 90 bpm blood pressure must &lt; 150 mmHg systolic &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic . 6 . Have hematology chemistry laboratory test within normal ( +/ 10 % ) limit follow exception : ) liver function test ( total bilirubin , ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase ) &lt; 3 x upper limit normal , b ) kidney function test ( creatinine BUN ) within normal limit 7 . Have baseline EKG demonstrate clinically normal sinus rhythm , clinically normal conduction , clinically significant arrhythmias 8 . Have medical history brief physical examination demonstrate clinically significant contraindication study participation , judgment admit physician principal investigator . 1 . Meet DSM IV TR criterion dependence drug methamphetamine nicotine . 2 . Have history evidence suggestive seizure disorder brain injury 3 . Have previous medically adverse reaction methamphetamine , include loss consciousness , chest pain , epileptic seizure 4 . Have neurological psychiatric disorder , : psychosis , bipolar illness major depression assess MINI organic brain disease dementia assess clinical interview history psychiatric disorder would require ongoing treatment would make study compliance difficult history suicide attempt within past year and/or current suicidal ideation/plan 5 . Have evidence clinically significant heart disease hypertension , determine PI 6 . Have evidence untreated unstable medical illness include : neuroendocrine , autoimmune , renal , hepatic , active infectious disease 7 . Have symptomatic HIV take antiretroviral medication 8 . Be pregnant nursing . Other female must either unable conceive ( i.e. , surgically sterilize , sterile , postmenopausal ) use reliable form contraception ( e.g. , abstinence , birth control pill , intrauterine device , condom , spermicide ) . All female must provide negative pregnancy urine test study entry , upon hospital admission , end study participation 9 . Have asthma currently use theophylline sympathomimetics 10 . Have illness , condition , use psychotropic medication , opinion PI and/or admit physician would preclude safe and/or successful completion study . Criteria Discontinuation Following Initiation Participants discharge positive breath test indicating use alcohol urine test indicate illicit use drug MEDVAMC , comply study procedure , tolerate study drug . Stopping criterion detail . Subject Selection Criteria Rationale Route administration . Participants require used MA IV smoke route avoid expose participant drug route administration produce intensive interoceptive effect usually use participant . Prior experience smoke MA allow ( rather restrict population experience IV MA ) smoke MA reach brain site action rapidly intravenously administer MA smoke MA produce effect comparable IV MA . Speed administration ( rate delivery brain ) stimulant drug likely impact subjective cardiovascular effect , smoke intravenously administer MA produce similar subjective effect ( 2226 ) .</criteria>
