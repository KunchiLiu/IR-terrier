	<brief_title>Low Level Laser Therapy With Physical Therapy Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential subject identify physician referral pain program initial evaluation medical personnel physical therapy appropriate inclusion pain program . For individual meet entry parameter pain program , project discuss physical therapist consideration voluntary participation . If participant willing participate , appropriate consent HIPPA permission obtain . After consent , patient randomize one two treatment cohort consist utilize either laser sham laser pain program participation . The principle investigator blind treatment allocation group . The treat clinician aware treatment allocation assignment laser application . Each treatment cohort complete assigned . Physical therapy treatment addition study intervention select treat clinician base participant 's specific need standard care would dictate . Outcome measure collect described . Testing Schedule : The assign study intervention ( LLLT Sham ) administer clinical visit phase 1 2 study . Outcome measure complete follow schedule . Phase 1 : Conducted period acceptance pain program start pain program ( 2-4 week ) . Baseline test pre ( T1 ) complete time initial evaluation enrollment study . A . Follow-up test post ( T2 , b , c ) complete weekly phase . B . Phase 1 final testing ( T3 ) first clinic visit formal pain program . The last testing period phase 1 also serve baseline Phase 2 . Phase 2 : This phase 4-week formal pain program ( 2 visits/week x 4 week , total 8 visit ) . Baseline test ( T3 ) first clinic visit formal pain program . C. Follow-up test post ( T4-T7 ) complete weekly phase 2 . D. Following completion pain program . Follow measurement complete 4 week post discharge ( T8 ) . Measurements : A . Numerical pain rating scale ( NPRS ) : perceive pain scale 0-10 ( 0=no pain , 10= extremely severe pain ) . Pain previous 24-hour period ( best , bad , current ) measure T1-T8 . The average 3 score use . B . Pain palpation : Defined pain pressure top 3 area primary complaint . Palpation pressure record mild , moderate , heavy . If algometry use , average number 3 trial use . A . Region specific functional outcome measure : A valid reliable outcome tool broad base physical function base body region interest complete . Measured clinic visit T1 , T3 , T5 , T7 , T8 . B. Questionnaires fear avoidance ( FABQ , TKS ) sleep quality ( Pittsburg sleep index ) take measure quality life impact . Measures take T1 , T3 , T7 , T8 . C. Global Rating Change scale ( GRC ) : 7-point self-assessed clinical progress scale participant 's perception change status . Measured T3 , T7 , T8 . D. Digital thermography photo : Using digi-therm camera , thermogram image spine upper low extremity take comparison area circulation inflammation . Measured T1 , T3 , T5 , T7 , T8 . All procedure , measurement , intervention ( exercise ) consider standard care rehabilitation subject 's need . The experimental aspect study derive randomized selection laser intervention utilized program participation .</detailed_description>
