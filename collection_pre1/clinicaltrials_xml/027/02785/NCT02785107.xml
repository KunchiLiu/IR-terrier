Two reason result may reliance intention proximal determinant behaviour lack consideration implicit/automatic determinant PA . The purpose study apply Multi-Process Action Control ( M-PAC ) , framework center PA intention-translation gradual building habit examine PA change use two-arm parallel design , randomize control trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Two prominent limitation traditional social cognitive model use understand moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) gap intention behaviour lack consideration implicit process behavioural enactment . Thus , new model examine attempt consider potential limitation . Multi-Process Action Control ( M-PAC ) one attempt build comprehensive schematic , whereby intention establish via mean construct traditional social cognitive theory ( i.e. , outcome expectation , perceive capability ) , success translate intention behaviour depend behavioural-regulation ( self-regulatory tactic ) ( BR ) , affective judgment ( expect pleasure ) ( AJ ) opportunity ( time , access ) . Over time , M-PAC propose habit ( stimulus -behaviour bond ) identity ( role-behaviour bond ) develop perform behaviour largely contribute maintenance PA . Aim : The purpose study conduct two-arm parallel design , RCT determine M-PAC experimental group would demonstrate great change PA post-intention construct across time . Methods : Participants ( n=94 ) inactive new gym member randomize control M-PAC experimental group . The experimental group attend workshop receive booster phone call follow-up week four . Measures group include accelerometry M-PAC baseline week eight .</detailed_description>
