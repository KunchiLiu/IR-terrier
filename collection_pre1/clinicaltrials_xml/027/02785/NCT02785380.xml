	<brief_summary>Management recurrent HCC urgent several treatment develop .Repeat hepatectomy consider first choice recurrent HCC . Unfortunately , repeat open hepatectomy perform small proportion patient due inadequate liver function reserve , widespread recurrence high invasiveness . Given recurrent tumor usually detect small size follow-up initial surgery , radiofreqency ablation ( RFA ) , less invasive , may locally curative cause minimal damage liver function reserve , widely use . However , re-recurrence rate RFA 50 % , recurrence-free survival le 20 % . Recently , satisfactory short- long-term oncological outcome report laparoscopic surgery ( LS ) treatment primary HCC cirrhosis . Some single center pilot study report LS may , compare open surgery , improve prognosis HCC le blood loss shorter hospital stay . LS initially consider suitable recurrent HCC due postoperative adhesion might make laparoscopic surgical procedure difficult less safe . With improvement technique experience , recent study show LS recurrent HCC cirrhotic patient safe feasible procedure good short-term outcome . However , thus far , study perform evaluate long-term oncological outcome LS recurrent HCC , compare result RFA . To clarify issue , multicenter retrospective comparative study use propensity score match method include large consecutive series patient recurrent HCC within Milan criterion , underwent LS RFA , perform .</brief_summary>
