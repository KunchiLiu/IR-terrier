	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety TF0023 Spray Subjects With Ischemic Strokes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind ( within dose ) , placebo-controlled , parallel group study conduct 2 part evaluate efficacy safety TF0023 spray versus placebo functional improvement patient ischemic stroke . Part A evaluate safety efficacy TF0023 spray high dose . Efficacy assess change modify Rankin Scale ( mRS ) score baseline Week 16 . At Week 16 , blind interim analysis perform determine TF0023 show positive result high proportion patient TF0023 group show favorable outcome compare placebo group . If result positive , Part B initiate evaluate safety efficacy TF0023 spray well determine best dose regimen sign symptom functional improvement patient ischemic stroke . Part A ( Proof-of-Concept ) In Part A ( proof-of-concept ) , approximately 200 patient stable per NIHSS screen early 3 day ( 72 hour ) onset stroke symptom approximately 75 randomize active placebo treatment 2:1 ratio ( TF0023 [ 50 patient ] placebo [ 25 patient ] ) . Each patient enrol Group A receive study treatment double-blind manner 16 week start 3 10 day onset stroke symptom ( Day 1 study ) . Qualified study personnel instruct patient and/or caregiver apply study treatment accurately patient caregiver administer high dose either TF0023 placebo twice daily ( approximately every 12 hour ) . Patients return study site Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 efficacy safety assessment . After Week 16 assessment perform , patient receive active treatment open-label manner start next day end study ( EOS ) Week 32 . That , patient receive active treatment continue receive active treatment , patient receive placebo switch active treatment remain 16 week study . Patients receive one dose study treatment Week 16 visit day . Patients return study site Week 24 Week 32 ( EOS ) efficacy safety assessment . An Early Termination visit occur patient discontinue study prematurely . Patients follow-up visit approximately 14 day Early Termination visit Week 32 ( EOS ) visit . An interim analysis perform use data collect study include Week 16 visit . If analysis mRS show treatment TF0023 positive compare placebo ( mRS score 0 2 indicates functional independence ) , Part B start enroll patient . If analysis show treatment TF0023 positive compare placebo ( mRS score &gt; 2 ) , Part B enroll patient . Treatment group assignment Week 16 interim analysis remain blind Investigator patient throughout duration study . Part B ( Dose-Range-Finding ) In Part B ( dose-range-finding ) , approximately 400 patient stable per NIHSS screen early 3 day ( 72 hour ) onset stroke symptom approximately 150 randomize 1:1 ratio Group B ( middle dose TF0023 placebo twice daily ) Group C ( low dose TF0023 placebo twice daily ) . Patients randomize 2:1 ratio within treatment group : Group B - TF0023 middle dose bid [ 50 patient ] placebo [ 25 patient ] ) Group C ( TF0023 low dose bid [ 50 patient ] placebo [ 25 patient ] ) . The study design Part B use Part A . Each patient enrol either Group B Group C receive study treatment double blind manner 16 week start 3 10 day onset stroke symptom ( Day 1 study ) . Qualified study personnel instruct patient and/or caregiver apply study treatment accurately patient caregiver administer correct number sprays/dose active treatment placebo twice daily ( approximately every 12 hour ) depend assign treatment group . Patients return study site Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 efficacy safety assessment . After Week 16 assessment perform , patient receive active treatment open-label manner start next day EOS Week 32 . That , patient receive active treatment double-blinded period continue receive active treatment , patient receive placebo switch active treatment remain 16 week study . Patients receive one dose study treatment Week 16 visit day . Patients return study site Week 24 Week 32 ( EOS ) efficacy safety assessment . An Early Termination visit occur patient discontinue study prematurely . Patients follow-up visit approximately 14 day Early Termination visit Week 32 ( EOS ) visit .</detailed_description>
