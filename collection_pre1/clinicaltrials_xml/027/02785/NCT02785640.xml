	<brief_title>Prompting Activity Workplace Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There increase evidence demonstrate excessive unhealthy pattern sedentary behaviour increase risk range health problem , independent level physical activity . Increasingly , people employ low activity occupation office worker identify one sedentary role . Small scale study use prompt remind office worker stand show promising result , well represent low-cost solution employer . This study build upon recent pilot study investigate impact prompt deliver via Microsoft Outlook , sedentary behaviour office worker . Developed accordance Medical Research Council framework design multi-component intervention study utilise Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) theoretical basis . SCT describe complex interaction individual environment . The influence office environment sedentary behaviour clearly illustrated difference people 's sit pattern inside outside work hour . Behavioural change technique link construct SCT also show positive impact sedentary behaviour , namely education , goal set feedback . Participants study therefore receive education benefit break sit , tip achieve , feedback baseline sit behaviour . This study test impact technique sit time pattern , also track influence different construct SCT individual ' readiness change measure time point throughout intervention . To address fact sit work may conscious decision , perform habit , half participant also receive prompt remind stand . The prompt use pilot study , addition extra activity monitoring period enable u ascertain whether impact prompt diminish intervention period . This study aim recruit 60 desk-based office employee via email invitation . Volunteers screen use inclusion/exclusion criterion ask provide sign consent . Sitting de-emphasised participant information sheet , documentation use recruitment , order minimise impact baseline activity measurement . Cluster randomisation use split participant two equal group ( Group 1 n=30 , group 2 n=30 ) base physical location within office ( ) order minimise contamination group . Randomisation software use allocate group www.randomisation.com . Baseline measurement participant consist completion questionnaire activity monitoring follow : 1 . Questionnaires : - Q1 : Demographic data - obtain basic information participant - Q2 : Stage change questionnaire - measuring readiness change - Q3 : Social cognitive theory questionnaire - measure key construct SCT 2 . Activity monitoring : - Participants ask wear water-proofed activPAL activity monitor* front thigh period 7 consecutive day ( 24 hour day ) - A brief diary complete 7 day - The activPAL activity monitor validate measure categorise sitting/lying , stand walk use acceleration signal thigh . Following collection baseline data , participant attend 1 hour education session receive presentation outlining : health problem associate prolonged sedentary behaviour ; much sitting recommend ; feedback baseline sit behaviour ; tip reduce break sedentary behaviour . They give summary baseline activity data . Group 1 return work normal . Group 2 receive excel file upload Microsoft Outlook deliver prompt break sit random time , within hour . The prompt run period 10 week content brief , positively frame message evaluate favourably participant pilot project . Measurements participant repeat follow : Questionnaires Q2 Q3 repeat education session 12 week follow-up ; 1 week activity monitoring repeat week 2-4 intervention period , 8-10 intervention period , 12 week follow . Following final measurement , participant invite one series semi-structured focus group explore feasibility , acceptability , meaningfulness effectiveness intervention . Focus group record use digital voice recorder transcribed . Data treat confidential , anonymised , store securely line GCU 's data protection policy . Electronic copy activity data keep 10 year , alongside electronic paper copy questionnaires diary audio transcribed account focus group . Physical activity data basic demographic data also keep password protect database secure server . The data hold database identifiable . The information collect may use analysis staff student School Health Life Sciences Glasgow Caledonian University later date . Access data restrict controlled Dr Ben Stansfield , PGRT School Health Life Sciences , GCU . Individuals identifiable report publish employer , JJML , receive report contain amalgamate data . : Each participant receive brief summary baseline activity data education session . In addition , end study provide activity report , summarise individual activity data 4 measurement period . A report amalgamate data , include result focus group , produce JJML also make available study participant . Furthermore , result write PhD thesis , publish appropriate academic journal discuss conference presentation .</detailed_description>
