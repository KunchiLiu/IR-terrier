	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compare nivolumab ipilimumab nivolumab alone treat patient stage IV squamous cell lung cancer come back previous treatment . This `` non-match '' sub-study include screened patient eligible biomarker-driven sub-study . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab ipilimumab , may able shrink tumor . It yet know whether nivolumab work well without ipilimumab treat patient squamous cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1400I Lung-MAP : Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer No Matching Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient advanced stage refractory squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCA ) lung randomize nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare investigator-assessed progression-free survival ( IA-PFS ) patient advanced stage refractory SCCA lung randomize nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab . II . To compare response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 among patient randomize receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab . III . To compare response rate ( confirm , complete partial ) per RECIST 1.1 among patient randomize receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab . IV . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab . TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate differential treatment effect OS , IA-PFS , response tumor program death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression status . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 ipilimumab IV 60 minute day 1 every third course ( every 42 day ) . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow death 3 year sub-study registration , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
