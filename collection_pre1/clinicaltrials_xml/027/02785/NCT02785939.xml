	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well palbociclib work treat patient stage IV squamous cell lung cancer come back previous treatment . This sub-study include screened patient positive cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 ( CDK4/6 ) biomarker . CDK4/6 cause tumor cell grow quickly . Palbociclib may decrease activity CDK4/6 may able shrink tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1400C Lung-MAP : Palbociclib Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer Positive Biomarker Matches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate sufficient evidence continue Phase III component evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) cell cycle gene alteration positive patient register S1400C treat palbociclib . ( Phase II ) II . If study meet criteria specify S1400 Section 11.2a , study amend include follow-on randomized Phase III trial . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate investigator-assessed progression-free survival ( IA-PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) cell cycle gene alteration-positive treated palbociclib . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate duration response ( DoR ) among cell cycle gene alteration positive patient treat palbociclib achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) ( confirm unconfirmed ) Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate palbociclib . ( Phase II ) TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES : I . To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers may modify response define resistance palbociclib beyond chosen biomarker biomarker-driven sub-studies . II . To identify potential resistance biomarkers disease progression . III . To establish tissue/ blood repository patient refractory squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCA ) lung . OUTLINE : As 12/18/2015 , patient assign Arm I . ARM I : Patients receive palbociclib orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/18/2015 ) : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon progression , patient may eligible re-register Arm III . ARM III : Patients Arm II eligible re-registration receive palbociclib PO day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month first 2 year end year 3 date sub-study/re-registration .</detailed_description>
