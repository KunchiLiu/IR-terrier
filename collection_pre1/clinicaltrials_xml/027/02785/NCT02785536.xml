	<brief_title>RITCH : Reducing Disparities Tobacco Cessation Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct five phase . Each phase utilizes result previous phase . Each phase also associate least one specific aim . Phase One ( Aim One ) : Complete revise version standard , widely utilized , multi-component , cognitive-behavior treatment manual tobacco dependence include commonly utilized , cognitive-behavioral intervention specifically address key factor associate treatment outcome disparity . Phase Two ( Aim Two ) : Using PEN-3 Model,1-3 target tailor RITCh_1 address need smoker low SES well smokers minority , particularly African American . In preparatory activity , research team tailor target RITCh_1 use well-accepted theoretical model produce second draft revise treatment , call RITCh_2 . Human subject involve phase research . No data collect . Phase Three ( Aim Three ) : Pilot test RITCh_2 three treatment group ( 5-10 participant per group ) ass understandability acceptability ensure deliver 60-minute per session time frame standard treatment . This qualitative study investigator pilot test RITCh_2 21 participant consent pilot study participant . See Pilot Study Informed Consent Form . Contact demographic information collect participant , baseline outcome assessment . Participant feedback provide group format link identifying information . The research team incorporate participant feedback third draft revise treatment , RITCh_3 . Phase Four ( Aim Four ) : Compare effect SES treatment outcome socioeconomically racially diverse group participant treat RITCh_3 standard treatment . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial ( n=253 ) compare efficacy RITCh_3 standard treatment . Investigators use randomized treatment design two method assess abstinence ( latency relapse six-month point prevalence abstinence rate ) compare effect SES treatment condition treatment outcome . Investigators expect RITCh_3 demonstrate fewer treatment outcome disparity standard treatment . Phase Five ( Aim Five ) : Compare effect RITCH_3 standard treatment key factor associate treatment outcome disparity ( see Aim One Table 1 ) . Using analysis covariance logistic regression appropriate , investigator analyze effect treatment condition key factor ( see Table 1 ) . The investigator expect participant treat RITCh_3 demonstrate improvement key factor participant treated standard treatment .</detailed_description>
