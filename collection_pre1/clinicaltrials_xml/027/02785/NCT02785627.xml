	<brief_summary>The ANTELOPE trial longitudinal observational clinical study change bone density , structure strength 12 month men receive treatment prostate cancer . Three group ( n = 30 per group ) compare , bone assessment baseline 12 month . Allowing 18 month recruitment period , 12 month follow-up data analysis , total study length 3 year . The group comprise : Group A - Men prostate cancer start ADT Group B - Men newly diagnose hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer , start ( start within past 3 month ) ADT undergo chemotherapy docetaxel prednisolone Group C - Age-matched men without prostate cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Bone Loss Men Receiving Treatment Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common non-skin cancer men , 40,000 new case diagnose UK year . Development prostate cancer depend upon testosterone ( male hormone ) , medication block testosterone ( eg Androgen Deprivation Therapy , ADT ) help men survive many year . Men metastatic prostate cancer also treat ADT , recent evidence demonstrate survival benefit chemotherapy give well ADT . Many patient receive chemotherapy first line treatment along ADT context newly diagnose metastatic disease . However , block testosterone cause bone loss may lead osteoporosis increase risk osteoporotic fracture . Such fracture cause pain , loss mobility independence , one three men hip fracture die within one year . The osteoporosis cause prostate cancer treatment may differ form ; limit available data suggest may affect wrist bone ( form affect spine hip ) . We need good understand pattern osteoporosis men , offer effective treatment protect bone ensure stay well possible live cancer treatment The aim study determine effect prostate cancer treatment bone health . Comprehensive bone assessment baseline 12 month include different bone scan ( DXA whole body , Xtreme CT radius HR CT T12 vertebra ) , biochemical marker bone turnover , anthropometric measurement , assessment grip strength muscle strength function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All participant Men age 5080 year old , WHO performance status ≤2 . Have provide write informed consent prior trialspecific procedure Able willing comply term protocol undertake trial assessment Body Mass Index ( kg/m2 ) &gt; 18.5 &lt; 35.0 No evidence significantly abnormal organ function standard laboratory test Group A Histological confirmation prostate cancer No indication metastatic disease Scheduled commence ADT ( must baseline assessment carry within 4 week commencement ADT ) . Those start ADT expect duration treatment 12 month . No prior systemic therapy advance prostate cancer ( receive concurrent antineoplastic therapy , besides ADT antiandrogens ) , participant may receive radiotherapy may receive study period Group B Men newly diagnose hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer commence ADT refer chemotherapy Bone metastases allow provided radius ( DXA measurement attempt image sit no/minimal bone metastasis ) Men receive palliative radiotherapy know bone metastases prior study may include , site radiotherapy must accurately record attempt make avoid site subsequent DXA measurement . Men bone pain due know bone metastasis may receive necessary analgaesia , include opiate , need study Participants group B allow continue oral corticosteroid , provide dose exceed 2mg dexamethasone 10 mg prednisolone daily . Men group may also receive additional steroid prophylaxis chemotherapy . Group C • Men diagnosis prostate cancer Known metabolic bone disease disease ( prostate cancer ) know affect bone metabolism include : hyperthyroidism , primary hyperparathyroidism , chronic liver disease , rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease malabsorption Medications ( addition ADT ) know affect bone metabolism include osteoporosis treatment antiepileptics Previous hormone treatment within 1 month ( ADT Groups A B ) Any concurrent recent invasive cancer could confuse diagnosis endpoint . Allowed situation include , limited , nonmelanoma skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer ( doubt please discuss trial team ) . Fracture orthopaedic surgery within last 12 month Arthritis , orthopaedic surgery abnormality radius , spine hip would prevent accurate acquisition study measurement . Current prior ( within one month ) participation clinical trial involve medicinal product , except STAMPEDE men group B . For trial , please consult trial team . For Group B , bisphosphonates alpharadon study entry exclude ( please see separate advice Pg 19 men need go bisphosphonates alpharadon whilst study ) . Groups A C : Men take oral systemic corticosteroid ( inhaled steroid permit ) . In Group B oral corticosteroid permit , provide dose exceed 2mg dexamethasone 10mg prednisolone daily . Those group B may also receive additional steroid give prophylaxis alongside chemotherapy</criteria>
