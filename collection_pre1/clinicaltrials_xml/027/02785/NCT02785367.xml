Many work connect presence cord blood acidosis development neonatal cerebral palsy . According American Association Obstetrics Gynecology , cord blood gas sample necessary prenatal event may relate ( rightly ) negative neonatal outcome . This approach might necessary case legally controversial need prove umbilical cord gas value normal pre-natal period .
