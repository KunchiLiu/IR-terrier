	<brief_summary>Sleep exerts dual effect learning : one hand , good sleep quality allow good daytime aptitude lead knowledge acquisition . On hand , sleep learn necessary knowledge consolidation . A key role sleep clearly demonstrated memory consolidation adult . Sleep lead strengthen memory promote brain plasticity . Surprisingly , sleep influence learn stabilization scarcely study childhood child affect sleep disorder . Yet , sleep disorder concern almost 30 % child frequently relate worsen academic performance . Classical neuropsychological evaluation child , base daytime learning , often fail determine cognitive profile explain academic difficulty . The investigator hypothesize lack sleep-dependent consolidation could take active part child 's cognitive academic difficulty . This proposal aim characterize interaction sleep , learn memory process study child elementary school age ( 6-12 year ) . The investigator evaluate sleep-dependent memory consolidation process child sleep disorder treatment healthy control . Neuropsychological test academic performance also evaluated.. The comparison performance obtain medical treatment , allow understand whether normalisation sleep quality permit restoration sleep-dependent memory consolidation .</brief_summary>
