	<brief_summary>Overall project design : This PhD project involve randomize study diabetic individual heal resistant wound , compare effect passive movement low limb standard treatment diabetic wound . How effectively improve condition peripheral arterial disease limit . The primary purpose study uncover whether passive movement low limb influence muscle oxygen demand thereby increase blood flow . An increase muscle oxygen demand likely increase blood flow rate number capillary , would induce heal wound , previously possible . The secondary purpose increase understand pathophysiological process wound heal study biochemical marker vascularization , inflammation stem cell recruitment blood sample . Further analyze skin muscle biopsy number quality endothelial cell Capillary density develop new quantifiable method evaluate wound heal . The project randomize trial , consist simple passive training improve blood vessel function , increase growth small blood vessel , thereby prevent ulceration ultimately amputation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Passive Training Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background information Diabetic foot ulcer one frequent serious complication diabetes mellitus . Despite attempt prophylaxis* , two-thirds diabetic foot ulcer eventually heal , 15-20 % ultimately require minor major amputation ( Major low extremity amputation define ankle joint , minor amputation ankle joint . The incidence diabetes grow , multifactorial cause impair heal chronic diabetic ulcer still well understood . The diabetic foot ulcer know reduce quality life patient psychically psychologically therefore investigation new treatment option plausible . Current knowledge regard improve condition begin phase peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) limit . Investigators know high oxygen tension perfusion limb well adequate density microvessels tissue , essential wound healing . Therefore , intervention increase blood flow promote microcirculatory growth likely beneficial treatment wound heal . *Dressings , debridement , compression , clinical observation , antibiotic glycemic control It report passive training consist knee flexion/extension kinetic machine beneficial effect regulation growth factor , remicrovascularization improve blood flow . Høier et al described passive movement leg induce two-fold elevation blood flow , elevation angiogenic factor initiate capillarization skeletal muscle . All three factor often impair diabetic leg , result poor wound heal . Due typical localization diabetic foot ulcer , patient group unable exercise properly . Therefore investigator use recent innovative model improvement limb microcirculation , develop Department Nutrition , Exercise Sports , University Copenhagen , involve passive movement lower leg , induce increase blood flow microcirculatory growth . Rationale trial Diabetic patient impair wound heal due multifactorial cause . The investigator know high oxygen tension , perfusion essential wound healing , accord Høier et al 's study , passive training increase perfusion elevate proangiogenic factor young healthy male peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) patient . Null hypothesis : 1 . Passive train lead enhance heal diabetic foot ulcer . 2 . Passive train low limb affect perfusion train limb . Perspective : This project aim discover passive train low limb increase heal diabetic foot ulcer . In addition , present new treatment offer diabetic patient ulcer , able heal properly perform active exercise . The investigator hope see benefit train accelerated heal affect PROM 's . Further present new knowledge specific molecular functional change occur tissue wound healing . This knowledge important improve understanding ulceration occur tissue begin decompose . This prospective , randomize , single-blinded , parallel control design trial subject diabetes mellitus investigate passive training treatment diabetic ulcer . The participant randomize either control group intervention . The control group receive standard wound treatment , intervention group receive standard wound treatment , passive training exercise 8 week . The participant follow 16 week clinical wound heal . All participant receive standard wound care consist debridement , dressing , compression , offload footwear necessary antibiotic The comparison group similar possible regard important participant characteristic might influence response intervention . Therefore , block randomization ensure equal number participant characteristic think affect prognosis response intervention , allocate comparison group .</detailed_description>
