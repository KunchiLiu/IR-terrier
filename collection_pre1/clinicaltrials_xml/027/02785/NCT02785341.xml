	<brief_summary>Although treatment significantly increase life expectancy cancer patient , quality life less reduce . The development supportive care , physical activity , one tool promote maintain quality life reduce treatment side effect , include fatigue . This study develop understand different biopsychosocial effect physical activity program carry patient suffer various type cancer , facilitate improve implementation type activity health care facility . Study randomize , control , cross-over intervention evaluate 12-week supervise adapted physical activity program . Participants assign one two group : Group A first follow 12-week physical activity program , undergoes usual care 12 additional week , Group B , continue usual care 12 week ( control group ) start physical activity program 12 additional week . Quality life ( questionnaires 2 group ) , well-being , fatigue , physical capacity , leptin concentration , goal set level physical activity evaluate protocol . By understand multidimensional effect physical activity program various cancer type , depend time propose program , evaluate correlation among variable , evaluate long-term effect , IPCAPA study contributes identify physical activity program effective , viable feasible patient undergo chemotherapy , whatever type cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adaptated Physical Activity During Chemotherapy : Evaluation Psychological , Physiological Biological Impact</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer one lead cause deaths world , estimate incidence 14.1 million per year ( 2012 ) world , 355,000 France . Despite increase survival rate cancer treatment , psychological impact diagnosis aggressiveness treatment chemotherapy tend significantly decrease quality life patient cancer care . Helping patient support regular treatment crucial point increase compliance treatment thus increase cure rate , many supportive care develop implement . Physical activity , regard non-drug therapy , provide many benefit , tertiary secondary prevention cancer treatment . Many study show decrease mortality physical activity treatment , especially breast , colon prostate cancer . Regular physical activity treatment increase patient ' quality life , many type cancer . The prevalence fatigue cancer well describe , well need effectively treat cancer relate fatigue order enable patient well withstand treatment . Within last decade , point physical activity one efficient way combat cancer relate fatigue . From psychological point view , physical activity decrease anxiety , depression stress , also increase self-esteem , perceive control , overall mental health .

Biologically , physical activity often result beneficial change circulation level adiponectin , leptin , insulin , C-reactive protein , especially breast , prostate gastric cancer . Overall , physical activity cancer treatment result improvement general quality life , include mental , physical social dimension . Although physical activity cancer treatment know induce many benefit , depend cancer type treatment , difficult clearly investigate effect physical activity cancer interact sequential . A good understand close relationship psychological physiological aspect might allow u good understand effect physical activity cancer . Exercise program use cancer treatment vary one study another duration , intensity frequency . Furthermore , patient include types cancer treatment consider . Our study , name Institut Paoli Calmettes Adapted Physical Activity , develop understand different biopsychosocial effect physical activity program carry patient suffer various type cancer , facilitate improve implementation type activity health care facility .</detailed_description>
