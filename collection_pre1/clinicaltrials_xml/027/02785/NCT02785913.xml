	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well taselisib ( GDC-0032 ) work treat patient stage IV squamous cell lung cancer come back previous treatment . This sub-study include screened patient positive phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) biomarker . PI3K cause tumor cell grow quickly . Taselisib may decrease activity PI3K may able shrink tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1400B Lung-MAP : Taselisib Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer Positive Biomarker Matches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate sufficient evidence continue phase III component evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) PI3K Genentech ( GNE ) -positive patient register S1400B treat GDC-0032 . ( Phase II ) II . If study meet criteria specify S1400 , study amend include follow-on randomized phase III trial . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate investigator-assessed progression free survival ( IA-PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) subset patient defined PI3K GNE-positive entire S1400B ( PI3K Foundation Medicine [ FMI ] positive ) study population treat GDC-0032 . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate ORR entire S1400B ( PI3K FMI positive ) study population treat GDC-0032 evaluate duration response ( DoR ) GNE positive FMI positive . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate DoR entire S1400B PI3K FMI positive study population GNE positive patient treat GDC-0032 achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) ( confirm unconfirmed ) Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate GDC-0032 . ( Phase II ) TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES : I . To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers may modify response define resistance GDC-0032 beyond choose biomarker biomarker-driven sub-studies . II . To identify potential resistance biomarkers disease progression . III . To establish tissue/ blood repository patient refractory squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCA ) lung . OUTLINE : As 12/18/2015 , patient assign Arm I . ARM I : Patients receive taselisib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/18/2015 ) : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon progression , patient may eligible re-register Arm III . ARM III : Patients Arm II eligible re-registration receive taselisib orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month first 2 year end year 3 date sub-study/re-registration .</detailed_description>
