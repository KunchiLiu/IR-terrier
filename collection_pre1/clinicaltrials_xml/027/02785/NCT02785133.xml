	<detailed_description>This study use prospective non-randomized , non-controlled design . Five-hundred ( 500 ) subject previously receive peripheral intravenous therapy enrol single treatment group . The purpose study evaluate safety , feasibility , cursory utility low-light source integrate exist peripheral intravenous catheter . The absence control group base follow reason : This pilot investigation establish baseline understanding safety , feasibility , cursory utility polychromatic light emit diode integrated exist 20-gauge 1.0 inch peripheral intravascular catheter improve self-reported overall subject energy level base change Epworth Sleepiness score . Peripheral intravascular therapy use decade effective therapy maintain proper hydration electrolyte level , deem non-significant medical procedure . Peripheral intravascular therapy infuse various molecular agent supplement ( Vitamin B12 ) purpose improve energy level overall quality life . However , use normal saline standard alone help improve hydration cell function . Low-energy light therapy establish alternative treatment myriad medical condition . Light-based therapy stimulate photoreceptors find within cell improve overall cellular bioenergetics . The concurrent administration low-light therapy peripheral intravascular normal saline therapy may serve viable therapy treatment improvement subject quality life energy level Accordingly , study design assess safety , feasibility , cursory improvement self-reported energy level follow intervention low-light therapy integrate standard peripheral intravascular catheter .</detailed_description>
