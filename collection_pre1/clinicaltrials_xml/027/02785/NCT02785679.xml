	<detailed_description>Background : Cow 's milk protein ( CMP ) allergy one common food allergy potentially fatal one . The incidence milk allergy 1.5-3 % first year life , 60 % reaction IgE mediate . CMP allergy tends resolve approximately 45-50 % infant 1 year age , 60-75 % age 2 , 85-90 % 3 year . The range IgE mediate CMP allergy 29-76 % . A recent study suggest natural history CMP allergy might change time , slow rate resolution high proportion child disease persist adolescence adulthood . In past described incidence CMP allergy child family positive history allergy . Early feeding CMP consider past risk factor development CMP allergy high risk infant . Although study argue assumption suggest early exposure CMP might protective atopic dermatitis CMP allergy . A cohort study first introduction CMP 15-30 day age , raise risk CMP allergy . A recent study peanut allergy find continuous early exposure peanut dramatically decrease incidence peanut allergy . The research field food allergy especially CMP allergy alert day . But far investigator knowledge , prospective study first day life examine influence early continuous exposure cow 's milk formula ( CMF ) CMP allergy . The exist data relate CMP allergy controversial inconclusive . Thus , one rely establish clear recommendation parent best time combine CMF infant diet . Working hypothesis aim : The aim study investigate early continuous exposure CMF decrease CMP allergy rate . The investigator assumption rate CMP allergy intervention group infant fee CMF , low group infant exclusively breast feed . Methods : Recruitment 2,500 infant first day life divide participant 4 group : 1 . Exclusive breast feeding . 2 . Exclusive CMF feeding . 3 . Breast feed 20 cc CMF per day . 4 . Breast feed one meal per day CMF . The mother complete survey questionnaire labor . Infants follow 1 year . During follow-up period -the participant examine allergologist age 2 month 1 year . In , infant follow phone questionnaire month . Specific CM IgE analysis umbilical cord blood skin test 2 month age perform . Inclusion criterion - Term near term newborn ( gestational age least 36 week ) , normal birth weight , normal perinatal follow-up without congenital defect . Expected result : The rate CMP allergy intervention group group exclusively CMF feed low group exclusive breast feeding . Importance : If investigator able prove study hypothesis ( even ) , significant influence diet recommendation infant . Probable implication Medicine : If investigator get expect result , recommendation exist today infant 's feeding change .</detailed_description>
