	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-arm clinical multicenter study intend measure normal structural parameter optic nerve head , peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer , macula use Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device . This study conduct African-American descent volunteer . The main goal study provide range structural parameter normal eye . The study include least 240 normal volunteer ; 10 study site recruit subject . Overall approximately equal age distribution 18 90 year approximately equal number female male enrol ( approximately 40-60 % female age group ) . All subject undergo Spectralis OCT imaging , biometric ophthalmoscopic examination , disc photography visual field test one single visit , possible . Repeated perimetry Spectralis scan may perform second visit within 30 day initial visit . All examination perform subject non-significant risk procedure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Able willing undergo test procedure , give consent , follow instruction . Signed informed consent Age ≥18 90 . Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery ( except cataract surgery Laser Situ Keratomileusis ) without clinically significant vitreal , retinal choroidal disease , clinically significant diabetic retinopathy ( subject may diabetes ) , disease optic nerve . Small drusen acceptable old subject . Black AfricanAmerican decent ( selfreported ) Negative history glaucoma ( include family history ) Intraocular pressure ≤21mmHg . Best correct visual acuity ≥20/40 . Refraction +6 6 diopter astigmatism ≤ 2 diopter . Axial length ≤ 26.0 mm ( optical biometry ) Normal visual field Glaucoma Hemifield Test Mean Deviation within normal limit abnormal visual field judgment ophthalmologist / optometrist Clinically normal appearance optic disc , normal appear neuroretinal rim respect color shape . The optic disc examine ophthalmoscopically evaluation stereo photograph . If eye eligible , eye enter study . Vulnerable subject ( define ISO 14155 GCP ) exception employee site , , applicable , student respective university . Staff listed delegation form exclude participation . Subjects unable read write Unreliable visual field . The reliability index use guide well perimetrist 's note . Unusable disc stereo photo . Inability undergo test . Insufficient quality Spectralis OCT image ( determine Spectralis OCT examination , unusual circumstance ) . Minimum requirement : Retina completely include image frame , Quality Score ≥ 20 stored ART mean image , For ONHR scan : Center position error ≤ 100 μm .</criteria>
