	<brief_summary>In osteopathy generally believe cranial bone equip inherent mobility , like joint may face restriction movement somatic dysfunction . For reason , different technique use aim increase mobility cranial bone . Some effective modifying physiological parameter related activity autonomic nervous system , cardiac function sleep latency . This study aim test effectiveness specific craniosacral technique , compression fourth ventricle CV4 , use salivary marker alpha amylase , sensitive change activity autonomic nervous system . To patient recruited student AIMO , ask provide saliva sample CV4 treatment . In particular , saliva collect four time per patient : initial time , administration stressful event ( hand immersion ice water ) , immediately application CV4 technique thirty minute application CV4 technique . For sample saliva detect , proceed measure activity alpha amylase flow rate , variable sensitive activation autonomic nervous system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A minimum 90 healthy subject range 20 25 year select student Accademia Itliana di Medicina Osteopatica , Saronno , Italy ( AIMO ) randomly assign placebo , control CV4 arm . Randomization account sex score STAI- 2 ( form Y ) questionnaire , assess trait anxiety subject . Every sample session take 10.00 AM 1.00 PM minimize effect diurnal variation salivary alpha-amylase activity . Subjects instruct abstain eating , smoking , drinking beverage exercise 2h experiment activity show influence sAA activity . The day treatment subject complete STAI-1 ( form Y ) questionnaire evaluate anxiety moment . Saliva collection make passive drooling continuously 5 minute 15 ml falcon tube . Saliva collect , immediately 30 minute application true CV4 technique application sham technique perform different osteopath . Saliva sample immediately frozen -20Â°C subsequent analysis . Operators osteopaths train cranial field . The application CV4 sham protocol occur examination room setting . The subject lie supine position operator head treatment table forearm rest table either CV4 either sham procedure . For CV4 technique practitioner contact participant 's occiput ( lateral external occipital protuberance , medial occipital-mastoid suture ) thenar eminence . When cranial mobility find , operator free use kind technique enhance cranial movement CV4 procedure . Once practitioner detect CRI , practitioner resist flexion phase CRI exaggerate extension phase . This compressive pressure maintain CRI stop , still-point reach . The still-point held CRI return , point compressive pressure slowly release . For sham CV-4 , The operator overlap hand thumb form `` V '' . The operator 's thenar eminence contact occiput lightly well position use CV4 procedure pressure occiput occipitomastoid suture . Once placement achieve , operator 's hand remain motionless 10 min . Finally , practitioner 's hand gently remove participant 's head place table procedure . Flow rate measure sample thaw 5 ml graduate capillary . Samples centrifuge ( ten minute 3000 rpm ) supernatant collect clean Eppendorf tube . Salivary alpha-amylase activity measure commercial kit ( IBL ) spectrophotometer optical reading .</detailed_description>
