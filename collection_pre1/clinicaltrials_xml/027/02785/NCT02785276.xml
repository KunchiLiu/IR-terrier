	<brief_summary>Aim The general aim study improve post-operative pain reduce morphine consumption follow laparoscopic ventral hernia repair ( LVHR ) . We specifically aim conduct randomize , double blind , control trial investigate effect intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia infusion post-operative morphine consumption . Methods : Patients randomise computer generate random number ( random permutation ) opaque envelope method . At closure , one small 2mm catheter belong AutoFuser pain pump system place peritoneal cavity onlay mesh parietal peritoneum . In treatment arm patient receive 275mL 0.2 % ropivacaine 4mL/h . In placebo arm , 275mL 0.9 % normal saline use similar fashion . The infusion run 68 hour total . All member involve patient care ( exception one independant research fellow ) blind . After 68 hour pump stop catheter remove . Assessment post-operative pain perform visual analogue scale , total opiate consumption collect converted morphine equivalent . Health significance : Local anaesthesia become important addition multimodal regimens analgesia follow surgery . Recent study show local anaesthetic ( LA ) wound infiltration improve post-operative pain compare standard opioid regimens pain relief . Only one previous study look bupivacaine infusion hernia sac three day follow LVHR . This study find improvement post-operative pain morphine consumption . We aim demonstrate improve pain reduced morphine consumption use alternative catheter insertion technique ropivacaine desire LA agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Pain Relief Following Laparoscopic Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific background : A ventral hernia ( VH ) fascial defect locate anterior abdominal wall . Primary VH include epigastric , umbilical spigelian hernia . A secondary defect incisional hernia develop previous surgical incision site ( 1 ) . VHs common condition risk factor include obesity , previous abdominal surgery elevate intra-abdominal pressure ( 2 ) . With New Zealand 's rise obesity epidemic incidence VH project increase ( 3-4 ) . Optimising peri-operative care patient undergo VH repair critical cost-effective healthcare increasingly significant issue . Surgical repair aim relieve symptom prevent complication ( 5-6 ) . Open mesh repair accept gold standard since prove superior open suture repair ( 7 ) . Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair ( LVHR ) grow popularity since introduction 1993 ( 8 ) . Studies show advantage open repair fewer infectious complication shorter hospital stay ( 9-12 ) . Importantly , LVHR favourable obese patient ( BMI &gt; 30 ) due low complication rate overall cost care ( 13-16 ) . Laparoscopic surgery consider less painful comparison open surgery , yet trial report difference acute chronic pain ( 17-19 ) . Severe pain follow LVHR significant clinical problem impact wellbeing , quality life patient satisfaction ( 20 ) . One hypothesis explain pain use tack suture mesh fixation ( 21-23 ) . Local anaesthesia become key adjunct multimodal post-operative regimen analgesia . This due few side effect nausea vomit , gut dysmotility respiratory depression ( 24 ) . Local anaesthetic ( LA ) agent easily apply directly injury site block afferent nociceptive nerve reduce local inflammatory response ( 25 ) . There significant benefit intraperitoneal application LA agent follow abdominal surgery ( 26-27 ) . Hence , operative insult peritoneum follow LVHR may control LA direct site mesh fixation intraperitoneal cavity ( 28 ) . Objective : Conduct randomise double-blinded controlled trial investigate effect intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia infusion post-operative pain morphine consumption patient undergo LVHR . Research Design : Randomised double-blinded clinical trial investigate intra-peritoneal infusion ropivacaine post-operative pain score patient undergo LVHR procedure . Ethics : Ethics approval project yet obtain . Sample size : Using morphine consumption data retrospective study conduct evaluate total opiate consumption first 24 hour follow LVHR surgery , order detect reduction morphine consumption 50 % first 24 hour post-operatively alpha 0.05 power 0.9 , 43 patient require group . We aim 48 patient arm anticipate possible drop out . Methodology : Patients recruit surgical outpatient clinic Manukau Super Clinic ( MSC ) . Patients undergo LVHR invite partake study . As research fellow study I involve data collection data analysis . Patients randomise computer generate random number opaque envelope method . In treatment arm patient receive 275mL 0.2 % ropivacaine wound catheter insertion placebo arm , receive 275mL 0.9 % normal saline similar fashion . One theatre staff nurse involved patient care give blind envelope pre-prepared lidocaine saline mixture theatre drug room . The mixture unlabelled appear similar color . All member staff involve patient care include anaesthetist blind solution administer . The theatre staff nurse prepare small infusion pump ( AutoFuser ) . The mixture use pump pre-mixed one clinical pharmacist Middlemore hospital involve patient care . The staff nurse un-blinded content mixture . The nurse prepare pump load either local anaesthetic saline solution . At closure , one small 2mm catheter , 30 small fenestration end , place peritoneal cavity onlay mesh parietal peritoneum infuse local anaesthetic . This penetrate skin closure complete . This attached infusion pump ( AutoFuser ) . This pump contain either 270mls 0.2 % ropivacaine 270mls 0.9 % saline . All member involve patient care include surgical , anaesthetic nursing team blind content pump . The pump activate set rate 4mls/hr immediately patient post-anaesthesia recovery room . The pump run continuously . The patient continue recovery ward per surgical team . After 68 hrs pump stop catheter remove similar fashion routine drain removal . Endpoints : 1 . Assessment post-operative pain use Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 1 hour , 2 hour , 4 hour , 6 hour , 8 hour , day 1 , day 2 day 3 post operatively . 2 . Total opiate consumption first 24 hour ( manually convert morphine equivalent ) Resources : Consultant General Surgeons Middlemore Hospital Consultant anaesthetist : Dr. Nicholas Lightfoot Patients : approximately 85 LVHR procedure perform MSC per year . Manukau Surgical Centre staff facility University Auckland facility AutoFuser pain pump Ropivacaine ( 0.2 % ) - Naropin Normal Saline ( 0.9 )</detailed_description>
