	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease important cause morbidity mortality industrialize world . Abnormalities coagulation system , cause hypercoagulable state , know risk factor arterial venous thrombosis . The contact activation system part coagulation system consist four protein : coagulation factor XII ( FXII ) , FXI , prekallikrein high molecular weight kininogen ( HMWK ) . Clinical study indicate important role contact activation system risk arterial thrombosis . Furthermore , substantial evidence mouse study FXII FXI participate formation stability thrombus . In vitro study show collagen , present vascular wall , able activate FXII hereby stimulate thrombin formation potentiate formation platelet-fibrin thrombus FXIIa able change structure fibrin clot bind fibrin ( ogen ) generation additional thrombin . However , contact system also participate process fibrinolysis , degrade thrombus . The investigator would like investigate contribution contact activation system formation thrombus . The formation thrombus within vascular bed main cause occlusion artery vein , lead infarct heart attack . Due function contact system important fully understand contact system contribute thrombus formation , use target treatment arterial thrombosis . The aim study determine contribution protein contact system , mainly FXII FXI , platelet mediate formation degradation thrombus . This study flow model ( perfusion-flow model Chandler loop ) , static model ( ROTEM® ) use thrombin generation assay .</brief_summary>
