	<brief_summary>This study investigate novel magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) system design GEHC image viable neonate infant population . This MR system small size design feature may make feasible locate system close proximity care area neonate ( birth - 1 month ) infant ( &gt; 1 month two year ) , clinical neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) infant neonatal care department . This two-phase prospective clinical study evaluate performance safety investigational MRI device neonate infant , include : - Phase 1 - Initial feasibility assessment optimization study ( Phase 1 ) may include hardware software modification . These study guide series MR scanning procedure define sequential Sponsor-provided MR Procedure Documents - Phase 2 - Controlled image data collection study base Phase 1 result , optimized scan procedure ( ) accord MR Procedure Document ( ) provide start Phase 2 scan fix hardware integrate software configuration apply subject . Investigator feedback scan conduct MR Procedure Document document . Because device intend use viable neonate infant population , clinical data require conducted population simulate non-human model . Clinical image associate data well assessment image quality , workflow , usability collect . Images , associate image data , subject data collect phase study may use future engineering development activity support MR product development , include Sponsor-authorized scientific marketing activity . Summary evaluation safety performance Phase 1 Phase 2 may use support regulatory submission , include filing European CE mark .</brief_summary>
