	<brief_title>Swiss HCVree Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection increase HIV-positive men sex men ( MSM ) participate Swiss HIV Cohort Study ( SHCS ) . MSM high-risk sexual behaviour recognize main driver current HCV epidemic . However , Switzerland treatment newest available direct act agent ( DAAs ) currently restrict patient METAVIR fibrosis score ≥2 ( i.e. , patient begin advanced liver fibrosis cirrhosis ) federal office public health due tremendous cost DAAs . Within study population ( i.e . HIV-infected MSM replicate HCV-infection Switzerland ) , 90 % individual METAVIR fibrosis score &lt; 2 . As consequence , HCV therapy new DAAs cover health insurance majority population . However , evidence HCV treatment delay development advance liver disease . Treating HIV/HCV-coinfected individual independently liver fibrosis score prevent development liver related complication transmission HCV infection . The daily oral combination regimen grazoprevir/elbasvir approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) January 2016 treatment genotype ( GT ) 1 4 HCV infection mono- HIV/HCV coinfected patient . In phase III clinical trial , 12-week course grazoprevir/elbasvir show high efficacy sustain virologic response ( SVR ) rate ≥95 % , favourable tolerability . A 16 week treatment grazoprevir/elbasvir combination weight-adjusted ribavirin necessary GT 1a infect patient baseline resistance associate variant ( RAV 's ) GT 4 infected patient history prior failure HCV-treatment . Grazoprevir/elbasvir robust data phase 2 3 clinical trial GT 1 , 4 HCV infection . Of note , GT 1 , 4 infection account ~90 % HCV infection MSM population SHCS . HCV reinfection remain concern among MSM , re-exposed HCV high-risk sexual behaviour successful HCV treatment . A recent review show evidence behavioural intervention high risk MSM potential effective least short term reduction sexual risk behaviour . To date knowledge HCV-specific immune response DAA treatment sparse . An effective adaptive cellular immunity know play crucial role spontaneous viral eradication primary infection . The investigator aim investigate efficacy grazoprevir/elbasvir ±ribavirin HIV-positive MSM participate SHCS broader set coinfected MSM . The study pursues comprehensive approach treat , counsel cure strategy explore impact strategy representative HIV/HCV-coinfected MSM population . This study nest project Swiss HIV Cohort Study entitle `` The Swiss HCVree Trial '' .</detailed_description>
