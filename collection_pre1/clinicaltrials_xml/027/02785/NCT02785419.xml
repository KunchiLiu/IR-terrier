	<brief_summary>After stroke , individual often persistent difficulty use arm hand everyday functional task reduces quality life . Currently available rehabilitation technique adequate new protocol need base understanding brain region work together produce skilled movement . This research project aim improve understand brain control movement stroke determine whether period motor practice target specific brain region addition action selection demand lead improved arm function . We hypothesize arm motor function ability efficiently activate action selection motor circuit movement improve training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Action Selection Arm Rehabilitation After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rehabilitation arm impairment stroke include repetitive practice functional task . In healthy adult , plan play vital role control skilled movement , however , behavioral neural correlate plan largely unexplored individual recover stroke . Action selection important motor planning process engage dorsal premotor cortex ( PMd ) control . While PMd activation commonly report neural correlate motor recovery stroke , role PMd action selection motor train know . Therefore , purpose study determine effect train include action selection demand behavioral neural correlate movement stroke . Thirty-eight individual chronic phase stroke recruit . After completion clinical measure impairment function , participant stroke complete motor action selection task functional MRI follow arm training . Arm training consist three week ( 15 session ) arm motor training ( 1.5 hour per session ) include action selection demand movement . Follow-up clinical test occur end treatment three week later .</detailed_description>
