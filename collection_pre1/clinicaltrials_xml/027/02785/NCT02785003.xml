	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness ketamine infusion management acute pain follow open laparoscopic colorectal surgery case . Half patient receive institutional standard care placebo infusion ( active medication ) . The half patient receive institutional standard care ketamine infusion . All subject staff blind whether receive placebo ketamine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized , double blind clinical trial ketamine use adult colorectal surgery patient conduct . The experimental arm trial receive ketamine infusion therapy control arm trial receives saline placebo infusion equivalent rate . All patient enrol trial enrol standardize Enhanced Recovery Surgery ( ERAS ) pathway include intravenous opioid medication breakthrough pain , schedule acetaminophen , NSAIDs indicate . All patient manage accordance appropriate Division Trauma Acute Care Surgery Division Colorectal Surgery policy . Potential participant screen time outpatient clinic visit . Patients require operative intervention management colonic disease , malignant non-malignant , eligible enrollment . Individuals present emergency department evaluate previously mention division screen eligibility . If potential participant qualifies enrollment , approach one IRB approve study staff consent . Prior randomization formal enrollment , investigational drug service pharmacist screen contraindication potential ketamine therapy . Following investigator pharmacy approval , patient randomize Investigational Drug Services ( IDS ) . The two trial arm randomize 1:1 control experimental fashion randomization block conduct set 4 patient . Participants enrol trial undergo randomization either experimental control arm IDS department time presentation hospital . The infusate prepared IDS department ketamine concentration 500mg/250ml IV bag label `` Investigational Ketamine / Placebo - PRO27024 '' prior dispersal pre-operative nurse . All elective surgery patient receive alvimopan begin pre-operative area administer RN least 30 minute prior administration narcotic medication . A total 60 patient enrolled ( see sample size calculation c.2.3 ) , 30 arm . All infusion rate calculate base ideal body weight ( IBW ) , unless actual body weight ( ABW ) less ideal . IBW calculate male 50kg + 2.3* ( number inch 5 foot ) females 45.5kg + 2.3* ( number inch 5 foot ) . All investigational infusion start anesthesia resident Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists ( CRNA ) time anesthesia induction . Patients receive bolus investigational solution calculate dose 0.25 mg/kg 5 minute follow anesthetic induction . A continuous infusion investigational solution immediately follow rate 2 mcg/kg/min . Timing bolus administration along time initiation continuous infusion document continuous infusion run duration 48-hours . All subject assess daily frequently delirium . The institutional CAM CAM-ICU Delirium screen , validated literature , utilized ( see appendix IV V ) . Subjects may remove oneself trial un-blinded he/she , pharmacy , and/or clinical staff deem medically necessary . Medical necessity determine inability treat without knowledge trial assignment ; otherwise treat staff assume patient receive ketamine . All adverse event record necessary subject un-blinded event serious adverse event . All adverse event record necessary subject un-blinded event serious adverse event . The research team monitor study patient adverse event trend . Patients follow time discharge .</detailed_description>
