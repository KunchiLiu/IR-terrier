	<brief_title>Epidemiologic Multicenter Prospective Study Advanced NSCLC ( Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ) Patients With PDL1 ( Protein Death Ligand 1 ) Expression .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few data publish clinical pathological characteristic advance NSCLC high PDL1 expression compare weak expression population . There moment standard test determine relevant target population . Preliminary data show around 25 % NSCLC population may high PDL1 expression may great benefit anti PDL1 therapy . But fact limited data publish European population clinical pathological characteristic ( high PDL1 expression ) compare weak expression expression population . More prognosis rule high PDL1 expression NSCLC definitive , study indicate positive prognostic factor study show negative prognostic factor . To understand difference term prognostic advance NSCLC high low/no expression PDL1 major challenge future management strategy patient . The result study help elaborate new guideline population . Therefore also important data 's natural course disease population building cost effectiveness model new immune therapy .</detailed_description>
