	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial Compare Treatment Mild Acute Diverticulitis With Without Antibiotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last year , traditional pathologic mechanism acute diverticulitis question replace scientifically grounded hypothesis strongly postulate inflammatory origin . Local pro-inflammatory cytokine , microbiota shift , disturb neurological intestinal signalling due alteration colonic neuropeptides abnormal colonic motility propose potential etiologic factor . Recent publication , therefore , call question benefit antibiotic treatment episode acute diverticulitis , especially mild episode . Furthermore , recent international guideline endorse stance recommendation . Moreover , recent study provide evidence regard security treat patient mild acute diverticulitis outpatient . The investigator think outpatient treatment without antibiotic mild acute diverticulitis not-inferior traditional treatment antibiotic , measure efficacy readmission ratio . For reason design multicentric , randomise , prospective study . All patient see emergency department clinical sign acute diverticulitis ( left iliac fossa abdominal pain , peritoneal irritation sign and/or leucocytosis ) undergo abdominal compute tomography confirm diagnosis grade disease accord severity use modify Neff ( mNeff ) classification . Those mild acute diverticulitis ( grade 0 ) , follow inclusion criterion give informed consent , include study protocol randomly assign one treatment arm : symptomatic treatment NSAID plus antibiotic v symptomatic treatment NSAID . They followed-up 48 hour , 7 day , 30 day 3 month onset episode . Primary goal determine , mild acute diverticulitis , treatment without antibiotic not-inferior traditional treatment antibiotic consider readmission ratio . Secondary goal include analysis difference group , case , relation number reason reconsultation , reason readmission ( bad symptom control , radiologic progression , analysis worsening ) , pain control ( analogic visual scale ) , recuperation acute episode , complication rate treatment .</detailed_description>
