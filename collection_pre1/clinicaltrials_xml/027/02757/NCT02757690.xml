	<brief_summary>Traditionally , laparoscopy base 2-dimensional ( 2D ) imaging , represent considerable challenge approach technique . Thus , 3-dimensional ( 3D ) visualization technology laparoscopy propose , since early 1990s , way facilitate laparoscopic performance . However , early 3D laparoscopic technology limit term image quality , use implement . More recently , industry develop novel 3D system image similar stereoscopic vision , depth perception achieve different unique image receive eye . Thus , recent study suggest possible advantage provide new 3D system laparoscopic performance . However , comparative assessment new generation 3D v 2D laparoscopy remain limited , especially hepatobiliary pancreatic field . To assess benefit harm use three dimensional system versus two dimensional system laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedures 1. investigator take patient consent clinical trial . 2 . The participant divide two group block randomize method 3 . Skillful pancreatic surgeon perform 2D 3D laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy . 4 . The participant monitor intraoperative postoperative course . Data collection 1. operation video : operation time , number error ( missed grasp , loss material ) 1 . Segmental operation time accord procedure 2 . Numbers error operation 2. clinical parameter : 1 . Blood examination : complete blood count ( hemoglobin , white blood cell count ) , amylase , lipase , etc . 2 . Radiological examination : X-ray , Computed Tomography ( CT ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , etc 3 . Medical record : hospital stay operation , time eating , pathologic examination 3 . Subjective score view operator , 1st assist . 1 . Scoring image quality 2 . Scoring harm 3D/2D laparoscopic system 3 . Scoring overall demand</detailed_description>
