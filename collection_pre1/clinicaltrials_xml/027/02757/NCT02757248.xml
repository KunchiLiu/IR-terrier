	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , unblinded single arm Phase I multi-center trial determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination volasertib romidepsin patient relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell ( PTCL ) cutaneous T cell ( CTCL ) lymphoma . Primary Objectives : 1 . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination romidepsin volasertib patient relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell cutaneous T cell lymphoma . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) combination romidepsin volasertib patient relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell cutaneous cell lymphoma . 2 . Define gene expression signature pattern acquire tumor mutation dynamically correlate clinical response romidepsin/volasertib combination therapy cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) longitudinal RNA sequence tumor sample . Dose Combinations ( -1 ) : Volasertib 50mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8 ; Romidepsin 10mg/m2 Days 1 , 8 &amp; 15 ( 1-starting dose ) : Volasertib 75mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8 ; Romidepsin 12mg/m2 Days 1 , 8 &amp; 15 ( 2 ) : Volasertib 100mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8 ; Romidepsin 12mg/m2 Days 1 , 8 15 ( 3 ) : Volasertib 100mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8 ; Romidepsin 14mg/m2 Days 1 , 8 15 ( 4 ) : Volasertib 150mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8 ; Romidepsin 14mg/m2 Days 1 , 8 15 Each cycle 28 day Each drug give intravenously</detailed_description>
