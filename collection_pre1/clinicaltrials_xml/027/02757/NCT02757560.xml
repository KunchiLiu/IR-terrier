	<brief_summary>The overall goal proposal use saturate fatty acid ( SFA ) - enrich , high fat diet rapidly induce insulin resistance ( IR ) provide insight underlie proximal mechanism reduce insulin signaling . Specifically , investigator identify initial change metabolite concentrations/or pathway signaling ( `` pathway '' use broadly refer mechanism specific measure ) therefore mechanism likely responsible development IR high fat nutritional challenge . Investigators assemble multidisciplinary team verse dietary study , fatty acid metabolism , measurement IR potential mechanism mediator IR , experience work monocyte two tissue , muscle adipose tissue , particularly relevant understanding effect high fat diet IR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In first aim , investigator test whether short-term high SFA-diet induces increase insulin resistance participant normal abnormal glucose tolerance , respectively , determine associate change muscle , adipose tissue inflammatory cell composition , pathway activation insulin signal . Investigators identify change specific signal pathway within tissue cell hypothesize mediate modulate insulin action . Primary mechanism pathway examine include local tissue systemic inflammation , formation bioactive lipid intermediate , generation endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress , mitochondrial dysfunction/reactive oxygen formation . By perform study participant normal glucose tolerance abnormal glucose tolerance investigator also determine whether extent mechanism insulin resistance vary initial degree glucose intolerance . In second aim , determine extent mechanism insulin resistance vary dietary composition , investigator determine whether diet similar caloric content SFA-diet , enrich monounsaturated fatty acid carbohydrate , also induce insulin resistance whether similar different mechanistic pathway responsible . Identifying similarity difference diet inflammatory cell tissue change compare relationship peripheral tissue insulin action clarify cell tissue event closely link development insulin resistance . In final aim , identify temporal sequence mechanistic pathway insulin resistance role cell tissue cross-talk event , investigator evaluate inflammatory cell , skeletal muscle adipose tissue composition pathway change acute , subacute , chronic dietary challenge individual . This also permit assessment whether repeat dietary challenge create change tissue resemble find chronic advanced state insulin resistance .</detailed_description>
