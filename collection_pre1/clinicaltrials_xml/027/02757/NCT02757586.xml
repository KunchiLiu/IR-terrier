	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common adult leukemia characterize extensive accumulation monoclonal , relatively mature CD5+CD23+ B lymphocytes lymphoid organ , bone marrow , peripheral blood . CLL cell accumulate defective apoptosis , extend survival . CLL heterogeneous disease . Chemoimmunotherapy standard front-line approach patient young 65 year CLL , combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab use commonly . Some CLL patient respond well routine chemoimmunotherapy . Despite recent advance treatment CLL use modern chemoimmunotherapy , disease remain incurable patient exception option allogeneic transplantation . However , treatment chemoimmunotherapy associate significant toxicity sustain immunosuppression , rate myelosuppression infection high . Such complication frequent severe patient older 65 year reduce marrow reserve , presence comorbidities . Because CLL disease elderly , identify effective therapy well toxicity profile thus high priority , target therapy may allow attainment goal . CLL tumor cell highly dependent microenvironment cytokine ( eg , CD40L , BAFF , IL-4 , IL-6 ) , contact ( eg , stromal cell ) promote cell activation proliferation , also resistance spontaneous drug-mediated apoptosis . Many microenvironment-activated pathway merge TSPs export XPO1 . XPO1 therefore highly attractive molecular target explore CLL , impact multiple antitumor growth suppressive signaling pathway dysregulated disease . The investigator therefore hypothesize selective XPO1 inhibitor would show efficacy acceptable therapeutic index CLL diseases . Indeed , XPO1 inhibition normal cell ( ie , possess intact genome ) lead transient cell cycle arrest without cytotoxicity , follow fast recovery drug remove . To date , effort clinically pharmacologically inhibit XPO1 unsuccessful off-target effect . A selective XPO1 antagonist may allow target TSPs ax tumor cell .</detailed_description>
