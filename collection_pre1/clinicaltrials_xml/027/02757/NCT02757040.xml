	<brief_title>Combination Ibrutinib As2O3 Treatment CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common adult leukemia characterize extensive accumulation monoclonal , relatively mature , positives cluster differentiation antigen 5 cluster differentiation antigen 23 B lymphocyte lymphoid organ , bone marrow , peripheral blood . CLL cell accumulate defective apoptosis , extend survival . CLL heterogeneous disease . Chemoimmunotherapy standard front-line approach patient young 65 year CLL , combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab use commonly . Some CLL patient respond well routine chemoimmunotherapy . Despite recent advance treatment CLL use modern chemoimmunotherapy , disease remain incurable patient exception option allogeneic transplantation . However , treatment chemoimmunotherapy associate significant toxicity sustain immunosuppression , rate myelosuppression infection high . Such complication frequent severe patient older 65 year reduce marrow reserve , presence comorbidities . Because CLL disease elderly , identify effective therapy well toxicity profile thus high priority , target therapy may allow attainment goal . Ibrutinib irreversible inhibitor Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) bind covalently cysteine residue ( C481 ) kinase domain . This inhibition show vitro induce modest CLL cell apoptosis abolish proliferation B-cell receptor ( BCR ) signal . Clinical trial result agent outstanding , include estimate 26-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) 75 % patient relapsed refractory disease . Although PFS ibrutinib excellent , overall response rate group relapse patient 71 % , lag behind clinical benefit see 88 % patient lymphocytosis induce agent agent target BCR pathway . Nevertheless , long-term safety ibrutinib establish . Caution must exercise development resistant clone due persistence disease , patient treat ibrutinib often prolong partial remission . Moreover , 2-5 % CLL patient develop Richter 's syndrome transformation disease course treatment . The rate serious adverse event patient continue treatment 1 year longer 43 % first year treatment 32 % first year . Within first year treatment , 8 % patient discontinue therapy , 6 % discontinue therapy first year . Besides , consider genetic mutation cause resistance ibrutinib CLL patient alter signal pathway common mechanism resistance single agent . It 's expect combine agent ibrutinib obtain high response CLL patient obtain perfect effect relieve toxicity treatment ibrutinib . However , arsenic trioxide ( As2O3 ) attract worldwide interest field oncology substantial anticancer activity patient acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . Interestingly , number study reveal As2O3 induce apoptosis , APL , also wide variety hematologic malignancy , include CLL , either monotherapy combine therapy . Investigators previous study also suggest As2O3 could induce CLL cell apoptosis , could efficient therapeutic agent CLL .</detailed_description>
