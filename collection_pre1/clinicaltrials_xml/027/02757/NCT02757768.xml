	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability Mirabegron Men With OAB Symptoms While Taking Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ( LUTS ) Due Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At Screening ( Visit 1 ) , subject enter 4-week open label tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg QD run-in period prior randomize 12-week double-blind treatment period ( Visit 2 ) . At conclusion 4-week tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period , subject complete 3-day diary prior Baseline ( Visit 2 ) . Approximately 7 day prior Visit 2 subject receive phone call remind diary answer question . If subject meet entry criterion end tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period , subject randomize 1 2 treatment group ( mirabegron placebo ) 12 week treatment addition continuation tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg QD . Those subject randomize mirabegron start 25 mg increase 50 mg 4 week . Those subject randomize placebo start blind product match mirabegron 25 mg tablet increase blind product match 50 mirabegron 4 week . Once subject increase dose , subject remain dose remainder study unless safety reason require discontinue study drug . A training diary complete first 2 week tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period . During evaluation period least one telephone contact take place subject . Diaries complete home , use electronic patient-reported outcome ( ePRO ) device , 3 consecutive day prior visit : Baseline ( Visit 2 ) , Week 4 ( Visit 3 ) , Week 8 ( Visit 4 ) , Week 12/End Treatment ( Visit 5 ) . Site staff contact subject approximately 7 day prior schedule visit remind subject complete electronic diary , review completion instruction review change concomitant medication adverse event ( applicable ) . Three day Visits 2 ( Baseline ) , 3 ( Week 4 ) , 4 ( Week 8 ) , 5 ( Week 12 ) , subject complete 3-day diary , use ePRO device subject record micturition frequency , urgency ( PPIUS ) , incontinence volume void . In addition , diary capture morning even blood pressure pulse rate measurement via Home Blood Pressure Monitoring ( HBPM ) . At Visit 1 , International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) complete . At Visits 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , subject complete IPSS , EQ-5D-5L , OAB-q , PPBC , TS-VAS . Maximum urinary flow ( Qmax ) measure Visit 1 ( Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in ) Visit 5 ( Week 12/End Treatment ) . Post-void residual volume ( PVR ) assess Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in ( Visit 1 ) , Baseline ( Visit 2 ) Week 4 ( Visit 3 ) , Week 8 ( Visit 4 ) , Week 12/End Treatment ( Visit 5 ) . A follow-up phone call ( Visit 6 ) conduct 4-weeks End Treatment ( Visit 5 ) . Total study participation approximately 20 week .</detailed_description>
