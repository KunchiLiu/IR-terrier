	<brief_title>Top-down Versus Bottom-up Transvaginal Ultrasound Scan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Ultrasonography consider safe highly operator dependent . Ultrasonography use increasingly gynecology obstetrics ; however training novice transvaginal ultrasound perform differently respect orientation ultrasound image , often differ operator institution . The image may orient top- ( transducer top ) bottom-up ( transducer bottom ) . The different orientation image challenge novice supervise senior clinician different preference image orientation . As , international consensus image orientation evidence support superiority one term learn curve educational outcome skill transfer . Transvaginal ultrasound , like kind ultrasound , associate long learn curve therefore time-consuming require extensive training . Transvaginal ultrasound often associate discomfort patient , reduce adequate initial training . It therefore seem reasonable determine provide effective initial transvaginal ultrasound training reduce unnecessary patient discomfort improve diagnostic accuracy accelerate learn curve . A recent study involve laparoscopic training , suggest novice learn best simplified practice initial skill acquisition allow deal future task complexity well face complex image orientation . These finding consistent cognitive load theory , emphasize limitation work memory learn new task . Optimal learn occurs cognitive load new task within limit learner 's work memory instructional feature contribute learn eliminate . Basic knobology ( operate ultrasound machine control ) image interpretation represent significant source cognitive load ultrasound novice acquisition image therefore simple possible avoid exceed work memory learner . When look ultrasound image , operator transforms two-dimensional ultrasound image three-dimensional internal representation structure examine . Alignment image accord physical angle transvaginal ultrasound probe image face bottom-up clinician perceive intuitive anatomical orientation . Other clinician prefer ultrasound image orient way ( top-down ) regardless type examination perform ( transabdominal transvaginal ) . The research question study : In group ultrasound novice , effect transvaginal ultrasound train orient image top-down versus bottom-up learn curve transfer skill different setting case ? Hypotheses : The investigator hypothesize orientation perceive ultrasound novice intuitive also result short learning curve improve transfer skill . This study may improve ultrasound novice ' learning ensure future clinician perform transvaginal ultrasound examination manner . If orientation image result change educational outcome , argument adopt one approach educational point-of-view . Participants Participants study medical student University Copenhagen , Denmark . Inclusion criterion require participant 1 ) medical student year 3 year 6 ; 2 ) previous ultrasound experience besides mandatory ultrasound course four hour provide 6th semester medical student University Copenhagen ; 3 ) provide write informed consent . Participants inclusion randomly divide two study group : 1 . Group one ( TD ) : Orienting transvaginal ultrasound image top-down 2 . Group two ( BU ) : Orienting transvaginal ultrasound image bottom-up Randomization An independent research fellow Copenhagen Academy Medical Education Simulation , Rigshospitalet , randomize participant computer either two group . Intervention Before training commence , participant survey intuitive preference image orientation . Participants group receive short theoretical introduction pelvic ultrasound . Afterwards participant introduce simulated environment Virtual Reality ( VR ) simulator ( Scantrainer ) use training . The VR simulator provide image obtain real patient haptic feedback ultrasound probe . The study base principle mastery learning , thus participant instruct complete simulator test include number practice module reach expert level performance . The expert performance level establish previous validation study . Participants TD BU group instruct ultrasound image top-down bottom-up , respectively , throughout train assessment . When expert level reach participant perform transfer test low-fidelity simulator ( BluePhantom ) within 7 day complete simulator training . During transfer test participant ask complete systematic ultrasound examination optimize image scan . The performance videotape afterwards rat two clinician use perform transvaginal ultrasound - one clinician use see ultrasound image top-down clinician use see image bottom-up . The participant rat use Objective Structured Assessment Ultrasound Skills . After complete training , participant assess cognitive load use cognitive load questionnaire . All training assessment take place simulate set skill lab Copenhagen Academy Medical Education Simulation , Rigshospitalet . Outcomes Primary outcome : â€¢ The primary outcome measure include learn curve two group performance transfer test . Learning curve assess simulator score obtain practice module . A previous study demonstrate mastery learning level attain four five round train practice module include simulator test Secondary outcome : - Participants ' perception intuitive approach training . - Time use within two group reach expert level - Cognitive load measurement use instrument describe Leppink et al . training</detailed_description>
