	<brief_summary>The goal present clinical trial determine whether low frequency ( 0.5 Hz ) rTMS induce long term depression epileptogenic cortex thus suppress cortical excitability epileptic focus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators propose safety feasibility trial treat epilepsy ( Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Epilepsy . Principal Investigator : Robert Fisher , MD , PhD , Stanford University ) . In approach , cortical source epileptic discharge first localize dense array electroencephalography ( 256-channel dEEG ) . This localization register neuronavigator software allow precise target slow ( 0 . 5 Hz ) repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) STM9000 . The purpose feasibility study introduce Long Term Depression ( LTD ) seizure onset zone order reduce epileptiform discharge . The goal future pivotal trial extend approach suppress seizure . The fund trial provide Stanford University . A loan dEEG equipment consulting provide Electrical Geodesics , Inc. ( EGI ) . EGI seek FDA 's approval trial . EGI manufacturer dEEG system ( GES 400 ) US distributor EB Neuro STM9000 rTMS system ( manufactured Italy EB Neuro , S.p.A. ) . The eventual goal pivotal trial de novo 510k dEEG-guided rTMS suppress epileptic seizure . The limited goal suppress epileptic discharge ( spike ) allow careful evaluation safety demonstrate feasibility therapeutic action . In prepare request , investigator study guidance special control describe rTMS FDA Class II Special Controls Guidance Document : Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Systems , Document issue : July 26 , 2011 . In addition , patient epilepsy particular risk seizure may induce exacerbated rTMS , investigator also address unique risk population , exist evidence safety efficacy rTMS treatment epileptic focus , mitigation investigator propose minimize risk . EGI receive IDE safety feasibility trial treat epileptic discharge different method device , Geodesic Transcranial Electrical Neuromodulation ( GTEN 100 ) system . The primary difference present proposal use rTMS ( instead GTEN 100 ) induce long term depression thus suppression cortical excitability epileptic focus . Dr. Robert Fisher , Principal Investigator project , EGI 's unpaid consultant . Dr. Fisher receive IRB approval Stanford University Hospital large study title 10 patient dEEG-guided rTMS treatment focal epilepsy GES 400 STM9000 . The present trial safety feasibility study 10 patient conduct informed consent form specific safety feasibility study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Failure adequate seizure control prior use least 2 antiseizure drug . 2. least one clearly identify localizable likely seizure onset focus , define discharge ( typically epileptiform spike ) identify dEEG assessment one routine clinical dEEG evaluation . This focus must 2 3 cm head surface ( reachable TMS ) . Where multiple spike focus present meet criterion , focus either clinically relevant symptom spike ( ) choose target treatment . 3. two partial seizure , without secondary generalization , last month , less 10 seizure per day . 4 . Antiseizure drug regimen remain unchanged month study entry , reasonable likelihood stability duration study , exception allow shortterm rescue medication , lorazepam . 5. history epilepsy least 2 year . 6. age 22 year old . 1 . If childbearing potential , patient must agree use effective method birth control study cease participation pregnant . 2 . Nursing mother exclude . 3 . A history condition progressive brain disorder , serious systemic disease , symptomatic cerebrovascular disease , cardiac disease , alcohol abuse . Special condition , example , nonmalignant brain tumor vascular malformation , consider entry casebycase basis . Patients exclude basis previous psychiatric hospitalization suicide attempt . 4 . A history condition ( generalize ) status epilepticus psychogenic seizure . 5 . Presence cardiac pacemaker , vagus nerve stimulator , metal implantation body ( teeth ) include neurostimulators , cochlear implant , implanted medication pump . 6 .
