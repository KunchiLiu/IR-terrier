	<detailed_description>The purpose research study red blood cell ( RBCs ) survive person 's circulation , survival may different red blood cell donate stored prior transfuse . In study , blood collect healthy subject , process pack red blood cell unit , either immediately afterwards 40-42 day later pack red blood cell label biotin . The biotin-labeled red blood cell re-infused back donor ( autologous transfusion ) . Blood sample take subject every week 70 day ( 10 week ) track survival label red blood cell . This study also seek demonstrate biotin-labeled RBCs safely transfuse back autologous subject without adverse reaction . All participant follow watch development antibodies biotin-labeled RBCs .</detailed_description>
