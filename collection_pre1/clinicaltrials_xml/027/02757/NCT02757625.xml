[ Elective surgical case ] Subjects require least 6 hour respiratory management intubation intensive care immediately surgery anticipated require sedation . 5 . [ Medical ICU case ] Subjects require least 24 hour respiratory management intubation intensive care anticipate require sedation . For medical ICU case , sedative use prior treatment investigational product discontinue start treatment investigational product . 6 . If subject female childbearing potential , pregnant possibly pregnant , lactate . 1 .

Subjects acute febrile illness [ temperature ( core tympanic ) ≥ 38.0°Centigrade ] screen visit . 9 . Subjects receive investigational product within 30 day baseline subject participate study use investigational product study period . 10 . Subjects receive dexmedetomidine within 48 hour baseline . 11 . Subjects , opinion investigator subinvestigator , may increase risk subject due conduct study may disease factor probably preclude obtainment sufficient study data . 12 . Subjects , opinion investigator subinvestigator , risk involve administration dexmedetomidine outweigh benefit ( e.g. , &gt; 2 dos vasopressor due cardiogenic shock ) . 13 .
