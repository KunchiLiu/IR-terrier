	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation demonstrate evidence-base medicine reduce pulmonary complication thoracic surgery . According literature review , study specifically point proper timing intervention pulmonary rehabilitation patient thoracic surgery ; moreover , intervention pulmonary rehabilitation focus long-term training study . The purpose study determine whether Pulmonary rehabilitation effective patient thoracic surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impacts Pulmonary Rehabilitation Therapy Patients After Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary-related surgery remain potential risk accord previous evidence-based study . Particularly , individual 65 year age smoking , chronic pulmonary disease , wheezy , cardiovascular comorbidities , upper respiratory infection high risk pulmonary complication surgery , account approximately 2 % 40 % occurrence rate . For instance , atelectasis , pneumonia , bronchospasm , chronic pulmonary disease , fluid accumulation lung cavity , lung edema , hypoxemia , acute upper airway obstruction , respiratory failure common problem patient clinic . Therefore , intervention-related study way reduce pulmonary complication operation improve physio- psychological recovery significantly mean process care patient thoracic surgery . Pulmonary rehabilitation demonstrate evidence-base medicine reduce pulmonary complication thoracic surgery increase breathing capacity mean smoke cession operation , breathe exercise , extremity exercise , breathe muscle training , incentive spirometry ( Triflo-II ) training , intermittent positive pressure ventilation , chest physical therapy . According literature review , study specifically point proper timing intervention pulmonary rehabilitation patient thoracic surgery ; moreover , intervention pulmonary rehabilitation focus long-term training study . Thus , study design randomize control trial recruit patient thoracic surgery wedge resection , segmental resection , lobectomy , total lung resection compare effectiveness pulmonary rehabilitation patient chest surgery operation stage op-day 3 day op-day 2 week long-term train discharge 2 week , 6 week 12 week . In addition , study discover effectiveness pulmonary function operation , breathe strength , pulmonary complication pain , dyspnea degree , also presume pulmonary rehabilitation improve physio- psychological recovery .</detailed_description>
