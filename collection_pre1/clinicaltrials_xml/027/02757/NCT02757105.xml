	<brief_title>Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Trial BEKINDA ( Ondansetron 12 mg Bimodal Release Tablets ) Diarrhea Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS-D )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient undergo baseline evaluation include full history physical , particular attention gastrointestinal symptomatology finding , standard set safety laboratory examination ( CBC platelet count , biochemical profile , urinalysis , serum TSH free T4 , INR ) , 12-lead ECG . In addition , follow study perform exclude cause gastrointestinal symptom : - Serum test C-reactive protein gluten sensitivity - Colonoscopy require per protocol - Patients history positive test ova , parasites Clostridium difficile must undergo repeat testing , must negative , screen period . Starting baseline observation phase , patient keep diary symptomatology stool frequency consistency . Stool consistency assess accord Bristol Stool Form scale ( Lewis Heaton , 1997 ) . Patients keep diary stool frequency consistency , symptom , study medication compliance , use medication , include rescue medication , throughout study . Serum electrolyte assay ( bicarbonate , calcium , chloride , magnesium , potassium , sodium ) perform week 3 study . Safety laboratory examination perform treatment period accordance study procedure schedule . Patients question periodically regard concomitant medication use occurrence adverse event . Patients must complete least 12 day baseline diary entry within 14 day screen period eligible participate study . Patients complete few 12 day diary entry may , investigator 's discretion , repeat screening period diary . As long patent complete enter study within 6 week , baseline laboratory study need repeat . If repeat 2 week ' baseline diary result period longer 6 week consent start treatment , medical monitor must consult prior randomization .</detailed_description>
