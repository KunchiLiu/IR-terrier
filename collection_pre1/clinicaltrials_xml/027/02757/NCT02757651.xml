	<brief_summary>This study aim test commonly available inexpensive chemical ( hydrogen peroxide ) safety activity sensitise large cancerous lump breast standard course radiotherapy woman poorly control symptom . Laboratory research initial clinical trial Japan suggest 4 6 injection radiation sensitiser ( 'KORTUC ' ) base dilute ( 0.5 % ) hydrogen peroxide inject cancer local anaesthetic twice week radiotherapy greatly increase effectiveness standard dose radiotherapy alone . The side effect limited mild/moderate discomfort injection site 24 hour report Japanese breast cancer patient treatment test . Complete tumour shrinkage 70/71 ( 98 % ) primary breast cancer 5 cm diameter report Japanese collaborator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : To test slow release gel contain commonly available inexpensive chemical ( hydrogen peroxide ) safety activity sensitize large cancerous lump breast armpit standard 3-week course radiotherapy woman poorly control symptom . Background : Laboratory research initial clinical trial conduct Japan raise possibility simple inexpensive treatment base dilute ( 0.5 % ) hydrogen peroxide inject cancer local anaesthetic greatly increase effectiveness standard dose radiotherapy . The side effect appear limited mild/moderate discomfort injection site 24 hour one-third patient . Rapid , complete durable tumour disappearance report 49/55 bulky breast cancer Japanese woman treat use approach , response least 3 time success rate radiotherapy alone patient contemporary Japanese control population . The inventor , Prof Ogawa Kochi University , approach investigator lead clinical evaluation commercial development , start propose early phase trial test safety anti-cancer activity describe . Design method : After numb skin local anaesthetic , specialist doctor ( radiologist ) train radiographer use ultrasound guide injection small volume dilute ( 0.5 % ) hydrogen peroxide solution tumour twice week 3 week standard radiotherapy . The drug suspend natural gel ( 1 % sodium hyaluronate , license treat stiff knee joint ) ensure slow release 48 hour . The injection procedure last 10-15 minute altogether . Tiny oxygen bubble release hydrogen peroxide help radiologist guide injection drug proper place skin . The investigator want test approach , start careful study side effect 12 patient ( pilot study ) follow randomised trial 84 patient test activity cancer ( Phase II ) . Patients participate Phase II either standard radiotherapy radiotherapy plus drug test . Neither patient doctor choose treatment , allocate randomly . Review Pilot study data independent committee expert complete start phase II ( efficacy ) study . Patient public involvement : Independent Cancer Patient Voice , patient advocate group field cancer , collaborate investigator research plan , comment advise content clarity write proposal . This group play prominent role promote UK clinical research , represent Trial Management Groups several national randomise cancer clinical trial . Dissemination : The result study presented scientific meeting meeting patient advocate group order judge result safety activity promise enough justify take research .</detailed_description>
