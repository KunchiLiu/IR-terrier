	<brief_summary>This prospective collection pre-defined parameter treatment male stress urinary incontinence artificial urinary sphincter ( AUS ) male sling . The data collection undertaken multiple center Europe . The participation open invitation member Female &amp; Functional Section EAU ( ESFFU ) along urologist undertake procedure . There call via European Association urology ( EAU ) European Urologists register database entry . There restriction number patient enrol long consecutive . The aim long term collection data set many center possible . An initial assessment robustness data collection undertaken 3 month nominate steer committee . However , first clinical evaluation data collect commence 1 year steer committee . Thereafter , evaluation perform every 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STATISTICS 1 . Number Participants : Investigators anticipate recruit patient least 20 European Centers prospectively collect data 400 - 500 patient per year . Statistical analysis perform total number participant . Based available literature , anticipate average cure rate 50 % AUS male sling average cure rate 65 % end study . With estimate sample size 350 patient treat Artificial Urethral Sphincter ( AUS ) 150 patient male sling , take account attrition rate 10-15 % , able detect 50 % cure rate 6 % either side 95 % Confidence Interval AUS ( proportion 0,50 95 % Confidence Intervals : 0,44-0,56 ) 65 % cure rate patient treat male sling ( proportion 0,65 95 % Confidence Intervals : 0,57-0,74 ) . 2 . Statistical Analysis : No adjustment procedures imputation miss data take place . 2.1 Patient characteristic : Patient characteristic age , weight , length , etc . summarize use descriptive statistic - number patient non-missing data , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum present continuous outcome , number percentage patient category present categorical outcome . A subgroup analysis Device subtype carry . 2.2 Primary endpoint analysis : Cure rate main endpoint study , define urinary continence need use pad use 1 light security pad . The cure rate 5 year study follow calculate together 95 % Confidence Intervals , total patient group well device subtype . 2.3 Secondary endpoint analysis : Time Incontinence-free secondary endpoint study , define interval date regain continence surgery date incontinence . Continence define pad use one light security pad per 24 hour use . Patients die censored time death . Overall time incontinence-free present use Kaplan-Meier curve , total patient group well device subtype . Time revision-free another endpoint study , define interval date surgery date revision . Patients die censored time death . Overall time revision-free present use Kaplan-Meier curve , total patient group well device subtype . The result questionnaires ICIQ Male LUTS Questionnaire SF EQ-5D-5L analyse compare baseline 12 week post-surgery yearly follow result whole group device subgroup . Further , complication ( SADE 's ) , pain symptoms post-surgery post-operative data evaluate device subgroup . 2.4 Prognostic factor : Univariable multivariable analysis carry identify clinical surgical variable correlate ( ) continence revision device subtypes . STUDY CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS A research co-coordinator available center obtain Ethics Committees ( ECs ) approval deliver logistics patient screening , follow-up visit , data collection data entry electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) . 1 . Regulatory Ethical Considerations : Prior initiation study site , research co-coordinator obtain approval appropriate regulatory agency ECs conduct study accordance applicable country-specific regulatory requirement . The study conduct accordance applicable subject privacy requirement . 2 . Recruitment Consent : A patient information sheet consent form available translated local language . This form state data process anonymously handle accord local data protection law . In case patient eligible , physician verbally inform patient registry purpose . The patient also receive write patient information sheet local language explain registry . The patient give ample opportunity ask question might . The patient give much time need consider participation registry . If patient agrees participate , informed consent form sign prior registration patient data . ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS AND PUBLICATION 1 . Handling Storage Data Documents : All item describe protocol entered eCRF . The physician guarantee team member person involve center respect confidentiality information concern registry patient . All party involve registry maintain strict confidentiality assure neither person family privacy patient participate registry violate . Likewise , appropriate measure shall take avoid access non-authorized person registry data . Data make anonymous extract anonymized data accessible report statistical analysis . The process personal data patient take part registry , particular regard data concern consent , shall comply local law privacy European Directive Privacy data ( 95/46/EC ) . 2 . Site Audit : Site audit conduct European Association Urology Foundation Urological Research ( EAU RF ) another designate third party approximately 5-10 % site . To avoid fraud , spot check monitor source data verification conduct identify patient really exist data enter database retrieve real patient file transfer correctly . 3 . Project Database : For purpose study , data store central database hold ESFFU umbrella EAU RF . The investigator qualify employee enter relevant patient data web base electronic Data Capture system . Data check , program data capture system , use predefined rule range consistency data field registry . Data also check accuracy correctness data-managers EAU RF accord internal procedure . The site capable modify data assure accuracy source documentation . At end study , EAU RF archive study data accordance internal procedure . Specific instruction use eCRF system include train material provide investigational site . 4 . Amendments : Amendments change make registry protocol . Amendments notify submit approval Ethical Committee ( EC ) require accord local law . 5 . Annual Progress Report : According local requirement , sponsor submit summary progress registry participate physician research coordinator submission local ECs ( require ) country year . Information provide date inclusion first patient , number patient include number patient complete registry , issue , amendment . 6 . End Registry Report : According local requirement , sponsor physician notify Competent Authority ( CA ) , Central Ethical Committee ( CEC ) local ECs end study . The registry end decision take ESFFU EAU RF . In case registry end , sponsor physician notify CA/CEC local ECs ( require ) , include reason premature termination . Within one year end registry , sponsor submit final registry report result registry , include publications/abstracts registry , CA/CEC local EC ( require ) . 7 . Steering Committee : A Steering Committee assemble , consist urologist key opinion leader field reconstructive surgery physicians/scientists clinical methodological expertise . The Steering Committee responsible assignment National Coordinators . Each participate country one National Coordinator select Steering Committee . The Steering Committee convene twice year .</detailed_description>
