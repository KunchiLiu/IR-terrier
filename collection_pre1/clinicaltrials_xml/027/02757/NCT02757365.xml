	<brief_summary>Though pathogenesis prostate cancer ( PCa ) still obscure , report , investigator previous study research , PCa often combine tissue inflammation closely related prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level . Inflammation could play important role process occurrence development PCa , however mechanism unknown . Inflammatory cytokine could mediate inflammatory reaction , also participate growth , proliferation , invasion progression tumor cell . It find non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , aspirin , effectively prevent several inflammation relate tumor , coincidentally , PCa also closely associated inflammation . Moreover , late research demonstrate hormone therapy could induce tissue inflammation PCa , large quantity immune B cell attract focal lot cytokine , IKK-β , NF-κB , release . These cytokine could inhibit apoptosis promote growth tumor cell , might possible mechanism long-term inflammatory infiltration induce occurrence PCa transformation castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Based proof , investigator presume could possibly effective way prevent occurrence PCa transformation androgen-dependent prostate cancer CRPC mean long-term oral aspirin . In study , investigator intend explore possible effect anti-inflammatory therapy progress transformation inflammation PCa androgen-dependent prostate cancer CRPC . Investigators plan conduct clinical trial four group , include control group , NSAIDs group , antibiotic group NSAIDs+antibiotics group , basic experiment vitro assess effectiveness anti-inflammatory drug elucidate specific molecular mechanism .</brief_summary>
