	<brief_summary>X-linked chronic granulomatous disease ( X-CGD ) rare genetic disorder , affect boy . It primary immunodeficiency disorder result inability white blood cell call phagocytic cell ( phagocyte ) kill invade bacteria fungi . These cell difficulty form free radical ( importantly superoxide radical due defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex ) important kill ingested pathogen . In X-CGD ( account two third CGD patient ) , defect lie gene make critical part NADPH-oxidase complex ( catalytic subunit ; gp91-phox protein ) . Therefore kill bacteria fungi poorly , patient suffer severe recurrent infection . This also result inflammation damage part body lung gut . In many case , patient adequately protected infection constant intake antibiotic . However , others , severe life-threatening infection break . In case , inflammation bowel urinary system result blockage treat antibiotic , may require use drug steroid . Development curative treatment CGD therefore great importance .</brief_summary>
