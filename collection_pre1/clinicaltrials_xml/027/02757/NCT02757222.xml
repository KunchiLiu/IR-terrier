	<brief_summary>The primary objective study establish safety use moderate escalation radiotherapy dose advanced/poor prognosis OPC LH cancer receive curative radiotherapy . The study also explore efficacy ( improvement complete response rate 2 year ) dose escalation intermediate high risk OPC LH cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Versus Standard Laryngopharyngeal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients locally advanced Laryngeal , Hypopharyngeal ( LH ) oropharyngeal ( OPC ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma 5 year survival range 25-45 % . 60 % LH cancer occur develop world incidence India range 1.8-8.8 per 1,00,000 population . Local control outcomes OPC patient stage III IV OPC modest report loco-regional control rate 50-60 % 5 year . For patient locally advanced LH 60-70 % 2 year survival see loco-regional control rate 70 % report . Majority locally advance OPC LH cancer treat combination chemotherapy radiotherapy ( CRT ) organ function preserve approach . Identifying area tumour involvement OPC LH could challenge CECT scan , require metabolic image PET-CT precise definition radiation target . Improvements radiation treatment delivery technique enable clinician explore possibility improve tumour control probability ( TCP ) reduce normal tissue complication probability . This allow u explore role escalate dose group patient assess safety efficacy regime . Tumours treat standard dose arm receive radiotherapy @ 220 cGy per fraction 30 fraction whilst escalate dose arm receive @ 245 cGy per fraction 30 fraction use IMRT technique . Patients arm receive weekly platinum base chemotherapy concurrent radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
