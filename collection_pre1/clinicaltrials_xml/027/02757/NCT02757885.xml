	<detailed_description>The purpose study learn possible safe treat person severe sickle cell disease ( SCD ) bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) half-matched related donor . Preparation transplant include chemotherapy drug hydroxyurea , fludarabine , thiotepa , anti-thymocyte globulin , cyclophosphamide . It also include radiation . Investigators also seek understand side effect BMT adolescent young adult SCD measure often serious side effect occur include expect unexpected . After transplant , investigator measure health body organ ordinarily would damage SCD addition test lung , brain , kidney .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Disease severity : Participants SCD 1 follow ( iv ) . Clinically significant neurologic event ( stroke ) neurological deficit last &gt; 24 hour ; History two episode acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) 2year period precede enrollment despite institution supportive care measure ( i.e . asthma therapy and/or hydroxyurea ) ; History three severe pain crisis per year 2year period precede enrollment despite institution supportive care measure ( i.e . pain management plan and/or treatment hydroxyurea ) ; Administration regular red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion therapy , define receive 8 transfusion per year ≥ 1 year prevent vasoocclusive clinical complication ( i.e . pain , stroke , ACS ) . Patients chronic transfusion discontinue transfusion allosensitization eligible . An echocardiographic finding tricuspid valve regurgitant jet ( TRJ ) velocity ≥ 2.7 m/sec . Patients age 18 year must cardiac catheterization proven pulmonary arterial hypertension qualify eligibility criterion . 2 . Age : Patients must 15 40 year age inclusive OR young 15 year must pubertal 3 . Adequate physical function measure : Karnofsky/Lansky performance score ≥ 60 Cardiac function : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 40 % LV shorten fraction &gt; 26 % cardiac echocardiogram MUGA scan . Pulmonary function : Pulse oximetry baseline O2 saturation ≥ 85 % DLCO &gt; 40 % ( correct hemoglobin ) . Renal function : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal age per local laboratory 24 hour urine creatinine clearance &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 GFR &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 radionuclide GFR . Hepatic function : Serum conjugate ( direct ) bilirubin &lt; 2 x upper limit normal age per local laboratory ALT AST &lt; 5 x upper limit normal per local laboratory . Patients hyperbilirubinemia consequence hyperhemolysis , experience sudden , profound change serum hemoglobin RBC transfusion , exclude . For participant suitable donor meet eligibility criterion willing proceed HCT , receive chronic transfusion therapy ≥ 1 year clinical evidence iron overload serum ferritin MRI , evaluation liver biopsy require . Histological examination liver must document absence cirrhosis , bridge fibrosis , active hepatitis . The absence bridge fibrosis determine use histological grade stag scale 4 . Suitable Donor : To undergo transplantation study , participant must adult first degree relative share least 1 human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) haplotype participant , SCD hemoglobinopathy , good health ; criterion meet , allow serve donor . Relatives sickle cell trait exclude donor . When 1 donor available , donor few HLA allele mismatch choose , unless patient donor antiHLA antibodies medical reason exclude donor . If donor antiHLA antibody detect , next best related match chosen . Umbilical cord blood peripheral blood stem cell donor accept . Availability HLA match sibling 8 8 HLAA , B , C DRB1 match unrelated donor Presence donor specific antibody patient Histological examination liver must document absence cirrhosis , bridge fibrosis active hepatitis . The absence bridge fibrosis determine use histological grade stag scale describe Ishak colleague ( 1995 ) . The presence bridge fibrosis exclusion criterion . Uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection 6 week enrollment Seropositivity HIV Previous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) Participation clinical trial patient receive investigational drug device offlabel use drug device within 3 month enrollment Demonstrated lack compliance prior medical care Unwilling use approve contraception least 6 month transplant A history substance abuse last 5 year interfere care Pregnant breast feed female time consideration HCT Donor Selection Criteria : Preference give related marrow donor 24 ( 8 ) HLA antigen mismatch towards recipient donor specific antibody . Donors sign informed consent disclose marrow donation use patient participate study . The donor must match recipient least 4 8 HLA allele ( HLA A , B , C DRB1 allelelevel DNA methodology ) . The target total nucleated cell count ( TNC ) 3.58.0 x 108/kg recipient weight . Marrow collect without mobilization . Mobilized peripheral blood stem cell ( HPCA ) collection permit . Donors must undergo hemoglobinopathy screen electrophoresis ; donor hemoglobinopathy exclude trait condition acceptable .</criteria>
