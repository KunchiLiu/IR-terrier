	<brief_summary>Bedrest lack mobility inpatient hospital set hastens functional decline elderly patient associate increased risk complication fall , delirium , venous thrombosis , skin breakdown . These adverse health effect drive increase cost patient spend additional time acute ( hospital ) post-acute care setting . Physical activity thus widely recognize important factor improve outcome hospitalized patient ; however , numerous challenge implementation exist . Specifically , although find small increase physical activity increase number step 600 daily inpatient , length stay reduce nearly 2 day , usual care many hospital , include Cleveland Clinic , include exercise , physicians regularly order physical activity hospitalize patient . Even activity recommend order , compliance execution order spotty and/or negligible . It therefore clear current system provision ambulation ineffective . The investigator hypothesize grade protocol ambulation implement dedicated patient care nursing assistant ( PCNA ) multiple time daily provide significant benefit patient without labor cost requirement full-time nursing physical therapy expertise . The objective study assess feasibility effectiveness dedicate ambulator-assisted physical activity elderly inpatient . The primary hypothesis ambulator-assisted intervention hospitalize elderly inpatient prove feasible may result improved hospital outcome , include less need inpatient rehabilitation shorter length stay hospital . This study provide pilot data large randomized trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dedicated Ambulator-assisted Physical Activity Improve Hospital Outcome Measures Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Aim 1 : To determine feasibility implement ambulator-assisted exercise intervention elderly patient inpatient medicine service . The investigator work closely physical therapy team develop graded ambulation protocol implement multiple time daily per enrol patient PCNA . Investigators work closely medicine unit recruit eligible patient assess protocol implementation include recruitment , patient cooperation , schedule . Aim 2 : To determine effect ambulator-assisted exercise intervention discharge disposition , length stay cost . The investigator measure proportion patient intervention usual care group discharge home vs. acute rehabilitation facility . Length stay cost obtain hospital billing record . Research Strategy The investigator propose development feasible program assist improve physical capacity elderly inpatient . Such improvement may translate cost saving form decrease length stay , improve discharge disposition , few hospital-related complication , establish purpose study . The investigator propose feasible cost-effective implementation program utilize patient care nursing assistant ( PCNA ) dedicate carry grade ambulation protocol eligible patient multiple time daily . A simple standardized protocol ambulation reduce need expertise dedicate physical therapist . Additionally , utilize exist mechanism assess baseline functional capacity , 6-Clicks score , eliminate time personnel requirement evaluation patient eligibility . This score validate mechanism ass patient mobility limitation acute care set currently use patient see physical therapy inpatient medicine service . This pilot study enable investigator identify patient would tolerate intervention degree participation would meaningful improve outcome measure . The study begin enrol patient 6-Clicks score 16-20 , patient experience great benefit ambulation protocol . At present , patient receive PT intervention ambulation nurse occur sporadically time allow . Additionally , pilot help bring clarity direct impact aggressive mobilization medical inpatient important outcome directly tie healthcare cost . Results work inform feasibility power calculation large randomize trial . Results trial could directly impact approach medical inpatient term prioritize resourcing mobilization strategy . Preliminary finding pilot study demonstrate feasibility dedicate ambulator-assisted physical activity protocol potential impact hospital outcome provide justification external funding large randomized clinical trial . Lessons learn pilot study allow u optimize ambulation protocol target population large study . Such study would investigate effect ambulator-assisted physical activity protocol patient mobility associate health care cost . This work could shift current paradigm aggressive mobilization reserve post-acute care setting could serve model improve value care provide elderly patient acute care facility .</detailed_description>
