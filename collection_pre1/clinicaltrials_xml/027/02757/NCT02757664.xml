	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluate Adjuvant Effect Shock Wave Therapy Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : The insertional tendinopathy occur Achilles attachment tuberosity calcaneus bone 2 cm proximal tuberosity . It generally associate traction enthesophyte ( upper spur ) , Haglund deformity ( pump bump ) pre retro achilles bursitis . Nowadays , consider cause multi-factorial , comprehend mechanical , vascular , neural genetic factor . Historically , disease´s initial treatment base motor physiotherapy , via eccentric strengthen tendon . If , one hand , result non-insertional tendinopathy encouraging , 82 % duly successful , insertional tendinopathy , hand , produce rate improvement range 32 67 % patient , accord present study . The failure traditional treatment normally lead patient surgery frequently associate complication , wound necrosis tendon rupture . More recently , therapy shock wave use treatment pseudo-arthrosis several type tendinopathy . Several study show mentioned effect shock wave therapy may theoretically stimulate neovascularization collagen production , besides important healing process , also permit several clinical usage , skin heal treatment , pseudo-arthrosis several tendinopathies , include Achilles insertional tendinopathy . The shock wave therapy progressively study . Recent work present good result technique however ; evidence still insufficient represent consensus regard indication treatment . The objective present study compare effectiveness eccentric strengthen protocol without shockwave therapy consider VISA-A . Hypothesis : The shock wave therapy ally eccentric strengthen protocol present well result eccentric strengthen associate placebo . Material Method Design Double blind randomized clinical trial , use placebo , parallel group Setting The study conduct Hospital São Paulo - University Hospital UNIFESP ( HSP-UNIFESP ) , Orthopedics Traumatology Department ( DOT ) CPRT - Centre Tissue Research Regeneration ( DOT/EPM-UNIFESP ) ; link FINEP project regard Shock Waves . Inclusion Criteria : Older 18 young 65 year age , gender ; Pain symptom calcaneus tendon insertion region last three month ; Clinical diagnosis : presence pain palpation tendinous insertion region calcaneus bone ( 2cm close region ) occurrence increase region´s volume ; Indication tendinopathy Ultra Sound do previous health center certify doctor ; Lateral X-ray view calcaneus , show associate condition ( Haglund , enthesophyte intra-substantial calcification ) . Exclusion Criteria : Previous surgery involve affected foot ankle ; History document evidence autoimmune peripheral vascular disease ; History document evidence peripheral neuropathy ( nervous compression syndrome , tarsal tunnel syndrome ) .History document evidence systemic inflammatory disease ( rheumatoid arthritis , spondylitis , Reiter Syndrome , etc . ) ; Non-Insertional mixed tendinopathy ( insertional non-insertional ) ; Previous infiltration affect tendon six month precede initial assessment ; Beginning present pain , due trauma ; Gross congenital deformity overweighting triceps sural muscle , main aetiology present disease ; Pregnancy ; Any condition represent contraindication propose therapy ; Any physical social limitation make protocol continuation unviable ; Impossibility incapacity sign Free Informed Consent Form ; History document evidence concern blood coagulation disorder ( treatment anti-coagulant , exclude aspirin ) ; Use heart pacemaker ; Sampling : calculation considers standard deviation 16.2 ; clinical difference detect corresponds 3,3 sample error 5 % . It calculate consider 93 patient divide two group randomize way . The sample amount define accord methodology indicate Attachment I , , base Central Limit Theorem Laws Large Numbers , sample size guarantee reliability statistic . Randomization : The randomization sequence generate via compute software ( http : //www.randomizer.org/form.htm ) , produce list 1 - x , number related sole treatment method . Investigators perform randomization interchanged block , number patient group . Allocation : The patient fill initial questionnaire order select ( Attachment 1 ) . After , assistant doctor physical diagnostic examination patient . Then , US XRay procedure take place , order complete diagnostic assessment . The patient include protocol duly randomize diagnostic confirmation do via anamnesis physical examination , also completion supplementary test , signature Informed Consent Form , fulfilment inclusion criterion non-adequacy exclusion criterion . The following data collect epidemiological : analysis lesion intervention : Body mass index , Sex , Age , Sports practice ( Yes/No ) , Presence Haglung Deformity ( Y/N ) , Presence Enthesophyte ( Y/N ) . Each non-transparent seal envelope , number 1 93 , contain either paper word `` physiotherapy '' word `` physiotherapy shock wave '' . Each treatment method number envelope . The patient initially assess individually , randomize allocated way . The intervention procedure , position preparation , differ regard existence support applicator head shock wave apparatus group patient without shock wave . Blinding : Neither patient evaluator doctor access protocol test apply patient . The patient include study diagnostic confirmation do medical history physical examination , also completion subsidiary test ( US ) , signature Informed Consent Form , fulfilment inclusion criterion non-adequacy exclusion criterion . Intervention : Utilization shock wave : Appliance US gel region receive shock wave ; Appliance radial shock wave BLT600 equipment ( BTL Medical Technologies - Canada ) , intensity 2000 3000 pulse , 7 10Hz frequency , 1,5 2,5Bar intensity per application ; Appliance first day treatment ( D0 ) describe , repeat second week first intervention ( 2nd week ) four week first intervention ( 4th week ) . Group without Shock wave : Appliance US gel region receive shock wave ; Placing apparatus´ therapeutic head support block shock wave propagation directly appliance field ; Appliance radial shock wave BLT600 equipment ( BTL Medical Technologies - Canada ) , intensity 2000 3000 pulse , 7 10Hz frequency , 1,5 2,5Bar intensity per application ; Appliance first day treatment ( D0 ) describe , repeat second week first intervention ( 2nd week ) four week first intervention ( 4th week ) . Eccentric Exercises The group submit Alfredson eccentric strengthen protocol 12 week , start day first appliance . The exercise show patient assistant doctor , booklet ( Attachment 2 ) hand , detailed explanation concern protocol follow . Secondary Conclusion : EVA ( Visual Analogue Scale ) ; AOFAS ; SF-12 ; Algometry ( pain threshold VAS 3kg ) Follow : The patient must return ambulatory clinical assessment 2 week , 4 week , 6 week , 8 week , 3 month 6 month begin protocol . Assessment Scores : The questionnaire VISA-A , EVA , AOFAS SF-12 apply first consultation . The patient also assess questionnaire interval 1 , 3 6 month protocol . Statistical Analysis : After collect information define result , descriptive analysis quantitative variable ( interval 95 % reliability average/mean ) . The qualitative variable require Comparison Two Proportions via relative frequency analysis . The Pearson Correlation use check relation quantitative variable , Chi-Square test utilized relation qualitative variable . The ANOVA test use compare two technique base average .</detailed_description>
