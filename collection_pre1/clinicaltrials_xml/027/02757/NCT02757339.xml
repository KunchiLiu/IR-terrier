	<brief_title>Evaluating Neurobiological Basis Traumatic Dissociation Women With Histories Abuse Neglect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dissociative symptom commonly associate exposure traumatic stress . Preliminary evidence functional magnetic resonance imaging-based analysis ( fMRI ) neural activation dissociative symptom provocation patient PTSD DID implicate certain key structure involve generation dissociative symptom . Given presumed region-to-region neural interplay implicit within model , investigator believe use intrinsic functional connectivity MRI ( fcMRI ) represent valuable next line investigation neurobiology traumatic dissociation . The investigator also believe genetic approach hold promise another converge line inquiry understand traumatic dissociation . To evaluate neurobiological basis traumatic dissociation , study recruit patient PTSD DID , recruit match control identify neurobiological correlate traumatic dissociation.The study compare phenomenology traumatic dissociation patient different PTSD subtypes DID use standardized measure look neurological genetic correlate . This study also include follow visit include neuroimaging genetic assessment .</detailed_description>
