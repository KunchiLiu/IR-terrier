	<brief_summary>This randomize , multi-center , active-controlled , repeated measure design study male female patient 60 year age old persistent asthma COPD . Study conduct 4 Italian University/Hospital Centers : Ferrara , Parma , Cassano delle Murge ( Ba ) , Tradate . The primary efficacy parameter study inhaler device usability ( express total number repeat attempt require achieve optimal use ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Usability Inhaler Devices Adults With Asthma COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) common condition increase prevalence worldwide . Inhaled therapy condition number advantage systemic therapy , include reduced side effect quicker onset action . However , poor asthma control common , despite available effective treatment .This partially relate low adherence difficulty use inhaler device . Among patient chronic respiratory disorder , 18 % discontinue prescribed inhaler treatment trouble device ( Santus 2012 ) . Some device easy handle , require breathing ability , reduce effectiveness real life , especially elderly.Since mistake inhaler technique common affect drug delivery efficacy , correct inhaler technique training fundamental . A single site study 2012 ( Press 2012 ) find patient give verbal write instruction follow demonstration inhaler use well inhaler technique patient give verbal write instruction . The author conclude large multi-centred study need evaluate hospital-based-education . Proposals improve inhaler use base three key point : - choice best device pay attention patient need ability ( personalized therapy ) - complete explanation correct use ( patient training ) - regular re-check evaluate maintenance correct technique ( monitor ) The study consist two phase : - A cross phase : 3 period 1 week . During train visit begin week period , patient instruct correct use one 3 device . Correct use maintenance correct use 1 week assess . - A longitudinal phase : patient treat last inhaler device use cross phase 8 additional week . The maximum time screen end study visit is12 week , follow take place 30 day final visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Informed consent . Written inform consent/assent sign dated patient conduct study related procedure . Age . Male female patient 60 year old Screening Visit ( SV ) Asthma COPD diagnosis . Previous new Asthma/COPD diagnosis accordance Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) Global initiative chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) . Severity respiratory disease : Persistent asthma , prebronchodilator FEV1 4085 % predict age , height , gender race , minimum 3 month duration . COPD , prebronchodilator FEV1 4085 % predict age , height , gender race , minimum 3 month . Stable state . Patients without exacerbation without change previous treatment least 4 week prior visit 1 defined clinical history . Comorbidities . No concomitant severe comorbidities could interfere study conduct , influence interpretation study observations/results , put patient increase risk study observations/results , put patient increase risk study . Current Therapy : Patients need combination ICS/LABA already treatment PDI ( Turbohaler ) Diskus . ShortActing beta2Agonists : All patient must able replace current shortacting beta2agonists albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol visit 1 use need duration study . Patients must able withhold inhale shortacting betapathomimetic bronchodilator least 6 hour prior study visit . Capable understanding requirement , risk , benefit study participation , , judge investigator , capable give informed consent/assent compliant study requirement ( visit , recordkeeping , etc. ) . Asthma severity . History lifethreatening asthma define protocol asthma episode require intubation and/or associate hypercapnia , respiratory arrest hypoxic seizure . COPD severity . COPD prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 30 % and/or FEV1 3050 % require long term oxygen therapy . Exacerbations . Any asthma/COPD exacerbation within one month visit 1 . A patient must hospitalisation asthma/COPD within 6 month prior visit 1 . Respiratory infection . Culturedocumented suspected bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus , middle ear resolve within 2 week prior visit 1 . Comorbidities . Historical current evidence clinically significant comorbidity include , limited : cardiovascular ( e.g . congestive heart failure , know aortic aneurysm , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia coronary heart disease ) , hepatic , renal , hematological ( e.g . immunologic compromise ) , neuropsychological , endocrine ( e.g . uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled thyroid disorder , Addison 's disease , Cushing 's syndrome ) , gastrointestinal ( e.g . poorlycontrolled peptic ulcer , gastroesophageal reflux disease ) , pulmonary ( e.g . bronchiectasis need treatment , cystic fibrosis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , lung cancer ) history positive test HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Significant define disease , opinion investigator , would put safety patient risk participation , could affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . History adverse reaction . History adverse reaction include immediate delay hypersensitivity beta2agonist , sympathomimetic drug , intranasal , inhale , systemic corticosteroid therapy . Known suspected sensitivity constituent inhaler use study ( e.g . lactose dry powder inhaler ) . Use immunosuppressive medication . Use immunosuppressive medication within 12 week prior visit 1 study , include use systemic corticosteroid . Immunotherapy stable dose least 90 day prior visit 1 throughout study treatment allergy permit . Smoking . Current smoker exclude . A patient may use tobacco product within past one year ( e.g. , cigarette , cigar , chew tobacco , pipe tobacco ) . Concomitant participation research study . Participation another research study investigational drug study within 30 day ( start final followup visit ) precede visit 1 plan participation another investigational drug study time study .</criteria>
