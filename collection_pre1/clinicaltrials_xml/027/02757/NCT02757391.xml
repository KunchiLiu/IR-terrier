	<detailed_description>Leukapheresis Tissue Collection : If eligible agree , consent enrolled separate protocol , PA14-0138 , leukapheresis procedure perform . Leukapheresis special type blood draw procedure separate red blood cell , white blood cell , part blood . The consent form protocol explain leukapheresis procedure perform risk . The white blood cell collect leukapheresis use study . You need tumor tissue available study . If enough tumor tissue available , consent enrolled separate protocol , PA15-0176 tumor tissue collection . The consent form PA15-0176 explain tissue collect risk . After tissue blood cell collect , T cell product make . Standard Care Chemotherapy : You must receive least 1 type chemotherapy enrol study T cell dose . There limit number type chemotherapy may receive . Your study doctor decide enter treatment part study . In general exhausted standard chemotherapy option receive T cell product . Within 28 day last dose chemotherapy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test genetic mutation immune system test . The routine blood draw include pregnancy test become pregnant . - You CT scan check status disease . - A date choose T cell infusion . Cyclophosphamide Administration : Two ( 2 ) day CD8+T cell infusion , receive cyclophosphamide vein 30 minute . Cyclophosphamide give low dose weaken body 's natural defense T-cell transplant , transplant T-cells chance grow multiply . CD8+T Cell Infusion : You admit hospital day CD8+T cell infusion ( Day 0 ) . The infusion take 2 hour . After T cell infusion , monitor overnight side effect . On Day 0 : - You physical exam . - 6 tablespoon blood drawn routine , genetic , immune system test . Aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) Administration : Starting within 6 hour cell infusion 2 time day 14 day , aldesleukin injection skin around abdomen . Aldesleukin give help survival infuse CD8+T cell . You teach give injection , give needle , syrinx supply finish 14-day course home . Pembrolizumab Administration : Pembrolizumab give 24 hour T cell infusion vein 30 60 minute . Pembrolizumab take away natural immune system process would stop CD8+T cell . You additional infusion 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 week T cell infusion . Study Visits : On Day +3 , Day 1 Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 24 : - You physical exam ( except week 1 2 ) . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine genetic mutation immune system test . During Weeks 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , CT scan check status disease . Length Study : After T cell infusion , may receive pembrolizumab 6 total dos . You longer able study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study 6 month T cell infusion . Follow-Up : You call 2 time study staff 6 month study ask side effect may . Each call last 10 minute . If leave study side effect , call study staff side effect go away become stable . This investigational study . The CD8+T cell infusion FDA-approved commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain T cell therapy design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Men must willing able use acceptable method birth control , least 3 month completion study , sexual partner WOCBP . 6 . Willing able give inform consent . 7 . Adequate vein access : consider PICC central line . 8 . Patients must adequate tissue ( fresh frozen ) available plan removal adequate tissue analysis . At least 250mg tumor need peptide elution . There specific time limit long tissue remain frozen prior use . The tissue collect analyzed Lab protocol PA150176 . 9 . Patients line ( include zero ) prior therapy sign consent prior tissue harvest . 10 . Toxicity related prior therapy must either return &lt; /= grade 1 , baseline , deem irreversible . 11 . ELIGIBILITY FOR TREATMENT : ECOG/Zubrod performance status 0 2 . 12 . Bidimensionally measurable disease radiographic imaging ( CT scan ) represent least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 . 13 . At least 4 Weeks must elapse since last chemotherapy , radiotherapy major surgery . 14 . Toxicity related prior therapy must either return less equal grade 1 , baseline , deem irreversible . 15 . Subjects must receive least one line chemotherapy prior receive adoptive T cell therapy exhaust standard care systemic therapy option . The decision implement T cell therapy discretion treat physician . The timing total exposure chemotherapy depend tumor type question ( systemic option breast cancer ; few gastric cancer , example ) . Due heterogeneity tumor treat protocol , discretion treat physician term time immunotherapy critical . 1 . EXCLUSION FOR ENROLLMENT : Any malignancy patient diseasefree less 5 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ cervix . 2 .
