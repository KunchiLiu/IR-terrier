	<detailed_description>The overarch hypothesis baseline , pre- post-surgery combination 'omics ' signature response food nutrient explain weight loss response obese subject pre-operative low calorie ( VLC ) diet bariatric surgery . In order address general hypothesis follow specific aim address : Specific Aim 1 : To test hypothesis combination 'omics ' parameter response define meal discriminate morbidly obese subject normal weight subject . Specific Aim 2 : To test hypothesis variation % weight loss VLC diet prior bariatric surgery relate baseline genomic marker , gene expression profile , proteomic metabolomic signature well baseline metabolic substrate fluxomics response define meal . Specific Aim 2 : To test hypothesis variation % weight loss 3 month bariatric surgery relate baseline genomic marker , gene expression profile , proteomic metabolomic signature well baseline metabolic substrate fluxomics response define meal . Specific Aim 3 : To test whether `` omics '' characteristic post-surgery track variability weight loss 3 month . The benefit experiment knowledge gain understanding variation % weight loss medically require VLC diet prior bariatric surgery , bariatric surgery , relation baseline genomic marker , gene expression profile , proteomic metabolomic signature well baseline metabolic substrate fluxomics response define meal obese healthy adult .</detailed_description>
