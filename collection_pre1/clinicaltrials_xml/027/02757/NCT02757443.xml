	<brief_summary>There evidence role phosphotransfer system energy metabolism heart , alter energetics play important role mechanism heart failure . Phosphocreatine play important part energy heart system . The investigator perform systematic review meta-analysis randomize control trial ( RCTs ) match study compare phosphocreatine placebo standard treatment patient coronary artery disease chronic heart failure undergo cardiac surgery . Patients receive phosphocreatine low all-cause mortality well improve cardiac outcome compare control group , however , quality include study low . Thus , investigator plan conduct exploratory high quality RCT investigate whether provide phosphocreatine compare placebo improve myocardial protection high-risk patient schedule cardiac surgery determine best research endpoint future trial .</brief_summary>
