	<brief_summary>This multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study design evaluate efficacy safety Botulinus Toxin Type A Injection ( HengLi® ) patient overactive bladder ( OAB ) . Approximately 216 subject enrol . Subjects randomize 2:1 receive intradetrusor injection Botulinus Toxin Type A Injection ( HengLi® ) 100 U placebo . The study contain two part : core double-blinded phase extension phase . In core double-blinded phase , eligible subject must attend three study visit posttreatment 12 week . During extension phase , subject must also attend three study visit ( 12 week ) . The primary efficacy variable change baseline daily average frequency micturition week 6 first treatment.A 3-day paper bladder diary use study visit ( screen period , second week , sixth week , twelfth week , fourteenth week , eighteenth week twenty fourth week ) collect OAB symptom ( episodes urgency , incontinence , micturition nocturia ) volume per voidSafety parameter also measure , include adverse event , vital sign ( pulse blood pressure ) clinical laboratory test ( haematology , serum chemistry urinanalysis ) .</brief_summary>
