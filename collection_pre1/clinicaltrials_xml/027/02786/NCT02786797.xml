	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate MBSR ( BC ) , intensive meditation-based stress reduction intervention , order determine efficacy improve cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivor . The study employ three group randomize design ( 1 ) evaluate extent MBSR ( BC ) compare Breast Cancer-Education Support ( BCES ) program Usual Care ( UC ) improve cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivor treatment ; ( 2 ) determine improvement cognitive function achieve MBSR ( BC ) mediate increased mindfulness decrease rumination stress ; ( 3 ) evaluate genetic variant moderator MBSR ( BC ) improvements CI ; ( 4 ) determine impact MBSR ( BC ) healthcare utilization cost , addition deliver sub-group Spanish . If show efficacious , possibility exists utilize intervention type cancer well non-cancer health-related disorder order minimize morbidity experienced population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy MBSR Treatment Cognitive Impairment Among Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due improve detection treatment , survival rate among breast cancer survivor increase . However , breast cancer survivor may experience cognitive impairment ( CI ) follow treatment , report breast cancer survivor 10 year chemotherapy ( CT ) . There limited evidence whether stress-reducing intervention improve CI breast cancer survivor . The primary goal application establish Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Breast Cancer ( MBSR ( BC ) ) program effective treatment CI breast cancer survivor . Specifically study aim ( 1 ) evaluate extent MBSR ( BC ) compare Breast Cancer-Education Support ( BCES ) program Usual Care ( UC ) improve cognitive functioning among breast cancer survivor treatment ; ( 2 ) determine improvement cognitive function achieve MBSR ( BC ) mediate increased mindfulness decrease rumination stress ; ( 3 ) evaluate genetic variant moderator MBSR ( BC ) improvements CI ; ( 4 ) determine impact MBSR ( BC ) healthcare utilization cost . To achieve aim , research team conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) among 330 breast cancer survivor Stage I-III BC receive adjuvant CT CT radiation . Within RCT , MBSR ( BC ) deliver subpopulation Spanish speaking breast cancer survivor . Participants randomly assign 1:1:1 ratio ( 1 ) 6-week MBSR ( BC ) program ; ( 2 ) 6-week BCES program ; ( 3 ) UC . The BCES program match MBSR ( BC ) program time attention parallel group support component MBSR ( BC ) . Assessments take place baseline , 6 weeks,12 week 6 month include clinical history demographic information , objective neuropsychological assessment , subjective cognitive symptom measurement , cost utilization survey blood sample collection genetic analysis . This study highly innovative first randomize trial : 1 ) evaluate efficacy MBSR ( BC ) among breast cancer survivor objective neuropsychological subjective improvement cognitive functioning ; 2 ) evaluate genetic profile moderator MBSR ( BC ) improve CI ; 3 ) offer MBSR trial Spanish addition English purpose improve cognition ; 4 ) determine effect MBSR ( BC ) CT-induced CI among breast cancer survivor related health service utilization cost . MBSR ( BC ) provide training promote stress reduction self-regulation attention awareness stressful event . The preliminary result show MBSR ( BC ) improve subjective cognitive functioning . If MBSR ( BC ) find effective , provide evidence viable non-pharmacological method manage CI breast cancer survivor . Additionally , examination effect hypothesize mediator may yield new insight tailor MBSR ( BC ) and/or develop additional intervention aid breast cancer survivor . The assessment genetic polymorphism explore risk allele associate improvement cognitive functioning may demonstrate specific genetic profile may modify improvement CI receive MBSR ( BC ) . Finally , MBSR ( BC ) show effective , may significantly impact healthcare utilization cost produce necessary evidence clinician , researcher policymakers .</detailed_description>
