Yet , intervention address sleep youth T1D . Working biopsychosocial contextual model sleep , investigator propose tailor sleep-promoting intervention meet need adolescent T1D conduct interview identify barrier facilitator adequate sleep specific population .

The study conduct multidisciplinary team , consist Sarah Jaser , PhD , pediatric psychologist , two co-investigators , Beth Malow , MD , MS , neurologist specialty sleep medicine , Jill Simmons , MD , pediatric endocrinologist . Sleep potentially modifiable risk factor may physiological behavioral impact diabetes outcomes . Given strong association sleep diabetes outcomes preliminary data , recent evidence sleep restriction study indicate impact insufficient sleep insulin sensitivity , behavior , mood , reason believe sleep-promoting intervention potential improve outcomes adolescent T1D indirectly improve adherence directly effect metabolic function . Therefore , propose study offer novel approach improve adherence , quality life , glycemic control adolescent T1D .</brief_summary>
