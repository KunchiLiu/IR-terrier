	<brief_title>Optimal Vitamin D3 Supplementation Strategies Acute Fracture Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D supplement increasingly recommend healthy adult fracture patient without osteoporotic injury . Although relatively new practice pattern , basis adjunct therapy ground high hypovitaminosis D prevalence rate ( 75 % ) among healthy adult fracture patient , strong biologic rationale role vitamin D fracture healing . Briefly , experimental animal study demonstrate concentration vitamin D metabolites high fracture callus compare uninjured contralateral bone , vitamin D supplementation lead decreased time union increase callus vascularity , increase mechanical bone strength compare control . While evidence confirm vitamin D supplementation improve fracture heal clinical study exist , pre-clinical data compel worthy investigation . With modern orthopaedic surgical care , rate complication follow tibia femoral shaft fracture high 15 % . Complications , include delay union , nonunion , infection often require secondary surgical procedure result profound personal societal economic cost . While surgeon continue seek advance surgical technique , become increasingly obvious innovation orthopaedic technique implant unlikely eliminate complication . As result , considerable attention currently focus adjunct biologic therapy , vitamin D. A recent survey 397 orthopaedic surgeon show 26 % routinely prescribe vitamin D supplementation adult fracture patient . Of 93 surgeon indicate routinely prescribe vitamin D supplementation , 29 different dose regimen describe range low daily dose 400 IU loading dose 600,000 IU . This suggest high level clinical uncertainty surround use optimal dose vitamin D supplementation adult fracture patient . If vitamin D supplementation improve fracture heal outcome , large opportunity increase use ; however , widespread adoption occur , research need optimize dose strategy , establish dose safety immobilized fracture heal population , overcome potential medication adherence issue among often marginalize patient suffer trauma . The long-term goal research program conduct large phase III RCT determine dose vitamin D3 supplementation optimally improve acute fracture heal outcome healthy adult patient ( 18-50 year ) . The current propose phase II exploratory trial perform important preliminary work test central hypothesis vitamin D3 dose time administration critical improve fracture heal 3 month . This trial also inform feasibility large phase III RCT .</detailed_description>
