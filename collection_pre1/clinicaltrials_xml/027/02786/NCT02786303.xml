	<brief_summary>The diagnosis follow-up neuroendocrine tumor difficult assess , especially detection metastasis grow different organ liver , lung , bone lymph node . Nowadays , diagnosis make two main image technique thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan scintigraphic method ( Octreoscan sometimes TEP-scan ) . The use whole-body MRI often use detection evaluation tumor metastases ; therefore , could use neuroendocrine tumor . The MRI would allow replace two image technique avoid use irradiation also good detection metastasis . This purpose study evaluate statement assess consistency routine technique MRI finally update recommendation study positive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interest Whole-body MRI Correlated Spreading Sequences Staging Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main metastatic site neuroendocrine tumor liver , bone , lung lymph node . According French recommendation ( `` Thesaurus national de cancérologie digestive `` ) , initial assessment include thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan scintigraphic method ( Octreoscan TEP-scan Octreoscan negative ) . The aim detect metastases tumoral progression offer appropriate treatment , surgery . Due high contrast resolution , absence irradiation , diffusion sequence , MRI use detect tumor progression . The recent literature show good result diffusion sequence T2-weighted sequence , potentially , contrast-enhanced sequence detect liver metastasis . The whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI seem promise stag follow cancer . Only two publication evaluate diagnostic value diffusion sequence detect pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor liver metastasis . Yet , publication assess diagnostic value whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI patient neuroendocrine tumor .</detailed_description>
