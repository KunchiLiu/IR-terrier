	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess feasibility multi-institutional study collect cardiopulmonary exercise test 6 minute walk distance performance test prior cycle chemotherapy ( transplant ) , follow collection patient generate health data ( wearable activity monitor patient report outcome ) subsequent month . In addition demonstrate feasibility , study look generate preliminary data support capacity physical performance test patient-generated health data complement clinician-rated performance status patient receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical fitness , base test physical performance measurement daily activity , serve risk stratification variable clinical outcome patient prior cytotoxic chemotherapy . Many cytotoxic therapy cause premature age frailty sizable portion patient , measure improve physical function may also limit late morbidity mortality certain patient population . Clinician-rated performance status ( cPS ; e.g. , ECOG Karnofsky PS ) addition organ-specific function use prognosticate risk determine treatment strategy , cPS readily identifies individual significant functional compromise . Objective evaluation physical function , aerobic capacity measure daily activity , may great potential improve precision performance status evaluation .</detailed_description>
