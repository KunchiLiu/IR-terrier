	<brief_summary>How environmental pollution contributes poor pregnancy outcome poorly understood . The first trim pregnancy particularly vulnerable time period develop fetus mother 's exposure air pollution may alter way placenta establish function throughout rest pregnancy . This project aim expand develop new MRI technology ass real-time placental structure function pregnancy develop first third trimester early detection , prevention strategy , early treatment placental dysfunction result pollution exposure may develop .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many epidemiological study associate exposure traffic-derived air pollution motor vehicle , air toxin industry environmental toxin pregnant woman measure poor birth outcome include preeclampsia ( PE ) , preterm birth ( PTB ) intra-uterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) . Preeclampsia , preterm labor IUGR , collectively know ischemic placental disease , strongly correlate infant morbidity host adult diseases range coronary artery disease cancer . Although widely believe pathophysiological mechanism lead complication ischemic placental disease placental insufficiency similar biological origin , start early defective placental implantation , date predictive study prospectively examine placental structure and/or function . This may relate exist technology , routinely employed clinical decision-making , ultrasonography certain biomarkers , lack precision first trimester , adequate sensitivity specificity second third trimester . Thus , assessment prediction normalcy versus aberrancy placental function lacking . Therefore , overarch objective proposal develop evaluate suit cutting-edge multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mp-MRI ) technology ( primary predictor ) , translate novel placental imaging modality assess impact environmental pollution exposure prediction composite placental aberrancy/insufficiency relate outcome ( PE , PTB IUGR ) ( primary outcome ) . Our central hypothesis chronic exposure high rate environmental pollution , independent socio-economic status ( SES ) , increase risk placental insufficiency due early gestational development adverse placental structure/function detect mp-MRI technological advance . To test hypothesis , interdisciplinary research team UCLA first develop non-contrast freebreathing placental mp-MRI , consist multi-delay pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling ( pCASL ) perfusion high-resolution multi-contrast structural MRI , provide reproducible measure placental perfusion tissue microstructure ( AIM 1 ) . The novel mp-MRI technique compare uterine artery Doppler ultrasound pregnancy validate ultimately gold standard histological pathology vascularity post-parturient placenta ( AIM 2 ) . Lastly , investigator perform in-depth analysis recruit subject exposure environmental pollution correlate rate exposure extensively collect pregnancy outcome , towards build predictive model ( AIM 3 ) . Our specific aim : AIM 1 : Develop non-contrast free-breathing placental mp-MRI technique non-invasively characterize vivo placental perfusion microstructure trimester . A . Develop free-breathing multi-delay pCASL sequence use background-suppressed localized-volume 3D GRASE image quantitative measurement placental perfusion within 5-10 min scan ( 1.5x1.5x2 mm3 resolution ) . B . Develop free-breathing high-resolution golden-angle 3D stack-of-radial sequence self-navigation retrospective motion compensation use compressed sense mapping placental microstructure within 5-10 min scan ( 1x1x1 mm3 isotropic resolution ) . AIM 2 : Evaluate placental mp-MRI longitudinal comparison uterine artery Doppler ultrasound gestation predictive marker placental insufficiency . A . Conduct 3-year prospective cohort study pregnant woman , perform newly develop mp-MRI ( AIM1 ) 1st 2nd trimester parallel ultrasound measurement uterine artery Doppler , assess mp-MRI prediction capability versus ultrasound . B . Collect detailed pregnancy outcome data prospective cohort , include diagnosis , neonatal outcome , placenta pathological histological analysis ascertain risk factor placental insufficiency response environmental exposure ( AIM 3 ) . AIM 3 : Perform in-depth analysis recruit subject determine association environmental pollution exposure placental mp-MRI measurement concomitant pregnancy outcome . A . Perform in-depth analysis measure model environmental pollution exposure recruit subject assess association mp-MRI measure placental structure perfusion throughout gestation , take account multiple confounding factor maternal age delivery , race/ethnicity , SES . B. Correlate mp-MRI measure placental structure perfusion throughout gestation pregnancy outcomes , post-parturient assessment placental weight , pathology , neonatal outcome . These study establish impact environmental pollution placental structure function , related pregnancy outcome , obstetric neonatal practice embrace surveillance tactic base residential location pregnant woman offspring . In addition , propose research establish potential early recognition placental insufficiency , thereby stag future strategy preventive interventional therapy target reversal encounter detrimental consequence .</detailed_description>
