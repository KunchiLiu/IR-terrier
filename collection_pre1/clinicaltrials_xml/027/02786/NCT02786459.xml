	<brief_summary>An exploratory , feasibility proof-of-concept study evaluate capability rectal probe scintigraphy device ( ProxiScanTM ) detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent ( ProstaScintÂ® ; surrogate marker prostate cancer ) patient undergone radical prostatectomy disease , patient multiple negative prostate biopsy patient know primary prostate cancer . Developed Hybridyne Imaging Technologies , Inc. ProxiScanTM small cadmium zinc telluride ( CST ) -based compact gamma camera . It size trans-rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) , currently use prostate biopsy guidance . Men multiple positive biopsy consider control . Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology result correlate ProxiScanTM , TRUS , MRI SPECT/CT . The investigator hypothesize safe feasible utilize rectal probe scintigraphy ( ProxiScanTM ) detect PSMA specific ProstaScintÂ® , thus identify localize tumour site within prostate surround area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Group 1 : Rising PSA ( biochemical failure ) follow radical prostatectomy . Group 2 : Rising PSA ( &gt; 10ng/ml ) and/or abnormal digital rectal exam suspicious prostate cancer . Previously negative prostate biopsy . Group 3 : Scheduled biopsy know PCa ( patient AS ) . At least 1 previously positive prostate biopsy adenocarcinoma prostate . Patients must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : Sufficient time period complete image protocol 7 9 day safety followup assessment without therapeutic intervention . Patient judge Investigator initiative mean provide write consent compliant protocol able commits make require study visit . Ambulatory ECOG performance status 0 1 ( see appendix section ) . Patient 35 75 year age . The presence follow exclude patient study enrollment : Patient physician plan definitive concomitant chemotherapy , therapeutic radiation treatment , biologic treatment and/or local ablative treatment cancer within interval study participation . Patients pacemaker , neurostimulators , foreign metal body exclude unable undergo MRI SPECTCT . Prior history murine antibody infusion , patient hypersensitive product murine origin indium111 chloride . Prior therapeutic pelvic irradiation . Recent prostate biopsy , within 1 month study enrollment . Patient contraindication TRUSguided prostate biopsy ( continuous need anticoagulation , rectum , etc . ) Clinical evidence prostatitis , benign prostate gland abnormality , would explain elevated PSA and/or ( digital rectal exam ) DRE finding . Active malignancy therapy malignancy within 6 month , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patient receive radiopharmaceutical within 5 physical halflives time study image . Severe psychiatric medical illness may interfere compliance study protocol followup deem investigator .</criteria>
