	<brief_summary>Early ambulation knee replacement surgery make possible large part provide safe effective pain control . Peripheral nerve block increasingly use postoperative analgesia since provide excellent pain relief minimize need opioid analgesic . Ultrasound guide adductor canal block ( ACB ) first report 2009 anesthesiologist University Utah . This block unique spare motor function low extremity . Since 2009 , number publication describe successful use ACB pain management total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction , procedures knee . As component multi-modal analgesia , ACB provide effective postoperative pain control facilitate early hospital discharge . Although widely utilize , ACB block technically difficult perform since require injection immediate proximity femoral artery vein . In patient large thigh circumference , ultrasound challenge since femoral vessel deeply difficult visualize . This present possibility vessel trauma and/or intravascular injection local anesthetic . The investigator implement new technique perform ACB . This block perform use 20G fenestrated needle . The needle FDA approve peripheral nerve block . It occlude tip 8 side port alternate side distal 2cm . Injection fenestrated needle produce effective distribution local anesthetic nerve adductor canal without immediate proximity femoral artery vein . The ultrasound landmark use perform ACB fenestrated needle readily visible even patient large thigh circumference . In summary , early experience US guide ACB block perform fenestrated block needle suggest technically easy potentially safer perform block perform conventional needle . This study perform prospectively order ensure accurate data compare two needle . A retrospective review block perform use conventional needle would provide accurate data respect number attempt , time require perform block result sensory change perform nerve block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Comparison Adductor Canal Block Performed With Multiport Versus Single Bevel Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new fenestrated ( multiple side-ports ) needle recently clear FDA perform peripheral nerve block . Experience needle suggests make ACB technically easy safer perform.This due large part eliminate need position needle close proximity large blood vessel thigh . The objective study would prospectively compare nerve block perform postoperative analgesia perform use conventional ( single bevel ) needle perform use fenestrated needle . Specifically , investigator would compare metric ; time perform block , number attempt , unintentional blood vessel puncture , successful injection rate . Successful injection rate would quantify compare distribution sensory loss injection . Those injection result loss sensation skin surface innervated nerve adductor canal would judge `` successful '' . An absence sensory change surface would judge `` unsuccessful '' . Procedures : All patient randomize receive treatment one two nerve block needle . Neither investigator patient blind . Randomization base solely result computer generate random sequence . All patient participate study receive anesthetic , surgery , postoperative care , pain management provide currently patient ( include enrol study protocol ) knee replacement University Utah . This investigation design compare efficacy two needle design currently use FDA approve peripheral nerve block . Patients consent participate study randomize receive ACB perform either single bevel ( conventional ) fenestrated needle . The ACB place preoperative hold area approximately 30 minute transport operating room . During performance nerve block , time complete nerve block , number attempt use complete nerve block , incidence blood vessel puncture and/or blood aspiration record case . All patient also assess sensory change low extremity metric block efficacy . In operating room , patient anesthetize use spinal block receive intravenous sedation discretion attend anesthesiologist . During postoperative period , quality duration analgesia primary metric use compare two study needle . Specifically , numerical pain score report patient opioid consumption compare group . All patient possible `` fail nerve block '' offer repeat `` rescue '' nerve block surgery . A failed block would define absence sensory change extremity associate poor pain control report patient . Additional metric comparison would time ambulation surgery time hospital discharge . Statistical Methods , Data Analysis Interpretation The study prospective randomize two group patient nerve block part pain management protocol total knee replacement .</detailed_description>
