	<brief_title>Plasmodium Immunotherapy Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct two stage . Stage 1 preliminary study , 20 patient stage III/IV NSCLC enrol receive vaccination optimal concentration amount blood-stage P. vivax observe infection time , rate cycle ; principal clinical symptom fever anemia ; heart , liver kidney function ; change spleen morphology function , dynamic change function peripheral immune cell . Moreover , change tumor-related parameter observe . Stage 2 primary study , 60 patient enrol receive vaccination blood stage P. vivax principally observe well patient tolerate Plasmodium infection change tumor-related parameter . The duration plan treatment 4-8 week , successful infection indicate microscopic observation parasitemia peripheral blood sample . The treatment last least 28 day day find Plasmodium peripheral blood terminate DUO-COTECXIN chloroquine phosphate plus primaquine phosphate . Each patient vaccinate 5-10 mL P. vivax-infected red blood cell contain approximately 1 × 10^8 Plasmodium parasite . After vaccination , onset duration peripheral parasitemia infection rate observe . Once infection rate reach 0.1 % , 10-30 mL venous blood drawn , test , frozen preserve blood parasitemia ( ensure except P. vivax , parameter meet blood donation standard ) , use vaccinate subsequent patient .</detailed_description>
