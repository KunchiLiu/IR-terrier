	<brief_summary>This study first clinical trial examine impact two different weight loss intervention novel mechanisms promote obesity impede successful treatment , include cognitive function self-regulatory factor . The result provide important data impair cognitive function and/or self-regulation promote obesity different weight loss treatment may differentially impact factor ; information use identify promise cognitive self-regulatory treatment target prevent obesity development maintain weight loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Self-regulatory Mechanisms Of Obesity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This K23 award allow Dr. Misty Hawkins , clinical psychologist expertise behavioral medicine obesity , develop independent investigator proficient physiological , neuropsychological , self-regulatory research method intervention allow study novel mechanism treatment obesity maintenance . She career interest intervene neuropsychological factor related obesity . Her research goal identify novel cognitive self-regulatory mechanism obesity pilot trial target large randomize control trial ( RCTs ) reduce obesity development maintain weight loss . Obesity continue global epidemic , yet successful intervention obesity rare , 80 % individual treatment program unsuccessful achieve long-term weight loss . The training research activity K23 application allow examine complexity physiological dysregulation , cognitive deficit , self-regulatory failure obesity treatment study . The application propose intensive , 5-year program mentor research formal training activity enhance Dr. Hawkins ' skill experience : 1 ) basic research assessment cognitive function ; ( 2 ) assessment obesity-related physiological change ; ( 3 ) research patient population ; ( 4 ) advance assessment self-regulation ( SR ) ; ( 5 ) conduct randomize clinical trial advance statistic . In long term , Dr. Hawkins apply translational research skill study target cognitive self-regulation intervention potentially effective treatment person obesity may exhibit cognitive deficit chronic self-regulatory failure . The research component career development award clinical trial examine impact two different weight loss treatment physiological marker , cognition , self-regulation , health behavior 96 obese person . The specific aim : 1 ) Confirm baseline obesity-related physiological dysregulation link cognitive deficit , poor self-regulation , obesogenic behavior , 2 ) Demonstrate two treatment group improvement biomarkers , cognition , SR , obesogenic behavior , less weight gain , great weight loss , 3 ) Evaluate whether acceptance-based treatment ( ABT ) group great improvement biomarkers , cognition , SR , obesogenic behavior , less weight gain , great weight loss standard behavioral treatment group ( SBT ) pre- post-treatment 1-year follow-up . Oklahoma State University research partner Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center provide exceptional environment Dr. Hawkins gain skill need achieve goal . The training component use academic resource include College Arts Sciences Department Psychology . Dr. Hawkins ' mentor highly regarded scientist area obesity , neuropsychology , psychophysiology , nutrition , patient-oriented research . **An open trial arm ABT add study September 2016 test feasibility ABT among member Cherokee Nation . This arm entitle POWER-UP : Pilot Of WEight Reduction Underserved Populations . Glucose biomarker measure POWER-UP .</detailed_description>
