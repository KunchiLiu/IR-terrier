	<brief_summary>The recent discovery functional brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) humans lead paradigm shift adipose tissue biology ; believe adipocytes may play significant role regulate substrate metabolism . Given resurgence interest human BAT still infancy , number fundamental question pertain role BAT human physiology remain unanswered . One area particular importance , poorly understood , potential effect BAT triglyceride ( TG ) metabolism . Data series study find BAT inversely associate adiposity , high blood lipid , fatty liver people . However , role BAT regulation TG metabolism people know . The overall goal study determine physiological importance human BAT TG metabolism . To end , plan study forty overweight/obese woman high amount BAT ( BAT+ , n=20 ) no/minimal BAT ( BAT- , n=20 ) thermoneutrality mild cold exposure ( ~2 week apart ) . The investigator hypothesize BAT+ subject demonstrate great plasma low density lipoprotein-triglycerides ( VLDL-TG ) clearance rate cold exposure compare BAT- subject upregulation gene protein involve lipid metabolism BAT ( muscle white adipose tissue ) . Infusion stable isotope tracer metabolic model technique use assess VLDL-TG kinetics . Positron emission tomography compute tomography use identification quantification BAT . Supraclavicular BAT , abdominal white adipose tissue , skeletal muscle tissue biopsy cold exposure thermoneutral condition conjunction molecular biology technique use measure expression gene protein involve lipid metabolism .</brief_summary>
