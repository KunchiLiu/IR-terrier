	<brief_summary>This project delay pragmatic delayed-intervention cluster randomize control study subset household ( n=600 ) enrol large scale program enhance homestead food production ( EHFP ) Cambodia . The trial design evaluate impact EHFP ( home garden ; home garden fishpond ; home garden poultry ) versus control group dietary intake woman young child , household food security , income production throughout agricultural cycle . Following administration baseline survey 300 household randomize EHFP package choosing ( Intervention Group ) two year . The 300 household receive intervention first year act control group ; data collect monthly production income generate gardening ( HFP activity ) two point throughout year 24-hour dietary recall data collect woman head household ( age 15-49y ) young child age 6 - 59 month . After one year , control group offer intervention ( EHFP package choice ) fully subsidize project team collect identical data intervention group one year describe control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scale Enhanced Homestead Food Production Cambodia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cambodia 's economy improve remarkably last decade , yet 80 % household experience form poverty , 20 % severely impoverish . Food insecurity sequela remain problem , especially among rural farmer . As solution HKI implement Homestead Food Production ( HFP ) model Cambodia . HFP , focus woman farmer , foster year-round environmentally sustainable production nutrient-rich fruit , vegetable animal-source food . The program provide initial farm input couple technical assistance , nutrition education , train marketing gender equity . In 2012 , HKI together UBC , conduct 22-month randomize control trial HFP , know 'Fish Farms ' . Using HKI 's approach , 900 woman farmer randomize three group : 1 ) plant-based HFP ; 2 ) HFP plus fishpond ; 3 ) control . Remarkably , less two year work woman farmer , Fish Farms establish 300 fishpond 600 garden . In fishpond , small nutrient-rich fish raise household consumption large fish raise consumption sale . After two year , household EHFP arm saw improvement food production , income generation , food security , dietary diversity , dietary intake certain micronutrient relative control . However , RCT approach number issue , gap need address identify . Attrition high , perhaps part well opportunity woman , also woman give choice type HFP activity participate . Further , project provide many input free woman invest might otherwise . Other issue identify lack market access sale produce fish , gender inequity , need good capture seasonality food production consumption household level . Building lesson learn pilot study ( Fish Farms ) , pragmatic delayed-intervention cluster randomize control study include rigorous monitoring production throughout agricultural cycle well multiple 24-hour dietary recall improve methodology frequency well capture dietary intake . Women self-selecting participate , provide access micro-credit institution cost-sharing option woman great financial stake EHFP lead successful farmer . Participants also able select EHFP option include home garden , poultry fish . The ultimate goal program provide evidence integrate model EHFP scalability sustainability improve livelihood Cambodians possibly large region .</detailed_description>
