	<brief_title>Integrated Primary Care Chronic Lung Disease : PACK Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long-lasting lung disease like asthma chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) - collectively call chronic respiratory disease ( CRD ) - place heavy grow burden people live low middle income country . Many could healthier disease accurately diagnose correctly treat , many . Doctors nurse work primary health care clinic best place people diagnose treat CRD , especially local clinic near free . But raise three question : 1 . How ensure CRDs get priority need overload clinic ? 2 . How train clinician diagnose manage CRDs without special test equipment ? 3 .

The investigator ' research Africa show approach effective , cost effective , feasible sustainable . It roll throughout South Africa African country . But yet show effective combination disease ( CRDs together cardiovascular disease , diabetes , tuberculosis back pain ) . The investigator also try evaluate Latin American country , different health system , many doctor provide primary health care . Now co-investigators Brazilian city Florianopolis decide put educational package place throughout city , agree randomise controlled trial . This clearly show whether PACK Brazil effective , cost effective feasible Brazilian condition . The core research randomise control trial . 48 primary care clinic city randomly choose either 1 ) get whole package patient management tool plus training , 2 ) get patient management tool ( expect make little difference without train ) . The investigator compare patient two group clinic see effect train . They use clinic ' electronic medical record identify 2000 adult diagnose asthma COPD .
