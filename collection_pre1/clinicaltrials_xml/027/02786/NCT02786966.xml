	<brief_summary>Each year , half million patient potential neck ( c-spine ) injury transport Ontario emergency department ( ED ) . Less 1 % patient actually neck bone fracture . Even less ( 0.5 % ) spinal cord injury nerve damage . These injury usually occur time initial trauma transport ED . Currently , paramedic transport trauma victim ( without injury ) ambulance use backboard , collar , head immobilizers . Trauma victim stay immobilized hour ED bed make available x-ray complete . Importantly , long immobilization often unnecessary , cause patient discomfort pain , decrease community access paramedic , contributes ED crowding , costly . The investigator develop Canadian C-Spine Rule ( CCR ) alert stable trauma patient . This decision rule help ED physician triage nurse safely selectively remove immobilization , without x-ray missed injury . The investigator evaluate possibility benefit allow paramedic use CCR field 12 new community across Ontario . Patients suggest investigator include measure pain discomfort immobilize transport important patient-centred outcome . The investigator also measure impact ED , much money could save paramedic allow use CCR . The investigator also assess sex , age , language barrier , live far hospital ( long transport time ) affect outcome study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pragmatic Evaluation Canadian C-Spine Rule Paramedics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paramedics participate Ontario community receive standardized training application Canadian C-Spine Rule ( CCR ) . Once train complete , paramedic begin use CCR evaluate patient potential c-spine injury . For first three month evaluation period , paramedic use CCR evaluate eligible patient , continue use spinal immobilization transport accord exist protocol . After validation period , participate service randomize step wedge fashion cluster 4 service actively use CCR selectively immobilize accord CCR .</detailed_description>
