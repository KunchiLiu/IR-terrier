	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize intervention pilot evaluate relative efficacy bystander training element ( delivery mode integration substance abuse prevention ) among cohort incoming undergraduate University Kentucky , nationally recognize leader address sexual violence bystander intervention programming . Consenting student randomize one follow training condition : 1 . In-person Green Dot Intensive Bystander-based Sexual Violence Prevention Training ( GreenDot ) ; 2 . In-person Green Dot Intensive Bystander Training combine Substance Abuse Prevention Training ; 3 . Online Bystander-based Sexual Violence Prevention Training ( Haven ) , ; 4 .

	<detailed_description>Rates sexual violence ( SV ) date violence ( DV ) remain high among college student ( 22 % past year female undergraduate ) . Binge drink commonly occur ( 25 % undergraduates report binge drink past month ) strong predictor sexual risk take violence victimization perpetration . Given connection SV/DV risk alcohol use abuse , many advocate prevention program jointly address SV/DV alcohol abuse . Bystander intervention , recognize promising violence prevention strategy , unique engagement community member 1 ) recognize situation may become violent 2 ) learn safely effectively intervene reduce violence risk . Based promise , Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act ( SaVE ) require publicly-funded college provide bystander intervention hop reduce sexual violence . No randomized intervention trial compare bystander intervention focus exclusively SV/DV prevention additionally address alcohol abuse prevention within bystander context . We propose experimental trial University Kentucky ( UK ) , nationally recognize leader address sexual violence bystander intervention programming . The purpose randomize intervention trial evaluate relative efficacy bystander training element . In study randomize one following : 1 ) Online Bystander Training ( Haven ) , 2 ) Online Substance Abuse Training ( AlcoholEdu ) , 3 ) In-person Bystander Training ( Green Dot Intensive Training ) , 4 ) In-person Bystander/Substance Abuse Training ( ConnectEd ) . Aim 1 : Evaluate method capture behavior diffusion train social medium communication ( e.g. , Facebook , Twitter , Instagram ) . Aim 2 : Determine relative efficacy three bystander training condition ) increase bystander efficacy behavior domain ( alcohol abuse violence prevention ) , b ) reduce acceptance SV/DV , alcohol 's role sexuality , alcohol use / abuse , c ) reduce risk take behavior domains sexual behavior alcohol use abuse . Aim 3 : Determine relative cost implementing bystander approach cost effectiveness . Design : Incoming UK undergraduates recruit randomized one four condition follow 9 month , one academic year ( n=4000 , total 2 academic year cohort ) . A mixed-method approach use measure intervention fidelity cost time condition . Using rigorous design available , seek generate new understand novel bystander intervention approach work reduce SV/DV risk take behavior also reduce alcohol abuse . Incoming student invited participate randomize trial test bystander program efficacy . Those consent study participation randomize one four condition . These condition include : 1 . In-person Green Dot Intensive Bystander-based Sexual Violence Prevention Training ( GreenDot ) ; 2 . In-person Green Dot Intensive Bystander Training combine Substance Abuse Prevention Training ( WellAware ) ; 3 . Online Bystander-based Sexual Violence Prevention Training ( Haven ) , ; 4 . Online Substance Abuse Training ( AlcoholEdu ) . All incoming student ( 17-24 ) agree study participation invite complete survey baseline ( prior training ) , end fall spring semester . Additionally , student ask complete micro-surveys use myUK app . Student recruitment conduct student enter UK summer orientation ( June July ) . We anticipate 45-50 % student agree study participation provide data ; thus final participant pool expect consist 4,000 participant academic year 2016 2017 . Continuous variable summarize descriptive statistic ( n , mean , standard deviation , median , first third quartile , min max ) ; categorical variable describe count percentage . Change score percent change score calculate baseline ( prior start first academic year ) well end Fall Spring within academic year . Numerical graphical summary provide overall , subpopulation within college community ( e.g. , gender , sexual attraction , fraternity/sorority athletic team membership ) importantly train condition . Simple comparison group make use ANOVA continuous variable chi-square test categorical outcome . Comparisons group conduct randomize ; simple comparison continuous variable group perform use ANOVA chi-square test independence categorical variable . Although group randomly assign , potential confounders examine bivariate analysis comparison require covariate adjustment use regression modeling ( e.g . ANCOVA , logistic regression ) . Planned subgroup analyse include analysis gender group , sexual attraction , Greek life participation . These also conduct randomize receive . Effect modification also assess include interaction regression model ( linear , logistic , mixed model depend outcome presence longitudinal measure ) . SAS v9.4 use data management statistical analysis ; significance level 0.01 used statistical test .</detailed_description>
