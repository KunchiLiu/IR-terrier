	<detailed_description>Syncope sudden transient loss consciousness follow spontaneous complete recovery ; common problem precursor sudden death . This study increase early identification patient serious underlying arrhythmia combine Canadian Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score ( CSARS ) innovative remote ( out-of-hospital ) monitoring technology . Approximately 2-3 % ED syncope patient suffer arrhythmia die unknown cause within 30-days ED disposition ( in-patient outside hospital ) . It concern occult arrhythmia associate mortality lead prolonged cardiac monitoring ED , observation unit hospitalization ; wide variation investigation hospitalization . New innovative technology make remote monitoring feasible prolonged period ( 15-30 day ) , reliable . This technology allow arrhythmias transmitted live central monitoring station automatically base device algorithm touch button patient symptomatic . However , lack tool identify risk limit use new technology improve patient outcomes . The CSARS tool , develop predict 30-day risk arrhythmia/death show higher-risk ( score ≥3 ) patient 17.2 % observe risk arrhythmia/death within 15 day . The aim randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare diagnostic yield 15-day event monitor 48-hour holter monitor ( usual care ) among higher-risk syncope patient discharge home 10 Canadian EDs . Context : Currently , holter monitoring ( record cardiac beat ) 1-2 day use prolonged monitoring device use arrhythmia detection . The majority syncope patient monitor symptomatic . Arrhythmias detect evident patient seek care . The investigator recently complete multicenter prospective syncope study develop Canadian Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score ( CSARS ) . Our result show serious condition identify within first hour ED among low moderate-risk patient higher-risk patient risk arrhythmia remain high 15 day indicate need prolong monitoring . Previous study Rationale : A small randomized study old technology require patient activation arrhythmia capture find high diagnostic yield holter ; utility limit due patient ' inability activate device symptom . Two small study unselected syncope patient , one prospective ( n=48 ) another registry analysis ( n=92 ) find diagnostic yield 30 - 38 % prolonged monitoring 7-33 day . The diagnostic yield holter 1-20 % base risk enrol patient . The role prolong cardiac monitoring among ED syncope patient well study . Only holter monitoring currently use , inconsistently apply day later . With technological advance , investigator hypothesize 15-day monitoring lead higher diagnostic yield holter plan apply device disposition high-risk patient discharge home . Objectives : The objective compare diagnostic yield ( detection serious arrhythmia require treatment cause death , exclusion arrhythmia symptom-rhythm correlation ) end 15-days 15-day external cardiac event monitor ( intervention ) usual care ( 48-hour holter monitor patient seek medical care 48-hours base symptom ) among high-risk ED syncope patient discharge home . Design Setting : The study multicenter two-arm , open label RCT conduct 10 EDs Patient Recruitment : Consecutive patient fulfill inclusion meet exclusion criterion approach recruitment participate EDs enrol informed write consent . Randomization : Patients randomize 1:1 ratio either receive 15-day event monitor Cardiophone 48-hour holter monitoring MCT device . Patients stratify base total CSARS score : 3-4 ; 5-6 ; 7-8 allocate use randomly permute block vary length . Allocations computer-generated independent statistician conceal research staff log password-protected Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) System locate within coordinate center website . Intervention : Enrolled patient receive outpatient investigation except monitor per discharge physician . Based allocation , patient receive either Cardiophone MCT device prior discharge home . Data Collection : Patient demographic , medical history , CSARS predictor , result physical examination investigation , patient disposition collect . The following device data obtain central monitoring station : quality recording , device failure ( rhythm capture death symptomatic ) , false alarm due artefact , time patient activation cardiophone device due symptom , rhythm abnormality detect symptom , monitor report patient arm . Patients complete questionnaire follow-up visit regard serious condition suffer , comfort secure felt cardiac monitoring . Post-ED Care Study Patients : All patient enrol study link local cardiology group urgent end study follow-up . Patients advise keep diary symptom 15-day monitoring period . Patients cardiophone arm option transmit rhythm symptomatic symptom-rhythm correlation report . Patients advise return device symptom diary local cardiology clinic next business day 15-day monitoring period . All monitoring report complete central monitoring station within 24-hours sent study cardiologist . In intervention ( cardiophone ) arm : 1 ) If serious arrhythmia detect , central monitoring station contact patient family member advise call 911 patient transport ED ; 2 ) If arrhythmias identify , central monitoring station provide interim report study cardiologist provide care . The study cardiologist decide need urgent follow-up time-frame within follow-up occur . For patient control arm MCT device , central monitoring station provide report 48-hour holter monitor event monitoring day 3 15 next day completion monitoring period ( day 3 16 respectively ) . Patients control arm clearly advised monitoring live seek care symptom usual . All patient monitor entire 15-days regardless early arrhythmia detect end study follow-up cardiology discus monitor result plan management deem appropriate . Duration Participation Withdrawal : Patients part study follow-up study cardiologist 15-day monitoring period within 1 - 2 week monitor completion . Patients free withdraw study time without provide reason without penalty loss benefit entitle number withdrawal monitor . However , monitor device serve allay fear arrhythmia death among patient , investigator expect withdrawal . There restriction medication procedure study period . Data Analysis : The primary analysis intent-to-treat compare diagnostic yield ( arrhythmia detection exclusion ) end 15-days use data 15-day monitoring intervention arm 48-hour holter monitoring follow arrhythmia detection exclusion patient seek care base symptom ( base 13-day event recording MCT device ) . Secondary analysis include per-protocol analysis . The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test use primary outcome , control stratification factor ( CSARS score ) . The effect intervention express risk difference 95 % confidence interval . Secondary analysis include multivariable logistic regression control potential confounders imbalance patient study arm . Descriptive statistic baseline characteristic , outcome , device performance include failure patient center measure ( adherence , comfort safety feeling ) . Additional analysis include comparison arrhythmias detect require treatment group . There interim analysis efficacy perform , investigator monitor trial safety detail Data Safety Monitoring Board section . Sample Size : Our sample size 300 patient per arm ( 600 total ) determine yield 80 % power detect absolute difference 10 % diagnostic yield study arm use chi-squared test 5 % level significance assume control arm event rate 17 % accounting 5 % attrition . A difference 10 % feasible base previous study report 18 % increase diagnostic yield prolong monitoring . Data Safety Monitoring Board : This independent committee comprise one emergency physician , one cardiologist biostatistician outside participate site . This board responsible safeguard interest safety trial participant review adverse event include death every 6 month study period . Anticipated Contributions : Our study first combine risk-stratification innovative technology decrease morbidity mortality , improve healthcare efficiency . This study create new knowledge regard role prolong live monitoring among high-risk syncope patient application device prior ED discharge . As monitoring live , timely management potentially life threaten arrhythmias possible apply syncope patient risk ventricular arrhythmia hospitalize solely cardiac monitoring . This represent paradigm shift patient monitor home low cost decreasing ED hospital crowding . These device alleviate fear occult arrhythmia death improve patient outcome .</detailed_description>
