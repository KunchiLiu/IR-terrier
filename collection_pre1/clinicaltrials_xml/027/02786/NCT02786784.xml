	<brief_summary>Patellofemoral pain ( PFP ) diagnose condition individual knee complaint . Studies reveal one third individual PFP suffer persistent complaint , indicate current treatment fail prevent chronicity symptom . Considering current treatment-strategies patient PFP seem unable avoid development chronic symptom , question arises underlie factor PFP understand sufficiently . Current research focus predominantly muscle strength assessment mean maximum voluntary contraction ( MVC ) , even though , weakness might cause reduce voluntary contraction also involuntary ability contract muscle fully , name arthrogenous muscular inhibition ( AMI ) . Although AMI proven present wide range knee joint pathology date remain unclear whether patient PFP weak inhibit . It remain also unclear exists causal link AMI biomechanical alteration . Previous study investigate influence exercise treatment muscular strength , function pain . However , date study investigate influence currently recommend exercise treatment AMI . Thus , analysis effect 6 week exercise treatment might yield insight specific exercise treatment reduce AMI , improve functional performance reduce pain . Methods : The investigator invite 40 participant PFP 40 healthy control take part study . As basis investigation kinematic , kinetic measure , surface electromyographic ( sEMG ) 4 low limb muscle take functional task . Muscle strength AMI quadriceps , muscle flexibility , posture assessment patella well foot carry . All participant PFP receive 6 week exercise programme follow . After six week , participant PFP attend Salford university , reassess . Expected outcome : The study investigate AMI present participant PFP AMI directly link functional performance . In addition study investigate specific exercise treatment reduce AMI improve functional performance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Arthrogenic Muscular Inhibition Patellofemoral Pain Response Exercise Programme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedures The test performed human performance laboratory University Salford , Manchester . Upon arrival laboratory , participant brief study objective investigation study equipment explain . They ask sign inform consent form , health history questionnaire . The health history questionnaire consist 13 question investigate potential risk associate study . The individual ask change short comfortable t-shirt . Strength arthrogenic muscle inhibition : The muscular inhibition quadriceps assess , maximal isometric contraction ( MVIC ) quadriceps interpolated twitch technique . The participant perform 5 time maximal contraction knee extensor additional electrical stimulation apply , perform isokinetic dynamometer ( Kin-Com ) knee flexion angle 90Â° . Then participant ask perform 5 time eccentric quadriceps contraction angular velocity 60 degrees/ second , full available range motion ( ROM ) 90 degree knee flexion maximum knee extension , quadriceps torque measure . Questionnaires : The participant PFP ask fill 3 different questionnaire : KOOS , AKPS/ Kujala score , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia . After recovery break , posture flexibility investigation execute . The examination foot posture perform use 6-item foot posture index ( FPI-6 ) . The patella alignment include lateral - medial displacement/ lateral -medial tilt ) , lateral-medial displacement assessment . Flexibility : The flexibility hamstring soleus muscle assess . Biomechanics : Following , researcher attach 40 retro-reflective marker skin low limb leg attach surface electromyographic electrodes four muscle figure 4 leg . The electrode placement perform accord SENIAM guideline . Suface EMG ( sEMG ) data collect vastus medialis , vastus lateralis , biceps femoris semitendinosus synchronise motion capture system Qualisys . After static 3-dimensional image ten infra-red camera obtain . The 3D kinematics ankle , knee , hip joint ground reaction force ( GRF ) record participant running , single leg squat step task . Treatment : The 6 week treatment exclusively conducted physiotherapist Salford Royal Hospital ( Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust , SRFT ) . Physiotherapist Salford Royal hospital introduce treatment programme participant . Additionally , participant receive booklet detailed description treatment programme , well access password protect website ( VIMEO ) watch video exercise . Assessment treatment outcomes 6 week At end 6 week exercise intervention , participant PFP attend human performance laboratory University Salford . The muscle strength , AMI , flexibility , posture assessment , well clinical assessment run step task individual measure investigate change AMI functional performance due treatment .</detailed_description>
