	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation During Hemodialysis Peripheral Muscle Strength Exercise Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial , randomize , parallel , open , two-arm , blind assessor , prospective . Patients chronic kidney disease hemodialysis , divide equally two group : group high frequency intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( HG ) group low frequency intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( LG ) . Randomization stratify accord gender use 4 block . Drug treatment establish group remain unchanged throughout study period . Assessments make first working day hemodialysis , follow notification consent medical team . Patients initially underwent anthropometric measurement vital sign , later carry assessment peripheral muscle strength , pulmonary function test , submaximal exercise capacity quality life questionnaire depression . After procedure , patient randomize select HG LG opaque envelope . These evaluation perform baseline 12 session completion protocol . Furthermore , ask chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient hemodialysis present late blood test clearance index ( Kt / V ) , creatinine , glomerular filtration rate . The evaluation pro-inflammatory cytokine regulatory plasma , enzyme marker muscle tropism , oxidative stress muscle injury patient CKD always hold end month routine clinical . Two group conduct train peripheral electrical stimulation isometric form lateral medial bilaterally vast , hold three time week , last hour , first two hour dialysis . Will apply use portable stimulators 4 channel . The parameter : - HG : frequency 50 Hertz ( Hz ) , pulse width 400 microsecond ( μs ) , rise time fall time 2 second ( ) , : stimulation , initially 1:2 relation first week ( 10 stimulation 20 rest , objective adapt minimize effect muscular fatigue ) , increase 1:1 relation second week ( 10 stimulation 10 rest ) . - LG : frequency 5 Hz , : stimulation time 1:3 ( 10 stimulation 30 rest ) pulse duration 100 μs . For group , current intensity adjust individually first application . In HG , intensity gradually increase visible muscle contraction could observe : maximum intensity tolerate patient . In LG , intensity least noticeable patient . These value monitor calculation intensity evolution throughout train program . The blood pressure ( BP ) measure baseline , 30 minute end session heart rate ( HR ) monitor every 10 minute use oximeter . In session warm-up period , train slowdown . The first minute start 20 % intensity value use last session gradual increase 20 % per minute 5 minute , follow 50 minute training period finish 5 minute recovery period gradual reduction 20 % intensity every minute . Before training , patient ask feeling fatigue / tiredness lower limb use modified Borg scale . If report muscle pain , intensity assess visual analogue scale visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . They recruit 76 patient sex , accept hemodialysis treatment least 6 month . 38 patient allocate HG 38 LG . The sample size calculation perform order advance GPower 3.1 program base result obtain study conduct neuromuscular electrical stimulation hemodialysis patient chronic kidney disease . value peripheral muscle strength use treatment respectively 185.4 ± 53 222.4 ± 36.6 value assessment pre exercise capacity ( 401.3 ± 55 ) post ( 428.9 ± 69.2 ) wait electrostimulation observe similar effect . Using error 5 % ( 80 % test power ) , determine need inclusion 12 patient variable peripheral muscle strength 34 patient exercise capacity . Recital 10 % loss would require evaluation treatment 14 38 patient check effect peripheral muscle strength exercise capacity respectively . Safety : The main negative effect electrical stimulation muscle discomfort / fatigue low limbs training . Patients ask begin end training sense fatigue / tiredness member , well feel muscle pain . In addition , current adjust individually gradually increased shape patient consent . In case patient feel discomfort , intensity electric current reduce , require protocol stop improvement symptom . Statistical analysis : The data systematize IBM SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) version 20.0 . The data present mean ± standard deviation median interquartile range frequency . To verify data normality Shapiro-Wilk test apply . To compare behavior variable group use independent test parametric variable test U Mann Whitney nonparametric . As comparing average pre post use electrical stimulation use ANOVA test repeat measurement Friedman test check relationship respiratory muscle strength exercise capacity use Pearson correlation coefficient Spearman , accord normal distribution data . The significance level statistical treatment 5 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients CKD diagnostic dialysis regularly least 6 month , stable medical supervision . Patients without uncontrolled hypertension , recent ischemic heart disease ( 3 month less ) , unstable angina severe cardiac arrhythmia . Patients without disease limit electrical stimulation protocol ( respiratory , orthopedic / neurological ) . Patients form physical training hold six month . Inability perform study assessment ( lack understand collaboration ) . Recent decompensation clinical picture without hospitalization . Presence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD emphysema ) , musculoskeletal disease impede realization assessment train protocol . Uncontrolled hypertension , recent ischemic heart disease ( 3 month less ) , unstable angina severe cardiac arrhythmia . Abnormal sensitivity lower limb .</criteria>
