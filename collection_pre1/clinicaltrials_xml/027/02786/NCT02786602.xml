The clinical impact level LRP-1 expression overall survival cancer patient assess two study : one patient suffer hepatocellular carcinoma one patient suffer primitive lung adenocarcinoma . In study , decrease immunohistochemical gene expression LRP-1 correlate overall survival decrease . The clinical prognostic impact LRP-1 expression CRC association particular molecular morphological profile study date . In work , investigator study methylation pattern LRP-1 gene promoter well-characterized series CRC . The main objective study study methylation analysis role LRP-1 promoter gene methylation prognosis CRC . The secondary objective study evaluate prognostic impact CIMP . This study first explore LRP-1 gene promoter methylation CRC . This study help increase knowledge prognostic role LRP-1 gene promoter methylation CRC possible association clinical , morphological molecular parameter . This study single center retrospective cohort study . The investigator first design list eligible patient use request software DIAMIC th pathology department component code `` colon '' , damage code `` adenocarcinoma `` period `` 2006 2012 '' . Patients suffer Lynch syndrome familial cancer syndrome exclude study . Informed consent send select patient . Once patient list complete : - The patient ' medical record review : sociodemographic clinical data colonic tumor location , TNM stage , MSI , RAS BRAF status , presence synchronous metastasis , treatment type duration , patient follow date 01/06/2016 point ( metastasis occurrence , disease recurrence , patient death , ... ) . - A central review pathological slide perform criterion : adenocarcinoma subtype accord WHO 2010 classification , differentiation , association polyp type , pTNM stage , invasion front budding , stroma type , presence amount tumor necrosis ) . - Methylation analysis : - LRP1 gene promoter methylation analysis pyrosequencing . - CIMP status determination High Resolution Melting analysis MLH1 , MINT1 , MINT2 , MINT31 CDKN2A gene promoter . Statistical analysis : - Data description : mean standard deviation quantitative variable ; number percentage categorical variable . - Comparison tumor high methylation LRP-1 gene promoter tumor little methylation LRP-1 gene promoter univariate analysis ( Student 's test Wilcoxon test , Chi2 Fisher 's exact ) multivariate ( logistic regression ) . - Search factor associate patient outcome , include methylation LRP1 promoter CIMP status , univariate analysis ( log-rank test ) multivariate ( Cox model ) .</detailed_description>
