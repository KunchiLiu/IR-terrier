	<brief_summary>A large body evidence point impairment decode emotional stimulus Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . These change seem relate dysfunction mesocorticolimbic projection lead dysfunction limbic cortico-subcortical loop , throughout basal ganglion , project limbic cortical region anterior cingulate cortex orbitofrontal cortex , know involved emotional processing . Thus , presumably occurrence non-motor psychic symptom fluctuation PD would also rely degeneration circuitry . Dopamine modulation emotion frequently report healthy subject PD patient , effect subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation ( STN-DBS ) mood symptom controversial still paucity data demonstrate role emotional processing . The objective study ass compare behavioral electrophysiological effect dopamine STN-DBS PD emotional processing . To , Emotional Stroop task , version classical Stroop test develop investigate inhibition emotional interference , perform STN-DBS PD patient four different treatment condition high resolution electroencephalographic cortical mapping conduct . Using approach , investigator expect good separate mechanism psychic feature relate either disease , dopaminergic treatment , subthalamic stimulation association , final aim optimize clinical management PD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>How Does STN-DBS Influence Emotional Conflict Decision Parkinson 's Disease : EEG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-motor symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) particularly mood manifestation apathy , depression anxiety gain attention last decade due high frequency impact patient 's quality life . In addition , psychic non-motor feature show fluctuate alike motor symptom , concur non-motor fluctuation ( NMF ) disable motor symptom . The physiopathological basis psychic NMF unclear mesolimbic dopaminergic denervation suggest underlie mood manifestation off-periods . At time , demonstrate PD patient suffer abnormal emotional processing deficit facial expression recognition emotional prosody especially concern negative valanced emotion , impairment could also link mesolimbic dopaminergic mechanism . The mesolimbic pathway one functional cortico-subcortical loop basal ganglion segregate . It lie ventral subportion nucleus ( ventromedial case subthalamic nucleus ) mediodorsal thalamus project orbito-frontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , limbic cortical area robust evidence involve pathophysiology mood disturbance emotional process like facial expression recognition emotional conflict resolution . In summary , way dopamine depletion nigrostriatal pathway origin parkinsonian motor triad , lack dopamine mesolimbic loop would account non-motor psychic manifestation include apathy , anxiety , depression disturbance emotional decoding . A proper way explore phenomena task involve exposure affective stimulus . The Stroop Test tool allow explore selective attention , cognitive conflict resolution ( inhibition irrelevant read automatism ) processing speed , usually apply evaluate executive function . A modified version , facial Emotional Stroop ( ES ) , develop order address interference irrelevant affective distractors . With task , author demonstrate healthy volunteer , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex amygdala area implicate emotional conflict monitoring whereas rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC ) activation associate emotional conflict resolution top-down inhibition amygdala order avoid interference new irrelevant emotional distracters . The group design variant task add non-emotional cognitive trial subject identify gender face instead affect . Through paradigm , able dissociate neural net involve cognitive conflict resolution specifically involved emotional conflict resolution . Hence , lateral prefrontal cortex ( LPFC ) show resolve non-emotional conflict , pregenual part anterior cingulate cortex , , rACC involve emotional conflict resolution . On contrary , detection type conflict share activation common region dorsal anterior cingulate cortex . By use ES task , group recently demonstrate functional MRI study PD patient dopamine modulates emotional conflict resolution `` normalizing '' activity rACC , hypoactivate off-drug state compare on-drug state healthy control . The rACC receive massive dopamine projection ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , thus part cortico-subcortical limbic loop . Therefore , finding would support implication circuitry emotional decoding disturbance PD match hypothesis propose dopaminergic mesolimbic degeneration would underlie mood manifestation psychic NMF disorder . It well demonstrate STN-DBS improve levodopa-sensitive motor symptom PD . STN-DBS change overall cognitive function , except impairment executive function like verbal fluency , experimental scenario , prove increase impulsivity cognitive task PD patient . However , clinical effect affective domain PD highly controversial limit data regard emotional processing . A available study compare patient surgery point worsen facial emotion prosody recognition . These finding could replicate recent work . Such study however take account desensitization dopaminergic system relate marked decrease medication STN DBS . Because major change dopaminergic treatment chronic desensitization study compare stimulation condition interpret cautiously . In opinion , due large available clinical data demonstrate behavioral change STN-DBS , consider anatomic overlap STN functional subdivision , likely stimulation would exert effect limbic basal ganglia loop even electrodes well implanted sensorimotor territory thus , induce change motor affective domain , even though dissociation . With rationale , investigator aim reproduce electrophysiological perspective functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) evidence limbic cortical region involvement emotional decoding process differentiate involve cognitive conflict . In addition , investigator want confirm dopamine modulation deal emotional conflict , elucidate STN-DBS effect behavioral cortical electrophysiological term .</detailed_description>
