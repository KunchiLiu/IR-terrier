	<brief_summary>Patients suspect tree-nut sesame allergy base sensitization skin-prick test ( SPT ) , assess allergy use component analysis basophil activation test ( BAT ) enter oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) . Component analysis BAT repeat completion OIT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Positive Food Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit pool patient refer investigator center evaluation food allergy . For tree-nut ( walnut , pecan , cashew , pistachio , hazelnut almond ) evaluate , 30 patient ( age 4-45 year old ) , allergy least one tree-nut recruit database pool refer . Skin prick test ( SPT ) BAT perform suspected allergen . Sera take send ThermoFisher IgE IgG4 bind analysis purify component . Open OFCs perform tree-nut , unless clinically contraindicate . The result OFC form basis determine sensitivity specificity component test . Similarly , 40 patient suspected sesame allergy administer SPT component analysis sesame , correlation OFC . The investigator also utilize BAT directly test whether identify purified component sufficient elicit reactivity . This objective met either utilize saved patient serum naive basophil directly subsequently obtain blood sample patient . For patient enrol OIT ( secondary objective ) , serum also take completion therapeutic regimen , IgE well IgG4 bind component assess compare pre-OIT result . 4.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND METHODS 4.3 Patients group OFC allergy status result tree-nut ( patient document IgE-mediated reaction previous year positive OFC vs. patient regular consumption index food negative OFC ) . Descriptive statistic ( proportion categorical variable , mean median standard deviation inter-quartile range continuous variable ) report key participant variable , include baseline demographic characteristic , SPT , BAT component test result . For primary objective , sensitivity specificity diagnostic test ( wheal SPT , CD63 induction BAT ) IgE/IgG4 bind purified component predict OFC result allergy compare receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) analysis . To end , investigator evaluate molecular allergen singly group predictive utility . For secondary objective , OFC positive patient document allergy undergo OIT tree-nuts ( n=15 tree-nut ) sesame ( n=15 ) group accord OIT outcome . Paired t-tests compare IgE IgG4 bind specific molecular allergen individual patient treatment perform . Additionally , pre-OIT IgE IgG4 profile particular molecular allergen compare OIT outcome group t-test . Power analysis : Using Pearson Chi-square test two proportion , assumption 75 % OFC+ tree-nuts positive least one specific component , order detect result P-value &lt; 0.05 , 15 positive 15 negative serum tree-nut would yield power 0.816 . Based investigator experience immunoreactivity assess western blot , fact investigator would expect much 75 % OFC+ patient would show IgE reactivity least one component . Thus , investigator feel total thirty serum tree-nut suffice analysis . Total number patient : 180 patient evaluate tree-nut allergy 40 sesame allergy .</detailed_description>
