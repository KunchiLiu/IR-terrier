	<brief_summary>This prospective multicentre observational study assess sensitivity UroMark assay detect bladder cancer participants new recurrent disease . The study recruit patient newly detect recurrent bladder cancer . The reference standard histopathological confirmation tumour stage ( Ta , T1 , â‰¥T2 ) grade 1 , 2 3 disease without CIS , CIS alone . Patients visual diagnosis bladder cancer follow cystoscopy approach ask consent study . Consenting participant provide urine sample collection kit ask provide urine sample . Samples provide home post receive lab use stamp address envelope . The urine sample must obtain TURBT follow TURBT , patient NMIBC require surveillance cystoscopy ask provide urine sample 3 monthly interval 2 year . The study conduct least 11 NHS trust . As DETECT II observation study require provision urine sample , possible patient DETECT II recruit trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study observational study participant receive standard care accord local MDT guideline treatment surveillance bladder cancer . As study involve collection urine sample , subject permit entered trial . The DETECT II study recruit patient newly diagnose recurrent bladder cancer . As study observational intervention trial related patient give minimum 24 hour consider study decide take part approach clinic first instance . Due initial urine sample require standard care receive consent within 24 hour inform study . Most newly diagnose bladder cancer detect patient investigated haematuria attend haematuria clinic . Most recurrent bladder cancer detect cystoscopy bladder cancer check cystoscopy clinic . Patients visual diagnosis new recurrent bladder cancer eligible DETECT II study . The baseline UroMark urine collection collect visual diagnosis bladder cancer establish . The UroMark sample must provide TURBT case . Patients approach follow cystoscopy ask consent study entry . The DETECT II study involve obtain void urine sample . Patients give UroMark urine sample kit ask provide urine sample home post sample receive lab use stamp address envelope . Patients receive standard test investigation bladder cancer . The standard treatment bladder cancer summarise : - TURBT follow recommend patient NMIBC receive single instillation chemotherapy unless contraindicate . - Intermediate risk NMIBC consider 6 week inductive course intravesical chemotherapy TURBT . - High risk NMIBC may require second TURBT call re-resection TURBT , usually within 6 week first . The -- resection second TURBT perform pathological stage pT1 tumours exclude residual detrusor muscle invasion ( stage pT2 least ) . There 2 treatment choice high risk status confirm clinically : - A course inductive follow maintenance intravesical BCG - An operation remove bladder ( cystectomy ) . - Cystectomy radiotherapy option patient diagnose MIBC</detailed_description>
