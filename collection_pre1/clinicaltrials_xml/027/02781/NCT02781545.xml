	<brief_summary>Infants require surgery neonatal period complex congenital heart diseases risk developmental problem . For infant congenital heart diseases admixture physiology single ventricle , optimal circulation associate sign adequate systemic perfusion systemic arterial oxygen saturation typically 75 % 90 % . Infants often unable withstand standardize developmental test early infancy due medical fragility sternal precaution surgery . Evaluation quality spontaneous movement movement variability good alternative . The quality general movement early infancy valid predictor neurological disorder high risk infant group assess short period video-recorded observation . This methodology yet studied infant complex congenital heart disease require surgery neonate . For old infant , Infant Motor Profile ( IMP ) promise tool document developmental outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Congenital heart defect ( CHD ) condition present birth affect heart structure , function , manner blood flow heart rest body . The incidence severe CHD 2.5 3/1,000 live birth . With improvement cardiac surgical technique critical care medicine , vast majority baby CHD expect survive school age beyond . However , surgical medical advance also associate increase risk neurodevelopmental morbidity . Traditionally , quantitative approach measure gross motor development infant risk delay , include child complex congenital heart disease . These tool emphasize elicited response ; however , clinical use validity may limit infant 's behavioral state , unstable physiological status , intolerance handling , sternal/surgical precaution . Alternatively , European clinician work field developmental neurology realize variation adaptability motor behavior may assist evaluation motor development . The application motor variation adaptability mean evaluate neuromotor condition early infancy significant early detection infant high risk developmental problem cerebral palsy number study high-risk infant group . This form evaluation yet studied infant complex congenital heart disease . The propose study aim study motor development two infant group base oxygen saturation target neonatal surgery study validity assessment tool base quality movement variation adaptability , i.e. , General Movements Assessment ( GMsA ) Infant Motor Profile ( IMP ) infants complex congenital heart disease . Hypothesis : Baseline oxygen saturation neonatal heart surgery child complex congenital heart diseases determinant motor performance outcome 18 month Infant Motor Profile . Specific Objectives : 1 . To determine developmental outcome 18 month two infant group base oxygen saturation target . 2 . To validate specific neuromotor assessment tool determine developmental outcome two infant group base oxygen saturation target . Specific Aims : 1 . To compare motor outcomes 18 month measure IMP two group infant surgery neonate complex congenital heart disease group baseline oxygen saturation target first surgery ( â‰¥ 90 % ; high saturation &lt; 90 % ; low saturation , i.e. , admixed lesion ) . 2 . To describe quality general movement birth three month five assessment point infant high oxygen saturation infant low oxygen saturation . 3 . To describe motor development term IMP-scores 6 , 12 18 month infant high oxygen saturation infant low oxygen saturation . 4 . To explore predictive value GMsA three month pool group infant high oxygen saturation low oxygen saturation development outcome 18 month assess : 1 . Infant Motor Profile ( IMP ) 2 . Alberta Infant Motor Scales ( AIMS ) 3 . Motor Composite score Bayley Scales Infant Development , 3rd edition ( BSID-3 ) 4 . Cognitive Language composite score BSID-3 . 5 . To determine concurrent validity Infant Motor Profile ( IMP ) basis comparison : 1 . Alberta Infant Motor Scales ( AIMS ) 6 , 12 , 18 month . 2 . Bayley Motor Composite score 18 month .</detailed_description>
