	<detailed_description>During first 30 40 minute anaesthesia , patient 's temperature drop 35.0°C . Reasons include loss behavioural response cold impairment thermoregulatory heat-preserving mechanism general regional anaesthesia , anaesthesia-induced peripheral vasodilation , use cold dry insufflation gas . For reason , institution employ range technique prevent hypothermia , include force air warm ( peri-operatively ) , use warm intravenous fluid , temperature monitoring control room temperature . Despite intervention audit demonstrate 20-56 % patient hypothermic perioperative period . A factor often dismiss cause peri-operative hypothermia laparoscopic procedure dry cold insufflation gas . During laparoscopic procedure abdomen continuously insufflate cold , dry CO2 result desiccation heat loss consequently induce hypothermia patient . Clinical evidence suggest risk hypothermia reduce use warm humidify gas , show animal model , clinical trial confirm metaanalysis human . Only gas body temperature fully saturate moisture prevent loss energy peritoneum surface - physically possible evaporate fluid fully saturate gas . Therefore , fluid layer maintain , minimize energy loss body , decrease hypothermia induce evaporative loss laparoscopic surgery stabilize fibrinolytic activity peritoneum . The aim investigation assess impact force air warming , warm humidify insufflation gas combination two intraoperative temperature maintenance postoperative pain course well fibrinolytic activity peritoneal fluid follow laparoscopic procedure ( duration &gt; 60 min ) prospective , randomize , control , double-blinded mono-centric study . Therefore 150 subject randomize 3 group 50 subject . First group treat forced-air warm blanket ( bair hugger ) . Second group treat warm , humidified insufflation via F &amp; P HumiGard™ Surgical Humidification System . Third group treat , warm blanket warm , humidified insufflation . The peri-operative temperature patient might high patient third group combination treatment . The investigator hypothesize VAS score pain ( especially shoulder pain ) , MEDD usage differ group .
