	<brief_summary>This observational prospective study . For patient present Emergency Department loss consciousness , emergency physician ask screen real syncope without evident immediate cause loss consciousness ( e.g . vasovagal ) and/or least one high risk condition list European Society Cardiology 2009 Guidelines diagnosis management syncope ( i.e . severe structural coronary artery disease , clinical ECG feature suggest arrhythmic syncope , important co-morbidities ) . In case real syncope clearly physiopathologically explain high risk condition , emergency physician charge check risk factor high risk syncope categorize every case . A high risk syncope characterize least one high-risk characteristic ( base 2015 `` Syncope clinical management emergency department consensus '' ) : syncope exertion , supine position , new onset chest discomfort , palpitation loss consciousness , family history sudden death , congestive heart failure , aortic stenosis , leave ventricular outflow tract disease , dilate cardiomyopathy , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy , leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35 % , previously document ventricular arrhythmia , coronary artery disease , congenital heart disease , previous myocardial infarction , pulmonary hypertension , previous ICD implantation , anemia ( i.e . Hb &lt; 9 g/dl ) , low systolic blood pressure ED &lt; 90 mmHg , sinus bradycardia ( &lt; 40 bpm ) , new ( previously unknown ) leave bundle branch block , bifascicular block plus first degree AV block , Brugada ECG pattern , ECG change consistent acute ischemia , new non-sinus rhythm , bifascicular block , prolong QTc ( &gt; 450 m ) . Low intermediate risk syncope enrol evaluated use integrated point-of-care sonographic approach ( base history , physical exam , electrocardiogram , lung , focus cardiac venous compression ultrasonography ) . After discharge , risk patient 's syncope determine review entire medical record .</brief_summary>
