	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause permanent disability develop country world wide one-third surviving patient stroke fail regain independent walk ability . Robot-assisted gait rehabilitation able deliver high intensity consistent repeatability safe control environment gain traction advocator inclusion part routine post-stroke rehabilitation program . However , despite recent technological advance development design well robotics , exact benefit robot-assisted therapy traditional rehabilitation remain sparse unclear . It therefore aim propose project fulfil important gap clinical knowledge comparatively investigate clinical feasibility efficacy recently develop HIWIN Robotic Gait Training System ( MRG-P100 ) traditional rehabilitation program emphasis determination functional recovery appropriate gait adaptation robotic system stroke survivor .</detailed_description>
