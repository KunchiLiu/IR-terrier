	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Statins reduce cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk recommend part treatment strategy primary secondary prevention CVD NHS . Although statin commonly prescribe treatment UK , still uncertainty adverse effect . Severe statin adverse effect extremely rare ( rhabdomyolysis 0.1 myopathy 0.5 per 1000 people 5 year ) . However , widespread reporting less well-defined statin-related symptom medium , notably muscle pain weakness . These report largely prompt data non-randomised , non-blinded observational study confirm blind randomise control trial ( RCTs ) . A major limitation observational study lack blinding : patient take medication expect experience adverse effects10 therefore report symptom may higher comparable statin-free population . This phenomenon , `` nocebo '' effect , lead bias unblinded study . In RCTs expectation adverse effect lead inflated reporting active placebo group . In Odyssey ALTERNATIVE trial , statin 'intolerant ' patient initially underwent double blind four week phase receive placebo . Interestingly , time , 7 % drop due myalgia . In main phase three arm trial ( alirocumab v ezetimibe v atorvastatin ) , rate adverse event across group roughly 80 % , drop 55 % among alirocumab unblinded . Therefore trial statin , expectation adverse effect among placebo active treatment arm may dilute true effect statin muscle symptom . A systematic review randomise trial statin find prevalence myalgia vary 0 % 30 % , different active placebo arm . There also two important criticism exist RCT evidence . First , trial collect data subjective symptom record may inconsistent due definition use . Studies show adverse event rarely fully present journal publication . Second , trial among specific vulnerable patient group , perception trial participant reflect population take statin routine care . The investigator work closely Cholesterol Treatment Trialists ' Collaboration perform meta-analysis statin adverse event report RCTs statin , determine use individual participant data whether excess adverse event among allocated statin compare placebo , whether date bias report adverse event statin trial . However , reason outline , re-analysis exist evidence may alleviate individual patient concern . Despite evidence-based recommendation risk benefit statin use , many patient believe symptom due statin , lead discontinuation , therefore potentially miss needlessly effective drug intervention . GPs face challenge decision making patient present symptom statin use currently diagnostic tool allow clinician empirically evaluate whether symptom report individual statin-user cause statin 'nocebo ' effect . N-of-1 trial offer opportunity individual patient discover whether symptom experience attributable statin . Each patient act control , therefore optimal treatment establish . Importantly , N-of-1 trial offer individual patient opportunity observe response active placebo treatment . The investigator anticipate knowledge important determinant subsequent statin use therefore investigator follow patient three month blind treatment period end . At end three month investigator ascertain whether use statin . The propose trial address criticisms previous evidence . The trial blind placebo-controlled minimise bias sequence statin placebo treatment randomise avoid confounding . Additionally , within-patient comparison symptom experience placebo statin allow u determine , definitively : ( ) whether individual patient symptom cause statin ( ii ) extent symptom attribute statin appear causally relate . Trial design 2.1 Overview StatinWISE randomise , double blind , placebo control N-of-1 trial take place primary care setting , quantify occurrence self-reported muscle symptom whilst take daily atorvastatin . A total 200 patient fulfill eligibility criterion recruit . 2.2 Optional Genetic study A genetic component statin myopathy ( pain accompany rise CK ALT ) suggest ( SLCO1B1 variant ) . However , clear whether variant find among patient include study ( experienced muscle symptom statins substantial rise CK ALT ) . Therefore , part trial , investigator ask patient provide blood sample optional genetic analysis part large collaborative effort investigate genetic association statins effect . Specific result feed back clinician patient . Where patient consent genetic blood test , one nine milliliter blood sample obtain EDTA Vacutainer tube , label genetic study ID number , patient 's gender , date time sample collection . It send genetics laboratory University Liverpool via first class post pre-paid Royal Mail Safeboxes ( contain maximum four tube ) soon possible collection . No patient identifiable data include separately provide University Liverpool . 2.3 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS NEEDED A feasibility study Clinical Practice Research Datalink indicate average 35 patient per practice per year eligible take part trial . The investigator anticipate average uptake 15 % among primary care patient invited participate trial . Therefore , investigator estimate investigator need invite approximately 1300 patient 50 general practice trial achieve recruitment target 200 . Power calculation : Our power calculation perform via simulation . An initial sample size , n , chosen . The treatment allocation sequence n patient draw randomly allocate participant either statin placebo separately periods 1 , 3 , 5 , thereby determine order 6 treatment period . For participant , random effect drawn normal distribution , zero mean variance equal 302 . Residual error ( 6 participant ; one period ) drawn normal distribution zero mean variance equal 252 . Then VAS pain score simulate participant period , add treatment effect 13 statin period , incorporate patient random effect participant 's residual error period . This simulated dataset analyse use primary analysis model ( real data ) two-sided P-value treatment effect store . After repeat process large number time ( e.g . 500 ) , statistical power estimate proportion simulate datasets P-value le 0.05 . If power le 90 % , sample size increase power re-estimated . The rationale parameter choose within model detail . Minimum clinically significant difference VAS pain score ( 10 mm ) : This value choose represent small VAS change pain patient would perceive beneficial , might therefore change patient 's decision regard subsequent statin use . Two study conduct within Accident Emergency set conclude small change VAS pain score correspond `` little '' `` little less '' pain 13mm , confidence interval ( 95 % CI : 10 17mm ) ( 95 % CI : 10 16mm ) . The investigator take low limit confidence interval represent small change likely perceive beneficial . Within between-participant variability VAS pain score : ( 〖30〗^2 〖35〗^2 , respectively ) . These value obtain fit mixed model data pilot series N-of-1 trial statin adverse effect ( data obtain approximation figure present therein ) . These variance component poorly estimate , thus take value higher end confidence interval , give conservative estimate component . 2.4 SAMPLE SIZE A sample size 64 participant provide approximately 90 % power detect treatment effect least 10mm , assume Type I error 5 % . Allowing loss follow-up 40 % participant trial inflates require sample size 107 participant . Period effect ( change underlie VAS pain score due factor randomise treatment , e.g . seasonal , activity-related , etc . ) , variability individual statin effect across patient , imperfect adherence assign treatment investigate detailed simulation . VAS pain score normally distribute , since bound ( 0-100mm ) display large fluctuation response . Therefore , power calculation perform draw outcome Beta distribution , distribution normal variance component logit scale , assess robustness sample size estimate distribution choose . These factor effect decrease power , thus increase sample size require . An approximate 80 % increase sample size require absence effect provide approximately 90 % power across plausible range potential effect , thus investigator determine final sample size 200 require . Multiple testing : Rather make formal adjustment multiple testing , investigator follow approach advocate Pocock clearly specify primary analysis ( provide single test treatment effect ) , explicitly present interpret test secondary analysis . Power individual N-of-1 trial : In order increase statistical power analysis individual N-of-1 trial , investigator ask participant report symptom daily last week period , rather per period . Full adherence trial provide 55 70 % power detect effect 10mm great individual treatment comparison . Estimates recruitment retention rate : The investigator anticipate patient complete data treatment period , complete 12-month follow-up . By design study series N-of-1 trial , offer individual participant benefit form individualised estimate effect , investigator hope minimise type dropout . However , investigator account sample size calculation allow 40 % loss follow-up . 2.5 SETTINGS General Practitioner ( GP ) Practices recruit Clinical Research Network across England Wales investigator continue add practice ensure sample size achieve . Suitable collaborating practice investigator assess ability conduct trial . In advance trial start practice , Principal Investigator ( PI ) must agree follow Good Clinical Practice Guidelines relevant regulation . All relevant regulatory ethic approval must place prior practice recruit first patient . 2.6 RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS Participating practice recruit eligible patient two group follow : Patients consider discontinuation statin due muscle symptom : These patient invite take part trial visit GP report muscle symptom believe associated statin patient/GP consider stop statin muscle symptom . The GP Research Nurse approach patient give patient information sheet ( Appendix 6 ) . If interested , patient able consent ( Appendix 7 ) complete screen visit GP Research Nurse appointment arrange another suitable time . Patients stop take statin last 3 year due muscle symptom : A search practice electronic record perform Research Nurse two-monthly basis one year ( recruitment target reach ) identify potentially eligible patient . All screen patient document screen log . The list review GP confirm clinical eligibility patient invite take part . A letter invite attend screen visit , accompany patient information sheet ( Appendix 6 ) patient consider , send trial team GP practice . Contact detail Research Nurse provide patient question . A reply slip enclose patient complete wish attend screen visit , return Clinical Trials Unit ( CTU ) , trial explain , opportunity ask question . Patients send letter invitation consider participation maximum three time . Once informed consent obtain , eligibility , demographic medical history data ( Appendix 1 ) collect directly onto online trial database . 2.7 ELIGIBILITY Inclusion criterion : Adults ( age 16 ) Registered participate GP practice Previously prescribe statin treatment last 3 year Stopped OR consider stop statin treatment due muscle symptom Provided fully inform consent . Exclusion criterion : Any previously document serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level three time upper limit normal Have persistent , generalise , unexplained muscle pain ( whether associate statin use ) creatinine kinase ( CK ) level great 5 time upper limit normal Should participate trial opinion general practitioner . 2.8 RANDOMISATION Patients eligible inclusion randomise Research Nurse/GP practice trial team use online London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM ) CTU randomisation system sequence blind placebo atorvastatin treatment period . There six pair ( statin-placebo placebo-statin ) treatment period two month ' duration . In practice , mean individual randomise ( equal probability ) one follow eight sequence ( P=placebo , S=statin ) : Treatment Period 1 2 3 4 5 6 Sequence 1 S P S P S P Sequence 2 S P S P P S Sequence 3 S P P S S P Sequence 4 S P P S P S Sequence 5 P S S P S P Sequence 6 P S S P P S Sequence 7 P S P S S P Sequence 8 P S P S P S Randomisation code generate secured Information Technology team LSHTM CTU , procedures ensure trial team remain blind . The code make available Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) certify clinical trial supply company explicitly treatment pack create accordance randomisation list . 2.9 TREATMENT The trial treatment consist once-daily oral administration Atorvastatin ( 20mg ) capsule , compare match placebo ( Microcrystalline Cellulose ) . The treatment phase trial one year duration patient . A blinded placebo , identical size , colour , smell package active statin , choose prevent knowledge treatment affect symptom score . Two month ' supply allocate treatment post patient every 2 month . Treatment start within 4 week randomisation . Patients start 3rd week post randomisation contact CTU . Such patient therefore longer study period . 2.9.1 DOSE SELECTION Atorvastatin recommend current NICE guideline lipid modification ; 20mg recommend dose primary prevention cardiovascular disease . Atorvastatin also recommend NICE secondary prevention2 patient high risk adverse event ( patient population ) , dose low 80mg recommend . The commonly use dose 20mg . A visually match placebo choose appropriate comparator two reason . Firstly , patient expectation symptom statins likely affect experience symptom . A placebo control minimise bias arise knowledge allocation . Secondly , withhold statin treatment patient placebo treatment period justify trial recruit patient recently stop use statin ( therefore currently receive benefit statin ) wish discontinue . If patient trial tolerate active treatment period symptom , trial likely increase usage statins long term . 2.9.2 DRUG MANUFACTURE , BLINDING AND SUPPLY OF TRIAL MEDICATION The active trial drug atorvastatin ( atorvastatin calcium trihydrate ) purchase open market . Placebo manufacture specially match atorvastatin GMP certify manufacturer . Capsules package identical appearance active treatment placebo . DBcaps® capsule unique lock mechanism help assure integrity blind use encapsulation active placebo treatment . Additionally , patient ask swallow capsule whole without chew breaking . The blinding process first stage Qualified Person ( QP ) release do designate clinical trial supply company . The blinding process involve encapsulate active tablet , complete removal original manufacturer 's label replacement clinical trial label bear randomisation number use pack identification . Other pack label text identical atorvastatin placebo treatment compliance requirement investigational medicinal product . 2.9.3 ADMINISTRATION OF TRIAL MEDICATION Patients receive allocate trial medication post ask take study medication daily six two-month treatment period . Ideally break treatment period . However , reason break , patient simply restart take trial medication soon possible . Patients ask take one capsule orally daily time day convenient . Capsules swallow whole . Patients give write instruction take study medication . At start two-month treatment period , patient ask inform trial team first date study medication use use trial 's mobile application ( app ) , email , text message , Freephone telephone service pre-paid postage reply slip - whichever easy ensure data collection occur correct day . A Freephone telephone number provide patient call question . Adherence study medication collect day data part outcome data collection . 2.10 DATA COLLECTION This trial coordinate CTU LSHTM conduct GP practice England Wales .

The Research Nurse patient arrange telephone face-to-face appointment discus individual result month 14 . The Research Nurse also inform patient want continue take statin without break , arrange separate clinical appointment GP prior end treatment period . At month 15 , trial staff email/telephone patient document decision future statin use whether result help reach decision . This last data collection point trial . Throughout trial , continue patient care discretion GP . In primary care , patient record ongoing statin prescription . Where treatment interact drug need less one-month duration , patient ask stop trial treatment period . Where treatment interact drug need longer one month , patient ask withdraw study treatment completely . When patient randomise , temporary Read code indicate StatinWISE participation record primary care record , code remove end trial . Patients also give alert card identifies StatinWISE patient . Patients ask present card anyone provide medical care outside usual general practice . This card link trial website trial contact number . 3 . OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome : The primary outcome self-reported 'muscle symptom ' , define pain , weakness , tenderness , stiffness cramp body intensity , record participant believe associate study medication ; symptom commonly report patient often reason discontinuation . The primary outcome assess mean difference VAS score ( range 0 100 ) treatment period trial treatment treatment period placebo , estimate via linear mixed model . Secondary outcome : Secondary outcome relate participant belief cause muscle symptom , site muscle symptom , muscle symptom affect participant information symptom collect last day two-month treatment period , use questionnaire ( Appendix 5 ) . The secondary outcome adherence medication , participant 's decision statin treatment follow trial , whether find trial result helpful . Specifically , secondary outcome : The proportion patient muscle symptom two-month period report believe symptom cause study medication , compare period IMP treatment placebo . Site muscle symptom ( single multiple ; head neck/upper limbs/lower limbs/trunk ) . Among patient report muscle symptom , difference mean VAS score ( range 0 100 ) following , compare period IMP treatment placebo : General activity Mood Walking ability Normal work ( include work outside home housework ) Relations people Sleep Enjoyment life Other symptoms patient believe attribute study medication ( group : musculoskeletal ; gastrointestinal ; respiratory ; neurological ; psychological ; ) . Adherence study medication assess : ( ) self-report ( b ) counting pill remain return package , relationship adherence muscle symptom . Participant decision regard future statin use relationship primary outcome . Whether patient find trial result helpful make decision future statin use . 4 . ANALYSIS Individual N-of-1 trial : The purpose analyse inform individual patient effect IMP VAS muscle symptom score . The analysis presentation individual level result develop collaboration Patient Public Involvement ( PPI ) group . The investigator examine range graphical summary statistical analysis order identify informative presentation individual result . As result process , end individual trial participant show numerical graphical summary individual data , relation IMP placebo period . Combined analysis N-of-1 trial Primary analysis : To estimate population average estimate trial treatment n VAS muscle symptom score , data N-of-1 trial aggregate form powerful dataset . The investigator adopt intention-to-treat approach . Patients enter data muscle symptom least treatment period IMP least treatment period placebo include primary analysis . The primary analysis linear mixed model VAS muscle symptom score random effect participant treatment fixed period effect . Residual error model use first-order auto-regressive error structure within treatment period account correlation 7 daily measurement , robust standard error account non-normality VAS score . Although VAS muscle symptom score unlikely exactly normally distribute , analyse data use normal-based method likely sufficiently robust approach . All test two-sided . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Secondary analysis : Secondary outcome relate impact IMP aspects life analyse similar manner primary outcome , omit auto-regressive correlation structure since secondary outcome measure per treatment period . The investigator investigate whether excess muscle symptom , , experience treatment period IMP appear concentrated multiple site . Descriptive statistic use summarise measure adherence randomise treatment , relationship IMP placebo period . The investigator use measure adherence randomise treatment perform efficacy analysis base around instrumental variable approach . Because analyse require much strong assumption intention-to-treat analysis , result efficacy analysis present interpreted secondary analysis . The secondary outcome include single binary measure whether participant report muscle symptom treatment period . This combined follow-up question pertain attribution , obtain single binary measure whether participant report muscle symptom attribute study medication . These two binary outcome measure assess use logistic mixed model random participant treatment effect fix period effect . The investigator relate patient ' decision regard future statin use , whether participant find result helpful make subsequent treatment decision , individual estimate effect IMP . Subgroup analyse : There priori subgroup analysis plan . If overall population-level effect detect , investigator may investigate whether effect varies within subgroup define measured baseline characteristic . These analysis regard interpreted exploratory .</detailed_description>
