	<brief_summary>This sample-collection study open participant several category : healthy volunteer ( without family history pancreatic cancer ) individual diagnose pancreatitis stage pancreatic cancer . All participant submit urine , saliva blood sample ; pancreatitis pancreatic cancer patient also submit tissue sample biopsy/ies surgery part care provide doctor . In partnership Berg Health , LLC , biomarkers investigate potential use early detection pancreatic cancer , determine prognosis patient , find appropriate treatment patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Primary Objective study identify validate biomarkers use early detection selection personalize treatment pancreatic disease , include adenocarcinoma pancreatitis . A maximum 600 subject enrol study , include healthy volunteer , subject acute chronic pancreatitis , family member risk pancreatic cancer ( define ) , subject stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma contribute sample annotate longitudinal clinical data . Biomarkers investigate potential Theranostic , Prognostic , Diagnostic Therapeutic indicator among subject pancreatitis pancreatic cancer . Examples eligible participant include : - Healthy volunteer without know pancreatic disease ( 50 subject ) - Healthy volunteer know benign malignant pancreatic disease , AND one first-degree relative pancreatic cancer , OR two second-degree relative pancreatic cancer . These subject also include undergone surgery suspect pancreatic cancer , find non-pancreatic cancer pathology upon final local site central pathology review . ( 100 subject ) . - Subjects diagnose acute chronic pancreatitis ( 50 subject ) . - Subjects diagnose early stage pancreatic cancer undergo surgery standard care therapy without preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy ; subject diagnose borderline pancreatic cancer , subject diagnose locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( 200 subject ) . Enrollment treatment naïve subject early stage pancreatic cancer prefer . - Subjects diagnose metastatic pancreatic cancer treat standard care therapy , gemcitabine/Abraxane FOLFIRINOX front-line treatment without associate radiation treatment ( 200 subject ) . Enrollment treatment naïve subject metastatic pancreatic cancer prefer . Consented enrolled subject ask participate study follow way : - Subjects ask contribute blood ( serum , buffy coat , plasma ) , urine , saliva enrollment , clinically-significant timepoints throughout treatment indicated disease state . - Subjects undergoing surgery pancreatic disease also ask donate diseased adjacent non-diseased pancreatic tissue , define `` excess '' tissue diagnostic therapeutic biopsy surgical procedure longer require standard care purpose . - Examples `` excess '' tissue standard care surgical procedure include any/all biopsy resection perform may include non-diseased pancreatic tissue pancreatic tumor tissue . - These collection procedure alter prolong conduct standard care surgical procedure . Subsequent liquid non-tissue sample collect subject follow clinically-relevant time point related standard care treatment pancreatic disease : - Before , time , and/or surgery remove pancreatic tumor inflammatory mass ; - chemotherapy and/or radiation cancer ; - upon local , regional , distant progression cancer ; - resolution disease process . Blood ( serum , plasma , buffy coat ) , urine saliva collect six ( 6 ) time 12 month period per subject . Samples collect subject withdraws study complete enrollment .</detailed_description>
