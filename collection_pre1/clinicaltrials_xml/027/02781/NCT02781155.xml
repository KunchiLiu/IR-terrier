Blood count therefore monitor . If fall low , dose chemotherapy may reduce time dos extend . This may affect survival well quality life . Research study China West suggest moxibustion apply practitioner improve blood count immunity , reduce side effect chemotherapy . Moxibustion ( also call moxa ) form traditional Chinese medicine use heat stimulate acupuncture point . This heat come smoulder herb call mugwort , roll cigar shape gently warm point . Many patient regard pleasant , relax experience . The researcher teach patient self-administer moxa acupuncture point knee . This feasibility study see patient willing able self-administer moxa daily throughout chemotherapy . Patients keep moxa diary record activity . The researcher also use questionnaire ass whether patient see active manager health . This may help researcher screen suitable patient future study . The researcher also monitor blood count , delay dose reduction chemotherapy , chemotherapy side effect . Participants complete quality life questionnaires interval chemotherapy . If result favourable , use design randomise control trial compare daily moxibustion `` treatment '' control arm .</detailed_description>
