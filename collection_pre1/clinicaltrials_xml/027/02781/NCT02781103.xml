	<brief_title>Guided Imagery Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Women With Chronic Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pelvic pain ( CPP ) common often debilitate problem among woman . It occur umbilicus severe enough cause functional impairment require treatment . One challenge treat woman CPP single cause often lack . CPP present syndrome symptom involve gynecologic , gastrointestinal , urologic , musculoskeletal symptom well psychosocial condition depression negatively impact quality life . The study consist one screen visit may divide two visit need accommodate subject 's schedule . The screen visit ( ) take place within four week prior start intervention schedule . The following complete screen visit ( ) : pelvic/levator exam , body mass index ( BMI ) , last menstrual period , medication use , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , questionnaire ( CAGE-AID Questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Interstitial Cystitis Symptom/Problem Index , Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 item scale , McGill Pain Questionnaire , Pain Catastrophizing Scale , Visual Analog Scale pain ) . The subject complete 16 intervention visit 12 week . The study intervention visit conduct Beaumont Hospital- Royal Oak campus license nurse and/or physician . The initial 10 session occur Monday Friday , within 21-day period ( allow miss day due unexpected emergency and/or inclement weather ) . Excluding weekend , 2 day intervention session . Each intervention 20 minute duration . After complete initial 10 session , subject complete additional 6 weekly maintenance session accord treatment group . Objectives : 1 . To assess change EEG alpha brain wave woman CPP guide imagery session tDCS actual sham treatment . 2 . To assess change pain , urinary symptom , quality life woman guide imagery session tDCS actual sham session . Endpoints : Primary objective/endpoint : Change alpha wave frequency EEG 10 session tDCS guide imagery , versus 10 session sham tDCS guide imagery compare baseline . Secondary objective/endpoint : Change pain level ( 0-10 ) Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) 10 intervention session end study compare baseline . Hypothesis : The combination tDCS Guided Imagery ( GI ) enhance patient outcome , evidence difference alpha brain wave change , pain quality life ( QOL ) measure tDCS actual sham treatment group .</detailed_description>
