	<brief_summary>Motor imagery training facilitate neural plasticity increase neuronal cortical pathway brain . Motor imagery training effective way stroke survivor . However , effect person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) know . Additionally , telerehabilitation base motor imagery training rare treatment way require research . Therefore , study aim investigate effect telerehabilitation base motor imagery training gait balance performance person MS . The participant allocate three group , include motor imagery training , wait-list control group , age , gender , education match healthy control group . Each group include least 25 participant ( i.e . total 75 participant ) . All assessment perform train 6-week motor imagery training group . The participant wait-list control group underwent assessment 6-week interval . The healthy participant assess one . The motor imagery training design individual basis follow standard protocol . It apply three time week 6 week . The first three session perform clinic , perform patient ' home telerehabilitation technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , inflammatory , demyelinate disease central nervous system . It common neurological disease cause progressive gait balance disorder young adult . The previous study indicate home care treatment service , accelerate heal process make one feel well , preferred patient . Persons MS commonly able access institutional rehabilitation service disability and/or home location . It restrict participation person MS treatment benefit . In recent year , telerehabilitation program increase overcome problem . Motor imagery training also stand good option rehabilitation program . Motor imagery mental process individual rehearse simulates give action . Motor imagery training facilitate neural plasticity increase neuronal cortical pathway brain . Motor imagery training effective way stroke survivor . However , effect person MS know . Additionally , telerehabilitation base motor imagery training rare treatment way require research . The aim study investigate effect telerehabilitation base motor imagery training gait balance performance person MS . The participant allocate three group , include motor imagery training , wait-list control group , age , gender , education match healthy control group . Each group include least 25 participant ( i.e . total 75 participant ) . The person MS recruit outpatient MS clinic Dokuz Eylul University , healthy participant recruit stuff Dokuz Eylul University . The inclusion exclusion criterion assessment neurological examination perform blinded neurologist specialize MS . The cognition , fatigue , depression , quality life assessment perform blinded neuropsychologist . The remain assessment , include walking , balance , motor imagery ability assess blinded physiotherapist . All assessment perform train 6-week motor imagery training group . The participant wait-list control group underwent assessment 6-week interval . The healthy participant assess one . The motor imagery training design individual basis follow standard protocol . It apply three time week 6 week . The first three session perform clinic , perform patient ' home telerehabilitation technique .</detailed_description>
