	<detailed_description>Previous study show histological change gastric mucosa obese non-obese individual exist , mainly cell produce hormone ghrelin , also gut hormone . Understanding histological difference ( obese non-obese individual ) might elucidate obesity pathophysiology , however , data scarce even contradictory . Even less known histological characteristic duodenal mucosa obesity lean state , several study already perform hint differences.. In conclusion , investigator assume obese non-obese individual may gastric and/or duodenal histological difference . These difference might influence gut hormone composition function play crucial role development obesity metabolic syndrome . To best knowledge , in-vivo , human , real-time cellular level comparison gastric duodenal mucosa well differences microbiome stomach duodenum obese non-obese individual never do . This accomplished pCLE . pCLE , composed miniature microscope assemble tip optical fiber . This optic fiber insert work channel standard endoscope , bring microscope tip fiber close proximity tissue . The system apply blue-light laser stain fluorescein ( IV 2.5 ml , 10 % fluorescein , ) provide cellular-level , in-vivo , real time image : concept call `` optical biopsy '' . The system use auxiliary tool GI-endoscopy recent year . This technology show useful identify objective histological feature even intramucosal bacteria different tissue .</detailed_description>
