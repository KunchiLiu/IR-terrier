	<brief_summary>From Weill Cornell Medical College Center Sleep Medicine , investigator recruit patient ( N = 25 ) previously document moderate severe OSA . They receive all-night in-home sleep study document severity OSA immediately start train regimen . Scales questionnaires measure sleepiness , snore , fatigue , insomnia administer prior start train repeat six week train . Subjects may remove study due fail adhere train regimen anytime via remote data monitoring . The principal measure efficacy treatment change RDI , number abnormal breathe event per hour sleep .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tongue Protrusion Force : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) condition characterize temporary diminution cessation breathe cause repetitive collapse upper airway ( UA ) sleep ( 1 ) . OSA common disorder associate abnormality pharyngeal anatomy physiology muscle airway , normally relax sleep , fail provide sufficient dilatory force balance contractive force inspiratory activity ( 2 ) . This force imbalance serve either partially completely collapse UA , thereby prevent sufficient air reach lung . These pause breathe lead blood oxygen desaturation induce neurological arousal result sleep disruption fragmentation . The cycle airway collapse arousal repeat hundred time per night ( 1 ) . According National Sleep Foundation , OSA affect 18-22 million Americans , 80 % undiagnosed . OSA prevalent among overweight old individual reduce muscle tone , skeletal anomaly micrognathia retrognathia , airway crowd redundant enlarge soft tissue structure . OSA associate significant physiological psychological problem . OSA result excessive daytime sleepiness , fatigue , memory impairment , reduce reaction time , increase risk motor vehicle ( 3 ) workplace ( 4 ) accident . In addition , OSA sufferers face increase cardiovascular risk include hypertension , heart disease , stroke ( 5 ) . OSA even recently link increased cancer incidence ( 6 ) mortality ( 7 ) , presumably hypoxia-induced angiogenesis . On morning December 1 , 2013 , Metro-North passenger train derail Bronx . The accident kill 4 passenger , injure 61 , cause $ 9 million worth damage . Investigators determine human error blame : train engineer admit reach curve `` go daze , '' allow train travel three time post speed limit ( 8 ) . A medical examination conduct accident diagnose train engineer OSA , hamper ability fully adjust sleep pattern morning shift begin work two week prior accident ( 9 ) . The Harvard Medical School release report 2010 entitle , `` The Price Fatigue : The Surprising Economic Costs Unmanaged Sleep Apnea , '' estimate annual economic cost moderate severe OSA United States $ 65-165B ( compare $ 60B drunk drive $ 150B wear seatbelt ) , include $ 10-40B OSA-related traffic accident $ 5-20B OSA-related workplace accident ( 10 ) . Existing treatment OSA include lifestyle modification ( 11 ) weight loss , position restriction , avoidance muscle relaxant alcohol benzodiazepine drug . Oral appliance include mandibular advancement device tongue retain device increasingly employ . OSA also treat surgery , include tonsillectomy uvulopalatopharyngeoplasty ( UPPP ) reduce tissue crowd UA lumen , genioglossal advancement , maxillomandibular advancement . The widespread generally effective treatment OSA , however , remain use various device maintain positive airway pressure ( PAP ) Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) , BiLevel Positive Airway Pressure ( BiPAP ) , Autotitrating ( AutoPAP ) device . CPAP related treatment costly cumbersome . 40-60 % patient prescribe CPAP fail adhere treatment ( 12 ; 13 ; 14 ) . Patients cite comfort lifestyle factor ( sensation claustrophobia , dry mouth , ill-fitting mask , lack portability system preclude use travel ) reason abandon treatment ( 15 ; 16 ) . Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ( BPH ) , accompany nocturia , also associate noncompliance CPAP among old men ( 17 ) . Poor compliance CPAP prompt search alternative form treatment OSA . The Genioglossus ( GG ) , make body tongue , major muscle responsible protrude tongue major UA dilator oppose collapse force pharynx upon inspiration . Reduced UA dilator force sleep posit contribute collapse pharynx OSA ( Schwartz 2001 ) . A number control study demonstrate strengthen GG result clinically significant reduction OSA severity . In randomized control trial ( RCT ) OSA patient ( 18 ) , group perform oropharyngeal exercise 30 minute day three month reduce average apnea hypopnea index ( AHI , number apnea hypopnea event per hour sleep ) almost 35 % ( 22.4 14.7 , P &lt; 0.05 ) . The exercise consist isometric isotonic exercise involve tongue . Another RCT ( 19 ) design increase UA dilator muscle strength demonstrate playing didgeridoo ( aboriginal wind instrument ) six time per week average 25 minute per day four month decrease average AHI almost 50 % ( 22.3 11.6 , P &lt; 0.01 ) . Electrical stimulation hypoglossal nerve ( innervate GG ) also promote UA patency sleep . Hypoglossal stimulation reduce UA resistance healthy person subject OSA reduce AHI OSA subject 50 % ( 20 ) . II . Aims The investigator assert train GG muscle awake serve dilate pharyngeal pathway - restriction result obstructive apnea - sleep . If confirm , investigator develop effective behavioral treatment OSA . The investigator anticipate attractive alternative OSA patient unable acclimate CPAP adhere use comfort lifestyle reason . This IRB approve clinical study design determine effective training regimen increase GG muscle strength well obtain preliminary data effect tongue protrusive force training ( TPFT ) OSA . In study , investigator use subject moderate severe OSA . OSA severity assess sleep study conduct prior begin train regimen . After six week daily train , OSA severity measure follow-up sleep study .</detailed_description>
