	<brief_summary>This study find high acceptable treatment dose cord blood , culture expand natural killer ( NK ) cell , kind immune cell , patient relapse and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia . The NK cell give chemotherapy Recombinant human interleukin 2 ( rhIL-2 ) help NK cell expand body . The safety treatment study researcher want learn NK cell help treat AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study Human Cord Blood Derived , Culture Expanded Natural Killer Cell ( PNK-007 ) Infusion With Subcutaneous Recombinant Human IL-2 ( rhIL-2 ) Adults With Relapsed and/or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study ass safety determine maximum tolerate dose PNK-007 subject relapse and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . The secondary objective explore potential clinical efficacy day 42 . Treatment plan include condition cyclophosphamide fludarabine . PNK-007 administered IV follow total six Recombinant human interleukin 2 ( rhIL-2 ) injection support NK cell body . Subjects follow 24 month .</detailed_description>
