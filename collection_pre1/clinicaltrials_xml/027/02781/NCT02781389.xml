	<brief_title>Vismodegib Locally Advanced Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma Under Real World Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center non-interventional study approximately 50 patient locally advance BCC start Vismodegib ( receive least one dose ) Q4 2015 . Duration recruitment one year . Patients follow prospectively disease progression , death , 3 year first dose Vismodegib ( whichever occurs first ) . In addition 50 laBCC patient approximately 3 patient mBCC document include follow symptom ( pain , fatigue , disturbed sleep , lack appetite , nausea/vomiting , shortness breath , disturb remembering , dry mouth cough ) . The primary effectiveness objective study follow : • To evaluate duration response define duration first document response complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) disease progression ( determined treat physician , might include categorize follow group : clinical assessment , histological assessment , image assessment ) laBCC patient . The secondary effectiveness objective study follow : - Objective response rate ( rate patient CR PR ) ( determine treat physician , might include categorize follow group : clinical assessment , histological assessment , image assessment ) - Disease control rate ( complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) ) - Recurrence rate : rate patient respond ( CR PR ) later progress - Time progression : time first treatment progression - Time death : time first treatment death - Time response : time first treatment response The explorative objective study evaluate follow endpoint : - Type tumor response evaluation ( determined treat physician , might include categorize follow group : clinical assessment , histological assessment , image assessment ) - Treatment decision therapy Vismodegib ( tumor board OR decision otorhinolaryngologist , surgeon , plastic surgeon , dermato-oncologist , radiotherapist , ophthalmologist ) - Utilization - Previous treatment BCC lesion , lead therapy Vismodegib - BCC therapy Vismodegib therapy ( applicable ) - Treatment duration Vismodegib ( start stop date therapy Vismodegib ) - Assessment duration time point treatment interruption Vismodegib - Reason treatment discontinuation - mBCC patient separately evaluate accord primary secondary effectiveness objective describe laBCC</detailed_description>
