	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) highly prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder . The effective treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . CPAP therapy show significantly reduce subjective sleepiness blood pressure patient symptomatic OSA . Its effectiveness tend depend nightly usage commonly hold view CPAP use least 4h/night . However , previous study estimate considerable proportion CPAP user fail achieve . In addition , inadequate evidence support apparent threshold effect unclear whether patient actually benefit treatment whether could withdraw CPAP , thus substantially reduce health care cost , encourage increase nightly usage CPAP . The aim propose project study effect CPAP withdrawal subjective sleepiness OSA patient use CPAP le 4h/night average . We hypothesize two-week CPAP withdrawal patient 3-4h/night use lead return OSA-related symptom . This trial well establish minimum level CPAP adherence could generally regard effective reduce OSA-related symptom .</brief_summary>
