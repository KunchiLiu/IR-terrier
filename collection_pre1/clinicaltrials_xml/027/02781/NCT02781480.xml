	<brief_summary>The inherited retinal dystrophy clinically genetically heterogeneous group condition , often present childhood.Inherited retinal degeneration cause sight impairment approximately 1 3000 people Western world . There currently effective treatment . Leber congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) severe , early-onset form inherit retinal degeneration involve rod cone photoreceptors . LCA cause mutation one least 19 different genes.Mutations RPE65 , express retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) , responsible 3 16 % people affect . The RPE65 gene encode 65-kDa retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) -specific protein require conversion vitamin A 11-cis-retinal RPE essential regeneration rod visual pigment Proof principle study RPE65 gene replacement therapy demonstrate use recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 ( rAAV2/2 ) vector animal model . Furthermore clinical trial gene replacement therapy RPE65 associate LCA ( RPE65-LCA ) show significant promise . All three clinical trial show improvement visual function first year , however long term follow Proof principle study RPE65 gene replacement therapy demonstrate use recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 ( rAAV2/2 ) vector animal model . Furthermore clinical trial gene replacement therapy RPE65 associate LCA ( RPE65-LCA ) show significant promise . All three clinical trial show improvement visual function first year , however long term follow demonstrate progressive visual loss initial improvement maintain . Greater efficacy note animal model . The relatively low efficacy treatment participant likely due insufficient production RPE65 protein AAV2/2 hRPE65 human eye . Having identify maximal tolerate AAV2/2 vector dose previous clinical trial , optimize therapeutic vector drive efficient transgene expression increase availability RPE65 affect human develop . The aim trial determine safety new optimise AAV2/5 vector human explore potential efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial take place across 2 site ( Moorfields Eye Hospital UK University Michigan Kellogg Eye Centre US ) . Up 27 patient recruit . The trial involve dose escalation phase , 18 adult participant administer one 3 different dos ( low , intermediate high ) use 3+3 design . Dose escalation undertaken adult , base escalation rule around dose-limiting event ( DLEs ) . Up 9 child age 3 include acceptable safety profile establish adult . Review safety data undertaken IDMC prior dose escalation . The trial involve 13 visit occur approximate 9 12 month period . Delivery vector subretinal space perform follow standard surgical vitrectomy . Subjects ask consider enrol onto separate long-term follow-up study continue monitor safety intervention study end , period 5 year . Assessments undertaken depend age , co-operation ability undertake test include ( see schedule assessment ) : - Medical history , ocular examination , visual acuity testing , contrast sensitivity , read speed , colour fundus photography , fundus autofluorescence , SDOCT imaging , adaptive optic image , mesopic scotopic microperimetry - Electrophysiological assessment incorporate protocol recommend International Society Clinical Electrophysiology Vision ( ISCEV ) . Full-field electroretinogram ( FFERG ) - measure global retinal function - undertaken previously document undetectable - majority patient undetectable FFERG . Pattern ERG ( PERG ) multifocal ERG ( mfERG ) undertaken annual basis determine change central retinal function time ( often residual central function till late disease ) - repeat find undetectable . - Visual Field Testing . The Octopus 900 perimeter use . Static full-field test undertaken employ GATE strategy , size V test target . Further analysis undertaken model entire hill-of-vision enhance information obtain full-field static perimetry . - Vision guide mobility . This assess measure ability subject navigate simple route range control illuminance . - QoL questionnaire ( IVI_A , IVI_C EQ5D-5L ) - Blood test confirm mutation within RPE65 gene , bio distribution vector evaluation immune response , biochemistry haematology .</detailed_description>
