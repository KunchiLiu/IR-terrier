	<brief_summary>World Health Organization ( WHO ) define body mass index ( BMI ) ratio weight kilogram square height meter ( kg/m2 ) . BMI use widely diagnose obesity simple method carry also inexpensive . According WHO , 1.9 billion overweight individual 2014 age 18 year old . Of 1.9 billion overweight individual , 600 million obese adult . The prevalence cardiovascular disease high among overweight obese individual compare individual normal body mass index . This probably due alter cardiovascular autonomic regulation . The risk get cardiovascular disease also higher among physically inactive individual . As much 60 % American adult regularly active 25 % active . Obese overweight individual tend physically inactive show negative relationship BMI heart rate recovery ( HRR ) . HRR define difference heart rate maximum exercise 1 minute later recovery period stop exercise . HRR exercise stress due withdrawal sympathetic nervous system reactivation parasympathetic nervous system . Parasympathetic nervous system alter obese individual therefore lead poor HRR exercise . Aerobic train reduce body composition also improve autonomic cardiovascular control . There limited literature support study show potential 4 week aerobic train influence heart rate recovery sedentary healthy adult . Most study conduct use minimum 6 8 week aerobic training . The potential 4 week aerobic train improve autonomic nervous system among sedentary adult still unclear . Therefore , hypothesize study effect 4 week aerobic train vagal modulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity complex health issue result various cause contribute factor . Individual factor like genetics behavior may contribute overweight obesity . Genetics play important role increase hunger food intake individual . A examples common disease related obesity type-2 diabetes , stroke , coronary heart disease type cancer . All obesity relate disease may fully reversible even weight loss . Body mass index ( BMI ) use widely screen tool ass overweight obesity . Based World Health Organization ( WHO ) international classification BMI , individual consider obese BMI value equal 30 kg/m2 high overweight BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2 . A study conduct USA find prevalence obesity among child adult . Researchers attempt predict childhood obesity analyse obesity trend among adult United States . The result study show prevalence obesity among child 16.9 % adult 34.9 % . There obvious change prevalence obesity among child adult 2003-2012 United States ( 1 ) . It deny link increase rate obesity increase medical spending . Medical spending obese individual 42 % high compare normal body weight ( 2 ) . The researcher report study obesity one factor become economic burden public private payer . South East Asia Western Pacific country suffer disease associate obesity cardiovascular disease diabetes . Malaysia country high rate obesity South East Asia ( 3 ) . Studies show autonomic nervous system associate obesity . In 2001 , study conduct identify effect weight loss autonomic nervous system . The finding show activity parasympathetic nervous system increase weight loss cardiac vagal tone improve significantly weight loss ( 4 ) . Cardiac vagal tone control mainly parasympathetic nervous system help improve heart rate recovery ( HRR ) . There two phase heart rate recovery , fast slow phase . The fast phase due cardiac parasympathetic reactivation slow phase cardiac sympathetic withdrawal . If disturbance autonomic nervous system HRR slow ( 5 ) . Therefore , HRR use assess cardiac autonomic function marker cardiac vagal tone . Abnormal heart rate recovery exercise stress consider dysfunction autonomic nervous system . It suggest several study heart rate recovery exercise stress slower among obese individual compare BMI individual . A study conduct identify relationship heart rate recovery body mass index . The finding show negative association heart rate recovery body mass index . 3.5 % 2443 individual present delayed decrease heart rate recovery . The prevalence decrease heart rate recovery high among overweight obese group ( 6 ) . In another study similar finding observe . Researchers conclude obese individual likely impaired heart rate recovery recovery phase exercise ( 7 ) . Aerobic train improves autonomic cardiovascular control . A study 4 week aerobic train do identify effect cardiac vagal tone . Authors report 4 week treadmill aerobic training able improve autonomic nervous system among pre-hypertension individual ( 8 ) . The aerobic training consist 30 minute treadmill exercise 65 % maximum oxygen consumption . Another study show similar result autonomic nervous system improve 6 month moderate intensity aerobic training ( 9 ) . The aerobic training carry 1 hour session 2 session one week 6 month . The present systematic review show aerobic train proven effective increase heart rate recovery among subject establish heart disease ( 10 ) . The effect 4 week aerobic train improve cardiac vagal tone among sedentary healthy adult still unclear . Therefore , aim study effect 4 week aerobic train vagal modulation .</detailed_description>
