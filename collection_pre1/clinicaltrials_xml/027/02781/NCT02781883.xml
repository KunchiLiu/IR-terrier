	<brief_summary>The primary objective study ass whether combination BP1001 LDAC provide great efficacy ( Complete Remission [ CR ] , Complete Remission incomplete hematologic recovery [ CRi ] , Complete Remission incomplete platelet recovery [ CRp ] ) LDAC alone ( historical comparison ) participant AML elect treat intensive chemotherapy . Safety , pharmacokinetics , overall survival , time response , duration response also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial BP1001 ( Liposomal Grb2 Antisense Oligonucleotide ) Combination With LDAC Patients With Previously Untreated AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Grb2 gene map human chromosome region 17q22-qter , region duplicate leukemias solid tumor , may result increase copy number Grb2 gene product . As Grb2 important transformation murine hematopoietic cell , proliferation human leukemia cell express high level oncogenic tyrosine kinase , inhibition Grb2 may significant impact natural history leukemia . The study drug ( BP1001 ) may able inhibit cell make Grb-2 . Researchers hope without protein , leukemia cell die . Low-dose cytarabine ( Ara-C ) ( LDAC ) use variety schedule several Phase II trial AML show response include complete remission disease . It generally well tolerate give outpatient home care set . Researchers hope combination BP1001 LDAC result great response rate duration response participant AML elect treat intensive chemotherapy . This Phase IIa , multicenter , study BP1001 combination LDAC participants previously untreated AML otherwise eligible standard high-intensity chemotherapy regimen elect low-intensity regimen . This trial utilize single arm , open label , two-stage design ass safety profile , PK , PD , efficacy 60 mg/m2 BP1001 combination LDAC compare historical response rate document LDAC alone . Approximately 54 evaluable participant receive combination BP1001 LDAC .</detailed_description>
