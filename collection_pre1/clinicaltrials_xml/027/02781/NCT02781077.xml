	<detailed_description>Community reintegration often significantly affected majority stroke individual . To fulfill requirement proper home exercise program walking rehabilitation stroke victim , investigator structure task-oriented exercise program minimal supervision . This exercise program structure challenge walking-related activity base motor learn principle Gentile 's progression motor task . The strengthen balance component , aerobic condition walk adaptability compose exercise program optimize walk ability . There sixty minute last ten exercise three progression step exercise program . For train effect occur , step exercise program design increase demand intensity range moderate vigorous . To confirm progressive energy demand , purpose study investigate intensity demand three step task- orient home exercise program walking competency individual post stroke .</detailed_description>
