	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer worldwide . Incidence mortality reach plateau appear drop United States part Western Europe . This decline attribute several factor early detection use screen mammography appropriate use systemic adjuvant therapy . Breast cancer disease predominantly influence risk factor allocate one four group : first , family history / genetic account 15 % breast cancer case . The second group know risk factor breast cancer link hazardous effect hormonal exposure early age menarche , late age menopause , small number child nulliparity , late age first birth little breast feeding . Long term use hormone replacement therapy apparently long term use oral contraceptive also important . The third group high mammographic breast density show one significant marker breast cancer risk fourth group history proliferative benign breast disease . Recently , belief overall caloric intake obesity particular weight gain relate increase breast cancer risk different effect pre post menopausal woman . Also physical activity appear important , beyond effect weight . There scattered study breast cancer risk factor Arab region . One study publish March 2002 investigate risk factor associate breast cancer Jordanian woman study associate diet breast cancer . The known / well-established risk factor Western country bee systematically validate proven play role Arab woman breast cancer . Therefore , know risk assessment tool applicable patient population . No model create yet synthesize breast cancer risk factor Arab woman . Research Impact : This study great impact influence medical setting target model derive study pioneer region . This model beneficial identifying risk factor association Arab woman population . Furthermore , bring chemotherapy prevention risk factor model establish . Risk factor maybe different identify western woman Gail IBIS Models</detailed_description>
