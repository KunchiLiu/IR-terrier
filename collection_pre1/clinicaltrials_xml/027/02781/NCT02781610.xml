	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , life-shortening genetic disease , mark acute episode symptom lung infection increase lung function decrease . These pulmonary exacerbation treat vary antibiotic vary time period base need determine individual patient , family , health care provider . Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guideline treatment pulmonary exacerbation publish Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ( CFF ) 2009 provide recommendation treatment also identify key question additional study need . A strong desire among clinician reduce treatment duration ( reduce cost , inconvenience , potential toxicity ) conflict belief patient respond robustly treatment might benefit extend treatment . This randomize , control , open-label study design evaluate efficacy safety differ duration IV treatment , give hospital home pulmonary exacerbation adult patient CF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study assess non-inferiority 10 day versus 14 day treatment duration among patient early robust improvement ( ERR subject ) superiority 21 day versus 14 day treatment duration among subject meet definition ERR ( non-ERR ; NERR ) . Subjects undergo pulmonary function test ( spirometry ) complete respiratory symptom score [ Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score ( CRISS ) ] initiation IV treatment ( Baseline/ Visit 1 ) Day 7-10 ( Visit 2 ) . At Visit 2 , subject allocate group ERR NERR base initial clinical response determine change force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ; percent predict ) CRISS Baseline randomize IV treatment duration ( nest within group ) . ERR subject [ ≥8 % predict improvement FEV1 Visit 1 Visit 2 CRISS reduction ≥11 point Visit 1 Visit 2 ] randomize 1:1 either 10 day 14 day total IV antibiotic treatment duration . Remaining ( NERR ) subject randomized 1:1 receive either 14 21 day total IV antibiotic treatment duration . All subject evaluate Visit 3 , 14 day follow scheduled completion IV antibiotic treatment .</detailed_description>
