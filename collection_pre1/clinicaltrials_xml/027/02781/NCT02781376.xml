	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) prevalent child adolescent associate variety negative consequence affect health cognitive functioning . While clinical guideline outline effective strategy diagnosis management pediatric OSA , rate screen , identification , management primary care setting remain low . The aim current study evaluate use computer decision support system module ( CHICA-OSA ) design improve adherence OSA guideline pediatric primary care clinic . All child age 1-11 year screen snore symptom OSA wait room prior visit primary care provider ( PCP ) . In clinic randomly assign CHICA-OSA , caregiver snore child report additional OSA symptom , PCPs receive automate prompt electronic health record ( EHR ) provide evidence-based evaluation appropriate referral testing . For child send polysomnography ( PSG ) , PCPs receive automate prompt reassess symptom next visit . We hypothesize clinic use CHICA-OSA good adherence guideline , evidence high rate identify OSAS , referral PSG , re-assessment follow treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This study use cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) two-year period four pediatric community clinic affiliated institution . To minimize contamination , randomization occur clinic , individual patient unit analysis . Four clinic already match pair facilitate balance patient number demographic , coin flip determine clinic pair receive CHICA-OSA serve control clinic . The two control clinic also CHICA system place intervention pertain sleep simple module identifies snore child . While receive automate prompt help identify snore child , PCPs control clinic evaluate manage OSA use standard method ( i.e. , treatment-as-usual ) . Participants : Participants include child age 1 11 year present PCP one four pediatric community clinic locate Indianapolis , Indiana . CHICA System : CHICA comprise : ( 1 ) knowledge base pediatric guideline rule ; ( 2 ) repository patient data ; ( 3 ) tablet user interface ; ( 4 ) interface exist electronic medical record system . The result system deliver `` just-in-time '' patient-relevant guideline PCPs clinical encounter capture accurate structure data interact . In wait room caregiver complete prescreening form ( PSF ) , available English Spanish , consist series twenty surveillance question tailor child 's age past history . A positive response question may trigger additional follow-up question . During clinic visit , relevant feedback caregiver responses information clinical guideline display prominently provider worksheet ( PWS ) electronic health record . Visit 1 . While wait room , caregiver eligible child respond item PSF follow : `` Does child consistently snore 3 night per week ? '' For caregiver CHICA-OSA clinic , `` yes '' response trigger additional question sign symptom OSA . Specific item correspond symptom take Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire ( PSQ19 ) include observed apnea , snort , gasp , daytime sleepiness , sign symptom list AAP guideline paper . The PCP receive PWS prompt listing sign symptom apply child , base either exist data electronic record ( e.g. , current ADHD diagnosis ; overweight ) caregiver response item assess wait room ( e.g. , observed apnea ; daytime sleepiness ) . When evidence-based criterion meet , accord 2012 American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) guideline , PCP encourage refer child ( PSG , sleep specialist , ENT ) . In control clinic , parent complete surveillance question snoring , PCPs receive generic prompt receive additional information sign symptom guidance evaluate manage . For child CHICA-OSA control clinic , caregiver report snore item snore repeat one year later . Subsequent Visits : At next visit ( sick WCC ) , snore assess one health surveillance question eligible child . However , child CHICA-OSA clinic refer PSG previous visit receive additional item ask whether child adenotonsillectomy past year . If child surgery PCP receive prompt assess outcome original referral ( e.g. , PSG suggest OSA ; PSG suggest OSA surgery schedule ; PSG schedule ; adenotonsillectomy schedule ; family appointment ) re-refer appropriate . If caregiver report child T &amp; A long snore , PCP receive additional prompt snore reassess two year . However , caregiver report residual snoring surgery , provider receive prompt refer possible residual OSA .
