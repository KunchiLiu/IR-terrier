	<detailed_description>The overarch objective research study pursue large randomize control trial ( RCT ) focus old patient recently discharge hospital prescribed medication within one three high-priority , high-risk drug class order reduce risk clinically important medication error . The National Action Plan Adverse Drug Event ( ADE ) Prevention identify three high-priority drug class key target reduce risk drug-related injury : anticoagulant ; diabetes agent ( insulin oral agent ) ; opioids . These medication class choose account great number measurable drug-related harm patient , substantial proportion ADEs associate medication consider preventable . The clinical trial determine value multifaceted medication error ADE reduction intervention special focus in-home assessment . Components intervention include : ( 1 ) in-home assessment high-risk patient clinical pharmacist ; ( 2 ) best-practice , evidence-based medication safety tool resource target high-risk patient caregiver ; ( 3 ) communication primary care team via electronic health record ( EHR ) regard concern relevant use high-risk medication well medication safety concern ; ( 4 ) follow-up phone call pharmacist patient and/or caregiver within 14 day home visit . The primary outcome interest clinically important medication error , composite outcome comprise preventable ameliorable ADEs potential ADEs due medication discrepancy non-adherence . Secondary outcome include : ( 1 ) preventable ameliorable ADEs ; ( 2 ) potential ADEs due discrepancy non-adherence ; ( 3 ) preventable ameliorable ADEs judge serious , life-threatening , fatal . The specific aim study follow : Aim 1 : To adapt integrate exist `` best-practice , '' evidence-based medication safety tool , resource , approach cohesive , multifaceted intervention reduce occurrence clinically important medication error older adult recently discharge hospital use one three high-priority , high-risk drug class ( anticoagulant , diabetes agent , opioids ) . Aim 2 : To assess impact multifaceted intervention incidence clinically important medication error employ randomize control trial ( RCT ) design . Aim 3 : To conduct process evaluation assess intervention fidelity , adaptation , mechanisms impact , essential component , influence contextual factor . Aim 4 : To create : 1 ) plan disseminate study finding stakeholder might implement intervention make decision future use ; 2 ) implementation toolkit wish implement intervention practice .</detailed_description>
