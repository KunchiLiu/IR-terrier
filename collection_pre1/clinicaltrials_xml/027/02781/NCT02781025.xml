	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate feasibility use novel decellularized tissue matrix isolate culture circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) collect patient metastatic solid tumor malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Culture Circulating Tumor Cells Isolated From Cancer Patients With Metastatic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There currently practical reproducible model system recapitulate metastatic process well . CTCs important development metastasis interest isolate culture ex vivo good characterize biology , metastatic potential , response different therapy . The investigator previously demonstrate efficient capture enumeration CTCs 4 unique patient cohort ( metastatic prostate locally advanced rectal , cervical head neck cancer ) investigator prospective clinical study , LCCC 1408 ( Investigation Circulating Tumor Cells Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy ) . However , CTCs difficult culture conventional method . The investigator propose culture CTCs use novel decellularized tissue matrix . Blood collect cancer patient metastatic solid tissue tumor prior start definitive palliative radiotherapy . The investigator isolate CTCs attempt grow various decellularized matrix . If study successful feasibility demonstrate , important pilot information also gather used power sample size consideration future CTCs study .</detailed_description>
