	<brief_summary>The main objective research investigate effect addition fiber high fat high carbohydrate ( HFHC ) meal induced inflammation oxidative stress mechanism molecular level human , vivo . The investigator previously show intake one HFHC meal lead increase oxidative stress inflammation . HFHC meal also induce increase expression suppressor cytokine signaling- 3 ( SOCS-3 ) mononuclear cell ( MNC ) , interfere insulin signal transduction contributes pathogenesis insulin resistance . In contrast , American heart association ( AHA ) meal rich fruit fiber induce effect . These observation important since HFHC meal induces oxidative stress inflammation also lay foundation potentially great insulin resistance induction SOCS-3 , TLR-4 TLR-2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective research investigate effect high fat high carbohydrate ( HFHC ) meal inflammatory mechanism molecular level human , vivo versus HFHC meal plus fiber . HFHC meal include egg muffin , sausage muffin sandwich two hash brown . The Investigators previously show intake one HFHC meal lead increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) generation expression p47 , key subunit NADPH oxidase , concomitant increase intranuclear nuclear factor ÎºB ( NFkB ) binding . More recently , investigator also show HFHC meal lead increase plasma endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide , LPS ) concentration along increase expression Toll like receptor-4 ( TLR-4 ) , receptor endotoxin , TLR-2 , receptor several product Gram positive bacteria . In addition , also cause increase lipopolysaccharide bind protein ( LBP ) , protein facilitates bind LPS CD14 TLR-4 . Finally , HFHC meal also induce increase expression suppressor cytokine signaling- 3 ( SOCS-3 ) mononuclear cell ( MNC ) ( 1 ) , interfere insulin signal transduction contributes pathogenesis insulin resistance . In contrast , AHA meal induce effect . These observation important since HFHC meal induces oxidative stress inflammation also lay foundation ( 2 ) potentially great response inflammatory challenge induction increase LPS concentration expression TLR-4 TLR-2 ; ( 3 ) insulin resistance induction SOCS-3 , TLR-4 TLR-2 .</detailed_description>
