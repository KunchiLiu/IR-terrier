	<brief_summary>This study aim visualize implanted mesh vivo MRI 20 patient 1 month 12 month post-operatively . Moreover , want evaluate safety efficiency non-penetration mesh fixation technique use pre-designed ENDOLAP 3D visible mesh placement versus mesh fixation use synthetic LiquiBand Fix 8 glue laparoscopic treatment groin hernia . A total 100 male female patient enter trial Maria Middelares Ghent , inclusion period 24 month anticipate . Four surgeon department surgery screen eligible consecutive patient inclusion study . They inform patient surgery follow-up MRI scan thereafter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Groin Hernia Repair 3D ENDOLAP Visible Mesh With Without LiquiBand Fix 8 Mesh Fixation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernia common disease high lifetime risk ; 27 % men 3 % woman . These hernia categorize lateral , medial femoral accord classification European Hernia Society . The manifestation may vary asymptomatic swell till incarcerate strangulate hernia require urgent operation . The introduction mesh reinforcement groin hernia repair result reduce rate recurrence chronic pain . Moreover , laparoscopic repair technique make possible place mesh de pre-peritoneal space transperitoneal ( TAPP ) pre-peritoneal ( TEP ) approach . These minimally invasive technique associate less chronic pain numbness , also earlier return normal activity work . A favor one two technique yet prove . Also , repair groin hernia always go along discussion place optimal mesh , optimum mesh size optimal fixation method mesh . There lot mesh available different material , different size different property . The majority mesh need fix abdominal wall . Meshes anatomic ProGrip Laparoscopic self-fixating mesh ( Covidien ) develop self-fixating property due polylactic acid micro-grips one side mesh secures mesh without require form fixation . While ENDOLAP 3D visible mesh ( Dynamesh ) develop pre-shaped form fit defect naturally therefore make fixation redundant . However , consensus best method mesh fixation even non-fixation find common literature . Penetrating fixation method mesh strong positioning result , inguinal hernia , mesh fixation use titanium tack without suture clearly indicate development postoperative pain discomfort patient . Current recommendation avoid penetrate fixation replace either fixation fixation glue . This decrease pain risk less stable mesh fixation ongoing recurrence due mesh shift mesh shrinkage . It known majority implant mesh shrink extent , might disadvantage patient . This already demonstrate several animal study , clinical information mesh shrinkage rare mostly result revisional surgery . LiquiBand Fix 8 glue new , innovative hernia mesh fixation device provide strong secure mesh fixation without cause tissue damage mechanical trauma . LiquiBand Fix 8 receive CE mark approval May 2014 . All ordinary mesh groin hernia repair , base polymeric textile , invisible conventional imaging technique , inclusive `` magnetic resonance imaging '' ( MRI ) . The ENDOLAP 3D mesh visible ( Dynamesh ) , develop unique method , contain amount iron particle , woven ordinary structure mesh , allow image MRI .</detailed_description>
