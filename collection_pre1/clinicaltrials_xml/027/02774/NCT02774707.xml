	<brief_title>Comparing Quality Topical Autologous Serum Different Etiologies Dry Eye Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye important issue file ophthalmology great influence quality life many patient . Traditional treatment mainly focus artificial tear supplement . Inflammatory factor identify recent day think play important role etiology dry eye . Anti-inflammatory agent like topical immunosuppressant become another choice treatment dry eye . Conventional artificial tear similar biochemical feature osmolarity natural tear lack anti-inflammatory cytokine . Therefore , autologous serum apply substitute natural tear anti-inflammatory cytokine . Clinical trial show autologous serum drop improve ocular irritation symptom , conjunctival corneal dye stain dry eye . However , manufacture autologous serum , hard standardize every step control quality . What 's , patient may different etiology dry eye , include primary Sjogren 's syndrome , secondary Sjogren 's syndrome , autoimmune disease , ocular graft versus host disease . The etiology dry eye may different response autologous serum . However , n't know autologous serum different patient ' different component different component cytokine may different treatment efficacy . This want know study . Since human autologous serum need cytokine analysis , propose project collect human serum volunteersã€‚</detailed_description>
