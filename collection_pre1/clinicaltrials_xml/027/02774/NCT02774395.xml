	<brief_summary>The endometrial cancer among common malignancy postmenopausal woman incidence rise . It often endometrioid adenocarcinoma ( grade I , II , III ) . Other histological type represent mainly clear cell carcinoma , papillary serous carcinoma , carcinosarcoma . The main risk factor endometrial cancer age , obesity , diabetes , hypertension , hormone replacement therapy estrogen tamoxifen . Endometrial hyperplasia usually precede endometrial cancer classify degree cytologic atypia . Tumor grade quantifies degree differentiation significantly influence prognosis . Most research apply define role estrogen cancer , however accumulation data indicate general process tumorigenesis closely related immune inflammatory microenvironment tumor . In fact , microenvironment may see prognostic parameter tumor even predictive therapeutic response . Recognized key molecule responsible leukocyte recruitment tissue , chemokine-receptor pair key player immune response , include anti-tumor immune response also inflammatory response . The chemokine-receptor pair also involve many basic process proliferation , survival cell death . The objective study evaluate prognostic value expression chemokine fractalkine ( FKN ) receptor CX3CR1 development endometrioid adenocarcinoma . Chemokine FKN particularity exist two form , soluble ( FKNs ) , like chemokines membrane form ( FKNm ) . The FKNs , result proteolytic cleavage FKNm , provide ch√©moattractantes property . FKNm present adhesion molecule property . The role FKN cancer biology complex . To date , role FKN endometrial cancer report . Similarly , precise role FKN physiology endometrium unknown . Nevertheless , fractalkine one express endometrial chemokines . The expression FKN CX3CR1 receptor detect endometrium stage menstrual cycle . The respective level expression fluctuate largely dependent cycle stage suggest possible control estrogen progesterone control describe elsewhere ovarian level endothelial . The cell endometrial glandular epithelium , macrophage , neutrophil NK cell infiltrate tissue well endothelial cell blood vessel express FKN . Interestingly , cell mention express CX3CR1 , except NK cell unlike tissue , CD8 cell , present endometrium , express CX3CR1 . In addition , strong expression FKN CX3CR1 cell endometrial epithelial coincides maximum activity glandular epithelium suggest possible autocrine loop promote cell proliferation endometrium . Concurrently peak fractalkine , accumulation monocyte / macrophage neutrophil observe endometrium . It appear , moreover , balance soluble membrane form FKN important positioning , infiltration activity immune cell within endometrium . Current knowledge involvement FKN / CX3CR1 axis physiology endometrium , although incomplete , point unequivocally potential role ligand pair / receptor physiology tissue also suggest malfunction axis could easily cause various disease . Chronic inflammation tissue , largely dependent macrophage infiltration rate , generally represent tumor development . The endometrium subject physiologically cyclic regular inflammatory episode , mirror expression chemokines leukocyte infiltration . However , prolong leukocyte infiltration establish chronic prolonged inflammation endometrium could help shape favorable microenvironment tumor development . Curiously , axis FKN / CX3CR1 involve development several inflammatory disease , include obesity diabetes also risk factor endometrial cancer . A change expression FKN / CX3CR1 potentially capable alter inflammatory physiological cycle endometrium therefore likely element consider evaluation cancer risk factor endometrium . The assumption FKN / CX3CR1 couple could intervene pathophysiology endometrioid adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
