	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study side effect anti-ESO ( cancer/test antigen ) murine T-cell receptor ( mTCR ) -transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocyte combination chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine phosphate treat patient cancer spread place body ( metastatic ) express gene NY-ESO-1 . Donor white blood cell treat laboratory anti-cluster differentiation ( CD ) 3 may help treat metastatic cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide fludarabine phosphate , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell . Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell , include natural killer cell , kill metastatic cancer cell . Giving anti-ESO ( cancer/test antigen ) mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes together combination chemotherapy aldesleukin may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability administration anti-ESO ( cancer/test antigen ) mTCR ( T cell receptor ) -engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte ( anti-thyroglobulin mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocyte ) plus high-dose aldesleukin follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A2 positive patient metastatic cancer express ESO antigen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine vivo survival T-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene-engineered cell . II . Determine objective response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . OUTLINE : Patients receive standard cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day -7 -6 fludarabine phosphate via intravenous piggy back ( IVPB ) 30 minute day -5 -1 follow anti-ESO ( cancer/test antigen ) mTCR-transduced autologous peripheral blood lymphocyte IV 20-30 minute day 0 aldesleukin IV 15 minute approximately every 8 hour day 0-4 . Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-4 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , annually 5 year , periodically 10 year thereafter .</detailed_description>
