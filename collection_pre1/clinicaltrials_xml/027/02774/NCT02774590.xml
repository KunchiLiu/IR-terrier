	<brief_summary>This research do determine safety tolerability timolol treatment acne rosacea . The investigator also look specific biomolecular change acne rosacea skin expose timolol . Timolol approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment glaucoma . In dermatology , use treatment decrease size vascular ( blood vessel ) malformation infant skin . Timolol approve use acne rosacea use study investigational . Many people rosacea telangiectasias small , red dilate blood vessel skin . They also suffer flush acne-like lesion . Better treatment currently available desire . Acne vulgaris , acne , another chronic inflammatory common skin disease affect 8 10 young adult adolescent . Signs acne include papule blackhead often call primary lesion represent active form disease . There also secondary lesion form later ; know acne scar</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timolol Treatment Acne Rosacea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rosacea affect roughly 16 million Americans desire good treatment currently available . Acne vulgaris , another chronic inflammatory skin disorder , mainly affect teenager also affect 20-40 % adult . Investigating potential new treatment satisfy clinical need , also offer opportunity learn pathogenesis disease skin biology . The purpose study investigate possible role timolol therapy erythema papule associate acne rosacea . It show timolol beneficial safe treat infantile hemangioma . The investigator hypothesize may also safe effective treatment acne rosacea . In single experiment test case PI ( practice physician ) , investigator treat rosacea timolol off-label indication notice improvement flushing unexpected improvement acneiform eruption associate rosacea . After 30 day , less flushing acneiform lesion note treated right side compare left side . Similarly , 60 day treatment , visualize infrared imaging , significantly less inflammation flushing note treated right side even outside episode flush . The improvement durable , 60 day washout , improvement still note . In summary , test PI case subject , timolol appear effective , safe , disease-remissive effect . Our aim conduct 16 week split-face pilot study 30 patient diagnosis either inflammatory acne rosacea ass whether timolol maleate effectively reduce erythema , flushing , telangiectasias , and/or papule . The investigator also propose biopsy subset study patient examine biological activity skin treatment . The investigator particularly interested study epigenetic DNA methylation abnormality condition baseline compare normal subject result therapy .</detailed_description>
