	<brief_summary>This mentor student research project fund Graduate Research Partnership Program project timeline data collection summer 2015 . Previous research show language experience alters way human brain process speech information . This phenomenon take place early life refer Native Language Neural Commitment . For instance , Japanese language l-r speech sound contrast , Japanese infant start show difficulty hear difference English l r sound 12 month age 6 month old . Learning l-r distinction later life prove difficult Japanese school student adult . Brain imaging study reveal specific brain region change language learning . But evidence support Native Language Neural Commitment theory base cortical-level measure . The propose study extend measurement subcortical level brainstem . The target language investigator interested study Mandarin Chinese , know use lexical tone express different word . For instance , Chinese syllable `` '' mean `` mother '' speak flat tone , mean `` hemp '' speak rise tone . English , contrast , employ lexical tone , consider non-tonal language . Does Chinese learn experience fundamental change way pitch information cod human brain ? Does happen cortical subcortical level ? Previous research show evidence positive answer question . But direct evidence brain-behavior correlation subcortical level still miss . The propose cross-language study test Chinese-speaking English-speaking adult investigate Native Language Neural Commitment subcortical level . The investigator interested difference two subject population examine relationship brainstem pitch track behavioral pitch perception linguistic nonlinguistic stimulus . The result propose project contribute understanding role subcortical brainstem Native Language Neural Commitment , significant implication development auditory/speech train program assessment tool utilize brainstem frequency follow measure monitor progress second language learn test clinical population .</brief_summary>
