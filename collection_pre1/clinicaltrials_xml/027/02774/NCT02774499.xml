	<brief_summary>Oral medication like gabapentin acetaminophen commonly give patient prior surgery provide balance anaesthesia . Intravenous methadone show decrease postoperative pain well postoperative nausea vomiting , know barrier discharge . Oral methadone would convenient alternative give preoperative medication bioavailability approach 80 % . No clinical trial date explore utility oral methadone preoperative analgesic improve postoperative outcome . Current literature show preoperative IV methadone reduces opioid consumption perioperative period cardiac surgery ; therefore , investigator hypothesize preoperative oral methadone also reduce postoperative opioid consumption patient undergo sternotomy cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Oral Methadone Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery : Reduction Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators propose prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial investigate effect preoperative oral methadone postoperative opioid consumption . The trial conduct compliance protocol , Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) , University Saskatchewan Research Ethics Committee principle use intent-to-treat model . The primary endpoint total postoperative opioid consumption ICU , measure Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) Morphine equivalencies . Secondary endpoint include opioid consumption 15 minute 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour post extubation . Other secondary endpoint include follow : pain cough ( use 0-10 verbal pain scale ) measure time extubation daily post-op day three ; overall satisfaction pain management ( 0-100 ) record post-op day three . Secondary outcome record nursing assessment record include : incidence nausea and/or vomit require antiemetic , pruritus , hypoventilation ( respiratory rate le 8 breaths/min ) , hypoxemia ( oxygen saturation le 90 % ) , time extubation , sedation ( Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale -4 -5 ) . Patients telephone follow-up 6 month post coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) assessment sternotomy induce chronic pain . Patients receive dose either oral methadone placebo prior enter operate room . The dose give 0.3 mg/kg ( maximum 30 mg ) equivalent volume placebo . An unblinded research assistant receive envelope morning surgery outline patient placebo arm methadone arm well weight kg . For methadone arm research assistant prepare appropriate amount methadone , dispense 10 mg/mL , dilute total volume 5 mL sugary syrup mask taste . For placebo arm similar volume mix 0.3 mg/kg volume dilute total volume 5 mL sugary syrup . The methadone placebo give researcher syringe . The researcher administer blind diluted drug patient orally via syringe prior enter operate room .</detailed_description>
