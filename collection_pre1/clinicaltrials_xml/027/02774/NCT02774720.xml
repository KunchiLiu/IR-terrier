	<detailed_description>The aim trial compare effectiveness center-based versus home-based physical activity delivery among people MCI early dementia understand influence person set characteristic . OBJECTIVES : Primary : To compare effectiveness centre-based versus home-based physical activity delivery among people MCI early dementia , measure percent achievement physical activity guideline . Secondary : ( ) To determine influence person- setting-specific factor . ( ii ) To estimate cost-effectiveness centre-based home-based physical activity . Exploratory : ) To compare effect centre- home-based physical activity outcome . ii ) To explore whether participant consider certain aspect program important program effectiveness . METHODS : The investigator conduct 3-month proof-of-concept , double-blinded randomized , parallel group trial compare effectiveness centre-based home-based physical activity help people MCI early dementia meet physical activity recommendation . Participants randomize one two physical activity delivery options.The goal arm participant reach physical activity guideline end 3-month intervention . Participants randomize centre-based physical activity attend physical activity program centre ( University Waterloo Toronto Rehabilitation Institute ) per week one hour . Additional physical activity prescribe home . Participants randomize home-based physical activity receive physical activity prescription complete home . They also receive monthly support call assess achievement barrier adjust prescription . All assessor blind group allocation .</detailed_description>
