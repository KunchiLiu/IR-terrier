	<brief_summary>Pulmonary cavitation , hallmark tuberculosis ( TB ) , site high mycobacterial burden lead disease transmission . The cause tissue destruction lead cavitation TB primarily due host inflammatory response . A matrix degrade phenotype develops TB , activity host proteolytic enzyme , specifically matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) unopposed specific Tissue Inhibitors Metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , thus drive tissue destruction cavitation TB . This tissue destruction cause morbidity mortality . MMP inhibition doxycycline show improve lung function patient chronic lung disease use TB unclear . We hypothesise MMP inhibitor doxycycline reduce tissue destruction human pulmonary tuberculosis . Specific aim : - To investigate MMP TIMP secretion gene expression M. tuberculosis ( M.tb ) - infect primary neutrophil monocytes healthy volunteer take doxycycline . - To investigate intracellular signal pathway modulate doxycycline - To investigate effect doxycycline biological marker tissue destruction TB patient - To assess tolerability side effect doxycycline concurrent standard TB therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxycycline Human Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All TB patient keep standard anti-tuberculous treatment . A standardized questionnaire symptom , side-effects weight shall record . Induced sputum plasma sample TB patient shall analyse MMPs TIMPs administration doxycycline two week . In addition , neutrophils mononuclear cell TB patient shall stimulate live , virulent M. tuberculosis Biosafety Level 3 laboratory . The supernatant cell shall analyse MMPs TIMPs . Healthy volunteer shall recruit administered doxycycline 2 week . Neutrophils mononuclear cell isolate blood prior treatment , week 2 8 infected M.tb . Cell culture supernatant nucleic acid harvest . MMP TIMP expression analyse use luminex array real-time polymerase chain reaction . Intracellular signal pathway examine human phospho-kinase array . Matrix destruction assess use collagen quantitative fluorescent assay .</detailed_description>
