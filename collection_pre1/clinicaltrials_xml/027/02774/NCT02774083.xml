	<detailed_description>Introduction In recent decade , increase life expectancy , number old people relative rate within population rise dramatically . This trend lead increase rate people suffer mild cognitive disorder dementia develop country . Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) define transition state successful age state dementia . This state characterize cognitive impairment decline memory skill daily functioning maintain . Older people diagnose MCI increase risk develop dementia , particularly Alzheimer 's disease . This risk rank 12 % every year . Since pre-dementia stage , great importance lie find method could prevent least decelerated progress MCI dementia . Among effective program physical cognitive activity . The Feuerstein Program This program designate prevent mental deterioration preserve cognitive ability among people age 60 ( hereinafter `` The Feuerstein Program '' ) . The program initiative brainchild Professor Reuven Feuerstein - Israel Prize Laureate , founder President Feuerstein Institute Enhancement Learning Potential . The program apply practicable program base theory Structural Cognitive Modifiability well Mediated Learning Experience . For needs program , tool suit unique characteristic requirement elderly population . The program compose variety tool ( hereinafter : instrumental enrichment ) offer systematic activity intend stimulate mental cognitive development . Instrumental enrichment set tool deal require thinking skill designate significantly promote learn thinking process . The task various tool free educational content engage pure learn think process . The tool deliver special mediation process , teacher supervisor train specialized course . Objectives Feuerstein Program The main objective : enhance transformation ( variability ) capacity human . The sub-objectives : 1 . Correction development defective thinking skill , responsible learn difficulty absence transformation ( variability ) . 2 . Equipping learner literal conceptual content require learning process . 3 . Creating establish proper sound think work habit . 4 . Creating insight awareness regard process involve learn . 5 . Creating internal motivation carry task . The Learning Process The instrumental enrichment tool distribute participant work sheet . The teacher create `` mediate '' dialogue participant , thus enable construct learn skill essential thinking strategy . In addition , teacher bridge learn skill study daily life elderly participant . Products 1 . Creating within awareness learn think process ( Metacognition ) introduce optimistic positive attitude towards ability effect significant change area . 2 . Instill elderly person control think skill . 3 . Enhancing sense capability elderly person . The Intervention Focuses Instrumental Enrichment Tools utilized Program 1 . Methodical information gathering . 2 . Orientation function space time . 3 . Comparison sort capability . 4 . Memory . 5 . Raising hypothesis examination . 6 . Perspicuousness ( clear wording ) name capability . The Control Group The Control Group participate program Adler Institute involve activity aim social emotional development without specific cognitive skill train . Research Objective To examine influence Feuerstein Program cognitive condition participant suffer Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . Research Hypothesis The Feuerstein Program improve cognitive functional condition participant . Methodology Randomised control intervention study involve subject Mild Neurocognitive Disorder . Research Assessment Tools 1 . Cognitive screening mean MoCA ( Montreal Cognitive Assessment ) Test . 2 . Instrumental daily function assess Lawton Brody 's Instrument . 3 . Depression screen base follow question : `` Are feel sad depress ? '' . A positive response question find efficient screen tool depression . 4 . Will live base follow question : If could describe live scale 0 5 , would say : 5 = strong 0 = live . 5 . CogSym ( Cognitive Symptom ) Meta-cognition questionnaire compose ten item relate cognitive ability examinee daily function . The examinee ask assess item , ability level function describe , 5 level scale ( 1 = excellent , 5 = inferior ) . 6 . World Health Organization well-being index questionnaire . 7 . The Neurotrax computerize cognitive assessment battery . The intervention Participants randomly allocate Intervention Group use Feuerstein Program Control Group Adler Institute involve 30 twice weekly session last 90 minute 15 week . Assessments perform baseline , session 15 session 30 , finally 6 month follow study commencement . Data Analysis The statistical analysis conduct customary clinical research within field .</detailed_description>
