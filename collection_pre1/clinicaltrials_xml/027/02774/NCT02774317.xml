	<brief_summary>With advent measure try decrease incidence transfusion-related acute lung injury ( TRALI ) , Blood Bank industry attempt avoid collection plasma female donor pregnant order reduce transfusion plasma may contain HLA antibody . This lead decrease number donor available production fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) . Per Blood Bank regulatory standard United States , FFP must freeze within 8 hour collection . Plasma freeze within 24 hour collection call FP24 , produce whole blood process within 8-hour time period generation FFP . Studies coagulation factor FFP FP24 show coagulation factor activity adequate maintain hemostasis product . Many hospital use FFP FP24 interchangeably adult , occasional hospital use product interchangeably neonate . However , study concern use FP24 neonates perform . The investigator propose single center prospective pilot study compare clinical efficacy FFP vs. FP24 50 nonsurgical neonate baby age 6 month require plasma International Normalization Ratio ( INR ) 1.5 . This protocol describe pilot study compare use FFP FP24 nonsurgical neonate . Use plasma case mostly patient perinatal hypoxia necrotizing enterocolitis INR 1.5 . Transfusion plasma ( 10 15 ml/kg ) perform patient approximately every 8 , 12 , 24 hour , deem indicated patient 's clinician , monitor prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) , INR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Compare Fresh Frozen Plasma With 24-Hour Plasma Babies Up Age Six Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Half patient randomize Blood Bank receive FFP , half FP24 . All patient monitor usual way , careful clinical observation PT/PTT/INR , draw 12 24 hour base clinical necessity . If patient need additional transfusion , type product administer episode .</detailed_description>
