	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate study drug palbociclib anti-tumor activity breast cancer spread brain also determine overall radiographic response rate CNS . Palbociclib anti-cancer medication show stop cancer cell grow . It approve hormone positive breast cancer , along hormone therapy find effective . The preclinical study suggest drug may also activity type breast cancer , triple negative HER2 positive breast cancer . The purpose study see study drug effective patient brain metastasis , triple negative HER2-positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palbociclib Treating Patients With Metastatic HER-2 Positive Triple-Negative Breast Cancer With Brain Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine radiographic response rate central nervous system ( CNS ) patient TNBC HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis treat palbociclib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient TNBC HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis treat palbociclib . II . To determine time CNS progression patient TNBC HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis treat palbociclib . III . To determine systemic overall response rate ( ORR ) patient TNBC HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis treat palbociclib . IV . To determine safety tolerability palbociclib patient TNBC HER2-positive breast cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) baseline , 2 month 4 month ; particularly ass cyclin D1 aberration , predictive response . II . To evaluate genomic landscape available CNS non-CNS tumor , describe discordance . III . To evaluate cognitive function quality life baseline , 2 4 month patient receive palbociclib . OUTLINE : Patients receive palbociclib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients HER2 positive breast cancer may also receive trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) standard care concurrently palbociclib . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
