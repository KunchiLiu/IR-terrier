	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) characterize chronic inflammation limit mucosal layer colon . Anemia consistent clinical feature IBD . It encounter one third IBD patient , common extraintestinal complication disease . Anemia significant impact quality life affect patient . Many patient IBD frequently complain chronic fatigue commonly cause anemia may debilitate patient abdominal pain diarrhea . Anemia IBD multifactorial , commonly result iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) rarely due anemia chronic disease ( ACD ) . Oral iron supplementation use traditionally treatment IDA study show may result disease exacerbation increase oxygen free radical within lumen gut via Fenton reaction . A recent study do University Hospitals Birmingham , United Kingdom , show treatment oral iron result failure control anemia 2 3 IBD patient , part due side effect report half patient . Captafer new iron-free oral preparation contain special type oligosaccharide fish muscle tissue able make intestine absorb 3 5 time iron comparison `` meat factor '' . Moreover , Captafer contain vitamin supplement improve anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Captafer® v . Oral Iron Sulfate Treatment Iron Deficiency Anemia Patients With IBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty patient outpatient department AUBMC enrol open label cross-over trial . Patients active leave sided ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease active extensive disease proven IDA enrol . Study patient receive treatment follow informed consent follow regularly study coordinator side effect , compliance adherence . A blood test hemoglobin hematocrit biomarkers iron store repletion do patient baseline 6 week 12 week therapy . In case patient tolerate either treatment , switch treatment washout period 2 week . The objective study compare efficacy safety Captafer iron-free ( one fix non disclose dose ) food supplement give twice daily , oral iron therapy give dose 195 mg twice daily period time open label cross-over trial treatment iron deficiency anemia ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease patient . Primary endpoint : Tolerability Secondary endpoint Response iron repletion use hemoglobin hematocrit surrogate Compliance adherence ( monthly pill count ) The study sample size calculate base primary end point tolerability significance level ( α ) 0.05 , Power ( 1-β ) 0.8 expect 90 % tolerability adherence Captafer vs. 50 % oral iron . At parameter , take non-inferiority limit 5 % , sample size calculate 20 .</detailed_description>
