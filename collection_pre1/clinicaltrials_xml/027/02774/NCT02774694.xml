	<brief_summary>Interventional pain management back neck pain widely use , indication relative merit technique rest subject discussion . This study aim identify prognostic criterion patient might specifically benefit interventional pain management . Specifically , nociceptive reflex threshold investigate , measure central sensibilisation thus potentially important prognostic factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interventional pain management resource-intensive carry non-negligible risk . Not patient profit equally procedure . For benefit , risk potential complication futile , resource waste . Therefore , possibility distinguish respond patient non-responders would important . Central pain sensitization relate poor outcome , electrical pain reflex threshold good measure pain hypersensitivity least chronic low back pain . Especially nociceptive flexion reflex ( NFR ) threshold identify correlate well central pain hypersensibility . Successful interventional pain treatment show reverse central hypersensibility measure NFR threshold . NFR threshold , contrast pain threshold , seem measure independent psychological factor . Thus NFR threshold could give information independent psychological factor order predict poor outcome interventional pain management procedure . The study prospective observational trial diagnostic accuracy .</detailed_description>
