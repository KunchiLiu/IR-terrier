	<detailed_description>Title : Evaluating Efficacy Safety Innovative Affordable Lung Surfactant treatment Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( RDS ) preterm neonate : multi-site randomized clinical trial Phase Development : Phase II/ III Indication : Respiratory Distress Syndrome Primary Objective : To compare incidence survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) 36 week postmenstrual age preterm neonate ( ≤32 wk ) RDS randomize receive intratracheal administration ( 100 mg/kg ) either goat lung surfactant extract ( GLSE ) standard preparation ( Beractant ; Survanta ; Abbott , USA ) Secondary Objective : 1 To compare area curve ( AUC ) oxygen requirement ( FiO2 ) requirement first 48 h surfactant administration 2 To compare incidence safety outcomes namely air leak , pulmonary hemorrhage , intraventricular hemorrhage , neonatal mortality , sepsis retinopathy prematurity Study Design : A multicentric , non-inferiority randomize control trial ( RCT ) preterm infant RDS . Study Centers : The study would conduct 12-14 academic center India . Study population : A total approximately 900 eligible preterm neonate enrol study . Planned No . subject : N~900 enrol 12-14 center Investigational Product : GLSE ( Lung Surfactant Extract ) Cadisurf 25 Dosage site administration : Dosage : Neonates intervention group administer 100 mg/kg GLSE . Those control group administer 100 mg/kg Beractant ( Survanta® , Abbott , USA ) . Site Administration : Intratracheal Expected Duration Participation Subject : 4-10 Weeks Expected duration study 3 year Methodology The study would conduct 12-14 study site . The dedicated study team leadership site Principal Investigator ( PI ) site would implement study protocol per uniform standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) . Written inform consent take legally authorize representative ( LAR ) subject . Subjects enrol base inclusion/exclusion criterion depict institute ethic committee ( IEC ) &amp; Central drug standard control organization ( CDSCO ) approve protocol . After satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion subject randomize either GLSE arm Beractant ( Survanta® , Abbott , USA ) arm . The duration hospitalization would 4-10 week . Enrolled infant would monitor study team round clock per standard procedure . The study infant would follow death 36 week postmenstrual age ( PMA ) . Adverse event &amp; serious adverse event record &amp; report per regulatory guideline India . The study infant would follow 36 week PMA . The study would conduct 12-14 study site . The study conduct highly supervised clinical set immediate availability clinician experienced intubation , ventilator management general care premature infant . Infants receive surfactant frequently monitor arterial transcutaneous measurement systemic O2 CO2 . The dedicated study team site would implement study protocol per uniform standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) . Primary Study Endpoint • BPD free survival Blinding Procedures 1 . Random sequence The random sequence generate use web base algorithm 1:1 allocation stratification site gestation ( &lt; 28 28-32 week ) permute block random size . The block size blind investigator . 2 . Allocation concealment The vial two surfactant product would package identical cardboard box ( CDSA ) sequentially number per allocation sequence two gestation stratum ( 8 mL vial strata 26-27 week 28-32 week , respectively ) site . 3 . Implementation The randomization sequence would generate independent statistician keep safe custody undisclosed investigator . Dedicated research team would track , ascertain eligibility randomize infant measure outcomes . The clinical team would administer surfactant blind research team . 4 . Blinding Clinicians would aware type surfactant product receive neonate give different physical appearance product vial Cadisurf® Survanta® . Clinicians would administer surfactant baby baby 's bed cordoned rest NICU cloth screen . The parent research staff responsible outcome assessment would keep blinded intervention . The allocation would conceal dataset researcher analyse data without information allocation . Interim analysis Interim analyse , desire Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , propose enrolment 5 % , 33 % 66 % target sample size . The DSMB would access result analyse . Interim analysis conduct use O'Brien-Fleming spending function type I error rate 5 % .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Neonates bear study site fulfil follow criterion eligible enrolment study 1 . Gestational age ≤32 complete week 2 . Onset respiratory distress within six hour age 3 . If baby meet criteria surfactant replacement therapy : 1 . FiO2 need 40 % high baby CPAP maintain preductal oxygen saturation 90 % 95 % 2 . Baby need intubation CPAP failure severe respiratory distress ( Chest Xray mandatory decide need SRT ) . Detailed SOPs develop respect assess eligibility SRT Neonates follow criterion exclude : 1 . Gestation 26 wk 2 . Babies severe birth asphyxia define need chest compression and/or initial ( umbilical arterial/or within 1 hour birth ) pH &lt; 7.0 3 . Major congenital malformation 4 . Prophylactic surfactant administration , i.e . administration surfactant infant develop respiratory distress 5 . Air leak pulmonary hemorrhage prior enrollment 6 . Shock require vasopressor support prior enrollment</criteria>
