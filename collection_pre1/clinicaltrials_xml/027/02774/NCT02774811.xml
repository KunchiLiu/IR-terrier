	<detailed_description>A debate continue concern best first-line therapy African primary open angle glaucoma . Most African practitioner advocate first line trabeculectomy surgery yet frequently practice first line drug therapy patient acceptance issue . In developed world range first line therapy include drug , SLT , cyclodiode ciliary body ablation , trabeculectomy surgery , drainage tube surgery drainage procedure ( viscocanalostomy , non-penetrating surgery etc ) advocate . There paucity good evidence concern relative merit approach African context . The purpose study compare two approach first line therapy primary open angle glaucoma African population . Design A two centre randomise prospective trial SLT vs. prostaglandin analogue first line therapy primary open angle glaucoma . Methods African patient establish newly diagnose primary open angle glaucoma patient POAG currently single drug therapy ( exclude prostaglandin analogue ) elevate IOP recruit Innovation Eye Centre Kisii , Kenya McCord Hospital , University KwaZulu-Natal , Durban , South Africa . While clinically indicated eye treat , one eye per patient include study . After informed consent patient undergo standardise examination establish baseline ocular function finding . All patient receive counsel glaucoma , disease , mean therapy . The patient randomise ( randomisation London , contain seal opaque envelope ) receive SLT prostaglandin analogue therapy . Every effort make follow patient accord standardise protocol minimum month 3 , month 6 month 12 . All therapeutic failure follow closely ascertain management plan subsequent therapeutic compliance . Follow-up offer beyond 12 month . Medical therapy Those randomise medical therapy patient receive free Prostaglandin analogue KZN Innovation Eye Centre counsel drop instillation instruction renewal prescription . Prescription renewal free charge.. An appointment give review 3 month . Considerable attention pay estimate compliance include use bottle weigh questionnaire already develop use locally . SLT THERAPY Those randomise SLT receive counseling effect management SLT . System : Selecta II ( Lumenis ) - Frequency double Nd : YAG ( 532nm ) Pre-Laser Treatment - Topical anesthesia ( e.g . proxymetacaine hydrochloride ) - Prophylactic application alpha agonist equivalent agent ( e.g . brimonidine ) avoid - Post-op pressure spike Laser Treatment parameter : 1 . Duration 3ns ( preset ) 2 . Spot size 400µ ( preset ) 3 . Number application : 100 4 . Extent angle : 360 degree 5 . Power ( dependent angle pigmentation ) - If pigmentation 1 2. start 0.8 mJ adjust power 0.1 mJ increment visible response ( cavitation bubble - colloquially refer `` champagne bubble '' ) - If pigment grade 3 4 , start low energy 0.4 mJ adjust power 0.1 mJ increment visible response - When reach treatment endpoint ( cavitation bubble ) , scale energy level 0.1 mJ remain threshold throughout treatment - It recommend re-evaluate threshold follow treatment quadrant , due variation TM pigmentation reach treatment endpoint ( cavitation bubble ) Post-Laser Treatment - Patient 's IOP follow - one hour post treatment - NSAIDS 2-3 day post-op , depend level patient discomfort - It recommend prescribe steroidal medication may potentially interfere SLT mechanism action . Follow-up At 3 month Patients structure questionnaire relate adverse effect therapeutic intervention . They receive examination visual function , external ocular structure intraocular pressure addition optic nerve head . Those unacceptable topical/systemic side effect partial complete failure IOP control ( see outcomes ) secondary therapy commence form timolol 0.5 % , contraindicate , either brimonidine oral acetazolamide ) ) . The secondary therapy either replace additive primary therapy depend initial response . At 6 month Patients structure questionnaire relate adverse effect therapeutic intervention . They receive examination visual function , external ocular stuctures intraocular pressure addition optic nerve head . Those unacceptable topical/systemic side effect partial complete failure IOP control ( see outcomes ) secondary tertiary therapy commence form timolol 0.5 % , contraindicate , either brimonidine oral acetazolamide ) ) surgical intervention form trabeculectomy cytotoxic . At 12 month Patients structure questionnaire relate adverse effect therapeutic intervention . This questionnaire also include question relate acceptance therapy view therapy . They receive detailed examination visual function ocular parameter . Those unacceptable topical/systemic side effect partial complete failure IOP control ( see outcomes ) evidence glaucoma progression secondary tertiary therapy commence form timolol 0.5 % , contraindicate , either brimonidine oral acetazolamide ) ) surgical intervention form trabeculectomy cytotoxic .</detailed_description>
