	<brief_summary>Low flow anesthesia ( LFA ) use less desirable , partly one consider might danger underdosing anesthesia gas thus risk awareness anesthesia.LFA several advantage reduce loss moisture heat inhale air anesthesia reduce consumption anesthetic gas . A anesthesia machine include automatic gas control system : Aisys machine , GE Healthcare ( Madison , WI , USA ) , Flow-i machine , Maquet ( Sweden ) . Since machine introduce , study report functionality effect gas consumption . 20 55 % reduction gas consumption find . The potential reduction may underestimate majority case FGF high 1 l/min still use . In study consumption anesthetic gas ( desflurane ) deliver two different anesthesia machine ( Aisys Flow-i ) compare , without gas control delivery system . Gas consumption time need reach target level anesthetic gas concentration assess . Data need collect directly anesthesia machine , PICIS ( Electronic anesthesia record ) EPJ ( Electronic patient journal ) . The result study interest intraoperative ventilation economic ecological interest</brief_summary>
