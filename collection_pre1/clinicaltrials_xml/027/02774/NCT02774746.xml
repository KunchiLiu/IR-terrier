	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate hypothesis delivery 36 0/7- 36 6/7 week stable patient gastroschisis superior observation expectant management . To test hypothesis , complete randomize , prospective , multi-institutional trial across North American Fetal Therapy Network-affiliated institution . Patients may enrol study time prior 34 week , randomize 34 week delivery 36 week observation . The primary composite outcome include stillbirth , neonatal death prior discharge , respiratory morbidity , need parenteral nutrition 30 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastroschisis Outcomes Delivery ( GOOD ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroschisis common congenital abdominal wall abnormality intestine herniated defect amniotic fluid . This diagnosed prenatal ultrasound 18-20 week gestation . Gastroschisis occur 1 every 4000 birth incidence increase . The majority patient gastroschisis uncomplicated neonatal course recover well surgical repair . However , subset gastroschisis patient complicate course due loss intestine atresia . This may due exposure herniated intestine caustic effect amniotic fluid narrow abdominal wall defect time cause constriction intestinal blood supply . Additionally , gastroschisis patient increase risk in-utero fetal demise . The potential risk pregnancy loss late third trimester prompt provider deliver gastroschisis patient prior term . This result additional prematurity-related morbidity . There consensus ideal time deliver baby gastroschisis practice pattern vary widely . Retrospective data publish show inconsistent result outcomes early delivery later gestational age delivery gastroschisis . There one randomized , prospective trial delivery 36 week versus await spontaneous labor . This include 42 patient render study largely underpowered . There trend towards decrease length hospital stay early time full enteral feed 36 week delivery group , reach statistical significance . As current available literature adequately answer question optimal gestational age delivery patient gastroschisis , objective study investigate hypothesis delivery 36 0/7- 36 6/7 week stable patient gastroschisis superior observation expectant management . To test hypothesis , complete randomize , prospective , multi-institutional trial . Patients may enrol study time prior 34 week , randomize 34 week delivery 36 week observation . The primary composite outcome include stillbirth , neonatal death prior discharge , respiratory morbidity , need enteral nutrition 30days . Secondary maternal outcome include need indication cesarean section , whether patient require induction labor spontaneous labor , value antenatal test include amniotic fluid index ( AFI ) , bowel diameter , estimate fetal weight . Secondary neonatal outcome include difference birth weight , need respiratory support independent operating room , gastroschisis bowel prognostic score , intestinal atresia , necrotizing enterocolitis , central venous catheter day , length respiratory support , need caffeine , bacteremia , discharge weight , length stay .</detailed_description>
