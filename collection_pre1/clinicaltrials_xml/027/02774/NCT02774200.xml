	<criteria>Age 18 year 75 year Histologically cytologically confirmation renal clear cell histologic component metastasis Presence single diameter measurable lesion ( eg , ≥1 malignant tumor least one single diameter accurately measure , conventional computer tomography scan [ CT ] magnetic resonance [ MRI ] require least one path ≥20mm , interphase reconstruction spiral compute tomography scan ≤5mm [ CT ] , least one path ≥10mm ) . Bone lesion , ascites , peritoneal metastasis miliary lesion , pleural pericardial effusion , skin lung lymphangitis , cystic lesion lesion radiotherapy measurable lesion Life expectancy 3 month The progress disease must accord RECIST criterion ( version 1.0 ) previous systemic treatment firstline metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Previous treatment program include one follow drug : Sunitinib , Sorafenib , Bevacizumab + Interferonα ( IFNα ) , Temsirolimus Cytokine ; Adequate organ function , define follow : absolute number Neutrophil ( ANC ) 1500 cell / mm3 ; Platelet 75,000 cell / mm3 ; Hemoglobin 9.0 g / dL ; Aspartate aminotransferase（AST）and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 2.5 x upper limit normal ( xULN ) , liver metastasis , Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ALT le 5.0 time ULN ; Total bilirubin less 1.5 time ULN，Serum Creatinine less 1.5 time ULN , Creatinine clearance 60 mL/min , Urinary dipstick proteinuria &lt; 2+ . If urine protein 2+ , need 24hour urinary protein excretion , 24hour urine protein &lt; 2 g Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 The prior systemic therapy , radiation therapy , surgery least two week apart ( bevacizumab + IFNα therapy least 4 week apart ) , treatmentrelated toxicity recover ≤1 grade define accord 3.0 version NCI CTCAE define , recover baseline level , except alopecia , hypothyroidism The measure value twice baseline blood pressure ( interval least 1 hour ) show inexistent Hypertension control medication . Baseline systolic blood pressure le 140 mm Hg , baseline diastolic blood pressure le 90 mm Hg . Patients antihypertensive drug control group For fertility woman , serum urine pregnancy test must negative within pretreatment three day Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment Patient consent well compliance , schedule accept visit , treatment , laboratory test study procedure Patients receive one firstline Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma ( mRCC ) systemic treatment Patients receive neoadjuvant adjuvant systemic treatment Begin study 4 week later major surgery treatment time , 2 week later radiotherapy . Allow receive palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion , least one measurable lesion receive radiation therapy The gastrointestinal tract anomalies unable take oral medication require intravenous nutrition previous surgical treatment influence drug absorption include total gastrectomy In past six month treat active ulcer disease In past three month cancer unrelated activity gastrointestinal bleeding , include vomit blood , blood stool black stool , endoscopy colonoscopy colon without evidence remission malabsorption syndrome . Currently accept may need accept treatment potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( eg , grapefruit juice , verapamil , ketoconazole , miconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , telithromycin , clarithromycin , indinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , lopinavir , atazanavir , amprenavir , bless Secretary amprenavir delavirdine ) Currently accept may need accept CYP3A4 CYP1A2 inducer treatment ( eg , carbamazepine , dexamethasone , felbamate , omeprazole , phenobarbital , phenytoin , amobarbital , nevirapine , primidone , rifabutin , rifampicin , Hypericum perforatum ) Need accept oral vitamin K antagonists anticoagulant therapy . Allows use low dose anticoagulant drug remain central venous channel unobstructed prevention deep vein thrombosis . Allow treatment dose low molecular heparin Active epilepsy brain metastasis , spinal cord compression meningitis carcinomatosa Patients unable control disease active infection Situation appear within 12 month study drug : myocardial infarction , uncontrolled angina , coronary artery/peripheral artery bypass grafting , symptom congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 6 month Known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) relate diseases Medical History : Have malignant tumor ( except renal cell carcinoma ) , include treatable form skin cancer ( non malignant melanoma ) , breast carcinoma situ cervical carcinoma situ , tumor cure , evidence disease recurrence within 2 year Patients dementia obvious mental retardation Women pregnancy lactation , fertility treatment 6 month treatment termination unwilling unable use effective contraception avoid pregnancy patient male female With serious acute chronic physical mental illness abnormal laboratory test , accord judgment may increase risk participate research related drug treatment , may affect interpretation result , situation researcher consider unsuitable study</criteria>
