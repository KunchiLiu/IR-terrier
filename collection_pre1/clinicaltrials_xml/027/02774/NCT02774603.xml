	<brief_summary>The aim study define evaluate efficacy Aquatic Locomotor Training ( ALT ) compare overground Locomotor Training improve ambulatory function health-related quality life . The investigator hypothesize , Aquatic Locomotor Training capable produce outcomes good , good , overground Locomotor Training . Aquatic Locomotor Training may another tool therapists utilize clinical improvement function gait Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) population . To determine efficacy Aquatic Locomotor Training improve rehabilitation outcome among patient incomplete traumatic cervical Spinal Cord Injury assess parameter : 1 . Walking speed endurance 2 . Functional balance fall risk 3 . HRQoL To describe feasibility conduct Aquatic Locomotor Training Locomotor Training modality rehabilitation patient incomplete traumatic cervical Spinal Cord Injury .</brief_summary>
