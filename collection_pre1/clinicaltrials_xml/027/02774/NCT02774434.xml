	<brief_summary>The Canadian Pediatric Society recently publish guideline monitor bilirubin level part standard care hospitalize newborns routinely monitor development high bilirubin jaundice every 8-12 hour . One device approve used Canada United States Draeger Jaundice Meter JM-103 , non-invasive medical device . It proven effective patient &gt; 35 week gestational age . Recently JM-103 upgrade include big touch screen , great storage functionality . The rest feature JM-103 JM-105 identical . In order test accuracy JM-105 neonates ≥ 24 week gestational age undergone phototherapy prospectively monitor transcutaneous bilirubin ( TcB ) use JM-105 . The measurement compare physician-ordered total serum bilirubin ( TSB ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Draeger Jaundice Meter ( JM-105 ) Neonates ≥ 24 Weeks Gestational Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperbilirubinemia condition occur newborns much bilirubin blood . It common cause newborn readmitted hospital . It may harmless harmful depend cause bad . The serum level bilirubin require jaundice varies infant skin tone body region , however jaundice usually become visible white part eye small level . Although jaundice newborn generally harmful , important monitor newborn identify risk develop neurological dysfunction high bilirubin level . As part standard care hospitalize newborns routinely monitor development jaundice nursing staff physicians every 8-12 hour . Although jaundice newborn usually detect lightening/whitening skin digital pressure , method visual estimation inaccurate unreliable . Transcutaneous bilirubin measurement non-invasive proven equivalent total serum bilirubin measurement . The JM-103 proven effective TcB measure ethnically diverse population patient &gt; 35 week gestational age . The JM-105 upgrade JM-103 great efficiency accuracy . The basic function improve large touch screen , data storage transmission functionality . This prospective multi-centre study conduct determine diagnostic accuracy performance use JM-105 provide transcutaneous bilirubin measurement estimate serum total bilirubin neonate ≥ 24 week gestational age undergone phototherapy . The study compare measurement transcutaneous bilirubin ( TcB ) obtain 10 day via JM-105 device neonatology team-ordered series serum total bilirubin ( TSB ) measure high-performance liquid chromatography .</detailed_description>
