	<detailed_description>It unknown clinically relevant between-person difference blood pressure response give drug , i.e . responder non-responders drug . If major between-person variation blood pressure response side effect drug , potential precision medicine . It also unknown between- person difference blood pressure response different different drug , magnitude within- between-person variation side effect particularly unknown . Resolving issue imperative possibility precision blood pressure-lowering treatment , study aim initially answer question . If study prove potential personalized blood pressure-lowering treatment , investigator explore promising predictor blood pressure side effect response four major first-line class blood pressure-lowering drug , use several modality -omics method combination clinical data . Using data , investigator develop evaluate point-of-care biomarker panel rank suitability blood pressure-lowering drug class individual patient term anticipate blood pressure effect side effect , thereby provide suggestion priority drug . The PHYSIC study double-blind , randomize , repeat cross-over trial six treatment period : four class blood pressure-lowering drug treatment two class repeat patient . The class blood pressure-lowering drug test diuretic , calcium channel blocker , ACE-inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker . The repeated treatment period allow investigator ass whether consistent preference one treatment another within blind patient different treatment period . This key often overlooked element exploration potential precision medicine . Evidence-based titration target dose chosen four drug class include . The suggested treatment duration 7-9 week per treatment arm base recent guideline . Patients assign treatment order base block randomization ensure number patient repeat pair treatment . The study test several pre-defined hypothesis , adjust multiple testing . The main outcome variable variation daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure assess blinded fashion . The screen visit ( visit 1 ) occur least two week randomization ( visit 2 ) . At screening , consent patient assessed ensure meet eligibility criterion initially . Patients meet criterion must enrol study . Patients meet criterion allocate enrolment number . The amount assessment make visit include consent procedure , weight , height , waist , hip circumference , physical examination , concomitant medication , blood pressure , blood sample safety assessment DNA genetics . The patient fill two questionnaire cover medical history belief medicine . In order introduce self-reporting symptom quality life collect electronic diary get baseline measurement patient ask log fill diary supervision study staff . After screen visit , patient stop take blood pressure-lowering drug start unblinded placebo treatment run-in period two week establish untreated baseline use characterization study sample . During placebo run-in patient access electronic diary reporting symptom quality life . Patients also prompt via sm fill diary home period . At visit 2 , eligibility criterion check . Concomitant medication check blood pressure measure . Other blood pressure-lowering drug allow concomitant medication . Baseline assessment make visit include venous blood sampling ( DNA methylation , RNA , proteins metabolite ) , capillary blood sampling , safety sampling , pulse wave analysis , initiation 24h blood pressure ECG measurement . The study staff also collect AE ́s via open question observation . Furthermore patient also fill validate questionnaire measure perceive symptom associate antihypertensive drug ( PERSYVE ) . If criterion meet , patient randomize consecutive randomization number give first investigational product ( IP ) . The IP take daily . Each treatment period 7-9 week ( titration dose 2 week + target dose 5-7 week ) dose take place home . The day visit 2 patient return 24 h blood pressure ECG equipment clinic . Between visit 2 3 patient dose home . Throughout study , patient access electronic diary reporting symptom quality life , use validated questionnaire , PERSYVE ( section 2.1 questionnaire use study ) . Patients also prompt via sm fill questionnaire home specific time point - week 3 , week 5 week 7 treatment period . At visit 3 treatment period patient come fasting clinic venous blood sampling ( DNA methylation , RNA , proteins metabolite ) , capillary blood sampling , pulse wave analysis , concomitant medication check , blood pressure measurement , initiation 24h blood pressure ECG measurement . The study staff also collect adverse event ( AEs ) via open question observation . All AEs assess Principal Investigator . Furthermore , patient also fill two paper questionnaire ; PERSYVE section 2.1 ( identical questionnaire electronic diary ) treatment preference rating questionnaire . The patient return unused IP site , except 1 capsule take following day . The study personnel give patient next treatment patient undergo batch , start 7- day placebo washout period next active drug treatment period start . Lastly , blood sample obtain analyzed safety parameter visit 3 last treatment period . At visit 4 ( Week 8 visit ) 24h blood pressure ECG measurement end . One week visit 4 last treatment period , patient come clinic last visit . During visit patient ask overall treatment preference rating include treatment period . An independent unblinded study physician delegate break blind complete patient prescribe prefer IP continuous use .</detailed_description>
