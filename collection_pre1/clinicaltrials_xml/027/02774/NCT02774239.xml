	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial To Assess The Feasibility And Efficacy Of SCIG In Patients With MG Exacerbation ( SCIG-MG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective open-label , uncontrolled , single-blind , pilot clinical trial . The primary objective ass efficacy , safety , feasibility tolerability SCIG patient worsen MG. Study Rationale Significance Subcutaneous immunoglobulin ( SCIG ) novel form immune therapy neuromuscular disease may offer several advantage intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) . Although large-scale study conduct MG patient , pilot study SCIG multifocal motor neuropathy indicate may feasible , effective safe alternative IVIG condition , like MG , show excellent response IVIG infusion . Patients able tolerate good improve quality life due add flexibility treatment schedule . SCIG also potentially less expensive IVIG since cost associated inpatient treatment well nurse support save . SCIG also potential effective durable since serum level immunoglobulin show sustained increase compare IVIG . A drawback associate SCIG small amount immunoglobulin infuse short period . As compare IVIG usual dose ( 2gm/kg neuromuscular disease ) infuse 2 - 5 day , dose SCIG would require 3 - 4 week administer currently available formulation . This may mean delayed onset peak-dose effect SCIG may feasible MG patient rapidly worsen MG crisis . Nevertheless , SCIG may attractive option large subpopulation MG patient mild moderate disease exacerbation maintenance IVIG therapy provide efficacy , tolerability feasibility determine patient population . Methodology Participants moderate worsening MG symptom ( MGFA Class II III ) consider appropriate immunoglobulin therapy MG clinic University Alberta screen study treat neurologist . Patients receive 2gm/kg ( 150gm 75kg patient ) 20 % SCIG ( Hizentra ) infuse 4 week dose escalate manner . Participants undergo infusion two four time week , depend tolerance , begin dose 10 ml per site four injection site , increase 5 ml per week total 25 ml per site four injection sit four week . The dose flexible vary base patient 's tolerance medication total amount medication patient receive base body weight . The initial ( one two ) dos infuse within medical outpatient facility University Alberta Hospital . This allow observation infusion reaction also serve nurse-provided self- infusion training session patient . Participants assess weekly symptomatic change report satisfaction quality life . The primary outcome variable change Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis ( QMG ) Score Disease Severity baseline day 42 ( 6 week ) . A change 3.5 point consider clinically significant . Safety pharmacokinetic assessment SCIG perform weekly throughout study . Additionally , study assess feasibility employ SCIG alternative therapy IVIG patient MG exacerbation . The cost-effectiveness SCIG versus IVIG evaluate , impact SCIG therapy assess health-resource perspective patient perspective . The practicality use SCIG patient MG determine document number patient able trained self- administration SCIG , patient ' self-reported satisfaction SCIG treatment . The speed SCIG treatment onset also assess compare IVIG treatment onset . All describe measure use determine feasibility practicality use SCIG patient MG exacerbation impact healthcare system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients between18 80 year age , diagnose MG ( see ) worsen myasthenic symptom ( define increase diplopia , ptosis , dysarthria , dysphagia , difficulty chewing , limb weakness severe enough warrant immunoglobulin therapy . MG diagnosis base upon clinical evaluation neuromuscular expert meeting two follow supportive criterion : 1 . Abnormal Tensilon test 2 . Abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation study 3 . Abnormal single fiber electromyography ( EMG ) 4 . Increased serum acetylcholine receptor antiMuSK antibodies 5 . Prior response immunotherapy 1 .

Known immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency 5 . Pregnant breast feed woman 6 . Active renal hepatic insufficiency , clinically significant cardiac disease 7 . Patients worsen weakness associate infectious process 8 . Previous lack responsiveness IVIG 9 . History previous MG crisis</criteria>
