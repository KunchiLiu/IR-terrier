	<brief_summary>The study test efficacy hour long , one-on-one , active listen counseling session ( call Change Cycle CTC ) aim reduce behavior among active people inject drug ( PWID ) research find facilitate uptake injection drug use among non-injectors . The study involve ~1,100 PWID randomize CTC equal attention control intervention improve nutrition . Participants recruit Los Angeles San Francisco , California follow 6 12 month determine change direct indirect facilitation injection initiation among non-injectors .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Change Cycle : An RCT Prevent Injection Initiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal conduct large-scale randomize control trial ( RCT ) `` Change Cycle '' ( CTC ) intervention . CTC hour long , single-session , one-on-one intervention aim reduce injection initiation encourage active PWID promote drug injection , model injection behavior , describe inject , assist injection initiation non-injectors . CTC use Information-Motivation-Behavioral skill ( IMB ) model achieve change among active PWID seven short module . Information motivational domain address guided conversation ( 1 ) first injection episode consequence , ( 2 ) past experience initiate injection-naive people consequence , ( 3 ) health , legal , social risk related injection drug , ( 4 ) health , legal , social risk initiate people , ( 5 ) identify behavior might promote injection among others . The behavioral skill address ( 6 ) skill-building discussion consideration common initiation scenario , ( 7 ) safer injection education . Aim 1 : To test efficacy CTC reduce number non-injectors initiated injection ( count ) PWID . Hypothesis 1 : PWID receive CTC report initiate few non-injectors drug injection 6 12 month compare PWID control condition . Aim 2 : To test efficacy CTC reduce number time PWID ask initiate ( count ) someone injection . Hypothesis 2 : PWID receive CTC report ask few time initiate someone drug injection 6 12 month compare PWID control condition . Aim 3 : To test whether injection initiation social learning risk ( inject front , describe injection , speak positively injection non-injectors ) act mediational mechanism efficacy CTC intervention initiation request-to-initiate outcome . Hypothesis 3 : Social learn variable significantly mediate association CTC intervention episode initiate request initiate someone drug injection 6 12 month . To achieve aim , active PWID ( N=1,076 ) randomly assign receive CTC equal attention control condition Los Angeles ( LA ) San Francisco ( SF ) , CA . Injection initiation injection initiation social learning variable collect baseline , 6 month , 12 month use computer-assisted personal-interviewing ( CAPI ) . The equal attention control condition focus improve nutrition , specifically increase fresh water intake protein consumption , replicate CTC length , theoretical foundation ( IMB ) , modality ( 1 1 personal session ) . Changes propose : We make 3 modest change study procedure . 1 ) We include active PWID age 17 study . We originally propose exclude subject report injection initiation risk behavior ( e.g. , describe injection , speak positively injection , inject front non-injectors ) injection initiation assistance last 6 month . However , consistency behavior unknown PWID previously report behavior may initiate . For instance , Strike et al. , 2014 , 16 % PWID inject front non-injectors follow-up interview , baseline . Excluding participant baseline injection initiation risk may result miss important intervention effect ( i.e. , expect control condition participant higher incidence/uptake injection initiation risk compare experimental condition participant ) would implement community setting . This change overall number PWID screen estimate 1,700 ~1,100 . The reduction overall participant allow u make change number 2 . 2 ) We use CAPI rather audio-computer assist self-interviewing ( ACASI ) . While ACASI well document advantage , think complexity behavior explore require clarification easily provide via self-interview even audio component . Cost saving reduce number screen participant allow u hire interviewer conduct survey . And 3 ) originally propose equal attention control condition focus sex risk reduction . However , last study PWID Los Angeles San Francisco , find 30 % participant sexual contact last 6 month 34 % one partner suggest sex risk reduction maybe limited interest relevance PWID sample . Instead , focus improve nutrition equal attention control . Based prior study ( Schmitz et al. , 2016 ) , find food insecurity high among PWID ( 57 % PWID low low food insecurity ) . Our participant low income ( 81 % report monthly income less $ 1,351 ) largely homeless ( 62 % ) ; focus strategy improve eat behavior seem highly appropriate population , yet rarely explore .
