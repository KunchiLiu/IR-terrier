	<brief_summary>METHODS : Subjects : All internal medicine ( IM ) , emergency medicine ( EM ) , anesthesia ( A ) , surgery ( S ) resident hospital ICU nurse ( approximately 400 subject ) undergo evaluation training CPR technique accord department training policy . Study Assessment Tool : An objective assessment tool develop tested medical code scenario train session recently do simulation lab . The tool five domain : Airway , Breathing , Circulation , Communications/Leadership , Defibrillation . Each domain consist 3-8 task skill ( attachment A ) . Design : - Phase I : In group five six subject , resident nurse undergo baseline assessment CPR techniques simulation lab . Subject present clinical scenario include cardiopulmonary arrest . Subjects score observer base previously describe assessment tool video record . - Phase II : All study subject complete phase I assessment undergo standardized debrief demonstration proper CPR technique review individual baseline videotape follow repeat demonstration CPR techniques clinical scenario cardiopulmonary arrest simulation lab . Knowledge retention assess periodically . - Phase III : Rates survival hospital discharge survival 24 hour hospitalize patient cardiopulmonary arrest collect CPR committee QA department longitudinally one year completion project training ( phase II ) review compare period one year earlier ( CPR outcome data collect since 2005 St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospitals ) .</brief_summary>
