	<brief_summary>Gastro-intestinal graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) major source morbidity mortality amongst allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( Allo-HSCT ) . The diagnosis base histological finding involve colonic biopsy risk bleeding , especially case thrombocytopenia . Moreover diagnosis frequently make clinical stage disease , appearance gastro-intestinal symptom . Endo-microscopy novel endoscopic technique allow `` optical biopsy '' conventional endoscopy prove efficiency several indication . In pilot study investigator show good sensibility sensitivity compare histology gold standard . Therefore study aim identify endo-microscopic criterion allow early diagnosis GHVD clinical manifestation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose mini-invasive alternative technique perform biopsy terminal part colon rectosigmoidoscopy alone . Confocal laser endomicroscopy , either use endoscope-based probe base technology , aim decrease number standard biopsy associate risk , provide real-time situ microscopy . In previous pilot study perform 15 patient University hospital Nantes , investigator suggest combine probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) wireless capsule endoscopy ( WCE ) could detect early mucosal abnormality suggestive GVHD thus part mini-invasive algorithm early detection GI-GVHD . However , study , investigator show pCLE sensitive method early diagnosis GVH sensibility 85 % specificity 71.5 % . These interesting result however put question due several reason . First pCLE criterion use define GVHD study establish data stem literature validate indication MIAMI score diagnosis malignant biliary structure therefore turn relevant expect . Secondly interpretation image obtain pCLE interpret single endoscopist way n't blind macroscopic appearance eventual lesion rectosigmoidoscopy result bias . Thirdly number patient pilot study probably sufficient evaluate real sensibility sensitivity new indication technique early diagnosis GVH . All together observation lead u necessity develop promising result obtain previously allow realization creation innovate pCLE score : E-mage score . The different criterion score establish one define pilot study review expert committee combine anatomo-pathologists endoscopists objective possible quantitative semi-quantitative assessment focus particularly crypt architecture , morphologic dynamic criterion fluorescein leakage cut stand GVHD , likely GVHD certain GVHD .</detailed_description>
