	<brief_summary>The microcirculation alter acute kidney injury chronic kidney disease . The microcirculation poor end-stage renal disease patient receive hemodialysis . Kidney transplant improve life quality patient . However , surgical stress inflammatory response may cause microcirculatory dysfunction intestinal injury . Moreover , transplant kidney would suffer ischemia reperfusion injury , may result acute kidney injury . In ischemia reperfusion injury animal model , dexmedetomidine proven attenuate kidney intestinal injury . In previous study surgical stress pain stimulation rat model , find dexmedetomidine attenuate intestinal microcirculatory dysfunction . In patient receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery , dexmedetomidine increase urine output decrease postoperative serum level neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin . This study aim investigate whether perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion may attenuate microcirculatory dysfunction , kidney injury , intestinal injury patient undergo kidney transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The microcirculation alter acute kidney injury chronic kidney disease . The microcirculation poor end-stage renal disease patient receive hemodialysis . Kidney transplant improve life quality patient . However , surgical stress inflammatory response may cause microcirculatory dysfunction intestinal injury . Moreover , transplant kidney would suffer ischemia reperfusion injury , may result acute kidney injury . In ischemia reperfusion injury animal model , dexmedetomidine proven attenuate kidney intestinal injury . In previous study surgical stress pain stimulation rat model , find dexmedetomidine attenuate intestinal microcirculatory dysfunction . In patient receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery , dexmedetomidine increase urine output decrease postoperative serum level neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin . The aim study investigate whether perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion may attenuate microcirculatory dysfunction , kidney injury , intestinal injury patient undergo kidney transplant . This randomized , single-blind , prospective , control clinical trial . The patient randomly assign control group dexmedetomidine group . After induction anesthesia , patient control group receive regular perioperative care . The patient dexmedetomidine group receive perioperative dexmedetomidine continuous intravenous infusion induction anesthesia till 2 hour end operation . All patient receive sublingual microcirculation examination , laser speckle contrast image measurement transplant kidney surface microvascular blood flow intensity , laboratory test blood urine nitrogen , creatinine , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serum level endocan , diamine oxidase , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin preset time point . The urine level neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin also measure . The vital sign urine output record . The difference two group compare .</detailed_description>
