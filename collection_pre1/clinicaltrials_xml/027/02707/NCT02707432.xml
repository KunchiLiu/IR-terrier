	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , lead cause death United States ( US ) , disproportionately burden rural community . CVD prevalence rate resident rural area ( 13.1 % ) high compare urban area ( 11.2 % ) US.Geographic difference heart disease mortality lead Cosby et al . describe rural `` mortality penalty '' US . The propose setting research report similar trend CVD prevalence , CVD stroke among top three lead cause death . In community health assessment conduct last three year CVD risk factor obesity hypertension among top 10 health priority target county . Compared resident metropolitan area , rural resident higher rate cigarette smoking , obesity , mortality ischemic heart disease , physically inactive . These disparity likely widen ; current rate , estimate 50 % individual US CVD 2030 . Using community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) approach , specific aim study : 1 . Expand sustain coalition community academic stakeholder develop successful CVD risk prevention strategy rural community ; 2 . Conduct mixed-method community need asset assessment base : ) assemble , review ass exist source CVD data ; b ) identification community strengths resource use web-based survey community , faith base , social service healthcare organization ; c ) determine acceptability component CVD risk reduction EBIs community member ' perception possible target intervention use focus group interview ; ) determine specific family influence ( barrier facilitator ) acceptability EBI acceptability ; 3 . Adapt PREMIER , multi-component EBI use intervention mapping ; 4 . Conduct small-scale randomize control trial ass ) efficacy ; , b ) feasibility adaption implement adapt PREMIER rural setting .</detailed_description>
