	<brief_summary>Recovery Roadmap : A Collaborative Multimedia Tool Person-Centered Recovery Planning highly interactive web-based tool provide guidance provider people recovery , promote widespread implementation Person-Centered Recovery Planning ( PCRP ) . The Recovery Roadmap prototype develop test Center Social Innovation ( C4 ) , partnership Yale University 's Program Recovery Community Health ( PRCH ) , Phase I Small Business Innovative Research ( SBIR ) grant fund National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) ( 1R43MH100712 ) . Phase II refine prototype Roadmap streamline content , provide additional handout exercise provider client complete together , expand audio/video vignette case study , add interactive online coach support provider . Phase II also involve robust evaluation Roadmap , use quasi-experimental design fully power trial . Approximately 26 community-based mental health program randomize Recovery Roadmap ( RR ) Illness Management Recovery ( IMR ) condition [ New York study site , practice refer Wellness Self-Management ( WSM ) ] . Participants include provider client , data include one pre-test three post-tests provider client , interview provider administrator , network analytics , administrative client data . This phase culminate dissemination finding preparation Phase III commercialization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Person-Centered Recovery Planning ( PCRP ; also refer Patient-Centered Care Planning ) field-tested intervention design maximize consumer choice ownership treatment recovery process . In Phase I Recovery Roadmap : A Collaborative Multimedia Tool Person-Centered Recovery Planning , research team develop prototype online tool train provider person recovery understand implement PCRP . The tool provide in-depth information include interactive component ( e.g. , video , fillable form , case study ) prepare users partner effectively . The tool pilot test two site ( one receive Recovery Roadmap ; receive tool plus two-day in-person training ) obtain feedback Roadmap determine impact . The purpose Phase II SBIR study expand Recovery Roadmap conduct fully power study determine tool 's effectiveness training provider support people recovery PCRP process . This Phase II study three specific aim : Aim 1 : Expand development Recovery Roadmap tool . During Phase II , research team refine Roadmap improve user experience ( e.g. , include additional video , case study . interactive feature ; add audio ; make change content present ) . In addition , online coach component add provider . Aim 2 : Evaluate Roadmap use quasi-experimental design . Phase II study include fully power trial . Investigators recruit approximately 26 program within large community mental health organization state New York . To control internal validity threat contamination ( provider often share client resource ) , program randomize one two condition : 1 ) Recovery Roadmap , 2 ) Illness Management Recovery ( IMR ) condition . IMR evidence-based practice promotes skill development goal-setting implement regularly northeastern U.S. , make informative comparator . A total 230 provider recruit ( RR n=115 ; IMR n=115 ) , target 200 , oversampling due attrition . Each provider recruit two client participate ( RR n=230 ; IMR n=230 ) , target 400 total , oversampling due attrition . Investigators use mixed method assess provider knowledge , behavior , relationship relate PCRP via survey , standardized instrument , interview , Social Network Analysis . Client PCRP knowledge , recovery outcomes , treatment engagement , provider/client relationship assess via survey , standardized instrument , client administrative data . Investigators also conduct administrator interview . Aim 3 : Disseminate finding prepare commercialization . Findings disseminate conference presentation , peer-reviewed journal article , issue brief . The research team also lay groundwork Phase III develop plan distribute Recovery Roadmap C4 's online learning platform , t3 , large national international audience develop technology staff infrastructure support use tool . Hypotheses ( Aims 1 2 ) : H1 : Providers RR condition show statistically significant improvement PCRP knowledge , skill , provider-client relationship , compare Illness Management Recovery ( IMR ) condition . H2 : Clients serve provider RR condition show statistically significant improvement treatment engagement progress toward goal , compare serve provider IMR condition . H3 : Providers high level connectivity peer online report sustain PCRP practice , compare low connectivity .</detailed_description>
