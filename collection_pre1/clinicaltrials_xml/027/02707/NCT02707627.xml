	<brief_summary>A new era outcomes pediatric burn patient begin burn care continue improve . Unfortunately , complete restoration burn-injured skin may limit development hypertrophic scarring . Treatment ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser therapy one new form scar therapy available . Although laser therapy adopt burn clinician within last several year , early evidence suggests may offer significant benefit . At present , well-designed randomize controlled trial evaluate effectiveness laser therapy improve hypertrophic burn scar child yet conduct . Thus , propose study answer follow research question : In child age 1 18 year hypertrophic burn scar , addition ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser therapy standard scar management effective improve appearance texture scar compare standard scar management alone , measure Vancouver Scar Scale baseline month 12 ? Ultimately , completion study may lead fundamental change standard treatment pediatric hypertrophic burn scar . In addition , study finding also applicable child adult scar result etiology .</brief_summary>
