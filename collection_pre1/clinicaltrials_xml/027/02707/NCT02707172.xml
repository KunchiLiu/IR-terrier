	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate effectiveness remove chemical exposure hand , compare removal efficiency Di- ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( DEHP ) hand hand wash soap water vs. water . In two three-day N-of-1 trial , residual DEHP measure single female adult wash exposed hand soap-and-water water-only . Subsequently , crossover study perform randomly assign another 28 subject equally wash soap-and-water water-only , one receive treatment 24 hr later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Three study , consist two N-of-1 trial one crossover study , use compare effect handwash soap water ( intervention ) handwashing water ( placebo ) phthalate removal hand . The soap plain soap , consist vegetable oil sodium hydroxide . First , recruit one healthy female age 25 yrs participate two N-of-1 trial . In trial , hand would expose DEHP treat either soap intervention placebo three time course three day . The first trial start 15 May 2013 . On day one , subject prewashed hand , allow hand expose designated amount DEHP . She wash water rinse sequentially three separate polyethylene ( PE ) bag , contain 200 mL water collect DEHP residue . One hour later , protocol follow , except expose hand treat soap water instead water ( Figure 1a ) . The water rinse three separate bag remain . The pairs study repeat two subsequent day ( 16 17 May ) . In second N-of-1 trial , also perform three day ( 22-24 May ) , protocol use subject remain three day , except subject underwent intervention first placebo . The water rinsing remain . A randomize 2 Ã— 2 crossover study subsequently conduct June September 2013 . We assign one group 7 female 7 male perform handwash soap water ( intervention ) another group 7 female 7 male perform handwash water ( placebo ) . Briefly , first day , two group wash DEHP expose hand use either soap water water rinse PE bag 200 mL water collect DEHP . After 24 hr , experiment crossed-over two group receive opposite treatment .</detailed_description>
