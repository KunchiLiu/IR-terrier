	<detailed_description>Psychological distress poor quality life common Long Term Conditions ( LTCs ) include Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) . Rates depression 11-21 % people IBD ( pwIBD ) high level anxiety 41 % . Additionally , diagnosis typically occur 15-40 year , educational employment attainment effect symptom medical procedure diarrhoea colonoscopy stressful embarrass . The relapse remitting nature also cause uncertainty fear social integration . Most psychosocial literature IBD focus potential impact stress record prevalence non-modifiable predictor depression anxiety active disease , hospitalisation , surgery ( particularly stoma formation ) unemployment . Less research IBD investigate potentially modifiable factor know related distress quality life LTCs illness perception , social support cop strategy , although one study find similar association IBD . This particular interest due potential behavioural physiological pathway could impact health quality life . Psychosocial intervention IBD date focus stress management Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) reduce distress improve quality life . Although small sample study show small moderate benefit intervention , approach time consume resource intensive group individual therapy . This result low adherence retention due require time commitment , importantly widely applicable NHS due limit available expertise particular , cost . Psychological intervention effective tailor specifically disease-related factor patient ' developmental stage . Such intervention currently lack IBD . An alternative therapist-led intervention promote self-management paper online self-help intervention supplement minimal guided support health care professional . This type support , self-directed intervention cost-effective show strong result target need specific disease . There currently similar self-directed manual IBD available . This type support , self-directed intervention incorporate standard care require , cost-effective potential support pwIBD successfully adjust LTC well clinical quality life outcomes . Although people require intensive psychological therapy debilitate distress , structure support adjust many demand IBD place people could help bridge gap 40-50 % pwIBD show moderate level distress , improve quality life management illness . Sample size justification : A sample size 30 per group line recommendation pilot study aim determine feasibility future efficacy study estimate treatment effect ( power calculation ) estimate rate non-completion intervention . A minimum total sample size 50 ( i.e . 25 per group ) recommend allow precise estimate pool standard deviation post intervention assessment . Increasing number 30 per group allow non-completion 20 % . Furthermore , sample size 30 per group allow acceptably precise estimate non-completion rate ; 95 % confidence interval less +/-11 % completion rate 80 % high . Adults ( &gt; 18 year ) IBD provide information sheet invite participate study . Following informed consent completion baseline questionnaire , participant randomise receive either intervention + treatment usual ( treatment group ) treatment usual ( control group ) . Randomisation complete King 's College London Clinical Trials Unit independently research team researcher remain blind condition . As recommended pilot feasibility study , result mainly descriptive include ; proportion eligible people ; consent rate ; retention rate . The investigator plan use intention-to-treat regression analysis include pre measure covariate . This data allow effect size feasibility determine order adequately power full trial intervention follow-up study . Thematic analysis qualitative feedback data conduct member independent research team .</detailed_description>
