	<brief_summary>DEPEND open-label dosage-masked trial retire cholesterol-lowering drug probucol agent increase availability apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) cognitively intact old person risk Alzheimer 's dementia . Absorption oral probucol variable . In sample 23 cognitively intact person age 55 , DEPEND therefore develop algorithm prescribe individualize dose achieve plasma concentration likely increase availability CSF apoE . These person use individualized dosage 12 month assess longer-term effect drug CSF apoE concentration , monitor closely evidence adverse consequence use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Probucol cholesterol-lowering drug remove market Canada US , remain clinical use Asia . In rodent , probucol increase synthesis availability apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . ApoE protein product polymorphic gene APOE , allelic variation remain strong know risk factor ( age ) Alzheimer 's dementia . Oral Probucol absorb variably . Administration single , fix dose therefore result wide range plasma concentration drug give various individual fix dosage . Limited human data suggest high plasma CSF concentration probucol result stronger increase CSF apoE concentration . The dual aim DEPEND therefore 1 ) develop individualized dose regimen result plasma concentration likely increase CSF apoE concentration 50 % ; 2 ) treat 20 person elevate risk Alzheimer 's dementia , his/her ideal individual dosage , 12 month , observe result change CSF concentration apoE . Simultaneously , subject observe carefully evidence treatment effect cognition probable marker progression pre-clinical Alzheimer 's disease , well safety risk might deter human experimentation drug .</detailed_description>
