	<detailed_description>The management patient admit emergency department ( ED ) require investigative biological parameter help clinician make right diagnosis . Sepsis concern patient infection associate systemic inflammatory response . While inflammatory profile observe many clinical situation ED , challenge characterize patient suspect sepsis real infection . Currently , individual biomarker sepsis sufficiently discriminant . The objective study measure patient suspect sepsis emergency department , combination biomarkers ( cover several distinct pathophysiological pathway ) could provide high specificity sensitivity diagnostic prognostic . The originality study compare patient admit intensive care unit , patient investigate suspected sepsis ED see earlier medical history usually therapeutic intervention ( intravenous fluid , antibiotic , catecholamine ) interfere several biomarkers interest .</detailed_description>
