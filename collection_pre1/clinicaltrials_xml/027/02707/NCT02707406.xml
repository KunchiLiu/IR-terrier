	<brief_title>Non-healing Diabetic Foot Ulcers ( DFU ) Treated With SoC With Without NEOX®CORD 1K</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 114 patient present non-healing diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) locate malleoli ( plantar ) least 4 week duration size least 0.5 cm2 5.0 cm2 plantar wound meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion recruit different trial site . All patient receive sharp debridement remove non-viable tissue follow standard care include sponsor approve standard dress non-adherent wound contact layer , foam pad gauze moderately drain wound , secondary bandage , off-loading device specific plantar wound . Eligible patient return two consecutive visit approximately two week apart assess wound closure . Patients exhibit change le 30 % reduction original surface area target wind two week screen visit follow debridement randomize control group treatment group baseline visit , Week 1 . The control group continue receive standard care treatment group receive standard care NEOX® CORD 1KTM . At weekly visit , wound adequately debrided devitalize necrotic tissue , wound dress replace . For treatment group , application NEOX® CORD 1KTM consider weekly treatment visit follow Investigator 's assessment wound progression . If Investigator determine medically necessary , additional NEOX® CORD 1KTM apply , include Week 12 maximum 10 application . All wound close Week 13 follow additional two consecutive weekly visit approximately confirm closure exit trial . Patients experience closure Week 13 visit follow additional two consecutive visit Week 15 confirm closure . Patients experience wound closure prior Week 13 consider failure complete end study/Withdrawal Visit 15 exit trial . At weekly visit , efficacy assess extent wound closure determine wound surface area volume measure electronic measurement device ( Silhouette® , ARANZ Medical ) , debridement perform , use standardize protocol . After confirmation closure , Visit 15 , patient complete trial . Safety assess clinical laboratory test screen End Study/Withdrawal Visit 15 , adverse event ( AE ) collection , focus physical exam .</detailed_description>
