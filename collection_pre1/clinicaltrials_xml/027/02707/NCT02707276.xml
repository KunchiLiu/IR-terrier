	<brief_title>LFMS : Initial Trial Geriatric Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator previously observe mood improvement participant bipolar depression population age 21-60 . Here investigator hope extend result similar new population , geriatric bipolar depression ( GPD ) . In addition evaluation effect multiple treatment , well observation duration effect delay one week population , investigator assess whether population present noticeable difference tolerance effect . The protocol involve three treatment consecutive day one follow-up visit ; crossover study treatment follow-up repeat one-week washout alternate ( active , sham ) . The mechanisms depression geriatric population may differ young population . In particular , brain structure connectivity change , increase risk comorbid diagnose dementia might confound treatment assessment . In study investigator hope extend finding LFMS general population directly address treatment bipolar depression geriatric population .</detailed_description>
