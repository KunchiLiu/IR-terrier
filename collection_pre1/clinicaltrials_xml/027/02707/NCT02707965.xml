	<detailed_description>This pilot study exploratory research characterize `` generic brittle '' ( GB ) patient identify major cause generic brittleness epilepsy patient sensitive antiepileptic drug ( AED ) formulation change . The primary aim BEEP2b study perform individual pharmacokinetic ( PK ) similarity test brand generic AEDs `` probably GB '' patient ( N=12 ) , select basis GB-defining factor BEEP2a study , order confirm whether factor predictive generic brittle response product switching . The study design involve randomize , double-blind , multiple-dose , complete four-way replicate crossover design one brand one generic compare patient patient 's AED regimen . Associated adverse event ( i.e . seizure side effect ) also assess . Bioequivalence ( BE ) assess . Rather , nine AEDs expect collectively evaluate . Generic brittleness anticipates , individual subject , brand generic may different , depend upon underlying basis generic brittleness . This exploratory research focus understanding individual patient attribute contribute GB , focus either product development comparison specific product .</detailed_description>
