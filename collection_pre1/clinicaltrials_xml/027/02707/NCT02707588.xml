	<brief_title>Tolerance Efficacy Pembrolizumab Cetuximab Combined With RT Patients With Locally Advanced HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A majority HNSCC locally advance commonly treat concomitant chemo-radiotherapy ( CT-RT ) . However , large proportion patient locally advanced stage suitable receive cisplatinum-based chemotherapy ( CT ) concomitant radiotherapy ( RT ) either due age , general and/or medical condition ( ) . An alternative standard treatment establish , combine RT cetuximab . However , CT-RT cetuximab-RT consider standard approach locally advance non operate HNSCC associated poor outcome patient advance T stage ( T4 ) and/or N stage ( &gt; =N2 ) and/or HPV negative tumour . A new promising approach could target immune response . Pembrolizumab high-affinity monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody show antitumor activity melanoma NSCLC . In KEYNOTE-012 ( multi-center , nonrandomized Phase Ib HNSCC ) , Pembrolizumab well tolerate safe serious drug relate AEs report . About 51 % ( 26/51 ) patient decreased tumor burden see HPV ( - ) HPV ( + ) HNSCC . This observation lead hypothesis generate current study Pembrolizumab potentially active drug HNSCC combination Pembrolizumab radiotherapy well tolerate , give good toxicity profile drug improve outcome patient locally advance HNSCC non suitable CT-RT , compare treatment reference combine cetuximab RT .</detailed_description>
