	<brief_summary>Choroidal nevomelanocytic lesion high prevalence affect 7 % entire population increasingly incidentally identify routine eye check- ups community optometry service . Given tendency err side caution , evidence excessive referral challenge service delivery tertiary eye unit specialist ocular oncology service . Although previous study examine natural history risk factor growth choroidal nevomelanocytic lesion , optimal delivery management remain uncertain . Management approach display diversity respect number type baseline investigation , duration frequency monitor relevant patient . Utilisation skills allied health professional appropriate case would allow streamline service delivery socialise healthcare system , maximise capacity , allow community service play enhanced role . However , evidence model delivery lacking . Within exist model care lesion , patient face delay , need one attendances hospital increase anxiety around prognosis . This project aim answer question whether low-risk , bland incidental finding might possibly manage allied health professional use clinical imaging specific algorithm make appropriate management decision . We aim validate model service delivery virtual basis accommodate capacity pressure accept relevant referral , offer safe service optimise patient experience care . We thus validate set virtual choroidal nevomelanocytic clinic term safety patient acceptability . More specifically , degree agreement management decision make non-medical grader basis image data alone oppose gold standard decision ( clinical imaging test combine ) examine . Health economics analysis propose service delivery model undertaken demonstrate cost-effectiveness .</brief_summary>
