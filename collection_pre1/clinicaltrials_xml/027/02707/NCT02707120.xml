	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Plasma Rich Growth Factors ( PRGF-Endoret ) Eye-drops Treatment Neurotrophic Keratitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal treatment neurotrophic keratitis prevent progression corneal damage , maintain eye structure improve transparency cornea . Therapy initiate early base clinical stage disease depend epithelial state degree corneal hypoesthesia . Plasma rich growth factor ( PRGF-Endoret ) represent new technology use autologous protein , growth factor biomaterials therapeutic formulation different regenerative purpose . Under strict pharmaceutical development , possible develop biologically stable eye drop , show useful treat diverse ocular surface disease . PRGF-Endoret eye drop could alternative therapy patient NK , thus objective clinical trial demonstrate possible efficacy safety patient NK stag 2 3 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 18 . With neurotrophic keratitis stag 2 3 affect one eye . Persistent epithelial defect corneal ulcer least 2 week duration resistant one traditional nonsurgical treatment . Corneal sensitivity reduction test area persistent epithelial defect corneal ulcer defect area least one corneal quadrant . No objective clinical evidence improvement two week prior enrollment . Patients previously read sign informed consent . Patients neurotrophic keratitis stag 2 3 affect eye . With active ocular infection inflammation relate neurotrophic keratitis Any eye disease require topical ocular treatment affect eye study . Patients severe vision loss Patients severe blepharitis and/or severe Meibomian gland disease History eye surgery three month prior enter study , patient plan undergo surgery . Having receive previously surgical procedure treatment NK . Use therapeutic contact lenses refractive correction study . Patients punctual occlusion insertion punctual plug previous study Evidence corneal ulcer affect corneal stroma cornea perforation . Presence disorder ocular systemic disease could limit treatment effectiveness evaluation , Any need change ( time plan ) dose systemic drug know disrupt function trigeminal nerve Known hypersensitivity procedural compound ( eg . fluoresceine ) . Presence blood disorder associate platelet disorder clot , receive anticoagulant drug antiplatelet agent . Patients positive result one serological test syphilis , Hepatitis BC AIDS I / II . Patient current treatment pathology already well manage . Use investigational drug within 4 week prior screen visit . Pregnant woman intend pregnant . Participating another clinical trial .</criteria>
