In context limited access care , finding point need identify cost-effective delivery-vehicles increase treatment engagement outside clinician session . Further , identify neuroscience base biomarkers ( neuromarkers ) underlie key theoretical aspect BA ( i.e. , reward sensitivity ) , relation heterogeneity BA treatment response among substance user depression , critical identification accurately targeted intervention .</detailed_description>
