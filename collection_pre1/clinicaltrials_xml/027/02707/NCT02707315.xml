	<brief_title>A Study Pre-Operative Cyberknife Patients With Potentially Resectable Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate role neoadjuvant chemotherapy CyberKnife therapy increase number patient able successfully undergo definitive surgical management pancreatic carcinoma . In addition , evaluate associate therapeutic toxicity gather data regard quality life indicator similar time interval improve overall assessment effect course treatment patient . Surgery deem curative technique pancreatic cancer . Unfortunately , 80 % patient present disease cure resection . The literature report median survival resectable patient order 19 month , 20 % 5 year survival rate . For patient unable undergo surgical resection , median survival literature approximately 11 month . In absence propose protocol , patient population would treat per standard care locally advance non-metastatic surgically unresectable pancreatic malignancy , would include combination chemotherapy radiation therapy . The anticipated Grade 4 toxicity would approximately 3-5 % regimen . The rate G 4 toxicity know use neoadjuvant regimen , , therefore , constitute major risk associate protocol therapy . The associated benefit , however , anticipated improvement median survival patient may derive ability successfully undergo surgical resection . A secondary propose benefit potential reduction treatment associate toxicity alter multimodality schedule compare traditional multimodality care non-surgical care locally advance pancreatic malignancy .</detailed_description>
