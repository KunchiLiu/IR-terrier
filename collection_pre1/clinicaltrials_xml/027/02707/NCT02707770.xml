	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) exercise program tailor patient chronic lung disease core part management patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Many COPD patient develop low oxygen level ( desaturation ) exercise often discover evaluated PR . Current practice administer oxygen COPD patient exercise-induced desaturation , base limited evidence . This limited evidence relate short-term increase exercise capacity know translates longer term increase activity whether provide patient oxygen improves outcomes PR . In addition know patient give ambulatory oxygen continue use complete PR . Evidence beneficial effect oxygen would provide solid evidence base use . Conversely demonstration effect would allow reassessment use oxygen whether cost justify . Therefore aim study assess effect oxygen outcome PR ass usage ambulatory oxygen follow completion PR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Ambulatory Oxygen Improving Effectiveness Pulmonary Rehabilitation COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomise , single-blinded study compare oxygen air Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient undergo Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) . The study subject patient confirm diagnosis COPD accept PR hypoxemic rest , exercise-induced desaturation ( defined fall oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) ≥4 % least &lt; 90 % , fall SaO2 &lt; 90 % ) demonstrate positive improvement use ambulatory oxygen per British Thoracic Society 2015 Oxygen guideline . It standard practice patient assessment prior commence PR part assessment flow rate require increase SaO2 ≥90 % exercise determine . Patients recruit PR program imperial college health care trust hospital . The subject randomise receive either oxygen flow rate determine initial assessment maximum flow rate 6 litre per minute , room air . The subject undergo standard program PR 6 - 8 week undergo reassessment . 20 patient require group detect 30 % effect size 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) 80 % power 5 % significance level 29 patient group detect 25 % effect 80 % power . Therefore minimum 20 patient per group include . Baseline assessments prior commence PR include symptom quality life assessment include Borg scale assessment breathlessness , Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire ( CRQ ) , COPD Assessment Tool ( CAT ) Hospital Anxiety Depression score ( HAD ) . A 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) carry widely use well validated tool measure exercise capacity . A handheld dynamometer use obtain detailed measure quadriceps muscle strength . In addition measure activity home PR use pedometer never investigate previously.These simple device attach patient count number step day therefore provide estimate activity home environment . A yamax Digi-walker SW-200 pedometer use count number step take per day . Patients instruct wear device leave side body time , except sleep shower . Pedometer placement standardise place belt waistband , midline thigh , consistent manufacturer recommendation study conduct previously . Patients record daily step count daily diary card final follow . The measure exercise capacity follow assessment carry oxygen carry observer blind whether receive oxygen PR . All patient provide ambulatory oxygen domiciliary use complete PR . All patient repeat assessment 8 12 week completion PR . At visit data also collect activity , number exacerbation hospitalisation ongoing usage ambulatory oxygen . The hypothesis use oxygen select patient improves exercise capacity PR . The measurable aim exercise capacity on-going usage oxygen patient group . Primary Objective Assess effect ambulatory oxygen outcome Pulmonary Rehabilitation Secondary Objectives 1 . Assess proportion patient wish continue use ambulatory oxygen . 2 . Assess usage ambulatory oxygen follow completion Pulmonary Rehabilitation 3 . Assess whether initiation ambulatory oxygen PR influence adherence usage 8 12 week .</detailed_description>
