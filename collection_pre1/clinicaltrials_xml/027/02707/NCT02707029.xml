	<brief_summary>Background : Researchers want good understand pain study people without different kind pain . To , researcher expose people pleasant unpleasant sensation . They ask question pain . Researchers also want see people eligible research study National Center Complementary Integrative Health . Objectives : To study experience pain . Also find people eligible join NIH study . Eligibility : People 12 year old without pain disorder . Design : Participants screen phone . Participants one require visit . This may include : - Medical history - Physical exam - Questionnaires pain experience - Blood urine test - MRI : They lie table slide cylinder . They feel different sensation complete task computer . This last 15 minute 2 hour . - Quantitative sensory testing : They expose different picture , sound , taste , smell . They also expose pleasant unpleasant sensation . These could include : - Burning , itch , cold sensation - Pinpricks - Pressure pinch - Electrocardiogram : Stickers chest record heart activity . - Straps place around chest measure breathe . - Small sensor finger palm measure pulse sweating . Over next 3 month , participant may 4 study visit . These last 2 4 hour . They include repeat test require visit . Participants may record visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study allow deep , broad , target phenotyping person pain disorder healthy volunteer . This protocol enable NCCIH investigator describe clinical aspect pain disorder , collect scientific measurement purpose make deep phenotypic description , use collect data perform descriptive analysis pain disorder . The study also facilitate obtain information relevant determine person potentially eligible participate research protocol NIH , particular Laboratory Clinical Investigation ( LCI ) National Center Complementary Integrative Health ( NCCIH ) . The specific goal protocol follow : Research : - To enable clinical description phenotyping research volunteer , particular pain disorder . - To facilitate obtain information relevant determine potential eligibility consent volunteer participate IRB-approved NIH protocol focus pain related disorder . - To perform descriptive analysis painful experience within discrete pain disorder . Study Population : The study population consist 5,000 person pain disorder 5,000 healthy volunteer , seek participate research protocols NIH , primarily sponsor NCCIH Division Intramural Research investigator . Human being adolescence age older ( great equal 12 year ) willing provide assent and/or consent may participate study . This protocol open volunteer ethnicity , gender , nationality . Design : The protocol design cross-sectional observational study . Participants initially undergo informed consent process core phenotyping evaluation , include clinical evaluation Licensed Independent Practitioner questionnaire . Following core evaluation , participant may undergo select scientific measurement phenotyping purpose . Phenotyping measurement occur course several month . On completion phenotyping measurement , participant discharge protocol . After completion , past participant may contact undergo re-evaluation appropriate . Outcome Measures : The study use wide variety measurement tool phenotyping purpose . These include : vital sign , medical history , physical exam , medical record review , qualitative pain interview , patient report outcome measurement , psychophysical behavioral measurement , clinical laboratory measurement , structural functional imaging assessment use magnetic resonance imaging , psychophysical measurement . In summary , NCCIH phenotyping protocol enable investigator obtain detailed clinical description collect phenotyping measurement research volunteer , particular pain disorder . It collect information research volunteer , consent , use determine potential eligibility IRB-approved protocol . The study allow NCCIH investigator perform descriptive research pain disorder use hypothesis generation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Are great equal 12 year age Are able provide appropriate inform consent and/or inform assent appropriate EXCLUSION CRITERIA Have difficulty communication make subjective pain assessment impossible unreliable . Have active medical psychiatric health issue create additional substantial adverse risk relate study procedure . Medical example acute complication medical disease , asymptomatic hypertensive urgency , diabetic ketoacidosis , symptomatic hyperthyroidism , unstable angina . Psychiatric example acute complication psychiatric disease , acute mania , paranoid delusion , active panic attack . Are participate ongoing research protocol phenotypic measurement would interfere conduct ongoing protocol receipt research treatment would influence phenotypic measurement . Employees staff work NCCIH .</criteria>
