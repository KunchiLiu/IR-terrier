	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether recombinant human thrombopoietin ( rhTPO ) rapidly increase platelet count , shorten time platelet return normal , reduce platelet transfusion bleed event , decrease length ICU stay , eventually reduce 28-day mortality septic shock patient thrombocytopenia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin Septic Shock With Thrombocytopenia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis high morbidity mortality critical care unit . Clinically , find secondary thrombocytopenia common patient septic shock , incidence high 55 % . Moreover , many study show thrombocytopenia early prognostic marker septic shock independent risk factor mortality septic shock . And , report early recovery thrombocytopenia help prevent coagulopathy decrease mortality . At present , management sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia mainly platelet transfusion platelet-increased drug . Because source scarcity , transfusion-related infectious immunological complication , platelet transfusion limit clinical treatment . So , use platelet-increased drug replacement therapy become inevitable trend . The primary purpose study explore effect platelet-increased drug ( rhTPO ) 28-day mortality among septic shock patient thrombocytopenia . The study design prospective , multi-center , open-label , , randomize , placebo-controlled study 5 tertiary academic medical center medical , surgical general ICUs . Patient enrollment expect last 42 month . They randomly assign 1:1 ratio two group . Both group receive appropriate medical support treatment base guideline issue survive sepsis campaign . The intervention group receive rhTPO dose 15000u/d , subcutaneous injection , 7 consecutive day . It terminate platelet count ( PCs ) increase 50×10^9/L 3 consecutive day compare PCs baseline , PCs 100×10^9/L , duration rhTPO 7 day . Time randomization administration rhTPO within 24 hour . The control group use platelet-increased drug . Platelet transfusion advise administer PCs 10×10^9/L absence apparent bleed 20 ×10^9/L patient significant risk bleed two group . Patients follow 28 day . PCs monitor every day 14 day , follow test twice week . Liver renal function , coagulation function , inflammatory biomarkers ( CRP , PCT ) , severity disease ( SOFA , APACHEǁ ) monitor treatment , follow test twice week . And , number platelet transfusion , length ICU stay , day free advanced cardiovascular/respiratory/ renal support , bleed event , adverse effect record treatment .</detailed_description>
