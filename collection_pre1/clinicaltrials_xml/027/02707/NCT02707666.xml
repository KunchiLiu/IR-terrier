	<brief_summary>This single institution , single-arm , window opportunity pilot trial pembrolizumab patient resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma . All patient undergo pretreatment PET/CT scan clinical stag VATS procedure acquire pretreatment tissue . Three cycle pembrolizumab administer ( 200 mg IV every 21 day ) . A PET/CT scan repeat assess response pembrolizumab surgical resection perform via extended/pleurectomy decortication least 4 week third dose pembrolizumab . Standard adjuvant chemotherapy consist cisplatin pemetrexed 4 cycle ( every 21 day ) give start 6-8 week follow surgery , new baseline CT scan obtain . Restaging CT scan obtain assess response every two cycle chemotherapy . After completion standard chemotherapy , optional adjuvant treatment pembrolizumab give eligible patient 1 year post-surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . To determine rate induction Gamma-Interferon Gene Expression profile ( GEP ) use CLIA Nanostring nCounter base assay ( perform Merck 's CLIA laboratory ) patient malignant pleural mesothelioma treat pembrolizumab 2 . To determine safety feasibility neoadjuvant pembrolizumab patient malignant pleural mesothelioma . Exploratory Objectives 1 . To determine 1-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat pembrolizumab via multimodality approach ( include neoadjuvant pembrolizumab , extend pleurectomy/decortication , adjuvant pemetrexed/cisplatin applicable adjuvant pembrolizumab ) . 2 . To determine median overall survival ( OS ) MM patient treat pembrolizumab via multimodality approach ( include neoadjuvant pembrolizumab , extend pleurectomy/decortication , adjuvant pemetrexed/cisplatin applicable adjuvant pembrolizumab ) . 3 . To determine 1-year PFS , disease free survival ( DFS ) OS PD-L1 positive TCIP-positive MM patient treat multimodality approach . 4 . To determine safety adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment surgery adjuvant chemotherapy 5 . To determine objective response rate single-agent pembrolizumab via PET/CT previously untreated MM patient , correlate response change immune microenvironment .</detailed_description>
