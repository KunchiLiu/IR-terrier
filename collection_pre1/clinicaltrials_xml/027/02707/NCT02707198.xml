	<brief_title>Prevention Clostridium Difficile-associated Diarrhea Daily Intake Kefir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance Clostridium difficile infection great concern hospital nationwide C. difficile remain common nosocomial infection North America . The majority patient C. difficile infection respond orally administer metronidazole vancomycin , 5-30 % patient go develop recurrent infection diarrhea , despite antibiotic treatment . The idea gut microbiota influence susceptibility recovery disease become widely report . Disruption normal bacterial flora gut systemic antibiotic use attribute uncontrolled growth bacteria otherwise suppress C. difficile . Even antibiotic regimen conclude , restoration normal gut microbiota think paramount interrupt cycle C. difficile infection . The idea reintroduce normal microbial flora patient recurrent C. difficile infection foundation upon use probiotic agent , include fecal transplant , introduce . The use probiotic treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea , specifically C. difficile infection , study success report , particular group . The emerge idea , however , probiotic consumption use prevent onset C. difficile infection , require study . Meta-analyses conduct previously report data ultimately conclude use probiotic safe effective . However , remain need focus control study assess efficacy kefir consumption incidence C. difficile infection St. Luke 's Hospital Duluth , MN , CHI Creighton University Medical Center Omaha , NE . The data collect study potential change clinical practice institution , hospital institution population patient undergoing systemic antibiotic treatment . Risk factor persistent C. difficile infection include age great 65 year , poor nutritional status , recent abdominal surgery , prolong hospitalization recent stay ICU . The purpose study determine administer daily regimen kefir at-risk patient reduce incidence C. difficile infection . Because treatment C. difficile infection difficult expensive , recurrent infection common , way prevent infection great interest . A preventive measure reduce incidence diarrhea C. difficile infection clearly improve patient health , multi-fold impact patient care hospital well post-discharge . There potential cost-saving , well , form direct cost antibiotic treatment prolong hospital stay . Additionally , cost time effort prevent spread infection reduce , well , ultimately improve patient care . Preliminary Studies Many study publish indicate potential probiotic prophylaxis diarrhea associate antibiotic use human . Additionally , recent report rodent model suggest kefir consumption concomitantly antibiotic treatment may prevent development C. difficile-associated diarrhea . However , knowledge study publish investigated preventive effect kefir consumption specifically relate C. difficile infection human patient . This protocol serve initial study subset at-risk patient data collect provide guidance future study include broad range at-risk patient . Research Design Methods Subjects The study include patient prescribed systemic antibiotic kind ( administered oral parenteral route ) , yet begin treatment regimen . There three study group : - Group A : Patients receive antibiotic receive kefir - Group B : Patients receive antibiotic receive kefir hospital stay - Group C : Patients receive antibiotic receive kefir follow discharge duration antibiotic regimen , maximum 30 day All patient receive journal track kefir intake ( Group C ) loose stool diarrhea 30 day hospital stay . Additionally , patient receive follow-up phone call 3-5 day discharge hospital , weekly thereafter 30 day , determine diarrhea occur . All patient instruct call physician symptom diarrhea occur . The aim study determine incidence antibiotic-associated diarrhea study group well presence C. difficile stool patient report diarrhea . Data Collection Accrual Methods Patients meet inclusion criterion consent part study assign one three study group random . During standard admission interview , patient ask allergy , include milk protein allergy . This type allergy exclude patient participate study . Because kefir 99 % lactose free , lactose intolerance exclude individual participate . Per standard care , physical exam perform symptom-directed exam perform follow-up appointment , typically one month discharge hospital . Patients study group consume kefir receive information card include nutrition fact 4-ounce serve kefir . Lifeway brand Kefir® use widely available come several palatable flavor . The probiotic content Lifeway Kefir remain constant , regardless flavor . Patients Group A receive prescribed antibiotic hospital stay receive kefir . These patient instruct consume yogurt , kefir , probiotic product hospital stay 30 day post-discharge . Patients Groups B C begin receive kefir day prescribe antibiotic regimen begin . Four ounce kefir administer 3 time day patient enrol study . A 4 oz . glass kefir provide every mealtray , nursing staff participate institution administer kefir patient . The amount kefir consume patient record nursing staff enter electronic medical record . Four ounce standard serve yogurt well-tolerated patient . This serve size help maintain ongoing live probiotic culture individual receive kefir . For patient Group B , administration kefir nursing staff continue duration patient ' hospital stay . For patient Group C , kefir prescribe dose give hospital stay ( least 4 ounce kefir 3 time day , exceed 12 ounce per day ) . All patient give journal record symptom C. difficile infection ( i.e. , diarrhea ) . Additionally , patient Group C record kefir consumption daily basis . All patient receive follow-up phone call 3 day hospital discharge weekly thereafter 30 day ( total 4 phone call ) . Patients ask incidence diarrhea order nursing staff physicians assess C. difficile infection occur . All patient ask contact physician experience diarrhea hospital stay . These patient offer fecal C. difficile test , per standard care . Any patient 3 watery stool 24 hour period positive C. difficile stool test consider C. difficile infection . Stool collection test carry per treatment guideline . No type C. difficile isolates perform sample obtain beyond scope study . Patients develop C. difficile infection study immediately treat per standard care consider treatment failure . However , patient contact follow-up information pertinent study ( i.e. , duration symptom , efficacy standard treatment ) . Follow contact make via telephone ; initial call make 3 day post discharge hospital patient contact weekly thereafter 30 day . During phone call , patient ask concern symptom , specifically related diarrhea . If point hospitalization follow-up timeframe patient receive kefir display sign symptom invasive bacterial , yeast , fungal infection , blood culture culture deem clinically appropriate ( urine culture , sputum culture , wound culture , etc . ) obtain . Signs symptom invasive infection include , limited , follow : fever , chill , elevate WBC concentration , elevate serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and/or procalcitonin level , hypotension . If suspect invasive infection occur course kefir administration , follow empiric treatment regimen consider : • Intravenous administration vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam plus fluconazole - Intravenous daptomycin use patient previously document vancomycin allergy - An intravenous fluoroquinolone ( ciprofloxacin moxifloxacin ) use patient documented penicillin allergy - Intravenous micafungin use patient document fluconazole allergy Initial intake screen inclusion kefir research study include evaluation know allergy . Antibiotic therapy adjust accordance identification causative organism ( ) correspond antibiotic susceptibility . Treatment duration determine base standard care clinical situation causative organism . Data Analysis The three treatment group compare use logistic regression covariates study location , age , gender , antibiotic type dos , hypoalbuminemia , compromise immune system . Model selection base Akaike Information Criterion use select covariates final model . The treatment group also compare without covariate adjustment . As need , miss data handle use multiple imputation assessment miss random consideration . Dependent independent variable plan analysis include imputation along auxiliary variable think potentially related predict miss data . In addition , order include auxiliary covariates imputation potentially related missingness , logistic regression perform dependent variable missing/not miss . Only imputed value independent variable use analysis . Multiple imputation perform R package mi . The data collect patient journal use monitor compliance antibiotic use , kefir consumption , symptom C. diff infection . These data particularly useful event difference see C. diff infection rate among study group . From self-reported patient data , compliance monitor exclusion study may warrant case non-compliance .</detailed_description>
