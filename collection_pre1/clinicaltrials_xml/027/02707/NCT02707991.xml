	<brief_summary>Effective all-oral medication finally available cure hepatitis C virus , affect 4 million Americans one-in-four people live HIV . However , many barrier exist prevent people HIV/HCV co-infection get curative treatment , include low knowledge , compete demand , drug interaction HIV medication . This study evaluate hepatitis C nurse case management intervention HIV primary care clinic improve patient attendance hepatitis C care help people start hepatitis C treatment earlier . Half participant receive brief case management nurse , half receive usual clinic care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nurse Case Management Improve Hepatitis C Care HIV Co-infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) lead cause liver cancer HCV-related liver disease among common cause non-AIDS related death among people live HIV ( PLWH ) . One quarter PLWH U.S. co-infected HCV , lead 3-fold increase progression end stage liver disease liver cancer . HCV cure , less half PLWH chronic HCV U.S. link HCV care , 7 % initiated treatment . Poor treatment initiation rate historically due low efficacy among PLWH , HCV care turn point . We ability substantially decrease HCV-related morbidity mortality PLWH availability effective all-oral treatment . As patient funnel HCV care , improve process linkage care treatment preparation relate HIV medication modification necessary current HCV regimens essential maximize lifesaving potential available therapy among PLWH . There several barrier linkage HCV care treatment . HCV `` silent epidemic '' often present symptom 20 year . Knowledge HCV available therapy also low lag behind new advancement HCV treatment . Competing work , school caregiving demand also historically lead low motivation engage HCV care . For PLWH link HCV care , drug interaction new HCV therapy HIV treatment regimen introduce new barrier HCV treatment initiation . Up 88 % PLWH need switch HIV treatment regimen avoid contraindicate drug interaction . The April 8 , 2015 Guidelines Use Antiretroviral Agents HIV-1-infected Adults Adolescents emphasize need modify HIV regimens treat HCV many PLWH . But modify HIV treatment regimen severe negative consequence , include decrease quality life , increase symptom burden , loss viral suppression . Interventions increase HCV knowledge support HIV treatment modification set drug interaction need improve linkage HCV care decrease time treatment initiation . In similar setting population , nurse case management intervention show improve outcome . However , intervention rigorously test context HCV . This study randomize , single-blinded control trial test whether nurse case management intervention improve HCV treatment cascade among PLWH HIV primary care set compare usual care . Specifically , study aim : 1 . Test whether nurse case management intervention increase linkage Viral Hepatitis Clinic among person HIV/HCV co-infection compare usual care ; Hypothesis : A high proportion randomize intervention arm attend Viral Hepatitis Clinic within 60 day randomization compare receive usual care . 2 . Determine nurse case management intervention decrease time HCV treatment initiation among person HIV/HCV co-infection compare usual care ; Hypothesis : Those randomize intervention arm decrease time HCV treatment initiation point randomization compare receive usual care . 3 . Describe characteristic associate uptake HCV care among people live HIV , control covariates ; Research question 2.1 : What patient-level characteristic associate increase uptake HCV care ? ; Research question 2.2 : Compared known historical barrier engage HCV care , factor continue associate uptake HCV care new paradigm HCV treatment people live HIV ?</detailed_description>
