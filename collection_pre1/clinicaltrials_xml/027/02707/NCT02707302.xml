	<brief_title>Surgical Adhesive Drapes Prevention Healing Wound Infections After Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical-site infection , include deep-layer superficial-layer wound infection , common complication total hip arthroplasty . Surgical infection lead poor wound heal , increased hospital day , increase patient suffering distress , high cost , even life-threatening event . Wound infection total hip arthroplasty result local pain , joint displacement , reduce joint function . Compared common bacterial infection , bacteria deep layer epidermis total hip arthroplasty adhere metal prosthesis bone cement , may thus escape immune system lack blood supply . Furthermore , immune response contribute formation protective mucus layer prosthesis surface , bacteria mucus layer may protect antibiotic intervention . Preventing surgical-site infection thus important factor determine success total hip arthroplasty . Measures prevent surgical-site infection currently include instrument sterilization , protection aseptic area , use prophylactic antibacterial drug , reduce surgical-wound size use iodophor-impregnated antibacterial adhesive drape also propose reduce infection . Surgical adhesive drape create aseptic area around wound , thus reduce bacterial content infection incidence . Compared conventional iodophor-free polyethylene adhesive drape , iodophor-impregnated polyester surgical adhesive drape breathable scalable , show good compliance , provide good skin adhesion . Iodophor-impregnated adhesive drape attach sterilized surgical site effectively inhibit intraoperative movement bacteria , provide persistent effective protection wound infection total hip arthroplasty . Total hip arthroplasty involves long operation high risk wound infection . Iodophor-impregnated adhesive drape recommend iodophor-impregnated viscose persistently release iodine ion help maintain aseptic skin throughout surgery . Iodophor-impregnated adhesive drape show decrease incidence wound infection show broad-spectrum antibacterial activity several hour , unaffected body fluid blood , compare iodophor-free adhesive drape . Iodophor-impregnated adhesive drape report reduce surgical-site infection orthopedic surgery . However , study report use antibacterial surgical adhesive drape China , though Ling et al . report decreased incidence surgical-site infection . However , despite evidence suggest 3M iodophor-impregnated antibacterial adhesive drape reduce bacteria surgical site , prevent wound infection , promote wound heal . Although effect surgical adhesive drape wound infection extensively study , best knowledge , clinical study compare effect iodophor-impregnated iodophor-free antibacterial adhesive drape wound infection cause bacteria deep layer epidermis . We hypothesize 3M iodophor-impregnated adhesive drape would inhibit bacteria around surgical wound deep layer epidermis total hip arthroplasty , promote wound heal effectively 3M iodophor-free adhesive drape . We aim validate hypothesis single-center , randomize , double-blinded , control clinical trial . Data collection , preservation , monitor Data collect paper case-report form summarize table . The write record transfer electronic format use double-data entry strategy . The trial process monitor professional clinical research associate full access essential document ensure patient safety complete clinical data , include compliance informed-consent procedure , evaluation primary endpoint compliance . In addition regular site visit , clinical research associate also communicate trial center via e-mail phone . If patient ( ) withdraw trial , intention-to-treat analysis relate record perform , otherwise patient 's record delete . The reason patient withdrawal record medical record . Statistical analysis All data analyze statistically use Statistical Product Service Solutions 10.0 software . Quantitative baseline data compare use two-sample t-tests Mann-Whitney U test , qualitative data use χ2 Fisher 's exact probability test . Differences VAS Harris score iodophor-impregnated iodophor-free adhesive drape group evaluate two-sample t-tests . Non-normally distribute data convert comparison primary secondary outcome prior intervention compare group use two-sample t-tests . Bacterial detection rate peri-wound tissue grade I wound-healing rate two group compare χ2 test . A level P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
