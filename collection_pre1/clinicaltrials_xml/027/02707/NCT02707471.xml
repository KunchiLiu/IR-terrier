	<brief_summary>Adjuvant endocrine therapy ( AET ) crucial component treatment use prevent recurrence reduce breast cancer-related mortality breast cancer patient hormone receptor positive disease . Studies report low rate adherence AET ( 38 % 86 % ) preliminary work , 65 % breast cancer patient take AET report one non-adherent medication take behavior ( e.g. , skip dose , forget , adjust dose ) past month . Symptoms ( e.g. , arthralgia , vasomotor symptom ) associate AET strongly relate non-adherence early discontinuation treatment . Poor adherence AET due symptom may compromise effectiveness AET . Prior conduct clinical trial , conduct user test self-management intervention protocol 20 woman . In proposed randomized clinical trial , 400 woman take AET breast cancer randomly assign one two condition : 1 ) self-management intervention improve adherence symptom management , 2 ) general health education control condition . The self-management intervention integrates three key theory-based strategy improve adherence AET : coping skill train managing symptom ( e.g. , arthralgia , vasomotor symptom ) , behavioral strategy improve medication adherence , symptom medication education . The intervention address specific symptom woman experience design meet need woman high risk non-adherence AET ( e.g. , low socioeconomic status , low literacy ) . The self-management intervention administer nurse via telephone , combine use phone call tailor interactive voice message base information exchange phone session real-time adherence data obtain smart medication bottle . Women randomly assign control condition receive general health education intervention deliver nurse via telephone . This study take place Duke Cancer Institute breast clinic community hospital member Duke Cancer Network , allow access woman receive care outside medical center set increase generalizability finding variety setting . Adherence AET assess 18 month period follow study enrollment use wireless smart medication bottle provide real-time adherence data . Patient-reported outcome measure assess symptom , perceive necessity AET , concern AET , self-efficacy obtain baseline 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month . To increase likelihood late implementation self-management intervention , cost effectiveness intervention evaluate .</brief_summary>
