	<brief_title>PIB Versus CI Through Popliteal Sciatic Nerve Catheter Analgesia Following Major Ankle Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral nerve block commonly use upper low limb surgery . Continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block achieve delivery local anesthetic perineural catheter play important role post-operative pain control major orthopedic surgery ankle foot . Factors affect success clinical outcome continuous sciatic nerve block include accuracy catheter placement , local anesthetic dose ( volume concentration ) , infusion method . Methods local anesthetic infusion commonly use peripheral nerve blockade include continuous infusion ( CI ) CI combine patient-controlled analgesic ( PCA ) boluses . A third option , regular intermittent bolus local anesthetic , commonly use usually require manual administration healthcare provider thus time labor-intensive . Recently , however , infusion pump capable provide automate programmed intermittent bolus ( PIB ) dose become available . The premise PIB dose result extensive spread local anesthetic around nerve , thus effective sensory block analgesia . PIB dose regimen extensively study labor epidural analgesia , show decrease local anesthetic consumption improve maternal satisfaction compare continuous infusion regimen . In contrast , little investigation PIB dosing regimen context continuous peripheral nerve blockade . In 2005 , Taboada et al 2 publish study compare automate PIB dose CI dose local anesthetic continuous popliteal sciatic nerve blockade . In regimen , patient also allow administer PCA boluses local anesthetic need improve quality nerve block . The author find automate PIB dose regimen result patient use less local anesthetic few PCA bolus , provide equivalent analgesia . There non-significant trend low pain score PIB group patient . These effect attribute well perineural spread local anesthetic PIB regimen . No study conduct confirm benefit . The reduced local anesthetic requirement particular advantage patient discharge home nerve block catheter situ supply reservoir local anesthetic last longer . Ambulatory infusion pump PIB PCA feature commercially available . The investigator hypothesize PIB+PCA dose regimen use one new ambulatory infusion pump provide effective postoperative analgesia less local anesthetic consumption CI+PCA dose regimen .</detailed_description>
