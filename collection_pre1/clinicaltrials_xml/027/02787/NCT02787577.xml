	<brief_summary>Short sleep duration associate increase risk weight gain development non-communicable disease . Sleep deprivation study suggest link restrict sleep risk adiposity cardiometabolic dysregulation may causal . However , severity acuteness sleep restriction schedule laboratory-based study could hinder ecological validity finding . The pragmatic way forward assess improve sleep habitually short sleeper impact aforementioned outcomes . This study assess feasibility lengthen sleep short sleeper , well improve sleep duration and/or quality impact metabolic health , body composition , energy balance cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Sleep Lengthening Metabolic Health , Body Composition , Energy Balance Cardiovascular Risk Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Questions - Is feasible improve sleep duration quality habitually short sleeper free-living condition ? - What effect improve sleep duration quality body composition , energy balance , dietary intake , cardio-metabolic risk factor ? Hypothesis - Improved sleep duration and/or quality habitually short sleeper result improved energy balance , diet quality , body composition , cardio-metabolic risk profile . Aims - To assess feasibility improve sleep duration and/or quality habitually short sleeper use behavioural approach public health message target sleep hygiene . - To identify improved sleep duration and/or quality affect energy balance , diet quality , body composition , cardio-metabolic risk profile . Objectives 1 . To develop sleep extension strategy use behaviour change technique ( BCTs ) target sleep hygiene . 2 . To recruit healthy adult habitually short sleeper randomise eligible participant intervention control group . 3 . To assess feasibility effectiveness intervention . 4 . To measure energy balance , diet quality , body composition cardio-metabolic risk factor pre- post-treatment intervention control group . 5 . To assess whether intervention effect aforementioned parameter compare intervention endpoint control well baseline measure . 6 . To run statistical analysis intention-to-treat basis well per-protocol .</detailed_description>
