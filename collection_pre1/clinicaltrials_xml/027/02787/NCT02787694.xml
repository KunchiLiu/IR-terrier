	<brief_summary>Locomotor disability remain major obstacle community function stroke survivor . This disability best characterize reduced gait speed enhance risk fall observe majority stroke survivor . Current robotic system focus repetitive stepping constrain , less-challenging environment overground training fail produce result justify use . In contrast approach , study use combinatorial approach move platform ( KineAssist-Mobility Activity Center ) simulate enhances challenge overground training . We focus five critical factor contribute reduce speed fall risk mobility activity : 1 ) low limb weakness ; 2 ) slow low limb movement ; 3 ) reduce balance ; 4 ) reduce ability respond challenge walk ; 5 ) reduce aerobic capacity . The end product study develop comprehensive standardized system assess prescribe specific training modality use clinician help stroke survivor limit slow walk speed high fall risk , improve participation mobility activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Impairment muscle strength important limiting factor determine walk speed stroke . There positive correlation muscle strength maximum gait speed ( i.e . muscle become strong , maximum gait speed increase ) . Also , stroke survivor walk speed range approximately 0.2 m/s 0.8 m/s ask walk comfortable pace . These velocity significantly low age-matched individual ( 1.3 m/s 1.4 m/s ) . Moreover , stroke survivor encourage walk self-selected maximum walk speed achieve walk speed 0.3 m/s 1.3 m/s , suggest stroke survivor limit capability adapt comfortable gait order increase walk speed reach high function . Additionally , individual post-stroke hemiplegia high risk fall due poor balance inability tolerate environmental challenge . We select specific environmental hazard turn current literature related people fall home nonclinical environment . Research identify specific risk factor fall people stroke . Fallers show poor balance , low physical function measure non-fallers , great stand sway , impulsivity , slow response time , addition great postural sway reduce force generation stand sit . Forster Young find faller depress less socially active non-fallers . They find fall occur patient ' home walk transfer . Individuals report loss balance , get foot stick , difficulty perform transfer reason fell . Hyndman et . al , find repeat faller significantly reduce arm function activity daily live ( ADL ) ability compare fall . A review conclude evidence support mix approach mean improve low limb function walk post-stroke . They conclude `` . . . need high quality randomize trial systematic review determine efficacy clearly describe individual technique task-specific requirement . '' However , Duncan Dobkin argue past mobility training approach focus use either body-weight support treadmill train robotic assistive training fail generate result justify use mainstream stroke survivor [ 6 ] . They cite two study particular , SCILT [ 7 ] LEAPS [ 8 ] , produce conclusion supportive extra effort technology necessary implement protocol . One major suggestion author combinatorial approach implement incorporates strength training , aerobic training , balance training . We agree suggestion propose test combinatorial approach study use unique innovative robotic system especially developed combine exercise target force , speed , balance , locomotor challenge within single program . As result previous funding , develop innovative protocol assess treat mobility disability chronic stroke survivor use unique robotic platform . The KineAssist- Mobility Activity Center ( KA-MAC ) , develop HDT Robotics ( partner study ) , use patented force-sensing , pelvic support mechanism sense user 's intend walking speed direction drive move surface , thus allow person move intend speed pace . The device sensitive enough allow sudden start stop movement , balance task responses sudden disturbance accommodate . This system uniquely different compare treadmill , move fix speed allow repetitive stepping protocol . In summary , develop unique innovative robotic system allow individual move self-driven speed challenge condition order implement combinatorial approach assessment intervention .</detailed_description>
