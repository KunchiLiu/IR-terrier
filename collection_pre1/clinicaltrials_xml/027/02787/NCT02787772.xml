	<brief_title>Abdominal Hernia Cirrhotic Patients : Surgery Conservative Treatment ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal wall hernia frequent cirrhotic patient . The incidence umbilical hernia´s reach 20 % compensate cirrhosis even 40 % patient ascites . Several risk factor explain development umbilical hernia patient , , increase intra-abdominal pressure cause ascites ; abdominal aponeurosis weakness due sarcopenia ; recanalization umbilical vein . These hernia develop great hernial sac , especially ascites present . All risk factor also explain high complication rate due development pressure ulcer , skin rupture , ascites leak bacterial peritonitis . Moreover pain common associate symptom . Inguinal hernia also develop due high intra-abdominal pressure due ascites ; often result large hernia sac reach scrotum . In addition large hernia responsible reduce mobility quality life . The ideal treatment would correct abdominal wall hernia underlie liver disease . However , insufficient liver´s donor , liver transplantation ( LT ) wait list continuously grow . This explain majority abdominal wall hernia cirrhotic patient remain untreated several year . Therefore , cirrhotic hernia patient follow conservatively , surgical treatment reserve complication occur . Such expectative attitude explain high postoperative morbidity mortality . Although , urgent surgery patient impose high morbidity mortality compare elective hernia surgery . No prospective study report compare incidence complication cirrhotic hernia patient observe submit elective surgery . The aim study analyze result surgical treatment abdominal wall hernia cirrhotic patient . A prospective study conduct patient documented cirrhosis abdominal hernia follow Department Liver Transplant University São Paulo period January 2009 November 2014 . All patient include study sign informed consent . At moment randomize elective hernia repair clinical follow-up accordingly Child-Pugh ( CTP ) status . Patients develop local hernia complication observation underwent emergency hernia surgery . Cirrhosis diagnose liver test confirm liver image biopsy . Abdominal wall hernia diagnose physical examination ultrasound and/or CT scan necessary . All patient manage liver disease use individualized laboratory test , endoscopic ultrasound work-up . Patients decompensated liver disease medically optimize use diuretic order control ascites . Variables study : age , sex , etiology liver disease , CTP classification , MELD ( model end stage liver disease ) score , ascites , need paracentesis , diabetes mellitus , renal failure abdominal hernia type , morbidity mortality . In patient underwent surgery length hospital stay , post-operative complication , grade complication accordingly Clavien infection also record . Post-operative mortality consider 30-days . End point study death , hernia recurrence LT . This study approve Institutional Review Board University Sao Paulo . Wait see advocated policy study .</detailed_description>
