	<brief_summary>Rationale : Numerous study show positive effect healthy diet regular moderate exercise . Although , exercise also correlate increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) production high incidence injury . ROS production seem induce muscle damage , reduces muscle performance induces fatigue . Increasing muscle recovery could effective way increase exercise performance . Several food ingredient grow interest due specific function human body . Citrus flavonoid abundantly available citrus fruit . Prior study show positive effect citrus flavonoid endothelial function , promote vasodilation . In addition positive effect nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis , know compound regulate endothelial response . This capacity citrus flavonoid could useful stimulate performance recovery exercise . Additionally , ability scavenge ROS could reduce muscle damage cause exercise induce oxidative damage . Objective : Determine 4-week effect daily citrus flavonoid supplementation exercise recovery performance . Study design : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study parallel design , 40 subject engage three exercise session . The session subdivide pre-test test 1 2 . Between test 1 2 , participant receive daily 4 week citrus flavonoid supplement placebo . Each day , subject consume 2 capsule morning , contain total 500 mg citrus flavonoid 500 mg placebo . Study population : The subject healthy normal weight train male , age 18 - 25 . Additionally , subject non-smokers free medication . Intervention : Participants randomly place either citrus flavonoid placebo group . Participants instruct ingest 2 capsule morning 4 consecutive week . Each capsule equal 250 mg citrus flavonoid cellulose case placebo treatment . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter average amount work load produce 10-minute time trail test . In addition , oxygen per minute determine well heart rate . Finally , test , subjective rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) determine pre-test test 1 2 use Borg scale .</brief_summary>
