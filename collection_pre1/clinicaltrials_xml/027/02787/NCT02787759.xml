	<brief_summary>We propose study us challenge walk exercise research train program compare balance walk ability non-challenging exercise program , group 40 people long standing ( &gt; 6 month ) weakness occur stroke . Our main balance measure change Berg Balance Score Dynamic Gait Index , main walking measure walk speed 10 meter walkway distance walk six minute period . Also , measure balance confidence , use score Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale , change quality life measure Geriatric Depression Scale , SF-36 Stroke Impact Scale . If challenging exercise show effective non-challenging exercise , share promise new approach community hop improve people 's life stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Falls-based Training Walking Post-Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2009 , American Heart Association ( AHA ) report incidence hemiplegia patient six month post-stroke 65 year age 50 % . Stroke survivor chronic hemiplegia increase risk fall due poor motor control , muscle weakness , balance problem . While over-ground walk train show improve muscle coordination functional movement outcome stroke survivor , physical challenge balance training limited due safety concern . The limited training reflect individual ' natural environment , study show contain hazard put post-stroke individual great risk loss balance fall . Therefore , important clinician safely implement challenge environmental-hazard task way effect great improvement walk capability post-stroke . The usage body weight support ( BWS ) treadmill train show improve walk speed , without context real world hazard , individual may gain improvement balance relate task gain confidence move hazardous environment . The purpose study introduce novel , falls-based training ( FBT ) approach enable individual challenge high level balance walk safely , use new robotic device call KineAssistÂ® , determine relative effect compare traditional body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) . We hypothesize like standard BWSTT , novel FBT result improve walk speed , great 6 minute walk distance , great Berg Balance score . We also hypothesize FBT result great gain BWSTT training , great difference 6 month train . In addition walking test Berg Balance scale , compare outcome Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) , Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) SF-36 Health Survey , Activities-Specific Balance Confidence ( ABC ) Scale , K-9 task Balance test , Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) .</detailed_description>
