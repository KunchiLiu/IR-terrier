	<brief_summary>Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis ( BPS/IC ) difficult disease diagnose treat . It define unpleasant sensation ( pain , pressure , discomfort ) perceive related urinary bladder associate low urinary tract symptom least 6 week duration , absence infection identifiable cause . Pain universal symptom , many also experience symptom overactive bladder , possibly directly relate mechanism pain . Treating pain may influence symptom urgency , urge arises need alleviate pain . In patient whose pain improves treatment , trouble overactive bladder symptom still remain . Beta-3 adrenergic agonist find decrease signal C-fibers animal model . So , investigator hypothesize mirabegron , FDA-approved treatment overactive bladder , would also improve symptom patient BPS/IC . As selective beta-3 agonist , mirabegron act beta-3 receptor find bladder mediate relaxation detrusor muscle . It show significantly decrease number micturition episode , urgency episode , increase mean volume urine void per micturition . It also favorable tolerability profile .</brief_summary>
