	<brief_title>A Carbohydrate-restricted Diet Reverse Fatty Liver Adolescents With Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NAFLD common form liver disease child United States . Currently , treatment NAFLD . In adult , weight loss caloric restriction commonly recommend improve fatty liver . Weight loss particularly difficult child achieve significant caloric restriction may prudent recommendation develop child adolescent . Because difficulty weight loss child , many child go develop cirrhosis eventually undergo liver transplant . Data effectiveness diet reverse fatty liver prevent progression cirrhosis child urgently need . To date , study do examine change diet composition without intentional caloric restriction influence NAFLD child . Data previous study adult support hypothesis consumption lower-CHO , higher-fat food source rich high-quality protein essential fatty acid beneficial effect metabolic health adult without restrict calorie . This study aim test hypothesis low CHO higher- fat diet induce rapid reversal fatty liver also deplete total abdominal adiposity , preserve lean mass , reduce inflammation adolescent obesity NAFLD .</detailed_description>
