	<brief_summary>The study design open-label , randomize control trial . The study conduct study site Uganda South Africa . The study population include HIV-infected patient first-line antiretroviral therapy recent viral load &gt; 1,000 copies/milliliter ( dried blood spot viral load &gt; 1,000 copies/milliliter ) . Eligible participant randomize WHO-based standard care management virologic failure immediate resistance test guide ART regimen decision . The primary outcome interest viral suppression ( &lt; 200 copies/mL ) 9 month study enrollment , assess use intention treat analysis , miss absent result consider failure . Secondary outcomes interest viral suppression limit assay detection , viral suppression continuation first-line ( non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTI ] -based ) therapy , drug resistance study conclusion , mortality , among others . The overarch goal study determine whether addition routine resistance testing , guide management virologic failure sustain successful completion HIV continuum care , improve clinical outcome reduces cost patient virologic failure first-line therapy sub-Saharan Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY PROCEDURES FOR PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD OF CARE ARM A . Visit 1-SOC : Baseline Visit Standard Care Participants At Study Visit 1 , participant randomize SOC complete baseline questionnaire collect sociodemographic , HIV clinical treatment history , self-reported ART medication adherence , quality life , resource allocation data . Study staff review participant record collect data clinic initiation start date , opportunistic infection history , ART initiation date , ART regimen history , CD4 count viral load result history . A single 10cc blood specimen draw storage future test viral load , resistance testing , drug therapeutic monitoring . Upon completion baseline questionnaire , participant refer clinic counselor conduct adherence support counsel per standard clinical procedure . A follow-up study visit schedule 3 month baseline date ( 1 month pregnant participant ) . Any interim clinical visit indicate clinic staff maintain . The participant instruct continue current ART regimen least next clinical visit . B . Visit 2A-SOC : Repeat Viral Load Testing Visit At Study Visit 2A , participant SOC arm undergo blood collection viral load test keep WHO guideline . An additional tube 10cc tube draw storage future analyse . A study questionnaire administer assess self-reported ART medication adherence . No procedure schedule visit . Participants notify study staff contact soon result available , request return clinic management . The participant instruct continue current ART regimen least next clinical visit . As soon viral load result available , study participant contact requested return clinic review . If viral load indeterminate complete reason , study staff request participant return repeat viral load test . C. Visit 2B-SOC : Viral Load Testing Results Therapeutic Management At Study Visit 2B , study clinician review viral load result . Participants viral load ≤ 1,000 copies/mL continue first-line ( NNRTI-based ) ART regimen without change . Participants viral load &gt; 1,000 copies/mL change ART regimen second-line , protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based , available , integrase inhibitor ( II ) -based therapy . Clinicians also encourage change nucleos ( ) ide reverse transcriptase component regimen ( example , change zidovudine tenofovir ) , base prior exposure , well WHO national guideline . All regimen decision make study clinician , cooperation clinic staff study site . In case complex management issue , site principal investigator ( Dr. Bosco Bwana Mbarara Dr. Yunus Moosa Durban ) contact offer input . At conclusion Visit 2B-SOC , participant SOC arm schedule final study visit approximately 6 month later . A final visit 6 month choose allow ample time drug suppression participant detectable viral load 3-month visit . Non-study clinical visit routine clinical care continue interim determine schedule clinic staff . D. Visit 3 : Outcome Assessment At Study Visit 3 , participant undergo repeat blood test plasma viral load , viral load detectable , reflex resistance test perform . An additional 10cc tube draw storage future test . A study questionnaire administer assess resource allocation , ART medication adherence , quality life . Study staff review participant record update interim CD4 count , viral load , ART regimen data . Results viral load resistance test visit immediately make available clinic staff patient management . At conclusion Visit 3 , study procedure complete . E. Missing Late Appointments If study participant return study visit , study staff call encourage return clinic continuation completion procedure . For participant return within 7 day schedule visit unreachable phone , study staff member attempt track home use standardized lost-to-follow-up form procedure develop use successfully program clinical care Mbarara 10 year . If participant locate , study staff encourage return clinic complete procedure and/or conduct blood draw questionnaire field participant agree . STUDY PROCEDURES FOR PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO RESISTANCE TESTING ARM A . Visit 1-RT : Baseline Visit Resistance Testing Participants At Study Visit 1 , participant randomize RT complete baseline questionnaire collect sociodemographic , HIV clinical treatment history , self-reported ART medication adherence , quality life , resource allocation data . Study staff review participant record collect data clinic initiation start date , opportunistic infection history , ART initiation date , ART regimen history , CD4 count viral load result history . Upon completion baseline questionnaire , participant undergo phlebotomy resistance test . Participants notify study staff contact soon result available , request return clinic management . Upon completion study procedure , participant refer clinic counselor conduct adherence support counsel per standard clinical procedure . The participant instruct continue current ART regimen least next clinical visit . As soon resistance test result available , study participant contact phone request return clinic review . B . Visit 2-RT : Resistance Testing Results Therapeutic Management At Study Visit 2-RT , study clinician review resistance test result . A study HIV-1 RNA drug resistance interpretation guide use help guide decision-making . Participants without significant drug resistance , determine study clinician consultation resistance interpretation guide continue first-line ( NNRTI-based ) ART regimen without change . Participants therapeutic drug resistance change ART regimen second-line , protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based , available , integrase inhibitor ( II ) -based therapy . Clinicians also encourage change nucleos ( ) ide reverse transcriptase component regimen ( example , change zidovudine tenofovir ) . All regimen decision make study clinician , cooperation clinic staff study site . In case complex management issue , site principal investigator ( Dr. Bosco Bwana Mbarara Dr. Yunus Moosa Durban ) contact offer input . At conclusion Visit 2-RT , participant schedule final study visit approximately 9 month time enrollment . A final visit 9 month later choose match approximate 9-month study duration participant SOC arm . Non-study clinical visit routine clinical care continue interim determine schedule clinic staff . C. Visit 3 : Outcome Assessment At Study Visit 3 , participant undergo repeat blood test plasma viral load , viral load detectable , reflex resistance test perform . An additional 10cc tube draw storage future test viral load , resistance testing , drug therapeutic monitoring . A study questionnaire administer assess resource allocation quality life . Study staff review participant record update interim CD4 count , viral load , ART regimen data . Results viral load resistance test visit immediately make available clinic staff patient management . At conclusion Visit 3 , study procedure complete .</detailed_description>
