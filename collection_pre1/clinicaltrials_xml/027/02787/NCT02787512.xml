	<brief_title>Preoperative Biliary Drainage With Metal Versus Plastic Stents Periampullary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Jaundice one common symptom patient periampullary cancer include pancreatic cancer , common bile duct ( CBD ) cancer , ampulla Vater ( AoV ) cancer , duodenal cancer . Traditionally , preoperative biliary drainage ( PBD ) routinely perform cancer might favorably influence sepsis , endotoxemia , intravascular coagulation . However , recent randomize control study report routine PBD patient undergo surgery cancer pancreatic head increase rate complication . Therefore , routine PBD recommend . However , PBD still necessary case patient cholangitis high level bilirubin patient expect receive delay surgery . In patient necessity PBD , plastic stent ( PS ) use good temporary use cheap price . However , sometimes occluded surgery enough rapid decompress jaundice mainly short diameter . In aspect , self-expandable metal stent ( SEMS ) strength compare PS longer diameter enables rapid decompression few event occlusion . However , SEMS much expensive PS exact length stent critical . Although still lack evidence compare result PS SEMS , National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline recently recommend use short SEMS pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient cholangitis fever . However , need concrete evidence principle .</detailed_description>
