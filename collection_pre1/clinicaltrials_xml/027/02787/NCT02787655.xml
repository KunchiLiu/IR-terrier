	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study examine impact combine cognitive training aerobic exercise intervention sedentary old adult . Recent research demonstrate old adult participate aerobic fitness training significantly increase brain volume . Equally important , demonstrated enhancement brain size related improvement specific cognitive task . For example , researcher demonstrate 124 old adult randomly assign receive aerobic training experienced substantial improvement cognitive performance task related speed process work memory . Similarly , neuroimaging study show aerobically trained individual increase brain activation various cognitive task . A grow body research also demonstrate beneficial effect cognitive training later life promote healthy brain . For example , researcher demonstrate cognitive intervention target memory , reason speed processing effective improve brain function . Unfortunately , despite promising finding , generalizability cognitive training limited . For example , researcher show cognitive training task design improve reasoning , memory , planning , spatial skill attention 11,000 participant demonstrate transfer effect untrained task , even task closely relate . The purpose study see comb aerobic exercise cognitive training enhance cognitive improvement . Specially , investigator wish determine aerobic exercise do immediately cognitive training potentiate improvement . The investigator hypothesize aerobic exercise potentiate increase generalizability cognitive training . Importantly , study focus old adult at-risk mobility disability . This area particular importance consider large percentage adult enter old age therefore likely suffer age-related cognitive decline mobility disability . Background : Currently United States 23 million Veterans . Of number , 39.1 percent age 65 number greatly increase large percent US population age . Unfortunately , many individual suffer form age-related cognitive decline and/or mobility disability . Significantly , decline mental health mobility disability primary component expect 25 percent growth health care cost relate age crisis America . And , despite fact United States federal government spend $ 100 billion dollar annually cure and/or treat cognitive impairment , successful strategy improve impairment remain elusive . The propose research substantially advance development treatment cognitive mobility impairment goal explore intervention may potentially pervasive effect US Veterans quality life well-being physical well cognitive standpoint . Methods Research Plan : To address investigator ' research question 60 adult ( age 18-89 ) randomize one two 12 week intervention group : 1 ) Cognitive Training alone ( CT ) 2 ) Aerobic Exercise + Cognitive Training ( AE+CT ) . The aerobic exercise arm study follow format show improve broad range cognitive function older adult previous research . The cognitive training arm consist popular commercially-available brain fitness program demonstrate specific cognitive improvement high adherence . Baseline test consist battery cognitive function target verbal fluency , response inhibition , work memory . Additionally , participant undergo structural functional MRI . Participants also evaluate physical function assess 400 meter walk , balance test , questionnaire daily l functioning . And lastly , participant assess aerobic capacity visual outcomes serum BDNF . Following 12-week intervention participant post test manner baseline testing .</detailed_description>
