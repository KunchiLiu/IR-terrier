	<brief_summary>Total shoulder replacement associate considerable postoperative pain . A common method treat prevent post operative pain place catheter neck leave place 48 hour . The catheter delivers medication call ropivacaine directly major nerve near shoulder . It effective stop pain . In addition prevent pain , also prevent movement arm block nerve completely . A new method treat post operative pain use series small injection joint , skin , muscle shoulder near end surgery . This medication , liposomal bupivacaine ( Exparel ) , potentially provide analgesia great 48 hr require catheter remain place prevent patient move arm surgery block pain portion nerve . Both method also frequently include addition oral inject pain medicine like narcotic effectively control pain . Ropivacaine Exparel work well postoperative pain total shoulder replacement . It know , however , one method superior ability treat/prevent pain method may fewer side effect . The purpose study randomly assign patient receive either catheter ropivicaine Exparel injection help determine one method superior pain relief either method few side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liposomal Bupivacaine Infiltration v Continuous Perineural Ropivacaine Infusion Post-operative Pain After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty commonly receive interscalene block use ropivacaine provide analgesia . To provide analgesia 48 hour postoperatively , indwell catheter place constant infusion ropivacaine give . This safe effective technique manage postoperative pain population . This procedure associate reduce need narcotic improve patient satisfaction . Side effect uncommon include catheter displacement failure block . A consequence procedure cause paralysis weakness affect arm catheter remove drug wear . Liposomal bupivacaine ( Exparel , Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ) approve FDA October 2011 indicate administration surgical site produce postsurgical analgesia . The duration analgesia single administration 72 hour . Like ropivicaine constant infusion , Exparel associate good patient satisfaction reduce narcotic requirement . Its advantage continuous infusion technically far less challenging administer catheter insertion cause paralysis affect arm . We unaware study compare efficacy , patient satisfaction , complication rate two different procedure . It , therefore , purpose investigation explore difference . We aim randomly assign 100 subject open-labeled fashion schedule total shoulder arthroplasty UMROI receive either continuous infusion ropivicaine via interscalene catheter single administration single dose interscalene nerve block plus Exparel inject soft tissue within around shoulder surgery . In study , plan use open label randomize control trial compare efficacy one time dose liposomal bupivacaine vs. ropivacaine infusion 36 hour provide analgesia . All patient receive interscalene block ropivacaine operative anesthesia . The patient randomize either receive indwell interscalene catheter continuous infusion 6 ml per hour 0.2 % ropivacaine , surgical wound infiltration 266 mg 1.3 % liposomal bupivacaine suspension . The patient give rescue pain medication need subject suffer pain pain control local anesthetic . We plan compare amount rescue pain medication use individual group patient report pain score help determine whether local infiltration liposomal bupivacaine effective ropivacaine infusion provide analgesia . If surgical wound infiltration liposomal bupivacaine provide improved analgesia , would benefit future patient subject peripheral nerve catheter place would get equivalent pain relief single shot injection follow wound infiltration local anesthetic .</detailed_description>
