	<detailed_description>Influenza lead significant morbidity mortality , particularly patient cardiovascular disease . Influenza-related death common patient cardiovascular disease chronic health condition . Influenza infection temporally associate acute cardiovascular event , acute coronary syndrome acute heart failure . Due increase risk influenza-related complication , annual influenza immunization recommend Centers Disease Control Prevention , ( CDC ) American Heart Association , American College Cardiology , widespread influenza vaccination associate reduce cardiac-related hospital admission , acute exacerbation heart failure , winter mortality . Moreover , meta-analysis show annual vaccination reduces risk major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) 36 % , prominent effect recent acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . Several line evidence suggest strategy utilizing high-dose influenza vaccine risk cardiovascular patient would reduce morbidity mortality . Immune responses influenza vaccine , normally subject variability age concomitant medical condition , substantially reduce patient heart failure evidence low vaccine-induced antibody titer compare healthy control . In randomized trial , antibody response patient heart failure augment use high dose influenza vaccine . In meta-analysis , high dose influenza vaccination associate 27 % reduce risk MACE compare standard dose vaccine . A randomized study high dose versus standard dose influenza vaccine medically-stable patient age 65 show participant receive high dose vaccine 24 % reduce risk laboratory-confirmed influenza associate protocol-defined influenza-like-illness , low risk adverse event . High dose influenza vaccine FDA approve use medically stable adult age 65 , study patient age 65 unstable , high risk medical condition . The CDC preferentially recommend one influenza vaccine another , optimal vaccine formulation offer clinical protection high risk patient unknown . The high morbidity health care cost among patient high risk cardiovascular disease along reduce immune response standard dose influenza vaccine patient heart failure provide compelling rationale investigate alternative influenza vaccination strategy group . INVESTED outcome study patient recent acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) heart failure ( HF ) test whether four-fold high dose trivalent influenza vaccine reduce morbidity mortality compare standard dose quadrivalent vaccine . INVESTED test hypothesize high dose vaccine reduce composite cause death cardiopulmonary hospitalization population , follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 . To test hypothesis high dose trivalent influenza vaccine reduce composite death cardiopulmonary event compare standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine high-risk cardiovascular patient . Patients recent AMI HF hospitalization randomize high dose versus standard dose vaccine three influenza season . The primary endpoint time first occurrence death cardiopulmonary hospitalization within influenza season . Hospitalizations ascertain utilizing multiple approach ( phone , patient report , electronic health record ) . Key secondary outcome measure include total ( first recurrent ) cardiopulmonary hospitalization death , time first occurrence cardiovascular death cardiopulmonary hospitalization , time occurrence all-cause death cardiopulmonary hospitalization across enrol influenza season , time occurrence all-cause death , time first occurrence cardiopulmonary hospitalization . Specific Aim 2 . To test hypothesis antibody titer influenza vaccine antigen associate cardiopulmonary outcome . In subset participant , antibody titer hemagglutination inhibition assay influenza vaccine antigen baseline 4 week follow randomization determine , correspond achievement maximal antibody titer level vaccination . The association geometric mean titer post-vaccination occurrence death cardiopulmonary hospitalization ( primary outcome measure Specific Aim 1 ) assess . Other key correlative study ( immune ) outcome measure include : Change antibody titer 4 week post-vaccination baseline influenza vaccine antigens Seroconversion ( demonstration 4-fold rise antibody concentration baseline ) seroprotection ( demonstration antibody titer level 1:40 ) A/H1N1 , A/H3N2 , B-type vaccine antigens The result trial potential inform health care policy regard optimal influenza vaccination individual high risk cardiovascular disease , may turn reduce morbidity annual threat health stability patient cardiovascular condition .</detailed_description>
