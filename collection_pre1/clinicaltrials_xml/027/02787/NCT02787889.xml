	<detailed_description>The demonstrated benefit increase protein intake sarcopenia many physiological function become increasingly evident . For reason , grow importance ensure Americans consume recommend amount protein , calculate 17-21 % caloric intake . As relates prevention sarcopenia , adequate protein consumption inherently assume sufficient protein ingest stimulate protein anabolism . Specifically , adequate essential amino acid precursor , anabolic trigger leucine , must present protein anabolism occur . Population data NHANES study suggest American protein intake pattern skew towards even meal . The NHANES data also suggest average protein consumption men woman age 50 yr approximately 1.1 g/kg/d . Thus , prevalent consumption pattern ensure many individual consume adequate protein , amino acid precursor sufficient stimulate protein synthesis , large , dinner meal . The investigator demonstrate frequent stimulation protein synthesis amino acid preserve strength function . Others demonstrate adequate protein intake stimulates muscle protein synthesis increase lean mass . Given data , The investigator study effect two different protein intake pattern metabolic functional outcome older individual 8 wks dietary control . The mean protein intake group 1.1 g/kg/d consume two distinct meal pattern . Participants consume high quality protein ratio 15/20/65 % total protein intake breakfast/lunch/dinner , respectively ( Uneven protein intake pattern ) , protein consumption distribute equally among meal ( 33 % total protein ) ( Even protein intake pattern ) . The investigator determine longitudinal effect consumption pattern metabolic outcomes whole-body net protein synthesis muscle protein synthesis old participant .</detailed_description>
