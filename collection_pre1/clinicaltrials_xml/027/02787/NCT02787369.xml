	<brief_title>ACY-1215 Combination With BCR Pathway Inhibitors Relapsed CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial . The investigator study combination B-cell receptor ( BCR ) pathway inhibitor ricolinostat , order try enhance initial remission help improve response relapse first inhibitor receive second . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve ACY-1215 treatment disease . ACY-1215 ricolinostat histone deacetylase inhibitor , specifically HDAC6 . The FDA approve idelalisib well ibrutinib treatment option Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocyic Leukemia ( CLL ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must confirm CLL/SLL relapse least one prior therapy currently need treatment IWCLL 2008 criterion Age ≥ 18 ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) For ibrutinib arm : participant must currently require ongoing anticoagulation reason , major bleed event within 6 month enrollment Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1000 K/μL platelet count &gt; 30,000 K/μL independent transfusion support . total bilirubin &lt; 2X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless predominantly indirect therefore likely due hemolysis Gilbert 's syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤3X institutional upper limit normal ibrutinib arm ; within normal limit idelalisib arm creatinine &lt; 2X ULN Participants must measurable disease , include least one following : absolute B cell count &gt; 5000/uL , OR lymphadenopathy least one lymph node &gt; 2 cm long axis , OR palpable splenomegaly , OR cytopenia ( Hb &lt; 11 g/dL platelet &lt; 100K ) together bone marrow infiltration The effect drug study research protocol develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion treatment administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Participants receive investigational agent . Prior therapy HDAC inhibitor . Participants history poor tolerance either ibrutinib idelalisib enrol arm containing drug , may enrol arm . Must agree share study medication another person . Participants require medication substance strong inducer inhibitor CYP3A4 ineligible . Those may discontinue medication eligible 7 day washout period . . Mild moderate inducer inhibitor CYP3A4 permit moderate inhibitor require dose reduction ibrutinib ( see section 5.5 ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study ACY1215 , well ibrutinib idelalisib , unknown effect develop fetus newborn . Breastfeeding discontinue mother treat research protocol . HIVpositive participant CYP3A4 modulate antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction ACY1215 , ibrutinib idelalisib . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Participants require active chemotherapy another cancer . Those require hormonal therapy radiation therapy may consider enrollment case case basis . Corrected QT interval use Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) value &gt; 480 msec screening ; family personal history long QTc syndrome ventricular arrhythmia include ventricular bigeminy screening ; previous history druginduced QTc prolongation need treatment medication know suspected produce prolonged QTc interval ECG . Positive hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) surface antigen , core antibody ; know suspect active hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , idelalisib arm . On ibrutinib arm , patient positive hepatitis B surface antigen may appropriately treat enrol study long HBV DNA / viral load undetectable . Patients positive hepB core antibody negative surface antigen eligible ibrutinib arm , patient hepatitis C. Subjects require anticoagulation warfarin vitamin K antagonists exclude ibrutinib arm . If previously drug switch , INR must normal 7 day prior enrollment . Subjects enrol ibrutinib arm must major surgery within 14 day , minor surgery within 7 day . Participant must able swallow pill .</criteria>
