	<brief_title>Dosage Serum Tryptase Levels Population Premature Newborns Evaluate Mast Cell Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It seem appropriate believe prematurity associate genetic-related sensitivity , involve several signal pathway , make child vulnerable different environmental , infectious factor could trigger different pathology premature baby . Mast cell , via mediator , seem play key role . Dosage serum tryptase level easily accessible work Vitte let u imagine young child , great mast cell expression , thus open capital pathway comprehension immune system phenomena premature baby investigator hope perform regular workups serum tryptase level , investigator could validate premature baby express activity important manner . The relationship eventual pathological phenomenon necrotizing enterocolitis , also bronchopulmonary dysplasia could highlight .</detailed_description>
