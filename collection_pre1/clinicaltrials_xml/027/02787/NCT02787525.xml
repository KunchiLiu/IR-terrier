	<brief_summary>The aim study compare intermedium-term clinical outcome , include thromboembolic event bleed complication patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation treat either oral anticoagulation undergone LAA-closure ( leave atrial closure ) . A questionnaire sent patient information miss unclear , investigator contact patient treat physician get missing/unclear information . The study population consist 500 patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( AF ) underwent LAAC year 2009 2014 two center ( Bern University hospital und Zurich University hospital ) similar group 500 patient non-valvular AF treat oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) . In order compare two group reduce bias due confound variable , propensity score matching perform . Study hypothesis leave atrial appendage closure non-inferior term efficacy safety comparison lifelong oral anticoagulation patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Outcomes After Left Atrial Appendage Closure Oral Anticoagulation Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-valvular atrial fibrillation common arrhythmia estimate prevalence 1-2 % general population , increase age . Patients AF increase risk thromboembolism , particular ischemic stroke . LAAC seem actual knowledge valid alternative OAC . The objective study compare intermedium-term clinical outcome , include thromboembolic event bleed complication patient receive Amplatzer device vs. propensity score match patient treated OAC . A questionnaire sent patient ask thrombo-embolic event , stroke , death , bleed also current medication , comorbidities ( i.e . arterial hypertension , diabetes mellitus , renal impairment liver disease ) , hospitalization quality life . If information miss unclear , investigator contact patient treat physician get miss information . The study investigator-initiated , retrospective analysis prospectively collect data . The study population consist 500 patient non-valvular AF underwent LAAC year 2009 2014 two center ( Bern University hospital und Zurich University hospital ) propensity score match patient group 500 patient non-valvular AF treat OAC . Covariates matching age , gender , renal function , coronary artery disease status revascularization , left-ventricular function , HAS-BLED CHA2DS2-VASc-Score . Study hypothesis leave atrial appendage closure non-inferior term efficacy safety comparison lifelong oral anticoagulation patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>
