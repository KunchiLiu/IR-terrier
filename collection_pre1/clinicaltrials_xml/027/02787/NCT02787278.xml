	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Two Doses SP-8203 Patients With Ischemic Stroke Requiring rtPA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As standard procedure rtPA therapy , rtPA inject intravenously use device like infusion pump . When reperfusion achieve spite rtPA therapy , endovascular therapy perform accord judgment site investigator . Stage 1-The trial conduct 11 subject participate open label design manner . Subjects neurologic deficit ≥4 point ≤10 point NIHSS score give SP-8203 , 80mg/dose , total 6 time interval 12 hour . For first administration SP-8203 , administer within 30 minute initiation rtPA administration via vein route different one via rtPA inject . Thereafter , subject transfer MRI scan room brain MRI MRA perform , brain CT perform check occurrence intracranial hemorrhage 24 hour complete administration first dose SP-8203 . The subject closely monitor research staff daily day first administration SP-8203 ( Day 0 ) Day 5 . Brain MRI MRA follow last administration SP-8203 Day 5 . The subject make visit Day 14 his/her neurologic symptom check , subject 's participation trial complete . *The DSMB ( Date Safety Monitoring Board ) meeting hold , decide whether proceed Stage 2 , base result Stage 1 . Stage 2- A total 69 subject enrol double-blind , randomize parallel design 23 subject assign low-dose ( 40mg/dose , 80mg/ day ) SP-8203 group , high-dose ( 80mg/dose , 160mg/day ) SP-8203 group placebo group , respectively . If subject , able enrol Stage 2 , neurological deficit ≥4 point NIHSS score give patient 's consent participate trial , randomization perform treatment arm ( one three ) assign . The subject receive Investigational product total 6 time , 12 hour interval . Blood sample take sixth administration Investigational product pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamics analysis . For pharmacokinetic analysis , blood sample take 0 , 30 , 120 minute complete sixth administration investigational product . For pharmacodynamics analysis , blood sample take 24 48 hour first administration , 0 minute sixth administration 4th week visit . As Stage 1 , subject brain MRI MRA perform administration investigational product , brain CT perform 24 hour completion first administration investigational product . Brain MRI MRA followed-up Day 5 , similarly Stage 1 . However , Stage 2 , subject make visit close monitoring patient 's neurological condition 4th week 12th week . Thereafter , procedures clinical trial complete .</detailed_description>
