	<brief_summary>Patients significant ascites advance ovarian cancer ( AOC ) , undergo complex , cytoreductive surgery risk malnutrition , poor quality life risk hypo- hypervolemia perioperative period . All factor may cause hemodynamic consequence anesthesia surgery , elevate risk morbidity mortality . The objective study evaluate , whether slow ascites evacuation day surgery AOC , could 1 ) influence hemodynamic consequence ascites systemic circulation patient undergoing surgery , 2 ) improve patient 's quality life 3 ) ability fee correctly treatment start , thus low risk perioperative morbidity . Eligible patient significant ascites , diagnose suspect AOC , schedule primary surgery ( upfront cytoreduction laparoscopic evaluation neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) , perform within next 7 day , reason . Patients ask fill quality life questionnaire ( QLQ ) . Clinical data , Subjective Global Assessment ( SGA ) record . Patients randomize either intervention arm A - insertion vascular catheter abdominal cavity slow , systematic , daily ascites evacuation , observation arm B - standard care observation ( acute large volume ( &gt; 5000ml ) paracentesis allow need ) . Patients group encourage use oral nutritional support . Randomization open , 1:1 , every eligible , consecutive patient . After 7 day patient interview , ask fill QLQ , patient 's experience treatment survey , SGA record . During first hour surgery hemodynamic data anethetic chart record along clinical data concern patient 's characteristic , surgery detail 30-day postoperative follow-up . A template provide . The hypothesis study slow , systematic ascites evacuation day surgery advanced ovarian cancer facilitate hemodynamic control systemic circulation patient undergoing surgery , improve patient ' quality life , feed ability treatment start . Secondary would expect low risk perioperative morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
