	<brief_summary>Heart surgery procedure still widely use worldwide treatment patient heart problem , rate complication postoperative period relate remain high . In patient , physical conditioning program result improve functional capacity , reduce heart rate systolic blood pressure . The inspiratory muscle training also emerge valuable strategy treatment cardiac patient . The study interaction cardiac rehabilitation high intensity IMT change yet understood population . The aim study assess effect inspiratory muscle training high intensity associate cardiac rehabilitation exercise performance patient postoperative period CABG surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It control , randomize clinical trial patient randomly assign randomly referral cardiac rehabilitation : Group 1 IMT-HI , group 2 - IMT-HI control . The evaluator outcomes blind group . The study protocol last 36 session group . The group 1 patient performs cardiac rehabilitation protocol 40 minute cardio stretch also inspiratory muscle training protocol high intensity 50 % load increase maximal inspiratory pressure first two week , 60 % MIP third fourth week , 70 % MIP fifth sixth week 80 % MIP seventh eighth week . The group 2 patient perform cardiac rehabilitation protocol 40 minute aerobic exercise stretching .</detailed_description>
