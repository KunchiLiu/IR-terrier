	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Investigate Efficacy Safety IMP Patients With Non Healing Wounds Originating From Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This interventional , single arm , phase I/IIa clinical trial investigate efficacy safety ABCB5+ mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) wind heal patient chronic venous ulcer ( CVU ) . Autologous MSCs isolate ex vivo small skin biopsy expand vitro . The IMP APZ2 incorporate ABCB5+ apply wound surface CVU local anesthesia . Patients follow efficacy 3 month allow distinguish actual wound heal transient wound coverage . The wound heal process document standardized photography . The wound size evaluation start day first change wound dressing . The quality wound heal process assess basis formation granulation tissue , epithelialization wound exudation . Pain assess use numerical rating scale quality life investigate standardized validated questionnaire . To assess long-term safety APZ2 additional follow-up visit Month 12 post IMP application include .</detailed_description>
