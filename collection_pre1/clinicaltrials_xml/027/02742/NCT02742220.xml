	<brief_summary>The aim study analyze effect isometric handgrip training ( IHT ) blood pressure hypertensive patient peripheral arterial disease . Will recruit 60 patient randomize 2 group ( 30 per group ) , IHT control group ( CG ) . IHT group train isometric contraction 8 week . The GC patient encourage increase level physical activity . In pre post-intervention , brachial central blood pressure measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meta-analyze study show IHT promotes reduction blood pressure ( BP ) , reach 10 mmHg systolic diastolic 7 mmHg . However , remain uncertain effect type training BP patient severe cardiovascular disease peripheral artery disease . Because type training require approximately 20 minute per session require supervision , possible intervention interest reduce BP patient . The aim study analyze effect IHT blood pressure hypertensive patient peripheral arterial disease . Will recruit 60 patient , randomize 2 group ( 30 per group ) , IHT control group ( CG ) . IHT group hold three session per week four unilateral set two minute isometric contraction 30 % maximal voluntary contraction interval four minute , 8 week . The GC patient encourage increase level physical activity . In pre post-intervention , go evaluate functional capacity , brachial central BP , arterial stiffness , cardiovascular autonomic modulation muscle vasodilation . Will use analyze two-factor variance repeat measure , group ( IHT GC ) time ( 8 week ) factor post-hoc test Newman-Keuls .</detailed_description>
