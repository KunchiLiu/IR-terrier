	<detailed_description>Screen potential HFpEF patient eligibility criteria interest Study Visit 1 • Initiate consent process obtain write informed consent . - Confirm participant HF symptom primary limitation activity . If , proceed CPET screening . If , consider screen fail . - Obtain baseline blood *- CBC , complete chemistry panel , biomarkers , biorepository genetics ( agree participate ) . - Obtain CPET verify patient eligibility peak VO2 ≤ 75 % predict RER ≥ 1.0 ( within 3 day prior randomization ) establish baseline value . - Qualifying patient perform additional baseline study : history , assess NYHA class , physical exam , ECG , KCCQ . - Open label , single-dose run-in patient receive maximal dose ( 80 mg ) inhale inorganic nitrite . Patients tolerate run-in consider screen failure . - Randomize qualifying patient . - Dispense phase-1 study drug , nebulizer accelerometer - Participants take study drug two week ( baseline ) . - Participants take 46 mg study drug minimum 4 hour apart , 3 time day , active part day 7 day . - Participants take 80 mg study drug minimum 4 hour apart , 3 time day , active part day return study visit 2 ( least 42 day 49 day post-baseline visit ) . - If side effect develop , participant down-titrate previous dose . - Participants call frequently reinforce study procedure assess compliance . Study Visit 2 ( 42-49 Days Post Study Visit 1 ) - Participant hold study drug day visit . - Review history , assess NYHA class , perform physical exam KCCQ . - Obtain blood draw ** - CBC , complete chemistry panel , biomarkers , biorepository ( agreed participate ) . - Obtain limited echocardiogram ** . - Perform CPET Study Drug administer immediately start CPET ( primary endpoint ) . - Change accelerometer dispense phase-2 study drug . - Participants take study drug two week ( washout ) . - Participants take 46 mg study drug minimum 4 hour apart , 3 time day , active part day 7 day . - Participants take 80 mg study drug minimum 4 hour apart , 3 time day , active part day return study visit 3 ( least 42 49 day study visit 2 ) . - If side effect develop Participants down-titrate previously tolerate dose . - Participants call frequently reinforce study procedure assess compliance . Study Visit 3 ( 42-49 Days Post Study Visit 2 ) • Participant hold study drug day visit . - Review history , assess NYHA class , perform physical exam KCCQ - Obtain blood draws** - CBC , complete chemistry panel , biomarkers , biorepository ( agreed participate ) . - Obtain limited echocardiogram** . - Perform CPET Study Drug administer immediately start CPET ( primary endpoint ) . - Return accelerometer phase-2 study drug . - End study drug ( phase ) . Phone Visit End Study ( 14 Days Post Study Visit 3 ) - A final phone visit conduct assess adverse event . - Visit 1 : baseline blood draw need complete prior CPET ( feasible , obtain least 3 hour post CPET prior run-in test dose ) . - Visit 2 Visit 3 : blood draw limit echo need obtain prior study drug administration ( feasible , obtain least 3 hour post study drug administration )</detailed_description>
