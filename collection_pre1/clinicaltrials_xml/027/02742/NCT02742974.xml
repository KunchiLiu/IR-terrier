	<detailed_description>Numerous factor know contribute post-traumatic morbidity mortality . Acute blood loss , hypovolemia , systemic inflammatory response syndrome often develop follow severe traumatic injury , frequently , exacerbate presence pre-existing health condition . The culmination insult and/or pre-existing condition precipitate imbalance oxygen delivery consumption lead tissue ischemia resultant organ dysfunction . Tissue ischemia precipitate disruption balance oxygen delivery consumption often yield conversion aerobic anaerobic process order maintain metabolic functionality . The conversion anaerobic process lead production lactic acid result consumption body 's basic buffer . Clinically , consumption body 's basic buffer frequently refer development base deficit . Both production lactic acid development base deficit positively link increased morbidity mortality multiple critically ill patient population , include traumatic injury . Multiple study link rate base deficit correct lactic acid clear likelihood survival . Accordingly , hemodynamic monitoring provide vital information concern cardiovascular function include vascular volume , vascular capacitance , cardiac performance . Obtaining information enables clinicians tailor intervention target specific component cardiovascular system order effectively reverse cause tissue hypoxia , elevation lactic acid , base deficit , simultaneously decrease likelihood cause harm unnecessary unwarranted change management . Advancements hemodynamic monitoring technology allow clinician obtain data use minimally invasive technique . Devices utilize technology connect vascular access routinely utilized intensive care set arterial line . These device provide parameter systolic pressure variation ( SPV ) , pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) predict fluid responsiveness critically ill , mechanically ventilated patient . Studies evaluate parameter show 84-94 % positive predictive value fluid responsiveness . In addition , high variability study parameter indicative patient likely responsive fluid challenge . Modern clinical management critically ill patient cardiovascular dysfunction hinge reversal underlie cause cardiovascular dysfunction . Recent management strategy use multi-faceted approach multiple process potential dysfunction monitor manage simultaneously . Management goal direct clearly define endpoint management vascular volume , cardiac performance well maintenance vascular capacitance . Hemodynamic monitoring technology essential provide data allow clinical intervention tailor patient-specific physiology provide goal titration therapy . In recent year , data emerge use goal direct therapy surgical patient population favorable outcome suggest decrease post-operative organ dysfunction , ICU hospital length stay , however , limited data trauma patient population . This study endeavor determine implementation intra-operative monitoring decrease incidence post-operative complication acute lung injury , infection , thromboembolism , cerebral vascular accident , acute kidney injury , myocardial infarction ; addition traditional outcome measure mortality length stay .</detailed_description>
