	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Tolerability Using SHR-1210 Advanced Solid Tumor Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single center , nonrandomized , dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluate safety tolerability SHR-1210 subject advance Solid Tumors fail current standard antitumor therapy . The safety tolerability SHR-1210 assess ongoing review clinical laboratory test , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , adverse event . Evaluations immune safety also conduct ( immune-related AEs , labs autoimmune serum , inflammatory event , immunogenicity ) . Safety evaluation ( clinical laboratory ) perform baseline , study treatment , throughout study . Efficacy assess every 8 week . The study consist 3 period : screening ( 14 day first dose ) , treatment , follow-up ( 3 month last dose study treatment ) .</detailed_description>
