	<brief_summary>This open-label SPECT/CT ( single photon emission compute tomography / compute tomography ) study investigate clinical study 99mTc-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT diagnosis efficacy evaluation breast cancer . Diagnostic group : patient suspicion breast cancer . The standard truth diagnosis base histopathologic finding surgical removal tumor definite diagnosis fine needle aspiration biopsy . A single dose nearly 0.3 mCi/kg ( milli-Curie/kilogram ) body weight 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg 3PRGD2 ) intravenously injected patient . Visual semiquantitative method use ass whole-body planar lesion SPECT/CT image . Efficacy evaluation group : patient firstly diagnose malignant tumor ( breast cancer ) , prepare chemotherapy ( include neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) radiotherapy . The standard truth diagnosis base histopathologic finding fine needle aspiration biopsy . A single dose nearly 0.3 mCi/kg body weight 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg 3PRGD2 ) intravenously injected patient treatment , second period , sixth period . Visual , semiquantitative method use ass whole-body planar lesion SPECT/CT image . By compare result related imaging , instance , PET/CT ( positron emission tomography/computed tomography ) , CT ( compute tomography ) , MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , Doppler Ultrasound , Mammography , etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Integrin αvβ3 important member integrin receptor family express preferentially activate endothelial cell angiogenesis type tumor cell , low quiescent vessel cell normal cell . Therefore , integrin αvβ3 receptor become valuable target diagnosis response evaluation malignant tumor . The tri-peptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) specifically bind integrin αvβ3 receptor . Accordingly , variety radiolabeled RGD-based peptide develop non-invasive imaging integrin αvβ3 expression via single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Among RGD radiotracers study , several RGD monomer investigate clinical trial , preliminary result demonstrate specific image various type tumor , tumor uptake correlate well level integrin αvβ3 expression . Recently , several RGD dimeric peptide PEG linkers study . The new type RGD peptides show much high vitro integrin αvβ3-binding affinity single RGD tri-peptide sequence , importantly , exhibit significantly increase tumor uptake improve vivo kinetics animal model . As representative , 99mTc-3PRGD2 could easily prepare exhibited excellent vivo behavior animal model . No adverse reaction observe animal model date . For interest clinical trial 99mTc-3PRGD2 , open-label SPECT/CT ( single photon emission compute tomography / compute tomography ) study investigate 99mTc-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT diagnosis efficacy evaluation breast cancer . A single dose nearly 0.3 mCi/kg body weight 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg 3PRGD2 ) intravenously injected patient . Visual semiquantitative method use ass whole-body planar lesion SPECT/CT image . Adverse event also observe patient .</detailed_description>
