	<brief_title>Clinical Decision Rule Pediatric Intracranial Pathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Question : A significant number child present Emergency Department ( ED ) headache migraine undergo head image Computed Tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . However , relatively low yield image neurologically normal patient base prior study . The goal study describe utilization head CT MRI among pediatric ED patient headache migraine . The investigator plan evaluate clinical examination characteristic patient , use information develop clinical decision rule help provider predict risk find abnormality affect patient treatment . Design : The investigator perform study child 6 18 year age present ED headache migraine . At time visit provider ask complete questionnaire regard exam history without make change patient care . The investigator also contact sub-group patient undergo MRI CT , 12-14 week discharge ask subsequent headache care leave facility . Methods : All child age 6-18 year present ED chief complaint headache migraine eligible study . Patients exclude meet follow criterion : trauma within 48 hour , previous neurosurgery ( shunt include ) , know tumor , history cerebral hemorrhage/ischemia , Sickle Cell Disease , thrombophilia , bleed disorder non-English speaker . ED Research Assistants ED staff physician nurse practitioner screen potential candidate ask provider review inclusion criterion . If eligibility criterion meet , provider complete standardize data collection form regard exam history finding . Patient care impact alter . Research Assistants also provide Parent Information Sheet ( either visit , mail follow ED visit ) family patient enrol informing may contact follow discharge . Medical record review eligible patient obtain information patient demographic , course treatment diagnosis . For patient head CT MRI perform visit , family contact 12-14 week later determine subsequent care headache . If family unable reach phone , patient chart review pertinent visit . Analysis : For patient characteristic examine , investigator look statistically significant difference patient normal head imaging , abnormal imaging . Using characteristic significantly different , investigator develop clinical decision rule help provider assess risk significant finding individual patient . The investigator also develop decision tree help aid provider decide patient need head imaging . A sample patient two independent assessment allow u look evidence inter‚Äêrater reliability questionnaire .</detailed_description>
