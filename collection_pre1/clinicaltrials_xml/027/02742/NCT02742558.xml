	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Locally Manufactured Oral Cholera Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cholera continue major cause morbidity mortality low-income country include Bangladesh . It estimate least 300,000 severe case 4,500 death Bangladesh year1 . The overall morbidity cholera remain high . A global stockpile OCV create WHO 2013 epidemic outbreak settings2 . However , global demand vaccine far exceed present supply epidemic also endemic settings3 . It envision local production affordable OCV high risk population endemic setting improve present scenario Bangladesh country . Knowledge gap : The WHO recommend OCV use endemic epidemic cholera settings4 . At present two vaccine WHO prequalified . These include Dukoral register Bangladesh 50 country . However , disadvantage use Dukoral current price expensive Bangladesh develop country . In addition , need buffer formulate vaccine make less fieldable mass vaccination program . Another whole cell kill OCV , ShancholTM , WHO prequalified , base similar bacterial component Dukoral license India Bangladesh . Although vaccine relatively affordable may sufficiently cost effective Government Bangladesh implement poor endemic setting . At present , vaccine short supply able meet global demand . In order increase supply OCV make vaccine affordable , locally manufacture kill bivalent whole cell-oral cholera vaccine Cholvax available . The present study evaluate safety immunogenicity Cholvax test vaccine use Shanchol TM comparator vaccine non inferiority trial design . Relevance : The study locally manufacture OCV , Cholvax among child adult able give u information regard safety immunogenicity vaccine . Based information , anticipate regulatory requirement well licensure vaccine initiate Bangladesh . This pave way forward future approval WHO global use . The introduction Cholvax endemic setting , seasonal outbreak well EPI program country future expect base study result ; initiative plan make introduce locally produce vaccine Bangladesh affordable cost future globally . Hypothesis ( ) : Locally produce orally administer whole cell inactivate bivalent cholera vaccine , Cholvax non inferior least safe immunogenic adult child Bangladesh compare Shanchol TM . Objectives : The objective study are- . To evaluate compare safety immunogenicity Cholvax ShancholTM ii . To evaluate safety immunogenicity Cholvax healthy adult child Dhaka . iii . To evaluate compare safety immunogenicity 3 Cholvax lot ( lot-to-lot consistency ) Methods : This randomize , observer blind comparative study total 2052 healthy participant , 1026 Cholvax ( Test Group ) 1026 ShancholTM ( Comparator Group ) recipients . There three age cohort arm test comparator group consist 219 participant age 1-5Yrs , 373 participant age 6-17Yrs 434 Age 18-45Yrs , total 2052 participant . Participants receive either Cholvax ShancholTM two dose 14 day apart . Each age cohort study ( Cohort I onwards ) complete base development , progress , next age cohort initiate . If vaccine find safe adult test child , 6-17 year age follow young age group 1-5 year age . The result present Data Safety Monitoring Board complete 28-day safety surveillance part age cohort study proceed next study age cohort .</detailed_description>
