	<detailed_description>This study design analyze response diffuse , intrinsic brainstem glioma ( DIPG ) Antineoplaston therapy 5 separate patient cohort , define age prior therapy . The primary endpoint objective response ( OR ) , determination OR DIPG problematic . Determination OR use Macdonald , RANO , RECIST criterion relies postgadolinium TI-weighted MRI image enhance disease . However , DIPG show variable enhancement non-enhancing component see T2/FLAIR-weighted MRI image . Recent review propose OR assessment diffuse low grade glioma use modify RANO criterion recurrent glioblastoma use RECIST + F ( T2/FLAIR-weighted image ) .Neither methodology validate . This single-arm Phase 2 study efficacy Antineoplaston therapy DIPG utilize bidimensional assessment enhance DIPG ( RANO ) , validate primary endpoint , unidimensional assessment enhance + non-enhancing DIPG ( RECIST + F ) , exploratory endpoint . This Phase 2 protocol strategy early assessment response rate procedure termination enrollment lack efficacy . A minimax two-stage design utilized . Ten patient enhance disease enrol stage 1 cohort . If none 10 patient particular cohort achieves OR base bidimensional measurement , additional patient enhance disease enrol particular cohort . However , 1 10 patient enhance disease particular cohort achieves OR , additional 10 patient enhance disease enrol stage 2 minimax design cohort , yield maximum 20 patient enhance disease cohort . As exploratory endpoint , complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , progressive disease ( PD ) rate , well 6- , 12- , 24-month overall survival ( OS ) analyze . Patients enhance disease also enrol cohort count number designate two-stage minimax design . An exploratory endpoint patient 6- , 12- , 24-month OS . Other exploratory endpoint determination OR , CR , PR , PD base unidimensional measurement enhance + non-enhancing component DIPG ( RECIST + F ) . At completion study , efficacy Antineoplaston therapy cohort desirability development particular cohort determine discussion FDA .</detailed_description>
