	<brief_summary>This study randomize clinical trial last 24 month two study site , Hong Kong ( water fluoridate ) Guangzhou ( non-fluoridated area ) . A total 534 subject recruit elderly social center locate different district two study site ( 260 &amp; 274 ) . Baseline clinical examination conduct single calibrate examiner social center use intra-oral LED light , mouth mirror probe . Subjects randomly allocate two study group receive intervention accordingly . Follow-up examination 6-month interval carry assess clinical outcome , i.e . whether new root caries develop whether active root caries find baseline become arrest . Results study could provide much need evidence guide dental professional Hong Kong China , possibly worldwide decide appropriate intervention prevention management common dental disease old adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary secondary outcome study new root caries arrest root caries . A root surface new caries experience record root surface sound baseline find carious lesion fill follow-up examination . Arrested root caries record active root caries find baseline change inactive root caries follow-up . The status root surface record use code recommend International Caries Detection Assessment System ( ICDAS â…¡ ) Coordinating Committee 2009 . A mean root caries increment around 0.8 root surface per year control group report previous clinical trial conduct Hong Kong . Thus , study , 24-month increment 1.6 new decay root surface standard deviation 2 anticipate . In order show 50 % difference mean caries increment test control group statistically significant use 2-sample t-test 5 % significance level 80 % power , sample size 100 subject group require . Allowing drop-out rate 20 % 24 month , total 480 subject ( 120 group site ) need .</detailed_description>
