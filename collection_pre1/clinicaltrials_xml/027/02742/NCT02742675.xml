	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research learn treatment androgen deprivation therapy combination surgery radiation therapy prolong progression-free survival oligometastatic prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy alone . The safety treatment combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Deprivation Therapy Androgen Deprivation Therapy Plus Definitive Treatment ( Radiation Surgery )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today androgen deprivation therapy standard treatment metastatic prostate cancer , special type prostate cancerâ€”oligometastatic prostate cancer , except androgen deprivation therapy , whether local treatment part treatment ? The purpose study evaluate whether local treatment combine androgen deprivation therapy extend progression-free survival , well overall survival life quality patient oligometastatic prostate cancer compare androgen deprivation therapy alone .</detailed_description>
