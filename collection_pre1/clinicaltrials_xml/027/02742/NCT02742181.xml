	<detailed_description>At time diagnosis postoperative ileus enrollment randomization , patient return NPO status . Nasogastric tube ( NGT ) may place gastric decompression discretion surgical team clinically indicate . In event NGT place , medication give orally via NGT , clamp 30 minute administration . Patients continue standard ERAS pathways exception reduction diet . Antiemetics give clinically indicate ; however , prokinetic promotility agent give schedule dosage . Patients randomize study group give 12mg Entereg orally twice day , time diagnosis postoperative ileus time return bowel function 5 day . Patients randomize control group receive standard postoperative care . The patient surgical team able know arm study patient base documentation medical record administration Entereg . Patients group remain NPO return bowel function , define passage stool , decrease nasogastric tube output . At point , nasogastric tube remove trial oral diet attempt per surgeon 's discretion . Standard discharge criterion apply patient , include : - Passage stool - Ability tolerate solid food drink comfortably - Adequate oral analgesia - Patient 's willingness discharge . Data collect The medical/surgical information collect part research study information already available part patient medical chart . - Patient name , medical record number - Past Medical History - Past Surgical history - Preoperative Medications ( include steroid , anticoagulation , opioid use ) - Pre-operative Diagnosis - Patient Demographics ( age , gender , BMI , ASA score ) - Procedure perform - Time surgery - Wound classification - Estimated blood loss - Intraoperative transfusion - Intraoperative IV fluid give - Conversion laparoscopic open procedure - Stoma creation - Time/day surgery ileus - Time surgery medication give - Time ileus diagnosis medication give - Was return bowel function ( flatus stool , solid liquid , stoma output ) prior ileus - Intra-abdominal infection/anastomotic leak - Time/day return bowel function post ileus ( flatus stool- solid liquid , stoma function ) - Time/day ability tolerate oral diet ( liquid solid food ) - Nasogastric tube placement daily output - Duration nasogastric tube - Use type anti-emetics give - Total number Entereg dose give - Post operative complication include reoperation - Length stay hospital , define time surgery discharge - 30-day readmission Study Completion Completion participation study 30 day date surgery . Any readmission 30 day post-operatively hospital direct result surgery follow . The patient follow-up surgeon office approximately 3-6 week , consider standard care patient undergo colorectal surgery consider part research study . Any patient follow-up documentation miss incomplete shall contact via telephone . The purpose call simply determine return function outcome . Only co-investigator shall contact subject identify begin call . Any subject reserve right participate phone call interview ; would remain study .</detailed_description>
