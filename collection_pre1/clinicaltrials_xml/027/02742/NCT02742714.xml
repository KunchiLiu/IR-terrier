	<brief_title>PillCam SBC System Functionality Established Suspected IBD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PillCam SBC system test study , new system compose capsule , Data recorder new software Pillcam Desktop Software ( version 9.0 ) . The main feature SBC capsule panoramic field view adaptive frame rate customize complete coverage small bowel colonic mucosa . Fifty establish suspected IBD patient ( least half establish crohn disease ( CD ) ) active quiescent disease activity , age 18 year , symptomatic stricture know obstruction would prevent capsule passage enrol 6 medical site Israel Europe . Patients undergo bowel prep , follow PillCam SBC capsule examination . Patency capsule may precede PillCam SBC ingestion accord physician discretion . The PillCam Software video evaluate local site reader follow Subjective Assessment Form fulfillment .</detailed_description>
