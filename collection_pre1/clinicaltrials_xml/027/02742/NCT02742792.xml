	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate impact strength train sleep apnea elderly . Individuals age 65 80 year present apnea-hypopnea index 20 50 event per hour , measure out-of-center portable polysomnography , recruit . Those included randomize two group : Intervention : consist 12 week , twice week , strength training ; control : consist lifestyle recommendation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) disorder expose individual repeat period hypoxia awakening sleep . OSA occur one third population , constitute public health problem . The prevalence sleep apnea increase age , reach 90 % . Its consequence include sympathetic nervous system activation , increase blood pressure heart rate , myocardial contractility overload , decline parasympathetic activity , oxidative stress , systemic inflammation , platelet activation , impair vascular endothelial function . OSA risk factor hypertension , coronary artery disease , peripheral artery disease , heart failure , arrhythmia . The classical treatment option OSA use continuous positive airway pressure , oral appliance mandibular advancement , surgery , weight reduction , lifestyle change , include recommendation regular practice exercise . Physical exercise accept culturally scientifically non-pharmacological intervention beneficial health . Aerobic resistance exercise improve quality sleep . There evidence improvement general well-being , particularly sleep . Promote improve sleep exercise healthy , safe , simple . A sedentary lifestyle link high incidence severity sleep apnea . Increase number hour exercise reduces problem . Exercise use consistent result treat OSA . The effect size exercise treatment OSA range 0.4 1.5 standard deviation . In meta-analysis , total 129 participant , mean effect reduction 7 event per hour . Although result randomize clinical trial study point decrease AHI physical training , study involve adult population average age 42 54 year . The role exercise elderly OSA , affect population , remain uninvestigated . The research question : What effect strength train apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) elderly OSA ? The objective study evaluate impact strength training OSA elderly . The trial recruit individual age 65 80 year ascribe primary care unit link university hospital . Individuals accept participate study , undergo out-of-center polysomnography order detect quantify severity OSA . Individuals AHI 20 50 event per hour eligible , randomly allocate intervention control group . Randomization perform sequence number generate computer randomization.com . Individuals allocate intervention group hold two session per week strength training consist exercise leg , arm , chest , back , abdomen university Physical Education High School , 12 week . The individual allocate control group receive advice lifestyle participate meeting elderly social group basic health unit . All individual group perform evaluation consist body composition bioelectrical impedance , maximum dynamic force 1-repetition maximum strength test , quality muscle thickness ultrasound , physical function Sit-to-stand test , Timed go test Handgrip strength test . All evaluation repeat end 12-week period .</detailed_description>
