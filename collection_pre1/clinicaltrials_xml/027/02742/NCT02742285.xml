	<brief_summary>Measurement concentration antimalarial blood general population help estimate overall drug pressure use efficacy study . The current sampling standard drug measurement plasma obtain venous puncture . The use Dried Blood Spots ( DBS ) sample strategy make aspect field trial condition easy , concordance usual venous sample yet establish . The current work allow validate concentration lumefantrine measure DBS sample collect field trial validate use DBS future study . In addition , bear mind substantial deployment artemether-lumefantrine combination supply throughout malaria endemic country , study may improve understand lumefantrine artemether distribution blood compartment generate knowledge develop analytical method drug measurement . The overall purpose study validate dry blood spot sample method analysis lumefantrine . The primary objective ass concordance lumefantrine plasma dry blood spot ( DBS ) concentration . The investigator also aim describe lumefantrine 's distribution different blood compartment : binding plasma protein , total plasma , inside red blood cell , total whole blood .</brief_summary>
