	<brief_title>TAK-020 Relative Bioavailability Food Effect Study Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAK-020 develop potential treatment rheumatoid arthritis . Currently TAK-020 give oral solution . This study develop oral tablet formulation use future clinical study patient . There three part study . Part 1 compare different tablet formulation TAK-020 compare reference oral solution identify best formulation use Parts 2 3 . Part 2 look effect food TAK-020 . Part 3 optional; implementation decide upon use data Part 2 . It evaluate whether increased dos TAK-020 produce expect proportional increase plasma concentration TAK-020 . In Part 1 subject receive single dose follow : Period 1 : TAK-020 Oral Solution Period 2 : TAK-020 Co-Crystal Tablet Period 3 : TAK-020 Solid Dispersion Tablet Period 4 : TAK-020 Immediate Release Tablet In Part 2 subject split two groups; one receive choose formulation TAK-020 fast state follow fed state group receive feed state follow fasted state . The dose use Part 2 base upon data Part 1 previous study . Subjects Part 3 study split 2 cohort . Each cohort administer , fast state , single dose tablet select optimal previous study part . The dose use base upon data Parts 1 2 previous study . Part 1 assess Relative Bioavailability TAK-020 use ANOVA tmax , natural logarithm AUCs , Cmax . Part 2 ass food effect TAK-020 , also use ANOVA tmax , natural logarithm AUCs , Cmax . The power model use assess dose proportionality single dos solid formulation fast state Parts 2 3 .</detailed_description>
