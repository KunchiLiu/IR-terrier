	<detailed_description>Lentigo maligna ( LM ) form malignant melanoma situ see predominantly chronically sun-damaged skin . It find commonly head neck elderly person , peak incidence seventh eighth decade . If untreated , may develop invasive melanoma . The gold standard treatment LM surgery use 5-10 mm margin . However , lesion large , conventional surgery difficult , particularly face . Furthermore , extent LM tend underestimated exact limit lesion always easy determine . Thus , relapse repeat surgical procedure common . Moreover , LM appear elderly people often anaesthetic contraindication . When surgery feasible , superficial radiotherapy destructive treatment topical immunotherapy use imiquimod 5 % cream may use , efficacy treatment remain clearly define . Regarding use imiquimod report 15 isolated case 7 open study ( prospective ) total 189 patient . The modality use variable time day , 5 day per week 3 month . The response rate vary 53 % 100 % . The major limitation use imiquimod : 1- possible low rate remission surgery ; 2- observance topical irritating treatment extend period . Thus , need topical non-surgical treatment LM . Picato® topical gel cutaneous application contains active substance ingenol mebutate , obtain aerial part plant specie Euphorbia peplus . extraction purification . It indicate cutaneous treatment non-hyperkeratotic , non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis adult . The mechanism action ingenol mebutate actinic keratosis fully understood . In vivo vitro model show dual mechanism action : 1 ) induction local lesion cell death 2 ) promotion inflammatory response characterise infiltration immunocompetent cell . In addition effect actinic keratoses , recent study show treatment superficial basal cell carcinoma ingenol mebutate gel 500 µg/g occlusion aluminum disk , efficacious , even apply one day . On contrary , treatment 3 consecutive day show less clinical benefit seborrheic keratoses , suggest selectivity penetration variation ingenol mebutate cancer cell vs benign cell . In vitro , show ingenol mebutate able kill melanoma cell mainly induction apoptosis seem secondary activation Protein Kinase C. Based data previous study imiquimod , investigator suggest ingenol mebutate might clinical effect melanoma , particularly superficial intraepidermal lesion LM . Because lesion mostly localise face , concentration 150 µg/g test first avoid local skin secondary effect . The investigator hypothesize topical use Picato® induce cure prolong remission non-invasive LM patient eligible refuse surgery . The main objective study determine proportion patient complete response ( CR ) obtain 2 month one two cycle ( patient respond first cycle ) topical treatment IM 150 µg/g non-invasive LM face ( head neck ) . The secondary objective : 1 . To assess disease-free survival 1 2 cycle IM 150μg / g. non-invasive LM , 2 . To determine safety treatment , 3 . To evaluate diagnostic performance vivo reflectance confocal microscopy ( RCM ) High Definition Optical Coherence Tomography ( HD-OCT ) diagnosis treatment failure relapse LM compare standard represent pathological examination , monitor treatment response relapse . The patient include provide informed consent biopsy-proven non-invasive LM head ( face scalp ) eligible , refuse surgical treatment . They apply 1 cm around lesion , 0.47 g Picato® gel 150 µg/g , day 3 consecutive day . The short term efficacy evaluate 2 month , clinically ( Wood 's lamp dermoscopic examination ) histopathologically . For patient cure 2 month , long term efficacy evaluate every 6 month 36 month , use criterion . For patient partial remission 2 month , treatment apply use protocol ( 0.47 g Picato® gel 150 µg/g , day 3 consecutive day 1 cm around lesion ) . They evaluate 2 month retreatment every 6 month 36 month . The safety local side effect evaluate visit . For center equip vivo reflectance confocal microscopy ( RCM ) high-definition optical coherence tomography ( HD-OCT ) , patient image lesion technique treatment .</detailed_description>
