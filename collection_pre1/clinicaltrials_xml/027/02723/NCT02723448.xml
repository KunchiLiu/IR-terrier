	<brief_summary>The goal investigator utilize Aclarubicin treat patient Retinal Vasculopathy Cerebral Leukodystrophy ( RVCL ) , rare devastate genetic disease available specific treatment . RVCL result mutation tail end TREX1 ( Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 ) gene , major deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair enzyme . The RVCL-specific mutation cause expression truncate mislocalized protein . RVCL inherit disorder whose symptom begin middle age initially predominantly affect eye brain . Because 'autosomal dominant ' disease , strike male female equally . A person RVCL 50-50 chance transmit gene child . The investigator 's publish study demonstrate mouse model RVCL vitro study patient ' cell defect correct use Aclarubicin , anthracycline antibiotic often used treat cancer . Thus , strong rationale conduct clinical trial aclarubicin patient RVCL . The dosage initially administer RVCL patient initially &lt; 10 % typically used cancer therapeutic give monthly four consecutive day six month . Patients undergo assessment every six month determine disease response . Patients clear objective response may dose escalate 1 dose level permission principal investigator permit patient previously experience toxicity require dose modification . We evaluate safety clinical efficacy Aclarubicin treatment RVCL evaluate effect cellular function . This work generate first clinical research data investigational product 's utility treating RVCL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aclarubicin Treatment Retinal Vasculopathy With Cerebral Leukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinal vasculopathy cerebral leukodystrophy ( RVCL ) rare uniformly fatal genetic condition affect microvasculature . Symptoms begin adulthood ( usually 40 ) include loss vision , mini-strokes , dementia . RVCL include three condition previously think distinct : hereditary endotheliopathy , retinopathy , nephropathy , stroke ( HERNS ) ; cerebroretinal vasculopathy ( CRV ) ; hereditary vascular retinopathy ( HVR ) . RVCL inherit autosomal dominant manner cause carboxyl ( C ) -terminal heterozygous frameshift ( f ) mutation TREX1 ( Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 ) . There treatment RVCL , symptomatic management . TREX1 endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) -associated ( i.e. , intracellular ) enzyme , addition DNA repair activity , may regulate sugar metabolism ER . TREX1 mutation also associate several autoimmune autoinflammatory disease . In RVCL , fs mutation TREX1 result C-terminal truncation dysregulates oligosaccharyltransferase ( OST ) complex lead free glycan release dolichol carrier . In mouse model patient-derived cell , inhibit OST aclarubicin may correct glycan immune defect associate fs mutation TREX1 ( Hasan , M. et al. , Immunity 43 : 1-12 , 2015 ) . Aclarubicin ( aka aclacinomycin , aclacinomycin-A ) anthracycline antibiotic isolated Streptomyces galilaeus culture . Aclarubicin show broad spectrum anti-tumor activity . Aclarubicin utilized treatment various cancer Phase 1 2 study United States American ( USA ) 1980 's 1990 's . While longer clinically employ USA , commonly use China Japan , often part combination drug therapy program certain malignancy . Aclarubicin typically administer 3-5 consecutive day , however , alternative schedule weekly monthly evaluate . In solid tumor , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 4-day dose 30 mg/m2/day ; marrow suppression dose limiting , otherwise regimen well tolerate . Additionally , Phase II study acute myeloblastic leukemia conduct use 100mg/m2 per day three day repeat day 14-16 marrow hypoplasia produce . Toxic effect regimen include severe neutropenia , nasea/vomiting , diarrhea . No change note leave ventricular ejection fraction cardiac symptom develop . RVCL cause fs mutation C-terminus TREX1 result low-grade free glycan release , immune activation , possibly autoantibody production due part dysregulation OST complex . Inhibiting OST aclarubicin corrects glycan immune defect mouse model patient-derived cell . Thus , inhibit OST aclarubicin might therapeutic option patient RVCL . Given poor prognosis RVCL , lack treatment option , pre-clinical data OST inhibition aclarubicin mouse , strong rationale conduct clinical trial aclarubicin patient RVCL . In pilot study , aclarubicin administer initially &lt; 10 % single-agent maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oncology study . Assessments make every six month objective study . Patients clear objective response may dose escalate 1 dose level permission principal investigator permit patient previously experience toxicity require dose modification . A patient clear objective progression time may also dose escalate long complete 1 full cycle current dose level . Maximum dose level 24 mg/m2/day . The aim aclarubicin administration RVCL induce apoptosis , oncology study , rather modulate intracellular function , thus , reduce dose utilized .</detailed_description>
