	<brief_title>Study Prognostic Factors Distal Epiphysis Tibia Fracture Prognosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Epiphyseal Epiphyseal plate immature skeletal growth mechanism , epiphyseal plate injury also know epiphyseal injury , fracture line epiphyseal plate also spread epiphysis metaphysis . Epiphyseal plate 's connection weaker normal tendon , ligament , joint capsule , child epiphyseal injury common . Distal tibial epiphyseal injury account 25 % - 38 % epiphyseal injury . Because injury distal epiphysis tibia injury often lead growth retardation joint deformity , patient 's physical mental damage large . Because complexity pathogenesis disease , many related factor . The research related factor disease benefit evaluate prognosis , conducive early intervention , benefit avoid occurrence development severe sequela , positive significance clinical practice . Because disease relate many factor , serious case disease less , multi center cooperation conducive collection sufficient case analyze achieve objective effective result , establish multi center topic . Design overview In epiphyseal growth stage , epiphyseal plate connects weaker normal tendon , ligament , joint capsule , epiphyseal plate vulnerable injure . Every epiphyseal complex compose epiphysis epiphyseal plate , growth blood supply interdependent , damage may reinforce . The Ranvier district around epiphysis ability ossify . It easy form bone bridge growth arrest angular deformity injury . Epiphyseal fracture belong intra-articular fracture , timely reset , prone complication . About 15 % child fracture involve epiphyseal injury , number boy girl , chance injury , men 's epiphyseal plate closure time late woman 's . X-ray manifestation epiphyseal injury , complex , epiphyseal backbone correspond position dislocation epiphyseal line broaden important , slight shift ( ) epiphyseal line broaden easy ignore , X-ray healthy side time . In theory , fracture involve epiphyseal growth plate articular surface easily occur two kind complication : first distal tibia epiphyseal premature closure cause valgus varus malleolus limb shortening ; second distal tibial articular surface damage cause ankle joint degenerative change bone arthritis . According Salter Harris bone epiphysis injury type divide five type , distal tibial epiphysis injury I , II type common clinic . Therefore , big problem formation bone bridge , early epiphyseal closure , result growth arrest , angular deformity . From current literature , important related factor injure mechanism degree displacement Leary JT 's research show : initial fracture displacement damage mechanism determine development PPC fracture epiphysis distal end tibia may significant predictive value . Ankle fracture Lauge - Hansen part ankle fracture classification system put forward Lauge - Hansen doctor 1950 accord damage position violence cause deformity , able quickly assess damage mechanism 90 % - 95 % case , widely use . Its clinical significance lie : 1 find fracture classify injury able make diagnosis ligament injury . 2 guide manipulative reduction . The general principle : closed manipulative reduction fracture opposite force mechanism.3 distal tibial epiphysis fracture , also understand severity injury existence risk soft tissue embed . Therefore , think , necessary research lauge Hansen classification correlation prognosis . The relationship fracture displacement correlation prognosis extent shift , vast majority doctor think less 2mm shift accept , shift 2mm , different opinion . Gonc U et al think ankle joint fracture usually involve tibia fibular epiphysis child adolescent . Although occur growth arrest , may still lead traumatic arthritis . Therefore , 2 mm residual displacement need surgical treatment . And David podeszwa Da think great 3mm residual displacement often mean embedded soft tissue , may increase early closure epiphysis probability . Russo F pessimistic , think shift S - H type â…¡ tibial distal epiphyseal fracture challenge problem . Rate epiphyseal early closure high ( &gt; 43 % ) . Even incision anatomical repositioning , removal embed organization , also reduce incidence PPC , may increase risk subsequent surgery . Considered design , JOHN A.O GDEN point `` epiphyseal separation reset soon possible , delay 1 increase difficulty repair soon . For type II epiphyseal injury 10 , n't use excessive force make manual reduction success , however could damage cartilage epiphyseal plate damage early osteotylus , therefore , type II epiphyseal injury see doctor later ( ( 7-10 ) , good let malunion , use powerful technique surgical repositioning , l cause obvious epiphyseal growth stop , heals residual deformity use appropriate correction osteotomy '' . This view widely agree . In inclusion criterion choose case injury within 7 day . In addition , Risser ilium epiphyseal ossification sign commonly use method determination bone age , JiShiJun 's pediatric bone science think `` ossification crista iliaca usually conformity stop limb ' longitudinal growth '' , important index determine growth potential include exclude criterion topic , reason believe Risser sign V degrees distal tibial epiphyseal growth stop , fix limb length Angle . Grouping Divide patient group accord residual displacement fracture first manual reduction . Group A : residual displacement less equal 2mm , select close reduction external fixation ( splint , plaster traction , frame external fixation , etc . ) Group B : residual shift 2-4mm , manual reset , still 2-4mm , cooperation unit choose close reduction . Group C : residual shift 2-4mm , manual reset , still 2-4mm , cooperation unit choose close reduction . Group D : residual displacement great 4mm , open reduction internal fixation . Evaluation criterion According OVADIA et al ' evaluation criterion : excellent , Joint function restore basic consistent healthy side , without symptom , joint flexion range 75 % healthy side , mild sore swollen walking , restore normal work ; Good , joint flexion range 50 % - 70 % healthy side , joint mild soreness , markedly swollen walking , unable attend heavy physical work ; Can , joint flexion range 25 % - 50 % healthy side , joint obvious swell pain , difficulty walking , accept joint arthrodesis end ; Poor , joint range less 25 % healthy side , joint markedly swell , pain , stiffness , unable walk , accept joint arthrodesis end . Data collection To hospital conventional laboratory test , X-ray anteroposterior lateral film affect side , contralateral tibiofibula ( include ankle ) posteroanterior radiograph pelvis , scan affect ankle CT ( fracture displacement measurement , tibial epiphyseal radius vector transverse diameter cross section ) . Select case accord inclusion criterion , exclusion criterion Divide patient group accord X-ray film affect side , degree displacement measure residual displacement first manual reduction . Treated accord grouping , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 1-5 year surgery follow-up.Between 3 12 month , time X-ray film take ankle , observe whether early closure epiphysis ; 1 5 year , time measure whether tibia shorten angle , OVADIA efficacy assessment ankle function evaluation ( use table `` AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale `` ) , 5 year long distal tibial epiphyseal closure side . Organization implementation The project write Foshan Hospital TCM pediatric orthopaedic submit south pediatric orthopaedic multicenter study group . The project design discuss , modify hospital expert . The project submit approval hospital medical ethic committee . Then various unit sign cooperation agreement expert determine clear scientific , feasibility topic , study register United States NIH ClinicalTrials.gov website update accord situation . In process implementation , southern pediatric orthopaedic multicenter study group communicate consult timely solve problem difficulty appear research email , WeChat phone , even business trip mean collaboration , besides plenary meeting quarter , ensure implementation project . Data collection management Statistic analysis Foshan Hospital TCM pediatric orthopaedic formulate tibial distal epiphyseal fracture track table send every cooperative unit record whether patient epiphyseal close early , , record shortening length affect limb angle angulation deformity , record ankle limb function ( valgus , varus back stretch , plantar flexion ) , assess pain index rank accord evaluation criterion OVADIA etc . During implementation project , data fill table timely , accurately objectively cooperative unit , keep record item shall seriously omission , regular follow-up . At time , set monitor , regularly randomly go test center check ensure original data real effective . Accounting personnel choose Foshan Hospital TCM double entry , ensure data entry correct . If doubt , monitor investigate return data . Use SPSS16.0 input data , describe normal measurement data mean + / - standard deviation , average group test , count data , chi-square , finally Logistic regression model analysis multi-factor .</detailed_description>
