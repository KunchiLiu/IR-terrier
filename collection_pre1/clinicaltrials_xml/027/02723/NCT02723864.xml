	<brief_summary>Background : The drug cisplatin treat certain cancer give chemotherapy drug . Researchers think combine cisplatin 2 drug could block protein support cancer cell growth . The drug ABT-888 ( veliparib ) VX-970 . They want test drug combination slow growth cancer safe . Objectives : To test safety tolerability VX-970 veliparib combine cisplatin people advance refractory solid tumor . To determine maximum tolerate dose drug . Eligibility : People age 18 older : - Solid tumor progress treatment treatment exist - Normal organ marrow function Design : Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - CT scan MRI - Blood urine test Participants get study drug 3-week cycle : - Cisplatin vein 1 2 day - VX-970 vein 2 day - Veliparib mouth twice day 6 day In cycle , participant 5 physical exam blood test 5 time . In cycle , participant CT scan MRIs . In cycle 1 , participant may 2 tumor biopsy . A small piece tissue remove needle . Participants keep study diary . They write take drug side effect . Participants stay study long tolerate drug tumor get bad . Participants phone call month last dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib ( ABT-888 ) , Oral PARP Inhibitor , VX-970 , ATR Inhibitor , Combination With Cisplatin People With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Ataxia-telangiectasia-related ( ATR ) protein kinase central DNA damage response homologous recombination , activate series phosphorylation cascade , culminate cell cycle arrest allow time DNA repair . ATR additionally facilitate homologous recombination repair modulation p53-replication protein A ( p53-RPA ) complex bound ssDNA DNA repair process . - Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase-1 ( PARP-1 ) play pivotal role base-excision repair single strand break form either due direct genotoxic stress process double strand break . PARP also play role alternative end joining , may contribute combination activity . PARP-1 binding site DNA damage result activation catalytic activity generation chain poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ated polymer , serve dock site recruitment DNA repair protein . - Veliparib ( ABT-888 ) potent PARP 1/2 inhibitor clinical evidence potentiation antitumor activity combination cisplatin BRCA mutation carrier patient sporadic triple-negative breast cancer . - VX-970 potent ATR inhibitor , IC ( 50 ) 20 nM antitumor activity across broad range cell line combination DNA damaging agent . Preclinical study show VX-970 synergizes cisplatin induce DNA damage antitumor activity . The addition PARP inhibitor veliparib ATR inhibitor VX-970 allow impairment DNA repair , induction BRCA null phenotype , potentiation antitumor activity cisplatin . Primary Objective : -To establish safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination VX-970 veliparib combination cisplatin patient advance refractory solid tumor Secondary Objectives : - To assess effect combination VX-970 , veliparib , cisplatin marker DNA damage apoptosis - To assess antitumor activity combination Eligibility : - Patients must histologically confirm solid tumor standard therapy know prolong survival fail metastatic setting , standard therapy exist - Patients must major surgery , radiation , chemotherapy within 3 week prior enter study - Patients must adequate organ function Study Design : - VX-970 administer intravenously Days 2 9 21-day cycle . Veliparib administer orally twice day ( q12 hour +/- 1 hour ) Days 1-3 8-10 21-day cycle . Cisplatin administer 40 mg/m2 intravenously Day 1 ( Day 8 DL3 onwards ) 21-day cycle . - The escalation portion trial follow standard 3+3 design , whereby patient dose escalate cohort 3 dose-limiting toxicity observe - Once MTD establish , 15 additional patient enrolled expansion phase MTD . Mandatory tumor biopsy obtain expansion phase ass PD endpoint</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm solid tumor standard therapy know prolong survival fail metastatic set standard therapy exist . Tumor amenable biopsy willingness undergo tumor biopsy VX970 treatment expansion phase trial ( biopsy optional escalation phase ) . Patients must complete chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , biologic therapy great equal 3 week ( great equal 5 halflives , whichever short ) prior enter study . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND/Phase 0 study great equal 1 week since palliative radiation therapy . Patients must recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event . Age great equal 18 year age . ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( OR &lt; 3X ULN set liver metastasis ) creatinine less equal 1.5X institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal The effect VX970 veliparib develop human fetus unknown . For reason cisplatin know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 6 month complete study treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 6 month completion administration study agent . HIVpositive subject combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction VX970 . In addition , subject increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Patients must able swallow whole tablet capsule . Nasogastric Gtube administration allow . Any gastrointestinal disease would impair ability swallow , retain , absorb drug allow . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . During expansion phase protocol , patient must disease amenable biopsy willing undergo pre posttreatment biopsy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know active brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial . Patients whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 4 week follow treatment brain metastasis eligible participate discretion principal investigator . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active untreated infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients require concomitant medication exclude . Pregnant woman woman breastfeed exclude study effect study drug develop fetus unknown . Patients prior platinumbased therapy &gt; Grade 1 neurotoxicity ototoxicity time enrollment permit study . Patients seizure history permit protocol due association veliparib seizure activity animal toxicology study higher dos . Patients anticonvulsant medication permit study due potential low plasma level anticonvulsant risk seizure activity . Patients expansion cohort undergo tumor biopsy may anticoagulant due risk thrombocytopenia treatment risk bleeding .</criteria>
