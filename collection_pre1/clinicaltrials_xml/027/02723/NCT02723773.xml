	<criteria>Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol ( e.g. , completion diary card , return followup visit , ability schedule contact allow evaluation study ) . Or subject caregiver , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol ( e.g. , completion diary card , availability followup contact ) . Written inform consent obtain subject prior performance study specific procedure . Subject participate ZOSTER006 ZOSTER022 study receive least one dose HZ/su vaccine . Additional inclusion criterion 1Additional Dose Revaccination Control group , ONLY : Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series . Use investigational nonregistered product ( pharmaceutical product device ) time enrolment plan use study period . Previous vaccination Varicella Zoster Virus ( VZV ) HZ and/or plan administration study VZV HZ vaccine ( include investigational nonregistered vaccine HZ/su vaccine administer study ZOSTER006/022 ) . Chronic administration ( defined ≥ 14 consecutive day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug period start six month prior Visit Month 0 study ZOSTER049 expect administration time study period . For corticosteroid , mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day equivalent . A prednisone dose &lt; 20 mg/day allow . Inhaled , topical intraarticular corticosteroid allow . Administration longacting immunemodifying drug ( e.g. , infliximab , rituximab ) within 6 month prior Visit Month 0 study ZOSTER049 expect administration time study period . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition result disease ( e.g. , malignancy , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] infection ) immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy ( e.g. , medication use cancer chemotherapy , organ transplantation treat autoimmune disorder ) . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 3 month prior Visit Month 0 study ZOSTER049 plan administration study period . Prolonged use ( &gt; 14 consecutive day ) oral and/or parenteral antiviral agent active VZV ( acyclovir , valacyclovir , famciclovir , etc . ) plan use study period indication treat suspect confirmed HZ HZrelated complication ( topical use antiviral agent allow ) . Important underlying illness opinion investigator would expect interfere significantly study . Additional exclusion criterion 1Additional Dose Revaccination Control group , : Subjects experience SAE first vaccination previous ZOSTER006/022 study enrolment study ZOSTER049 consider related study vaccine either investigator sponsor . Subjects new onset pIMD exacerbation pIMD first vaccination previous ZOSTER006/022 study enrolment study ZOSTER049 . Use investigational nonregistered product ( pharmaceutical product device ) within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine plan use study period . Administration plan administration immunization within 30 day first study vaccination schedule within 30 day study vaccination . However , license nonreplicating vaccine ( i.e. , inactivate subunit vaccine , include inactivated subunit influenza vaccine seasonal pandemic flu , without adjuvant ) may administer 8 day prior dose and/or least 14 day dose study vaccine . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine . Additionally , consider allergic reaction material equipment relate study participation ( material may possibly contain latexgloves , syrinx , etc. ) . Please note , vaccine vial study contain latex . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution ( childbearing potential ) .
