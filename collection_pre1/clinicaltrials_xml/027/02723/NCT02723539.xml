In Part I , patient enrol escalate dose cohort ( 150 , 375 , 600 µg/mL ) ( N=16/cohort ) ratio 3:1 ( Active Placebo ) . In Part II , patient randomize 1:1 ratio ( Active Placebo ) base optimal dose demonstrate Part I . Patients diabetes mellitus foot infection Infectious Disease Society America ( IDSA ) infection severity rating moderate severe eligible trial . Both inpatient outpatient eligible meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , however enrolled patient must remain in-hospital first 24 hour initial dose . Patients need surgical therapy ( e.g. , incision drainage removal necrotic tissue ) beyond standard bedside wound debridement enrol . Patients randomize receive either topical application MBN-101 topical application vehicle , apply directly target site , 3 time per week , minimum 14 day maximum 21 day .
