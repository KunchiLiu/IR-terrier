	<brief_title>Comparison Electrical Pudendal Nerve Stimulation Tolterodine Tartrate Urgency-Frequency Syndrome Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tolterodine Tartrate one first-line medication treatment Urgency-frequency syndrome ( UFS ) patient . It report reduce frequency urgency nocturia urinary leakage patient UFS . However dry mouth constipation frequently report adverse event . In report blur vision increase heart rate also report . The side effect limit application . Electrical neuromodulation prove valuable patient UFS little adverse effect . The investigator previously report electrical pudendal nerve stimulation ( EPNS ) alone long term effect treatment UFS woman patient . EPNS develop combine advantage pudendal nerve stimulation ( PNS ) percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) , incorporate technique deep insertion long acupuncture needle . Because pudendal nerve ( PN ) afferents particularly important inhibitory effect void reflex SNS excite part PN afferent , direct PN stimulation may effective . PNS use treat UFS refractory SNS , therapy also disadvantage similar SNS . PTNS minimally invasive , demonstrate efficacy , easily applicable well tolerate , result chronic PTNS treatment unknown initially successful patient PTNS effect diminish time . In EPNS , long acupuncture needle 0.40 Ð¥ 100 125 mm deeply inserted four sacral point electrify stimulate pudendal nerve . CT transverse plane coccygeal apex show position lower needle tip similar ( adjacent PN Alcock 's canal ) Bion device implant chronic PN stimulation . Besides radiographic evidence , simultaneous record perineal ultrasonographic PFM contraction , vaginal pressure pelvic floor surface electromyogram investigator previous study prove EPNS exactly excite PN . The investigator previous study also prove EPNS good post-treatment effect UFS woman . The purpose present study show long-term efficacy EPNS UFS woman .</detailed_description>
