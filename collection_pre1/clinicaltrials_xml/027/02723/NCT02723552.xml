	<detailed_description>DESIGN TEPHRA randomize control trial investigate cardiovascular effect ( blood pressure , structure , function ) aerobic exercise intervention young adult elevate blood pressure . The trial compare outcomes premature born participant v full-term born participant . SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION 1 4 adult develop high blood pressure , risk factor heart disease stroke . Although high blood pressure become common young adult , recent literature review show research exercise blood pressure focus old population . The effect exercise blood pressure preterm bear young adult well studied report . Most baby bear full term ( 37-42 week gestation ) 1 10 baby bear early ( preterm ) . Evidence suggest preterm birth may associate high blood pressure difference size , shape function heart blood vessel . These difference may alter person 's blood pressure cardiovascular system respond exercise . These factor contribute investigator pursue research study . The trial vehicle learn hypertension young adult exercise help reduce blood pressure . It investigate structure function cardiovascular system respond exercise . It specifically seek improve understand birth history , born premature may influence blood pressure response exercise training . This trial seek illuminate clinically relevant information one prevalent diseases UK ( hypertension ) . BACKGROUND AND AIMS 1 10 baby bear preterm study identify preterm birth associate increase risk high blood pressure reduce exercise capacity . This trial aim advance understand aerobic exercise affect blood pressure cardiovascular structure function adult age 18-35 different birth background . PARTICIPANTS : 200 participant ( 100 preterm bear &amp; 100 full term bear ) age 18-35 elevated blood pressure . RECRUITMENT : 1 . Open advertising 2 .

Completion Study The participant information leaflet inform consent process clearly explain intend outcome study participant information store . At end study , study team coordinate dissemination data study via journal abstract , article , oral/written presentation . Any scientific publication arise study available request participant well summary main finding . CONSIDERATION OF NULL HYPOTHESES A null hypotheses `` sustained aerobic exercise reduce blood pressure preterm bear young adult '' select . Rather , study older cohort ( birth background assess ) strongly suggest regular aerobic exercise blood pressure reduce effect . Previous research identify difference structure function heart blood vessel preterm bear young adult vs full term bear . Accordingly , hypothesis `` regular aerobic exercise elicit different blood pressure lower effect premature bear young adult elevate blood pressure v full-term born young adult elevate blood pressure '' test study . SAMPLE SIZE SELECTION Recent systematic review meta-analysis randomise control trial identify average decrease 5.4mmHg systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) post-intervention via supervise exercise young adult prehypertension ( mean systolic blood pressure baseline 126 mmHg ) . The post intervention standard deviation change 8.7 mmHg . The investigator ' available cross-sectional pilot data suggest change high preterm bear participant participant expose maternal hypertension pregnancy . To calculate sample size , investigator use estimate change 5 mmHg follow 4 month intervention . The investigator use SD 11.3 pool SD ambulatory systolic blood pressure cross-sectional pilot data . To observe treatment effect systolic blood pressure 5mmHg , power 80 % ( p=0.05 ) require total sample size 164 participant . The SD deviation pool 24 hour awake diastolic blood pressure 8.3 mmHg . To observe treatment effect diastolic blood pressure 5mmHg , power 80 % ( p=0.05 ) require total sample size 114 participant . The power calculation systolic blood pressure use determine final sample size , adjustment 200 participant allow 18 % attrition . To ensure primary objective study answer study team may recruit additional participant replace drop study . WHY THE DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY WAS SELECTED The TEPHRA design methodology select build two closely related ongoing study , EXPRESSO YACHT2 ( summarise ) . EXPRESSO YACHT2 collect data provide significant insight good characterize activity norm cardiovascular system young adult various birth background . TEPHRA advance research theme employ intervention arm ( aerobic exercise ) investigate effect exercise blood pressure structure function cardiovascular system . JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUDING A CONTROL ARM Previous study identify anatomical functional difference cardiovascular system preterm born young adult compare full-term born control . The investigator seek understand clinical significance difference , response treatment ( case exercise ) properly assess compare preterm bear cohort control . MINIMISATION OF RESEARCHER EFFECTS AND BIAS Due nature intervention ( supervised exercise session vs `` normal '' activity level ) , TEPHRA unblinded trial . However , numerous measure take minimize investigator effect include : - All MRI sub-study image assess investigator blind participant detail -- All image ( ie . Ultrasound heart small blood vessel image ) assess investigator blind participant detail - Analysis blood sample complete laboratory investigator blind participant detail - Intervention support protocol standardise participant - The intervention team field lead ( conduct gym visit etc . ) blind participant detail collect primary study measure STUDY PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION SCREENING VISITS Screening Visit Procedures ( Visit 0 , total time 1 hour ) Height , weight , body composition , blood pressure collect . The investigator also ask candidate provide information medical history physical activity , birth history . - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( 20 Minutes ) An ECG , accomplish check basic heart function place 12 sticky pad chest record electrical signal heart make beat . If desire , investigator arrange candidate 's preference male female investigator set ECG . The ECG take 20 minute review trained physician . Provided candidate happy continue exclusionary criterion meet , investigator would fit candidate 24 hour blood pressure monitor . - Fitting 24 hour monitoring equipment ( 5 minute ) If screen indicates candidate may good fit trial , study team also ask candidate wear blood pressure monitor 24 hour . It consist blood pressure cuff worn upper arm easily fit clothing . The cuff attach lead small box slightly large deck card . This place pocket attach belt provide research team . The cuff inflate deflate every 30 minute day every 60 minute night measure blood pressure . It unlikely disturb sleep participant ask power monitor driving ( research team show turn device ) . A postage pay , address envelope provide return monitor . If screening measure indicate candidate good , safe match trail would like proceed , investigator arrange convenient time meet main trial visit Cardiovascular Clinical Research Facility John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford . MAIN STUDY VISITS COMPLETION OF STUDY VISITS 1-3 ( 3 hour per visit ) There three main visit plan participant : - Visit 1 : conduct begin trial ( baseline ) - Visit 2 : conduct ~16 week trial ( visit coincide completion structure exercise intervention ) - Visit 3 : conduct 52 week ( end trial ) Note - If Visit 1 within 30 day screen participant change medical physical activity status , basic physical measure ( ie . 24 hour blood pressure body composition ) re-assessed . Apart note exception , assessment repeat trial visit 1-3 . Participants ask water 4 hour visit - Questionnaire ( 30 minute ) This collect detailed information physical activity also lifestyle information daily routines use alcohol tobacco . - Physical Measures ( 15 minute ) ( note , baseline visit within 30 day screen , measure repeat ) . THe investigator measure blood pressure ask participant walk flat 10 meter wear belt-mounted sensor . The participant ask give urine sample test presence protein indicator cardiovascular blood vessel function relate blood pressure . - Cardiovascular Measures ( 45 minute ) - Small vessel image The investigator use special camera take picture blood vessel participant ' retina . This simple , non-invasive procedure use special camera look pupil observe blood vessel back eye . This painless require physical contact eye . The investigator may also use special microscope take video image small blood vessel back finger . This also painless , non-invasive procedure . - Vascular stiffness measurement The investigator measure stiffness blood vessel place inflatable cuff one arm also one knee . This also painless , non-invasive procedure . - Echocardiogram The investigator perform ultrasound ( Echocardiogram `` ECHO '' ) heart . Participants ask disrobe waist put hospital gown untied front allow study investigator access place ultrasound probe chest . Participants lie pad treatment table leave side . The probe place chest lubricate jelly use probe make good contact skin . Ultrasound wave create image heart scanner monitor . The research team train perform echocardiogram , ensure privacy maintain throughout visit . Participants request gender echocardiographer perform echocardiogram . - Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing ( 50 minute ) During exercise testing , participant ask donate total 150mLs ( 8 9 tablespoon ) blood trial visit . The blood sample store analysed natural compound gene involve blood vessel function cardiovascular disease development . To allow collection blood sample , cannula place vein participant ' hand arm . The cannula small , flexible plastic tube insert use needle allows collection blood without need multiple needle prick . It also possible conventional blood sampling , involve number needle prick , preferred participant . Exercise test allow assessment heart lung function exercise test use athlete see well respond exercise . The exercise test perform stationary bike . We ask participant wear appropriate clothing exercise short loose fit track trouser comfortable top ( hospital scrub available need ) . Participants breathe open mask worn mouth nose whilst exercise allow measurement oxygen use fitness . Participants may stop test time reason . As cycle bike , body response heart rate blood pressure record . Participants wear blood pressure cuff one arm inflate occasionally throughout cycle test . The investigator place three small sticky pad participant ' back record ECG test . The exercise test last approximately 10-15 minute participant pedal gradually increase resistance . The test design increasingly difficult progress physically demand last 3-4 minute . This likely make participant feel quite exhaust , breathe heavily leg muscle may ache ( particularly accustom exercise ) . After test participant pedal minimal resistance cool . -- Blood Sampling Before , immediately follow , 20 minute exercise test cannula back hand arm use take sample blood . This allow study team measure change blood associate exercise . DATA MONITORING An independent Data Monitoring Committee monitor audit research project data collect . ANALYSIS The analysis carry basis intention-to-treat ( ITT ) . This , randomisation , participant analyse accord allocate intervention group irrespective actually receive . Patient demographic characteristic baseline information summarise treatment group . Numbers ( percentage ) binary categorical variable mean ( standard deviation ) , median ( interquartile full range ) continuous variable present . Normality variable assess visual assessment normality curve Shapiro-Wilk test . The analysis primary outcome assess use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) adjust baseline value minimisation factor use randomisation process . Results present adjusted mean difference change ambulatory blood pressure randomise group 4 month 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) associate two-sided p value . The analysis secondary outcome also do use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) establish co-variant model examine effect cardiac structure , vascular function lifestyle behaviour exercise capacity . Outcomes measure one occasion analyse use mixed effect model . If model assumption meet evidence departure Normality observe , transformation data employ non-parametric test carry . Statistical analysis carry use STATA SPSS statistical software .</detailed_description>
