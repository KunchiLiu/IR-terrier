	<brief_title>Ventral Tegmental Area ( VTA ) Self-Activation Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve screen visit 4 experimental task sessions.During screen visit subject undergo psychiatric screen determine meet criterion diagnosis ADHD . Participants meet criterion diagnosis ADHD also follow test do screening : breath alcohol test , urine drug screen urine cotinine ( product tobacco ) screen intelligence quotient ( IQ ) assessment . Eligible participant complete battery cognitive assessment . Participants meet study inclusion schedule 4 fMRI session assess manipulate ability self-stimulate VTA activation . Each session contain tasks instruction . The experimental imaging task session do 24-72 hour apart consist two type run : Test Runs ( one pre-test post-test ) three Training Runs . The purpose Pre-Test establish baseline level self-generated VTA activation prior receive RTFF . The Post-Test design assess whether participant well able self-induce VTA BOLD signal absence feedback ( receive RTFF ) . Participants begin end scan session 2-minute rest state scan . Participants rest fixate cross hair . The purpose first run acquire data functional space facilitate registration VTA probabilistic atlas ( MNI space ) functional space . The Pre-Test Post-Test run identical two trial type : Activate Count . During Activate trial participant instruct try increase activity ( BOLD signal ) within VTA . Specifically , instruct participant try get heighten state motivation use personally relevant thought imagery . Importantly , encourage optimize strategy . During Count trial , participant instruct count backwards . The purpose trial : standardize baseline period provide distractor task prevent engagement activation strategy . There 5 repetition trial type , separate jittered inter-trial-interval ( ITI ; total duration 4 minute , 5 second ) . The purpose subsequent training run ( n=3/day 4 day ) provide participant RTFF assist increase VTA BOLD signal . The training run consist three trial type : Activate , Count , Rest . For Activate Count Trials , participant give instruction test run . During Rest trial participant instruct rest think anything particular . The Activate Rest trial include thermometer display , describe . Each trial type repeat 5 time per run , separate jittered ITI ( total duration 6 minute , 18 second ) . Following Post-Test day , Cognitive Battery assessment repeat subject scanner .</detailed_description>
