	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well midostaurin work treat old patient acute myeloid leukemia change genetic material post-hematopoietic cell transplantation . Midostaruin may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving midostaruin post-transplant may improve patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Midostaurin Treating Older Patients With Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia Post-Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy safety maintenance midostaurin ( fms relate tyrosine kinase 3 [ FLT3 ] inhibitor ) elderly patient FLT3-internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) /tyrosine kinase domain ( TKD ) mutate acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) previously enrol study HEMAML0022/CPKC412AUS27T undergone allogeneic transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether maintenance midostaurin allogeneic transplant decrease relapse rate patient FLT3-ITD/TKD mutate AML . OUTLINE : Beginning 30 day post-hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) , patient receive midostaurin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 1 year .</detailed_description>
