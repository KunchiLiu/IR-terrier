	<brief_summary>Pemetrexed multitargeted antifolate , primarily inhibit thymidylate synthase , dihydrofolate reductase , glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase folate-dependent metabolic process . Nowadays , pemetrexed use treat malignant pleural mesothelioma non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer . Preclinical clinical study show pemetrexed cytotoxic activity many kind cancer include colorectal cancer . Erlotinib tyrosine-kinase inhibitor EGFR , approve treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Erlotinib also show activity colorectal cancer cell . Recently , Zhang et al . demonstrate synergistic cytotoxicity pemetrexed gefitinib preclinical study . In multicenter , non randomize , open label phase II study , investigator aim evaluate efficacy safety Pemetrexed Erlotinib combination .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female , age ≥ 19 year 2 . Histologic cytologic confirm diagnosis colorectal carcinoma metastatic ( STAGE IV ) disease . 3 . Confirmed KRAS ( codon 12 13 ) status 4 . Prior chemotherapy metastatic disease require ; prior regimen must include fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin irinotecan 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2 6 . Patients swallow oral medication . 7 . Life expectancy great 3 month 8 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3 serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal aspartate aminotransferase ( SGOT ) /alanine aminotransferase ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 X institutional upper limit normal ( ≤ 5 time upper institutional limit normal hepatic metastasis present ) serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50ml/min 9 . The effect Pemetrexed Erlotinib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , female participant child bear potential male participant whose partner child bear potential must willing ensure partner use effective contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) study 6 month thereafter . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 10 . Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Voluntary sign date write informed consent form accordance regulatory institutional guideline obtain performance protocolrelated procedure part normal patient care . 1 . Previous treatment Pemetrexed Erlotinib 2 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Pemetrexed Erlotinib agent use study 3 .
