	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacodynamics Investigational Treatments Combination With Standard Care Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Participants With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-580 , TAK-202 ( plozalizumab ) , vedolizumab . These investigational drug give along standard care checkpoint inhibitor ( [ nivolumab Arms 1 2 ] nivolumab + ipilimumab Arm 3 ) . This study look safety profile combination treatment arm administer participant advanced melanoma . The study enroll approximately 156 participant . Participants assign one 3 treatment group : - TAK-580 + nivolumab - TAK-202 ( plozalizumab ) + nivolumab - vedolizumab + nivolumab + ipilimumab This study consist 3 part . A dose-escalation safety lead-in phase , confirmatory safety phase cohort expansion phase . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 50 week . Participants may make multiple visit clinic 30 , 60 , 90 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
