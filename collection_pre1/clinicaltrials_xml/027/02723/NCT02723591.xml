	<brief_title>To Compare Effects Immediate-release Tacrolimus Astagraf XL Donor-Specific Antibody ( DSA ) Formation Development Immune Activation ( IA ) de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory , two year , prospective , randomize , multi-center , open-label trial examine long-term kidney transplant outcome use adaptive design two-part , composite surrogate endpoint . Specifically , design compare effect twice daily , immediate-release tacrolimus daily Astagraf XL DSA formation development IA de novo kidney transplant recipient first two year follow kidney transplantation . Patients screen prior surgery randomize 1:1 receive , within 48 hour transplantation , immediate-release tacrolimus , administer twice daily , Astagraf XL , component standard immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consist corticosteroid ( give per institutional protocol ) mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) ( Myfortic® equivalent ) .</detailed_description>
