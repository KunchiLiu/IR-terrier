	<brief_summary>Non-invasive respiratory support routinely provide extremely preterm infant follow disconnection mechanical ventilation , form continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) . However , mode remain sub-optimal due lack synchronization upper airway defensive mechanism potentially hind effectiveness . Non-invasive Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist ( NIV-NAVA ) novel mode may overcome problem investigated population . Investigators hypothesize significant difference cardiorespiratory behavior extremely preterm infant receive CPAP , NIPPV NIV-NAVA immediate post-extubation period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A large proportion extremely preterm infant mechanically ventilate use endotracheal intubation . However , clinician try avoid intubation due complication may arise mechanically ventilated ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) , pulmonary hemorrhage , air leak etc . In order prevent complication , clinician accelerate wean provide non-invasive respiratory support . The commonly use type non-invasive respiratory support follow extubation nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) . NCPAP show improve oxygenation , reduce airway resistance , increase tidal volume , stabilize chest wall maintain functional residual capacity . In addition NCPAP , nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) become popular choice post-extubation respiratory support mode . However , lack knowledge regard effect synchronization infant 's spontaneous respiratory effort ventilator inflation . Synchronization , especially non-invasive ventilation , difficult achieve preterm infant due rapid respiratory rate , short inspiratory time , periodic breathing , leak small tidal volume . Previous study use device abdominal capsule allow synchronization infant receive NIPPV . The abdominal capsule prone incorrect placement , time delay ineffective synchronization . Neurally Activated Ventilatory Assistance ( NAVA ) new technology use invasive non-invasive ventilation . In novel mode , electrical activity diaphragm , call EAdi , detect electrode inserted tip specialize nasogastric tube . The EAdi represent patient 's inherent neural respiratory drive . The ventilator assist spontaneous breath delivering pressure linearly proportional EAdi . The mechanical breath initiate start diaphragmatic contraction maintain EAdi 60 70 % peak pressure generate . Therefore , inspiratory time , expiratory time peak inflation pressure control determined patient , provide patient-ventilator synchrony .</detailed_description>
