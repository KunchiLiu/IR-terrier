	<brief_summary>As prostate cancer progress , tumor cell dissociate enter bloodstream . Considered `` liquid biopsy , '' circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) show patient 's cancer evolve respond treatment . The purpose study determine whether sequentially analyze expression tumor marker circulate tumor cell newly diagnose metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patient predict outcome patient .</brief_summary>
