	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiation With Concomitant Boost In Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemoradiation ( CRT ) , consider standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer positive impact locoregional control survival . However , patient T4 rectal cancer show high risk local recurrence ( LR ) conventional treatment . This prospective Phase II study patient locally advanced rectal cancer locally recurrences , evaluate efficacy term pathological response resectability concomitant boost RT ( 55 Gy/5 week ) concurrent Raltitrexed Oxaliplatin ( Tom-Ox ) chemotherapy . The primary aim assess pathological complete response rate . Key secondary aim resectability . Secondary aim evaluation treatment-related acute late toxicity , local control , disease-free survival overall survival ( OS ) . The follow-up period subject start radiochemotherapy treatment end maximum 36 month observation death .</detailed_description>
