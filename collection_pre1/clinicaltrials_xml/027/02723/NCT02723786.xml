	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics GSK1070806 subject undergoing renal transplantation . GSK1070806 anti-interleukin 18 ( IL18 ) monoclonal antibody , bind IL-18 inhibits signal IL-18 receptor . Recipients donor kidney , retrieve circulatory death donor , administer single intravenous infusion GSK1070806 test whether inhibition IL-18 reduce rate Delayed Graft Function ( DGF ) graft rejection . Subjects follow 12 month post dose/transplant . Up 40 adult subject enrol study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Recipient age range : Between 18 75 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Dialysisdependent recipient first time , single kidneyonly , Donation Circulatory Death ( DCD ) transplant . Eligible kidney transplantation : Considered eligible undergoing multidisciplinary evaluation institution transplantation perform . Immunosuppressants ( time transplantation ) : plan receive combination immunosuppressant include basiliximab , mycophenolate mofetil azathioprine , tacrolimus , corticosteroid . Male Female : 1 . Males : Male subject female partner child bear potential must utilize condom female partner must comply use highly effective contraceptive method 180 day postdose study medication . 2 . Females : Nonreproductive potential define protocol . Reproductive potential : Must pregnant lactating , agree follow one option list Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) 180 day post dose define protocol . Capable providing sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Liver function : Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2xUpper Limit Normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . QT interval : single average Corrected QT Interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 millisecond ( msec ) subject bundle branch block QTc &gt; 500 msec ( criterion apply subject predominately pace rhythm ) . Concurrent medication : Subjects receive treatment prohibit safety reason ( e.g . live vaccine , cyclophosphamide biologic immunosuppressant ) receive investigational product without explicit approval Medical Monitor ( Sponsor ) . Investigational product : Any within 5 halflives twice duration biological effect whichever longer ( investigational product refers drug approve sale country use ) . Immunosuppression : Are consider steroidfree , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) alemtuzumab induction , much profound prolong immunosuppressive effect basiliximab . Prior biologic immunosuppressive : The subject receive agent within follow time period prior day dose current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect , whichever longer . Vaccines : A live vaccine within 30 day prior GSK1070806 administration Receiving DCD kidney allograft donor follow characteristic : cold ischemic time &gt; 36 hour , age &lt; 5 year old , age &gt; 75 year old , ABO blood type incompatible recipient , T and/or Bcell positive crossmatch complement dependent cytotoxicity flow cytometry recipient ( positive crossmatch unavailable , virtual crossmatch allow ) , serology positive hepatitis B ( except hepatitis B surface antibody prior vaccination ) , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) positive donor allograft EBV negative recipient , donor acute chronic bacterial , viral fungal infection accord investigator cause risk recipient , particularly infection resistant systemic , normothermic regional machine perfusion organ retrieval technique utilize , surgical damage donor allograft organ procurement Previous organ transplantation : previously undergone organ transplantation ( exception corneal transplantation ) . Malignancy : history malignancy past 5 year except adequately treat cancer skin ( basal squamous cell ) carcinoma situ uterine cervix . Acute chronic infection : require management acute chronic infection ( excludes prophylaxis infection ) , follow : currently treat chronic infection , opinion investigator , could put subject undue risk ; hospitalize treatment infection , treat infection parenteral antibiotic ( include antibacterial , antiviral , antifungal , antiparasitic agent ) within 30 day Day 0 , opinion investigator , could put subject undue risk ; current evidence , history within last 14 day , influenzalike illness define fever ( &gt; 38 degree Celsius ) two follow symptom : cough , sore throat , runny nose , sneeze , limb / joint pain , headache , vomit / diarrhoea ; subject history active tuberculosis , recent tuberculosis exposure , judge investigator risk tuberculosis exclude study . Other disease/conditions . Has follow : clinical evidence significant unstable uncontrolled acute chronic disease , opinion investigator , could confound result study put subject undue risk ; surgical procedure plan 12 month Day 0 , kidney transplantation related procedure ; know history medical disease ( e.g. , cardiopulmonary ) , laboratory abnormality , condition ( e.g. , poor venous access ) , opinion investigator , make subject unsuitable study Hepatitis B : subject exclude evidence acute chronic infection , interpretation result unclear . This include : Hepatitis B surface Antigen ( HBsAg ) + , Anti Hepatitis B core ( AntiHBc ) + , Hepatitis B Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid ( HB DNA ) + . It permissible enroll subject antiHepatitis B ( HB ) s+ , attributable vaccination history previous infection . Hepatitis C : subject exclude evidence past current hepatitis C infection , include hepatitis C antibody , hepatitis C Recombinant ImmunoBlot Assay ( RIBA ) Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) . HIV : know historically positive HIV test . Immunodeficiency : recipient history , laboratory evidence immunodeficiency . Drug Sensitivity : history sensitivity study medication include : GSK1070806 ; background immunosuppressive regimen ; designate prophylactic antiinfective therapy component thereof , history drug allergy include previous anaphylactic reaction parenteral administration biologic therapy ( ie monoclonal antibody ) , opinion Investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Substance abuse : clinical evidence current drug alcohol abuse dependence . Co enrollment : participate another interventional study ( participation purely observational cohort study acceptable provide impair feasibility , involve excessive additional sampling ) . Compliance : unlikely comply schedule study visit base investigator judgment history psychiatric disorder condition may compromise communication investigator .</criteria>
