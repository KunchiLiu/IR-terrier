	<detailed_description>As critical member adhesion molecule integrin family important representative angiogenesis-related molecular , integrin αvβ3 express low level mature endothelial cell normal cell , overexpressed neovasculature endothelial cell , high specificity affinity bind tri-peptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) . Angiogenesis synovial membrane play important role pathogenesis rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Therefore , radiolabeled RGD peptide use molecular probe radionuclide image assess angiogenesis noninvasively vitro investigate progress RA , achieve goal early diagnosis efficacy evaluation RA . Accordingly , variety radiolabeled RGD peptide use radiotracers target integrin αvβ3 expression ass angiogenesis vitro noninvasive imaging via PET ( positron emission tomography ) SPECT ( single photon emission compute tomography ) . Some radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptide , 18F-Galacto-RGD , 18F-AH111585 99mTc-NC100692 , investigate clinical trial . The result demonstrate radiotracers allow specific image various type tumor , tumor uptake correlate well expression integrin αvβ3 animal model patient . Recently , several RGD dimeric peptide PEG linkers study . The new type RGD peptides show much high vitro integrin αvβ3-binding affinity single RGD tri-peptide sequence , importantly , exhibit significantly increase tumor uptake improve vivo kinetics animal model . As representative , 99mTc-3PRGD2 could easily prepare exhibited excellent vivo behavior animal model . No adverse reaction observe animal model date . 99mTc-3PRGD2 , novel tracer target integrin αvβ3 receptor , try use tumor recent year . However , study 99mTc-3PRGD2 disease except tumor , especially relevant report rheumatoid arthritis . Therefore , investigator expect expand application 99mTc-3PRGD2 disease provide new method thought assess efficacy anti-αvβ3 anti-angiogenesis therapy rheumatoid arthritis . Based investigator previous animal study 99mTc-3PRGD2 RA , investigator strong interest clinical trial 99mTc-3PRGD2 . An open-label SPECT/CT study design investigate 99mTc-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT diagnosis efficacy evaluation RA . A single dose nearly 11.1MBq/kg body weight 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤20µg 3PRGD2 ) intravenously injected patient . Visual semiquantitative method use ass whole-body planar lesion section SPECT/CT image . Adverse event also observe patient .</detailed_description>
