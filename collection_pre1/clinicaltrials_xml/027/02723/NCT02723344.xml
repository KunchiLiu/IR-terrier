	<brief_title>Biological Signatures , Probiotic Among Those With mTBI PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>United States military Veterans recent conflict cop symptom relate mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) , persistent post concussive ( PPC ) symptom , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Many Veterans resistant conventional health mental health intervention ( e.g. , medication , psychotherapy ) , often symptoms significantly improve traditional treatment . Moreover , limited treatment symptom associated condition , frequently co-occur . Alternative treatment method need . One potential common underlying feature mTBI PTSD exaggerate inflammation , peripherally central nervous system , think play important role vulnerability , aggravation , perpetuation adverse consequence often co-occurring condition . Therefore , novel intervention strategy would use immunoregulatory/anti-inflammatory probiotic reduce inflammation . In study , investigator investigate effect immunoregulatory probiotic biological signature systemic inflammatory process proximal signature probiotic administration . Lactobacillus reuteri ( L. reuteri ) , commensal organism colonize human gut mucosa , suppress mucosal inflammation via inhibition production proinflammatory cytokine , probiotic interest . Specific aim study determine : 1 ) effect L. reuteri biological signature gut microbiota , gut permeability , systemic inflammation process , stress response ; 2 ) feasibility L. reuteri supplementation ; 3 ) acceptability L. reuteri supplementation ; 4 ) tolerability safety L. reuteri supplementation . Project aim assess use longitudinal , double blind , randomize placebo-controlled design . Participants Veterans PPC symptom , PTSD , evidence elevate systemic inflammation ( base high baseline plasma C-reactive protein [ CRP ] concentration ) . After initial evaluation procedure , 20 participant randomize probiotic supplementation 20 randomize placebo supplementation . The proposed line research address Office Rehabilitation Research Development ( RR &amp; D ) Service 's goal identifying mean intervening increase function among mTBI co-occurring psychiatric condition . Long-term , study may lead paradigm shift manner investigator target clinical symptom associate PPC PTSD symptom , begin process support multitargeted , neuroprotective approach .</detailed_description>
