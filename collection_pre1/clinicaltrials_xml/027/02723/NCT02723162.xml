	<brief_summary>This study examine effect combine Varenicline ( VRN ) N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) neural circuitry function treat nicotine addiction . Healthy adult nicotine dependent cigarette smoker interested quitting ( n=110 ) randomize one four PBO-controlled condition 4 week : 1 ) VRN+NAC , 2 ) VRN+PBO , 3 ) NAC+PBO 4 ) PBO+PBO . Following 1 week medication , participant contingently reinforce 3 day smoke abstinence scan use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technique , nicotine deprive rest state cue-reactivity ( CR ) task . Participants follow next 3 week treatment clinical variable assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cigarette ( henceforth nicotine ) addiction chronic , relapse brain disorder remain lead preventable cause death disability US , cost nearly $ 200 billion year . Although ~20 % adult USA currently smoke , majority want quit . In spite breadth research focus improve health outcome reduce societal burden cause nicotine addiction , majority smoker attempt quit relapse . Nicotine withdrawal-related disturbance executive function , negative affect reward process compel smoker self-administer nicotine—each turn represent loss control remain abstinent risk factor relapse . Thus , identify effect nicotine addiction mechanism self-regulation , value novel medication remediate dysregulated behavior need order enhance intervention treat nicotine addiction . The preliminary data , along extant literature , suggest maintenance nicotine addiction subserve dysregulated neural function limbic-striatal corticostriatal neural circuitry . While VRN may effective treat limbic-striatal circuitry associate promote abstinence reduce acute withdrawal ; NAC may effective treat corticostriatal circuitry function associate relapse vulnerability . Thus , current proposal seek investigate two medication ( VRN &amp; NAC ) , potentially complementary effect two different brain circuits— limbic-striatal ( VRN ) corticostriatal ( NAC ) circuitry—and may therapeutically target two different phase recovery nicotine addiction—the promotion abstinence ( VRN ) relapse prevention ( NAC ) . The placebo ( PBO ) -controlled design proposal allow team identify translate neurobiological substrate neurocognitive underpinnings effect VRN+NAC smoke behavior humans—thus , advance understand pathophysiology nicotine addiction .</detailed_description>
