	<brief_title>Ultrasound Evaluate Failure Liberation From Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transition unassisted breathe invasive ventilation often prove challenge , 40 % patient fail first attempt unassisted breathing . Persistent ventilator dependence predispose patient nosocomial complication increase economic burden critical illness . Ventilator-dependence result imbalance load capacity respiratory muscle pump . Patients fail trial spontaneous breathe commonly exhibit excess respiratory load secondary weaning-induced pulmonary edema , atelectasis dynamic hyperinflation . Many patient dependent ventilator also show striking loss pump capacity due diaphragm dysfunction . Though mechanisms respond specific intervention , often difficult physician discern mechanism play bedside . Bedside ultrasound potentially useful mean evaluate cardiac , pulmonary diaphragm function wean failure . It readily available , highly feasible already widely employ clinical practice . As yet , study evaluate accuracy feasibility combine echocardiography lung diaphragm ultrasound comprehensively evaluate physiological mechanism wean failure . The objective study establish utility rapid thoracic ultrasound exam diagnose mechanism ventilation liberation failure ass relationship cardiothoracic variability spontaneous breathe different physiological mechanism wean failure .</detailed_description>
