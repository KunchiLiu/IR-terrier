	<brief_title>Study Intratumoral REOLYSIN® Combination With Gemcitabine Cisplatin Neoadjuvant Therapy Muscle-invasive Transitional Cell Carcinoma Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reovirus Serotype 3 - Dearing Strain ( REOLYSIN® ) naturally occur , ubiquitous , non-enveloped human reovirus . Reovirus show replicate selectively Ras-transformed cell cause cell lysis . Activating mutation Ras mutation oncogene signal Ras pathway may occur many 80 % human tumor . The specificity reovirus Ras-transformed cell , couple relatively nonpathogenic nature human , make attractive anti-cancer therapy candidate . This open-label study intratumoral REOLYSIN® combination standard care neoadjuvant cisplatin/gemcitabine patient histologically clinically confirm muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( T2-4 ) without pelvic lymph node involvement ( N1-2 ) Stage III IV distant metastasis ( M0 ) prior systemic therapy bladder cancer . Treatment intratumoral REOLYSIN® chemotherapy plan 3 cycle follow radical cystectomy unacceptable toxicity another discontinuation criterion meet . Two sequential treatment cohort enrol . Patients Cohort 1 receive intratumoral REOLYSIN® Cycle 1 Day 1 , 7-14 day later patient receive intratumoral REOLYSIN® Cycle 2 Day 1 plus intravenous neoadjuvant chemotherapy 2 cycle ( every 3 week ) start Cycle 2 Day 2 follow radical cystectomy . Three patient enrol cohort . If Dose Limiting Toxicity cohort expand additional 3 patient . Upon completion Cohort 1 , Cohort 2 open enrollment 3 patient receive 3 cycle standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy Day 1 Day 8 cycle intratumoral REOLYSIN® Day 2 cycle ( every 3 week ) . If Dose Limiting Toxicity cohort expand additional 3 patient . An Expansion Cohort follow 12 patient enrol follow either Cohort 1 Cohort 2 treatment regimen base result Cohort 1 Cohort 2 .</detailed_description>
