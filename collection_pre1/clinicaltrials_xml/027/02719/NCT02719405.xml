	<brief_summary>Primary Endpoint -The percentage subject develop tolerance cow 's milk protein 12 month post randomization study formula . Secondary Endpoints - Tolerance - The transcriptional profile milk-specific T cell clinical outcome . - Growth Weight Velocity - Stool Consistency Frequency - The estimated frequency milk-specific T cell clinical outcome . - The TCR diversity milk-specific T cell clinical outcome . - The milk allergen component-specific IgE , IgG4 IgA clinical outcome . - Safety - The rate report adverse event treatment group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Infant Formula Resolution Cow 's Milk Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cow 's Milk Allergy ( CMA ) prevalent often present infancy . Disease manifestation vary range immediate delay inflammatory response milk protein anaphylaxis enterocolitis . The natural history also highly variable ; child achieve clinical tolerance early life , minority disease persist adulthood reason know . Most presentation mild manage restriction reduction immunologically intact milk protein reintroduction sometime year age ; however , data suggest level antigenic stimulation may beneficial . Furthermore , recent data suggest oral probiotic exposure may also promote tolerance , though kinetics tolerance acquisition , interaction two factor ( probiotic milk antigen exposure ) relationship regulatory T cell response poorly define . Therefore , unmet need identify dietary intervention , along correspond immune response , favor promotion tolerance . A major objective measure effect probiotic development tolerance milk antigen time . By follow infant first year life , repeatedly collect blood stool sample , poise analyze stool microbiome signature , estimate frequency , phenotype TCR diversity milk-specific T cell time . By repeatedly challenge immunologically intact milk protein , good define kinetics CMA resolution association variable . This information likely elucidate CMA disease mechanism identify possible biomarkers disease resolution versus persistence . It directly useful evaluate efficacy probiotic hydrolyze formula promote milk tolerance .</detailed_description>
