	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Visual Attention Following mTBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) one commonly sustain combat-related injury . Complaints poor attention often follow mTBI become chronic individual . Chronic attention complaint traditionally treat cognitive rehabilitation speech pathologist . Recent research show computerized program may add additional value either independently conjunction traditional therapy . Researchers UC Riverside already complete research show vision training , use ULTIMEYES program create , lead improve vision standard assessment , read eye-charts , real world skill , read play baseball . This program design broadly improve basic aspect vision , visual acuity contrast sensitivity , well high-level vision , attention . Furthermore , associate memory training task ( Recall The Game ) show improvement memory task transfer skill fluid intelligence . The objective proposal evaluate effectiveness rehabilitation visual attention deficit U.S. military service member across three program : 1 . Visual Attention Memory Program ( UCR Games ) 2 . Cognitive Psychological Based Rehabilitation ( Speech Pathologist-Directed Therapy ) 3 . General Cognitive Rehabilitation Games ( Lumosity [ 2 ] ) The investigator hope gain good understand unique cumulative influence different cognitive rehabilitation program improve attention complaint mTBI . This proposal contain retrospective prospective component . The retrospective component consist examine archival data Lumosity , previously collect part routine clinical care . The data contain pre- post-assessments post-concussive symptom , symptom frequency , cognitive testing . The investigator expect data analysis reveal evidence improvement severity post-concussive symptom , frequency troublesome cognitive problem , performance neuropsychological test pre- post-assessments compare . The prospective component consist 120 service member mTBI ongoing attention complaint three month post-injury . Each service member randomly assign one four arm , differentiate specific computer-based rehabilitation program use . All individual also treat per current standard care guideline speech pathologist . Each four arm comprise 30 participant . A cognitive testing battery administer participant implementation intervention . The cognitive testing battery form vary base time administration order control practice effect . Performance cognitive test battery self-report measure compare within three arm . This research help military identify best cognitive rehabilitation treatment program address ongoing attention complaint follow mTBI .</detailed_description>
