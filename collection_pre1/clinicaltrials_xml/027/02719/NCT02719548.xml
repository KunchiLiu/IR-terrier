	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , 2 phase/crossover , single center premarket feasibility study enrol total 15 subject . Follow visit 14 day . The study divide two phase . The objective phase 1 : - assessment Comfort ( subjective ) - occurrence type adverse event - ass different design ( shape soft edge ) three provide breast shield interact lactate breast pumping , regard : - The influence nipple size , diameter length ( measure pumping ) - Maximum comfortable vacuum select participant ( mmHg ) - Actual vacuum generate tunnel breast shield relation vacuum level indicator breast pump ( mmHg ) - Characteristics nipple movement tunnel pump - Amount tissue enter tunnel maximum applied vacuum ( mm ) - Amount tissue enter tunnel minimum applied vacuum ( mm ) - Space breast shield ( mm ) The objective phase 2 - ass participant perceive comfort soft-edge breast shield mid term use home - assess adverse event occur Study procedure - Phase 1 The participant invite pump session ( 3 time 2 minute expression ) Medela Headquarters . The CE-marked Freestyle breast pump pumpset use phase study.The participant ask pump 3 time 3 breast shield randomize order . Each pump session ( defined pump start till pump stop ) short ( 2 minute pump milk ejection occur ) , three short pump session do leave side . All pump session start stimulation mode change expression mode soon milk flow . Study procedures - Phase 2 Once debrief finish participant instruct Phase 2 ( home use ) part study equipment use . Study subject Freestyle system use , system provide . All subject provide applicable breast shield type introduce well new shield hand . - soft-edge breast shield ( non CE-marked ) - modify PersonalFit Breast Shield ( non CE-marked ) This part start participant day phase 1assessment Medela Headquarters . Day 1-7 ( Evaluation pump experience modify PersonalFit breast shield ) Day 7 ( Comfort evaluation modify PersonalFit breast shield ) Day 8-14 ( Evaluation pump experience soft-edge breast shield ) Day 14 ( Comfort evaluation soft-edge breast shield )</detailed_description>
