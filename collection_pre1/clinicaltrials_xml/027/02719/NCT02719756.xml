	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis early use combination therapy dapagliflozin metformin provide good glycemic control low glycemic variability without hypoglycemic episode , well tolerate up-titration metformin monotherapy . The study also correlate benefit glycated hemoglobin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes progressive , chronic metabolic disease characterize hyperglycemia . Despite therapeutic advance , incidence prevalence diabetes continue surge . Worldwide , number individual diabetes project rise 366 million 2011 552 million 2030 , equivalent approximately three new case diagnose every 10 second . Type 2 diabetes double risk cardiovascular disease , macrovascular complication ( myocardial infarction stroke ) common cause death patient type 2 diabetes . The U.K . Prospective Diabetes Study show every 1 % absolute decline mean A1C associate 37 % reduction risk microvascular complication 21 % reduction risk diabetes-related complication death . Diabetes also exact tremendous economic burden . Meeting treatment goal elusive many people diabetes . Data National Health Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 2006 show 57.1 % adult diagnose diabetes achieve A1C &lt; 7 % , 45.5 % blood pressure level &lt; 130/80 mmHg , 46.5 % LDL cholesterol level &lt; 100 mg/dl . Only 12.2 % people diabetes reach three goal . Treatment Type 2 diabetes limited glycaemic control . Rather , proper management hyperglycaemia , weight , blood pressure , lipids benefit term slow progression Type 2 diabetes , decrease risk CV disease , improve overall health.Current antihyperglycaemic treatment predominantly insulin-dependent . These treatment effectively manage HbA1c , treatment may influence patient 's comorbidities potential treatment-related adverse event . However , Type 2 diabetes progress , regimen need modify compensate decline beta-cell function decrease insulin sensitivity . On basis , EASD/ADA guideline suggest follow treatment pathway well validated therapy 's core.Of many comorbid condition describe , excess weight especially important , increased disease risk , also management blood pressure lipid . Consequently , AACE/ACE algorithms give priority regimens added benefit minimise hypoglycaemic event weight gain.In addition , antidiabetic treatment tend focus insulin-dependent mechanism organ liver pancreas , forgotten kidney also role maintain glucose homeostasis There multiple barrier achieve optimal glycemic control . Current medication type 2 diabetes potential adverse effect ; example , cause hypoglycemia weight gain . Hypoglycaemia limit factor glycaemic management patient advance Type 2 diabetes.Most often hypoglycaemia associate mild severe neurologic symptom , case result death . Additionally , risk cardiac ischaemia increase Type 2 diabetes patient symptomatic asymptomatic hypoglycaemia compare patient hyperglycaemia stable normoglycaemia . The risk hypoglycaemia increase advance age , polypharmacy , later stag disease , intensive antihyperglycaemic treatment certain drug , sulphonylureas . Intensive treatment ( target HbA1c &lt; 7.0 % ) result great number patient experience severe hypoglycaemic event ( 3-21 % ) compare conventional treatment ( target HbA1c â‰¥7.0 % ; 2-10 % ) , although intensive therapy may great beneficial effect term decrease risk microvascular disease . As result , hypoglycaemia one several factor , include weight gain increase CV disease-related overall mortality , may limit microvascular benefit intensive therapy . Thus , search continue novel therapeutic agent help patient avoid limit side effect provide glycemic control .</detailed_description>
