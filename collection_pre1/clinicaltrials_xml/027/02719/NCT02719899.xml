	<brief_summary>Background : Researchers want good understand body immune response calorie restriction . To , ask healthy volunteer fast 24 hour . Researchers test immune response fasting . Objectives : To explore benefit calorie restriction immune health . Eligibility : Healthy volunteer age 21 37 body mass index 22 29 . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . Participants visit NIH overnight fast . Their baseline immune response take . They give blood urine sample . Then give breakfast . This visit take 2 hour . Participants fast ( eat drink anything except water ) next 24 hour . They return NIH next morning . Their immune response take . They give blood urine sample . Then give breakfast . Their immune response take 3 hour later . They give blood sample . This visit take 4 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Fasting Refeeding T-cell Fate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent caloric restrict fast numerous health effect include reduction numerous cardiovascular pulmonary disease risk factor . The cellular program activate caloric restriction similarly regulate preclinical clinical study response 24-hour fast . We find beneficial effect 24-hour fasting blunts activation component innate immune system , term NLRP3 inflammasome . This inflammasome , mediator sterile inflammation , associate development diabetes , asthma atherosclerosis . At time , find refeeding 24-hour fast significantly increase NLRP3 protein level . As NLRP3 increase obesity , nutrient intervention ( 24 hour fast refeeding ) study may useful evaluate nutrient-overload effect immune system . Pertaining recently find preclinical study NLRP3 also orchestrate differentiation na ( SqrRoot ) T cell T ( H ) 2 cell . Interestingly NLRP3 inflammasome T ( H ) 2 cell activation contribute asthma . In context hypothesize assessment effect refeeding T ( H ) 2 cell differentiation ( polarity ) may allow u dissect mechanism underpin nutrient overload induce T ( H ) 2 cell activation . To evaluate blood sample test T-cell biology collect subject , baseline , fix caloric meal response 24-hour fast ( water intake restrict ) . The objective pilot study identify nutrient-load regulates T-Cell differentiation capacity test whether pathway could investigate therapeutic target blunt/negate inflammation associate nutrient-excess associated disease include asthma .</detailed_description>
