	<brief_summary>Intracranial atherosclerotic disease ( ICAD ) important cause ischemic stroke . The occurrence stroke cause symptomatic ICAD significantly different compare asymptomatic ICAD ( 19 % vs 3.5 % ) , suggest plaque vulnerability may responsible difference . Based previous high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging ( HR-MRI ) result , investigator hypothesis feature intracranial plaque enhancement important imaging biomarker plaque instability , closely related stroke . The investigator establish ICAD cohort use HR-MRI investigate composition , morphology enhancement pattern symptomatic ICAD plaque . These finding correlate biochemical marker , stroke recurrence , order explore : 1. plaque characteristic enhancement feature symptomatic ICAD asymptomatic ICAD 2. relationship plaque enhancement composition plaque ; 3. relationship among enhancement feature symptomatic ICAD plaque , biomarkers different clinical significance , 4. evolution enhancement feature symptomatic ICAD plaque intensive medical therapy . The investigator aim explore correlation vulnerable plaque stratification clinical outcome , explore value vascular response pathogenicity ICAD vulnerable plaque , well provide objective basis establishment evaluation criterion intracranial atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Detailed description : Title : Vessel wall Perfusion Imaging Intracranial Atherosclerosis Design : This prospective study study characteristic intracranial atherosclerotic plaque enhancement feature symptomatic ICAD mean follow-up 1 year symptomatic asymtomatic patient moderate severe stenosis middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) . In WASID trail , patient least 70 % stenosis major intracranial artery increase risk recurrent stroke . However , The degree stenosis longer single predictor vulnerable atherosclerotic lesion . Vulnerable plaque closely associate stroke recurrence.With development neurologic imaging , HR-MRI unique ability provide information plaque composition , plaque burden vulnerable feature . Several recent investigation suggest enhancement intracranial plaque associate recurrent stroke . However , corhort study perform . This prospective , multicenter trail conduct China . Based previous work , participant divide two group : symtomatic ICAD asymtomatic ICAD . Neurological examination clinical serum test perform baseline , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 months.The stroke incidence rate asymptomatic ICAD stroke recurrence rate symptomatic ICAD record .</detailed_description>
