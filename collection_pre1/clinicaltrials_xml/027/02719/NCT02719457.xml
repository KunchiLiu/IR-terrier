	<brief_title>Spot Marching Exercise Test Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) cause airway inflammation ( increase airway resistance ) destroy alveolus ( decrease elastic recoil ) lead air trap ( GOLD , 2013 ) . Dyspnea symptom COPD , consequence air trap . Furthermore , inflammation COPD assess airway lung compartment , also systemic circulation call `` systemic effect COPD '' skeletal muscle atrophy dysfunction cardiovascular disease ( Wouter , 2002 ) . The occurrence dyspnea systemic effect COPD result activity exercise limitation disease progressive downward . Exercise test common determination exercise limitation responsiveness intervention COPD . It several exercise protocol include laboratory test field test . Both test aim investigate exercise capacity laboratory test parameter detail field test . In 2013 Borel et al , classify exercise protocol three category use workload characteristic ( incremental constant ) self-paced test . Self-paced test develop solve disadvantage Incremental Constant work rate ( laboratory test ) . Moreover , reflect functional activity easy use . Self-paced test famous test six minute walk test , step test stepper test Six minute walk test ( 6-MWT ) assess distance walk far possible within 6 minute straight course . Although 6-MWT reliable , impractical ( Kocks et al. , 2011 ) environmental constrain ( test perform wild area ) . Step test perform small area hospital physician 's office . However , protocol risk fall . Therefore , unsuitable patient imbalance articular problem . In 2010 , Borel et al. , develop six-minute stepper test ( 6-MST ) solve problem 6MWT step test . This study report 6-MST used oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) low 6MWT . They reason stepper test , subject move upper limb few walk test . Similarly Mayo et al. , 2001 , find heart rate expiratory minute ventilation ( VE ) response arm performance high leg . Therefore , movement upper limb may increase VO2 peak exercise test COPD patient . Exercise limitation COPD patient occur low body activity also occur upper task due systemic effect disease . Upper body activity use daily activity lifting , bath wash . The almost protocols exercise test focus low limb test . The investigator need find exercise test performance upper low part movement easy apply small setting . In 2013 , Premsri et al . study march exercise sympathetic activation sedentary Thais . And 2013 , Promsrisuk et al . study effect brisk march anthropometry , functional exercise capacity physical performance among elderly woman . Marching exercise repetitive pattern arm leg alternate movement bend hip 45-90 degree knee flexion ( Premsri et al.,2013 ) also lift shoulder flexion 90 degree . Therefore , The investigator interested pattern march exercise use upper low extremity use exercise test COPD patient . The investigator expect march increase performance maximum level nearby 6-MWT COPD major disease Thailand affect quality life patient also burden family society large term cost health care loss economic activity . Improvements diagnosis care treatment help minimize problem first stage diagnosis assessment . Despite fact many different exercise protocol use purpose still need test easy use , especially community , one involve arm legs representative activity daily life . This project concern develop test . Therefore , study ass relationship compare physiological response spot march exercise test 6 minute walk test patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</detailed_description>
