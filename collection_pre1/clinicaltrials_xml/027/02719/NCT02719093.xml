	<brief_title>Role FSHR Polymorphism p.N680S Therapy With FSH Patients Who Underwent Varicocele Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two common SNPs ( c.919 A &gt; G , pT307A , r 6165 c.2039 A &gt; G , p.N680S , rs6166 ) locate linkage disequilibrium exon 10 FSHR . The 2039 A &gt; G variant regularly analyze characterize exon 10 haplotype . It well know follice-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) receptor ( FSHR ) polymorphism p.N680S mediates different response FSH vitro , polymorphism associate ovarian response control ovarian hyperstimulation . In last year , FSHR gene polymorphism study potential risk factor spermatogenetic failure . It show influence FSHR 2039 A &gt; G FSH level testicular volume . Trends high FSH low testicular volume observe G-allele carrier ( Ala307/Ser680 ) . Men homozygous Thr307/Asn680 low mean serum FSH concentration compare men genotype . In addition , sperm concentration total sperm count high testis volume large . Another clinical study show patient heterozygous Thr/Ala + Asn/Ser combine genotype 2.65 time susceptible infertility control group . It also show high sensitivity receptor FSHR 2039 A &gt; G AA homozygotes1-2 . A recent Cochrane review show beneficial effect live birth pregnancy gonadotrophin treatment men idiopathic male factor subfertility . These study suggest analysis gene represent valid pharmacogenetic approach treatment male infertility , confirm also importance strict criterion selection patient treat FSH . Which FSHR polymorphism benefit FSH treatment clinically important , particular regard nonidiopathic patient . It also relevant pharmacoeconomic point view . In many andrological unit , patient underwent adiuvant therapy purify recombinant FSH varicocelectomy . FSH treatment patient varicocelectomy could improve spermatogenesis , n't multicentric trial confirm validity . Usually , hospital patient morphologic aspect hypospermatogenesis underwent therapy purify recombinant FSH , therapy much useful patient Partial Sertoli-cell-only syndrome maturation arrest . The purpose study correlate `` non responder '' patient underwent FSH adiuvant therapy varicocele surgery p.N680S FSHR polymorphism . Moreover investigator suppose `` non responder '' patient beneficiate high-dose therapy FSH . This prospective intervention study recruit male OligoAstenoTeratozoospermic ( OAT ) varicocele . The partecipants undergo subinguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy ( Marmar technique ) needle aspiration testicular cytology ( Foresta technique ) . One-hundred patient morphologic aspect hypospermatogenesis testicular cytology take recombinant follitropin alfa 150UI i.m . 3 times/week least three month . At 3th month partecipants semen analysis , without interrupt treatment , FSHR gene polymorphism p.N680S characterization PCR high resolution melt HRM DNA extract simple blood sample . Patients significative increase least two parameter semen , consider `` responder '' patient semen parameter improve worsen consider `` non responder '' . `` Responders '' patient interrupt therapy new semen analysis six month verify maintenance semen parameter three month therapy . `` Non responder '' patient take daily dose rFSH 150 UI additional three month , investigator suppose men specific polymorphisms n't response therapy need high dose stimulate spermatogenesis spontaneous pregnancy . At 6th month also patient new semen analyse order verify improvement spermatogenesis .</detailed_description>
