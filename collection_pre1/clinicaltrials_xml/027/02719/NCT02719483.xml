	<brief_title>Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy Spastic Plantar Flexor Muscles Young Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) clinical syndrome characterize persistent disorder posture movement cause non-progressive disorder immature brain . The prevalence CP report 1.86 case per 1,000 population United Kingdom 3.6 case per 1,000 8-year-old child United States , little variation among Western nation . In recent systematic review analyze total 49 study , pool overall prevalence CP 2.11 case per 1,000 live birth . Rates CP population-based setting India China give figure 2-2.8 case per 1,000 birth . A systematic literature review period span 1965 2004 find CP prevalent deprive socio-economic population . The study identify low birthweight , intrauterine infection multiple gestation important risk factor CP . Most child CP suffer spasticity main motor disorder . Spasticity major challenge rehabilitation child CP . This spasticity cause pain , prevent hamper function may disturb sleep . Spasticity plantar flexor muscle particular problem CP cause toe walk . This result major functional implication disturbance balance walking , interfere gross motor function . The management spasticity CP complex major challenge treatment team . The ultimate goal therapy program must achieve child 's maximum potential motor skill . Unfortunately , scientific evidence various physical therapy treatment option child CP limit . Botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) widely use effective pharmacological treatment focal muscle over-activity . An alternative BoNT treatment focal intramuscular treatment phenol alcohol , aim improve activity limitation outcomes child adult spasticity . However , focal intramuscular injection BoNT , phenol alcohol without problem : ( ) BoNT expensive available many country ; ( ii ) significant risk focal intramuscular injection alcohol phenol persist pain ; ( iii ) procedures invasive , thus , without risk apply difficult hygienic condition . With regard post-stroke spasticity , recent Cochrane review conclude , best , 'low level ' evidence effectiveness outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation improve active function impairment follow BoNT treatment upper limb spasticity adult chronic stroke . Orthopedic surgery consider last resort manage spasticity child CP , option manage spasticity per se . Instead , use help correct secondary problem occur growth alongside spastic muscle poor motion control . Those problem include muscle shortening , joint contracture bony deformity . Recently , extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) become alternative treatment spasticity . A byproduct extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy , ESWT emerge noninvasive management option tendon pathology musculoskeletal system minimal unwanted side effect temporary skin redness pain treatment . Prior study tendinopathy show ESWT effective form treatment eccentric exercise , traditional physiotherapy , steroid injection surgery . There two different type extracorporeal shock wave - focus ( fESWT ) radial ( rESWT ) - several mode operation focus radial extracorporeal shock wave generator . Among study fESWT rESWT spasticity perform far , six 18 ( 33 % ) pilot study without control group , seven ( 39 % ) pseudo-controlled study ( i.e. , patient serve her/his control , one placebo treatment follow one ESWT treatment one two week later ) , five ( 28 % ) randomize control trial ( RCTs ) . It note none study fESWT rESWT spasticity perform patient young average 4.8 year age . However , argue management spasticity child CP start early possible , evidence early intervention ( i.e. , age 36 month ) minimize secondary complication CP . Acknowledging ( ) particular problem spastic plantar flexor muscle CP , ( ii ) limit scientific evidence various physical therapy treatment option child CP , ( iii ) risk limitation associate BoNT focal intramuscular treatment phenol alcohol , ( iv ) proven effectiveness rESWT treatment spasticity patient CP age 10 46 year age , aim present study determine whether rESWT combination traditional conservative therapy safe effective management spastic plantar flexor muscle patient CP young average three year age .</detailed_description>
