	<detailed_description>EBUS-TBNA : If agree take part study , part standard-of-care , EBUS-TBNA SBRT . You perform out-patient procedure general anesthetic . You receive separate consent explain procedure risk . The sample collect EBUS-TBNA test compare result standard PET/CT scan . Follow-Up : As part standard-of-care , SBRT physical exam chest CT scan check status disease every 3 month first 2 year , twice year follow year . After 3 year , visit 1 time year . Your medical information follow-up visit collect study . All information study store password-protected system . Length Study Participation : Your active participation study tissue sample collect EBUS-TBNA . Your medical information continue collect long come follow-up visit . This investigational study . The EBUS-TBNA perform use FDA-approved commercially available method . It investigational compare result EBUS-TBNA PET/CT scan learn accuracy way find evidence early stage lung cancer . Up 150 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
