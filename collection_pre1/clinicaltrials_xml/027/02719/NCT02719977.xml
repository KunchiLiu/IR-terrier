	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study CX5461</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose first phase study ( phase I ) find dose new therapy , CX5461 , tolerate without cause severe side effect see effect study drug cancer . Participants give CX5461 watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If serious side effect see patient first dose level , dose CX5461 may lower subsequent patient . If side effect serious , participant ask join study give high dos . This continue dose find cause severe temporary side effect . Doses high give . The purpose second phase study ( phase II ) find effect new drug , CX5461 , breast cancer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Tumour Type Phase I : Patients must histologically/and cytologically confirm solid malignancy advanced/metastatic/recurrent unresectable curative therapy exists . Phase II : Patients must metastatic/recurrent/locally advanced/unresectable triple negative breast cancer must BRCA1/2 HRD germline somatic aberration ( know , document screening ) . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) available must provide informed consent release block . All patient phase II must also provide informed consent whole blood sample . At least 6 patient cohort Phase II ( HRD know prior enrollment detect preenrollment screening ) must also provide informed consent willing undergo tumour skin biopsy prior treatment ( registration ) cycle 2 day 8 . Note : During accrual portion study , may necessary restrict accrual patient suitable , consent , tumour skin biopsy . Patients must ≥ 18 year age . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior registration ( within 35 day negative ) . Phase I : patient need measurable disease Phase II : patient must measurable disease Previous Therapy Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : Phase I : There limit number prior regimen receive . Phase II : Patients must receive least one 3 regimen advanced disease ( Note : adjuvant anthracycline/taxane contain chemotherapy consider advanced regimen ) Note : initially , limitation use prior platinum contain regimen . After interim analysis phase II , accrual may limited patient consider platinum naive , platinum sensitive ( evidence disease progression within 3 month last dose . Sites inform time open cohort ) . Other Systemic Therapy : Phase I : There limit number prior therapy , include PARP inhibitor . Phase II : Previous treatment PARP inhibitor allow . There limit prior therapy receive . Patients must recover ( baseline ≤ grade 1 ) reversible toxicity relate prior chemotherapy systemic therapy adequate washout follow : Longest one follow : Two week , 5 halflives investigational agent , Standard cycle length standard therapy . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse last dose radiation date registration . Exceptions may make lowdose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation CCTG . Concurrent radiotherapy permit . Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse major surgery date registration , wound heal occur . Lab Requirements Absolute neutrophil : ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets : ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin : ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) AST/ALT : ≤ 2.5 x ULN ≤ 5.0 x ULN patient liver metastasis Serum creatinine : ≤ 1.25 x ULN Creatinine clearance : ≥ 50 mL/min Women/men childbearing potential must agree use two effective contraceptive method study 6 month last dose CX5461 . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Treatment begin within 2 work day patient registration . Other Malignancies Phase I Patients malignancy require concurrent anticancer therapy . Phase II Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer , solid tumour curatively treat least 2 year prior registration evidence disease require concurrent anticancer treatment . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis spinal cord compression . Patients asymptomatic brain/spinal cord metastasis plan radiation , treat stable steroid ( decrease dose ) anticonvulsant eligible . History hypersensitivity CX5461 excipient . Patients know photosensitivity disorder ( xeroderma pigmentosa , porphyria etc ) .
