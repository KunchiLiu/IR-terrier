	<detailed_description>While agreement woman risk abnormality fetal growth serial ultrasound examination 3rd trimester , lack consensus frequently exams do . The American College Obstetrics Gynecology recommend ultrasound ass fetal growth perform 2 4 week ; however , prospective randomize trial determine whether optimal interval closer 2 week delay 4 week . Currently , 60 % fetus ' abnormal growth detect antenatally . There equipoise whether ultrasound every 2 versus 4 week improve detection subsequent newborn outcome merely lead increase false positive unnecessary intervention . It propose , delivery occurs within 2 week ultrasound , antenatal detection abnormal growth may accurate hence likely improve outcome . Conversely , short interval may result confusion whether actual change growth merely variation measurement technique . Moreover , cost ultrasound average approximately $ 200 per examination , interval ultrasound major implication public-health cost well intervention subsequently follow abnormality detect . The purpose randomize control trial compare frequency diagnosis fetal growth abnormality ultrasound assessment perform 2 versus 4 week interval .</detailed_description>
