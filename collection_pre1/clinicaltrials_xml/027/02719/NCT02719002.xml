	<brief_summary>Maculopathy induce retinal toxicity synthetic antimalarial screen sub-clinical stage . Indeed , first visual symptom appear , macular damage already irreversible clinical picture may even continue deteriorate several year end synthetic antimalarial use . In opposition , early termination hydroxychloroquine patient show recent alteration multifocal electroretinogram ( nfERG ) allow reversibility toxic damage six month period . It therefore critical detect early retinal anatomic change retinotoxicity screen occurrence irreversible anatomical functional consequence . The usual patient monitoring consist annual eye examination , detect subjective functional abnormality ( visual acuity , color vision , central visual field test ) macular lesion ( eye fundus ) . These abnormality show constituted infringement contribute early diagnosis synthetic antimalarial maculopathy . The mfERG objective examination , able detect retinal damage whilst still reversible . It recommend annual monitoring , today , gold standard screen diagnosis synthetic antimalarial maculopathy . However , realization time consuming , require good patient cooperation difficult access due ophthalmology center offer . In practice , rarely do systematic annual screening patient long-term synthetic antimalarial treatment . It often limit second-line study ( patient already show functional anatomical abnormality ) whereas interest lie detection early lesion . The Optical Coherence Tomography Spectral Domain ( OCT-SD ) non-invasive eye examination , commonly use since nearly 10 year . A special image analysis provide panoramic view state photoreceptor layer , non-invasive detection anatomical change , even subtle , within layer . The concordance `` en face '' OCT mfERG screen synthetic antimalarial maculopathy consider study .</brief_summary>
