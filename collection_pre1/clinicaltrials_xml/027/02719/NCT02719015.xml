	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerate dose rAd.CD40L ( also call ISF35 ) give pembrolizumab patient melanoma . Researchers also want learn high tolerate dose ISF35 pembrolizumab help control disease . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Cohort Expansion Safety Tolerability Study Intratumoral rAd.CD40L ( ISF35 ) Combination Systemic Pembrolizumab Patients With Refractory Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 dose level ISF35 base join study . Up 6 participant enrol first group 24 participant enrolled second group . The first group participant receive low dose level . If intolerable side effect see , participant enrol study receive high dose . If participant assign first group , able move second group . All participant also receive dose pembrolizumab . Study Drug Administration : Participants receive ISF35 injection directly 1-3 tumor every 3 week . The injection do clinic interventional radiology suite . The study staff may use image guidance ultrasound , CT , and/or MRI help inject drug tumor . Participants also receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute every 3 week . Study Visits : At Week 0 ( first week participant receive treatment ) : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's immune system . - Participant tumor biopsy check disease respond study drug . To collect biopsy , area skin numb anesthetic small cut make remove part affected tissue . This biopsy perform within 24 hour first dose . - The tumor photograph measure . For photograph , participant 's private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless tumor face . At Weeks 1 2 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . At Weeks 3 , 6 , 9 ( ± 3 day ) : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's immune system . - During Week 6 , participant biopsy 1 tumor inject study drug 1 tumor injection learn tumor respond study drug . Researchers also want learn participant genetic mutation ( change ) may change respond study drug . The tumor also photograph measure . Length Study : Participant may receive study drug 9 week . Participant take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study 2 year follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : About 3 week participant 's last dose study drug ( Week 12 ) soon stop take study drug ( stop take study drug Week 9 ) : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test , check participant 's immune system , learn study drug effect disease . - Participant MRI , CT , positron emission compute tomography ( PET ) /CT scan tumor photograph measure . Follow-Up Within 2 week participant 's last dose study drug every 8-12 week 2 year : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test , check participant 's immune system , learn study drug effect disease . - Participant MRI , CT , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . The tumor also measure photograph . Participant 's doctor decide type scan . - At participant 's first follow-up visit stop take study drug , tumor biopsy check status disease . If participant chooses receive care another hospital , study staff call every 3 month 2 year last dose study drug learn . The call last 5 minute . This investigational study . ISF35 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 36 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
