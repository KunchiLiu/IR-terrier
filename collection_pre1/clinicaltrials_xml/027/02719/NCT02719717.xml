	<brief_summary>This research program consist prospective , multi-institutional Phase 2 trial economic cost-effectiveness analysis use ACE+7 VATS lobectomy/segmentectomy compare traditional technique . It leave study credentialed surgeon investigator decide suitability PA branch seal . This decide intra-operatively base anatomy , vascular dissection length well patient specific factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasonic Energy Pulmonary Artery Branch Sealing During VATS Lobectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , minority anatomic pulmonary resection perform VATS ( 15 % ) . The technical difficulty increase actual perceived danger VATS lobectomy relate PA branch manipulation , staple division . This main limitation many thoracic surgeon regard adoption VATS lobectomy practice . Furthermore , majority VATS lobectomies perform high volume , academic medical center resultant disparity socioeconomic status undergo VATS versus open lobectomy . If find way decrease manipulation require surgeon PA branch , procedure safer , less stressful surgeon therefore prevalent anatomical pulmonary resection . Energy utilization VATS lobectomy may also cost effective endostaplers . The use single device lymph node dissection , hilar dissection , PA branch sealing may allow overall procedural cost saving . There may also potential benefit decrease overall length hospital stay due decrease chest tube duration secondary decrease post-operative pleural fluid output follow VATS lobectomy use energy oppose cautery mediastinal lymph node dissection . Objectives : - Systematically evaluate immediate , short- medium-term efficacy safety PA seal utilise ACE+7 human VATS Lobectomy/Segmentectomy . - Understand cost issue relate use ACE+7 human VATS Lobectomy/Segmentectomy . General satisfaction surgeon utilize energy seal device compare standard endostaplers assess use post-procedural online survey administer research team immediately follow procedure . This multi-institutional , international trial important decrease bias associate single center study bolster confidence level thoracic surgeon result trial . Study sit specifically choose USA , Canada Europe order increase worldwide generalizability result .</detailed_description>
