	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal disorder common non-motor symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . They affect entire intestinal tract include excess saliva stasis ( 70 % patient ) , dysphagia ( 52 % ) , gastroparesis ( 34-45 % ) , constipation . Gastroparesis participate dyspepsia abdominal pain . Constipation , define international standard criterion Rome III , present 59 % PD patient lead functional impairment 70 % patient . The mechanism underlie constipation multifactorial may include slow transit defecation disorder secondary anorectal dysfunction . Bowel disorder present early stage disease usually precede onset motor symptom . They may result lesion enteric nervous system , autonomic nervous system , probable alteration gastrointestinal motility control central nervous system . The STW5 ( Iberogast , Steigerwald , Germany ) herbal agent compose nine plant extract , prokinetic , antispasmodic , prosecretory , anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant property . These property demonstrate animal human pathology , treatment dyspepsia irritable bowel syndrome . It phytotherapeutic agent efficacy demonstrate randomized double-blind trial indication . In PD , STW5 could improve constipation due prokinetic effect prosecretory enteric neuron . It could also improve dyspepsia abdominal pain antispasmodic property . We propose study efficacy safety STW5 bowel dysfunction parkinsonian patient , especially constipation .</detailed_description>
