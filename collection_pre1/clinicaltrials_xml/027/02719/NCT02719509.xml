	<detailed_description>Bedside cardiac ultrasound perform regularly emergency department ass patient present undifferentiated chest pain shortness breath . Utility cardiac ultrasound set emerge standard care . Cardiac ultrasound rapidly provide essential information presence absence multiple cardiopulmonary pathology . Cardiac ultrasound safe , immediately accessible , give provider data regard patient real-time . While cardiac ultrasound common practice emergency department , diagnostic utility test difficult study . There study literature describe utility evaluate specific diagnosis . These study evaluate use cardiac ultrasound diagnose acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema , aortic dilation/aneurysm , acute coronary syndrome , acute heart failure . The purpose study evaluate utility cardiac ultrasound patient present emergency department undifferentiated chest pain shortness breath . This study evaluate several parameter include cardiac ultrasound contribute provider 's management plan assessment patient 's diagnosis . This prospective observational study design . The investigator prospectively enroll eligible consecutive patient present emergency department undifferentiated chest pain shortness breath . Patients include provider order ( plan order ) cardiac ultrasound part patient 's diagnostic workup . Research associate screen two chief complaint approach ED provider ask order plan order cardiac ultrasound . ED provider may also contact research associate enroll patient meet study criterion . Pre-ultrasound assessment : After eligibility determine , research associate approach provider directly involve patient 's care ( Resident Staff ) . The provider complete data collection form need provider order perform ultrasound . The provider complete form Emergency Medicine 2nd year level resident . The provider fill data collection form fill pre-ultrasound assessment prior review cardiac ultrasound image ( either real-time computer ultrasound complete ) . The provider fill data collection form ask likely diagnosis , expect ultrasound finding , current management plan . After ultrasound complete provider ask likely diagnosis , observe ultrasound finding , new management change . Other clinical data collect include demographic data , vital sign , relevant co-morbidities , image result , lab result emergency department visit .</detailed_description>
