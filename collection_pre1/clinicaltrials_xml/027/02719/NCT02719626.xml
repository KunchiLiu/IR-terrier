	<brief_summary>Rutgers University partner Meals Wheels America ( MOWA ) affiliate agency five state conduct study design improve food safety nutrition emergency preparedness among homebound elderly recipient home deliver meal ( HDM ) . This population increase risk food borne disease , result unique physiological behavioral factor , particularly vulnerable disruption food system lack mobility . A multi-method research approach use target sample 1,000 MOWA homebound elderly client . Methods include use novel UPC scan technology quickly comprehensively catalogue food client ' home , home food safety audit , face-to-face interview . The goal study provide improve understanding unique food safety threat at-risk population , suggest easy , cost-effective way reduce know food safety risk factor , provide clear guideline amount type food need population emergency situation . Dissemination research finding recommendation do partnership EDEN MOWA , national constituency poise act recommendation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving The Safety And Nutritional Adequacy Of The Home Food Supply Of Elderly Recipients Of Home Delivered Meals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly homebound recipients home deliver meal ( HDM ) increase risk foodborne disease particularly vulnerable disruption might prevent delivery safe consumption food . In addition , great deal variability cognitive physical ability within population , well range access financial resource social support may vary individually geographically . Moreover , agency serve population depend heavily time donation volunteer carry important work . Therefore , ensure implementation , intervention design address food safety issue within population must relatively simple , efficient , cost effective . To address issue , multi-method research approach use , incorporate Universal Product Code ( UPC ) scan technology combine dynamically grow database food associate nutritional parameter catalogue in-home food supply , extant home food safety audit form , modify study use , computer-enhanced questionnaire administer in-home interview . This project provide useful understanding nutritional food safety gap at-risk population allow design test intervention improve food safety HDM in-home food available homebound elderly . It also provide clear useful guideline amount type food need population emergency situation . Dissemination result research finding recommendation accomplish partnership Extension Disaster Education Network ( EDEN ) MOWA , national constituency poise act recommendation . HDM agency 5 state ( AR , CA , IA , NJ , SC ) purposively select varied characteristic HDM client , identify analysis HDM recipient state . The purposive sample state include least one four quintiles MOWA Senior Hunger state ranking , two state top quintile . The chosen state also represent range term percentage minority client , high minority population one extremely low . Finally , percentage rural client range zero one state almost 70 % another . Each five agency ask complete study protocol 200 eligible HDM recipient draw client roll use random number generate study investigator . Sampling replacement carry quota 200 participant reach , additional eligible client recruit within agency . A targeted sample size 200 participant agency select provide overall target sample 1000 HDM recipient yield overall sampling error rate ± 3.1 % , base population approximately 900,000 HDM recipient . The study : 1 . Will analyze food safety quality parameter home food environment homebound elderly recipient HDM , identify specific barrier safe food-handling storage practice member high risk population . Refrigerator/freezer temperatures take adjustment make needed ensure refrigerate food store 40 °F frozen food 0 °F . 2 . Will estimate nutrient density adequacy home food supply homebound elderly recipient HDM , identify area nutrition population deficient would benefit specific supplemental nutrition , especially emergency . 3 . Two intervention propose improve food safety homebound elderly recipient HDM : implementation date label meal help prevent consumption potentially unsafe old food ; check refrigerator/freezer temperature determine temperature adherence/ maintenance , adjustment make need . 4 . Will partner nutritionist , emergency preparedness expert , MOWA , Extension Disaster Education Network ( EDEN ) develop disseminate food safety emergency preparedness recommendation specifically tailor need homebound elderly . Materials develop emergency food provider , home delivery meal provider elderly . Rutgers partner Meals Wheels America ( MOWA ) select MOWA affiliate agency five state conduct in-depth study vulnerable population design improve nutrition safety food consume homebound elderly recipient HDM , strengthen nation 's food defense system identify address critical nutrition need population , particularly times emergency .</detailed_description>
