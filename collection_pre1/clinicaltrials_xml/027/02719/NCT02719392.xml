	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Investigating Efficacy Minocycline N-Acetyl Cysteine Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator research study find minocycline alone , N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) alone , combination minocycline NAC help people bipolar depression add lithium . The investigator also want find minocycline , NAC , combination minocycline NAC safe take without cause many side effect . While U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve minocycline treat infection acne approve NAC mucolytic , FDA approve minocycline , n-acetylcysteine , combination minocycline n-acetylcysteine treat bipolar depression . This research study compare minocycline , n-acetylcysteine , combination n-acetylcysteine minocycline placebo . The placebo look exactly like study drug , contain neither minocycline NAC . During study participant may get placebo instead minocycline , n-acetylcysteine , combination minocycline n-acetylcysteine . Placebos use research study see result due study drug due reason .</detailed_description>
