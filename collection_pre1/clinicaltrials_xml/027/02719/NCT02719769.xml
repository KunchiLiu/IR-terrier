	<detailed_description>The clinical study entitle `` Evaluation Clinical Performance Accelerate ID/AST System Positive Blood Culture Identification &amp; Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing '' design demonstrate clinical performance Accelerate ID/AST System positive blood culture identification ( ID ) antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( AST ) clinical setting compare reference result . Approximately 3,000 positive blood culture sample ( across Clinical Sites ) test investigational device reference method . Up 50 % sample enrol comprise seed blood culture prepare clinical stock isolates . Quality Control test perform day test . The study population comprise left-over clinical specimen indicate positive blood culture monitor system utilized clinical microbiology laboratory . Positive blood culture sample must test Accelerate ID/AST System within 8 hour positivity blood culture monitoring system . Testing clinical sample continue require sample size target organism antimicrobial agent , include sufficient on-scale resistant strain , test across site .</detailed_description>
