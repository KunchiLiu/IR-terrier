	<brief_summary>Background : Genes basic unit heredity . When gene change , certain cell work like . Researchers want try good understand genetic condition link inherited eye disease . Objective : To try identify gene link development inherit eye disease . Eligibility : People age 4 old family member inherit eye disease Design : Participants screen medical history medical record . Participants one visit take 3 4 hour . This include : Medical family history Eye exam : This include pupil dilate . Electroretinography : A small electrode tap forehead . Participants sit dark eye patch 30 minute . Then numb drop contact lenses put eye . They watch flash light . Blood test Saliva sample : They spit container inside cheek swabbed . Genetic test do participant blood saliva . Participants may meet researcher discuss genetic test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This project , Clinical Molecular Studies Families Inherited Eye Disease study inherit eye disease , Mendelian complex age relate inherited eye disease , family many nationality ethnic background order identify gene , mutate , cause inherit eye disease pathophysiology act . Among disease study cataract , corneal dystrophy corneal disease , retinal degeneration , myopia anterior chamber defect , glaucoma . Study Population : Families individual many nationality ethnic background . We study maximum 5,000 patient family member . Design : The study consist ascertain individual especially family multiple individual , affect congenital age relate inherited eye disease . These patient family undergo detailed ophthalmological examination characterize visual system determine affectation status . A blood sample collect individual isolation DNA individual lymphoblastoid transformation establish renewable source DNA . Linkage analysis , association analysis , physical mapping , mutational screening carry identify specific gene mutation associate inherited eye disease family . Mutation screening may involve Sanger sequence small number candidate gene identify , whole genome whole exome sequence gene remain viable candidate initial analysis . If necessary , gene product characterize biochemically . The study enroll participant NEI collaborate institution . Outcome Measures : Linkage determine use lod score method , association determine use standard statistical procedure estimate p value , mutation specific gene assess use combination residue conservation , blosum score , bioinformatic prediction structural damage protein , molecular modeling . Assessment biochemical , metabolic , physiological effect mutation individualize specific case .</detailed_description>
