	<brief_summary>Alcohol use disorder present across medical specialty , alcohol-related death particularly prevalent category injury , liver cirrhosis , cancer , cardiovascular disease , disorder peripheral nerve central nervous system . Alcohol dependence , also refer alcohol use disorder , chronic , relapse disorder mark compulsive alcohol use , inability stop drinking despite harmful consequence , emergence withdrawal syndrome upon cessation use . Early abstinence associate activation brain stress system extend amygdala . Clinically , protract abstinence involves symptom crave , mood sleep disturbance , identify risk factor relapse . Nonetheless , implementation alcohol-specific medication remain limited across medical specialty . Medications treat alcohol dependence primarily adjunctive intervention , three medications—disulfiram , naltrexone , acamprosate—are approve indication United States Food Drug Administration . Baclofen , inhibitor synaptic transmission spinal reflex arc via hyper polarization primary afferent fiber terminal , originally approve Food Drug Administration 1977 use spasticity associate neurologic condition , multiple sclerosis spinal cord lesion . However , due pharmacologic property also investigate treatment alcohol dependence . But clinical practice study physician , observe patient prescribed baclofen alcohol dependence hit back alcohol soon despite drug . Therefore need search alternative drug could beneficial population patient . Gabapentin Food Drug Administration-approved management epileptic seizure neuropathic pain . It believe act block specific alpha-2d subunit voltage-gated calcium channel selective presynaptic site , result , indirectly modulate Gamma Butyric Acid neurotransmission . Pre-clinical finding indicate gabapentin normalizes stress-induced Gamma Butyric Acid activation amygdala associate alcohol dependence , provide excellent pre-clinical rationale evaluate gabapentin treatment alcohol dependence . Earlier study gabapentin alcohol dependent subject , attempt abstain follow withdrawal support safety potential efficacy gabapentin alcohol dependent patient , definitive conclusion limit either small sample size , methodological , dose issue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct patient alcohol dependence admit come patient department . The enrolled subject divide two group randomly use computer generate randomization system .

By take rate sustain abstinence 4.1 % placebo 17 % 1800 mg arm odd 's ratio 4.8 , sample size need 88 patient arm . 80 % power alpha level 0.05 . Investigators use uncorrected chi-squared statistic evaluate null hypothesis . Study Methods Enrollment patient , assess eligibility obtain informed consent carry one study investigator . Breath Test analyzer use detect blood alcohol content breath sample . Study Intervention The patient randomize either Arm A , Total subject 100 ( Alcoholic liver disease : Alcoholics liver disease= 1:1 ) receive Gabapentin 2000mg/day divide two dos 24 week . All patient receive standard care treatment . Arm B , Total subject 100 ( Alcoholic liver disease : Alcoholics liver disease= 1:1 ) ) receive Placebo 2000mg/day divide two dos 24 week . All patient receive standard care treatment . Concurrent study medication , study clinician provide participant 20 minute weekly manual-guided counseling design increase motivation , abstinence , medication compliance . Laboratory test Hemogram , biochemical test include blood glucose , liver function test , prothrombin time , serum electrolyte , blood urea serum creatinine do baseline subsequently end 1 month , 3 month 6 month . Alcohol Breath Test All participant undergo alcohol breath-testing monthly 6 month . A breath-test consider positive participant submits test great 0.01 % Blood Alcohol Concentration . If result great 0.01 % Blood Alcohol Concentration return test re-administered ( second testing ) 15 minute initial test . A proforma include date , time breath-test , breath-test reading signature name person administer breath-test maintain . Follow-up All patient follow 6 month death . The status alive dead assess telephone family member contact death registry patient 's birth place place residence .</detailed_description>
