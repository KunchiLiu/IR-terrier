	<detailed_description>Corneal abrasion ( CA ) one common eye injury , account 10 % eye-related emergency visits.1 A 1985 survey show around 3 % visit US general practitioner corneal abrasion . In addition , 2008 , approximately 27,450 work-related eye injury illnesses occur cause missed time work.1Due large number nerve ending even small corneal injury produce significant pain . The discomfort typically pronounce first 24-48 hour , many case show loss time work disruption daily activity . The current standard care emergency department include topical analgesia antibiotic change oral analgesic upon discharge . Despite ineffectiveness oral analgesic treat CA pain , physicians prescribe topical analgesic base standard medical teaching . This teaching extrapolate data case report animal study report complication associate long-term use ; include addiction , infection , ulceration , increase healing time . Previous study also reject topical analgesia cite equivocal effectiveness inconclusive safety data . However , early human case report describe patient used topical anesthetic inappropriatelyâ€”either far frequently , prolong treatment period , concentrate anesthetic . Contrary medical cannon , study begin show effectiveness topical anesthetic reduce pain , safe application give low dos give quantity last 24-48 hour . A recent prospective , randomized trial , publish Academic Emergency Medicine , observe efficacy safety tetracaine compare normal saline 116 patient present uncomplicated CA . The intervention either undiluted topical tetracaine hydrochloride 1 % saline , apply every 30 minute 24 hour . The study show topical tetracaine use 24 hour safe , reveal difference complication two group , individual attain full healing within 1 month . Additionally , median visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain score low tetracaine group study time point presentation , however statistical significance observe . Furthermore , patient survey overall effectiveness reveal patient perceived tetracaine significantly effective saline . In fact , several researcher recommend short-term use tetracaine eye drop 24 hour pain relief simple corneal abrasion become routine practice . Nevertheless skeptics supporter agree research need order appropriately establish topical analgesic standard care . The importance conduct research management CA underscore significant impact topical analgesic may provide relive patient pain compare standard treatment . The study 's aim investigate role tetracaine outpatient management CA utilizing model already establish ensure safety . This study employ prospective , double blind , randomize control model compare undiluted 1 % tetracaine hydrochloride normal saline patient present ED uncomplicated corneal abrasion . Tetracaine supply three plastic prefilled , commercially available vial , contain 0.5 mL preservative-free , undiluted 1 % tetracaine hydrochloride ( total 1.5 mL approximately 50 drop provide avoid overuse ) . Saline also supply three plastic prefilled , commercially available vial , plastic bullet . Follow visit call provide 48 hour reevaluate symptom asses patient perceive pain use VAS provide participant introduction packet inform consent process . STUDY PROCEDURES . Study visit parameter measure Patients assess use VAS upon follow 48 hour . Patients also evaluate complication either phone follow-up visit , participant discretion . All patient encourage follow ophthalmology as-per standard protocol . c. Drugs use ( dose , method , schedule administration , dose modification , toxicity ) , include Toxicity Grading Scale ( applicable ) Tetracaine supply three plastic prefilled , commercially available vial , contain 0.5 mL preservative-free , undiluted 1 % tetracaine hydrochloride ( total 1.5 mL approximately 50 drop provide avoid overuse ) . Patient instruct use 1-2 drop affect eye every 30 minute awake 24-48 hour STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 1 . List variable definition Variables include perceive pain use VAS , overall perceive effectiveness solution provide . 2 . Outcome measure , endpoints The outcome interest weather-or-not tetracaine superior placebo control pain cause CA 3 . Type analysis A two sample T-test use compare average pain scale tetracaine placebo group 4 . Sample size 100-200 patient expect</detailed_description>
