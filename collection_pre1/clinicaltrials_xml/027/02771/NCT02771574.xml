	<brief_title>Efficacy , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Subcutaneous Exendin ( 9-39 ) Patients With Post Bariatric Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia ( PBH ) rare , increasingly report disease occur bariatric surgery , characterize severe hypoglycemic episode accompany symptom hypoglycemia . At moment , medical therapy develop disorder , clinical need great . The major contributory factor think exaggerated secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) due alter nutrient transit bariatric surgery . GLP-1 incretin hormone secrete primarily distal ileum contribute postprandial glucose regulation . Exendin ( 9-39 ) specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist , give via continuous IV infusion , show effectively prevent postprandial hypoglycemia reduce symptom hypoglycemia patient PBH . This study design assess efficacy , safety pharmacokinetic profile novel subcutaneous formulation exendin ( 9-39 ) .</detailed_description>
