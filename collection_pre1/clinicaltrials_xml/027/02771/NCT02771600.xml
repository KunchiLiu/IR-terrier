	<brief_summary>Needle-related procedure important source pain anxiety pediatric patient . Consequently , needle-phobia anxiety common child auto-immune disease immune deficiency may barriers adherence treatment . The use non-pharmacological easy-to-use approach , like Buzzy® device , could alternative adjuvant management procedural pain anxiety child needle-related procedure . This study aim determine feasibility , acceptability satisfaction Buzzy® device procedural pain anxiety relief immunology-rheumatology patient undergo needle-related procedure . The investigator compare Buzzy® device anaesthetic cream ( Maxilene® ) needle-related procedure . The investigator also plan assess feasibility outcome satisfaction nurse child use Buzzy® device . This pilot study refine modify research methodology improve intervention pilot 's efficacy verify within large scale-study . The investigator strongly believe use Buzzy® device immunology rheumatology department could optimise procedural pain anxiety management . Since treatment administer auto-immune disease immune deficiency diseases subcutaneous intramuscular injection , pain anxiety management use non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological intervention prioritize . Given knowledge , investigator feel pilot study potential contribute pain anxiety management child undergo needle-related procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study New Device ( Buzzy® ) Procedural Pain Relief During Needle-Related Procedures Paediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Procedural pain anxiety relief needle-related procedure major concern nurse work Immunology-Rheumatology patient . Treatments autoimmune disease immune deficiency disease administrate subcutaneous intramuscular injection child go countless needle-related procedure long period life . Procedural pain anxiety generates consequence may physiological , psychological emotional . Since impossible completely control pain anxiety experience pediatric patient painful procedure , non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological intervention part intervention provide comfort child . Interventions decrease physical emotional impact needle-related procedure integral part nursing activity . Most pain anxiety management method available child require much time staff , represent barrier implantation among nursing intervention . Use rapid easy-to-use non-pharmacological intervention could overcome constraint optimise pain anxiety relief child . Investigators believe Buzzy® device , combine cold vibration , could efficient way improve pain anxiety management needle-related procedure . To date , study focus efficacy device pediatric immunology-rheumatology patient . Objective : To assess feasibility , acceptability satisfaction new device ( Buzzy® ) combine effect cold vibration , procedural pain relief anxiety needle-related procedure pediatric immunology-rheumatology patient . Methods . Design : This study pilot study two-group randomized control trial ( RCT ) . Setting : Immunology-Rheumatology clinic CHU Sainte-Justine 's ( Montreal ) . Inclusion criterion : We include child : ) age 4 17 year old ; b ) visit Immunology-Rheumatology Clinic follow-up ; c ) require s/c injection IM injection venipuncture IV catheter insertion ; ) understand French English ; e ) least one parent understand , read talk French English . Exclusion criterion : We exclude child : ) diagnose neuro-cognitive disability preclude patient assent participate study , b ) inability self-report pain . Sample size : We expect recruit 100 participant pilot study ( 50 participant per group ) . Allocations : According randomized list , patient allocate one study group : ) Experimental group : Just needle-related procedure , Buzzy® device , combine ice pack vibration integrate plastic bee , apply 5 cm needle insertion site maintain place throughout painful procedure ; b ) Control group : Maxilene® topical anaesthetic cream apply 30 minute needle-related procedure insertion site . Primary outcome : Post-procedural pain measure Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) ( 4-12 year old ) Numerical Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) ( &gt; 12 year old ) . Secondary outcome : Post-procedural anxiety measure Procedure Behavior Check List ( PBCL ) . We also assess satisfaction nurse child regard Buzzy® device . Satisfaction measure use questionnaire previously develop investigator . The principal feasibility outcomes recruitment rate , refusal rate , needle-related procedure rate time procedure . Study time period : Four study time period plan : T-0 : randomization ; T-1 : 5 min . needle-related procedure ( pre-procedural pain pre-procedural anxiety ) ; T-2 : immediately needle-related procedure ( post-procedural pain post-procedural anxiety ) ; T-3 : 15 min . needle-related procedure ( satisfaction feasibility outcomes ) . Data analysis : Descriptive statistic use group characteristic . Quantitative multivariate analysis perform compare group pre- post-procedural pain anxiety . Descriptive statistic use report satisfaction feasibility outcomes . ANCOVA use covariate increase statistical power . Relevance : This pilot study assess effect new device pain anxiety level immunology-rheumatology patient needle-related procedure test feasibility study design well acceptability new distraction device patient nurse . This study refine research methodology improve intervention pilot future large-scale study .</detailed_description>
