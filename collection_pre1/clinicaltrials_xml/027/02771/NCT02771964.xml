	<brief_summary>This study compare two commonly-used method assess patient-reported quality life . The first ass quality life surgery surgery use validate scale ( ie Veterans Rand 12 ) . The second simply ask patient whether think post-operative quality life well , bad , . The investigator hypothesize second method may inaccurate due cognitive bias .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Change Patient-reported Quality Life After Elective Surgery : Observational Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All preoperative postoperative quality life data come SATISFY-SOS ( NCT02032030 ) survey , administer patient preoperative assessment visit approximately 30 day surgery . To maximize follow-up survey response rate , patient email survey ( ) , mail hard copy survey ( two time ) , phone ( five time ) . The twelve item comprise Veterans RAND 12 ( VR-12 ) item 24 35 survey , self-reported global quality life question item 1 . The VR-12 make two component : physical component score ( PCS ) , mental component score ( MCS ) . Both score continuous scale 0 100 ( high great quality life ) , calibrate score 50 represent US population mean ( Kazis 2006 , Selim 2009 ) . The 30-day follow-up questionnaire also ask patient self-report change quality life . The question ask , `` How would rate quality life ? '' answer choice include `` Better procedure , '' `` The procedure , '' `` Worse procedure . '' Surgical specialty procedure obtain electronic medical record . Using query MetaVision ( iMDsoft , Needham , MA ) , informaticist provide request survey medical record data investigator . He perform rigorous data validation query variable . SATISFY-SOS database host firewall-secured network server manage Department Anesthesiology . The server securely house behind two locked door within departmental office suite maintain manage departmental IT team . Only project Informaticist , Data Manager , Director ( ) full access database , also password-protected encrypt additional protection . Hardcopies baseline survey collect daily CPAP clinic securely store behind two locked door within Department Anesthesiology . Baseline complete paper survey scan digital image format ( compressed TIFF ) . The digital image file indexed store research file server attach private network public access . Survey email , mail call list generate Washington University similar manner mailing list billing service . For patient date service , unique ID generate never duplicate . This unique ID nonsensical meaningful research team . Baseline survey process Solutions Data Systems . The digital image file transmit Solutions Data Systems via secure file transfer protocol . When data entry confirm , Solutions Data Systems delete digital image file server . Press Ganey , vendor specialize patient survey distribution collection , disseminates , collect , process 30-day 1-year survey . Paper survey process automated scan manually check , manager listen 10 % telephone survey . All telephone survey record available future quality check performance improvement . Press Ganey store survey hardcopies 90 day study team conduct spot-check quality assessment scan data . The company shred paper copy . Similarly , Press Ganey hold copy electronic file electronic recording 90 day , electronic file remove permanently system ( maintain Washington University ) . During 90-day period , study team conduct additional quality assessment convert data . Sample size consideration study base primary outcome . The first component primary endpoint compare median quality life score among three self-reported change group ( better/same/worse ) . Using minimum important difference five point ( Norman 2003 ) , two tail , alpha 0.05 , 80 % power , require sample size 77 patient per group , 231 total patient among three group . The second component primary outcome agreement two quality life measure , reflect kappa statistic . Kappa sample size requirement beyond lack sparse cell . The third component primary outcome comparing percentage agreement across three different self-reported change group . Since study perform type comparison previously , investigator pre-specified 10 % change minimum important change . Estimating 80 % agreement , use two tail , alpha=0.05 , 80 % power , require total sample size 311 per group , 933 total patient . Therefore , study adequate power endpoint . The following statistical analysis perform , use alpha=0.05 95 percent confidence interval , appropriate . All analysis perform twice , VR-12 physical quality life , VR-12 mental quality life . - Compare change VR-12 QOL score answer better/same/worse ( Kruskal-Wallis ) . If significant , use Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test compare three group , use Bonferroni correction alpha=0.017 . - Calculate overall agreement self-reported validate quality life measure ( use weight kappa , penalize disagreement proportion seriousness ) . - Calculate overall percent patient whose self-reported validate quality life score match ( descriptive ) , include stratification self-reported global change better/same/worse ( compare use chi-square ) . - Calculate quality life equal proportion patient report good quality life ( MCID improvement ) , bad quality life ( MCID deterioration ) . This anchor-based approach ( Wright 2012 ) - Describe change VR-12 score percent patient report well , , bad quality life follow surgical specialty : neurosurgery , orthopedic , plastic , ophthalmologic , general , cardiac , gynecologic , otolaryngology , gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary , urologic , `` . '' Only answer self-reported quality life question least ten twelve VR-12 question baseline 30 day include . The investigator describe characteristic without miss data . Multiple imputation use fill miss measurement miss two few item VR-12 questionnaire .</detailed_description>
