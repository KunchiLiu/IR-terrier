	<brief_title>The Use Videoconferencing Monitoring Patients Post Urologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As healthcare system America evolving , doctor become hard-pressed see treat patient amount time . Over past century , different form `` telemedicine '' allow doctor treat patient distance , hop increase access medical care . Several study evaluate utility telemedicine ICU setting , namely use video-conferencing technology allow ICU attend physician monitor patient audio video medium closely . A prospective , step-wedge study Lily show use telemedicine reduce adjust odds mortality length stay ICU , well several complication stress ulcer , deep venous thromboses , ventilator associate pneumonia . Similar conclusion find meta-analysis 2011 look 176 tele-ICU article , include 41,374 patient . With telemedicine technology , intensivists theoretically 24-hour oversight ICU remote location , possibly able oversee multiple unit . Although average urology patient require frequent monitoring ICU patient , telemedicine may still play role facilitate care postoperative urologic patient . In 2004 , Ellison el al conduct study compare patient satisfaction patient see via standard bedside round , patient see via telerounds ( additional visit ) laptop computer , patient see via telerounds remotely control robot . This study show telerounding ( either latter two arm ) associate great patient satisfaction postoperative care , find link physician availability4 . In 2007 , author conduct randomized study investigate morbidity , length stay , patient satisfaction standard bedside round versus robotic telerounding . There difference outcomes two group . A significant limitation robotic telerounding cost . Having maintain robot cost around $ 60,000 per year , although Gandas et al able find positive financial impact use robot postoperative gastric bypass patients6 . However , development tablet computer , user-friendly video-conferencing application , make telemedicine affordable tool . In 2012 , Kacsmarek et al conduct first study use tablet computer investigate post-operative patient satisfaction . Their study demonstrate tablet telerounding significantly enhance patient ' post-operative experience provide quick face-to-face access attend physician . Our study would first randomize study investigate use video conferencing via tablet computer versus traditional bedside round effect clinical data length stay complication well patient satisfaction . As technology improves , medicine obligation incorporate technology improve efficiency cost-effectiveness . If telerounding proven change outcomes patient satisfaction , save time physician office hour see patient productive way . Telerounding could apply remote area dearth specialist , allow specialist ' expertise reach area could .</detailed_description>
