	<brief_summary>This clinical trial conduct within research project 'Computerized Lung Sound Analysis ' . The research goal development system enable automatic classification lung sound , result decision support system physician . The objective trial create small lung sound corpus , enable development prototype described system . Therefore , investigator record lung sound several lung sound transducer distribute posterior chest human test subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computerized Lung Sound Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical trial investigator record lung sound posterior chest human test subject . The subject either lung-healthy ( control group ) subject pneumothorax condition pulmonary fibrosis . The lung sound recorded supine position examination table . A foam pad several lung sound transducer place back subject . During record subject wear nose clip hold pneumotachograph hand . The subject instruct breath certain airflow rate inspiration , natural breathing expiration . For subject investigator simultaneously record 30 second airflow signal lung sound 16 lung sound transducer .</detailed_description>
