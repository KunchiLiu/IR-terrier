	<brief_summary>This multi-centre prospective study blood sample take 1500 male patient age 21-80 scheduled prostate biopsy . Analysis cell-free cancer DNA extract sample undertaken determine whether copy number instability score derive cfDNA correlate PSA screening level prostate biopsy result ( i.e . Gleason score ) patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) Men With Elevated PSA Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prostate common site cancer men 240,000 new case diagnose annually United States approximately 28,000 yearly death . Prostate screen typically rely digital rectal exam ( DRE ) prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level . Limitations PSA test include low sensitivity low specificity inability distinguish low-grade high-grade lesion . Recent screen trial suggest PSA-based screening program result small reduction mortality , significant treatment-related adverse event ( AEs ) . Better serum/plasma biomarkers need supplement PSA test diagnosis management disease multiplicity presentation clinical outcome . Cancer-derived DNA present peripheral blood ( referred cell-free DNA cfDNA ) first report 1948 , research area remain dormant state 50 year . Over last ten year however , development Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) use massive parallel array allow researcher create database robust enough distinguish normal genomic non-diploid cfDNA . In 2008 , fetal trisomy chromosome 21 detect analyze cfDNA maternal blood . Since , method validate trisomy 13 , 18 , 21 clinical laboratory procedure remarkable accuracy &gt; 99 % . Recently , cancer derive cfDNA demonstrate recapitulate genomic tumor DNA . Current clinical acceptance utility cfDNA cancer diagnosis demonstrate multiple abstract 2014 2015 ASCO meeting Chicago . In recent publication Clinical Chemistry , researcher Vanderbilt University , Gottingen , Germany , University Toronto , Canada , analyze cfDNA bloodstream healthy control compare clinically diagnosed prostate cancer . The result study demonstrate possible distinguish prostate cancer healthy control without prior knowledge genetic signature tumor three time sensitivity FDA-approved blood test prostate cancer ( i.e. , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ) . The study examine serum 200 subject prostate cancer 200 control . The comparative data include PSA level prostate tissue biopsy grading ( referred Gleason score ) . The technique distinguish prostate cancer normal control 84 % accuracy cancer benign hyperplasia prostatitis accuracy 91 % . Because method quantifies inherent chromosomal instability cancer follow function time ( without invasive tissue biopsy ) , call `` liquid biopsy . '' This multi-centre clinical study analyze cfDNA subject schedule prostate biopsy design validate result obtain above-mentioned retrospective study . If validate , prostate cfDNA determination test provide non-invasive test aid diagnosis prostate cancer , well provide guidance whether biopsy perform . With regard study procedure use , study subject undergo routine venipuncture ~20 millilitres blood ( approximately 2 tablespoon ) collect . The blood process Sponsor 's laboratory send Sponsor 's test facility Gottingen , Germany .</detailed_description>
