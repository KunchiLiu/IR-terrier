	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) condition involve episode interrupt breathe sleep due repetitive narrowing collapse throat . These episode usually associate drop blood oxygen level brief awakening , disrupt sleep affect lead daytime sleepiness . OSA associate increase risk heart disease stroke . In individual , low oxygen level blood make bad also small hole heart , call patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) . This hole present birth everyone , people ( 30 % normal population ) fail close . Usually PFO cause medical problem . However , may recommend PFO close key-hole surgery someone suffers stroke , severe migraine professional diver . There high incidence PFO patient OSA ( 25-50 % ) compare wide population may account observe increase risk heart disease stroke patient OSA . This study assess number patient OSA also PFO , whether close PFO improve symptom OSA ( e.g . sleepiness , exercise capacity general well-being ) , thereby enable patient reliant treatment OSA . If study show close PFO beneficial investigator assess large study treatment also reduce heart disease stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Under normal condition interatrial communication allow blood shunt leave right due high pressure leave atrium right atrium great compliance right ventricle leave ventricle . Right-to-left interatrial shunting ( RLS ) usually associate spontaneous induced pulmonary hypertension . RLS may occur spontaneously release phase Valsalva manoeuvre transiently generates right leave pressure gradient across interatrial septum rarely due condition term platypnea-orthodeoxia . The latter characterize dyspnoea deoxygenation accompany change sit stand recumbent position . Platypnea-orthodeoxia thought due combination interatrial communication anatomical variant e.g . persistent Eustachian valve and/or stretch distortion atrial septum allow stream venous blood inferior vena cava defect upright position . The recommended treatment platypnea-orthodeoxia percutaneous closure patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) . Obstructive Sleep Apnoea - Hypopnoea Syndrome ( OSAHS ) characterise repetitive upper airway obstruction sleep cause apnoea ( cessation breathe ) oxygen desaturation . It significant health burden National Health Service ( NHS ) society , affect approximately 4 % middle age men 2 % middle-aged woman . The risk OSAHS rise increase body weight , active smoking age . OSAHS set reach epidemic proportion Western population age incidence obesity rise . About 1 % men United Kingdom ( UK ) severe OSAHS apnoea-hypopnoea index ( AHI ; average number episodes apnoeas hypopnoeas per hour sleep ) &gt; 20 oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ; number desaturation episode define ≥4 % drop oxygen saturation per hour sleep ) &gt; 20 , measure nocturnal oximetry respiratory polygraphy ( intermediate sleep study Embletta™ ) . Patients untreated severe OSAHS high incidence fatal ( OR 2.87 ) non-fatal ( OR 3.17 ) cardiovascular event compare age sex match control . The degree oxygen desaturation inversely correlate survival link think multifactorial ; raise blood viscosity due increase haematocrit , sympathetic activation lead arrhythmias systemic hypertension think important . In Cox model 1 % decrease average nocturnal oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) associate 33 % increase incident risk fatal nonfatal cardiovascular event . Treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) ventilation night reduces symptom ( snore , mood , day time sleepiness headache ) cardiovascular event rate , poorly tolerate refuse fifth patient . Improvement ODI sleepiness OSAHS treat CPAP transient CPAP discontinue , measurement return baseline within 1 week . PFO find high incidence patient OSAHS control ( 69 % vs. 17 % ) may exacerbate oxygen desaturation OSAHS apnoeic/ hypopnoeic episode observe patient . In OSAHS patient great ODI AHI ratio ( ODI/AHI &gt; 0.67 ) , prevalence large PFO nine 15 ( 60 % ) versus two 15 ( 13 % ) ODI/AHI &lt; 0.33 . OSAHS believe raise right heart pressure increase RLS via interatrial defect due repeat nocturnal Valsalva Muller manoeuvre . Prolonged oxygen desaturation may exacerbate sleep apnoea decrease central respiratory drive . In selected population OSAHS patient , PFO closure may beneficial . This report number case report study large trial population . Hypothesis : RLS via PFO patient severe OSAHS : ESS≥11 ODI≥20 ODI/AHI &gt; 0.67 , deleterious closing PFO improve oxygen saturation , exercise tolerance , symptom , quality life reduce CPAP requirement , ultimately , reduce incidence fatal/ non-fatal cardiovascular event . This study ass improvement symptom OSA ( e.g . sleepiness , exercise capacity general well-being ) follow PFO closure . Improving symptom enable patient reliant treatment OSA . If PFO closure beneficial investigator aim assess efficacy treatment reduce heart disease stroke large study .</detailed_description>
