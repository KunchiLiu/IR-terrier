	<brief_summary>The pain associated disorder masticatory system ( DAM ) include pain masticatory muscle , temporomandibular joint , deux.1-5 In term frequency , DAM second musculoskeletal disorder common behind chronic pain do . Pain associate DAM interested adult ; also observe adolescent ( 2-6 % ) 7 significant change quality life.8 The annual incidence pain associate DAM 2.6 % among adolescent 3.9 % adult . 9 half two-thirds patient affect DAM resort professional care , one-third continue subjected moderate pain incapacity severe , regardless treatment give . Co-morbidities identified adult 12-14 , child adolescent pain related DAM , United States Su√®de . The common painful co-morbidities among child adolescent headache , neck , back , limbs abdomen . The reason co-existence DAM painful condition well understood . Nevertheless , demonstrate adult contribute apparition persistence DAM beyond heal time conventionally predict ; increase deterioration state health could complicate significantly diagnosis efficacy treatment . Co-morbidity define `` simultaneous existence occur two disease , medically diagnosed person . The prevalence several chronic painful condition appear great among people low socioeconomic status compare high high socioeconomic status among woman hommes . head pain commonly report general population ( 46 % ) The headache prevalence range 9 % 97 % among adults 30 % 94 % among Adolescents DAM . Women high probability pain related DAM ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.2 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 2.1-2.4 ) headache ( OR = 2.5 , 95 % CI : 2.4-2.5 ) men . Cross-sectional study case-control demonstrated subject DAM-related pain 1.5 8.8 time likely headache compare without pain associate DAM . The relationship headaches DAM n ` est unclear . Both condition seem share similar pathophysiological mechanism would promote development disease individual . Patients affect headache likely develop DAM ? A cohort study show adolescent affected headache , chance develop pain relate DAM 2.7 time ( 95 % CI : 1.6-4.4 ) adolescent without headache . Conversely , probability headache increase number symptom accord relationship DAM . Following result study cite , necessary confirm relationship headache DAM among adolescent . Neck pain back symptoms commonly report adult DAM ( 35 % 44 % ) . 23 The adult affect DAM small mobility angle cervical sensitive point trapezoid compare without DAM . Cross-sectional study case-control demonstrated adult patient DAM-related pain 2.6 5 time likely back pain individual without pain related DAM . Chances pain joint ( OR = 4.0 , 95 % CI : 3.7-4.3 ) large among adult affect DAM relate pain compare indemnes . adult affect DAM-related pain also likely experience neck pain ( OR = 4.0 7.9 ) . Adult woman affect DAM-related pain likely pain neck ( OR = 1.5 ; 95 % CI : 1.4-1.8 ) back ( OR = 1.2 ; 95 % CI : 1.2-1.3 ) compare hommes prospective cohort study demonstrate great likelihood pain related DAM among adolescent affect back pain compare affected ( OR = 3.0 , 95 % CI : 2.2-6.8 ) Our study aim seek evidence suppose relationship pain related DAM sore neck back adolescent population . The irritable bowel syndrome ( CIS ; 9 % 16 % ) , interstitial cystitis ( 17 % ) , stomach pain ( 34 % ) rat among adult affect DAM . Adults affect DAM 2.7 time ( 95 % CI : 1.4-5.1 ) likely irritable bowel syndrome subject age affect . teenager affect DAM 1.5 time ( 95 % CI : 1.0- 2.1 ) luck stomach upset subject age unaffected .</brief_summary>
