	<detailed_description>The primary objective : 1 ) To localize change follow mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) subject vision dysfunction use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . 2 ) To demonstrate effectiveness neuro vision rehabilitation ( NVR ) vision dysfunction initiate within nine month follow mTBI normalize objective visual measurement well change fMRI DTI . Mild ( TBI ) comprise 80 % 3.65 million brain injury United States cost estimate 17 billion dollar annually . Mild TBI challenge diagnosis disable severe TBI chronic symptom develop . In past several year , researcher find somewhat silent majority mTBI patient develop last symptom concurrent vision dysfunction . This cohort patient post-traumatic visual difficulty , regardless mechanism injury , seem demonstrate significant lasting disability poorer overall outcome TBI cohort , yet correlation adequately study . The study perform find visual dysfunction may spontaneously improve become chronic absence direct diagnosis treatment . Time injury show study influence incidence frequency visual difficulty identify , pervasive visual dysfunction significantly improve response intervention prescription glass NVR . For past 16 month , Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) University Minnesota ( U M ) TBI Center Hennepin County Medical Center ( HCMC ) closely collaborate pilot study . The goal study identify location brain post traumatic visual change acute mTBI subject ( &lt; 9 month injury date , age 18-55 ) use rest state task fMRI DTI . Mild TBI subject vision dysfunction ( vision group ) compare mTBI subject vision difficulty ( control ) . Task fMRI image demonstrate significant decreased brain activity vision dysfunction subject compare control certain key vision area . Diffusion tensor imaging show significant change certain area corpus callosum . This trial design longitudinal clinical study . Fifteen mTBI patient vision dysfunction ( vision group ) fit inclusion/exclusion criterion 15 patient mTBI finding visual screen ( control group ) within 9 month injury include study . No subject exclude basis sex/gender , race ethnicity . These mTBI subject initially identify physician HCMC TBI Clinic . If agreeable , consent obtain HCMC well prior baseline MRI scan CMRR . The subject undergo objective test specialized eye doctor HCMC confirm vision dysfunction relate mTBI . At CMRR , within 2 week visual testing , whole brain image use rest state task fMRI DTI use 3T MRI machine . The subject receive neurovision rehabilitation approximately 3 month HCMC vision group . This treatment standard care population . Both group undergo repeat objective vision test specialize eye doctor 3 6 month confirm vision dysfunction resolve . Resting state task fMRI DTI do time compare functional structural connectivity change 2 group . Mild TBI significant cause disability especially symptoms become chronic . In HCMC 's clinical experience , chronicity often link vision difficulty . Vision dysfunction continue properly identify treat , especially neuro vision rehabilitation . The goal research study good understand cerebral structural metabolic change associate well effectiveness neuro vision rehabilitation post traumatic vision dysfunction utilize rest state task fMRI DTI . A positive outcome significant impact diagnosis care considerable number mTBI patient suffer vision dysfunction , especially neurovision rehabilitation utilized medical community . In turn , overall functional outcome mTBI improve , greatly relieve suffer disability patient .</detailed_description>
