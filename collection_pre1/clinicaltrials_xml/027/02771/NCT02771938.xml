	<brief_summary>Many woman breast cancer live decade breast cancer treatment . In view , modern breast reconstruction surgery mastectomy breast cancer aim reproduce natural breast shape possible . Keeping natural breast appearance show important woman 's emotional psychological recovery . Breast cancer treatment often include combination surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , anticancer tablet Tamoxifen , newer target drug Herceptin . Radiotherapy usually give surgery . However , radiotherapy mastectomy breast reconstruction damage 'new ' breast give less good breast shape appearance long term . Also , recovery slow follow surgery , radiotherapy delay may reduce effectiveness . Changing order treatment show safe effective chemotherapy , Herceptin anticancer tablet little information give radiotherapy breast cancer surgery . The investigator want find give radiotherapy mastectomy reconstruction alters surgical complication rate want evaluate appearance reconstruct breast radiotherapy give surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Primary Radiotherapy And DIEP flAp Reconstruction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer outcomes equivalent regardless order systemic treatment surgery trend towards improve overall survival woman age &lt; 50 year receive chemotherapy surgery . Adjuvant post-mastectomy chest wall RT show local survival benefit particularly high risk patient . Accordingly , patient T3/T4 breast cancer and/or significant burden axillary disease commonly receive treatment sequence comprise primary chemotherapy follow mastectomy immediate autologous reconstruction , increasingly use abdominal fat ( DIEP reconstruction ) , finally adjuvant radiotherapy affect chest wall +/‑ supraclavicular fossa . There precedent use upfront ( neoadjuvant ) radiotherapy ( NART ) follow complex cancer surgery . For example , rectal cancer , substantial evidence use neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy follow aggressive surgical excision standard care patient threaten involved circumferential margin . Short‑course preoperative radiotherapy test multiple trial rectal cancer , include Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial , Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group Study recently Medical Research Council CR07 trial . All three study demonstrate well local control improve disease‑free overall survival . Flap reconstruction perineum time abdomino‑perineal resection well describe method reduce perineal morbidity indicate primary closure achieve wide local resection . By transfer bulk vascularize soft tissue irradiate pelvis , flap reconstruction show reduce infection rate , fill pelvic dead space , prevent wound dehiscence , reduce time heal . 'Short course ' pre‑operative rectal radiotherapy : surgery generally undertaken 7‑10 day completion radiotherapy acceptable impact post‑operative complication rate . There one publish series NART breast cancer report acceptable post‑operative complication rate . Following , surgeon clinical oncologist Imperial College Royal Marsden begin develop limited experience mastectomy DIEP reconstruction 14 day follow completion radiotherapy ( 10 case , significant post‑operative complication ) . This non-randomised phase II study set formally evaluate safety reverse order mastectomy plus immediate DIEP flap reconstruction adjuvant radiotherapy , view subsequent randomise control trial test local control cosmetic outcome .</detailed_description>
