	<brief_title>Tenofovir Alafenamide Fumarate ( TAF ) Effect Residual Intrathecal Immune Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infect central nervous system ( CNS ) early infectious course establishes chronic infection markedly increase intrathecal immune activation . Modern antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) effective supress HIV blood lymph system , also CNS . After commencement ART , marker intrathecal immune activation cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) neopterin decrease markedly , remain slightly increase substantial number patient despite several year receive ART . CSF marker immune activation correlate marker neuronal injury axonal marker neurofilament light protein ( NFL ) find slightly increase asymptomatic patient compare HIV-negative control despite effective ART . This indicate linkage inflammation neuronal injury , however , long-term effect low-grade immune activation within CNS know . CSF neopterin correlate also level CSF HIV RNA patient ART measure ultrasensitive method range 0.3-20 copies/mL highlight potential CNS serve viral reservoir persistent infection cause subclinical CNS injury . There several indication abacavir could act pro-inflammatory , factor might influence propose increase risk coronary heart disease abacavir treatment . Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate ( TAF ) new prodrug tenofovir interest difference compare currently use prodrug , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) . Both TDF TAF require conversion active drug tenofovir diphosphate ( DP ) . TDF convert initially tenofovir blood , tenofovir take cell . In lymphocyte , macrophage , cell , phosphorylated DP form . TAF , however , largely deliver TAF lymphocytes macrophage , metabolize intracellularly tenofovir phosphorylated active tenofovir DP . Thus , plasma level tenofovir much low TAF TDF , tenofovir DP level much high within lymphocyte macrophage . This large interest since macrophage microglia ( tissue macrophage ) main target cell HIV CNS . A longitudinal study HIV CNS ongoing since 30 year Gothenburg , Sweden . Subjects follow clinical follow annual lumbar puncture ( LP ) , ART . Blood sample perform parallel . The study protocol approve Regional Ethical Review Board Gothenburg patient include write informed consent . This pilot study find interesting change treatment switch idea continue large study design dependent result enough power demonstrate difference . However , result study presented scientific publication irrespective outcome . 1 . No change CSF viral load CSF immune activation switch . . This outcome reassure high effect CNS also TAF 2 . Decrease CSF immune activation switch abacavir ( ABC ) /lamivudine ( 3TC ) . This would interest find case need test large set . 3 . Decrease CSF viral load and/or CSF immune activation switch group . This unlikely outcome would imply increased intracellular concentration tenofovir DP macrophage microglia could decrease ongoing low-grade replication brain 4 . Increase CSF immune activation switch one two group . This highly unlikely outcome</detailed_description>
