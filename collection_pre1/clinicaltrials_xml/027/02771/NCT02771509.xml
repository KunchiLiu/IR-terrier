	<brief_title>Study Prevent Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery Involving Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Angion Biomedica Corp. develop small molecule hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor ( HGF/SF ) mimetic , term BB3 , exert significant nephroprotective effect several preclinical renal injury model . Angion intend develop BB3 therapy prevent and/or treat acute kidney injury . BB3 new molecular entity propose treatment novel since drug currently available indication prevent and/or treat acute kidney injury . This randomize , prospective , parallel-group , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients undergo surgical procedure involve CPB elevate risk pre-surgery AKI eligible participate study . Patients randomize 1:1 receive either BB3 placebo ( normal saline ) immediately surgery . Study drug administer total 4 daily intravenous ( IV ) infusion . The first post-operative dose MUST start within 4 hour complete CPB . The second dose administer 24 ± 2 hour complete CPB , third fourth dos administer 24 ± 2 hour previous dose . Patients follow safety , PK ( subset patient ) , efficacy Day 90 , Day 1 day first infusion study drug . Patients assessed daily Day 7 Days 14 , 30 90 . Efficacy endpoint include assessment post-CPB renal injury , express percent increase sCr Baseline time maximum percent increase sCr follow CPB , 24 hour end CPB Day 5 ; proportion patient reach KDIGO stage AKI specify time point Day 30 ; analysis among patient develop AKI assess time recovery reduction KDIGO stage . Approximately 100 patient randomize ; 50 patient randomize BB3 50 patient placebo .</detailed_description>
