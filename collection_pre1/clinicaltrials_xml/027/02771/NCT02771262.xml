	<brief_summary>Dyspnea , uncomfortable labor breathing , important patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) . It primary disable symptom chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . There high priority improve dyspnea PRO assessment predict exacerbation . Frequent exacerbation associate increased disability , decrease quality life ( QOL ) , accelerate lung function decline . Goals : To test relative sensitivity change , responsiveness predictive validity comprehensive dyspnea outcome computer adaptive test ( CAT ) measure new anxiety activity avoidance domains efficient administer exist dyspnea scale . Expected Outcomes : Investigators expect : 1. begin transform dyspnea assess ; 2. improve dyspnea symptom management ; 3. impact functional status ; 4. improve QOL ; 5. facilitate earlier treatment prevention exacerbation ; 6. improve COPD prognosis survival ; 7. improve COPD healthcare utilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Theoretical Background : COPD research practice focus predominately evaluate treat sensory component dyspnea . However , dyspnea ( like pain ) complex symptom sensory affective component . Current dyspnea scale limit scope measure sensory component dyspnea , high respondent data collection burden and/or high measurement error . Only sensory dyspnea date use classify COPD severity . The DMQ-CAT address limitation dyspnea scale use state-of-the-art item bank method technique provide tailor multidimensional dyspnea assessment use minimal number item . The 71-item DMQ-CAT capture four distinct dyspnea construct : intensity , anxiety , activity avoidance , self-efficacy evaluate outcome COPD pharmacologic , pulmonary rehabilitation , cognitive-behavioral therapy . The DMQ-CAT show evidence minimal ceiling floor effect , acceptable Rasch model fit statistic , high internal consistency reliability , good accuracy compare total item pool , good excellent concurrent known-groups validity . The relative sensitivity change , responsiveness , predictive validity DMQ-CAT currently know . Hypotheses : The DMQ-CAT superior sensitivity change responsiveness compare widely use COPD dyspnea scale . The DMQ-CAT superior predictive validity compare dyspnea measure predict acute COPD exacerbation incidence severity . Study Design : To achieve Aims 1 2 , investigator use prospective observational design target sample 110 pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) outpatients COPD . The investigator use distribution-based statistic compare sensitivity change dyspnea instrument include : effect size , standardize response mean ( SRM ) , standardize error measurement ( SEM ) , percentage participant exceed minimal detectable change ( MDC90 ) baseline discharge PR . The investigator estimate minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) DMQ-CAT compare percentage participant exceed MCID threshold use establish MCIDs dyspnea instrument . For Aim 3 , investigator use retrospective observational design conduct secondary analysis exist data 240 patient COPD . The investigator use odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) area receiver operator curve ( ROC ) compare predictive validity different dyspnea measure .</detailed_description>
