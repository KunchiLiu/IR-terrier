	<brief_summary>Cerebral energy metabolism decline advance age , implicate age-related cognitive decline , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , form neurodegenerative disease ( Parkinson 's disease ) . In addition , age-associated increase systemic neuroinflammation associate high likelihood development Alzheimer 's disease neurodegenerative disease old adult . Furthermore , decrease cerebral energy metabolism increase neuroinflammation associate deficit cognitive function , even absence neurodegenerative disease . In old adult , decrease cognition strongly associate development AD , increase rate hospitalization , loss functional independence , increase mortality rate . Novel method prevent cognitive decline neurodegenerative disease older adult need world 's age population . Current research suggest nutrient fruit vegetable produce strong anti-oxidant anti-proliferative effect . Most Americans consume minimum recommendation fruit vegetable per day receive benefit . Whole food-based nutritional product , Fermented Papaya Product ( FPP ) , may provide healthy alternative individual . FPP , make bio-fermentation Carica papaya , find enhance antioxidant protection decrease DNA damage healthy old adult . Furthermore , FPP increase cerebral energy metabolism down-regulates neuroinflammation , result effect cognition , dietary supplementation FPP may preventative benefit age-related cognitive condition , include MCI , AD , Parkinson 's disease neurodegenerative disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficient Brain Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design research study conduct double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled pilot study determine whether FPP improve cerebral energy metabolism , neuroinflammation , systemic inflammation , cognitive function , fatigue , health-related quality life old adult . Potential participant participate brief 10 minute phone screen describe study . If participant meet initial inclusion/exclusion criterion phone screen , schedule in-person screen visit . Participants attend five ( 5 ) person visit include one Screening Visit perform individually potential study participant , four Assessment Visits ( V1-V4 ) . Participants ask provide fast blood sample utilized evaluate clinical laboratory parameter Screening visit four assessment visit . The participant complete treatment placebo condition ; therefore , cross-over design use . After eight ( 8 ) week regimens , participant ask complete post-treatment outcome assessment University Florida 's Institute Aging - Clinical Translational Research Building ( IOA - CTRB ) . Following first post-treatment test day ( V2 ) , participant complete six ( 6 ) week washout period return IOA - CTRB complete study arm . The order participant receive FPP placebo determine randomization</detailed_description>
