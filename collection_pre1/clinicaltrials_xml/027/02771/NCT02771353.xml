	<detailed_description>Following publication result two large randomise clinical trial , pan-lymph node radiotherapy ( pan-LN RT ) ( include treatment internal mammary chain ) set become standard treatment patient lymph-node positive breast cancer . Traditional pan-LN RT technique deliver high radiation dos heart lung cause long-term side-effects woman many year treatment . Modern techniques include breath-holding volumetric-modulated arc therapy ( VMAT ) reduce dos heart lungs investigator yet know technique ( ) best term resource cost , short medium-term side-effects , day day accuracy . This study compare time take deliver pan-LN RT use breath-holding versus VMAT collect side-effect data one year follow treatment well model long-term cardiac risk base heart dose deliver . The result main study help guide clinician department select best pan-LN RT technique patient . A parallel study evaluate combination breath-hold VMAT use machine-based technique call active-breathing control ( ABC ) device simple voluntary breath-hold technique patient simply take breath hold 20 second time . These technique compare term day-to-day accuracy . If simpler technique prove accurate ABC-technique , establish simpler technique less resource-intensive standard care adoptable radiotherapy department .</detailed_description>
