	<brief_title>Long-term Efficacy Metacognitive Training Depression ( D-MCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dissemination treatment depression still unsatisfying : every second patient receive , refuse , wait treatment . Moreover , drop-out rate almost 25 % routine clinical practice , 54 % relapse rate treatment responder within two year treatment termination , improve treatment necessary . Metacognitive Training depression ( D-MCT ) , low threshold , easy administer group intervention design fill gap . It aim reduction depressive symptom change cognitive bias ; bias target cognitive behavioral therapy also identify basic research .

Severity depression cognitive bias assess baseline ( t0 ) , post treatment ( t1 ) 6 month ( t2 ) later raters blind diagnostic status . Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrate end treatment , well 6 month later , improvement depression significantly great D-MCT relative health training group medium effect size . A significantly great number patient D-MCT group remission 6-month follow-up . Moreover , decrease cognitive bias increase psychological well-being/quality life large D-MCT health train group time . Aim current study investigate long-term efficacy D-MCT . For purpose , additional 3 year follow-up assessment ( t3 ) conduct . The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS , 17-item version ) total score serf primary outcome . Self-assessed depression , dysfunctional belief , self-esteem , quality life , ability work serve secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
