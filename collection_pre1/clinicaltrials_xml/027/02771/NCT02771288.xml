	<brief_summary>To investigate safety long-term vascular remodel bioresorbable vascular scaffold ( BVS ) implantation stenotic occlude lesion child young adult Kawasaki disease ( KD ) . Background : KD occur worldwide , prevalent Japan East Asian country . Coronary artery lesion predominant determinant KD outcome long-term . Children KD aneurysms least 6 mm maximal diameter great 50 % chance develop clinically significant stenotic lesion follow-up . They risk myocardial infarction-related sudden death congestive heart failure young adult . Bypass surgery could reasonable strategy long-term patency graft remain unsatisfactory . Percutaneous angioplasty drug-eluting stent ( DES ) implantation alternative . However , metallic stenting remain problematic several aspect mainly due restriction vessel expansive remodeling . The novel BVS potential free limitation due scaffold degradation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Vascular Remodelling After BVS Implantation Stenotic Occluded Lesions Children Young Adults With KD .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>conduct single-center , single-group prospective study safety image endpoint . A total 10 KD child young adult indication revascularization enrol , BVS implant stenotic occluded lesion . QCA optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) use evaluate baseline lumen area , plaque characteristic , BVS expansion eccentricity deployment . At 12 month , scaffold restenosis evaluate multislice compute tomography . At 30 month , patient receive follow-up angiography OCT evaluate lumen area , neoplaque characteristic , side branch condition . Otherwise , composite endpoint include cardiac death , myocardial infarction , ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation assess 30 day , 6 9 month , 1 , 2 , 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . In singlegroup prospective study safety image endpoint , total 10 KD patient &lt; 18 year enrol . 2 . The diagnosis KD make base clinical criterion KD . Exclusion criterion : Patients present acute myocardial infarction unstable arrhythmia , severe leave ventricular dysfunction ( ejection fraction le 35 % ) , intrastent restenotic lesion , lesion locate leave main coronary artery , tight lesion could well dilate even rotational atherectomy exclude . Those chronic renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl ) also exclude due limitation OCT ( optical coherence tomography ) use .</criteria>
