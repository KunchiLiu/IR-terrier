	<brief_summary>The purpose study test experimental human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) vaccine use adenovirus vector . The adenovirus vector may help vaccine stimulate immune response . Researchers want see immune system respond vaccine well safe give people . Participants get HIV vaccine . However , researcher also want see vaccine 's adenovirus contagious . Adenoviruses cause cold symptom mild eye infection , therefore household intimate contact ask participate well .</brief_summary>
