	<brief_title>Drug-Targeted Alerts Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) carry significant , independent risk mortality among hospitalized patient . Recent study demonstrate increased mortality among patient even small increase serum creatinine concentration . International guideline treatment AKI focus appropriate management drug dosing , avoid nephrotoxic exposure , careful attention fluid electrolyte balance . Early nephrologist involvement may also improve outcomes AKI . Without appropriate provider recognition AKI , however , none measure take , patient outcome may suffer . AKI frequently overlook clinician , carry substantial cost , morbidity mortality burden . The investigator conduct pilot , randomize trial electronic alert acute kidney injury 2014 . The trial , randomized 2400 patient AKI define increase creatinine 0.3mg/dl 48 hour 50 % 7 day , find alert physician presence AKI improve course acute kidney injury , reduce dialysis death rate . However study conduct single hospital , alert describe specific action provider could take . In present proposal , investigator seek expand upon prior study determine mode alert would effective determine target alert ( patient medication may worsen acute kidney injury ) improve effectiveness . This study randomize , control trial electronic AKI alert system . Using Kidney Disease : Improve Global Outcomes creatinine criterion , inpatient several hospital randomize usual care versus electronic alerting . Alerting target three specific drug class : Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drug , Renin/Angiotensin Blockers , Proton-Pump inhibitor .</detailed_description>
