	<brief_summary>Background Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries one common sport injury knee . ACL reconstruction ( ACLR ) become one common surgical procedure attempt increase joint stability facilitate athlete return sport ( RTS ) . Although ACLR consider relatively successful procedure , dynamic control risk factor strength power deficit involve limb still present patient return sport . Dynamic multi-plane , multi-joint action jumping , landing , change direction cutting , show common mechanisms injury ACL field sport . Returning multidirectional sport require proficiency efficiency movement carry task . There lack standardized , objective criterion accurately ass athlete 's ability safely RTS . Therefore , need research simultaneously analyse sport specific dynamic task ( 3D motion analysis ) muscular strength/power deficit may explain poor outcome follow ACLR . This study aim investigate movement pattern , limb asymmetry muscle strength deficit patient post-surgery identify risk factor re-injury criterion RTS . The purpose study : 1 . Analyse kinematic ( movement descriptor ) kinetic ( force cause movement ) sport specific dynamic task different time-points ( 6 9 month ) follow ACLR . 2 . To explore association finding re-injure , persistent knee pain fail return sport . 3 . To compare ACLR participant age gender match healthy multidirectional athlete . It hypothesise biomechanical analysis identify clear risk factor poor outcome follow ACLR . Analysis ACLR athletes ' biomechanics sport specific task aid identification athlete yet ready return sport inform clinician must target specific rehabilitation protocol return sport consider . Brief protocol Participants recruit patient schedule undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction Sports Surgery Clinic , Ireland . Healthy participant recruit local multidirectional team . Participation voluntary obtaining informed consent patient ask complete pre-operative questionnaire ascertain injury information , function knee . During surgery surgeon fill intra-operative questionnaire . Items record include graft type , laxity , involvement ligamentous structure , type femoral tibial fixation , meniscal chondral pathology . Biomechanical assessment take place 6 9 month post surgery ACL group healthy participant test one occasion . The 3D test session include capture jumping , landing , hop cut mechanic use three dimensional motion capture technology force plate . Here reflective marker place skin anatomical landmark . These marker pick infrared camera track 200 frame per second . Participants make contact force plate foot undertaking movement . Force marker data combine calculate joint angle moment . Participants also perform muscle strength test use equipment call isokinetic dynamometer . Both operate non-operated limb test . Participants also ask fill validate questionnaire monitor self report knee function , confidence knee also collect data continue adverse symptom lock , give way , swell pain . Participants also ask return sport . Questionnaires administer participant pre-op , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 24 month post operatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomechanical Analysis Dynamic Tasks Muscular Strength Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3D Biomechanical test involves follow progressive neuromuscular challenge test : - Single leg countermovement jump - Vertical jump high possible one leg . - Single leg drop jump- Hop 20cm height onto one leg jump high possible little time spend ground - Double leg drop jump- Hop 30cm height onto one leg jump high possible little time spend ground - Hurdle hop - Lateral hop 15cm hurdle follow hop back start position hold 2sec - Single Leg Hop distance - maximal jump horizontal distance one leg stick land - Pre-planned change direction cut - Sprint 5 metre , make 90 degree change direction pre-determined tester sprint five meter finish - Indecision cut - Sprint five meter react light stimulus make 90 degree cut leave right 1.5metres Patient Registry Patient data inputted Sports Surgery Clinic medical data management software . Captured data include : 1 . Patient information - Date Surgery , Surgeon , Side ACLR , confirmative Magnetic Resonance Imaging 2 . Pre-Operative data collection - Pre-Operative Questionnaire- Date injury , Activity undertake injury occur , level sporting activity , Injury mechanism , limb dominance , previous ACL injury surgery . - Marx Activity Questionnaire . - ACL return sport injury ( RSI ) questionnaire- measure athlete 's emotion , confidence performance , risk appraisal relation return sport ACL injury . 3 . Intra-Op data collection - Operative note record theatre use standardise theatre questionnaire . This form develop consensus surgeon complete ACL reconstructive surgery Sports Surgery Clinic . Included graft type , laxity , involvement ligamentous structure , type femoral tibial fixation , meniscal chondral pathology . 4 . 6 Month 9 month post op data collection - Marx Activity Questionnaire - ACL RSI - International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) form- The IKDC subjective form reliable valid measure monitor symptom function daily living activity knee disorder . - Cincinnati Questionnaire - valid reliable measure patient report outcome ACL injury - Sports Surgery Clinic return performance questionnaire- ask whether participant return sport , injure operate knee contralateral knee ask whether still experience pain rate pain numerical rating scale . - 3D test battery finding 5 . 12 24 month post op data collection - Marx Activity Questionnaire - ACL RSI - IKDC - Sports Surgery Clinic return performance questionnaire Quality assurance plan - Weekly cross-checking undertaken two member staff ensure data enter onto registry correct contemporaneous . - A six-monthly audit registry undertaken external auditor . Registry standard operating procedure - Basic patient contact detail inputted administration staff . - Physiotherapists biomechanists input physical examination finding medical data software . - Self-reported questionnaire complete site use tablet device upload automatically registry questionnaire complete . - During theatre , surgeon fill standardise intra-operative form , uploaded registry follow surgery . - For analysis auditing purpose , data download Sports Surgery Clinic medical data management software place Microsoft excel . Patient names de-identified . Sample size - Suggested sample size = 1000 - Sample size calculation carry base current number present clinic . Clinical number indicate re-rupture rate either ipsilateral contralateral ACL 5 % . - This study aim recruit 1000 participant follow 24 month . With likely re-rupture rate 5 % - hypothesize 50 re-ruptures occur 24 month period . This conservative number allow dropout , split contralateral ipsilateral ACL injury , analyse separately . - It also aim recruit 50 healthy volunteer multidirectional field sport team . Plan miss data - Checklist flag miss data end every week - Participants miss data may exclude data analysis . Statistical analysis plan - Variables interest include kinematics , kinetics , power , vertical ground-reaction force pelvis , hip , knee ankle specific time point different jumping , land cut manoeuvre . - Differences involve uninvolved leg calculate , use assess asymmetry . Two group comparison conduct use Student test Kruskal-Wallis test normal non-normally distributed variable , respectively . - Multivariable logistic regression , use variable P value &lt; /=0.05 2-group comparison ( go suffer 2nd ACL injury n't ) , use identify predictive variable second ACL injury . - A multivariable logistic regression analysis also conduct identify predictive variable patient report subjective knee function ( IKDC ) pain . - Associations intra-operative finding outcome measure re-injury pain return sport explore , also use regression analysis .</detailed_description>
