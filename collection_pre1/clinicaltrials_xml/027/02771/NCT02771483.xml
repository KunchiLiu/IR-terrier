	<brief_summary>Giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) medium large vessel vasculitis predilection superficial cranial intrathoracic artery . Diagnosing condition predict patient develop large vessel complication remain challenge . There limitations temporal artery biopsy , magnetic resonance angiography ultrasound temporal artery American College Rheumatology classification criterion . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) show useful modality detect inflammation large intra-thoracic vessel previously able accurately detect FDG uptake superficial cranial artery due poor spatial resolution . Newer scanner perform finer cut head detect uptake artery . This study three main component : 1 . Cross sectional study assess accuracy PET uptake superficial cranial intrathoracic artery suspect GCA patient diagnosis GCA 2 . Cohort study assess prognostic implication FDG aortic uptake aortic diameter 24 month 3 . Cohort study assess Th1 Th17 cytokine profile patient without FDG PET uptake 0 , 6 24 month</brief_summary>
