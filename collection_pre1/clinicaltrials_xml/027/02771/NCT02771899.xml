	<brief_summary>Adults ( 18 year ) child ( 10-17 year age ) schedule surgery correct scoliosis include study , participation last 6 month . Each age group participant randomize two cohort : one cohort receive standard care , also standard radiographic image use construction three-dimensional visualization spine . Questionnaires administer surgery , addition health information collect throughout course study , indicate whether three-dimensional model effect planning , performance , outcomes surgery . Participants study ask anything outside standard care . The manipulate variable study construction three dimensional model , make information collect standard care , require action participant 's behalf . The result study may show three-dimensional visualization value spinal surgeon , positively affect patient outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The biplanar low-dose EOS system associate sterEOS workstation ( EOSÂ® , EOS Imaging , Paris , France ) allow 3D spine reconstruction . The EOS system present advantage MRI CT Scans . The weight bear position allow assessment functional position radiation exposure 800-1000 time less CT scan , allow full spine acquisition even pediatric patient . Selected anatomical landmark utilized reconstruct 3D model spine allow global assessment well localize analysis.The aim study assess clinical relevance 3D stereographic reconstruction ( sterEOS 3D ) patient , adult child , undergo spine surgery . This study observe value 3D parameter three different step standard care surgical procedure : preoperatively , peri-operatively , post-operatively . The goal prospective study observe 3D reconstruction could enhance planning , surgery post-op analysis outcomes . This pilot study could help understand 3D parameter could improve adult pediatric spine surgery .</detailed_description>
