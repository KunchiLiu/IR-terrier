	<brief_summary>Arthroplastic hip surgery `` fast-track '' subject increase interest reduces average length stay improve patient satisfaction . This fast circuit implement many school us dedicated inpatient unit , preoperative patient education multidisciplinary group ( include physiotherapist , nurse , rehabilitation doctor surgeon ) , analgesia protocol multimodal network dedicate outlet ( 1.2 ) . The investigator work hypothesis mere realization preoperative visit week intervention would reduce average length stay patient target two night ( instead 7.5 day currently ) ( 3 ) reduce use SSR hospitalization . This consultation would serve explain patient early course care , give advice help anticipate act release `` post-operative '' , example , contact physical therapist nurse check community pharmacy heparin stock enough answer question ( Appendix 2 : early information give patient consultation J-8 ) . The investigator protocol inspired one already place outpatient PTH PTH 1 night invariably apply patient home consider output .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2 . Objectives 1 . Primary Objective Influence preoperative consultation `` D-8 '' average length stay randomized series multi-operator . 2 . Secondary objective 1 . Evaluation patient satisfaction clinical status 2 . Evaluation analgesic consumption 3 . Evaluation complication 3 . Population concern 1 . Inclusion Criteria All patient undergo total hip replacement 2 . Exclusion criterion 1 . Patient choose immediately support SSR postoperative 2 . Geographical remoteness 3 . Social isolation 4 . Medical pathology require special monitoring ( phlebitis history , coagulation disorder , anticoagulant therapy ... ) 5. psychiatric pathology 6 . Patients opt protocol `` overnight '' 4 . Methodology duration research This prospective mono-centric multi-operator assessment management patient surgical practice refer . The inclusion patient take place period 12 month , goal include 90 patient ( Figure 1 ) . Justification Sample Size In 2013 , patient operate planned way , degenerative osteoarthritis , length stay 7.5 day standard deviation 3 day . With length stay , staff 2 45 subject detect difference length stay least 1.8 day ( significance level 5 % , 80 % power ) . Such difference reasonably possible propose organizational intervention . Early preoperative consultation propose randomized patient . When patient include group study , present preoperative consultation early information document advice guidance patient anticipate act provide release `` post-operative '' ( cf . . Appendix 2 : patient information deliver early consultation J-8 ) . This consultation educate patient happen leave , specify concretely articulation city various professional involve planned respond issue raise . Data collection Clinical data collect anonymously internal orthopedic surgery service patient include study realization Oxford hip score intervention ( J-1 ) , assessment pain verbal validate scale ( VAS ) , St Joseph satisfaction questionnaire ( validated questionnaire Saphora ) accompany verbal scale patient discharge telephone call 30 day surgery achieve Oxford hip score , evaluation pain VAS patient satisfaction simple verbal scale ( see Annex 1 ) ( 4 ) . The criterion hospital discharge : - Clinically : clean dressing , fever , comorbidity decompensation , EVA &lt; 4 analgesic . - Biologically : Hemoglobin &gt; 10 . - Functionally : 3 step climb ability , ability walk twenty meter go bathroom alone . The assessment criterion use : Primary endpoint : - Average length stay Criterion secondary judgment : - Score Oxford Hip intervention - Patient satisfaction ( verbal scale : 0 10 ) intervention - St. Joseph Satisfaction Questionnaire ( validate questionnaire Saphora ) - Evaluation pain VAS intervention - Morbidity mortality randomization : Randomization 2 group ( usual care without consultation J-8 versus consultation J-8 ) carry patient . The patient list balance randomly alternate block . orthopedic service personnel notify advance schedule avoid bias management patient service . Data processing : For subject award identifier ( original name surname - year birth ) data enter computer file send statistician charge analyze GHPSJ site . There exchange personal data . Statistical analysis : To find test difference , univariate analyzes use test t-Student continuous variable chi 2 categorical variable nonparametric equivalent . The significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . If imbalance group , multivariate model develop</detailed_description>
