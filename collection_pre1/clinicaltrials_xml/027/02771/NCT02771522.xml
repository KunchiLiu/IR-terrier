	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-centre clinical study monitor caries lesion activity orthodontic patient Calcivis System 12 week period . Dentists identify patient dental appliance place minimum 12 month visible white spot lesion anterior surface incisor / canine de-bond . Following de-bond , image tooth surface take Calcivis System . Presence absence elevate luminescence image indicate activity / inactivity . Only patient least one tooth identify active Calcivis System continue study follow 2 , 4 , 8 12 week de-bond . Images active teeth take Calcivis System , follow-up visit . The percentage teeth show luminescence use Calcivis System calculate summarised subject post-baseline visit , additionally Investigator ICDAS score Visit 1 . For subject percentage teeth ICDAS score calculate . This summarised subject post-baseline visit ICDAS score also cross-tabulated presence/absence luminescence individual teeth visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caries Lesion Activity Orthodontic Patients - Calcivis System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental caries ( tooth decay ) significant clinical public health problem . The development caries lesions involve net mineral loss dental tissue , lead progressive loss tooth structure associate pain disease . Detecting , assess , diagnosis treat lesion core activity dentistry . Currently main detection diagnosis aid visual inspection use probe , together X-ray image . Determination activity status lesion ( likely progress ) require assess treatment need . Currently methods problematic involve clinician ' subjective assessment / monitoring lesion progression number visit . It generally recognise report dental literature patient undergoing orthodontic treatment fix appliance find difficult maintain meticulous oral hygiene , result , plaque accumulates adjacent orthodontic bracket ( usually place buccal , Free Smooth , surface teeth , readily visible ) hold metal wire involve move teeth - thus white spot lesion commonly develop site plaque stagnation . These lesion , de facto , actively develop orthodontic treatment , thus represent 'active lesion ' . Once wire bracket remove post-treatment , normal oral hygiene resume , plaque/biofilm lesion readily remove become arrest , i.e . demineralisation process cease . Thus short period time - matter week - usually transition active inactive status 'orthodontically-induced ' white spot lesion . By assess monitoring lesion , use Calcivis device , relatively short interval period lesion status transition immediately post orthodontic treatment would possible monitor reduction demineralisation process lesion arrest . A previous clinical study prototype Calcivis System conduct . The result conclude Calcivis System safe use level agreement elevate luminescence area expect activity 70 % due chance ( NCT02098304 ) . This prospective , single-centre clinical study design assess use Calcivis System monitor activity level post-orthodontic treatment white spot lesion time . The Dentist share image patient The device evaluation comprise hand-held customized intra-oral camera take image lesion tooth surface immediately application disclose solution contains bioluminescent photo-protein . The photo-protein detects free calcium ion tooth surface produce light signal caries lesion active . For study , patient attend routine Orthodontic appointment appliance check , identify Investigator meet Inclusion Exclusion criterion , ready de-bond , approach discus possible participation study . Patients give Patient Information Sheet read time consider participation study . If happy participate ask attend five Study Visits - de-bond ( baseline ) , 2 , 4 , 8 12 week . Written inform consent take study procedure conduct . As child age 16 include study , parent / guardian consent take appropriate . At study Visit 1 , demographic , relevant medication , oral hygiene orthodontic history data collect . The orthodontist carry oral examination tooth / teeth identify per inclusion / exclusion criterion , clean prophy paste , rinse tap water 3-in-1 air / water spray air dry stag per ICDAS cod . Reference intra-oral photograph take tooth . The free smooth tooth surface air dry image Calcivis System , immediately application disclose solution . After image complete , patient rinse tap water . Adverse event collect throughout . The dentist share image teeth patient . Post imaging questionnaire complete patient end Study Visit 1 user questionnaire complete dental team end Study Visit 1 day . Only patient 'active ' lesion de-bond , confirm Calcivis System baseline visit , follow study . If lesion assess 'inactive ' , patient withdrawn study Eligible patient return Study Visits 2 , 4 , 8 12 week post-de-bond . At visit , follow reference photograph teeth , tooth `` active '' Study Visit 1 image Calcivis System describe image share patient . In addition , Patient User Questionnaires complete final Study Visit 12 week .</detailed_description>
