	<detailed_description>STUDY AIMS : AIM 1 . To identify barrier implement integrated cardiovascular risk management program family individual positive history CHD . AIM 2 . To assess effectiveness integrated cardiovascular risk management strategy ( consist screen risk factor , lifestyle education linkage primary care cardiovascular risk factor management ) risk factor cluster family , change blood pressure ( BP ) , lipid , glucose , smoke physical activity . AIM 3 . To estimate scalability integrate cardiovascular risk reduction strategy family individual positive history CHD state- nation-wide implementation . Scalability inform cost-effectiveness acceptability integrate cardiovascular risk reduction approach . STUDY DESIGN : The propose project use mixed method achieve study aim , three design approach include : Aim 1 , formative qualitative research ; Aim 2 , randomize controlled trial ; Aim 3 , cost effectiveness evaluative qualitative research . Additionally pilot study conduct aim understand practical feasibility study , acceptability among participant , appropriateness study tool finally explore interest stakeholder ( community health worker department health service , Government Kerala ) . The pilot study include 30 participant . It essentially check validity response elicit tool . We also plan conduct two focus group discussion potential participant ( individual family history CHD ) . Additionally , 6 in-depth interview conduct community health worker ( convenient sampling ) ass opinion intervention programme . Formative qualitative research ( Aim 1 ) : Semi-structured focus group discussion ( FGDs ) 6-12 adult family history CHD gather information understanding disease , barrier care , feedback intervention ( lifestyle education , care linkage coordination ) . In-depth interview stake-holders ( frontline community health care worker ( FCHW ) , primary care physician , general practitioner ) face-to-face semi-structured include question regard integration cardiovascular risk management family level . The intervention trial protocol modify incorporate key finding collect FGDs interview make intervention contextually-relevant . Integrated cardiovascular risk reduction intervention ( Aim 2 ) : A randomized control trial family individual positive history CHD use address Aim 2 . Eligibility criterion : Eligible family include least one family member physician confirm CHD diagnose age 55 year . If family member die CHD ( physician confirm death ) age 55 year , family also eligible participate study . The medical record CHD patient use confirm diagnosis age index case . A write informed consent study randomization plan head family mandatory eligibility criterion . All participate family member also require provide individual consent participate . Family randomization : Each family randomly assign participate either treatment intervention arm ( integrated CVD risk management ) usual care arm ( intervention initial screen ) . Participants eligibility criterion : Minimum two member family include even reside separate house . Potential participant must either parent , child brother sister affect person ( individual history CHD ) order enter study 18 year age . Bedridden terminally ill patient exclude study . To address Aim 2 , several clinical outcome assess . Primary outcome : proportion group achieve improve risk factor control status ( blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg , fast blood glucose ( FPG ) &lt; 110 mg/dl , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) &lt; 100 mg/dl , abstinence smoking/tobacco use : least 3 4 risk factor ) . Secondary outcome : 1. group difference number optimal CV health indicator ( BP &lt; 120/80 mmHg , TC &lt; 200 mg/dl , FPG &lt; 100 mg/dl , &gt; 150 min/week moderate intensity physical activity , BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 , never use tobacco quit &gt; 6 month ago healthy diet score ) , 2. group mean difference main risk factor ( SBP , DBP , LDL , FPG ) , 3. proportion meet &gt; 80 % recommended process measure ( smoke cessation , moderate high intensity physical activity , &lt; 5g per person/day salt consumption , &gt; 3 daily serving fruit vegetable ) , 4 ) proportion achieve maintain ten year Framingham CVD risk score15/WHO CVD risk score &lt; 10 % INTERHEART non-laboratory base score &lt; 5 . Study Intervention Overview : Usual care arm : The usual care arm screen CVD risk factor . Screening result plus one time education regard management risk factor provide family member . Patients hypertension , diabetes dyslipidemia control arm also refer primary health care facility . Treatment arm : The study intervention design leverage exist health care infrastructure available community level . Trained FCHW visit family promote lifestyle intervention strategy least two month intervention phase . The intervention consist three phase : 1 ) screen detection CV risk factor , 2 ) lifestyle ( nutritional/physical activity education tobacco cessation ) counsel 2 ) FCHW assist linkage primary care 3 ) active follow-up mobile phone application . Intervention Part 1 . Screening CV risk factor ( CONTROL AND TREATMENT ARMS ) : All eligible adult select family undergo screen procedure CVD risk factor . The family randomize either treatment control arm . At start intervention program , high risk patient usual care arm refer exist primary care system management . Intervention Part 2 . Lifestyle Education ( TREATMENT ARM ) : Lifestyle education intervention : The lifestyle education component treatment arm include minimum 9 nutritional/tobacco/physical activity consultation . All study participant within select family treatment arm participate lifestyle education component . Within 30 day study enrollment , participant complete culturally specific food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) tobacco use survey . FCHW receive training study staff prior study implementation . Recommended diet modification participant focus maintain healthy weight via redistribution/reduction calorie ( avoid fry food sugar-sweetened beverage ) , increase fiber protein intake via wheat , sprout pulse , reduce glycaemic load switching refine white rice bread whole wheat , increase fruit vegetable consumption , reduce salt sugar intake . Tobacco cessation strategy change sedentary behaviour also discuss education meeting . Current tobacco user complete culturally appropriate cessation action guide identify trigger action step promote tobacco-free behaviour . Family consultation repeat every two month re-assess dietary tobacco use change . FCHW worker conduct peer-support group education meeting group 10 participant every two month . Support group meeting review diet modification tobacco cessation recommendation highlight peer ' strategy lead successful improvement diet . All individual elevate risk factor CVD invite participate least 3 peer-support group education period trial . Intervention Part 3 . Linkage primary care ( TREATMENT ARM ) : All high risk patient treatment arm link appropriate primary care clinic assistance FCHW . FCHW worker assist high risk patient identify primary secondary care facility help schedule initial appointment . For 24 consecutive month follow initial screen randomization , participant intervention arm receive quarterly phone interview measure primary care clinic utilization ass cardiovascular risk factor management activity ( lipid examine , smoke cessation program , hypertension control , glucose monitoring ) . Care coordination follow-up : Each family , treatment arm assign FCHW . During intervention phase FCHW worker meet study patient two month ass study progress participation initial six month . During intermediate-term follow-up ( month 7-24 ) FCHW maintain three month contact family . In addition , questionnaire data collection blood draw home visit study month 12 24 help ass detail attribute cardiovascular management ( FBG , BP , LDL measure ) . An incentivized ( free SMS credit ) didactic mobile phone SMS platform use enhance follow-up . Via SMS , patient receive study visit reminder brief survey . Cost effectiveness acceptability analysis ( Aim 3 ) : The intervention cost include resource input ( e.g. , personnel salary , material ) require deliver intervention ( total per participant ) . Direct indirect cost incur family estimate use questionnaire . Questionnaires ( administer study visit 0 , 12 24 ) capture direct medical cost , direct non-medical cost ( travel ) , indirect cost ( miss work time , lose productivity ) . To estimate cost-effectiveness ( cost per one count decrease cluster risk factor ) , trial group difference intervention delivery patient direct cost divide group difference cluster risk factor cardiovascular risk score : [ cost treatment arm - cost standard arm ] / [ ΣΔPrimary outcome-Treatment arm ] - [ ΣΔPrimary outcome-usual care arm ] . Similarly , incremental cost utility ratio calculate use data 12 monthly health utility assessment . Quality adjust life year ( QALY ) use measure health utility . The acceptability intervention assess qualitative research . Semi-structured FGDs ( 6 men woman ) conduct among study participant end intervention period . In-depth interview FCHW ( 6 interview ) also conduct gauge acceptability intervention .</detailed_description>
