	<brief_summary>`` Brain signature '' objective measure acute pain characterized functional magnetic resonance image machine learn technology . As compare acute pain , chronic pain lead great socioeconomic burden . However , measure chronic pain remain subjective suboptimal , brain signature chronic pain largely unknown . Chronic migraine fibromyalgia two prototype primary chronic pain disorder high disability intractability prevalence around 2 % disease . These two chronic pain disorder share clinical presentation ( abnormal pain sensitivity , mood sleep disorder ) , pathophysiology ( central sensitization ) medical treatment ( anti-depressants ) , despite different body part involve ( head vs. whole body ) . The present integrated project aim characterize common disease-specific brain signature chronic pain investigate two chronic pain disorder . Our finding may shed light key mechanism pain chronification , may pave way optimization diagnosis prognostication , well formulation personalize medicine chronic pain , improve life quality patient reduce socioeconomic loss . The present project include three interdisciplinary sub-projects ( plus one animal study , list ) : A : Clinical study chronic migraine fibromyalgia : endophenotypes pain chronification B : Functional neuroimaging chronic pain : multimodal quantitative analysis brain connectomes C. Data stream mining technology multimodal physiological signal chronic pain : real-time track clinical correlation The specific aim present project include : 1 . Identification common disease-specific brain signature chronic pain ( sub-projects A , B , C ) 2 . Investigation clinical indicator predictive value machine learn analysis big data ( sub-projects A , B , C ) 3 . Elucidation specific anatomical structure neural network underpin pain chronification base clinical neuroimaging ( sub-projects A , B ) In 1st-year pilot study 4-year longitudinal study , establish experimental platform sub-project , start recruit participant perform endophenotyping , well preliminary integration sub-projects A , B C .</brief_summary>
