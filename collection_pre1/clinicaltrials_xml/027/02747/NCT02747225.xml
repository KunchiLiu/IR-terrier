	<brief_summary>Previously publish study indicate exist difference electrical property ( EPs ) , i.e. , conductivity relative permittivity , malignant adjacent normal tissue , useful early detection cancer . However EP information mainly base ex vivo measurement cancer tissue , data vivo publish . The purpose study vivo measure electrical property malignant tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The measurement safety guarantee conducted cancer surgery . Before tissue excise patient , pathologist assist operator ( already operate room ) responsible measurement.The measurement malignant correspond normal tissue perform . The tissue dielectric property measurement classify normal malignant pathologist base expertise decision criterion ( visual inspection , anatomy ) per-operative histological examination . The measurement directly perform tissue excision.The site measure malignant tissue mark , doubletracked accord pathological report make sure mark site malignant . The patient age tissue temperature time measurement record .</detailed_description>
