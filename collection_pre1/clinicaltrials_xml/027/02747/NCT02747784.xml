	<brief_title>Evaluation Assess Cognitive Training Prevention Post-operative Cognitive Decline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The REACT trial design feasibility study investigate impact pre- , peri- , postoperative computerize cognitive training incidence postoperative cognitive dysfunction . Two different study group ( train program ) compare . Each group consist two training module validate computer base train program cognitive functioning call RehaCom® . The experimental group consist modules 'Topological Memory ( MEMO ) ' 'Divided Attention 2 ( GEA2 ) ' . The active comparator group consist modules 'Topological Memory ( MEMO ) ' 'Working memory ( WOME ) ' . 48 surgical patient undergo elective urogynecological surgery preoperatively randomly assign one two study group . Before start training , patient complete neuropsychological test battery comprise cognitive test measure POCD . The test assess preoperative baseline visit 3-months follow-up . In order correct change cognitive performance practice effect , group 24 female surgical control subject also prospectively test cognitive test battery baseline 3-months follow-up . The control subject match 2 study group regard health Status , surgery age , neither undergo computerized cognitive training program RehaCom® . Further , 24 female control subject include POCD-Register ( EA1/104/16 ) match 2 study group well . After baseline assessment , study group patient teach use training program RehaCom® , train start preoperatively early possible . The patient recommend perform training daily inpatient hospital stay , least three time week 30 60 minute month 3 . The neuropsychological assessment perform preoperative baseline three-months follow-up . Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) classify use dichotomous approach establish Rasmussen et al International Study postoperative cognitive deficit ( ISPOCD ) ( Rasmussen et al . The assessment postoperative cognitive function . Acta Anaesthesiol Scand . 2001 Mar ; 45 ( 3 ) :275-89 . ) This calculation method defines POCD reliable change pre- postoperative cognitive performance ( difference score ) individual surgical patient cohort compare change non-surgical control group ( reliable change index either composite score include cognitive test parameter test cognitive test battery least two chosen cognitive test parameter ) . Secondary outcome measure trial comprise structural functional MRI measure , Electroencephalogram simultaneous fMRI , intraoperative cerebral oximetry neuromonitoring , delirium , pain , sleep quality , postoperative complication , frailty , psychological distress , quality life , train performance evaluation training .</detailed_description>
