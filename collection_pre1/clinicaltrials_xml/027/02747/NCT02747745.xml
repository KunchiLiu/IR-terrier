	<brief_summary>The grow number person dementia ( PWDs ) call policy change service innovation . Recent case management ( CM ) research recognize positive impact family caregiver ( FCGs ) PWDs . However , research gap identify , include paucity theoretical base CM practice lack mediator effect . Therefore , original purpose five-year project implement theoretical-based randomize control CM intervention FCGs early moderate PWDs home base stress model tailor need prioritized FCGs . This project fund Minister Scientific Technology first two year accomplish first two aim : 1 . First year : develop test psychometric property relate instrument protocol ( cross-sectional study ) ; 2 . Second year : conduct feasibility test CM intervention ( pilot RCT ) . The purpose current project achieve aim 3 ( three year ) : implement 4-month CM intervention ( main RCT ) . In total , 2 home visit , 2 phone call dyad , receive telephone call FCGs work hour . Investigator collect 4-time point data T0 base line data , T1 ( recruitment , 4 th month , first follow ) , T2 ( recruitment , 6th month , second follow ) T3 ( recruitment,12 th month ) . Investigator recruit 76 dyad three year ( 38 dyad group ) ( n = 152 total ) . The primary outcome FCG QoL PWD behavioral problem , secondary outcome percentage PWD status ( i.g . nursing home admission ) frequency PWD acute hospitalization . Investigator also test mediator effect FCG self efficacy use statistical analysis method Hierarchical Linear Modeling ( HLM ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary care physicians memory disorder clinic participate hospital ( Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital Lin-Kuo , Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital-Taoyuan branch , Catholic Mercy Hospital Hukou , Hsinchu county ) receive write letter explain purpose project eligible criterion PWDs FCGs . Debriefing provide upon request . Then participate physician help identify eligible dyad ; one train research assistant ( RA ) responsible CM implementation ( RA I ) , second RA ( graduate student , RA II ) responsible data collection time point . To increase feasibility project , inclusion criterion PWDs make reflect recruiting site reality , include : ( 1 ) age old 60 year old ; ( 2 ) primary FCG secondary FCG provide sufficient information assistant PWD ; co-residence require ; ( 3 ) PWDs cognitive impairment confirm primary secondary FCG participate neurologist . The exclusion criterion PWDs include : ( 1 ) acute illness , impaired sensory symptom ( hear loss severe visual problem ) ; ( 2 ) acute agitation require emergency treatment ; ( 3 ) chronic alcohol abuse use drug possibly affect central nervous system function ; ( 4 ) presence major psychiatric disorder within last 2 year ; ( 5 ) neurological systemic illness ( e.g . delirium , hypoxia , unstable thyroid dysfunction ) ; ( 6 ) primary FCG secondary FCG . Investigator screen FCGs report meet criterion moderate level severity follow risk area ( Table 1 ) : depressive symptom , burden , distress problematic behavior PWDs healthy behavior . The definition primary FCG include : ( 1 ) age 18 year old great ; ( 2 ) least provide assistance ( 4 hour day ) relatives dementia past three month conduct secondary care relative , mean FCGs supervise hire care assistant foreign helper actually take care patient ; co-residency require family caregiver . Exclusion criterion family caregiver include : ( 1 ) document cognitive mental disorder , severe memory problem major affective disorder ; ( 2 ) hear visual impairment properly correct ; ( 3 ) prescribe drug know impair enhance attention , e.g. , antidepressant , barbiturate , depressant , amphetamine ; ( 4 ) insufficient command Mandarin , Taiwanese ; ( 5 ) participation intervention may contaminate result study . In previous project , satisfactory level case management training course high . All trainee high regard toward professional quality content instructor ( Chiu et al , 2013 ) . One case manager serve research assistant previous project continue work u interventionist upon funded . Investigator conduct three-year RCT involve repeat measure four time point : baseline screening ( T0 ) , 4th month ( end intervention , T1 ) , 6th month ( post-treatment follow , T2 ) , 12th month ( T3 ) . Randomization Randomization take place baseline assessment . An external independent person establishes random order use random number table . CM Intervention Protocol The 4-month CM intervention FCGs PWDs involve 2 home visit , 2 phone call case manager dyad , receive telephone call FCGs work hour ( Monday Friday , 9-5 ) . The case manager target prioritize risk 4 risk area FCG problem : depressive symptom , burden , distress problematic behavior PWDs , healthy behavior ( Table 1 ) . The intervention mainly consist 1. need assessment nursing education home environment modification safety , behavioral management communication skill ( Belle et al. , 2006 ) ; 2. home-based cognitive stimulation PWD simple mathematical practice ( Cheng et al. , 2013 ) , patient preferred leisure activity ( Chiu et al. , 2015 ) reminiscence old time photo , story toy ( Chiu et al. , 2013 ) ; 3. brief consultation 4 risk area relate FCG stress ( Belle et al. , 2006 ) 4. case management refer dyads hospital-based dementia center community resource ( Chien et al. , 2010 ) . The case manager ass recruit dyad begin intervention ( T0 ) , develop tailor care plan base prioritized risk area FCGs conduct first home visit 1st month build partnership FCGs , discus care plan FCGs ( PWDs possible ) . Each risk area FCG dealt CM component education , brief counseling , problem solve evidence base strategy derive Pearlin 's theoretical principle . The case manager teach FCGs implement home-based cognitive stimulation cognitive training PWDs provide daily log record activity leisure-time physical activity well medical cost . There two telephone call 2nd 3rd month reinforce dyad teach strategy , collect log data remind date next home visit ( 4th month ) . If problem risk area persist first phone call , case manager discus case multidisciplinary conference participate dementia center nurse , social worker , clinical psychologist neurologist . Then revise care plan develop additional home visit conduct 3rd month . If necessary , case manager refer dyads hospital-based dementia center , memory clinic governmental resource . The frequent contact ensure CM strategy reflect change need FCGs . The definition compliance 80 % CM strategy complete dyad . The outcome data collect recruitment 4th month ( T1 ) , 6th month ( T2 ) 12th moth ( T3 ) either home visit dementia center memory clinic visit . To ensure quality medical care , group participant follow three monthly interval dementia center . PWDs experimental control group receive standard medical treatment clinically indicate . For control group , initial assessment , case manager give dyad write information dementia progress well home safety first home visit . Then case manager make 2 phone call 2nd 3rt month social interaction control group collect cost data . These phone call involve active education , consultation cognitive stimulation training . The control dyads remain usual care , i.e. , visit primary care physicians special neurologist treatment related consultation well education . The participate physician unaware dyad allocation either intervention control condition . The dyad control group access structure tailored activity . The outcome data collect 4th month ( T1 ) , 6th month ( T2 ) 12th month ( T3 )</detailed_description>
