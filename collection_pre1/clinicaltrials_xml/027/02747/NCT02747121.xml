	<brief_title>Effects External Inspection Sepsis Detection Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study assess effect external inspection quality care provide sepsis patient admit hospital explore external inspection affect involve organization . External inspection widely use mean improve quality care , core element regulatory regime certification accreditation process . The activity assess health care organization 's performance accord externally define standard describe partly overlap term external inspection , external review , supervision , audit . The project use term external inspection imply inspection initiate controlled organization external one inspect ; define : `` system , process arrangement dimension characteristic healthcare provider organisation activity assess analysed framework idea , knowledge , measure derive developed outside organisation '' . In line definition investigator intend study external inspection affect quality care provide organizational level . The project intend study external inspection affect individual organization individual professional development . The investigator take perspective quality care consider system property , dependent organization provide care performs whole . Accordingly , improve quality care dependent change performance organization , turn implies change organizational behavior way clinician mutually interact perform clinical process . Change organizational behavior complex social process involve number different practice different organizational level . If external inspection ability contribute improve quality care organizational level , need affect practice involve organizational change . The effect external inspection system quality care remain unclear evidence contradictory . Studies demonstrate positive association accreditation ability promote change , professional development , quality system , clinical leadership . There evidence support association inspection different quality outcome e.g . reduce incidence pressure ulcer suicide . There however also study report inspection impact quality care . Inspection system widely use much resource spend system worldwide . More knowledge whether external inspection effect quality care need . The inspection process consider complex intervention consist set activity introduce vary organizational context . The inspection direct impact quality care . If inspection encounter non-compliant behavior , inspected organization responsible implement necessary change . The way inspection process affect involve organization thus influence inspected organization pursue follow change process . The way external inspection affect involve organization , currently poorly understood . A good understanding underlying mechanisms inspection system might contribute improve quality care need . Such knowledge improve understanding effect external inspection seem vary , turn facilitate development effective way conduct inspection . The study use external inspection sepsis detection treatment hospital case explore inspection affect involve organization evaluate effect quality care . Sepsis prevalent disease one main cause death among hospitalized patient internationally Norway . Former external inspection Norwegian hospital show insufficient governance clinical process emergency room could severe consequence patient admit hospital undiagnosed sepsis . During recent year , Norwegian Board Health Supervision investigate number case hospital provide care line recommend guideline sepsis treatment . On background , Norwegian Board Health Supervision decide conduct nationwide inspection campaign sepsis detection treatment acute hospital 2016-2017 . Early treatment antibiotic along compliance treatment guideline associate reduced mortality sepsis patient . International study show compliance treatment guideline varies , improve compliance improve patient outcome . External inspection identify sub-optimal compliance treatment guideline . Improved compliance treatment guideline dependent change organizational practice . Such change organizational practice measure use process indicator indicative sensitive change key area identify inspection . The study use process measure ass external inspection affect guideline adherence . Because improved guideline adherence demonstrate improve quality care term reduce mortality , argue expedient case evaluate external inspection affect quality care .</detailed_description>
