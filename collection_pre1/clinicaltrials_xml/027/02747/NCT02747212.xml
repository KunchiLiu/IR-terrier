	<brief_summary>Previously publish study indicate exist difference electrical property ( EPs ) , i.e. , conductivity relative permittivity , malignant adjacent normal tissue , useful early detection cancer . While EP information cancer tissue sufficient enough . The purpose study measure electrical property excise malignant tissue obtain cancer surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Electrical Properties Malignant Tissues Ex Vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measurement conduct operating room hospital tissue excise . Once tissue excise patient , pathologist assist one engineer ( already hospital ) responsible conduct measurement . The specimen design permit least one measurement malignant tissue least one measurement normal tissue . Occasionally , measurement normal tissue possible , example , normal tissue occupy volume small proportion every excised specimen . The specimen dielectric property measurement classify normal malignant pathologist base expertise decision criterion ( visual inspection , anatomy ) per-operative histological examination . The measurement directly perform bulk specimen . The patient age , tissue temperature time measurement time excision measurement sample record .</detailed_description>
