	<brief_summary>This study propose treat patient combination sorafenib irinotecan . Patients relapse , recurrent , refractory , high risk malignancy whose tumor possess non-synonymous mutation Raf , PDGFR , VEGFR , Flt-3 , KIT , JAK , STAT , RAS , MEK , ERK eligible study . Very phase 2 clinical trial perform pediatrics use targeted agent combination conventional chemotherapy agent . Furthermore , since combination combination study ( sorafenib irinotecan ) show additive/synergistic effect preclinical study , therapy select patient possess mutation target TKI study , may unveil activity previously observe . Thus , investigator hope determine whether addition additive/synergistic chemotherapy increase efficacy target agent and/or increase tumor susceptibility target agent , result increased anti-tumor activity .</brief_summary>

Pathologic confirmation diagnosis either original diagnosis recurrence . Known nonsynonymous mutation follow gene : Raf , PDGFR , VEGFR , Flt3 , KIT , JAK , STAT , RAS , MEK , ERK . Genomic sample preferably relapse , may stage treatment relapse sample reasonably obtainable . Genetic analysis determination eligibility occur part routine care perform specifically purpose study . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT MRI scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam . Prior Therapy Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Patients must receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 2 week enrollment onto study ( 6 week prior nitrosourea ) . Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 14 day must elapse receive pegfilgrastim least 7 day must elapse since completion therapy nonpegylated growth factor . Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day must elapse since completion therapy biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period prior enrollment must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . Monoclonal antibody : At least 3 halflives must elapse since prior therapy include monoclonal antibody . ( See post halflives commonly use monoclonal antibody DVL homepage ; http : //members.childrensoncologygroup.org/Disc/devtherapeutics/default.asp . ) Radiotherapy : ≥ 2 week must elapse since local palliative XRT ( small port ) ; ≥ 6 week must elapse since treatment therapeutic dos MIBG ; ≥ 3 month must elapse prior craniospinal XRT receive , ≥ 50 % pelvis irradiate , TBI receive ; ≥ 6 week must elapse substantial bone marrow irradiation give . Stem Cell Transplant Rescue without TBI : No evidence active graft vs. host disease ≥ 2 month must elapse since transplant . Patients must performance status correspond Karnofsky Lansky great equal 50 % . Use Karnofsky patient &gt; 16 year age Lansky patient ≤ 16 year age . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcl Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcl ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion within 7 day period prior enrollment ) Total bilirubin ≤ IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Note : For purpose trial ULN ALT define 45 U/L . Adequate Renal Function Defined As : Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 serum creatinine base age/gender follow : 2 &lt; 6 year ( male=0.8 , female=0.8 ) , 6 &lt; 10 year ( male=1 , female=1 ) , 10 &lt; 13 year ( male=1.2 , female=1.2 ) , 13 &lt; 16 year ( male=1.5 , female=1.4 ) , ≥ 16 year ( male=1.7 , female=1.4 ) PTT &lt; IULN INR &lt; IULN PT &lt; IULN Normal serum lipase amylase ( per institutional normal value ) . Adequate Pulmonary Function Defined As : No evidence dyspnea rest , exercise intolerance , pulse oximetry &gt; 94 % . Adequate cardiovascular functioning sorafenib , include : Shortening fraction ≥ 28 % ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 55 % , well A blood pressure ( BP ) ≤ 95th percentile age , height , gender receive medication treatment hypertension . Normal electrocardiogram QTc &lt; 450 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Patients receive cumulative doxorubicin equivalent &gt; 375mg/m^2 total lifetime dose . Surgery Criteria : Patients plan follow invasive procedure eligible : Major surgical procedure , laparoscopic procedure , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 14 day prior initiation protocol therapy . There anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Central line placement subcutaneous port placement consider major surgery . External central line must place least 3 day prior initiation protocol therapy subcutaneous port must place least 7 prior initiation protocol therapy Patients must therapeutic anticoagulation . Prophylactic anticoagulation ( i.e . low dose warfarin ) venous arterial device allow provided requirement PT , INR , PTT meet . Patients evidence bleed diathesis eligible . Patients know Gilbert syndrome eligible . A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Currently receive investigational agent . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition sorafenib irinotecan . Currently follow concomitant medication substances potential affect activity pharmacokinetics study drug ( ) . The use follow medication discontinue prior initiation protocol therapy avoid protocol therapy reasonable alternative exist . Sorafenib Irinotecan Corticosteroids : Patients require corticosteroid stable decrease dose corticosteroid 7 day prior enrollment eligible . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac dysfunction , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , prolong QTc , interstitial lung disease , gastrointestinal perforation , hepatic impairment/failure , renal impairment/failure . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction sorafenib irinotecan . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
