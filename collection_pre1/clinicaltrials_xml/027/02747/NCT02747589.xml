	<brief_summary>In study , investigator intend evaluate use commercially available neurostimulator system , NeuroPace RNS System stimulate visual cortex . The NeuroPace RNS System proven record safety reliability approve FDA November 2013 . The RNS System indicate use patient epilepsy include skull implant neurostimulator . No modification RNS System require study . This study use device well understand effect stimulation visual part brain . The main purpose study confirm desire location implant device visual cortex , determine amount energy need elicit vision , assess nature vision produce . This information important early process design visual cortical prosthesis could eventually use commercial use .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subject blind ( i.e . bare light perception light perception eye ) . 2 . Subject history useful form vision . 3 . Subject age 1874 . 4 . Subject resides within 2 hour distance ( ground transportation ) investigational site . 5 . Subject ( ) male ( b ) female childbearing potential negative pregnancy test use reliable method contraception least two year postmenopause . 6 . Subject able complete regular office telephone appointment per protocol requirement . 7 . Subject medically fit neurosurgical intervention . 8 . Subject consider good candidate implant investigational device . 1 . Subject blind due cortical etiology ( e.g . injury visual cortex ) . 2 . Subject eligible another commercially available vision restoration therapy ( e.g . retinal prosthesis ) . 3 . Subject high risk surgical complication active systemic infection , coagulation disorder ( use antithrombotic therapy ) platelet count 100,000 . 4 . Subject history bleed immune compromise . 5 . Subject take chronic anticoagulant antiplatelet agent subject abnormally elevate preoperative coagulation profile ( either PTT PT/INR ) . 6 . Subject prior craniotomy brain surgery . 7 . Subject evidence active intracranial disease would preclude elective neurosurgical intervention , unruptured intracranial aneurysm brain tumor , aberrant visual cortex anatomy , prior stroke arteriovenous malformation . 8 . Subject significant abnormality preoperative brain MRI 9 . Subject prior history seizure epilepsy . 10 . Subject Parkinson 's disease 11 . Subject prior history serious head injury loss consciousness . 12 . Subject progressive central nervous system disease . 13 . Subject history implantrelated infection . 14 . Implantation investigational device would present unacceptable risk . 15 . Subject require likely require follow medical procedure implant NeuroPace RNS System : MR imaging , diathermy , electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . These medical procedure contraindicate patient implant RNS® System . Energy procedure send implanted brain stimulation system cause permanent brain damage may cause severe injury , coma , death . Brain damage occur list procedure even RNS® Neurostimulator turn Leads connect Neurostimulator , occur even Neurostimulator remove Leads ( part Lead ) cranial prosthesis remain . Refer Contraindications section RNS System User Manual detail . 16 . Subject implanted neurostimulation neuromodulation device head include , limited cochlear implant , deep brain stimulator , auditory brain implant . 17 . Subject clinically significant unstable medical condition include uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100 ; cardiac pulmonary disease ; uncorrected coagulation abnormality ; diabetes ; condition would render patient unable safely cooperate study test judge screen physician . 18 . Subject alcohol illicit substance use disorder within last 6 month , unstable remission substance abuse , chart evidence comorbid substance use disorder could account lack treatment response . 19 . Subject uncontrolled chronic pain . 20 . Subject significant neurocognitive impairment memory domain ( base MoCABLIND &lt; 18 WAISIV &lt; 80 , describe ) . 21 . Subject moderate severe depression , determine score least 17 HAMD . 22 . Subject suicide attempt last two year , presence suicide plan ( answer `` Yes '' Question C4 Section CSuicidality MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview ) , `` yes '' answer one ten suicidal ideation behavior question CSSRS . 23 . Subject disease condition prevents understand communication inform consent , study demand , test protocol , include : 1 . Cognitive decline include diagnosed form dementia and/or progressive neurologic disease 2 . Psychiatric disease include diagnose form depression 3 . Does speak principal language associate region 4 . Deafness selective frequency hear loss prevents adequate communication researcher . 24 . Subject pregnant planning become pregnant next year . 25 . Subject enrol another therapeutic investigational drug device trial</criteria>
