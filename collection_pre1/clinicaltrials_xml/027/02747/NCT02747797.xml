	<detailed_description>Lucitanib oral multi kinase inhibitor design block action certain molecule call `` angiogenic factor '' may cause tumor grow . These factor call vascular endothelial growth factor ( call VEGF ) , platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) fibroblast growth factor ( call FGF ) . Lucitanib experimental approve FDA treatment cancer . The purpose clinical trial study follow cancer patient whose cancer harbor aberration FGFR , VEGFR , PDGFR , biomarkers predict sensitive lucitanib : - To look effect lucitanib disease 10 mg daily . - To look biomarkers sample blood tumor tissue identify patient likely respond lucitanib . - To look safety lucitanib patient This two-center , open-label , non-randomized Phase II study lucitanib adult subject advance cancer . Treatment consist daily oral administration 10mg lucitanib 28-day cycle . All patient provide informed consent screen eligibility . Baseline assessment include vital sign , physical exam , blood hematology chemistry , ECG , ECHO . If do within prior 4 week , PET/CT scan , MRI , and/or CT scan perform radiological evaluation disease . Clinical evaluation include physical exam , vitals , ECG ( obtain every month throughout treatment ) ; blood hematology chemistry ( obtain every two week first three month every month throughout treatment ) ; radiologic evaluation ( PET/CT , CT and/or MRI , +/- bone image clinically appropriate ) perform every 8 week . This study may last approximately 4 year longer , depend whether study doctor feel continue lucitanib dose patient 's best interest . Once patient finish study treatment lucitanib , patient need complete End Study visit . Each study visit last approximately 2 8 hour .</detailed_description>

Adequately control blood pressure ( BP ) : BP ≤ 150/90 mm Hg . Use &gt; 2 antihypertensive agent enrollment allow . Adequate performance status : Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 Subjects must antitumor agent least 5 half life agent 4 week last day treatment , whichever short . Endocrine therapy ( e.g. , breast prostate cancer ) antiHer2 therapy ( example , trastuzumab , pertuzumab , lapatinib ) allow continue study . Bisphosphonates denosumab allow subject bone metastasis . Subjects may receive experimental agent agent FDA approve . Pregnant lactate woman . Uncontrolled hypertension ( define SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg optimize antihypertensive therapy ) Subjects recovered toxicity result prior anticancer therapy , except alopecia infertility . Recovery define &lt; Grade 2 severity per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 4.3 . Significant cardiovascular impairment : history CHF great New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II , unstable angina , MI stroke within 6 month first dose study drug , cardiac arrhythmia require medical treatment . Uncontrolled hypothyroidism define serum TSH high 5 mIU/mL receive appropriate thyroid hormone therapy . Bleeding thrombotic disorder use anticoagulant require therapeutic INR monitoring , e.g. , warfarin similar agent . Treatment LMWH factor X inhibitor require INR monitoring permit . Antiplatelet agent prohibit throughout study . Current treatment prohibit medication associate prolongation QT interval . Received strong inhibitor CYP2C8 CYP3A4 strong inducer CYP3A4 ≤ 7 day prior first dose lucitanib ongoing requirement medication . Received bevacizumab &lt; 3 month prior first dose lucitanib . Major surgery ( include placement central line ) within 3 week prior study plan surgery course study .
