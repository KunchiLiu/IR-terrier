	<brief_summary>Background : Previous animal model study University Pittsburgh show significant impact inhibit bladder activity increase bladder capacity neuromodulation technique , specifically tibial nerve stimulation . This translated adult clinical trial department urology . Through use commercially available subcutaneous nerve stimulator place dorsum foot , researcher able demonstrate significant increase bladder capacity delay void sensation 5 hour stimulation eight healthy subject . This prompt clinical trial approve IRB PRO13020474 currently enrol patient . The incidence night-time overactive bladder lead nocturnal enuresis ( bed wet ) common pediatric teenage population , particularly patient without daytime bladder activity symptom . When behavioral modification ( i.e . refrain night-time fluid consumption bladder irritant , bed wet alarm time void ) fails often paucity effective safe treatment option . Medications try , generally tricyclic antidepressant family carry significant side effect limit use . Aim : Researchers aim utilize technology currently study IRB PRO14080250 . Electrical stimulation apply foot via skin surface electrode minimum 1 hour bed 2 week 5 normal subject . Normal Subjects ask complete questionnaire skin irritation experience toe twitch wear newly design TENS device , return visit Dr. Stephany . The primary outcome study safety functionality New TENS unit</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study : Foot Neuromodulation Nocturnal Enuresis Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nocturnal Enuresis common difficult treat problem pediatric population significant negative impact child 's quality life . Apart medication significant side effect limit use , lack effective safe treatment option child frequent nocturnal enuresis . If foot stimulation prior bed indeed improve frequency nocturnal enuresis , may provide safe non-invasive therapeutic option . To achieve aim Dr. Tai work closely Dr. Sun Dr. Jia design develop small , inexpensive , easy-to-use stimulator foot neuromodulation , test safety usability 5 healthy subject 2-week period . . The strap design three function : 1 ) make electrical connection electrode , 2 ) secure insole electronic unit , 3 ) facilitate observation hand access top panel adjust stimulation strength .</detailed_description>

Currently daytime overactive bladder symptom , i.e . urinary frequency , urgency , daytime incontinence 1 . Patients nocturnal enuresis day time symptom exclude study . 2 . Children known neurological disorder may contribute nocturnal enuresis episodes 3 . Children adequately potty trained 4 . Children significant daytime symptom overactive bladder include frequency , urgency , daytime incontinence 5 . Children tolerate initial stimulation training session urology clinic upon enrollment 6 . Children implantable medical device pacemaker exclude study</criteria>
