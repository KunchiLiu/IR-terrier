Extensive research focus animal model FXS show targeted pharmacological agent normalize synaptic connectivity reverse cognitive behavioral deficit . This translational work lead multiple national international control trial human FXS underway . However , contrast heavy focus medication treatment , control trial empirically-validate cognitive behavioral intervention FXS . The propose study , first non-pharmacological control trial FXS , evaluate efficacy Cogmed , cognitive training program prove enhance work memory executive/frontal function variety clinical population . Demonstration effective Cogmed training FXS would represent major advance field , one may also generalize form intellectual disability . Furthermore , critical determine whether targeted pharmacological treatment accelerate learn cognitive development . Thus , validation Cogmed FXS provide paradigm testing hypothesis focus combined efficacy medication cognitive training .</brief_summary>
