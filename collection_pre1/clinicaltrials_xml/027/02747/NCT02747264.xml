	<brief_summary>The purpose Electronic Patient Self-Reporting Adverse-events : Patient Information aDvice ( eRAPID ) programme determine whether eRAPID ( online system patient self-report symptom side effect ) enhance patient care improve safe delivery cancer treatment . The investigator hypothesise patient symptom detect earlier timely admission reduction overall hospital contact . It predict staff save time record symptom side effect able focus attention clinical contact severe side effect . eRAPID cost-effective approach support patient self-management reduce hospital/General Practitioner ( GP ) /community contact . The majority research run systemic patient . This particular part research feasibility study radiotherapy ( RT ) patient test platform different patient group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>eRAPID Feasibility Pilot Study Pelvic Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>eRAPID online system patient self-report symptom side effect ( know adverse event AE ) cancer treatment . eRAPID allow AE reporting home hospital enables patient report data integrate exist Electronic Patient Records ( EPR ) allow report use routine care . In addition system capable generate alert severe AE relevant clinical team provide patient advice manage mild moderate AE . The investigator develop eRAPID system complex intervention use patient undergo pelvic RT specifically prostate , cervical , vulval , anal , endometrial rectal cancer . The investigator do : 1 . Integrating QTool questionnaire data Christie Manchester EPR ; Clinical Web Portal ( CWP ) MOSAIQ ( RT delivery system ) Leeds ; 2 . Developing tumour specific AE questionnaires treatment algorithms online reporting home ; 3 . Mapping current RT treatment pathways tumour group via semi-structured interview staff patient . The overall aim eRAPID system improve safe delivery cancer treatment , enhance patient care standardise documentation AE within clinical datasets . AIMS AND OBJECTIVES In feasibility pilot study , investigator plan test complete eRAPID RT platform include patient clinician interface . The investigator aim examine feasibility , acceptability , adherence intervention perspective cancer patient health professional explore impact patient care quality life . In addition , investigator aim determine effect size inform design recruitment target future randomise control trial . STUDY SAMPLE AND RESEARCH DESIGN Adult patient attend St James ' University Hospital Bexley Wing Christie Hospital Manchester start radical treatment RT prostate cancer chemo-RT anal , rectal , cervical , endometrial vulval cancer eligible take part study . This prospective randomised parallel group design feasibility study repeat measure mixed method . Participants randomise ( follow 1:1 randomisation strategy ) receive eRAPID intervention usual care . The investigator aim recruit maximum 168 patient study . Participants intervention arm receive training use eRAPID system report symptom side effect ( least weekly basis ) home via internet whilst receive treatment online weekly 6 week post treatment ( total 12 week ) 18 &amp; 24 week . Hospital staff able review eRAPID report use information consultation clinic , attend RT answer phone call . Alerts also send relevant clinical team severe symptom report patient . All patient complete paper-based quality life questionnaire baseline 6 , 12 24 week . STUDY MEASURES This study use several outcome compare eRAPID intervention usual care : Clinical outcome process care measure For example number hospital contact include admission , clinic appointment , phone call hospital staff change supportive medication adjuvant chemotherapy dose change ) . Patient-reported outcome : Overall quality life assess use validated questionnaire appropriate subscales ( example FACT-G 1 &amp; EORTC-QLQ-C30 2 Social function symptom scale EQ-5D 3 ) . Costs patient NHS : Resource use assess use patient questionnaire detail contact GPs/community service , hospital visit patient incur cost , others identify use resource form . Patient staff interview : Semi-structured staff , patient carer interview conduct explore experience use eRAPID intervention recommendation improvement . FINDINGS Overall finding determine value eRAPID intervention support care patient receive RT without concurrent chemotherapy primary cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult patient ( age 18 year ) attend St James ' University Hospital Christie Hospital Manchester : Diagnosed prostate cancer require radical radiotherapy treatment ( include radiotherapy +/ brachytherapy boost ) Or Diagnosed anal , rectal , cervical , endometrial vulval cancer require chemoradiotherapy . Able willing give inform consent Able read understand English Access internet home smart device Patients take part clinical trial involve completion extensive patient report outcome quality life measure Patients exhibit overt psychopathology/cognitive dysfunction</criteria>
