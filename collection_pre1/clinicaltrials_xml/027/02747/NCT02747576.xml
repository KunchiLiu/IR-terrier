	<brief_summary>Survivors pediatric medulloblastoma ( MB ) at-risk neurocognitive social deficit , include specific skill facial affect recognition ability recognize emotional expression another person . Because underlie mechanisms deficit poorly understood , investigator propose examine social-cognitive skill ( i.e . facial affect recognition ) indices brain integrity , include establish core neural network face perception MB survivor healthy control . By compare outcome survivor MB healthy control , investigator seek identify area brain help individual recognize emotion . Primary Objective : - To evaluate social cognition adolescent young adult survivor pediatric medulloblastoma . Secondary Objective : - To examine index brain integrity function association facial affect recognition survivor pediatric medulloblastoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Comprehensive social-cognitive behavioral data collect structural functional brain imaging complete attempt determine disruption brain integrity function cause prior treatment medulloblastoma directly influence social-cognition behavior survivor . These outcome compare survivor age- , gender- , race-matched healthy community control . Participants meet eligibility criterion consent undergo neurocognitive ( intelligence , attention , memory , process speed , motor , executive function , visuospatial ) social cognitive evaluation ( affect recognition , prosody , social memory , withdrawal/isolation , loneliness , social anxiety , visuospatial , executive function ) . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) complete affect identification task assess activation core face perception network . Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) obtain quantify water diffusion within white matter tract assess white matter integrity association functional outcome .</detailed_description>
