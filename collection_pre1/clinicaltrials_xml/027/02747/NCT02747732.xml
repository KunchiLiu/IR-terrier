	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor , PCI-32765 ( ibrutinib ) , combination bendamustine rituximab ( BR ) subject previously treat aggressive B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma ( aB-NHL ) include subtype diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma ( PMBCL ) , double triple hit DLBCL , transform indolent lymphoma , unclassifiable aggressive B cell lymphoma DLBCL Burkitt lymphoma . Patients CNS involvement ( primary secondary ) exclude . Ibrutinib ( IMBRUVICA® ; PCI-32765 ; JNJ-54179060 ) first-in-class , potent , orally-administered covalently-binding small molecule inhibitor Bruton 's tyrosine kinase currently FDA approve treatment relapse Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) .It constant investigation treatment B-cell malignancy . The initial approval ibrutinib receive 13 November 2013 United States Food Drug Administration treatment adult patient MCL receive least 1 prior therapy . Ibrutinib approve marketing treatment aggressive B cell lymphoma although Phase I trial set already publish . In Israel ibrutinib register treatment MCL CLL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ibrutinib Combination With Bendamustine Rituximab Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive BCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II single arm clinical trial design test efficacy ibrutinib combination BR relapse aB-NHL either third line post ASCT second third line non-transplant eligible patient . Patients refer study medical center Israel Israeli Lymphoma Working Group , treat Chaim Sheba Medical center . The study include Screening Phase , Treatment Phase , Post- treatment Follow-up Phase . Subject eligibility determine 30 day prior therapy initiation . The treatment Phase extend cycle 1 day 1 study drug discontinuation , either due progression , toxicity , due referral allo- SCT . Approximately 72 eligible subject stratify background chemotherapy treatment refractory versus relapse disease aB-NHL histology , number prior line therapy . All subject receive BR protocol ibrutinib 560mg per day . Ibrutinib administer orally daily start cycle 1 , day 1 , continuous schedule disease progression , referral allo-SCT , unacceptable toxicity whichever come first . The post-treatment Follow-up Phase begin end 6 cycle BR . Subjects discontinue reason disease progression must continue disease evaluation . The Post-treatment Follow-up Phase continue death , loss follow , consent withdrawal , study end , whichever occur first . Assessment tumor response progression conduct accordance Lugano criterion Malignant Lymphoma . The investigator evaluate sit disease radiological imaging , physical examination , procedure necessary . The primary efficacy analysis ORR base investigator assessment . At site visit , subject evaluate toxicity . Safety evaluation include adverse event monitoring , physical examination , concomitant medication usage , clinical laboratory parameter .</detailed_description>
