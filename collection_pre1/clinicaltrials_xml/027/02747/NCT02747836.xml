	<detailed_description>The overall goal project develop novel ultrasonographic method characterize subsynovial connective tissue ( SSCT ) detect difference SSCT , median nerve tendon motion evaluation diagnosis patient suspect carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . CTS usually diagnose late evolution , measure electrophysiological change median nerve function . Once change occur , surgery often effective treatment . At early stage evolution , non-surgical treatment might effective . Although ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) recently use measure change median nerve shape CTS , approach also capture late change . Thus , method detection CTS could identify pathology function structure nerve compromise could prevent significant morbidity transition permanent neuropathy . One promising opportunity present subsynovial connective tissue ( SSCT ) , surround tendon carpal tunnel . One characteristic finding surgically treat patient CTS non-inflammatory fibrosis SSCT . Some investigator suggest SSCT may cause nerve compression CTS . In previous work , investigator demonstrate difference mechanical property , motion thickness SSCT patient CTS compare normal . More recently , animal model describe structural change SSCT show precede change nerve function . The investigator demonstrate cadaver study normal SSCT image ultrasound , motion , velocity , thickness distinguish nearby tendon nerve . Here investigator propose leverage work , study ability ultrasound detect SSCT thickness motion individual without CTS . Based preliminary research , investigator formulate follow central hypothesis : An increase SSCT thickness change slide velocity SSCT respect correspond tendon indicative CTS . In addition , material property change SSCT affect median nerve motion transformation . This SSCT become fibrotic CTS , fibrosis alters normal SSCT-median nerve-tendon functional relationship .</detailed_description>
