	<brief_title>Phase I RVC With Ocriplasmin CRVO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) second common source permanent blindness Western world diabetic retinopathy . By block outflow pathway retinal circulation , visual prognosis bad short long term . Currently , treatment mostly focus treat secondary effect : macular edema neovascularization antiVEGF and/or corticosteroid intravitreal injection retinal laser photocoagulation . There however surgical treatment aim displace blood clot ; radial optic neurotomy . During surgical treatment , vitreous remove vitrectomy , radial incision make optic disc . The target incision open canal lamina cribrosa improve blood flow central retinal vein . Since outcome procedure variable inherent risk , mainly incision damage central retinal artery adjacent central vein , procedure routinely perform vitreoretinal center . Following recent development surgical stabilizer microneedle suitable retinal vein cannulation , option local intravenous administration fibrinolytic drug exist . This phase I study aims investigate feasibility safety surgical stabilizer assist retinal vein cannulation local intravenous infusion Ocriplasmin dissolve clot clog central retinal vein . Ocriplasmin small active part large plasmin molecule . Plasmin form enzymatic conversion plasminogen , process mediate tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) . The amount plasmin produce thus highly dependent amount plasminogen present nearby clot . By use Ocriplasmin , intermediate step skip clot target directly entire time infusion . By able get infusion time 10 minute , abundant clot exposure Ocriplasmin guaranteed . Inclusion offer patient present recent CRVO , vitrectomy perform augmented retinal vein cannulation infusion ocriplasmin 10 minute . Patients present recent CRVO ( &lt; 2weeks ) offer inclusion undergo vitrectomy subsequent prolong retinal vein cannulation infusion Ocirplasmin . The surgery do place microneedle one branch retinal vein border optic disc . To increase safety procedure surgical stabilizer develop . This procedure abundantly test refined multiple vivo porcine experiment medication ( Ocriplasmin ) already test fibrinolytic activity use 100-fold high dosis intravenously intra-arterially . After surgery , standard care follow comprehensive ophthalmological examination technical investigation foreseen . The primary outcome measure safety feasiblity study : technical success cannulate retinal vein inject ocriplasmin remove blood clot , number intervention-related ( surgical pharmacological ) complication , duration infusion . If necessary ; depend disease evolution , additional intervention like intravitreal antiVEGF , steroid laser photocoagulation perform .</detailed_description>
