	<brief_title>HeartLight Pulse Study : Evaluation Heart Rate Using Electronic Stethoscope Pre Placed ECG Delivery Room</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 10 % newborn ( 79K/yr United Kingdom , 13 million/yr worldwide ) require form resuscitation birth . It estimate approximately 7 million baby worldwide , especially premature group , require advanced resuscitation . The correct , structured management resuscitation 'golden ' minute birth critical prevent significant morbidity ( e.g . cerebral palsy due asphyxiation ) death . There strong evidence standardise resuscitation train algorithm significantly improve newborn outcome could reduce mortality 30 % certain healthcare institution . International newborn resuscitation guideline state `` prompt increase heart rate remain sensitive indicator resuscitation efficacy '' stethoscope primary mean assess heart rate ( HR ) . Provision accurate timely HR value essential best care outcomes achieve . Establishing HR category allow resuscitator decide HR &gt; 100 bpm ( suggest baby well resuscitation effective ) , 60-100bpm ( resuscitation require initially focus airway ) &lt; 60bpm ( require much intensive resuscitation could include CPR ) . International guideline recommend assess HR every 30 second stethoscope track change hence efficacy resuscitation . However , number study demonstrate newborn healthcare provider estimate HR category incorrectly 1 3 case , potentially result incorrect management baby . There strong evidence link need resuscitation poor neurodevelopmental outcome later childhood . Indeed , number large cohort study demonstrate even baby require initial resuscitation , need on-going care , increase risk low intelligence quotient childhood less likely paid employment go University adults . More recently electronic stethoscope ( ES ) use determine heart rate variability . Several study show ES reliably evaluate heart rate adult , one recently publish study demonstrate use neonatal patient . The advantage use ES ECG pulse oximetry fast acquisition HR ( &lt; 5 sec ) ease application , attribute beneficial delivery suite scenario . Furthermore , assessment HR auscultation ( use stethoscope ) still primary technique use many setting . ECG , establish accurate method monitoring HR , rarely used delivery room number reason include difficulty ensure adhesion skin ( baby wet/covered vernix ) skin damage premature baby cause strip electrode . Current ECG system also require 3 electrode position delay resuscitation . To improve HR assessment birth aim tackle problem variety mean . ECG routinely use delivery room resuscitation mainly due impracticality attach electrode set system . Current NICU practice place ECG electrodes onto baby 's chest . It also possible electrode place baby 's method commonly adopt NICU . Preterm baby routinely deliver plastic bags/wraps minimise heat loss . By pre-placing ECG electrodes onto back bag/wrap small conducting hole , possible place baby onto bag connect ECG electrodes routinely used clinical conducting gel . The baby could place onto time would save need stick electrode individually utilise baby 's weight establish electrode connection . This would avoid need place individually , often time consume challenge n't still well wet skin , avoid skin strip remove later . This study initially assess accuracy reliability electronic stethoscope evaluate heart rate stable patient neonatal unit compare routine ECG pulse oximetry measurement . This allow comparison pre place ECG system second phase study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All must write informed consent participant 's mother Phase 1 : Any neonate requiring NICU admission routine monitoring ECG . Phase 2 : Preterm infant â‰¤32 week gestation deliver plastic bag/wrap Phase 1 : Infants undergo comfort care ( palliative care ) . Infants deem sick , assessed clinical team caring , tolerate additional procedure . This unusual would normally include infant become unstable increased handle Phase 2 : Infants &gt; 32 week gestation Infants resuscitation unlikely instigate ( eg . know lethal condition )</criteria>
