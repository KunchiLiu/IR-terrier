	<brief_summary>This research trial study qualitative , qualitative , functional study first year measure immune system response patient brain tumor . Measuring number immune cell , whether immune cell work correctly , response 2 vaccine several time first year treatment may help find active immune system respond fight infection cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Qualitative , Qualitative , Functional Studies Over First Year Measuring Immune System Response During First Year Therapy Patients With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe quantity immune cell underlie antitumor immune response include dendritic cell , naive activate T- B-cells , regulatory T-cells , natural killer cell . II . To determine proliferative ability lymphocytes via T-cell activation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe immunologic response hepatitis A vaccine ( hepatitis B vaccine hepatitis A expose ) comparison expected/known normal response either prior ( i.e . pre-treatment ) follow chemoradiation ( i.e . post-treatment ) . II . To describe immunologic response tetanus toxoid vaccination compare expected/known normal response either prior ( i.e . pre-treatment ) follow chemoradiation ( i.e . post-treatment ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe immunologic response yearly influenza vaccination course first year therapy glioma ( time administration clinically indicate year therapy ) . II . To describe frequency viral infection glioma patient hospitalize respiratory viral season within year 1 therapy . III . To describe overall survival glioma patient enrol study describe overall survival patient change immunologic function . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 group . GROUP I : Patients receive standard care hepatitis A B vaccine , tetanus toxoid vaccine , trivalent influenza vaccine undergo standard care treatment external beam radiation therapy receive standard care temozolomide . Patients also undergo collection blood Samples monthly first 8 month bimonthly 12 month analysis via flow cytometry , carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) assay , live cell/dead cell distinction assay , determination naïve memory immune response . GROUP II : Patients undergo standard care treatment collection blood sample Group I . Patients receive hepatitis A tetanus toxoid vaccination month 9 .</detailed_description>
