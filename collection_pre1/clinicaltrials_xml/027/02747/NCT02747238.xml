	<brief_summary>The investigator believe ultrasound guide CSE technique help junior resident rotate first time labor delivery floor place accurately epidural needle midline position compare placing epidural needle via palpation anatomical landmark . This result increase ability place spinal component positive cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) spinal needle , correct midline placement epidural catheter , increase likelihood adequate symmetrical labor analgesia/anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Ultrasound Help Junior Anesthesia Residents With Placement Labor Analgesia Pregnant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidurals provide superior labor analgesia anesthesia . Unfortunately , failure epidural anesthesia analgesia frequent clinical problem . In heterogeneous cohort 2,140 surgical patient , failure rate 27 % lumbar epidural described . However , definition fail epidural broad . Different definition include insufficient analgesia catheter dislodgement conversion general anesthesia . Epidural analgesia failure may result technical difficulty , insufficiency overdose local anesthetic , epidural septum midline adhesion , placement epidural catheter intervertebral foramen anterior epidural space . In image study fail epidural , incorrect catheter placement account half failure , remain patient experienced suboptimal analgesia correctly position catheter . The incidence overall failure lower patient receive combine spinal-epidural ( CSE ) catheter versus epidural analgesia . In one study , CSE technique provide decreased failure rate labor analgesia comparable decreased failure rate surgical anesthesia , compare report failure rate epidural anesthesia . It believe positive CSF flow spinal needle confirms correct epidural needle placement epidural space also confirm epidural needle midline position . Placement epidural needle midline position minimize incorrect placement catheter one side , provide symmetrical analgesia versus unilateral analgesia . However , practice CSE epidural catheter placement relies palpation anatomical landmark always easy feel . Therefore , epidural needle maybe place `` midline '' despite positive loss resistance ( LOR ) cause negative CSF flow spinal needle incorrectly place catheter . As result , incorrect catheter placement result `` fail '' suboptimal epidural analgesia . Ultrasound recently utilize facilitate lumbar epidural spinal . The US image lumbar spine different scan plane facilitates identification landmark necessary appropriate epidural space location pregnant patient . There two acoustic window effective lumbar spine sonographic assessment : one see transverse approach , see longitudinal paramedian approach . The ultrasound single-screen method use transverse approach lumbar spine provide reliable information regard landmark require labor epidural . The correct interspace midline position identify correct placement CSE analgesia . A previous study do research team , compare `` blind '' v US guidance technique . It show significant difference term success rate complication either technique . However , study do 4 trained physician lot practice . At level training , investigator observe technique improvement US . Which investigator think might success show improvement technique , junior resident rotate first time floor . The idea see difference learn curve use US versus `` blind '' technique . Each resident control .</detailed_description>
