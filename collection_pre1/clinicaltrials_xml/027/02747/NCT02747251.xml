	<brief_title>Strengthening Exercises Shoulder Impingement ( SExSI ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SEXSI trial pragmatic , assessor participant blind , randomize , control , superiority trial , two-group parallel design . Patients subacromial impingement syndrome randomize either usual care home-based intervention consist progressive high volume resistance training addition usual care use 1:1 allocation . The primary end-point change Shoulder Pain Disability Index ( SPADI ) 16 week baseline . The overall frame trial main clinical effectiveness-part embed mechanistic part . The clinical effectiveness-part report main trial paper , include follow outcome : SPADI ( primary outcome ) , Abduction strength , External rotation strength , Abduction ROM , Pain last week , QoL-index , QoL-VAS , Global impression change PASS . Missing outcome data impute use multiple imputation base follow variable : All previous score relevant outcome , Age , Gender Allocation . A full trial protocol publish make publicly available . A constrained Linear Mixed Model ( cLMM ) apply continuous outcome Time Frame 16 week ( include primary outcome ) , compare change baseline 16 week intervention group ( IG ) control group ( CG ) . The outcome 16 week include dependent variable , treatment group ( IG CG ) main effect baseline score additional follow measurement repeat measurement . The covariance structure select base MAICE procedure . Binary outcomes report proportion correspond 95 % confidence interval , compare use Chi-squared test , Odds Ratios compute random effect logistic regression model . All analysis conduct intention treat ( ITT ) analyse , include randomized participant , regardless protocol adherence , mean participant analyse randomize . In primary trial report , collect outcomes list , state below-mentioned variable - belong mechanistic part - report secondary publication . The mechanistic part report secondary paper clear reference primary trial trial registration , hold label `` secondary analysis pragmatic randomize controlled trial '' title . The following outcome report : Outcomes regard pain sensitization ( temporal summation pain , condition pain modulation , pain pressure threshold pain catastrophizing ) report subsequent paper also plan investigate : - modifying effect pain sensitization effectiveness add-on intervention - dose-response relationship objectively monitor adherence add-on intervention change SPADI , shoulder abduction strength external rotation strength - dose-response relationship pain sensitization change SPADI , shoulder abduction strength external rotation strength , degree mediate adherence intervention . Outcomes regard scapula dyskinesia scapula dysfunction report another subsequent paper , also plan investigate modifying effect scapula dyskinesia scapula dysfunction effectiveness intervention change SPADI , abduction strength external rotation strength .</detailed_description>
