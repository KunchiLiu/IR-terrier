	<brief_summary>Leg spasticity common problem encounter large proportion patient suffer multiple sclerosis ( MS ) increase severity disease progress . It mostly affect antigravity muscle significantly complicate transfer , increase fatigue make walk difficult . Hence , leg spasticity often interfere patient ' mobility significantly influence quality life . A great number multidisciplinary rehabilitation study show significant effect numerous specific functional change patient secondary ( SP ) primary progressive ( PP ) MS review relate spasticity . The positive therapeutic effect modulate Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) method spasticity show two study , patient relapse remit clinical form remission phase disease . The effect TMS clinical measure low limb spasticity , functional inability quality life patient SPMS PPMS examine study . The objective study explore whether rTMS boost exercise therapy ( ET ) treatment bring improvement low limb spasticity ET treatment alone patient .</brief_summary>
