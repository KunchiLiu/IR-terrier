	<brief_title>Comparison Between Kinesiotaping Cold Therapy After Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) establish valuable procedure patient end-stage osteoarthritis rate elective TKA increase steadily year . Ninety percent patient report reduced pain , improve functional ability , great health relate quality life TKA . Kinesiotaping ( KT ) , type elastic tape increasingly used management pain oedema surgery 1. . Cold therapy ( CT ) also help relieve pain swell early postoperative period 2. . These two application may impact functional performance outcome patient TKA . The number study include KT rehabilitation process increase , n't study compare KT application CT TKA . The aim compare effectiveness kinesiotaping cold therapy muscle strength functional performance outcome patient TKA early postoperative period . Methods One-hundred-eleven patent TKA go randomly assign control , KT CT group ( nC=nKT=nCT=37 ) . KT group go receive KT lymphatic correction rectus femoris facilitation technique . CT group go receive CT immediately operation follow postoperative day . After surgery , patient receive standard post-operative treatment include continuous passive motion , active-assistive active range motion exercise , isometric isotonic strengthening exercise , gait train transfer training . After operation , pain intensity , active range motion knee function score [ Hospital Special Surgery ( HSS ) score ] Functional activity go evaluate use Iowa Level Assistance Scale , walk speed evaluate use Iowa Ambulation Velocity Scale . Isometric muscle strength measure quadriceps femoris hamstring muscle assess Hand-Held Dynamometer . All measurement evaluate discharge . One way ANOVA go used statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
