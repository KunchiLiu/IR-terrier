	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause long-term disability old adult United States . At six month stroke , 65 % 795,000 person experience stroke year continue motor impairment inhibit functional use weaker arm daily activity negatively impact quality life . Rehabilitation robot provide clinicians new treatment option improve movement arm function stroke . The purpose pilot study develop test therapy call `` Active Learning Program Stroke '' ( ALPS ) . We combine therapy program robot-assisted therapy home program stroke-affected arm hand .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Little known individual learn utilize robot-trained movement upper extremity ( UE ) activity home community whether specific instruction enhance motor learn carry-over.. Systematic review robot-assisted therapy paretic UE confirm gain motor capacity measure clinical assessment , provide little evidence improve UE performance daily tasks occupation . These finding may attribute limited availability rehabilitation robot train paretic hand primary focus intensity practice little regard principle motor learn experience-dependent neuroplasticity . These principle , include salience training task , transfer acquire skill similar activity , active engagement problem solving , key task-oriented training paradigm stroke ( e.g . constraint-induced movement therapy ) well integrated robot-assisted therapy protocol . The transfer robot-trained movement UE activity within home community need exploration widespread use rehabilitation practice expect .</detailed_description>
