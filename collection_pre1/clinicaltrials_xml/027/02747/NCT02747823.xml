	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate bioequivalence new formulation bevacizumab call CBT124 safety compare two already market formulation , one approve US EU Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) . Adult healthy male age 18 50 year ( inclusive ) participate trial . Participants randomise ( allocated chance ) either test formulation one two market formulation bevacizumab . Drugs administer intravenously . The study compare safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( level drug blood ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) ( drug body ) immunogenicity ( body 's immune response ) 3 drug . In order measure , blood sample collect various point treatment give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PK Bioequivalence Single-dose Safety Tolerability Study Healthy Male Volunteers Compare CBT124 &amp; Avastin ( EU &amp; US )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cipla BioTec , pharmaceutical company ( company develop drug ) , develop formulation bevacizumab call CBT124 similar Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) . The formulation , intend intravenous ( vein ) administration treatment certain cancer . CBT124 also type monoclonal antibody propose biological activity similar bevacizumab . Research CBT124 indicate act Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) body . It expect CBT124 provide clinical advantage market drug Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) . The main purpose study test whether CBT124 behave human body Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) i.e . produce amount/concentration drug blood EU USA market drug , Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) . This call 'biosimilar ' study . The study compare safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( level drug blood ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) ( drug body ) immunogenicity ( body 's immune ( body 's defense system ) response ) 3 drug give intravenously ( vein ) healthy male participant : new drug call CBT124 , market drug Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) approve United States ( US ) , market drug Avastin ( Registered Trademark ) approve European Union ( EU ) . The result compare see drug behave therefore equivalent . In order measure , blood sample collect treatment give amount drug blood measure specific time . In addition , study also compare analyse effect drug immune system blood sample . Safety tolerability drug also monitor compare .</detailed_description>
