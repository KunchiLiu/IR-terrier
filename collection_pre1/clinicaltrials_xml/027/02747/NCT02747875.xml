	<brief_title>Methadone vs. Fentanyl Administration Postoperative Pain Control Pediatric Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study conduct Children 's National Health System ( CNHS ) . Pediatric subject undergoing cardiac surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass recruit . Eligible consent participant assign unique identification number randomly assign receive either methadone fentanyl use computer-generated randomization scheme . A total 52 participant enrol arm study , provide 80 % power detect 30 % difference group . Once informed consent obtain inpatient pharmacist CNHS randomly assign eligible participant receive methadone fentanyl . The pharmacist prepare 0.3 mcg/kg methadone 20 mcg/kg fentanyl load dose administration , dilute 10 mL . The IDS pharmacy store maintain medication per Department Pharmacy standard operating procedure waste control substance ( C-II ) drug . The treatment phase begin induction general anesthesia finish end surgical procedure . Standard anesthetic practice monitoring , induction , maintenance general anesthesia preserve throughout . Participants receive either 0.3 mg/kg methadone 20 mcg/kg fentanyl prior surgical incision , 20 minute . The medication prepare described research staff personnel well study participant blind treatment group assignment . As per standard anesthetic practice , subject continue evaluate hemodynamic stability , postoperative risk bleeding , respiratory effort . Morphine 0.05 mg/kg per dose administer intravenously need pain control . Surgical procedure time record operative report via electronic medical record . Postoperative ICU Phase The postoperative cardiac intensive care unit phase begin admission Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) end third day hospital admission . Postoperative care include hemodynamic stability , resuscitation , respiratory support discretion CICU team . As per CICU protocol , nurse monitor record vital sign pain scale ( FLACC ) score begin handoff anesthesia team intensive care team . The nurse continue document vital sign include : blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , temperature , minute ventilation mechanically ventilate , oxygen supplementation appropriate , electronic medical record every hour . As per nursing protocol , FLACC score record electronic medical record every 4 hour nursing staff witness pain entirety subject 's CICU stay . All subject receive analgesic sedation medication base CICU postoperative pain control agitation protocol Data Collection The investigator designee , blind group assignment , collect relevant data electronic medical record within six month cardiac surgery enter Medical Center 's proprietary web-based data-entry data-management system , REDcap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) . The source information medical record Children 's National Health System `` Anesthesiology '' `` Bear Tracks '' information system provide Cerner Corporation . Data obtain specifically research purpose . Subject identifier ( e.g . name , date birth , address ) enter REDcap system . The previously assign unique identification number use . Statistical Considerations Significance measure 30 % reduction postoperative pain requirement . Statistical analysis use evaluate difference randomization group opioid-related adverse event first 24-hour postoperative period .</detailed_description>
