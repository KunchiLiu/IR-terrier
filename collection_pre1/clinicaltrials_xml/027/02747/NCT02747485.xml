	<brief_summary>New strategy need early detect myocardial involvement disease . Histological study show diffuse fibrosis cardiomyocyte hypertrophy precede LV remodelling ( dilatation ) observe cardiac imaging . Quantification LV diffuse myocardial fibrosis use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) could reach goal . Recently , contrast enhance cardiac MRI use measure extracellular volume fraction ( ECV ) myocardium , able detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis . In disease increase collagen deposition enlarge extra-cellular space , ECV act fibrosis index . ECV correlate amount fibrosis measure histology . Left ventricular overload induce regurgitant VHD result cardiomyocyte hypertrophy diffuse fibrosis . Other method use estimate degree myocardial fibrosis serum level galectine-3 ST2 . Moreover , although pathophysiological mechanism lead occurrence myocardial fibrosis differ patient various cardiac disease , cellular effector fibrotic remodelling common involve similar signalling pathway . At cellular level , key progression ventricular hypertrophy associate increased cardiomyocytes apoptosis fibrosis , suggest two process responsible transition . To knowledge , study analysed impact rate myocardial diffuse fibrosis , non-invasively estimate ECV , risk LV dysfunction MR AR , especially surgery . The measurement ECV could become important tool risk stratification left-sided regurgitant VHD . Thus , would provide early marker LV myocardial involvement occurrence global remodeling , might help physicians surgical decision , would improve prognosis . This innovative original project use modern image modality answer crucial question . The clinical implication would important work would modify international surgical indication MR AR order finally improve prognosis patient frequent heart disease . Moreover , investigator analyze genetic factor influence myocardial reaction result regurgitation , improve quality work offer new future perspective . Investigators hypothesize ECV measurement could use early predictor LV dysfunction left-sided valve regurgitation .</brief_summary>
