	<brief_title>A Trial SHR3680 Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 phase . In dose escalation phase , 6 dose level SHR3680 ( 40 mg/day , 80 mg/day , 160 mg/day , 240 mg/day , 360 mg/day , 480 mg/day ) investigate sequential `` 3+3 '' design ( 3 6 participant dose level ) . There single-dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) run-in period ( 7 day ) . Following first dose , participant enter 1 week treatment-free period evaluate safety single-dose PK . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) observe 1-week period , SHR3680 administration resume dose level . In expansion phase , 12 additional participant enrol MTD recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . The purpose expansion part study explore clinical benefit SHR3680 identify PK feature .</detailed_description>
