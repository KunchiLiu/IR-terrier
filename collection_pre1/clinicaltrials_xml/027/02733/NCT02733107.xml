	<brief_summary>The development anti-angiogenesis drug lead renew enthusiasm lung cancer treatment . Apatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor selectively inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) . Etoposide oral preparation lung cancer recommend NCCN guideline . The investigator wonder whether two drug synergistic effect treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer patient fail previous least 2nd line treatment . Thus , aim trial investigate efficacy safety apatinib combine etoposide heavily pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
