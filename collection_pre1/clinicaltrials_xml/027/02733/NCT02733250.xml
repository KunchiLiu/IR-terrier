	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab With Nab-Paclitaxel Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1/2 , open-label , proof concept study nab-paclitaxel administered combination pembrolizumab patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Part 1 study ass dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) nab-paclitaxel combination fix dose pembrolizumab ( 200 mg administer day 1 21 day cycle ) . Dose escalation nab-paclitaxel conduct accord `` 3+3 design '' recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) determine . Part 2 study evaluate administration pembrolizumab dose 200 mg every 3 week combination nab-paclitaxel RP2D . Determining RP2D classify treatment combination safe allow expansion study population , ultimately lead assessment safety tolerability well evaluation anti-tumoral effect propose treatment combination . Using Simon 's optimal 2-stage design Phase II clinical trial , determine sample size 36 patient would adequate test propose hypothesis . The primary efficacy analysis overall response rate ( ORR ) interpret follow : 1 ) less 9 partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) record , combination nab-paclitaxel pembrolizumab provide less additive effect likely clinically superior compare pembrolizumab alone base ORR assessment ; 2 ) however , 9 PR CR record , treatment combination warrant clinical study . This could take form extend phase II ( reach 97 patient calculated model ) phase III study . Treatment continue disease progression ( per RECIST 1.1 ) , unacceptable adverse event ( ) , intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , investigator 's decision withdraw subject , investigator 's noncompliance trial treatment procedures requirement , subject receive 24 month uninterrupted treatment 35 administration study medication ( whichever later ) , administrative reason .</detailed_description>
