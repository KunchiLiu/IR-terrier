	<brief_title>Adherence Lenalidomide Treatment Multiple Myeloma - Prevalence , Characteristics Clinical Significance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Hypothesis : We hypothesize non-adherence lenalidomide MM patient associate decreased overall response rate shorter time progression ( TTP ) . Study Objectives : Primary Objective : To evaluate association non-adherence lenalidomide MM patient overall response rate 6 month . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) To evaluate prevalence non-adherence lenalidomide MM patient , independent risk factor thereof . 2 ) To validate utility questionnaire assess adherence identify MM patient risk lenalidomide non-adherence.3 ) To assess association non-adherence lenalidomide long-term response , measure time progression ( TTP ) 18 month . Background : Lenalidomide-based regimen key component armamentarium initial treatment newly diagnose multiple myeloma patient . Real-life data show CR rate comparable slightly high 1than see prospective clinical trial . This variable response result difference clinical setting patient disease characteristic , theory , also may due variable adherence lenalidomide . The development oral anticancer therapy , lenalidomide , represent significant step forward oncology care provide patient convenient treatment proven clinical efficacy , also present healthcare professional challenge monitor maintain patient ' adherence therapy . Non-adherence may define , example , non-perfect adherence ( i.e . le 100 % ) , another cutoff proven clinical significance , simply numerical value represent percentage medication take , relative recommend . This definition , together method use measure adherence , greatly influence report rate non-adherence give clinical setting . Taking limitation account , report rate non-adherence oral anti-cancer regimen across empirical study average approximately 25 % 2,3.Accordingly , use pharmacy refill data , recent retrospective study demonstrate 33 % newly diagnose MM patient non-adherent lenalidomide treatment ( define adherence &lt; 80 % ) 4 . This study , assess adherence lenalidomide MM patient , aware . Using electronic monitoring ( EM ) , Marin et al prospectively demonstrated poor adherence tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , imatinib , CML , adversely impact molecular cytogenetic response 5,6.This landmark study provide proof concept non-adherence oral anti-cancer hematological malignancy may associate poor response decrease survival . Our study group currently analyze data prospective interventional study aim improve adherence TKIs CML ( NCT01768689 ) . In light evidence , era witness advent effective oral agent MM , understand prevalence , characteristic clinical implication non-adherence agent key provide high-quality care patient . Nevertheless , research regard adherence oral agent MM ( e.g . thalidomide , lenalidomide , pomalidomide ) still infancy , data indicate whether similar association adherence treatment response exist field . Moreover , paucity data regard prevalence non-adherence risk factor thereof , context . Study design : Prospective multi-center observational ( non-interventional ) cohort study.Patients manage routinely accord local protocol center treatment multiple myeloma . Study period : From initiation lenalidomide therapy period 18 month . Setting location : Institute hematology , Sheba medical center Hematology Institute Davidoff cancer center , Rabin medical center , Israel . Inclusion criterion : Patients diagnose active MM start induction treatment lenalidomide without dexamethasone , line therapy . Key exclusion criterion : Treatment additional anti-myeloma drug , study period . Patient characteristic confounders : Patient characteristic ( demographic , comorbidities ) ; Disease-related characteristic ( duration , myeloma stage risk , detail regard previous therapy response , functional status , quality life ) ; Other drug ( Number drug , pill potential interaction lenalidomide ) . We use adaptation questionnaire `` BRIGHT '' study ( assess barrier immunosuppressive medication adherence heart transplant recipient ) ass barrier adherence patient cohort . Measurement adherence : Adherence lenalidomide treatment measure continuously throughout study period , several mean : 1 ) Electronic monitoring ( EM ) use throughout first 5 month study period . This consider gold standard measure adherence , reflect adherence objectively questionnaires pill-counting . The microelectronic monitoring system ( MEMS ) , specific type EM , consist electronic device Ô¨Åtted cap normal-looking medication bottle automatically record time bottle open . Adherence measure device associate treatment response landmark study CML Marin et al . 2 ) Pill count first five month . 3 ) Questionnaires : The physician visual analogue scale ( physician VAS ) adaptation `` Basel assessment adherence Immunosuppressive Regimen Scale '' ( BAASIS ) , assess predefined time point throughout 18 month study period . Outcome Measures : Primary outcome measure : Response treatment ( Overall response ) 4 week finish five month electronic adherence monitoring ( i.e . 6 month ) . Analysis : Primary analysis : Incidence primary outcome measure patient electronically measure adherence 90 % versus 90 % , measure 5 consecutive month study initiation . Secondary analysis : 1 ) Analyze association baseline characteristic / confounders adherence-barriers questionnaire electronically-measured adherence look independent risk factor non-adherence . This stratified line treatment . 2 ) Validation study questionnaire compare electronically measure adherence . 3 ) A long-term analysis look association TTP 18 month initial adherence measure electronically ( first 5 month ) long term overall adherence measure BAASIS questionnaire ( 18months ) . Sample size : In prior study7 , ORR ( i.e . PR good ) 68 % Rd arm , 4 cycle . A prior study CML show profound effect adherence 90 % optimal treatment response ( RR=11 ) 5 . As data exists regard effect adherence outcome study population utilized RR conservative ( &lt; 2 ) , relative data CML . We assume 80 % ORR 6 month adherent group 45 % ORR 6 month non-adherent group ( define cutoff 90 % adherence ) . Prior data8 suggest adherent/non-adherent ratio patient receive lenalidomide induction myeloma 7:3 , assume similar ratio 2:1 . Based data , calculate 43 patient adherent arm 22 patient non-adherent arm power 0.8 ( type I error 0.05 ) reject null hypothesis difference ORR group . Therefore required sample size 67 .</detailed_description>
