	<brief_summary>This study determine pembrolizumab safe tolerable select dose treatment Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) patient performance status 2 . All patient receive pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Pembrolizumab NSCLC PS2 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) common type lung cancer . There several study demonstrate role immune system fight lung cancer . However , multiple mechanism cancer dampen response . The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction one major pathway hijack tumour help evade detection elimination cell immune system . A number compound block pathway , include drug pembrolizumab , show impressive result patient . At present trial pembrolizumab report thus far patient good Performance Status 0-1 , measure daily activity . Unfortunately many patient lung cancer impair performance status , make ineligible trial new therapy include anti PD-1 . Clinical trial standard-of-care therapy successfully perform PS=2 population demonstrate feasibility perform clinical trial population . In trial , investigator would like determine whether drug use treat Performance status 2 patient low general daily activity . The purpose trial determine pembrolizumab safe tolerable . The investigator would also like see well treatment work , find information tumour shrinkage , learn disease change time .</detailed_description>
