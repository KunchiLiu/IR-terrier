	<brief_title>Effectiveness Diabetes Conversation Map Program Among Diabetic Patients Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design participants A quasi-experimental pre-posttest control group design , purposive sampling , use recruit participant Endocrinology department hospital southern Taiwan January May 2014 . The inclusion criterion ( ) least 20 year old time recruitment ( ii ) cognitive impairment severe complication , ( iii ) able express opinion either Mandarin Taiwanese , ( iv ) diagnosis diabetes . To ensure participant ' anonymity , questionnaires mark encryption code facilitate data analysis , personal identifier . Sample size calculation Sample size calculation analysis repeat measure detect effect size 0.2 80 % power 0.05 significance level indicate sample size 68 patient need ( accord G- POWER 3.1 analytical software , Franz Faul , Universitat Kiel , Germany ) . A sample least 89 participant group combine require basis parameter , allow 30 % attrition rate . Intervention Because continued participation essential study , participant divide experiment control group accordance personal willingness . The control group receive routine health education last 30 minute per medical visit , consist consultation disease symptom , related treatment , self-care skill . They would receive health education instruction leaflets reference purpose necessary . The experiment group receive seven Diabetes Conversation Map Program ( DCMP ) -based group education session ( 10-12 participant , 1.5 hour ) seven consecutive week addition routine health education private room outpatient unit . One register nurse receive DCMP facilitator training , Taiwanese Association Diabetic Educators , serve class facilitator . DCMP session conduct use seven color `` map '' cover different topic , include `` walk diabetes , '' `` diabetes ? `` , `` healthy diet exercise , '' `` walk insulin , '' `` diabetes complication related risk factor , '' `` foot care diabetes patient , '' `` type 1 diabetes patient home . '' Each map , laminate 3-by-5-foot table-top visual colorful drawing metaphor situation familiar DM patient , place table participant gather around . This procedure serve create mutual imagery share participant . In addition use colored map , facilitator offer participant self-designed conversation card ask share individual glycemic control experience base question show card . Outcome measure The primary outcome comprise weekly self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) time biochemical parameter contain BMI , HbA1c fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) . In addition , depressive symptom well level diabetes health literacy also measure , determine Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire ( TDQ ) self-administered questionnaire regard diabetes health literacy . The TDQ develop accord criterion specify Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( Third Edition ) consist 18 self-reported item . Its total score range 0 54 , high score indicate severe depressive symptom . On hand , diabetes health literacy , measure self-developed questionnaire . This scale contain 20 item score use 5-point Likert scale , high total score indicate positive diabetic health literacy . Covariates Additional item address demographic disease characteristic develop base clinical experience literature review , collect study entry via patient interview medical record . Demographic data include sex , age , marital status , education level , religion , household status , monthly income , certain lifestyle factor , smoking , exercise habit , presence sleep disturbance . Smoking status record `` non-smoker '' `` current ex-smoker . '' Those exercise regularly ( i.e. , weekly ) classify `` exercise habit . '' Sleep disturbance define wake night twice without external factor week interview . Disease characteristic include presence chronic disease ( i.e. , stroke , hypertension , heart disease , renal disease , cancer ) , medication regimen , duration diabetes . Data collection procedure The study protocol approve Ethics Committee Dalin Tzuchi Hospital ( No . B10002009 ) prior recruitment participant . Researchers explain purpose study procedure participant . Signed informed consent obtain understood agree participate study . Thereafter , investigator apply observer-blind approach data collection . A trained interviewer , familiar participant , assign collect participant ' information demographic disease characteristic . All data obtain three time point : DCMP ( T0 ) , three day DCMP ( T1 ) , three month DCMP ( T2 ) . To reduce dropout rate , researcher ask participant return hospital completion assessment via phone reminder . However , participant still give option withdraw study time without penalty . Statistical analysis Descriptive inferential statistical analysis conduct accordance study aim nature variable . Descriptive parameter , include mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , percentage , use describe distribution demographic disease data . Differences two group compare initially use t-test Ï‡2 test appropriate . For inferential analysis , investigator use generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) procedure identity link function normal distribution ass long-term effect DCMP , take account within-subject correlation measurement time influence potential confounding covariates . All analysis conduct use SAS statistical software , Version 9.3 . A p value &lt; .05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
