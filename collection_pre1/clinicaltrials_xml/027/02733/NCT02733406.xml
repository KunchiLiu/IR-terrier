	<brief_title>Hypotensive Effect Anaesthesia With TCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe hypotension may serious complication induction anaesthesia . The patient preoperative clinical circulatory status help define risk side-effect . A patient preexist heart condition increase risk morbidity/mortality relation anaesthesia induction . Total intravenous anaesthesia may deliver two different approach . The old way drug ( Propofol and/or Remifentanil ) deliver velocity ( mg/kg x hour microg/ kg x min ) specify anaesthetist . Hereafter call Velocity Controlled Infusion ( VCI ) . At induction , get effect drug , high infusion rate desire . A high infusion rate associate increase risk hypotension adjust accordance current circulatory status patient . A failure adjust may futile patient . Therefore , induction take time infusion rate set within relatively safe range . After minute , airway control achieve , infusion rate must adjust avoid hypotension . There modern way adjust infusion rate , call Target Controlled Infusion . With approach , pump deliver drug help anaesthetist select appropriate infusion rate give situation . The anaesthetist selects prefer concentration drug target , circulation . The pump administrate drug , first high rate lower rate , take account patient age , weight sex preferred target concentration . It possible help machine associate less risk hypotension anaesthesia induction . If would impact TCI VCI would best choice anaesthesia . This would special impact give anaesthesia patient heart condition .</detailed_description>
