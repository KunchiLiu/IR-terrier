	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced Ultrasonography Detect Human Renal Transplant Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study divide two stage . In first stage investigator assess transplant kidney ultrasound contrast injection ( Sonazoid ) determine contrast kidney detectable ultrasound determine amount perfusion quantify directly qualitatively . The investigator aim one two subject stage . If perfusion kidney assess , investigator move stage two study . In stage 2 , investigator look determine ability contrast enhance ultrasonography method detect renal transplant rejection use Sonazoid . For stage investigator recruit subject biopsy confirm renal transplant rejection . Once subject consent , undergo contrast enhance ultrasonography Sonazoid image take . These image compare image renal transplant patient displayed rejection clinical issue . These clinically normal subject previously consent medical record review investigator may use image .</detailed_description>
