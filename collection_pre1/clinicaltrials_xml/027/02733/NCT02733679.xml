	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate link Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated ( ATM ) gene metformin response . This link identify large study human genome , study aim confirm link clinical study . The ATM gene involve DNA repair - person inherit `` faulty '' copy gene parent , genetic condition call Ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) . A-T associated , among thing , resistance insulin , cause fatty liver diabetes . This study recruit people A-T , develop diabetes , compare group `` healthy '' control , i.e . people A-T diabetes . The study compare group respond two drug use treat diabetes ( metformin pioglitazone ) , intention guide management diabetes A-T . This , open label unblinded study recruit 15 people A-T 15 age gender match control . Each participant three study visit Clinical Research Centre Ninewells hospital Dundee - one baseline , second 8 week metformin final visit eight week pioglitazone .

	<brief_title>Response Individuals With Ataxia-Telangiectasia Metformin Pioglitazone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metformin commonly-prescribed drug , use first-line medical management type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , also off-license non-diabetics Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS ) . Over 120 million people worldwide prescribed metformin . Despite , mechanism action fully understood . Both tolerance response metformin varies greatly patient patient , highlight need research pharmacokinetics dynamic drug . As team diabetes researcher , group interested genetics drug response diabetes . A Genome Wide Association Study carry member group highlight locus carry ATM gene potential link metformin response . We design study investigate link clinically . In hope guide management diabetes condition call Ataxia Telangiectasia . ATM ( Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated ) gene involve DNA repair - homozygous recessive mutation gene cause Ataxia Telangiectasia ( A-T ) , associate cerebellar ataxia , ocular telangiectasia lymphoproliferative cancer . The incidence A-T 1 40,000 1 100,000 live birth , though increase dramatically consanguineous parent . Interestingly , A-T also associate insulin resistance . Both `` fatty liver '' diabetes document patient group , little research link A-T condition . Approximately 1 100 people carrier loss function mutation ATM gene , associate increase risk ischaemic heart disease certain cancer . Several study ATM deficiency mouse model carry . Atm −/− mouse display early defect glucose-stimulated insulin release later develop hyperglycaemia , insulin resistance [ 1 ] . Unpublished data McCrimmon Group University Dundee suggest mice heterozygous ATM deficiency impair fast glucose , demonstrate marked improvement fast glucose metformin . A Cell Reports paper , detail mouse model ATM deficiency , demonstrate insulin resistance ATM deficient mouse , lipodystrophic phenotype [ 2 ] . This phenotype ( paucity subcutaneous fat , increase visceral fat ) attenuate metformin thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) use . A small study publish Pearson group University Dundee , compare data oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTTs ) A-T patient versus healthy individual , confirm increase insulin resistance A-T patient [ 3 ] . As mentioned , genome wide association study , also Pearson group , highlight ATM locus potential genetic link metformin response [ 4 , 5 ] . With mouse model information genetic study , study aim assess insulin resistance A-T patient group , understand respond drug commonly use treat insulin resistance / diabetes . The potential genetic link ATM metformin response investigate . Thus far unclear genetic study ATM deficiency affect individual 's metformin response - response great less general population ? Similarly , magnitude response quantify . There anecdotal report patient A-T marked improvement glycaemic control metformin use . Mouse model study indicate increased response metformin heterozygous ATM deficient mouse . The study also investigate response individual A-T TZDs . Studies mouse model A-T demonstrate response TZD pioglitazone , . Of note , pioglitazone use off-licence non-diabetics treatment Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) [ 6 , 7 ] , therefore know safe use non-diabetic cohort . This study assess effect ATM deficiency metformin pioglitazone response human , study people A-T , compare response match control group . This study recruit non-diabetic individual - 15 case ( people A-T ) vs 15 age gender match control - crossover design . Participants 18 - 30 year age . This age group realistic recruiting patient `` classic '' , oppose `` mild variant '' A-T , people classic A-T rarely survive 30 . Exclusion individual milder form A-T provide detectable difference two cohort . Participants white European descent , narrow genetic difference individual . Ethnic origin also effect individual 's insulin resistance , therefore participant ethnicity . The study make two treatment period last eight week , separate one week washout period . Initial treatment shall metformin , titrate 1000mg twice daily . The second treatment pioglitazone titrate 30mg daily . The study last total approximately 17 week , involve three visit Clinical Research Centre Ninewells hospital Dundee . The first visit long , last 1.5 day , two visit last one full day short preparatory visit 30 minute day . Multiple method use investigate relationship ATM , diabetes drug response : - Dual tracer mixed meal test indirect calorimetry ( see Tracer Studies SOP ) - MRI ( see MRI SOP ) - Blood urine sampling ( see Sample Collection SOP ) - Fat biopsy ( see Fat Biopsy SOP ) In summary , individual three tracer study : initial study baseline ; second eight week metformin ; final tracer study eight week TZD , pioglitazone . Tracer study involve standardise meal night study , fast midnight preparation . No alcohol consume 24 hour study . On day tracer study two cannulae insert , one forearm . One cannula use infuse stable glucose tracer [ 6,6-2H2 ] duration eight hour study . After two hour infusion , participant feed mixed meal contain [ U-13C ] glucose ( stable ) . The participant observe six hour , [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose infusion continue . Throughout tracer study , blood take second cannula multiple time-points , allow measurement glucose ( include tracer ) , insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) nonesterified fatty acid ( NEFAs ) . A total 150ml blood take tracer study . Urine collect two phase ( meal ) tracer study , measurement glucose excretion . Indirect calorimetry use twenty minute episodes several time-points measure substrate utilisation study . This involve participant wear `` hood '' lightweight , see-through visor . All measurement enable u model glucose flux participant calculate index insulin sensitivity . Repetition tracer study two anti-hyperglycaemic agent provide comparison index treatment . At baseline visit MRI , blood sample fat biopsy take place half day visit tracer study . This allow u assess fat distribution use MRI obtain adipose tissue carry lab-based study assess adipocyte function response metformin pioglitazone . Blood sample take `` safety blood '' ( i.e . ensure normal renal function HbA1c &lt; 48mmol/mol ) also future DNA analysis , confirm diagnosis A-T group , check carrier status control . Visits two three involve full day clinical research centre ( CRC ) tracer study . On day tracer , short half-hour visit obtain `` safety blood '' ( case , check renal function ) provide standardise meal necessary prepare tracer study follow day . If study clinically confirm hypothesis individual ATM-deficiency respond well either metformin pioglitazone , individual show marked improvement insulin resistance take either study drug , study could direct clinical decision-making care patient A-T fatty liver / insulin resistance . In conjunction clinical study cell experiment study carry induced pluripotent stem cell ( IPSC ) derive hepatocytes individual A-T , assess drug response cellular level . This collaboration Sanger Institute Cambridge , already develop IPSC-derived hepatocytes blood A-T patient . These cell use create drug response model cellular level . These cell line recruit patient directly , serve cellular model A-T . However , offer A-T group chance donate blood INSIGNIA study , run Sanger Institute , study focus investigation pattern mutation ( signature ) inherit progressive genetic disease ( please see INSIGNIA PIS consent form ) . This optional take part RAMP commit A-T contributing INSIGNIA .</detailed_description>
