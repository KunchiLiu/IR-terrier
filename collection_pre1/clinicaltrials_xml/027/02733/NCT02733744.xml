	<brief_summary>This research study study intervention call fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) . Patients schedule undergo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation invite take part clinical trial undergo empiric FMT soon hematopoietic engraftment . The primary endpoint ass feasibility FMT population ass safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation After HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The microbiome ( spectrum bacteria patient 's gut ) think play role help shape one 's immune system give direct contact normal cell intestine . Recent study suggest microbiome bacteria ( low diversity ) seem bad health high-diversity microbiome ( many different specie ) appear good . This appear true even patient HSCT low diversity microbiome status correlate infection , GVHD overall survival . Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) routinely perform infection cause Clostridium difficile yet approve FDA treatment disease . FMT restore high diversity microbiome . It hop FMT , overall outcome HSCT potentially improve . FMT perform first 3 week recovery white blood cell HSCT . The source FMT healthy 3rd party donor . FMT perform ingestion 30 capsule 2 consecutive day .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Men woman ≥ 18 ≤ 65 year old Patients designate undergo myeloablative intermediate intensity allogeneic peripheral blood bone marrow hematopoietic cell transplantation . Consent obtain prior admission HSCT . Patients receive donor source stem cell eligible . Eligible conditioning regimen define myeloablative Consensus Criteria ( Bacigalupo 2009 ) well combination fludarabine melphalan ( 100140 mg/mg2 ) Any GraftvsHost disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis regimen allow . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % , see Appendix A ) Patients adequate physical function measure Cardiac : Left ventricular ejection fraction rest must ≥ 40 % , shorten fraction &gt; 25 % . Hepatic : Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL , except patient Gilbert 's syndrome hemolysis Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; 5 x Upper Limit Institutional Normal Range ( ULN ) . Renal : Serum creatinine within normal range , serum creatinine outside normal range , renal function ( measure estimate creatinine clearance GFR ) ≥ 40millileters/min/1.73m2 . Pulmonary : Diffusing lung capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) ( correct hemoglobin ) , Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ≥ 50 % predict . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study 3 month FMT . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document , include willingness accept risk unrelated donor stool . Ability swallow oral medication . Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . ( Patients may receive prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant . ) Participants receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients active uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection ( ) require systemic therapy . Patients history primary idiopathic myelofibrosis severe marrow fibrosis . Planned use prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) therapy . Delayed gastric empty syndrome Known chronic aspiration Patients history significant allergy food exclude donor diet ( exclude food tree nut , peanut , shellfish , egg ) Pregnant breastfeed woman ineligible eligible hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . HIVpositive participant ineligible . Participants unable swallow pill . Participants endstage liver disease ( cirrhosis ) Participants acute , active gastrointestinal infection ( e.g. , typhlitis , diverticulitis , appendicitis ) Participants inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's )</criteria>
