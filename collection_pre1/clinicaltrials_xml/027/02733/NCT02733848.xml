Investigators hypothesize RYGB patient incomplete carbohydrate absorption small intestine lead inconsistent glucose level hypoglycemia oral consumption meal . Investigators hypothesize pancreatic enzyme supplementation ( Creon ) meal snack improve carbohydrate absorption lead stable glucose level patient post-RYGB hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>
