	<detailed_description>The improvement care pathway oncology patient Clinical Pharmacy activity outpatient ( pharmaceutical consultation ) implement evaluate . In order improve care pathway patient anticancer oral therapy , investigator suggest research project integrate medical care `` Clinical Pharmacy follow-up '' patient hospital form `` pharmaceutical consultation '' . These pharmaceutical consultation carry coordination hospital clinical team also aim make link hospital community pharmacist . These pharmaceutical consultation initiate Marseille Grenoble University Hospitals order know special needs patient oral chemotherapy . However , impact pharmaceutical consultation population patient receive ambulatory oral therapy remain unknown need evaluate use objective criterion rate adverse event consequence considerable patient society . These observation prompt u establish randomize controlled study objective assess impact Clinical Pharmacy consultation cancer patient treat oral anti-cancer therapy general care management : occurrence serious adverse event ( primary outcome ) . This bicenter , prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , open-label , two-parallel group study perform assess efficacy pharmaceutical consultation experimental group ( full clinical medication review ) pharmaceutical interview control group ( Patient Therapeutic Education oral anticancer drug ) . Depending result randomization patient find one 2 parallel arm : - Control group : standard course + short pharmaceutical interview ( therapeutic education ) - Experimental group : standard course + long pharmaceutical consultation ( include full clinical medication review therapeutic education ) Control group : therapeutic education short pharmaceutical interview The patient allocate control group `` classic '' course treatment . They receive best medical care offer participate therapeutic education program place participate center include : - An educational assessment consist evaluate patient 's educational need . - Group workshops entitle `` Disease drug '' , `` Dietary sport activity '' , `` Psychology Workshop '' patient able participate order get information need . - Individual therapeutic education session specifically personally highlight certain non-pharmaceutical educational need identify time educational assessment . Moreover , control arm , systematic `` short pharmaceutical interview '' average duration 15 minute propose patient initiation treatment , D15 prescription ( consider date inclusion ) M1 every 3 month ( M3 , M6 , M9 M12 ) : - Dosage , include maximum dosage modular take drug - Duration treatment - User precaution - The necessary information drug use - Any special precaution take information relevant good understanding treatment patient - Biological analyzes necessary initiation , monitoring , pursuit certain treatment Experimental group : Clinical Pharmacy Long Pharmaceutical Consultations In experimental group , patient receive course treatment patient control group , include D0 short pharmaceutical interview , prerogatives acceptance rejection participation TPE program . Short pharmaceutical interview D15 M12 replace long pharmaceutical consultation 30 60 minute . The latter consist full clinical medication review incorporate pedagogic aspect address short pharmaceutical interview therapeutic drug take patient . Additional consultation possible request oncologist and/or patient . The consultation carry request oncologist and/or patient count . The first part pharmaceutical consultation focus complete clinical medication review include : - Establishment patient profile : medical history , drug allergy intolerance , comorbidities , age , understand capacity , organizational capacityâ€¦ - Establishment list current treatment ( cancer treatment , treatment comorbidities , self-medication , product ) . The effective use drug discuss patient . - Study health behavior : - Concerning self-medication ( reason , active ingredient , dos , etc . ) alternative medicine - Addictions ( smoking , alcohol ... ) - Drug adherence - List grade ( NCI version 4 ) clinical sign laboratory abnormality : - The biological data obtain basis biological test result address oncologist test result provide patient - Clinical sign obtain patient question The second part consultation achieve firstly pharmaco-therapeutic analysis treatment ( level 3 pharmaceutical analysis accord criterion French Society Clinical Pharmacy ) order detect problem drug classify French Society Clinical Pharmacy ( 18 ) . The third step consultation consist provide `` pharmaceutical intervention '' follow pharmaco-therapeutic analysis ( 18 ) . These pharmaceutical intervention might concern prescribers , caregiver , patient . These intervention do absolute respect French Code Public Health . All intervention document , track , evaluate , particularly term acceptance prescribers . Sample size Both center necessary number patient needed ensure proper recruitment require study . The annual throughput AP-HM 300 patient . Targeted disease part research project gastrointestinal tumor ( GIST , colorectal ) , neuroendocrine , renal , gynecological , urological ( prostate ) skin ( melanoma ) cancer . The annual throughput Grenoble University Hospital 70 patient . Targeted diseases renal tumor , breast colorectal cancer . The number subject include require determined primary endpoint , namely rate adverse event grade III-IV . Data current practice main center ( AP- HM ) literature estimate rate 35 % . The majority adverse event related drug preventable , investigator estimate decrease 20 point rate experimental arm , say rate 15 % . 166 subject ( 83 per group ) need power 90 % alpha risk 5 % . To compensate potential lose sight ( estimate around 15 % ) , investigator include 190 subject total . The sample size determine obtain 90 % power detect 20 percent difference 2 group , difference consider clinically significant . In accordance previous study ( 26-31 ) , investigator hypothesize occurrence primary endpoint 35 % control group . With threshold statistical significance set p-value 0.05 ( two-sided alpha ) , calculation show 166 patient need ( 83 per group ) . Assuming potentially 15 % patient lose follow-up , total 190 individual need include .</detailed_description>
