	<brief_summary>The MD-Logic Automated Insulin Delivery System intend patient type 1 diabetes mellitus subcutaneous infusion insulin continuous measurement interstitial glucose aid management diabetes . The product automatically adjust basal insulin delivery delivers correction bolus response real-time glucose measurement CGM maintain blood glucose within desired range , improve metabolic control without increase risk hypoglycemia . The propose study open-label , two-center , randomize , cross-over study evaluate safety efficacy night closed-loop control use MD-Logic automated insulin delivery system compare sensor augment pump therapy poorly control patient type 1 diabetes home The objective pilot study evaluate safety efficacy 4 week glucose control use MD-Logic System individual poorly control type 1 diabetes patient 's home</brief_summary>
