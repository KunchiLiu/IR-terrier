	<brief_summary>The objective study gain preliminary information knowledge metabolic profile ASD . The benefit study expand insight potential relationship metabolic process neuropsychological function ASD . For example , base obtain data study determine whether link tryptophan pathway cognitive function autism . The project base systematic multidisciplinary approach use tracer delineate mechanism metabolism amino acid like TRP involve affective cognitive function ASD . Using innovative approach evaluation amino acid use adult ASD . In addition , obtain data study hold promise develop specific marker ( metabolic and/or neuropsychological ) guide identification individual increase risk develop mood disturbance cognitive impairment , predict therapeutic effect specific nutritional intervention subject ASD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate metabolic profile different amino acid cognitive function adult adolescent ASD comparison age- gender-matched healthy young adult . The study involve 1 screen visit approximately 2 hour 1 study day 5 hour The objective explore change amino acid ( e.g . TRP pathway ) ASD evaluate function TRP neuropsychological function use technique stable isotope newly develop 'single pulse method ' multiple amino acid keto-acid isotope . The aim study determine underlie mechanism metabolism amino acid TRP involve mood cognitive function ADS .</detailed_description>
