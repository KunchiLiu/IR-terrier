	<brief_title>The Impact Different Feeding Strategies During Packed Red Cell Transfusion Intestinal Oxygenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Necrotizing enterocolitis important cause mortality morbidity neonate . Especially neonates , small 32 week gestational , need transfusion hospital stay . Recent evidence suggest relation antecedent PRBC transfusion increase necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . It report transfusion relate NEC ( TR-NEC ) tend occur immediately 48 hour post-transfusion . Although underlying mechanism relationship still overinvestigation , alter oxygenation mesenteric vasculature PRBC transfusion hypothesize contribute NEC development . But pathophysiology clear , yet . Nowadays , due increase risk NEC PRBC transfusion , different nutrition protocol implement different unit . These protocol contain permanent discontinuation , reducement continuation nutrition transfusion . As result , still evidence -based practice recommendation regard . `` Restricted Transfusion Guidelines '' use decision transfusion premature infant . Patients divide three different group , accord feed regimen transfusion . Group 1 : No enteral feeding ( two hour ) , ( 3 hour ) ( two hour ) red blood cell transfusion . Group 2 : Enteral feeding reduce % 50 , red blood cell transfusion . Group 3 : The feeding volume continue without decrease stop . Groups determine randomization . It target least twenty infant group . In patient , mesenteric oxygenation compare before-during blood transfusion . Mesenteric oxygenation measure Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , non-invasive NIRS conduct technology . Cerebral oxygenation peripheral oxygen saturation measure timeline . The investigator primary aim show best method feed transfusion cause less feeding intolerance NEC . The secondary outcome risk factor associate feed intolerance NEC PRBC transfusion , premature baby .</detailed_description>
