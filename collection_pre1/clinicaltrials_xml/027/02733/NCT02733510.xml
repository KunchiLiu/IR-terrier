	<brief_summary>- The purpose study evaluate impact steroid pulse therapy ( SPT ) SCR reveal PB KT recipient maintain TAC/MMF corticosteroid . - In institution , since routine protocol biopsy perform 2 week , 1 year , 2 year renal transplantation , practically difficult graft survival use endpoint randomize controlled trial . - From meta-analysis 31 observational study , acute rejection associate increase risk graft loss risk ratio range 1.2 - 10.5 . Furthermore , chronic allograft nephropathy graft survival strongly correlate acute rejection episode first year renal transplantation . - Therefore , aim study investigate effect early steroid pulse therapy reduction acute rejection episode first year KT patient show subclinical change 2-week protocol biopsy . - The histological feature 1 year PB , graft function ( represent serum creatinine level eGFR ) 1st year KT compare SCR group non-SCR group . - Additional benefit include early detection polioma BK virus associate nephritis ( BKVAN ) relapse underlying disease also evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- All recipient receive induction therapy basiliximab rATG triple maintenance immunosuppression TAC/MMF corticosteroid . - PB 2 week 1 year transplantation perform use 18-gauge needle ultrasound guidance . - Patients get PB candidate study . - Methylprednisolone 0.5 g daily 3 day administer patient SCR . - Information enrol patient include age , sex , height , body weight , serum creatinine level , modality dialysis , duration dialysis , panel reactive antibody , donor specific antibody , HLA mismatch , ABO incompatibility history previous transplantation collect . These data safely control person charge . Patient name change initial registration number hospital change new registration number study . - laboratory test include WBC , BUN , creatinine , FK level , MPA level , CMV virus DNA load , BK virus DNA load , urine nitrate , urine leukocyte esterase , urine BK virus DNA load , urine culture chest X-ray check 14th post-operative day every month 1year KT . - Enrolled patient follow 1 year routinely undergo 1-year protocol biopsy . - Within 1 year follow period , clinical biopsy perform recipient ' serum creatinine level raise 25 % baseline level . - The primary end point - Biopsy proven acute rejection event within 1 year renal transplantation - Histologic feature include persistent SCR ( presence SCR 2-week 1-year protocol biopsy ) , chronic nephropathy 1-year protocol biopsy . - Graft kidney function estimate serum creatinine level eGFR - The incidence opportunistic infection include pneumonia , urinary tract infection , tuberculosis , fungal infection , viral infection ( cytomegalo , polyoma , parvo-virus ) within 1 year - Secondary end point include effect early detection polioma BK virus associate nephritis ( BKVAN ) relapse underlying disease</detailed_description>
