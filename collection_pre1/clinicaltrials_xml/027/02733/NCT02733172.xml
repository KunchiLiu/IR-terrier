	<brief_title>Profiling Vulvodynia Based Neurobiological Behavioral Endophenotypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vulvodynia ( VD ) chronic pain disorder affect 15 % woman result substantial impairment health-related quality-of-life . The treatment disorder hamper lack knowledge regard neurobiological basis . The propose study base general hypothesis like persistent pain condition , VD clinical phenotype ( characteristic disorder ) compose multiple biological endophenotypes ( hereditary characteristic normally associate condition direct symptom condition ) meaningful subgroup identify . In current proposal , investigator plan extensively phenotype large sample VD patient use functional structural brain image together genetic , physiological , biological parameter . The hypothesis central mechanism ( include alteration processing/modulation interoceptive signal external genitals ) important determinant clinical presentation , difference brain signature could play important role treatment responsiveness . Such phenotyping considerable implication future drug development . There total 100 female diagnose either generalize vulvodynia ( GVD ) provoke vestibulodynia ( PVD ) similar however localized vestibule area vulva enrol . It total 140 PVD 60 GVD . The study involve 2 visit total 1-3 week depend schedule menstrual cycle . The investigator scan person menstruate AND abdominal cramps/emotional liability may confound analysis . The participant screen inclusion /exclusion criterion . After sign consent participant history physical brief psychological interview evaluation psychological problem present ( use standard DSM-IV ( diagnostic statistical manual mental disorder ) criterion . The participant complete questionnaire assess mood , pain , pain related behavior sexual functioning Survey Monkey . The participant neuro-sensory evaluation perineum perform qualified gynecologist Medical Doctor Nurse Practitioner . During examination clinician swab vaginal canal use 2 sterile swab ( vaginal fluid ) microbiota ( normal vaginal healthy bacteria ) . There 1 venous blood draw 2 teaspoon via venipuncture nurse , look blood metabolite gene . Then participant discomfort threshold test right leave shin upper arm muscle algometer . Following screen participant return within 1-3 week brain scan do involve functional ( rest state ) structural scan . The investigator measure change autonomic nervous system simultaneously electrodes finger tip measure minute change sweat gland . Saliva sample collect analysis polymorphism gene control inflammation , pain , nerve functioning . Prior scan participant ask complete questionnaire assess current ( state ) mood symptom Survey Monkey . The length time visit assess 90 minute .</detailed_description>
