	<brief_title>Mechanism Sorafenib Resistance Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) major health problem , account 626,000 new case per year worldwide . It third high cause cancer-related death globally . In west , disease diagnose 30 40 % patient early stage amenable potentially curative treatment , surgical therapy ( resection liver transplantation ) locoregional procedure ( radio-frequency ablation ) . There clear epidemiological study Kingdom Saudi Arabia give real incidence HCC Saudi population , however Saudi Cancer registration label among top five cancer country . Sorafenib emerge treatment choice treatment advance HCC demonstrate anti-angiogenic anti-proliferative effect . It kinase inhibitor decrease tumor cell proliferation Vitro . Sorafenib show inhibit multiple intracellular ( CRAF , BRAF , mutant BRAF ) cell surface kinase ( KIT , FLT-3 , RET , VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 PDGFR-B ) . Several kinase think involved tumor cell signal , angiogenesis apoptosis . In phase 3 international , multi-center , randomise , doubleblind , placebo-controlled trial patient unresectable hepatocellualr carcinoma Sorafenib show statistically significant advantage placebo overall survival ( HR : 0.69 , p=0.00058 ) . Final analysis time tumor progression also significantly longer Protocol number : 1.0 date 01Aug2013 Short title : HCC - Sorafenib study Confidential Page 11 The Long-Term Comprehensive National Plan Science , Technology Innovation Sorafenib arm . This benefit calculate month quick emergence resistance many patient . Therefore , individualize treatment patient expect response avoid patient resistant cancer stimulate research evaluate patient develop resistance therapy . Literature review Epidemiology Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sixth common cause cancer worldwide annual incidence 711,000 new case , third common cause cancer death annual mortality 679,000 patient . Most commonly HCC develop cirrhosis , irrespective etiology . In western world , chronic alcohol abuse nonalcoholic stratohepatitis important etiologic factor cirrhosis chronic hepatitis c. In chronic hepatitis C estimate 20 % patient eventually develop cirrhosis 20-30 year infection . Once cirrhosis establish , annual risk develop HCC estimate 3 4 % , largely irrespective etiology cirrhosis . Diagnosis HCC HCC mostly asymptomatic early stage disease . Without proper surveillance program cirrhotic patient , diagnosis establish advanced stage disease . The efficacy surveillance Ultrasound ( lesser extent alpha-fetoprotein measurement ) establish prospective trial west well east . surveillance experience sonographers make curative treatment possible treatment possible 75 % patient , curative treatment without proper surveillance . Surveillance recommend follow group patient : Hepatitis B carrier Asian male &gt; 40 year , Asian female &gt; 50 year , All cirrhotic hepatitis B carrier , Family history HCC , Africans age 20 . For non-cirrhotic hepatitis B carrier list risk HCC varies depend severity underlie liver disease , Long-Term Comprehensive National Plan Science , Technology Innovation inflammatory activity . Patients high HBV DNA concentration ongoing hepatic inflammatory activity remain risk HCC . Non-hepatitis B cirrhosis Hepatitis C , Alcoholic cirrhosis , Genetic hemochromatosis , Primary biliary cirrhosis . Although follow group increase risk HCC recommendation surveillance make lack data precludes assessment whether surveillance would beneficial - Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency , Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , Autoimmune hepatitis . Once lesion detect ultrasound , diagnosis establish radiologically lesion typical appearance 1 cm diameter . Biopsy mandate case atypical presentation imaging . Staging HCC Staging HCC do use several system . currently , widely use staging system Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stag system , take underlie liver disease , tumor characteristic , well general performance status account . This stag system popular directly link treatment , make treatment decision easy . Advanced stage HCC : current role medical therapy In western country , 30 % patient identify HCC BCLC stage 0 A , either surveillance chance . For patient curative option apply , currently involve surgical interventional treatment . However , curatively treated patient , except underwent transplantation , tumor recurrence 70 80 % case within 5 year therapy eventually progress BCLC B BCLC C stage disease . Another 20 % patient diagnose advanced stage BCLC D , either symptomatic decompensated cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh C ) advance tumor . Those patient short survival , influence therapeutic intervention eligible receive best supportive care . Currently , domain medical therapy HCC set advanced stage BCLC C. Conventional chemotherapy kind never show meaningful therapeutic benefit , particularly overall survival randomize controlled trial adult patient recommend treatment HCC today . Conventional cisplatin-based chemotherapy , Technology Innovation without doxorubicine place treatment childhood hepatoblastoma , distinctly different disease entity . In hepatoblastoma cisplatin-based chemotherapy improve survival even provide cure 80 % patient combine resection . Medical treatment HCC change dramatically 2007 , first data successful use target agent advanced stage HCC , particular tyrosine kinase inhibitor , present . Up-regulated signal mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) intracellular signal transduction pathway play crucial role development hepatocellular carcinoma , tumor angiogenesis .The MAPK pathway comprise Raf , MAPK kinase ( MEK ) extracellular signal-regulated Kinase ( ERK ) , mediator tumor proliferation , differentiation survival . The identification pivotal pathway , MAPK cascade , lead development target treatment , Sorafenib . Sorafenib orally active multikinase inhibitor inhibits cell surface tyrosine kinase , well downstream intracellular Raf kinases MAPK cascade . Sorafenib widely available use treatment advance renal cell carcinoma review indication previously . Recently , Sorafenib also approve US EU use treatment hepatocellular carcinoma , first systemic drug approve indication . Indeed , current US treatment guideline recommend Sorafenib first-lone treatment option patient unresectable HCC Child-Pugh class A. Receptor tyrosine Kinases inhibit Sorafenib include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) -B , cKIT , FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT-3 ) RET . Intracellular Raf serine/threonine kinase isoforms inhibit Sorafenib include Raf-1 ( C-Raf ) , wild -type B-Raf Mutant B-Raf . These kinase involve tumor cell proliferation tumor angiogenesis . In vitro , dose-dependent inhibition cell proliferation see Sorafenib human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line PLC/PRF/5 HepG2 . Moreover , dose dependent induction apoptosis see Sorafenib exposure , assess TUNEL ( terminal deoxynucleotide transferase d-uridine triphosphate nick end labeling ) staining . Inhibition Sorafenib Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway PCL/PRF/5 HepG2 cell show , among thing , inhibition MEK ERK phosphorylation . Sorafenib demonstrate Protocol number : 1.0 date 01Aug2013 Short title : HCC - Sorafenib study Confidential Page 14 The Long-Term Comprehensive National Plan Science , Technology Innovation dose-dependent antitumor activity murine xenograft model PCL/PRF/5 human hepatocellular carcinoma .
