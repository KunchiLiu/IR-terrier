	<detailed_description>Based real case , daily life scenario peritoneal dialysis hemodialysis patient shoot edited video film , include environment home dialysis , dietary pattern , water intake , sport mode , daily work , short time travel activity , cover certain natural day either peritoneal hemodialysis important time point way life , nurse treatment common complication correspond dialysis mode . The video also show advantage disadvantage two mode dialysis . According actual living condition , patient decide right dialysis modality suite well , thus improve dialysis compliance psychological adaptability . By `` informed decision score '' questionnaire , comparison two group patient dialysis awareness pattern ratio patient choose hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis perform . Dialysis mode conversion rate two group finally calculate correlation awareness dialysis modality conversion rate dialysis method analyze .</detailed_description>
