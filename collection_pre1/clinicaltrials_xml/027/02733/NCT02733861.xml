	<brief_summary>With development oral medicine , dental implant become popular solution remediate loss teeth dental rehabilitation . For last decade , immediate loading protocol become popular increase demand shorten treatment time . Implant stability consider one important parameter implant dentistry . It affect heal successful osseointegration implant . For implant procedure , successful implant integration prerequisite criterion , depend series procedure-related patient-dependent factor . It also consider preoperative measurement critical may give valuable information predict loading time survival implant . In clinical study , sample collect patient single teeth miss come department prosthodontics School Stomatology Fourth Military Medical University.The prospective cohort study use investigate correlation different factor early stability implant . And , use correlation different factor early implant stability give predictable data implant stability evaluate accuracy reliability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Related Factors Influencing Stability Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ethical institutional approval obtain study institution . From May 2015 May 2017 , teeth miss consecutive patient require implant treatment consent participate study investigate correlation implant stability bone density . Cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) use preoperative radiological evaluation jawbone patient , bone density Houndsfield unit scale assess SimPlant Pro 11.04 software . Immediately implant placement 12 week later , stability measurement perform Osstellâ„¢ Mentor.The capture data represent quantitative unit call Implant Stability Quotient ( ISQ ) scale 1 100 average implant . The descriptive statistical method use show differences bone density ISQ value among location , gender , age implant diameter variable . Mann-whitney test use comparison HU value ISQ value different age gender group . Kruskal-Wallis test use comparison HU value ISQ value different location implant diameter group . The change ISQ value time compare use Wilcoxon sign rank test . The Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient use investigate correlation ISQ value HU value . At last , investigate possible correlation implant stability bone density study feasibility predict implant stability use preoperative CBCT .</detailed_description>
