	<brief_summary>In order optimize symptom management , must shift fixed intervention `` one size fit '' adaptive intervention tailor individual patient . Our multistaged intervention use sequential multiple assignment randomize trial ( SMART ) design . This design operationalize decision rule switch one intervention another individual patient . Our team 's work date breast lung cancer patient show efficacy two home-based symptom management intervention , reflexology meditative practice , deliver friend family caregiver . The sustainability use two evidence base therapy improvement symptom outcomes tested week 5-8 week 12 follow 331 patient base power analysis , control group . By sequence two evidence base intervention , propose research impact research practice determine maximize benefit symptom management cancer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 , part ) , relative effectiveness reflexology meditative practice . Hypothesis 1 . Patients randomized reflexology group report low severity fatigue lower sum severity score MD Anderson symptom inventory week 1-4 . This hypothesis test use statistical model # 1 relate outcome week 1-4 group assignment variable ( reflexology , meditative practice control ) , outcome baseline , covariates ( see baseline comparison ) . Additional covariates include variable use randomization , due potential impact outcome . If error normally distribute , model fit linear mixed effect model ( LME ) , generalizes classical analysis repeat measure . Generalized linear mixed effect ( GLME ) model use appropriate link function error distribution ( e.g. , gamma ) symptom severity outcome normally distribute normalized use transformation . The investigator primarily interested additive effect group variable , difference least square ( LS ) mean test accord level variable . Aim 1 , part b ) , characteristics responder non-responders . Patients responders nonresponders fatigue define described measure . The characteristic responder caregiver compare non-responders use t-tests , chi-square Fisher 's exact test . Aim 2 , Hypothesis 2 . Patients respond reflexology fatigue week 1-4 ( 1st intervention stage ) meditative practice add week 5-8 ( 2nd intervention stage ) , report low severity fatigue improve 3 secondary outcome : sum severity index symptom , depression anxiety , compare re-randomized continue reflexology alone . The analytic strategy describe analyse Aim 1 implement comparison two group create second randomization . The repeated severity measure week 5-8 week 12 related study group ( reflexology alone versus reflexology meditative practice ) , symptom severity week 4 , covariates ( see preliminary analysis ) . The test significance coefficient group variable yield formal test Hypothesis 2 severity fatigue symptom . PROMIS measure depression anxiety obtain week 12 interview analyze use general generalize linear model , test Hypothesis 2 2 secondary outcome come significance coefficient group assignment second randomization . Aim 3 , Hypothesis 3 . Patients respond meditative practice fatigue week 1-4 ( 1st intervention stage ) reflexology add 2nd intervention stage ( week 5-8 ) , report low severity fatigue improve 3 secondary outcome : sum severity index symptom , depression anxiety compare re-randomized continue meditative practice alone . The analysis aim analysis Aim 2 , perform among notrespond meditative practice week 1-4 . Aim 4 , Hypothesis 4 : Patients randomize intervention sequence begin reflexology meditative practice report low severity fatigue improve 3 secondary outcome : sum severity symptom week 1-8 week 12 , depression anxiety week 12 compare control . The LME model describe analysis Aim 1 extend include 8 repeated measure symptom severity ( weekly call ) additional measure week 12 interview . The test significance explanatory variable reflect result first randomization yield formal test Hypothesis 4 . PROMIS depression anxiety measure week 12 interview analyze use generalize linear model follow explanatory variable : group assignment first randomization , depression anxiety ( respectively ) baseline , balance variable randomization . Exploratory Analysis : Aim 5 . To explore dyadic characteristic observed week 1-4 associate optimal patient symptom outcomes week 5-8 week 12 , determine additional tailoring variable decision rule select first intervention stage switch first intervention stage second . The analysis aim help build optimal intervention sequence determine optimal decision rule specify best first second intervention stage . This determination simple determine best intervention stage ignore future intervention . Such simplistic approach would ignore longer-term effect intervention inferior stage 1 , produce good outcomes long term simply continue versus combine another intervention .</detailed_description>
