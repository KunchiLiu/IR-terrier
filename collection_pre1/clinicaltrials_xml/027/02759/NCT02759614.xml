	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , control , multicenter , Phase III study . Patients randomly assign treatment group ( 1:1 ) dynamic randomization process use follow stratification factor : sex ( female/male ) , disease stage ( stage IIIb vs. stage IV vs. recurrence ) , EGFR gene mutation ( exon 19 deletion vs. exon 21 L858R ) . An independent review committee ( IRC ) use determine response base study endpoint . IRC membership procedure detail IRC charter . A data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) use study . DSMB independent body responsible review safety data study . DSMB membership procedure detail separate DSMB document . Information regard nature duration subsequent treatment collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion study entry : 1 . Signed Informed Consent Form . 2 . Age≥18 year . 3 . Able comply study protocol , investigator 's judgment . 4 . Histologically cytologically document inoperable , locally advanced ( Stage IIIb amenable combined modality treatment ) , metastatic ( Stage IV ) recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC . Diagnoses nonsquamous NSCLC base sputum cytology alone acceptable . 5 . An exon 19 deletion mutation exon 21 L858R mutation find highsensitivity EGFR mutation test PCR use tumor tissue centrally confirm . Direct sequencing accept . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 01 . 7 . Life expectancy≥12 week . 8 . Previous systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy locally advance , metastatic recurrent disease perform . Subjects undergone intracavity administration antineoplastic agent pleurodesis permit . For patient undergone pre postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy , least 6 month elapse since final administration date . 9 . Patients undergone radiotherapy may enrol meet following condition : The patient history radiotherapy lesion lung field within 28 day randomization . For radiotherapy outside chest region , least 28 day elapse time randomization since final irradiation date . ( radiotherapy give palliation bone metastasis within 2 week , patient recovery toxicity ) 10 . Measurable disease baseline . At least one lesion present measure accordance criterion Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Version 1.1 . However , site treat radiotherapy consider measurable . 11 . Adequate haematological function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5×109/L AND Platelet count≥100×109/L AND Haemoglobin≥9 g/dL ( may transfuse maintain exceed level ) 12 . Adequate liver function . Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5×upper limit normal ( ULN ) AND Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5×ULN patient without liver metastasis ; &lt; 5×ULN patient liver metastasis 13 . Adequate renal function Serum creatinine≤1.5×ULN calculate creatinine clearance≧45mL/min AND Urine dipstick proteinuria &lt; 2+ . Patients discover ≥2+ proteinuria dipstick urinalysis baseline undergo 24hour urine collection must demonstrate≤1 g protein 24 hour . 14. International normalise ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 partial prothrombin time ( PTT aPTT ) ≤1.5×ULN within 7 day prior randomization . 15 . For woman postmenopausal ( ≥12 month nontherapyinduced amenorrhea ) surgically sterile ( absence ovary and/or uterus ) : agreement remain abstinent use single combine contraceptive method result failure rate &lt; 1 % per year treatment period least 6 month last dose study drug . 16 . For men : agreement remain abstinent use condom plus additional contraceptive method together result failure rate &lt; 1 % per year treatment period least 6 month last dose study drug agreement refrain donate sperm period . Patients meet follow criterion exclude study entry : 1 . Mixed adenosquamous carcinoma predominantly squamous component . 2 . A positive result exon 20 T790M mutation highsensitivity EGFR mutation test digital PCR use tumor tissue cell . 3 . Evidence CNS metastasis , except patient without symptom patient symptom stable disease least 28 day treatment CNS metastases . 4 . History haemoptysis , define &gt; 2.5 ml red blood per event within 3 month prior randomization . 5 . Evidence tumour invade major blood vessel image . The investigator local radiologist must exclude evidence tumour fully contiguous , surround , extend lumen major blood vessel ( e.g. , pulmonary artery superior vena cava ) . 6 . Major surgery ( include open biopsy ) significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior randomization anticipation need major surgery study treatment . 7 . Core biopsy minor surgical procedure , exclude placement vascular access device exclude within 7 day prior initiation study treatment . Placement vascular access device least 2 day prior initiation study treatment . 8 . Current recent ( within 10 day first dose bevacizumab ) use aspirin ( 325 mg/day ) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent know inhibit platelet function . 9 . Current recent ( within 10 day first dose bevacizumab ) use fulldose oral parenteral anticoagulant thrombolytic agent therapeutic purpose . Prophylactic use anticoagulant allow . 10 . History evidence inherit bleed diathesis coagulopathy increase risk bleed . 11 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure : systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg ) . 12 . Prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy . 13 . Clinically significant ( i.e. , active ) cardiovascular disease , include limited cerebral vascular accident ( CVA ) ( transient ischemic attack ) TIA ( ≤6 month randomization ) , myocardial infarction ( ≤6 month randomization ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class≥II , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication study might interfere regularity study treatment control medication . 14 . Significant vascular disease ( include limit aortic aneurysm require surgical repair recent arterial thrombosis ) within 6 month prior randomization . 15 . Nonhealing wound , active peptic ulcer , bone fracture . 16 . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month enrollment . 17 . Pregnant lactating , intend become pregnant study . 18 . Treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial within 28 day prior randomization . 19 . Known hypersensitivity bevacizumab Chinese hamster ovary cell product recombinant human humanise antibody erlotinib excipients . 20 . Evidence ongoing active infection require IV antibiotic ; disease , neurological , metabolic dysfunction ; physical examination find laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug put patient high risk treatmentrelated complication . 21 . Patients diagnose tracheooesophageal fistula . 22 . Prior chemotherapy treatment another systemic anticancer agent ( e.g. , monoclonal antibody , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , EGFR inhibitor , VEGF receptor inhibitor ) treatment patient 's current stage disease ( Stage IIIB amenable combined modality treatment , Stage IV postoperative recurrent disease ) . NOTE : . Previous adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment nonmetastatic disease permit complete ≥ 6 month randomization . 23 . Lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract , malabsorption syndrome , inability take oral medication , active gastroduodenal ulcer disease . 24 . Any inflammatory change surface eye ( e.g . : severe dry eye syndrome , keratoconjunctivitis , keratitis etc . ) disorder likely increase risk corneal epithelial lesion .
