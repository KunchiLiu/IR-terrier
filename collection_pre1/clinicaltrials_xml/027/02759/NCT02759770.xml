	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome follow cardiac surgery severely affect prognosis patient ; mortality 40 % . Although experience many year research exploration , effective method treatment acute respiratory distress syndrome still relatively limited present , include lung protective mechanical ventilation respiratory support , fluid management , glucocorticoid integrate organ function maintenance measure . It currently research acute respiratory distress syndrome aim early discovery take effective measure prevent occurrence , hop improve prognosis patient . According risk factor establish analysis lung injury score early warning system , early identification acute respiratory distress syndrome patient high risk , occurrence acute respiratory distress syndrome take correspond preventive measure effectively reduce incidence rate mortality . So far , domestic foreign research establishment acute respiratory distress syndrome score early warning system less . Cardiac surgery significant characteristic , type operation , location , operation , intraoperative blood transfusion oxygenation , postoperative factor , likely factor acute respiratory distress syndrome . As far investigator know , far specialized acute respiratory distress syndrome predict lung injury cardiac surgery . This study complete implementation individualize dynamic lung injury score evaluation cardiac surgery patient , identification high-risk acute respiratory distress syndrome patient , assist clinician early decision , take preventive measure . This study improve prognosis acute respiratory distress syndrome patient cardiac surgery ; great significance improve level intensive care cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
