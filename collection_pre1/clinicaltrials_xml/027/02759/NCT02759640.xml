	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial HS-10241 Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , c-Met become important target intensive research search specific inhibitor potential new therapy cancer driven c-Met activation . HS-10241 potent selective small molecule c-Met kinase inhibitor enzyme c-Met phosphorylation cell . Consistent potent enzyme cell activity , HS-10241 find inhibit cell growth vitro tumor c-Met gene amplification c-Met overexpression . On basis finding , current trial conduct participant advance solid tumor standard treatment currently available . This study consist 2 phase . In dose-escalation phase , 5 dose level HS-10241 ( 100 mg/day , 200 mg/day , 340 mg/day , 500 mg/day , 700 mg/day ) investigate sequential `` 3+3 '' design ( 3 6 participant every dose level ) . Participants single-dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) run-in period ( 7 day ) . Following first dose , participant enter 1 week treatment-free period evaluate safety single-dose PK . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) observe 1-week period , HS-10241 administration resume dose level . In expansion phase , 12 additional participant enrol MTD . Anti-tumor effect assess every 2 cycle ( 4 weeks=1 cycle ) use RECIST version 1.1 criterion .</detailed_description>
