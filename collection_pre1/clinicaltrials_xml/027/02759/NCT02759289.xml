	<detailed_description>Patients prediabetes elevate risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) also lead cause morbidity mortality patient Type 2 Diabetes . There remain unmet clinical need identify modifiable risk factor CVD patient disorder glucose homeostasis , include prediabetes T2D . Exposure inorganic arsenic environmental toxicant may novel target CVD risk reduction patient . However , clinical study environmental exposure vascular function thrombotic risk among patient prediabetes grow understanding environmental exposure modifiable risk factor CVD , impact : ( 1 ) describing role environmental exposures patient risk T2D ; ( 2 ) identify T2D patient high risk adverse biological effect environmental exposure ; ( 3 ) inform health policy treatment pathways reduce risk exposure . Investigators evaluate association inorganic arsenic exposure measure vascular function , estimate association inorganic arsenic exposure measure thrombotic risk explore independent association environmental exposure inorganic arsenic measure vascular function thrombotic risk .</detailed_description>
