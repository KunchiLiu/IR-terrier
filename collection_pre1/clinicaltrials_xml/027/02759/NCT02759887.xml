	<brief_summary>In order treat individual Down syndrome ( DS ) well efficiently gain insight relation Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , comprehensive understanding need progression early preclinical phase use various biomarkers . DS significant risk factor early development AD , plaques tangle typically develop age 35 . A good understanding need early marker disease DS patient . Additionally DS population represent unique group - due elevate risk AD - examine biomarkers may translate general outside DS population individual risk develop late onset AD . In proposal , researcher assess longitudinal change various biomarkers cohort individual similar design cross-sectional sectional study preliminary data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Between Down Syndrome ( DS ) Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruit three experimental group : ( 1 ) The DS ( adult ) group consist 15 DS subject age 21 old qualify diagnosis dementia begin study . ( 2 ) The DS/AD group consist 15 DS subject age 40 old qualify diagnosis dementia Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) criterion . Diagnoses standard consensus review case . ( 3 ) Normal control ( NC ) adult consist 10 cognitively normal , non-DS individual , age-matched DS group . Blood collect assess apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) genotype . Participation dry blood spot collection ( DBSC ) optional sub-study . Only participant and/or caregivers/legally authorize representative indicate wish DBSC perform consent provide specimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion NonAD/DS subject : Subjects free Trisomy 21 . Male female subject 21 year age old . Subjects diagnose possible probable AD dementia evaluation NINCDSADRDA ( National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ) criterion . Subjects live regular visit responsible caregiver willing provide information subject 's cognitive status . If subject incapable give informed consent , caregiver may consent behalf subject ( subject must still confirm assent ) . Inclusion criterion AD/DS subject : Subjects free Trisomy 21 . Male female subject 40 old year age . Subjects diagnose possible probable use NINCDSADRDA criterion . Subjects live regular visit responsible caregiver willing provide information subject 's cognitive status . If subject incapable give informed consent , caregiver may consent behalf subject ( subject must still confirm assent ) . Inclusion criterion Normal Controls Cognitively normal , nonDS individual . Agematched DS group . Subjects sign Institutional Review Boardapproved inform consent . ( group ) Previous current diagnosis neurodegenerative disorder AD DS , include , limited Parkinson 's disease , Pick 's disease , frontotemporal dementia , Huntington 's chorea , CreutzfeldtJacob disease , normal pressure hydrocephalus , progressive supranuclear palsy . Previous current diagnosis dementing/neurodegenerative disease ( e.g . Parkinson 's disease dementia , dementia Lewy body , Lewy body variant AD ) . Previous current diagnosis mixed dementia . Previous current diagnosis cognitive impairment result know etiology . Previous current diagnosis clinically significant infarct possible multiinfarct dementia define National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke/Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neuroscience ( NINDSAIREN ) criterion . Previous current evidence screening MRI , compute tomography ( CT ) , biomarker study suggest alternate etiology ( probable AD patient AD ) cognitive deficit ; case nonAD control evidence screen MRI , CT , biomarker study suggest presence AD pathology . Brain amyloidβ peptide ( Aβ ) Amyloid imaging/PET imaging , however , expect many nonAD/DS AD/DS subject , ground exclusion . Previous current clinically significant psychiatric disease , judge Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition ( DSMIV ) criterion , particularly current major depression schizophrenia . Patients dementia experience behavioral disturbance may require treatment psychotropic medication may enter discussion approval principal investigator . The investigator carefully consider whether subject behavioral dysfunction able complete imaging session . Previous current history epilepsy convulsion , except febrile convulsion childhood . Current clinically significant hepatic , renal , pulmonary , metabolic , endocrine disturbance . Current clinically significant cardiovascular disease . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease usually include one following : ) cardiac surgery myocardial infarction within last 6 month ; b ) unstable angina ; c ) coronary artery disease required increase medication within last 3 month ; ) decompensated congestive heart failure ; e ) significant cardiac arrhythmia conduction disturbance , particularly result trial ventricular fibrillation , cause syncope , near syncope , alteration mental status ; f ) severe mitral aortic valvular disease ; g ) uncontrolled high blood pressure ; h ) congenital heart disease ) . Current history drug alcohol abuse within last year , prior prolonged history abuse . Current clinically significant infectious disease , include know Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection previous positive test hepatitis . Women childbearing potential surgically sterile , refrain sexual activity , use reliable method contraception . Women childbearing potential must pregnant ( negative serum betahCG [ human chorionic gonadotropin ] time screen negative urine betahCG day image ) lactate screen . Women must avoid become pregnant , must agree refrain sexual activity use reliable contraceptive method 30 day prior 30 day administration radiopharmaceutical image agent study . In order participate study , sexually active female must either : two year postmenopausal surgically sterilize , must use acceptable form contraception ( oral contraceptive least three month IUD ( intrauterine device ) least two month prior start screen visit , various barrier method , e.g. , diaphragm combination condom spermicide ) . Subjects , opinion research team , otherwise unsuitable study type . Subjects history relevant severe drug allergy hypersensitivity . Subjects received investigational medication within last 30 day . Additionally , time last dose previous experimental medication enrollment ( completion screen assessment ) must least equal 5 time terminal halflife previous experimental medication . Subjects ever participate experimental study amyloid target therapy ( e.g. , immunotherapy , secretase inhibitor ) may enrol unless demonstrated subject receive placebo course trial . Current clinically significant medical comorbidities , indicate history , physical exam , laboratory evaluation , might pose potential safety risk , interfere absorption metabolism study medication , limit interpretation trial result . These include limited clinically significant hepatic , renal , pulmonary , metabolic endocrine disease , cancer . Subjects received radiopharmaceutical imaging therapy within past 7 day prior image session study .</criteria>
