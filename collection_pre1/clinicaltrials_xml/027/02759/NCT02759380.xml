	<brief_title>Can Dietary Phytoestrogens Slow Down Prostate Tumor Proliferation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data ecologic experimental study clearly show protective effect dietary phytoestrogens prostate cancer . Genetic factor also etiologic importance prostate cancer grow evidence importance gene-diet interaction prostate cancer progression . The investigator recently find putative genetic interaction protective role phytoestrogens . The overall decreased risk prostate cancer men high intake phytoestrogens strongly modify nucleotide sequence variant estrogen receptor-beta ( ERß ) gene . An American study find similar interactive effect intake phytoestrogens , well body mass index ( BMI ) , another nucleotide sequence variant ERß.The phytoestrogens isoflavonoids coumestans bind tightly estrogen receptor-beta ( ERß ) mainly find soy bean . ERß expression find involved progression prostate cancer , suggest phytoestrogens may interact ERß development prostate cancer . With regard potential carcinogenic mechanism , phytoestrogens may involve endocrine control prostate cell growth influence balance AR ERß.Testosterone metabolite 5α-dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) cause proliferation prostate epithelial cell bind AR . In contrast , bind ERß , 5α androstane-3ß,17ß-diol ( 3ßAdiol ) , metabolite DHT , repress expression AR thereby inhibit androgen-driven proliferation promote cell differentiation . In term proliferation , current data suggests combine stimulatory role ERα AR prostate whereas ERß inhibit proliferation stimulates differentiation . Both estrogen ERα ß affinity estradiol whereas phytoestrogens 3ßAdiol selectively activate ERß . Phytoestrogens , result , able restrict cancer growth act substitute 3ßAdiol . This confirm experimental study . Results previous intervention study give promising result indicate certain dietary lifestyle modification influence progression prostate cancer , although study fairly short duration base relatively small number patient . For example , randomise study show men give dietary addition flaxseed low percentage positive cell contain proliferation marker Ki-67 men receive addition diet . Taken together , present evidence point towards possibility prostate cancer patient complement lifestyle-related treatment alternative prevent delay tumor progression . Specific aim : To perform control randomized dietary intervention study men prostate cancer . The investigator pursue follow specific aims/hypothesis : 1 . `` Among men prostate cancer intermediate risk-level , diet high phytoestrogens reduce tumor progression compare men diet low phytoestrogens '' . 2 . `` The effect diet high phytoestrogens prostate cancer tumor progression differ men different genotype polymorphisms ERß gene '' . The men divide two subgroup , bear TT TC/CC allele , single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs2987983-13950 T/C ERß-gene , hypothesis test . 3 . To determine whether RNA expression AR , ERα ERβ prostate tumor tissue , well level steroid hormone , differs men diet high low phytoestrogens , respectively , different genotype ERβ gene . 4 . To determine whether Cyclic citrullinated peptide ( CCP ) gene expression prostate tumor tissue differs men diet high low phytoestrogens , respectively , different genotype ERβ gene . Study protocol : Trough treat physician , investigator identify 240 men Västra Götaland healthcare region diagnose prostate cancer intermediate risk-level ( T1-T2 , Gleason score &lt; 8 , PSA &lt; 20 ) schedule radical prostatectomy . The clinic inform patient enrol study , surgery patient schedule six week ahead time date inclusion . Once patient agree participate , randomize one two intervention arm . The patient receive additional information depend group belongs ask donate blood sample . Under normal clinical routine , data prostate cancer case collect National Prostate Cancer Register ( NPCR ) , example information Gleason score , tumor volume , Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level . The investigator collect information registry connection analysis data . Intervention : Patients introduce intervention diet dietitian receive general information healthy food choice ( accord recommendation general public ) eat dietary supplement , dietary restriction give . The patient give package contain food high amount phytoestrogens ( ≥100 mg isoflavonoids ≥100 mg lignans ) consume daily . The intervention continue day surgery ( least 6 week ) . The patient control group inform way intervention group except receive food-package . Endpoint : The effect diet tumor proliferation rate measure make comparison 1 ) percentage positive cell contain marker Ki-67 , 2 ) PSA-levels , 3 ) CCP-score two group . Tumor tissue prostate biopsy take surgery ( end study ) recent biopsy take begin study collect . Blood sample take begin study , day surgery , 3 month surgery , send analysis PSA ( free total ) . The absolute difference PSA level PSA double time calculate . In addition investigator measure expression AR , ERα ERß tumor tissue blood level hormone , testosterone , DHT , estradiol 3ß-Adiol . Questionnaire : All patient answer password-protected questionnaire baseline , surgery , 3 month , weight height measure . Once 6-weeks period 24-h recall interview perform , participant food intake precede 24 h register . The individual intake energy specific nutrient estimate link information questionnaire diet record National Food Agency 's nutritional database previously develop phytoestrogen database . Analysis polymorph : SNP ERß-gene analyse blood sample , use PCR-based method competitive allele specific PCR ( KASP™ ) . The allele-constitution identify participant assign group TT , TC CC . Analysis Ki-67 : The biopsy sample fix immersion 4 % paraformaldehyde 0,1 M phosphate buffer 24hours +4°C . Then dehydrate grade ethanol follow xylene paraffin embed . Paraffin section heat 30 minute 60ºC , pre-treated citric acid buffer . Unspecific bind block donkey serum phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) contain Triton X-100 30 minute . Incubating Ki-67 antibody night ( 4ºC ) follow incubation appropriate secondary biotinylated antibody . To enhance signal , section treat avidin-biotin-complex solution , visualize immunoreactivity Diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) use . Stained tumor cell ( Ki-67 positivity ) count result report ratio positive nucleus divide total number evaluate × 100 . Analysis receptor-expression , CCP score , hormone level PSA : Tissue sample take surgery place RNA-later frozen . The sample analyse use RNeasy plus Universal Mini Kits ( QIAGEN ) , Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . ERα , ERβ AR mRNA expression determine use TaqMan assay . For analysis CCP score , pathologist select region carcinoma RNA extract ; thereafter gene expression assess accord manufacture ( Prolaris® ) instruction . PSA-blood level analyse accord standard clinical protocol . Power calculation : In Västra Götaland healthcare region 2012 , 321 men intermediate risk-level prostate cancer receive curative treatment . Calculation use primary outcome ( Ki-67 ) give study group consist 118 patient 80 % power two-sided test level significance 0,05 effect size 0,5 . The investigator find early study approximately 42 % male population heterozygous homozygous variant allele ( TC/CC ) ERβ promoter region SNP ( rs2987983-13950 T/C ) 58 % homozygous wild type allele ( TT ) . Since investigator expect effect intervention great among subject variant allele , small among subject wild type allele , latter group ought large enough able find difference one exist . Thus total sample size 118/58 % =203 patient need . Statistical Considerations : The investigator utilize intention-to-treat method . In design data collection test drug template make ( randomization , placebo , blinding , attrition , differential measuring error , correct analysis ) ; deviation perfect situation investigator use epidemiological theory guide analysis interpret result . Preliminary analysis , base mean , median , standard deviation interquantile range provide properly describe outcome interest stratification perform assess performance randomization assign diet . Box-plots therefore produce graphically evaluate temporal trend response . The distribution outcomes studied appropriate transformation apply , need , improve symmetry normality . Due longitudinal structure data , correlation among observation incorporate linear mixed effect model carry study ( ) temporal trend ( ii ) linear trend differs treat untreated individual ( iii ) treatment effect intervention group control group modify accord ERß genotype , common variant . A key step analysis longitudinal data identify appropriate covariance structure describes correlation among data point : independent covariance ( correlation ) , exchangeable covariance ( equal correlation ) autoregressive covariance correlation responses decrease time measurement . The investigator identify appropriate structure , verify empirically help information theoretic approach . Both statistical test confidence interval produce assess significance effect , partial F test procedure therefore use study join effect main interaction variable appropriate statistical method apply study model fitting .</detailed_description>
