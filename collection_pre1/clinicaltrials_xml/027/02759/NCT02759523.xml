	<brief_summary>Increased portion size food high energy density ( calorie per gram food ) implicate obesity epidemic . Numerous study show child adult eat large portion food small portion , response know portion size effect . Despite robust consistent nature finding , mechanism underlie portion size effect know . The long-term goal research identify neural mechanism involve portion size effect information use develop effective weight-management strategy . Differences neural response food cue , demonstrate functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , help clarify factor determine susceptibility large portion . The goal study identify brain region activate response portion size energy density relate neural response laboratory eat behavior child . The investigator hypothesize high relative low energy density food image associate increased activation region brain involve reward- sensory- processing large relative small portion size food image associate increased activation region brain involved cognitive control . In addition , investigator hypothesize brain response influence relationship portion size serve energy intake laboratory meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>What study add literature : The response food image vary portion size use fMRI previously report . Furthermore , brain response food portion size energy density relate energy intake previously report . The goal study identify brain region activate response portion size energy density relate neural response laboratory eat behavior child .</detailed_description>
