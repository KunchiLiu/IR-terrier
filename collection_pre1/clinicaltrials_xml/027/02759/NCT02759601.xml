	<brief_summary>This study carry assess best dose new drug , call tefinostat , treat liver cancer . Tefinostat new drug block enzymes call histone deacetylases ( pronounced dee-as-et-isle-azes ) . Cells need enzymes grow divide . Blocking may stop cancer grow . Drugs block enzyme call histone deacetylase inhibitor 'HDAC inhibitor ' . Tefinostat never give patient liver cancer n't know dose best treat liver cancer . To find test one dose safe test high dose . Eventually find best dose ; know . When find best dose treat another 39 patient dose . The aim study find best dose tefinostat without cause side effect . We look closely side effect might experience treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Trial Tefinostat Cancer Associated Inflamation Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , dose escalating , phase I/II study Tefinostat administer orally , twice daily 28 day cycle treatment patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma . The start dose Phase I dose escalation stage study base result previous Phase I trial Tefinostat patient haematological malignancy . The start dose Tefinostat 360mg OD . As Tefinostat median plasma half-life 0.47h ( range 0.19 1.18 ) CHR-2847 median half-life 1.4 h ( range 0.98 3.79 ) twice daily dose also investigate , start 240mg BID . Phase I Up 5 cohort 3-6 patient treat 28 day twice daily ( 360 , 480mg daily , 240 , 360 , 480mg twice daily ) determine safety tolerability Tefinostat identify recommend dose Phase II ( RP2D ) . Patients stable disease tumour response allow continue treatment PD unacceptable toxicity , discretion Investigator . Patients advance HCC receive prior systemic therapy eligible study Child-Pugh classification A candidate surgical treatment , adequate bone marrow , hepatic renal function . Patients history organ allograft serious concurrent illness . Doses increase stepwise fashion decision make participate Investigators basis DLT , PK PD . The start dose 360mg od . Should dose safe dose level may reduce 240mg od . Dosing initially take place day , 28 day , later cohort investigate twice daily dose . More one DLT daily dose cohort preclude investigation twice daily dose low dose . Decisions escalate next dose level , make jointly participate Investigators base review available data first cycle treatment patient cohort . The first subject must complete 7 day course treatment next two subject enrol . All subject treat cohort must undergo repeat safety evaluation prior enrolment next dose cohort . If subject withdraw withdrawn study prior completion first treatment period , absence DLT , subject must replace replacement patient dose schedule dose , complete , dose escalation occur . Upon completion first treatment period 28 day ( dose finding , Phase I ) , suitable patient may continue treatment described Duration Treatment , discretion investigator . The available clinical safety information trial well previous single agent study Tefinostat review participate investigator , agree RP2D . The Phase I data review participating investigator prior progress Phase II . Patients treat recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) select Phase I , 84 day course treatment . Approximately 39 patient advanced HCC treat . Patients stable disease tumour response 84 day treatment period allow continue treatment PD unacceptable toxicity , discretion treat investigator . Patient recruitment continue approximately 40 patient treated RP2D , include already treat dose Phase 1 , evaluable response follow treatment least 84 day study therapy .</detailed_description>
