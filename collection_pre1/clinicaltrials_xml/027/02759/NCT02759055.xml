	<detailed_description>Nearly one three adult rural community prediabetes , condition increase risk heart attack stroke manage use metformin , lifestyle intervention , control major cardiovascular ( CV ) risk factor . However , current prediabetes care characterize : ( ) delay recognition prediabetes ; ( b ) patient unawareness effective treatment option prediabetes ; ( c ) poor control concomitant major CV risk factor ; ( ) low rate metformin initiation ; ( e ) low rate follow assess ongoing effectiveness prediabetes management.1-3 Increased use electronic health record ( EHR ) rural community provide new opportunity improve awareness management prediabetes reduce patient ' significant CV risk burden . In project , implement evaluate EHR-linked , Web-based clinical decision support ( CDS ) system identify patient prediabetes provide patient primary care provider personalize , evidence-based CDS follow reduce risk heart attack stroke . To accomplish objective , randomly allocate 30 primary care clinic 450 primary care provider estimate 17,000 prediabetes patient one two intervention arm : Usual Care ; else prediabetes CDS optimize management follow prediabetes patient uncontrolled CV risk factor . Random-effects model ass intervention impact : ( ) American College Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) pool CV risk ; ( b ) major CV risk factor ( blood pressure , lipid , HbA1c , smoking , BMI ) ; ( c ) use evidence-based drug , include metformin , lifestyle intervention manage prediabetes ; ( ) patient provider satisfaction intervention strategy . We also conduct state-of-the-art cost cost-effectiveness analysis intervention relative usual care . The Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) framework , supplement Consolidated Framework Implementation Research ( CFIR ) , use assess implementation process outcomes rural/urban health system . The result project provide template implementation personalize CDS tool rural urban health setting , result efficient effective rural healthcare broadly apply across many clinical domain , incorporate patient treatment preference , potential substantially improve quality CV care clinical outcome million Americans prediabetes reside medically underserved area .</detailed_description>
