	<brief_summary>Background : Some non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) mutation gene make protein call EGFR . This particular cancer treat certain drug Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) , Gefitinib ( Iressa ) Osimertinib ( Tagrisso ) . But many tumor become resistant drug second mutation . Researchers want test add local ablative therapy ( LAT ) extend benefit drug , Osimertinib . LAT include technique surgery , radiofrequency ablation , cryotherapy radiation therapy . Objective : To test re-taking osimertinib LAT safe , tolerable , effective people whose NSCLC progress initial treatment osimertinib . Eligibility : Adults age 18 old certain type NSCLC . Participants divide various group describe . Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood , urine , heart test Tumor scan Eye exam Review tumor sample . Participants take study drug mouth day . They continue long tolerate disease worsens . They keep dosage diary . All participant start 21-day course physical exam ; blood , urine , saliva test ; electrocardiogram . They scan every 6 week echocardiogram every 3 month . Groups 1 2 : Start osimertinib right away . Have LAT disease get bad suitable LAT . If LAT perform LAT consist procedure surgery , tumor biopsy perform . Re-start osimertinib LAT , treatment suitable LAT . Group 3 : Have LAT . If LAT consist procedure surgery , tumor biopsy perform . Start osimertinib LAT . After participant stop take drug , final visit . This include : Medical history Physical exam Heart blood test Participants call every year follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) significantly improve response rate ( RR ) survival patient tumor harbor EGFR-sensitizing mutation . - An invariable consequence treatment EGFR-TKIs development acquire resistance . The common mechanism resistance observe approximately 50 % case emergence secondary mutation ( T790M ) exon 20 . - Osimertinib third-generation EGFR-TKI design target T790M mutation , show impressive response first- second-line setting . - Despite development , almost certain selection pressure lead emergence new clone resistant treatment osimertinib . In fact , newly identify EGFR mutation ( C797S ) result acquire resistance osimertinib report recently . - The use local ablative therapy patient develop limited metastatic disease oligoprogressive disease ) EGFR-TKI therapy promising . - We hypothesize follow local ablative therapy treat oligoprogressive disease emergence resistance AZD9291 , osimertinib resume safely reinitiation osimertinib result additional progression-free survival benefit . Objectives : - Determine safety , tolerability , efficacy ( assessed PFS ) re-initiation osimertinib follow local ablative therapy ( LAT ) patient oligoprogressive disease treatment osimertinib - Assess mechanism acquire resistance osimertinib Eligibility : - Histologically confirm advanced lung adenocarcinoma EGFR-sensitizing somatic mutation germline T790M mutation prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy progressive disease 1st 2nd generation EGFR TKI therapy harbor somatic T790M mutation patient progressive disease treatment osimertinib eligible local ablative therapy . - Presence measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 - ECOG performance status 0-2 - Adequate end organ function - If patient eligible LAT , refer standard care chemotherapy per treat physician discretion . These patient may also consider clinical trial . Design : - This single-arm , single-institution , open-label phase II trial osimertinib . - Eligible patient previously treat osimertinib treat osimertinib daily disease progression . At time progression , patient oligoprogressive disease ( 5 site progressive disease ) assess LAT . - If patient eligible LAT , osimertinib resume LAT follow second progression osimertinib ( PFS2 ) . - If patient progress site LAT perform , progression consider result inadequate ablation consider repeat LAT re-challenged osimertinib clinically feasible . - Tumor sample obtain baseline mandatory biopsy . At time first progression osimertinib patient eligible surgery form LAT , tissue sample obtain genomic proteomic study identify mechanism acquire resistance . For patient eligible LAT form LAT surgery ( radiation , radiofrequency ablation , cryoablation ) , mandatory biopsy perform , clinically safe , obtain tissue study .</detailed_description>
