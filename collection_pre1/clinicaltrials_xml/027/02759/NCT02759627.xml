	<brief_summary>Stroke one major cause morbidity mortality lead cause disability adult around world . Stroke survivor suffer several neurological impairment deficit important impact patient 's quality life increase cost health social service . After stroke , impairment ADLs functional status , deterioration health relate quality life see . Although stroke survivor experience level neurological recovery , nearly 50 % -60 % stroke patient still experience degree motor impairment , approximately 50 % least partly dependent activities-of-daily-living ( ADL ) . Gait recovery , perform activity daily live regain independence ADLs main focus stroke rehabilitation program . Robotic technology become promise technique locomotor train stroke patient . Achieving functional walk level one target robotic gait train show Robotic-Assisted Gait Training ( RAGT ) improve walk function stroke patient . Having functional gait level may help stroke patient regain independence ADLs improve quality life . The purpose present study investigate effect RAGT functional status , ADLs health relate quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Isolated Robotic-Assisted Gait Training Improve Functional Status , Daily Living And Quality Of Life In Stroke ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Our study design randomize single-blind control study 6 week include inpatient ambulatory subacute chronic stroke patient . Sample size calculate Raosoft , Inc. Clinically meaningful difference consider 20 % outcome measure . The original sample size estimate 45 patient detect statistically significant difference group . Considering drop-out , fifty-one patient include . The patient randomly assign one three train group researcher ( ARO ) use function Microsoft Office Excel software . In randomized-controlled study , eighty patient assess term eligibility criterion , 51 patient include study . The patient evaluate two physiatrists Istanbul Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Education Research Hospital refer Physiotherapy Rehabilitation Unit hospital . Enrollment period November 2014 December 2015 . Blinding : During consent process , participant advise would randomize one three intervention group . To minimize exposure group , Robot-Assisted Gait Training Conventional Training program administer different section rehabilitation center . The 2 trial physiotherapist could blind intervention group . All treatment schedule plan another researcher . All outcome assessment conduct blind assessor locate offsite . Trial staff instruct participant avoid mention anything intervention assessor . Patients ask shear information treatment .</detailed_description>
