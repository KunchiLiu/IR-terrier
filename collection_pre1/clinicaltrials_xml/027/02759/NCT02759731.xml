	<brief_summary>Background : Chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) affect people hematopoietic stem cell transplant use donor cell . It often fatal . It usually treat high dos steroid . But help half people long term . Researchers want see drug call baricitinib help people cGVHD responded therapy . The drug inhibit protein involve communication immune system . These protein may play role cGVHD inflammatory disease . Objectives : To test safety effectiveness baricitinib people cGVHD responded therapy . Eligibility : Adults 18 old cGVHD respond therapy . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They lung heart test chest scan . Baseline visit : Participants : Medical history Physical exam Blood test Tests infectious disease Skin , eye , teeth evaluation Rehabilitation occupational medicine evaluation Photos lesion Gynecology evaluation ( female ) The study occur 28-day cycle . Participants take study drug mouth every day 3 cycle . Some take 3 6 cycle . Participants visits cycle . They repeat previous test . They may also scan questionnaire . Participants visit stop take drug another 3 month later . They repeat study test . They follow-up call 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Baricitinib , JAK1/2 Inhibitor , Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Background : - Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) lead cause non-relapse morbidity mortality person allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . - Approximately 50 % patient cGVHD disease refractory systemic corticosteroid ; currently , standard second-line therapy . - The JAK-STAT pathway relay signal function several inflammatory cytokine role GVHD ( IFN-gamma , IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-12 ) . - Murine model demonstrate activity JAK inhibitor graft-versus-host disease . - Baricitinib potent selective inhibitor JAK1 JAK2 demonstrate anti-inflammatory effect good safety profile patient rheumatoid arthritis , evaluate GVHD . - Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability baricitinib patient cGVHD refractory steroid - To determine efficacy baricitinib patient cGVHD refractory steroid - Eligibility : - Inclusion : - Age great equal 18 year - Moderate severe cGVHD per NIH consensus criterion - Karnofsky performance status great equal 50 % - cGVHD respond high-dose corticosteroid ( prednisone 1.0 mg/kg/day least 1 week prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day 1 mg/kg every day least 4 week ) , second-line therapy ( ) - Receiving stable tapering dos systemic therapy precede 4 week take systemic therapy cGVHD - Exclusion : - Neutrophils &lt; 1.0x10^9/L , platelet &lt; 50X10^9/L , creatinine great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 50mL/min/1.73m^2 ( Cockroft-Gault formula ) , serum aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase concentration &gt; 3x ULN total bilirubin great equal 1.5x ULN - Progressive malignancy , uncontrolled infection major organ dysfunction define protocol - Design : - This Phase 1/2 trial determine safety efficacy baricitinib patient cGVHD refractory steroid . - Patients initially treat baricitinib 2mg daily 12 week . If response 12 week CR DLT , dose remain 2mg daily additional 12 week , primary response assessment 24 week total treatment . If response PR stable disease , dose increase 4mg daily additional 12 week , primary response assessment 24 week total treatment . If progression disease time within first 12 week , dose increased 4mg daily time , patient continue total 24 week treatment . Patients option continue baricitinib additional 6 month tolerate stable respond disease . - The co-primary endpoint safety determine rate , severity , duration adverse event base CTCAE v4 criterion . Assessment DLTs occur every 2 week first 4 week dose level . Safety monitoring occur every 4 week thereafter . - The co-primary endpoint efficacy define rate overall response 24 week per NIH consensus criterion ( CR PR ) . - Peripheral blood sample collect prior treatment , 2 week , 12 week every 12 week thereafter evaluate cytokine cellular profile , STAT phosphorylation , candidate chronic GVHD biomarkers . Pharmacokinetic study also perform dose level . - In initial futility analysis , 0 first 7 patient enrol cohort 1 respond 12 week , 2nd cohort patient accrued start treatment high dose ( 4mg daily ) . Otherwise , 1 first 7 patient respond cohort 1 , 21 evaluable patient treat cohort 1 . Similarly , second cohort use , 0 7 patient enrolled second cohort respond 12 week , patient accrue . Otherwise , 1 first 7 patient respond cohort 2 , 21 evaluable patient treat cohort 2 . - A total 21 evaluable patient enrol either cohort 1 2 appropriate , order 80 % power detect response rate consistent 30 % rule 10 % , one-sided significance level 0.10 cohort . As early stopping rule safety , 2/3 great patient give dose level experience dose limit toxicity require dose reduction discontinuation , dose subsequently use dose escalation take place .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Moderate severe cGVHD diagnose stag per NIH criterion . Responses JAK inhibitor restrict specific organ , organ involvement eligible . 2 . Age great equal 18 year age . Because inadequate dose adverse event data currently available use baricitinib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 3 . Karnofsky performance score &gt; 50 % 4 . Chronic GVHD respond highdose corticosteroid ( prednisone 1.0 mg/kg/day least 1 week prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day 1 mg/kg every day least 4 week ) , secondline therapy ( ) . 5 . If patient take systemic therapy cGVHD time enrollment , must stable taper dos precede 4 week . 6 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mcL absolute lymphocyte count great equal 500/mcL platelet great equal 50,000/mcL hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal , unless know history Gilbert disease AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal , : creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 ( CockroftGault formula ) 7 . Primary malignancy patient receive transplant stable 3 month prior enrollment study . 8 . The effect baricitinib human fetal development unknown . Women childbearing potential men must agree use 2 effective form contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation 28 day study drug exposure . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , man partner become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 9 . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Systemic immune suppression systemic therapy cGVHD start within precede 4 week . 2 . Hypersensitivity JAK inhibitor . 3 . Any serious medical condition within previous 4 week place subject unacceptable risk participate study confound ability interpret data study , include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , acute kidney injury , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Uncontrolled infection , include active HIV1 , Hepatitis B ( HBV ) and/or Hepatitis C ( HCV ) infection ( positive HBV HCV viral load set positive HBV core antibody surface antibody HCV antibody ) . History HBV HCV allow uncontrolled viral infection . Because study agent may impact response infection , patient active viral infection exclude . 5 . Recurrent progressive malignancy require anticancer treatment . 6 . Other cancer except transplant do &lt; 2 year study entry , except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ uterine cervix breast . 7 . Patients receive investigational agent . 8 . NIH lung score 3 . 9 . Pregnant woman exclude study teratogenic effect baricitinib unknown . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother baricitinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent .</criteria>
