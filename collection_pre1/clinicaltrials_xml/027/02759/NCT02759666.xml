	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial SHR3162 Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poly adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -ribose polymerase ( PARP ) family proteins play important role multiple cellular process , include single-strand DNA break , leave unrepaired , lead double-strand break ( DSB ) DNA replication . The DSB repair either error-free homologous recombination ( HR ) error-prone non-homology end joining . In HR deficient cancer cell mutation HR gene BRCA1 , BRCA2 partner localizer BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) , DSB efficiently correctly repair , result cell death . Viable cell , hand , normal HR replicate often cancer cell ; thus survive PARP inhibition . PARP inhibitor actively develop worldwide promise anti-tumor therapeutic . The current trial conduct participant advance solid tumor satisfactory treatment yet available . In `` 3+3 '' dose escalation part study , participant enrol sequentially 4 dose level SHR3162 : 20 mg/day , 40 mg/day , 80 mg/day , 120 mg/day ( 3 6 participant per cohort ) . Following first dose , participant single-dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) run-in period ( 1-week treatment-free ) evaluate safety single-dose PK . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) observe 1-week period , SHR3162 administration resume dose level . In dose expansion part study , 12 additional participant enrol MTD .</detailed_description>
