	<brief_title>Treatment Effect Between Dexlansoprazole Double-dose Lansoprazole Obesity Patients With Reflux Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct National Cheng Kung University Hospital , tertiary health care center Tainan , Taiwan . All participant give write informed consent enrollment . After panendoscopy confirm enrollment eligibility reflux esophagitis Los Angeles A B , patient evenly randomize DEX group ( receive 8-week dexlansoprazole 60 mg per day ) double-dose PPI group ( receive 8-week lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily ) . The enrolled patient randomize two series seal envelope contain prescheduled group code ; one series overweight patient obese patient . In series seal envelope , number group code equal within every 10 seal envelope . In patient , demographic factor genotype S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase ( CYP2C19 ) check defined poor metabolizer ( PM ) , homologous ( HomoEM ) heterologous extensive metabolizer ( HeteroEM ) . Each patient treat continuously dexlansoprazole 60 mg per day lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily eight week . During 8-week study period , patient request record daily clinical symptom reflux esophagitis special sheet , include severity acid regurgitation ( AR , score 0 : free symptom ; score 1 : attack episodes &lt; 5 time per day ; score 2 : 6-10 time per day ; score 3 : 10 episode per day ) , heartburn ( HB , score 0 : absence symptom ; score 1 : tolerable event interfere daily work ; score 2 : intolerable event interfere daily work , need medication relieve symptom ; score 3 : complaint interfere completion daily work , cause patient wake night cough , combine non-specific complaint ) . The patient schedule return clinic drug refill , hand back daily symptom record end fourth eighth week treatment . The cumulative proportion patient sustain symptomatic response ( SSR ) , define free acid regurgitation heartburn last seven day , record 8-week study period study group . All patient start treatment include intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis rate SSR . If patient obvious symptom despite continuous PPI usage unscheduled visit load additional PPIs study , case drop per-protocol ( PP ) analysis . In addition , patient lose follow-up exclude PP analysis determine rate SSR . Besides compare difference rate SSR two study group , study also determine whether patient different CYP2C19 genotype difference cumulative rate SSR therapy two study group .</detailed_description>
