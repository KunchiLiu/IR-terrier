	<brief_summary>Background : Prostate cancer common non-skin cancer U.S. men . Treatments early less aggressive disease limit . Researchers want test device destroy cancerous tissue laser energy . They want see use ultrasound comfortable use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Objectives : To test cool laser applicator system treat prostate cancer lesion . To see ultrasound image practical feasible treatment laser ablation focal prostate cancer treatment . Eligibility : Men least 18 year old prostate cancer see MRI spread body . Design : Participants screen standard cancer care test . These include physical exam , lab test , MRI . For MRI , lie machine take picture . Participants prostate biopsy . Needle sample take 12 place prostate . This guide MRI ultrasound , obtain coil rectum . Participants stay clinic 1 2 day . A cooling catheter ( plastic tube ) put bladder . Ultrasound guide laser applicator directly tumor . The cooling catheter remove . A different catheter put urethra keep bladder empty . The next day , participant physical exam PSA blood test . Participants 6 follow-up visit 3 year . At visit , physical exam lab test . At visit , also MRI scan prostate biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fusion Guided Focal Laser Ablation Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Pilot study evaluate feasibility real time ultrasound image guide thermal laser ablation low risk focal prostate tumor . Prostate cancer relatively slow growing , double time local tumor estimate 2 4 year . Some prostate cancer prove small , low grade , noninvasive appear pose little risk life health . Recent patient series suggest 20 % 30 % men undergo radical prostatectomy pathologic feature radical prostatectomy specimen consistent insignificant `` indolent '' cancer pose little threat life health . An NIH/NCI protocol number 11-C-0158 titled MR Image guide focal laser ablation therapy prostate cancer treat 15 patient without major complication past 5 year . Out 15 patient , 3 evidence disease reoccurrence . This data prepare publication ( verbal communication Peter Pinto , MD , principal investigator ) , however require long resource-intensive MRI imaging , may barrier broad translation community set . Specialized custom expensive MRI-compatible equipment also require . Focal laser ablation prostate cancer use Medtronic-Visualase laser FDA clear . NIH / NCI clinical trial perform MRI + ultrasound ( US ) fusion biopsy nearly 1500 patient , &gt; 30,000 biopsy past 12 year . We propose perform ultrasound ( US ) guide focal laser ablation fusion visualization co-display pre-acquired MRI treatment patient low volume low-grade disease . Objectives : To determine feasibility treat biopsy-confirmed MR-visible , low-grade prostate tumor ( ) use ultrasound ( US ) image-guided focal laser interstitial thermal ablation ) . Eligibility : Patients must localize , low-volume , non-aggressive , low risk prostate cancer MR visible confirm needle biopsy . Tumor must confine within prostate involves one-half one lobe less . PSA &lt; 15 ng/ml , PSA density ( PSA/prostate volume ) &lt; 0.15 ng/mL2 patient PSA &gt; 15 ng/mL Men equal 18 year age . Preoperative clearance NIH Department Anesthesia Surgical Services . No evidence metastatic disease per NCCN guideline Design : Pilot study , test feasibility ultrasound-guided thermal ablation focal prostate cancer . A total 30 patient enrol yield 20 evaluable patient</detailed_description>

Targeted tumor must &gt; 5mm urethra , rectal wall , neurovascular bundle . Must prostate MRI perform NIH within 6 month prior ablation . No evidence metastatic disease work per NCCN guideline version 1.2016 Prostate Cancer Bone scan indicate r/o metastatic disease [ clinical T1 PSA &gt; 20 T2 PSA &gt; 10 , Gleason score &gt; 8 , T3 T4 tumor , symptomatic disease ] PSA &lt; 15 ng/ml , PSA density ( PSA/prostate volume ) &lt; 0.15 ng/mL2 patient PSA &gt; 15 ng/mL Men &gt; 18 year age .

Preoperative clearance NIH Department Anesthesia Surgical Services Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subject understands experimental treatment available standard treatment option . These option would include limited : active surveillance , external beam radiation brachytherapy , androgen deprivation therapy , focal cryoablation , prostatectomy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Presence 3 distinct MR visible lesion also positive biopsy , presence multifocal disease 3 sextant , regardless MRI visibility . Presence extra capsular , seminal vesical invasion metastatic disease per NCCN guideline . Bone scan indicate rule metastatic disease [ clinical T1 PSA &gt; 20 T2 PSA &gt; 10 ] . Patient unable commit follow . History prior treatment prostate cancer . Acute urinary tract infection . Patients uncontrolled coagulopathies . Altered mental status prevent consent answer question conduct trial exclude safety purpose . Other serious illness accord PI : involve cardiac , respiratory , CNS , renal hepatic organ system , would preclude study completion increase risk local therapy acceptable level . Inability undergo contrast enhance MRI per American College Radiology Clinical Center , Department Radiology guideline . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
