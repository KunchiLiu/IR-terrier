	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study evaluate new anchor rotator cuff repair , Smith &amp; Nephew Healicoil anchor . This anchor utilize small open-construct design promote bone-in growth potentially allow release bone marrow factor repair site . In vivo ovine study compare Arthrex BioComposite Corkscrew FT rotator cuff anchor Arthrex SwivelLock anchor show superior bone in-growth . Thus , study consist three separate aim order clinically biochemically investigate capability Healicoil anchor efficacy rotator cuff repair . One , evaluate bone growth anchor compare standard poly-ether ether ketone ( PEEK ) anchor . Two , analyze marrow element release repair site open construct . Three , compare functional outcome patient rotator cuff repair use Healicoil anchor compare traditional Twinfix PEEK anchor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Healicoil Suture Anchor Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A great deal research devote determine optimal technique rotator cuff repair , common orthopedic procedure . Current repair technique involve use suture anchor transosseous tunnel , goal reattaching torn tendon anatomic insertion rotator cuff . There multitude different repair construct anchor design available . For example , surgeon utilize single row suture anchor repair , whereas others use two row anchor `` double row '' construct . A variety anchor also available ; load suture require knot tying , others use `` knotless '' technique . Regardless , time zero stability rotator cuff repair essential , ideal anchor construct yet determine . Time zero stability immediately rotator cuff repair important , however , contemporary research also focus cascade influence biologic heal rotator cuff repair augmentation improve functional result . Specifically , various author look cytokine , growth factor stem cell involve process . The question remain role factor play whether technique facilitate use improve heal rotator cuff repair . Data exist animal model show growth factor improve tendon healing . Research Plan : The propose study prospective randomize trial 40 patient undergoing arthroscopic repair full thickness rotator cuff tear . Patients randomize one two group ; Healicoil anchor vs standard 5.5 PEEK anchor . Follow-up take place 6 week , 6 month , 1 year rotator cuff repair . At time operative procedure bone marrow aspirate drill hole use anchor send analysis . At 6 month mark patient get computer tomography ( CT ) scan order determine amount ingrowth within anchor . Finally , outcome score within first year record . This data result publication three separate study . - Growth factor stem cell analysis time operative procedure - CT ingrowth Healicoil anchor 6 month - Clinical outcome patient rotator cuff repair use Healicoil anchor Enrollment Process : Patients determine clinically full thickness rotator cuff tear elect surgery invite participate study . Informed consent obtain pre-operatively office setting . A physical examination shoulder conduct , patient complete shoulder survey order determine baseline value Simple Shoulder Test ( SST ) , American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score ( ASES ) , University California , Los Angeles activity score ( UCLA ) , Constant score . Eligible patient randomize one two study group time surgery . Enrollment continue 20 patient group . Participants control group undergo rotator cuff repair utilize 5.5mm full thread Twinfix PK anchor tendon fixation . Those experimental group undergo procedure , use Smith &amp; Nephew Healicoil anchor . Participants blind anchor-type receive . Operative Procedure : A standard rotator cuff repair complete utilizing medial row Healicoil lateral row PEEK anchor . At time drill anchor , bone marrow aspirate collect turning water use large gauge biopsy needle aspirate content drill hole . The anchor place . The aspiration process repeat small gauge needle use aspirate within open construct Healicoil anchor . All material sent laboratory Dr. Chubinskaya immediate analysis : - IGF-1 - FGF-2 - BMP-7 - BMP-2 - PDGF-CHAIN A - PDGF-CHAIN B - EGF - VEGF - Mesenchymal stem cell Office Visits : Following surgical rotator cuff repair , patient return routine post-operative follow-up 6 week , 6 month , one year . The 6 week visit involve clinical exam assessment shoulder range motion . At 6 month 1 year visit , patient complete subjective objective outcome measure physical examination shoulder member research team . Subject participation last approximately 30 minute . Subjective objective measure include : - Shoulder Survey - include SANE , VAS , ASES , Constant score - Shoulder physical exam The shoulder Survey may collect paper electronically use OBERD ( Rush approve repository - ORA # 12042506 ) . The shoulder Survey data collect 30 day time surgery sue baseline data . CT Scanning : At 6 month follow visit patient undergo direct CT scan affect humeral head . The scan provide 1 mm cut humeral head great tuberosity ( site anchor ) . This limit amount radiation exposure patient provide necessary data . Previous author show technique make radiation exposure patient roughly equivalent standard chest xray . These CT scan evaluate presence bone within confines anchor . One mm scan allow quantitative volume analysis bone present . Planned Analysis : Descriptive statistic obtain age time surgery , physical examination finding , range motion , standardized score , bone marrow growth factor analysis , bone in-growth evaluate CT scan . The statistical analysis conduct p level &lt; .05 . Statistical test use obtain inferential statistic finding include pair t-tests ANOVA . Geoffrey S. Van Thiel , MD , MBA Scott W. Trenhaile , MD collaborate investigator Rockford Orthopedics Rockford , Illinois , Rush subcontract Rockford Orthopedics enroll subject , treat per study protocol follow-up visit . The bone marrow analysis Rockford subject do Rush . Rockford Orthopedics use local IRB study .</detailed_description>
