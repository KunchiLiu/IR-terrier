	<brief_summary>Commercial interactive game console include Nintendo Wii™ Sony Playstation Eyetoy™ use stroke rehabilitation variable success seem safe , feasible effective treatment option . The recently release Xbox Kinect™ game console superiorities others require special controller sensitive sensor provide accurate motion-capturing . However , limited evidence clinical utility Xbox Kinect™ stroke rehabilitation . Currently design physically mentally healthy people like previous console . Therefore , safety feasibility system evaluate first place use alternative adjunctive training method stroke patient . To best knowledge , study evaluate clinical feasibility Xbox Kinect™ stroke rehabilitation . The aim pilot study evaluate feasibility safety Xbox Kinect™ train upper extremity subacute stroke rehabilitation . The secondary aim evaluate efficacy upper extremity motor functional recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study plan single-blind , randomize control , pilot trial . It approve Ankara University Faculty Medicine Ethics Committee conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki . Stroke patient hospitalize inpatient rehabilitation Ankara University Faculty Medicine , Cebeci Research Application Hospital , Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Clinic December 2012 March 2014 , assess determine eligibility study . All patient diagnose stroke neurologist accord World Health Organization stroke definition confirm neuroimaging ( compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ) . All patient fulfil inclusion criterion receive detailed explanation study write informed consent obtain participant prior enrollment . Patient characteristic collect baseline include socio-demographic feature ( age , gender , marital status , educational level , vocation ) , stroke type , time stroke onset enrollment , affected side , handedness , comorbid condition , spasticity grade ( accord Modified Ashworth Scale ) motor recovery stage accord Brunnstrom Motor Assessment Scale ( BMAS ) . Affected upper extremity examine use Box Blocks Test ( BBT ) Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) . Baseline level functional independence assess use Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) . Participants randomly allocate two group ; experimental group control group . Both experimental group control group receive conventional rehabilitation program 4 week ( 60 minutes/day , 5 days/week ) . The experimental group underwent additional training Xbox Kinect™ 4 week ( 60 minutes/day , 5 days/week ) . The primary outcome measure pilot study relate feasibility safety Xbox Kinect™ subacute stroke rehabilitation . Treatment attendance ratio , proportion complete training time plan training time , use primary feasibility outcome . The treatment attendance ratio calculate three different measurement : total training time , train time per session number session . In addition , result obtain patient feedback survey also use feasibility outcome . The ratio patient adverse event relate intervention serious adverse event study define primary safety outcome . Rating perceived exertion measure accord Borg 10 Point Scale also use safety outcome . To determine efficacy intervention , BBT , WMFT , FIM , BMAS use secondary outcome measure . Mean , standard deviation , median , min-max percentile value calculate socio-demographic clinical feature , primary secondary outcome measure descriptive statistic . The Shapiro-Wilk test use normality test . The Wilcoxon sign rank test use evaluate difference within group . The Mann Whitney U test use evaluate difference group . P value less .05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
