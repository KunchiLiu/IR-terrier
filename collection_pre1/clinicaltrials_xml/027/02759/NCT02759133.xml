	<brief_title>Preoperative Localization Infraclinical Breast Tumors : Isotopic Localization iodine125 Seed Versus Standard Localization Using Metal Wire</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The widespread development organize breast cancer screen enable diagnosis nonpalpable , small-size cancer lesion ( infraclinical stage ) . When conservative breast surgery schedule ( tumorectomy zonectomy ) , preoperative localization lesion mandatory . To date , wire localization non-palpable lesion frequently use technique worldwide . Nevertheless , technique present number drawback : - uncomfortable patient . The wire implant transcutaneously , cross skin reach lesion protrudes outside breast , thus limit patient 's mobility give rise discomfort even pain movement . - furthermore , above-mention reason , risk wire become dislodge , break disinserted patient movement ( transfer unit , pre-op shower , installation operating room ) , thus jeopardize quality plan surgery increase risk unhealthy resection margin even non-removal tumor . Cases even report intrapulmonary wire migration . - order lessen risk , wire must place late possible transfer surgical wing ( previous day early ) . Consequently , organize patient 's transfer , particularly event outpatient surgery ( le 12h hospital ) become complicated require coordination different unit charge preoperative management ( radiology , nuclear medicine , admittance , operate room ) early inclusion patient operate room schedule postponement surgery event migration displacement wire . These various constraint result reduction number patient able benefit outpatient management , demonstrate Dravet et al . Several alternative technique put forward order overcome difficulty , include radioguided seed localization ( RSL ) , consist implant seal source radioactive iodine125 ( iodine seed ) inside tumor provide preoperative marker monitor surgeon use gamma probe . The RSL technique currently use Europe ( Netherlands ) , Canada USA . This technique appear offer several advantage : - It simple radiologic technique perform ultrasound stereotaxic control , allow accurate localization lesion risk marker move displace , - It require special train surgeon already skilled use gamma probe sentinel node technique , - It allow concomitant , interference-free performance sentinel node surgery mean gamma probe able detect specifically Tc99m and/or Iodine 125 , - It free organizational localization constraint limit access outpatient surgery , rank high priority govern body ( 50 % surgery perform outpatient basis 2016 ) . As half-life iodine seed 60 day , possible , theory , insert several day , even several month , surgery . In way , patient transfer simplify turnover operate block outpatient management increase . Moreover , localization method could also use tumorectomies follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy , - It present none drawback relate patient mobility . Patient comfort enhance patient able move freely , few risk displacement disinsertion , less pain , etc . - Patient satisfaction higher among woman undergone iodine seed localization oppose conventional localization technique Furthermore , various study demonstrate safety technique term radiation protection radiation minimal patient ( equivalent amount receive two mammography view ) well staff . Its reliability regard surgical excision procedure ( positive inadequate margin rate , revision surgery rate ) demonstrate 3 randomized study high level evidence . Thus , 2001 , Gray et al . publish first randomize study compare RSL technique conventional wire method show superiority iodine seed localization term positive margin surgical revision rate ( RSL 26 % v WL 26 % , p=0.02 ) concomitant increase tumorectomy specimen volumes marker migration rate . More recently , Lovrics et al . ( 2011 ) Bloomquist et al ( 2015 ) publish randomize non-inferiority study highlight equivalent result two technique regard quality tumor excision ( positive margin rate : RSL 15.1 % v WL 19 % p=0.389 , : RSL 19.4 % vs 15.3 % , p=0.53 ) . In addition , RSL method show significant advantage regard operate time pain experience patient localization procedure . No French team investigate localization method account legal constraint . Nonetheless , would appear wire localization technique satisfy surgical team since another pre-operative localization technique involve injection Tc99m contact tumor develop past year replace wire method . This procedure meet little success , gradually abandon . Unfortunately , inject Tc99m around tumor render surgical procedure less precise necessitates resect large segment gland potentially damaging esthetic repercussion . Implantation seal radioactive source iodine seed help mitigate drawback . This study project aim evaluate feasibility safety use 1 grain iodine localization purpose mean randomized comparative study compare wire localization iodine seed localization patient present situ , biopsy-proven , non-palpable invasive ductal breast carcinoma require conservative surgical management associate , , axillary procedure ( SN removal axillary curettage ) .</detailed_description>
