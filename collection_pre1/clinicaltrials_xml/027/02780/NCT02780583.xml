	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine whether give injection anakinra safe well tolerated treatment give adjunct standard prescribe treatment patient admit hospital sign severe inflammation ( macrophage activation syndrome ) potentially life-threatening . Anakinra commercially available product ( Kineret™ ) approve treatment rheumatoid arthritis ; replica naturally occur protein call Il-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) , make human inhibit regulate action interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) . IL-1 mediator inflammation generate excess amount immune system cell result severe dysfunction multiple organ life-threatening . The specific primary objective study determine give anakinra result increase infection complication mortality . Additional data collect determine whether anakinra administration result unanticipated side effect set , effect anakinra administration inflammation marker , overall dose steroid require treat inflammation , length hospital stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Macrophage Activation Syndrome ( MAS ) With Anakinra</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macrophage activation syndrome ( MAS ) disorder whereby immune system generate high level substance ( cytokine ) promote inflammation extent dysfunction occur multiple organ system unchecked , frequently fatal affect individual . This occur set number different immune system disorder include , systemic lupus , systemic-onset juvenile arthritis , adult-onset Still 's disease . MAS also occur response infection certain virus Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) malignancies involve lymphocyte . Because high fatality MAS ( &gt; 50 % ) , number different treatment try manage disorder , include use high-dose steroid , immune suppressant cyclosporine , cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment ( etoposide ) variable success and/or severe complication immune suppression ( may occur etoposide ) . A number recent case report case series report success use cytokine-blocking therapy anakinra treatment MAS associate systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis adult Still 's disease . Anakinra bio-engineered form naturally occur interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) , block action interleukin-1 , one cytokine express present high amount patient MAS . Anakinra/Il-1ra attractive treatment patient present clinical feature MAS relatively short half-life easy administer subcutaneous injection . In previous trial use patient clinical feature bacterial sepsis ( fever , elevated heart rate , low/falling blood pressure ) , show anakinra harmful effect also appear benefit repect define primary outcome improve survival . However , recent re-analysis data accumulate previous sepsis trial ( primary define outcome survival ) indicate survival actually increase subgroup sepsis patient feature MAS ( ferritin elevation excess 2,000 ng/ml , sign coagulopathy , liver enzyme elevation ) randomize receive anakinra compare subgroup sepsis patient feature MAS randomize receive placebo . Previous dos anakinra 3500 mg/day 72 hour employ trial adult patient sepsis note well tolerate without increased adverse outcome compare patient randomize placebo . Recent case report show dos 100 mg every 6 hour efficacious well tolerated child systemic onset juvenile arthritis complicate refractory macrophage activation syndrome . This study first control study confirm whether anakinra dose 10 mg/kg/day maximum dose 200 mg/day divide every 12 hour ( child ≤40 kg ) 5 mg/kg/day maximum dose 400 mg/day divide every 6 hour ( child &gt; 40 kg adult ) result increase mortality infection complication administer addition current UAB standard care treatment ( corticosteroid ) child adult hospitalize suspected macrophage activation syndrome .</detailed_description>
