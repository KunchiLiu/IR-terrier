	<brief_summary>Adaptive reason problem-solving critical skill allow accurate decision make base varying level information . In many situation decision must make communicated stressful , time-sensitive condition . In context , ability apply inductive deductive reasoning complex , ambiguous , and/or novel problem critical . The objective INSIGHT project establish comprehensive rigorous brain training protocol significantly improve adaptive reasoning problem solve . We examine variety intervention ( cognitive training , physical fitness training , physiological stimulation , , combination thereof ) ass ability improve adaptive reasoning problem solve ability . Multimodal intervention hypothesize act synergistically significantly enhance fluid intelligence ( Gf ) underlie brain structure function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INSIGHT , A Comprehensive , Multidisciplinary Brain Training System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent innovation cognitive neuroscience advance understanding neurobiological foundation fluid intelligence ( Gf ) adaptive reason problem solving ( ARP ) . Rather engage single brain structure ( e.g. , prefrontal cortex ) operating fix level performance throughout adulthood , emerge neuroscience evidence indicate Gf ARP mediate distribute neural system whose function significantly enhance specific type intervention , include cognitive training , high-definition transcranial direct-current brain stimulation ( HD-tDCS ) , physical fitness training . The main objective INSIGHT project establish validate comprehensive rigorous brain training protocol incorporate best available intervention enhancement Gf ARP . The project divide two phase , first occur February -November 2014 second occur February - December 2015 . The two phase similar structure goals/hypotheses , several methodological difference term intervention , arm , outcome measure . This document contain information pertinent 2014 phase , examine relative contribution physical fitness intervention , video-game base training , high-definition transcranial direct-current brain stimulation ( HD-tDCS ) improvement Gf/ARP , executive function , work memory , relational memory , physical fitness level , brain structure/function . Arms/groups complete 1 week test establish baseline measurement cognitive ability , physical fitness , brain structure/function . 16 week various intervention protocol . These protocol could include single multiple intervention type ( ) vary schedule . Three 70-min training session complete per week , arm complete 56 hour training , total . Following completion intervention period 1 week post-assessment measure change cognitive ability , physical fitness , brain structure/function . Technical Justification Physical Fitness Intervention : The beneficial effect physical fitness cognitive performance brain health document many study . For example , literature suggests increase exercise lead birth new neuron hippocampus ( key brain region underlie Gf ) , increased connection among neuron throughout brain , development new vasculature structure , increased production neurotrophic protein , enhance learning memory , enhanced executive control include attention inhibition , work memory , mental flexibility , action monitoring . In particular , ( 1 ) exercise effect large task involve executive control function work memory , planning , problem solve - ability essential Gf ARP ; ( 2 ) aerobic exercise training , combine strength flexibility training , great positive effect cognition compare exercise training program include aerobic component . Such finding provide important justification physical activity intervention propose . Hence , propose fitness intervention employ combined aerobic/resistance training program enhance benefit cognitive training Gf ARP . Technical Justification Video Game-Based Training : Training five cognitive skill - ( 1 ) processing speed , ( 2 ) attention , ( 3 ) work memory , ( 4 ) relational memory , ( 5 ) cognitive flexibility - show provide promise transfer result Gf relevant construct . This training regime basis design Mind Frontiers software platform . Mind Frontiers include integrate suite mini-games design train five core cognitive skill . The mechanic , abstraction cognitive exercise , ensure scientific integrity training effect exercise preserve , exercise implement game motivational feature adaptive difficulty . Technical justification HD-tDCS : It hypothesize Gf ARP critically dependent fronto-parietal brain network , thus bilateral , specific stimulation frontal cortex high definition transcranial direct current stimulation ( HD-tDCS ) would excitatory effect neuron within network , make likely fire , thereby enable faster learn facilitate transfer Gf . Technical Justification Active Control : Change detection visual search task select active control task previous work indicate train low-level perceptual ability transfer Gf ARP .</detailed_description>
