	<brief_summary>Perioperative chemotherapy gold standard treatment resectable advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma . The efficacy strategy demonstrate two randomized study ( 1,2 ) . It reduce tumour size surgery , treat micrometastases evaluate chemosensitivity . Disease free overall survival rate significantly improve perioperative chemotherapy compare surgery alone . However , limitation study among patient require chemotherapy , almost 70 % patient complete sequence . This sequence define administration 2 4 cycle 2 4 cycle surgery , accord protocol . The major cause absence impossibility realization postoperative chemotherapy presence postoperative complication , postoperative serious asthenia impair nutritional physical status ( 1,2 ) . Poor physical condition assess cardiopulmonary exercise testing , reflect reduce physiological reserve , predictive postoperative complication ( 3,4 ) . A physical training , even short period various population , beneficial improve physical condition , cardiopulmonary function muscular mass patient ( 5-8 ) . A prehabilitation 6 week period surgical consultation surgery decrease postoperative morbidity hospital stay cardiovascular surgery study ever perform gastric oesophageal cancer ( 7,9 ) . Prehabilitation revolve around three ax : 1 ) physical training base initial cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( VO2peak , anaerobic threshold ( AT ) 6-min walk test ( 6MWT ) ) , 3 time week , supervise physical therapist 2 ) nutritional care ensure compliance nutrition program adapt nutritional management base protein energy need level spontaneous oral intake 2 ) psychological treatment psychologist reduce preoperative anxiety . To knowledge , study ever focus gastroesophageal cancer . The benefit prehabilitation cancer may particularly important 1 ) surgery associate high postoperative morbidity ( 40 % , especially respiratory ) mortality ( 5 % ) 2 ) physical nutritional status patient often precarious ( cancer cachexia , gastroesophageal obstruction ) , 3 ) need preoperative chemotherapy decline physical reserve associate lengthening time consultation surgery 3 month ( 10 ) . Also , investigator hypothesize physical training , personalize nutritional support psychologist management may decrease postoperative complication , increase postoperative nutritional status , would allow patient receive full cancer treatment . The aim study evaluate , gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma , effect prehabilitation compare conventional care , percentage patient reach complete oncological treatment decide multidisciplinary tumour board .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Prehabilitation Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma : Study Protocol Multicentric , Randomised Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventions After first visit surgeon , patient present multidisciplinary tumour board validate inclusion criterion schedule number cycle pre- postoperative chemotherapy . After step , second consultation surgeon allow verify inclusion exclusion criterion perform randomization . For two group , initial ( chemotherapy ) final ( one week surgery ) evaluation perform . The evaluation include cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( VO2peak , AT 6MWT ) , nutritional evaluation ( albumin ) , bioelectric impedance analysis , evaluation physical activity ingesta , evaluation level depressive symptom anxiety HADS questionnaire quality life ( 5Q-FD questionnaire ) . Prehab group Exercise intervention : The total-body exercise consist 1 hour supervise exercise least 3 day per week , total 18 cycle , alternate aerobic resistance training . Exercise intensity prescribe base rate 6MWT , AT VO2peak . The participant exercise presence kinesiologist provide corrective feedback necessary . Nutrition intervention : Initially , nutritionist perform medical biological examination nutritional status provide individualize care patient . Individual protein requirement calculate 1.2 g protein per kilogram body weight ( adjust body weight use obese patient ) , per European Society Clinical Nutrition Metabolism ( ESPEN ) guideline , regard surgical patient ( 12 ) . Patients ask consume protein supplement within one hour exercise regimen capitalize postexercise muscle protein synthesis ( 13 ) . Then , dietician ass compliance nutritional support cycle chemotherapy adjust necessary . After preoperative chemotherapy , second evaluation nutritionist perform . Psychologist intervention : Patients receive one hour visit train psychologist provide technique aim reduce anxiety , relaxation exercise base imagery visualization , together breathe exercise . Each patient practice exercise psychologist initially cycle chemotherapy home two three time per week . The psychologist also provide suggestion enhance reinforce patient ' motivation comply exercise nutritional aspect intervention . Control group : The control group treat accord conventional care ; receive specific intervention surgery except nutritional support physiotherapy surgeon 's discretion .</detailed_description>
