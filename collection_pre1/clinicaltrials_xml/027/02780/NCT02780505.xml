	<brief_title>Assessment Effect Vitamin C Anemia Patients With Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>World Health Organization ( WHO ) define anemia hemoglobin ( Hgb ) concentration le 12.0 g/dL pre-menopausal woman , low 13.0 g/dL adult male post-menopausal woman .Diagnosis anemia high significance , might first manifestation serious illness . Some chronic disease also lead anemia : autoimmune disorder , liver cirrhosis , cancer , chronic renal disease Anemia associate poor prognosis patient chronic renal disease , especially undergoing long-term hemodialysis . In patient Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) less 25 30 mL/min , anemia observe within 90 percent patient . Among patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , association anemia increase mortality secondary cardiovascular disease Ascorbic acid level conflict dialysis patient different range low , normal , even normal . In hemodialysis patient , administration 150 200 mg vitamin C per day recommend maintain level . Ascorbic acid vitamin C increase delivery iron ferritin reticuloendothelial system therefore elevate iron use heme synthesis . Vitamin deficiency one cause increase mortality among hemodialysis patient . During dialysis process , vitamin eliminate hemodialyzer membrane , thus affect red blood cell production .Vitamin C deficiency may play important role increase inflammatory status dialysis patient . This vitamin anti-inflammatory effect due electron transfer ability . Several study show role vitamin vitamin D B12 treatment anemia patient undergoing hemodialysis .The infusion ascorbate supplementation might reduce oxidative stress . In addition , vitamin C play important role iron metabolism application red blood cell formation . Permeable membrane highly associate significant loss vitamin C , vitamin improve oxidative stress hemodialysis patient . We aim assess effect vitamin C patient continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .</detailed_description>
