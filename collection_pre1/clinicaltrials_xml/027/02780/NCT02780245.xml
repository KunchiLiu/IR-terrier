	<brief_title>Role Tranexamic Acid Versus Uterine Cooling Caesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleeding vaginal operative delivery always prime concern . Despite significant progress obstetric care 125,000 woman die obstetric hemorrhage annually world . The incidence CS increasing , average blood loss CS ( 1000 mL ) double amount lose vaginal delivery ( 500 mL ) . CS rate high 25-30 % many area world . In Egypt CS rate 27.6 % , United States America , 1970-2009 CS rate rise 4.5-32.9 % , decline 32.8 % delivery 2010 . In spite various measure prevent blood loss CS , post-partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) continue common complication see almost 20 % case , cause approximately 25 % maternal death worldwide , lead increase maternal morbidity mortality . Women undergo CS much likely delivered repeat operation subsequent pregnancy . For woman undergo subsequent CS , maternal risk even great like massive obstetric hemorrhage , hysterectomy , admission intensive care unit , maternal death . Medications , oxytocin , misoprostol prostaglandin F2α , use control bleed postoperatively . TXA synthetic analog amino acid lysine , antifibrinolytic agent . Its intravenous administration routinely use many year reduce prevent excessive hemorrhage various medical condition disorder ( help hemostasis ) , also surgical procedure like benign hysterectomy , open heart surgery , scoliosis surgery , oral surgery , liver surgery , total hip knee arthroplasty , urology . It show useful efficient reduce blood loss incidence blood transfusion surgery , decrease risk death bleeding trauma patient . It also include World Health Organization ( WHO ) Model List Essential Medicines . About role CS , recent study show TXA advantage useful effect safely reduce blood loss requirement additional ecbolics . Its dos use intravenously reduce blood loss CS bolus 1gm , 10 mg/kg , 15 mg/kg advantage 10 mg/kg anemic parturients . A recent study Mitchell et al . conclude Uterine cool cesarean delivery efficient enough decrease blood loss incidence postpartum hemorrhage . This study aim compare role prophylactic predefined intravenous Tranexamic Acid dose versus intraoperative Uterine Cooling reduce blood loss incidence postpartum hemorrhage secondary CS .</detailed_description>
