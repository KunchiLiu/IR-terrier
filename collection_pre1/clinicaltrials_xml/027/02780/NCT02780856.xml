	<brief_summary>This prospective , multi-centre clinical study evaluate safety performance Calcivis Caries Activity Imaging System . Dentists identify tooth surface either sound ( inactive ) unsound ( active caries lesion present ) accord ICDAS staging ( International Caries Detection Assessment System ) . Images tooth surface take Calcivis System immediately application disclose solution contain bioluminescent protein . Presence absence elevate luminescence image indicate activity / inactivity presence absence active demineralisation tooth surface . The study deem success 70 % agreement : 1. elevate luminescence presence active caries determine dentist , 2. absence luminescence determination sound tooth surface dentist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Performance Evaluation Calcivis System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental caries ( tooth decay ) significant clinical public health problem . The development caries lesions involve net mineral loss dental tissue , lead progressive loss tooth structure associate pain disease . Detecting , assess , diagnosis treat lesion core activity dentistry . Currently main detection diagnosis aid visual inspection use probe , together X-ray image . Determination activity status lesion ( likely progress ) require assess treatment need . Currently methods problematic involve clinician ' subjective assessment / monitoring lesion progression number visit . A previous clinical study prototype Calcivis System conduct . The result conclude Calcivis System safe use level agreement elevate luminescence area expect activity 70 % due chance ( NCT02098304 ) . This prospective , multi-centre clinical study design assess safety performance Calcivis System . The device evaluation comprise hand-held customized intra-oral camera take image lesion tooth surface immediately application disclose solution contains bioluminescent photo-protein . The photo-protein detects free calcium ion tooth surface produce light signal caries lesion active . For clinical study , patient identify Investigator attend routine dental appointment , meet inclusion exclusion criterion approach discus possible participation study . Patients give Patient Information Sheet read time consider participation study . If happy participate attend two Study Visits , 7 14 day apart . Written inform consent take study procedure conduct . As child age 16 include study , parent / guardian consent take appropriate . At study Visit 1 , demographic , relevant medication oral hygiene data collect . The dentist carry oral examination tooth / teeth identify per inclusion / exclusion criterion , clean prophy paste , rinse tap water 3-in-1 air / water spray air dry stag per ICDAS cod . Reference intra-oral photograph take tooth . The tooth / teeth surface air dry image Calcivis System , immediately application disclose solution . A maximum one sound ( unrestored , accessible , free smooth surface canine incisor , away gingival margin visible caries lesion ) one unsound ( erupt erupt molar premolar visible lesion deem active , plaque stagnation area ) tooth image per patient . imaging complete , patient rinse tap water . Adverse event collect throughout . The dentist share Calcivis image teeth patient . Post imaging questionnaire complete patient end Study Visit 1 user questionnaire complete dental team end Study Visit 1 day . Patients return ( Study Visit 2 ) , 7 14 day Visit 1 , final oral examination take place . Any adverse event observe volunteered patient record . The study image independently review another dentist , agreement expect lesion activity / inactive teeth Calcivis System .</detailed_description>
