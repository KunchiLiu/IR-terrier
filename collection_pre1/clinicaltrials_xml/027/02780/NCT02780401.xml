	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose vaccine therapy prevent cancer come back patient non-metastatic , node positive , human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2 negative breast cancer sign symptom disappear . Vaccines make deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving multiple vaccination may make strong immune response prevent delay return cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Preventing Cancer Recurrence Patients With Non-Metastatic , Node Positive , HER2 Negative Breast Cancer That Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety 3 escalating dos deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) plasmid base vaccine encode three breast cancer antigen ( insulin-like growth factor-binding protein [ IGFBP ] -2 , HER2 , insulin-like growth factor [ IGF ] -1 receptor [ 1R ] ) patient breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine immunogenicity pUMVC3-IGFBP2-HER2-IGF1R ( WOKVAC ) T helper cell ( Th ) polyepitope plasmid base vaccine patient breast cancer 3 escalating dos . II . To determine whether WOKVAC Th polyepitope plasmid base vaccine elicit persistent memory T cell response . III . To evaluate whether WOKVAC vaccination modulates T regulatory cell ( Treg ) myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) . IV . To evaluate change mammographic density use clinically available image prior Baseline post vaccination exploratory analysis . V. To determine recommended phase 2 WOKVAC dose breast cancer prevention study . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study WOKVAC . Patients receive WOKVAC sargramostim intradermally ( ID ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) vaccine administer contralateral arm . Patients bilateral ALND vaccine administer thigh . As much possible vaccine dose give within drain lymph node site . Patients monitor minimum 60 minute post vaccine administration . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , 6 month annually 5 year thereafter .</detailed_description>
