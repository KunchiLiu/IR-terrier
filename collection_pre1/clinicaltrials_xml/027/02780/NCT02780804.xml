	<brief_title>Entinostat Treating Pediatric Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose entinostat administer single-agent , weekly child recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity entinostat administer single agent , weekly child recurrent refractory solid tumor . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics entinostat child recurrent refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity entinostat within confines phase 1 study . II . To assess change histone H3 H4 acetylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) marker biologic activity entinostat . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive entinostat orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
