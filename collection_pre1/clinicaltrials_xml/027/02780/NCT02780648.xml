	<brief_summary>This single center , single arm unblinded prospective study safety pancreatic stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) patient unresectable , borderline resectable , recurrent pancreatic/periampullary cancer previously undergone treatment chemotherapy , surgery , photodynamic therapy , conventionally fractionate radiation treatment , combination therapy . Primary Objective • To estimate rate acute ( within 3 month treatment ) grade 3 great gastrointestinal hematologic toxicity patient treat Linac-based SBRT pancreatic periampullary cancer previously receive treatment . Secondary Objectives - To estimate rate late ( &gt; 3 month treatment ) grade 2 gastritis , enteritis , fistula , ulcer , grade 3 great gastrointestinal toxicity patient treat Linac-based SBRT pancreatic periampullary cancer - To estimate rate local progression , overall survival , metastasis-free survival , progression-free survival patient pancreatic periampullary cancer treat fractionated Linac-based SBRT . - To evaluate ability Linac-based SBRT provide pain control patient pain related pancreatic periampullary tumor . - To evaluate quality life patient undergoing treatment Linac-based SBRT pancreatic periampullary cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients receive 5 fraction 5 gray ( Gy ) 6.6 Gy deliver five-day period base whether receive prior radiation therapy pancreatic region . Treatment may deliver 2 week , provide patient receives least 2 fraction per week . Initial patient position base volumetric kV ( cone-beam computerize tomography ) image shifts bony anatomy appropriate . Orthogonal kV/MV kV/kV projection image use verify location fiducials prior delivery first treatment beam . A secondary shift base location fiducials may utilize , indicated position fiducials . For free-breathing treatment , kV fluoroscopic image obtain confirm anticipate position fiducials entire respiratory cycle . Active monitoring treatment delivery accuracy accomplish use kV and/or MV projection imaging , either immediately ( subset ) treatment field . Patient-specific dosimetric quality assurance ( QA ) perform per standard practice Department Radiation Oncology , Indiana University School Medicine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Age &gt; 18 year . Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70 % Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma pancreas ampulla Vater ; least majority histopathologic specimen must identify adenocarcinoma oppose another histologic subtype . In patient diagnosis recurrent disease ( base radiographic progression and/or rise CA199 level ) history biopsyproven adenocarcinoma pancreas ampulla Vater , repeat biopsy recurrence site require participation trial . Pancreatic periampullary tumor must less 8.0 cm great axial dimension time treatment planning . Patients treated combination surgical resection neoadjuvant/adjuvant conventional chemoradiation therapy resectable disease conventional chemoradiation definitive treatment unresectable borderline resectable disease eligible study , provide least 180 day elapse since complete previous radiation treatment . Patients receive continued chemotherapy follow initial radiation treatment eligible regardless recent chemotherapy receive . Those patient receive prior radiation therapy constitute Cohort A receive stereotactic body radiation ( SBRT ) 5 gray ( Gy ) x 5 . Patients previously undergone radiation therapy history treatment either chemotherapy ( unresectable/borderline resectable disease ) combination surgery chemotherapy ( resectable disease ) . Patients history prior radiation treatment constitute Cohort B receive SBRT 6.6 Gy x 5 . Please note patient must receive least two cycle chemotherapy ( selection drug discretion treat oncologist ) SBRT treatment protocol . Acceptable organ marrow function define ( within 2 week prior radiotherapy ) : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/μL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500μL Platelets &gt; 100,000/μL Total Bilirubin ≤1.5x institutional upper limit normal Aspartate transaminase ( AST ( SGOT ) ) /Alanine transaminase ( ALT ( SGPT ) ) &lt; 2.5x institutional upper limit normal Creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Radioopaque marker must present within tumor bed . In patient undergone surgical resection , radioopaque surgical clip within tumor bed use fiducials . Patients without surgical clip tumor bed must able fiducials place endoscopically , laparoscopically , CT ultrasoundguided technique . If , tumor must posterior adjacent aorta , treatment permit discretion Principal Investigator . Exclusion Criteria Age &lt; 18 year . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( infection require systemic antibiotic treatment ) , active upper GI ulceration hemorrhage , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Any concurrent malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer , noninvasive bladder cancer , early stage prostate cancer , carcinoma situ cervix . Patients previous nonpancreatic , nonperiampullary malignancy without evidence disease &gt; 5 year allow enter trial . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude woman childbearing potential unwilling unable use acceptable method birth control ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) avoid pregnancy duration study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately .
