	<brief_summary>Guillain-Barré syndrome ( GBS ) common form acute flaccid paralysis incidence high low-income country . In Bangladesh , GBS patient poor . Therefore patient afford expensive specific treatment like intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) plasmapheresis ( PE ) part explain high mortality disability compare treated patient high-income country . Added difficulty traditional PE unavailability specialize device manpower dependency . Most research GBS conduct high-income country , largely patient demyelinate form GBS . Axonal form GBS common low-income Asian country different pathogenesis , clinical course outcome demyelinate form . Very therapeutic study conduct low-income country due expensive exist modality treatment . Here , investigator propose SVPE treatment GBS patient low-income country . SVPE relatively cheap , do bedside without special device electricity eventually expect help poor severely affected GBS patient underdevelop develop country . The main outcome safety feasibility SVPE since yet establish resource limited setting . To able evaluate safety SVPE , additional information acquire frequency complication non-GBS patient central line , treat time period study facility GBS patient . Severe sepsis due central line associate blood stream infection deep venous thrombosis limb central venous catheter insert follow SVPE procedure , define severe adverse effect ( SAE ) consider primary outcome measure safety . Blood , cerebrospinal fluid relevant biological specimen analyse diagnosis screen infection . In addition clinical neurological outcome assessment monitor discharge patient hospital four week since study entry . Confirmation feasibility safety , eventually lead randomize control trial future primary focus clinical efficacy SVPE treatment GBS develop country alternative conventional treatment IVIg PE .</brief_summary>

All tube make air free fluid column respective bag . The tri channel attach central venous catheter . Procedure SVPE GBS patient : After SVPE set prepared , patient 's whole blood drawn central venous catheter accord body weight ( 7 ml/kg ) session blood transfusion bag gravitation force place blood bag central venous catheter tip level . The blood column transfusion set central venous catheter clear normal saline mixed heparin solution attach previously side channel . The blood bag hang beside patient saline stand uninterrupted separate plasma blood cell eventually take 2.5 hour gravitation . Blood cell infuse back patient plasma discard replace Fresh Frozen Plasma ( FFP ) colloid solution alternately equal volume side channel . One blood bag use day 6 session . At begin session 70 ml heparin solution take blood bag heparin mixed normal saline anticoagulant . Six session do daily consecutive 8 day . A total 48 session do eight day . These six session small volume plasma exchange per day adult patient remove approximately 1200 ml plasma daily eventually 9600 ml plasma remove total 48 session . All connection port tri channel central venous catheter , blood bag saline bag disinfect use alcohol 70 % dry air sample blood ( dis ) connection . These procedure perform aseptically . Internationally , endorse guideline central venous catheter blood stream infection prevention follow throughout entire period SVPE procedure . Total active interference patient session 30 minute total daily active interference patient three hour Daily schedule 8AM , 11AM , 2PM , 5PM , 8PM 11PM . Plasma replacement do alternately use fresh frozen plasma colloid solution ( Hexa ethyl starch ) . Anticoagulation therapy : A load subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin ( 1.5 mg/kg ) give least two hour onset SVPE . Thereafter daily maintenance dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin ( 1.5 mg/kg ) continue eight day SVPE complete . Indication anti-platelet therapy : Patients excessive clot tendency despite receive low molecular weight heparin subject evaluation platelet activation . If bleeding time reduce &gt; 50 % baseline particular GBS patient , investigator introduce anti-platelet medication . A loading oral dose aspirin ( 500 mg ) clopidogrel ( 600 mg ) give least two hour next session SVPE . Thereafter daily maintenance dose oral aspirin ( 150 mg ) clopidogrel ( 75 mg ) along subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin ( 1.5 mg/kg ) continue eight day SVPE complete . Documentation SVPE procedure : To define safety SVPE , six daily session SVPE document term duration amount plasma remove session , type volume replacement fluid fresh frozen plasma use , inconvenience compromise SVPE session temporarily permanently .
