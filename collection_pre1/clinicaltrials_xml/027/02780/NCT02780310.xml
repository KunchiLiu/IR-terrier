	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , drug lenvatinib patient adenoid cystic carcinoma . This type cancer study call phase II study . Researchers hope learn study drug shrink cancer least one-quarter compare present size . Lenvatinib oral medication interfere cancer cell growth reduce growth blood vessel around tumor . This study help find lenvatinib useful drug treat patient adenoid cystic carcinoma .</brief_summary>

The definition adequate contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Subject must able swallow retain oral medication . Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , definitive radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization ) study treatment . Concurrent therapy bisphosphonates denosumab bone metastasis allow . Palliative radiation nontarget lesion also allow . Prior use lenvatinib .
