	<brief_summary>Asthma common chronic disease child . A short ( 3-5 day ) course short-acting steroid Prednisone Prednisolone long standard care asthma exacerbation . Dexamethasone efficacy asthma exacerbation study outpatient set found effective Prednisone . Dexamethasone advantage shorter course , compliance , tolerable . This lead many emergency department provide 1-2 dose course Dexamethasone discharge . Thus , many inpatient receive first dose Dexamethasone prior reach inpatient unit , leading confusion best plan patient . Many hospitalist pediatrician continue give 5-day total course Prednisone , patient begin receive second dose Dexamethasone 24 hour first dose . To knowledge , study do compare efficacy two protocol pediatric patient require hospitalization . The hypothesis second dose Dexamethasone effective four additional day Prednisone hospitalize child asthma exacerbation . This open label , randomize control study compare treatment child age 2-18 hospitalized asthma exacerbation receive first dose Dexamethasone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids first-line therapy manage acute asthma exacerbation . Studies show systemic steroid effect decrease relapse hospital admission . Due short half-life , Prednisone usually give daily twice daily 3-5 day . It associate poor compliance due prolong course . Dexamethasone half-life 36 - 72 hour . Several study show difference outcome 3-5 day prednisone different form dexamethasone , include single intramuscular dose single oral dose two oral dos 1 day apart . However , study do emergency department ( ED ) . Lack response initial asthma treatment ED result admission hospital , imply severe exacerbation able discharge . Some clinician shift oral prednisone admit floor patient receive Dexamethasone . Others begin complete Dexamethasone course one dose Dexamethasone 24 hour first dose . Dexamethasone advantage compliance tolerability , however , study investigate efficacy hospitalized patient . Such knowledge improve patient 's compliance outcome . - Sample size calculation : Primary outcome return normal activity within 3 day discharge . Based previous study , estimate 70 % control group achieve goal . Based minimum absolute difference 15 % , power 0.80 , sample size calculate 117 arm . Assuming 20 % lose follow , intend recruit 150 arm ( total 300 subject ) . - Statistical Analysis : Demographics analyzed ensure experimental control group equivalent baseline . All proportion test Chi-square Fisher exact test two-sample T-test use continuous variable . Î± = 0.05 used hypothesis test . Interim analysis perform monthly study halt safety concern arise . The Center Health Equity Quality Research ( CHEQR ) help statistical analysis - Data Safety Monitoring Plan : The study PI co-investigator meet review collect data monthly basis identify interim result may require change study protocol . Information may affect subject ' safety communicate appropriate party timely fashion .</detailed_description>
