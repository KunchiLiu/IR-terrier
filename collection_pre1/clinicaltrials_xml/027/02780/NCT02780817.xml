	<detailed_description>A single process involve motor learn adaptation . Hand reach movement extensively use evaluate concept motor adaptation . By induce systematic perturbation hand , possible examine implicit motor response trajectory hand . Error-augmentation ( EA ) train relatively new concept motor learn intend promote adaptation process . Applying perturbating force hand shift hand trajectory form straight line curve like shape . Making repetitive movement condition result gradual correction faulty movement trajectory toward straight line , e.g . motor adaptation . Participants : Healthy volunteer , age 20-50 , male female . The participant randomly assign two group : study control group . Procedure : One practice session 25 minute 3D robotic device . The study group carry session EA force . The control group carry train without EA force . Outcome Measures : Size trajectory error straight line , level exertion .</detailed_description>
