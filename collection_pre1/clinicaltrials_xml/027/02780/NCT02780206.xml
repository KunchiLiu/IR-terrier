	<detailed_description>The overarch hypothesis baseline , pre- post-diet combination 'omics ' signature response food nutrient explain weight loss response obese subject low calorie ( VLC ) diet . In order address general hypothesis follow specific aim address : Specific Aim 1 : To test hypothesis combination 'omics ' parameter response define meal discriminate morbidly obese subject . Specific Aim 2 : To test hypothesis variation % weight loss 2-weeks VLC diet related baseline genomic marker , gene expression profile , proteomic metabolomic signature well baseline metabolic substrate fluxomics response define meal . Specific Aim 3 : To test hypothesis variation % weight loss 4-weeks VLC diet related baseline genomic marker , gene expression profile , proteomic metabolomic signature well baseline metabolic substrate fluxomics response define meal .</detailed_description>
