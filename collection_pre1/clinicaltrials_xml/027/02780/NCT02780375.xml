	<detailed_description>Biological marker radiation exposure play crucial role triage suspect exposed person follow radiation accident incident . They also estimate individual dos enable assessment late radiation effect affected individual . In recent year gene expression assay show sensitive biological marker radiation exposure potential use truly individualised dosimetry . The possibility gene expression assay use large scale mass-casualty scenario propose test recent intercomparison exercise . Classic cytogenetic technique , particular gold standard dicentric assay , two main disadvantage : ( 1 ) lack high-throughput ( 2 ) delay several day blood sample availability result . Although work need do assess suitability triage purpose , clear gene expression analysis blood sample provide valuable information , window time ( i.e . 12-48 hour ) follow radiation exposure specific radiation-responsive gene linear dose response ( 0-5 Gy ) . Most work date focus develop sensitive assay study gene expression modification use state art technology , i.e . multiplex quantitative , digital polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) molecular count system . At Public Health England ( PHE ) , recently establish technology allow direct count nucleic acid molecule ( DNA , mRNA , miRNA lncRNA ) without need enzymatic reaction amplification step hence reduce time data collection . The system offer multiplexing capacity comparable microarrays great precision sensitivity . Another unique advantage technology need long , time consume bioinformatic analysis result obtain counted number event . This new gene expression analysis technique assess radiation biodosimetry application promising result . Furthermore , gene expression show high degree promise marker late effect radiation , instance normal tissue reaction follow curative radiotherapy breast cancer . Clinical data suggest systemic inflammatory response play critical role progression radiation effect : instance , neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio represent marker systemic inflammation pre-treatment independent prognostic factor useful individual risk assessment breast cancer patient undergo radiotherapy . Genes relevant inflammatory response thus interest candidate investigation . Linearity transcriptional dose-response specific radiation-responsive gene ex vivo expose human blood sample recently demonstrate first time , inter-individual variability response low dos high dos exposures newly assess . The logical next stage biological development gene expression assay validate new technique human blood sample expose radiation vivo . The use sample patient undergo radiotherapy validation technique gain popularity recent year . Sophisticated treatment plan clinical radiotherapy lead accurate individual dose calculation allow validation biological estimate dose . The range standard radiotherapy schedule choose inclusion study provide wide range dos assessment gene expression assay alone combination cytogenetic assay , simulate range potential exposure scenario . Peripheral blood sample take informed consent patient undergo standard radiotherapy treatment breast , lung , gastrointestinal genitourinary tumour . Responses panel 800 cod non-coding RNAs assess sample use nCounter system . Candidate gene identify PHE , Columbia and/or literature specific radiation response include , together gene relevant systemic inflammatory response , identify transcriptional response range dos exposures inter-individual basis . Data analyse use exist new statistical tool focus count data modelling . The intended outcome identification radiation specific panel gene inform individual radiation response result favourable , large scale follow propose pilot expect due course .</detailed_description>
