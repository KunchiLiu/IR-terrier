	<brief_title>Cardio-respiratory Responses During Hypoxic Exercise Individuals Born Prematurely</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study protocol age group comprise two visit laboratory testing session randomize order . On one occasion participant perform rest hypoxia test grade exercise test voluntary exhaustion normoxic condition ( ( NORM ; fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) =0.209 , placebo ) . On second visit participant perform hypoxia sensitivity test grade exercise test voluntary exhaustion hypoxic condition ( HYPO ; FiO2=0.120 correspond terrestrial altitude approx . 4000 ) . Indirect calorimetry , near infrared spectroscopy ECG measurement perform throughout test . During test session participant also undergo anthropometry measurement pulmonary function test . The outline research visit present bellow figure :</detailed_description>
