	<brief_title>Airvo/Optiflow High Flow Nasal Oxygenation During Microlaryngeal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Optiflow high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) oxygenation suitable technique oxygenation ventilation ( apnoeic ventilation ) patient undergo microlaryngeal surgery . Aims : 1 . Measure continuous pulse oximetry ( oxygenation ) intermittent subglottic catheter sample end tidal carbon dioxide level ( ventilation ) distal trachea HFNC oxygenation 2 . Measure intra-tracheal airway pressure HFNC oxygenation Methodology : As pilot study , investigator recruit 20 patient within 12 month period schedule elective microlaryngeal surgery high frequency jet ventilation . Standard monitor standard conduct anaesthesia carry : induction general anaesthesia , insertion narrow catheter trachea insertion laryngeal mask airway . In addition , study device ( HFNC ) place entrance patient 's nostril . After removal laryngeal mask , HFNC oxygenation commence . A surgical suspension laryngoscope insert microlaryngeal surgery ( standard technique ) . The investigator measure adequacy gas exchange , HFNC oxygenation complication ( cardiovascular , airway respiratory ) . Data store secure REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) system . Importance : HFNC oxygenation novel technique depend apnoeic oxygenation . Even though patient paralyse breathing , oxygenation carbon dioxide clearance still occur . This due difference alveolar rate oxygen removal carbon dioxide excretion generate negative pressure gradient . Oxygenation patient therefore due high inspiratory fraction oxygen , apnoeic ventilation small continuous positive airway pressure cause high flow gas . This pressure increase lung volume recruit collapse alveoli . Carbon dioxide clearance due gas mix flush airway dead space . The additional humidification high flow oxygen prevents mucociliary damage airway . HFNC show beneficial pre-oxygenation , oxygenation extubation , treatment respiratory failure heart failure . New use difficult airway management emerge . However , main case series HFNC use difficult airway measure intra-operative airway pressure end tidal oxygen carbon dioxide ; gas measure end surgery definitive airway insert . As far investigator aware , data intra-operative , intra-tracheal airway pressure oxygen carbon dioxide HFNC oxygenation . Our study aim fill knowledge gap . Potential benefit risk : The use HFNC remove obstacle form surgical field may make surgery easy quicker perform . Risks include : fail gas exchange , minimize abandon HFNC oxygenation institute tracheal catheter jet ventilation via situ jet catheter ( standard practice ) .</detailed_description>
