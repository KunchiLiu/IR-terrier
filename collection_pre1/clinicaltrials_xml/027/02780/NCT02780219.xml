	<detailed_description>In study , follow hypothesis test : A bout resistance exercise affect acute 24h response whole-body protein amino acid metabolism cognitive function compare baseline value COPD patient healthy subject . To , subject complete baseline visit receive stable amino acid tracer . The next day complete one-time resistance exercise immediate measurement amino acid tracer , return 24 hour exercise repeat amino acid tracer measurement . This project provide important clinical information whole body protein amino acid metabolic response acute resistance exercise elderly subject COPD , well , exercise induce change physical cognitive function , absolute muscular strength capacity population . In way , study provide preliminary data development standardize , repeatable resistance exercise protocols stop process ongoing muscle loss improve metabolism function COPD subject .</detailed_description>
