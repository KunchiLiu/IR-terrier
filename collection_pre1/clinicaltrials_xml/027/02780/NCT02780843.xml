	<brief_summary>Acute stroke occur approximately 13.000 person every year Denmark , 10 - 15 % receive intervenous thrombolytic therapy , remain important acute treatment ischaemic stroke . For decade ongoing discussion Computerized Tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) best thrombolysis : Magnetic Resonance Imaging superior visualise ischaemia , Computerized Tomography quicker easily applicable . In investigator centre primary imaging work acute stroke work hour alternate Computerized Tomography Magnetic Resonance Imaging day base fix calendar 24 month period quality development project . This study plan include patient acute stroke imagining period , total 600 patient expect . The investigator compare door-to-needle time , patient safety , quality imaging , patient ' experience , physician ' decision certainty , use recourse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT MRI Work i.v . Thrombolysis : Single-centre Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Stroke remain third lead cause death first lead cause handicap adult age high-income country even causal revascularisation therapy ( intervenous ( i.v ) thrombolysis endovascular therapy ( EVT ) become generally available . I.v . thrombolysis implement routine treatment within 4.5 hour symptom onset base evidence randomise controlled trial . Treatment benefit highly dependent time symptom onset treatment therefore strongly related organisational issue include selection image modality . I.v thrombolysis registration base trial use non-contrast Computerized Tomography ( CT ) . In , general however , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) consider imply higher standard care . MRI consider give detailed information improve patient safety . The issue CT MRI 'best ' i.v . thrombolysis work-up discuss stroke scientist decade , nationally internationally . MRI superior detect acute ischaemia CT quicker ; effect choice image modality overall efficacy safety remain determined spite completion 74.000 i.v . thrombolysis treatment Europe accord SITS-MOST registry . Access primary work MRI frequently regard token high treatment quality ; nevertheless , centre worldwide really primarily MRI base . CT much fast contraindication . This may crucial efficacy thrombolysis decrease time treatment - number need treat increase 1 every 20 minute , make question MRI academic interest relevant question . The aim study determine choice primary imaging modality ( CT v MRI ) affect efficacy safety i.v . thrombolysis open quasi-randomised design , image allocation allocate base date admission . The following item compare : 1 . Radiological exclusion cause symptom acute cerebral ischemia 2 . Contraindications scan method term contrast magnetism 3 . Delay admission thrombolytic treatment minute 4 . Radiological imaging diagnostic quality 5 . Identification stroke mechanism accord TOAST classification 6 . Visual Analogue Scale patient experience admission radiological examination 7 . Visual Analogue Scale treat physician 's experience decision support prior prescription thrombolytic treatment 8 . Deviation radiological Standard Operational Plan 9 . Time consumption radiologists radiographer minute Method : Patients admit acute stroke office hour possibly also daytime weekend Bispebjerg University Hospital include study 24 month study period . Based activity 2011 , investigator expect study population 600 patient . Door needle time parameter/endpoint strongest associate prognosis therefore relevant patient 's point view . This estimate well within plan sample size . However , sample size extend order allow analysis le well-defined endpoint include patient experience . - Study procedure : Patients evaluate accord usual standard neurological outcome ( National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) ) perform admission Day 1 . Risk factor co-morbidities record stroke mechanism evaluate . The patient carers contact telephone approximately 3 month . Recurrence stroke , Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) , Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) cardiac revascularization procedure register . If patient diseased , time death cause death extract patient file . The functional outcome assess modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) ( include death ) . - Patient experience scan : The patient ask day 1 experience scan procedure use visual analogue scale . - The physician ' certainty make right decision concern thrombolysis : The doctor note use visual analogue scale ( 0-10 ) strength clinical decision give give tissue Plasminogen Activator ( tPA ) immediately bolus , patient inform indicate . - Resource use : Time arrival treatment initiation record . Potential deviation resource consumption derogate SOP account . - Data Analysis : Imaging evaluate acute phase . Further , diagnostic image systematically retrospectively evaluate two senior neuroradiological consultant blind clinical information except side symptom . X2-test , t-test/Mann-Whitney-test use depend distribution material , well uni multivariate logistic regression analysis . It test age , gender severity affect result . Data relating risk factor co-morbidity use characterize patient population . Function 3 month express mRS assess , study design able detect eventual difference level function 3 month . Ethical consideration : All patient work accord best clinical practice accordance Danish , European American guideline . As study procedure add interview patient experience radiological procedure follow-up MRI , do case contraindication MRI patient 's request . Further data risk factor , stroke event follow record . There know risk relate MRI person magnetic metal body ( e.g . pacemaker ) ; exclude procedure clinical practice . The confined space noise MRI-scanner may cause anxiety ; prevent handle experienced radiographer clinical practice . Overall , expect risk participation study chance treatment benefit additional follow-up MRI . The study may considerable impact future treatment patient acute stroke may provide clarification method future primary strategy . Patient experience well physicians experience include analysis . Economy : The study fully finance grant Tryg Fonden . The applicant research responsible relation foundation . Importance relevance study : If choice image method significantly affect predictor good outcome thrombolytic therapy initial use superior method would lead benefit , individual patient correspond less disability stroke . Study result implement directly clinical practice ; think subject eventual need revise allocation resource even though total number scan affect . Based study 's registration resource consumption , health economic effect study estimate . Since stroke common serious disorder , relatively minor improvement prognosis may noticeable effect group community level . Further , study may close long-standing sometimes emotional scientific discussion , set example trial remain valid method answer scientific question . This set research protocol complement quality project enable u evaluate issue .</detailed_description>
