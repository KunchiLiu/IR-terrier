	<detailed_description>Therapy Omegaven initiate maintain 1 g/kg/day subject parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis prolong parenteral nutrition dependence qualify expand access . It infuse intravenously either central peripheral catheter conjunction parenteral nutrition . If additional non-protein calorie need , provide carbohydrate . No parenteral form fat emulsion use Omegaven therapy unless subject receive adequate calorie additional dextrose may administer subject severe persistent hyperglycemia , respiratory compromise , clinical condition , unless patient develop essential fatty acid deficiency confirm laboratory parameter . The standard care provide subject receive parenteral nutrition solution follow . Regular PN monitoring accomplish analyze clinical laboratory parameter , include serum electrolyte , hematological study , renal function , hepatic function , blood clotting factor , protein nutrition status trace mineral status . An essential fatty acid profile lipid panel sample subject monitor effect Omegaven . Blood sample essential fatty acid profile lipid panel begin Omegaven , weekly patient Omegaven direct ( conjugate ) bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL , monthly patient Omegaven direct ( conjugate ) bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL . Subjects also monitor daily clinical sign symptom essential fatty acid deficiency , include dermatitis hair loss . Dose reduction titration discontinuation occur evidence hypertriglyceridemia ( serum triglyceride &gt; 200 mg/dL ) , allergic response , toxicity evidence bleed believe caused worsen Omegaven . If lipid intolerance develops , define serum triglyceride level &gt; 200 mg/dL , lipid stop least 4 hour repeat serum triglyceride level obtain . If triglyceride continue remain high dosage reduction 25 % current dose consider . Growth index include weight , length , head circumference also monitor . The Omegaven dose may discontinue subject receive adequate enteral nutrition meet metabolic growth need . Subjects receive follow-up visit per customary medical ( GI ) surgical follow-up schedule period 36 month discontinuation Omegaven . Follow visit occur least annually , may frequent base subject ' tolerance weight gain enteral nutrition . As previously mention , Omegaven infuse manner conventional fat emulsion either central peripheral line . The emulsion isotonic . It compatible parenteral nutrition solution may co-infused via y-site . Source container change every 24 hour unused product discard . Omegaven may infuse 1.2 micron inline filter .</detailed_description>
