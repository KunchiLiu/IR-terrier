	<brief_title>Outcome Measures Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy : A Natural History Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel emerge therapy Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) require deep understanding DMD natural history . This study aim assess natural history DMD composite assessment tool capable capture disease progression link ambulant non-ambulant phase disease . With recruitment target 80 DMD patient across 5 centre ( London , Newcastle , Paris , Leiden , Nijmegen ) , subject assess 6 monthly accord share protocol . Assessments include 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) , North Star Ambulatory Assessment ( NSAA ) , Performance Upper Limb ( PUL ) MyoSet ( myogrip , myopinch moviplate ) . Both ambulant non-ambulant subject undergo upper limb evaluation respiratory function test include force vital capacity ( FVC ) , maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure ( MIP/MEP ) . A subgroup patient perform annual whole body DEXA scan . An image sub-study aim characterize muscle ( upper/lower limb ) brain MRI . The investigator analyze longitudinal data different assessment tool explore correlation among . This study offer comprehensive natural history DMD include novel outcome measure , allow capture disease progression explore relationship different assessment tool .</detailed_description>
