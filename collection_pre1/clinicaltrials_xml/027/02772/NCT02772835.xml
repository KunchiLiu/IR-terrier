	<brief_title>nHFOV v nCPAP : Effects Gas Exchange Treatment Neonates Recovering From RDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infants usually develop respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) , due lung immaturity , surfactant deficiency immature respiratory control mechanism ( 1 ) . Even though mechanical ventilation frequently lifesaving , complication common ( 2 ) . Tracheal intubation mechanical ventilation associate ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) airway inflammation , lead bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) ( 3 ) . The mechanisms injury involve alveolar distension , presence shear force release pro-inflammatory cytokine ( 6 ) , moreover prolonged duration intubation mechanical ventilation associate increased risk death survival neurologic impairment ( 3 ) . In effort reduce VILI BPD premature infant , trend toward increase use non-invasive form respiratory support : nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) , nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) , high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) , nasal high-frequency oscillatory ventilation ( nasal-HFOV ) ( 2 , 1 , 7 ) . NCPAP alternative intubation meta-analysis trial early nasal CPAP versus intubation ventilation show nasal CPAP reduces risk BPD . Nonetheless use NCPAP delivery room may fail ELBW , 34 83 % infant require subsequent intubation . Furthermore , post extubation support nCPAP infant associate 16-40 % failure rate 1 week ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 ) . NCPAP stabilize surfactant deficient alveolus improve oxygenation , necessarily improve alveolar ventilation partial pressure carbon dioxide ( pCO2 ) elimination ( 2 , 8 ) . Some Authors report use nasal high-frequency ventilation ( nHFOV ) 14 low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants respiratory failure , use nasopharyngeal tube ( 3 ) show technique lower pCO2 ( 1 ) . Other Authors investigate efficacy nasal HFOV apply single nasopharyngeal tube heterogeneous group 21 infant moderate respiratory insufficiency show effective reduce pCO2 ( 10 ) . No randomized control trial directly evaluate efficacy nasal HFOV versus nCPAP use nasal prongs/mask ELBW . There rationale support idea high-frequency oscillation use nasal prong may improve carbon dioxide elimination infant minimize need intubation mechanical ventilation . In premature infant , HFOV believe cause less lung injury conventional ventilation . So question whether benefit HFOV non invasive ( nasal ) ventilation synergistic . End-point - Our first end-point short-term application nasal HFOV compare nasal continuous airway pressure ( nCPAP ) infant persistent oxygen ( O2 ) need recover RDS would improve CO2 removal . We also hypothesize use nHFOV reduce inspire fraction O2 ( FiO2 ) level require maintain normal percutaneous saturation O2 ( SpO2 ) level . Design - Multi-center non-blinded , randomize , observational four period crossover study Setting/population Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) : very-low birth weight infant ( &lt; 1500 g ) and/or gestational age &lt; 32 week require nCPAP oxygen recover RDS . Methods - Infants require nasal CPAP ( 4-8 cm H2O ) &gt; 24 hour prior study enrolment , FiO2 0.21 , randomize either nCPAP nHFOV deliver Medin-CNO device . A crossover design four 1 h treatment period use infant receive treatment twice . Oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) , transcutaneous CO2 ( tcCO2 ) O2 ( tcO2 ) vital sign monitor continuously . Cardio-respiratory monitor recording analyze apnoea , bradycardia oxygen desaturations . Study - After write informed consent obtain , patient place supine position . A transcutaneous CO2 O2 monitor well pneumocardiography sensor place infant monitor . The patient randomize seal envelope shuffle start treatment mode either nCPAP ( 4-8 cm H2O , CPAP level use prior enter study ) nHFOV follow start parameter : CPAP level : 4-8 cm H2O CPAP level use prior enter study ; Flow : 7-10 l/min ( provide desire CPAP level ) ; Frequency : 10 Hz , Amplitude : 10 , ( eventually modify obtain tcPCO2 value normal range ( 45-65 mmHg ; 5.9-8.6 kPa ) . Short binasal prong right size always use . Prior enter study patient receive caffeine . All support deliver Medin-cno device . Research personnel adjust FiO2 attain target oxygen saturation 87-94 % . The patient maintain usual thermoneutral environment ( incubator ) throughout study , receive standard routine care primary care team . At study initiation , infant start randomize start mode either nCPAP nHFOV . The study consist four 1 h study block , alternate initial mode alternate mode twice . During study neonate monitor continuously cardio-respiratory monitor , pulse oximeter transcutaneous gas monitoring . All data record continuously 1-min interval directly monitor and/or observe directly experienced neonatologist manually record respiratory sheet . During study block , follow data record : transcutaneous partial pressure CO2 ( tcPCO2 ) , transcutaneous partial pressure O2 ( tcPO2 ) , heart rate , respiratory rate , SaO2 , Silverman score . Apnoeic episode define absence thoracic impedance change minimum 20 s. Bradycardic episode define persistent heart rate &lt; 80 beat per minute minimum 10 . Significant desaturation episode define persistent pulse oximetry value &lt; 80 % minimum 10 . Manual blood pressure take appropriate sized neonatal blood pressure cuff 30 minute begin treatment block . Immediately enter study , begin first study period , transcutaneous monitoring TcPCO2 TcPO2 start capillary blood gas analysis ( BGA ) perform order test reliability TcPCO2 data . A second capillary BGA perform end second study period CPAP nHFOV . Cerebral ( cer-rSO2 ) renal ( ren-rSO2 ) tissue oxygenation measure near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) additional variable study period , base instrument 's availability participating center . The study end patient complete 4 h study terminate early patient develop sign intolerance study , include increase &gt; 50 % number episodes apnea bradycardia compare prestudy baseline note 1 h precede study entry , increase supplemental FiO2 &gt; 0.3 pre-study baseline least 15 min ( i.e . 0.30 0.60 ) . To allow equilibration , group analyze data point last 20 min treatment block . A sample size 30 calculate detect mean difference 3 mmHg tcCO2 base two-tailed p value 0.05 , power 0.9 within-patient standard deviation ( SD ) 2.5 mmHg ( 2 ) . Duration study - To define , depend number participate NICUs . Compliance protocol - Compliance define full adherence protocol . Compliance protocol ensure number procedure describe . Site set-up - Local principal investigator participate preparatory meeting detail study protocol , data collection procedure accurately discuss . All center receive detailed write instruction web base record data , , solve possible difficulty , possible contact Chief investigator . Moreover , ascertain procedure equally make participate center . Data processing monitoring - All study data 1 . Screened out-of-range data , cross-checks conflict data within data collection form data manager . 2 . Referred back relevant centre clarification event miss item uncertainty . The Chief Investigator trial statistician review result generate logic pattern problem . Outlier data investigate . Safety - Safety end-point measure include incidence , severity , causality report serious adverse effect ( SAE ) , namely change occurrence expect common prematurity complication clinical laboratory test assessment , development unexpected SAEs high risk population . All SAEs follow satisfactory resolution investigator responsible care participant deem event chronic patient stable . All expect unexpected SAEs , whether attributable study intervention , review local principal investigator determine reasonable suspect causal relationship intervention . If relationship reasonable SAEs report Chief Investigators report Ethics Committee inform investigator guaranty safety participant .</detailed_description>
