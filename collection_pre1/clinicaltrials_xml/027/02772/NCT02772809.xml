	<detailed_description>TheraDrive low-cost robotic system post-stroke upper extremity rehabilitation . The system use off-the-shelf computer game wheel force feedback help reduce motor impairment improve function arm stroke survivor . Preliminary result various study show original TheraDrive system lack robust mechanical linkage could withstand force exerted patient , lack patient-specific adaptive controller deliver personalize therapy , capable deliver effective therapy severely low-functioning patient . A new low-cost , high-force haptic robot single degree freedom develop address concern . This study two purpose : first , test viability usability new robot system alongside original TheraDrive system ; second , test low-functioning patient benefit , much , use force-feedback therapy oppose device zero impedance . This do recruiting approximately 36 human subject . Exercises perform study subject adaptive controller monitor patient performance ensure exercise difficult doable , important maintain patient motivation . It hypothesize new system viable , provide good robot-assisted therapy large variety patient , especially low-functioning stroke survivor hemiplegia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stroke survivor least 18 year age hemiplegia . The subject 's stroke must occur least 3 month prior enrollment study . Low Moderate function stroke survivor measure Fugl Meyer Not depress No Mild Cognitive Deficit Participants must able sit upright 4 hour time Part A study ; 2 hour time , 3 day week , Part B study . The subject 's stroke must occur least 3 month prior enrollment study . Greater mild cognitive deficit Greater mild depression . A member research team administer Beck 's Depression Inventory ( BDI ) study participant phone . If participant find great mild depression , measure BDI , qualify study . Receiving rehabilitation upper limb . Received Botox injection within past 3 month . Suffering contracture ( chronic loss joint motion ) debilitate spasticity upper extremity . Experiencing great mild pain , and/or PI determine participant longer continue work novel therapy device , study stop .</criteria>
