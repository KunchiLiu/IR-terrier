In order reduce diagnostic delay , important investigate health care utilization decision make healthcare professional period final diagnosis make . This study prospectively include patient two centre Denmark patient treat IPF thus good opportunity include majority incident case IPF Denmark . Patients include immediately diagnosis reduces recall bias . The database include patient report data objective data national registry patient record . A main focus distribution diagnostic delay patient different health care provider , health care utilization patient diagnosis IPF make . Risk factor delay diagnosis investigate . The importance diagnostic delay prognosis course disease also investigate . The database create study also use future research IPF .</detailed_description>
