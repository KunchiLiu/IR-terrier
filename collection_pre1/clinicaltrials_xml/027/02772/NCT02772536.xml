	<brief_summary>Background An early pilot study provide evidence 40 % tinnitus sufferer report view particular tint light appear result improvement tinnitus . This ameliorative effect appear primarily acute report occur whilst view tint . Individual patient would choose differ tint identify one tint affect tinnitus . Aim Study In current basic science study , aim provide preliminary data return estimate efficacy use tint light ameliorate tinnitus . After identification responder screen , responder invite attend three trial session , tinnitus assess response three luminance condition : Low Ambient Light ; Tint Light affect Tinnitus ; White Light . The response low ambient light serf control compare effect tint light response white light serf 'active ' stimulus comparator . These result establish whether tinted light provide patient useful improvement tinnitus compare measure baseline tinnitus obtain dark standardise white light stimulus . They also inform development technique potential treatment tinnitus responsive patient . Over three session , average response give patient stimulus condition analyse provide measure efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Investigating Effect Tinted Light Perception Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Protocol The overall study design open , participant explicitly require identify specific light tint perceive affect annoyance intrusiveness tinnitus . An element active control provide reference change report self-selected tint reference white light . The priori assumption optically define white light , report change tinnitus remain zero . The following protocol outline trial experience participant . All trial data anonymised hard copy securely hold trial site . Invitation participate seek consent First Visit : Questionnaires Screening identify Tinnitus patient report whose perception tinnitus change tinted light . Trial Questionnaires Following consent take part study , first visit participant complete two questionnaire . This provide relevant baseline demographic , history general health tinnitus hearing . The second questionnaire Oregon Tinnitus Functional Index ( TFI ) ass impact tinnitus participant 's life . Light Test Screening : Identification Tints Affecting Tinnitus Perception The follow take place sound proof room Leicester Royal Infirmary participant comfortably seat session . After explanation ask , patient ask provide Tinnitus Annoyance Tinnitus Loudness VAS value serve baseline measurement . The source illumination experimental procedure Light Emitting Diode ( LED ) lamp front patient indirect low level ambient illumination laptop screen . The laptop screen view experimenter display see participant . The LED lamp consist three bank Red , Green Blue ( RGB ) LEDs direct manual computer control . The Lamp head project onto A4 size platen form base lamp . On platen base , A4 sheet white paper illuminate calibrate output RGB LED . The participant comfortably seat asked look default set white illuminate calibrate LED lamp . This distance 45-50 cm . The participant control colour output LED lamp vary three independent manual dial , one Red , Green Blue LEDs produce wide range light tint . A demonstration practice explanation experimenter provide prior commencing procedure . During screening procedure , patient ask report tint see appear improve tinnitus . The individual RGB value tint report participant record experimenter . The degree improvement estimate patient reporting Tinnitus Annoyance Loudness VAS rating describe Clinical Global Index ( CGI ) value describe . If identify one tinnitus ameliorate tint , invite replicate setting return default optical white . The RGB dial calibration marking , connect laptop monitor colour space generate . This experimenter control . The individual RGB value tint report participant record experimenter along two Tinnitus VAS CGI value . The experimenter also establish choose tint replicate independently computer control gradually change RGB value replicate tint ( ) along record VAS CGI value describe . Importantly , verbal feedback experimenter tint choice give guide assume active tint choice effect participant tinnitus . Once replication establish first screen session participant invite attend three session provide evidence stability long term effect necessary demonstrate efficacy . Second Fourth Visit : Estimating Efficacy On visit , participant invite back soundproof room seat comfortably front LED lamp . At start second session , patient ask provide baseline VAS rating tinnitus loudness annoyance . At second visit , patient invite choose consider optimal tint fro improve tinnitus first visit . The optimal tint affect tinnitus replicate patient independently experimenter . Once confirm optimal choice , set noted experimenter presentation . The patient present three set visual stimulus condition ass efficacy . Low level ambient lighting : - Under low level illumination patient ask provide VAS CGI rating tinnitus three occasion 10 minute 0,5 10 min . These value record experimenter . Optimal tint - Patients view optimal light tint present 20 minute ask provide VAS CGI rating three occasion 5 , 10 15 min . At 0 20 min , i.e . optimal tint present , ask provide value condition low ambient illumination . These value record experimenter . White Light - After minute interval , patient ask repeat procedure whilst view white light serf active comparator . These value record experimenter . The third fourth visit ideally space two weekly interval , timing visit arrange fit lifestyle commitment patient . At visit , patient invite provide VAS CGI score three illumination condition describe . Once full set data four visit obtain , patient complete participation trial . The VAS CGI measurement obtain processed return primary secondary outcome measure patient end participation trial .</detailed_description>
