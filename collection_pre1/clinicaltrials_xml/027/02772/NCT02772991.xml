	<brief_summary>In recent year , large number study conduct improve treatment patient Emergency Room ( ER ) complain chest pain . Great advance achieve recently regard diagnostic method aid coronary CT angiopraphy ( CCTA ) high-sensitive troponins . However , various question method still remain obscure effective comparison patient intermediate risk . The aim study evaluate sensitivity specificity high sensitivity troponins detection coronary artery disease patient chest pain intermediate probability ACS compare CCTA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Between Coronary Angiotomography High-sensitive Troponin Intermediate Risk Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective unicentric study approximately 200 subject recruit planned recruitment period 24 month . Based alpha error 0.05 use power 0.8 primary outcome , investigator calculate number individual necessary study least 141 . All patient submmited troponin measurement CCTA . The commercial kit ADVIA Centaur® TnI-Ultra ( Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics , Tarrytown , NY , USA ) use automated equipment brand . It measure central InCor laboratory . The 99th percentile value 0.04 ng/ml . The CCTA use 320-channel Toshiba Aquilium machine . If CCTA result show coronary stenosis great equal 50 % , patient initiate ACS treatment hospitalize coronary cineangiography . In case CCTA show lesion less 50 % , patient discharge monitor 30 day telephone . This conduct already follow routine emergency unit InCor situation . A second sampling troponin kit obtain patient three hour first collection order evaluate increase/decrease troponin . This second troponin measurement , however , blind main investigator , access evaluation outcome end study . All data place Microsoft Access database table analyze SAS Statview 5.0 software . The comparative analysis method make use area ROC curve obtain sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , accuracy .</detailed_description>
