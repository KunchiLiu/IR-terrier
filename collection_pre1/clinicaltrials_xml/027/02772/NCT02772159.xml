	<brief_title>TD-4208 Absorption , Distribution , Metabolism Excretion ( ADME ) Study Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , fixed-sequence , two-period study 12 healthy male subject . The present study design fully characterize rate rout elimination TD 4208 use radiolabeled drug administer via oral IV route . This study provide information regard metabolic fate TD 4208 , need evaluation potential drug-drug interaction , need study special population absolute oral bioavailability TD-4208 . The result study allow comprehensive comparison animal human route elimination metabolic profile TD 4208 . This study conduct small number healthy male subject ( n=12 ) minimize number individual expose radioactivity . Each subject receive follow treatment : Treatment A ( Period 1 ) : 20 μg IV infusion [ 14C ] TD-4208 administer fasted state 30 minute . Treatment B ( Period 2 ) : 200 μg oral solution [ 14C ] TD-4208 administer fasted state . Blood , urine , feces , vomitus ( applicable ) collect subject release Periods 1 2 . In Periods 1 2 , subject may remain clinical research unit maximum 15 day . Between dose period 1 2 , washout interval least 28 day .</detailed_description>

Normal BP define 90 140 mm Hg systolic 50 90 mm Hg diastolic . Normal HR define 40 99 beat per minute . 3 . Subject negative hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV antibodies . 4 . Subject clinically relevant abnormality determine investigator result Screening Day 1 laboratory evaluation . 1 . Subject condition possibly affect drug absorption ( e.g. , previous surgery gastrointestinal tract [ include removal part stomach , bowel , liver , gall bladder , pancreas ] ) . 2 . Subject participate another clinical trial investigational drug ( medical device ) within 30 day ( 5 halflives investigational drug , whichever long ) prior Screening , currently participate another trial investigational drug ( medical device ) . 3 . Subject know hypersensitivity towards medication similar TD4208 excipients contain TD4208 . 4 . Subject previously participate trial TD4208 . 5 . Subject regularly work ionize radiation radioactive material . 6 . Subject expose ionizing radiation , within 1 year prior start study , external irradiation ( radiological examination include CT scan exclude dental radiography ) internal radiation ( diagnostic nuclear medicine procedure ) participate radiolabeled study last 12 month . 7 . Subject exposure external and/or internal radiotherapy open ( i.e. , nuclear medicine ) seal source ( i.e. , brachytherapy ) within last 12 month . 8 . Subject , , reason , deem investigator inappropriate study condition would confound interfere evaluation safety , tolerability , PK investigational drug prevent compliance study protocol .</criteria>
