	<brief_title>Perinatal Tissue Mesenchyme Stem Cells Treatment Caesarean Section Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nowadays , cesarean one common surgical intervention prevalence increase country recent year . Delay heal cesarean wound formation visible scar common symptom maternal morbidity cesarean section . These complication affect mother 's quality life due stress , anxiety , delay mother 's ability health recovery , also associate additional cost result increase need wide spectrum antibiotic sometimes hospitalization repeat repair wound . Improve final aspect would visible scar , challenge medicine . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) population pluripotent stem cell self-renewing capable differentiate canonical cell mesenchyme . Recently , stem cell apply regenerative medicine , even internal organ blood vessel , nerve , heart . The study investigate efficacy safety perinatal tissue mesenchyme stem cell treatment appearance caesarean scar compare similar untreated scar . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial design investigate efficacy safety perinatal tissue mesenchyme stem cell ( MSC ) treatment appearance caesarean scar compare similar untreated scar . A total ninety ( 90 ) participant randomize ( 1:1:1 ) receive MSC placebo . All participant undergo delivery lower segment caesarean section transverse abdominal incision , clear indication particular surgical technique material use . In low-dose MSC group , participant receive transdermal one dose 1*10^6 cell Perinatal Tissue Mesenchyme Stem Cells gel day continuous three day receive transdermal placebo without Perinatal Tissue Mesenchyme Stem Cells gel day continuous next three day ; In high-dose MSC group , participant receive transdermal one dose 1*10^6 cell Perinatal Tissue Mesenchyme Stem Cells gel day continuous six day ; And placebo group , participant receive transdermal placebo without Perinatal Tissue Mesenchyme Stem Cells gel day continuous six day . After randomization , baseline data , transdermal treatment , participant follow 1 month , 3 month 6 month . For purpose endpoint analysis safety evaluation , investigator utilize `` intention-to-treat '' study population .</detailed_description>
