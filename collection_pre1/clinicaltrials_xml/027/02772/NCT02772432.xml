	<detailed_description>According 2011/12 National Survey Children 's Health , 14.6 million child U.S. special health care need ( e.g. , learn disability , ADD/ADHD , developmental delay , chronic mental physical health condition ) ; CSHCN comprise 14.4 % -25.6 % child population United States . Having child special health care need ( CSHCN ) associate increase risk problem emotional physical health social well-being . Parents CSHCN also increase risk employed , financial stress , poor healthrelated quality life ( HRQoL ) . There grow literature increase level parental stress associate care CSHCN . One study find chronic stress , measure duration CSHCN , associate increase clinical aging , determine telomere ( caps end strand DNA protect chromosome age ) sequence . A review article provide comprehensive overview link high level parental stress among parent child intellectual developmental disability child health well-being . Furthermore , recent study document parent SSHCN feel socially isolate . Therefore , child special health care need ( CSHCN ) associate increase risk problem emotional physical health social well-being . Parents CSHCN also increase risk employed , financial stress , poor health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . There grow literature increase level parental stress associate care CSHCN , recent review article provide comprehensive overview link high level parental stress among parent child intellectual developmental disability child health well-being . Resiliency multidimensional construct refers ability maintain adaptation effective functioning face stressor . Resiliency provide framework understand adjustment stress dynamic process . Allostasis refers capacity maintain stability physiological system face adversity . When expose chronic stressor , care CSHCN , individual expend great deal energy attempt maintain allostasis ; lead metabolic wear tear describe allostatic load . Evidence accumulate wear tear mediate change basal stress system activity effect change dependent system . Allostatic load resilience therefore assess measure basal stress system activity ( HPA axis salivary alpha-amylase ) . Thus , research reduce parent ' exposure stress , moreover , improve parental response stress , may improve well-being parent child . Yet , treatment focus psychosocial need parent CSHCN develop . Thus , research warrant examine intervene upon parental stress . Through focus group interview expert clinician , leader organization , parent child special need , study aim identify psychosocial need parent child learn disability , specifically ) type concern parent find difficult stressful b ) area concern lack support resource , c ) area need education skill training . This study also aim gather feedback Benson-Henry Institute 's Relaxation Response Resiliency Program ( 3RP ) advance next objective develop resiliency intervention provide support parent child learn disability . This study aim evaluate virtual 3RP Parents SPLD wait-list control trial determine ) feasibility acceptability b ) effectiveness decrease stress stress reactivity .</detailed_description>
