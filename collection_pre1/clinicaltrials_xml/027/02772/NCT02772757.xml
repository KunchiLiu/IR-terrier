	<brief_summary>The overall aim study compare verification accuracy hearing-aid outcome traditional , fitting approach patient present visit coupler-based fitting approach patient present mail hearing aid . If coupler-based fitting protocol test study effective traditional fitting protocol , patient receive replacement hear aid may circumvent face-to-face visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study incorporate verification technique simulate patient 's actual ear probe microphone verification measurement , call real-ear coupler difference ( RECD ) . Because patient 's ear use RECD measurement , rather simulate , patient would need present RECD verification . This RECD hearing aid verification occur clinic hearing aid mail patient . This study compare fit accuracy outcomes two approach .</detailed_description>
