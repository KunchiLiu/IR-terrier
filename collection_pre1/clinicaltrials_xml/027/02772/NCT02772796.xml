	<brief_summary>This study aid development use SENS-218 outside market therapeutic indication . SENS-218 available Asia market anti-emetic ( Anti-sickness ) drug often prescribed exposure chemotherapy . Chemotherapy exposure often induce nausea and/or vomit . The study involve one drug , refer SENS-218 study . The purpose study support development use SENS-218 non-Asian population . The key objective study identify pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter drug healthy Caucasian population . The PK refers body body , example , quickly drug absorb blood stream . The population eligible take part study healthy male female , non-smoking volunteer , age 18 50 year , determine screen test Simbec . Participation trial last 3 week ( first screen visit final end study visit ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist screen visit , 1 treatment period post study visit . These outline : Screening visit ( Day -14 Day -1 ) - Ensure subject eligible study . Treatment period 1 -If screen assessment satisfactory , subject invite attend Simbec take part study . The treatment period consist 2 overnight stay ( Day -1 morning Day 2 ) . One return visit require 48 hour point post dose Day 3 . Post study visit -Subjects ask attend Simbec 5-7 day administration last dose post study visit .
