	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) relate complication increase health burden world . Insulin deficiency insulin resistance patient diabetes trigger hyperglycemia main responsible micro macrovascular complication .

For reason , objective study evaluate effect benfotiamine AGEs soluble receptor ( sRAGE ) patient type 2 diabetes . The specific objective current study : 1 . To evaluate compare clinical anthropometric characteristic type 2 DM patient without benfotiamine treatment . 2 . To evaluate compare type 2 DM patient without benfotiamine treatment follow biochemical parameter : Carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) ( marker AGEs level ) , sRAGE , glucose , hemoglobin A1c , lipid ( total cholesterol , C-HDL , C-LDL , triglyceride ) . 3 . To evaluate compare dietary data dietary AGEs macro macronutrients type 2 DM patient without benfotiamine treatment . Type study : This randomize , control , double-blind clinical trial Methods 34 patient recruit , 17 per group , level significance 0.05 power 80 % . Size calculate difference group mean divide standard deviation . After sign inform consent subject assess inclusion criterion . Subjects meet inclusion criterion accept participate randomly assign receive either placebo benfotiamine treatment 12 week . The randomization do statistical Software ( SPSS , V. 21 , Chicago ) . After group assignment , subject instruct assist Research Center three time initial assessment . During first visit subject answer questionnaire personal data , medical history current medication . Patients ask 10-12 hour fast blood sample body composition assessment , weight , height waist circumference measure . Also blood pressure measure first visit . For dietary assessment 24-hour dietary recall apply 3 different day . Subjects instructed change dietary habit maintain exercise level length study . Subject visit Research Center every two-weeks receive new bottle pill answer adherence questionnaire also ask possible adverse event . At week six addition adherence questionnaire another blood sample blood pressure take . In addition , another 24-hour dietary recall complete At end 12 week basal assessment repeat . Main study parameters/ endpoint Change basal serum level follow parameter : measure basal end study : Carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , sRAGE Serum sample store frozen -80°C assessment . - Identification quantification CML measure immunoassay commercial kit ( OxiSelect ™ ) - Identification quantification sRAGE measure Human RAGE Immunoassay commercial kit ( Quantikine® ) Statistical analysis Data present mean standard deviation present normal distribution . Normality data evaluate Kolmogorov-Smirnov . To determinate basal difference group t-Student test independent sample apply . For difference group treatment t-Student test dependent sample apply . If data normal distribution , parametrical test use .</detailed_description>
