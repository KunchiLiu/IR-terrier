	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ability newly design device , Optic Nerve Glass ( O-Glass ) detect relative afferent pupillary defect ( RAPD ) . In prospective study , 44 patient ( diagnosed RAPD- positive ) enrol study . They examine RAPD O-Glass also manual swing flashlight method ( SFM ) . This newly design instrument capture record eye picture . The image process analyzed use computerized software calculate pupillary measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pupil response light stimulation basic clinical approach assessment patient visual loss . Asymmetric response may indicate relative afferent pupillary defect ( RAPD ) . The rapid detection device relative afferent pupillary defect ( present device ) newly design portable facility computerize software mobile device . This allow field ophthalmic examination identification RAPDs quickly accurately also record pupillary movement process analysis send information image via Wi-Fi . We aim compare evaluate device available method develop test practically easy quick objective result need specialist interpretation , technician perform test automatically . Distinctive software allow simple use device field personnel minimal training . Each patient investigate swing flashlight method newly construct automate O-glass . The swing flashlight test procedure , also call Marcus Gunn Test , well know ophthalmology science.The hardware device include 4 different part : Camera optic , light control system , power control system , microcontroller.The two main component software ability communicate hardware wirelessly , pattern recognition system .</detailed_description>
