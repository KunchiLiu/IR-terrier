	<brief_summary>Purposes : The purpose phase-II clinical trial determine whether ADCTA-G , biologic `` vaccine '' preparation patient 's dendritic cell ( DC ) glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) treatment , safe effective extend GBM patient 's life . The current conventional multi-modal regimen may include surgery tumor resection biopsy , temozolomide ( TMZ ) combine chemo-radiotherapy ( CCRT ) TMZ adjuvant chemotherapy almost always leave residual GBM cell cause fatal recurrence , lead medium survival period 8 -15 month over-all survival rate 30 % 2 year &lt; 3 % 5 year diagnosis/surgery . Thus , neurosurgical oncology practice , GBM patient first 2-year period receive multi-modal therapy watch closely possible GBM tumor recurrence mortal disease relapse immediately give palliative treatment health care , death . In phase-II trial , GBM patient participant receive ADCTA-G `` vaccine '' adjuvant immunotherapy ( added conventional multi-modal regimen ) similarly watch closely treatments health care visit least biweekly date surgery/diagnosis 24 month , alive follow weekly phone call schedule health care visit least every 3 month , 72 month surgery . In trial protocol , ADCT-G 10 dos administer surgery , period 6 8 month , adjuvant immunotherapy conventional multimodal regimen . Individual ADCTA-G `` vaccine '' lot every participant GBM patient manufacture patient 's monocyte-derived dendritic cell patient 's tumor cell antigen , prepare distinct method procedure perform within air particle-free barrier good laboratory practice ( GLP ) facility . Previous phase I/II clinical trial ADCTA-G `` vaccine '' immunotherapy administer adjuvant conventional multimodal regimen , obtain promising safety efficacy result GBM patient clinical center . This phase-II clinical trial China Medical University Hospital-Taichung employ essentially clinical protocol distinct `` vaccine '' manufacture method standard operational procedure ( SOP ) , , conventional multimodal regimen plus adjuvant immunotherapy use personal ADCTA-G `` vaccine '' lot every GBM patient participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell-Based Tumor Vaccine Adjuvant Immunotherapy Human Glioblastoma Multiforme ( WHO Grade IV Gliomas )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Background : Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) WHO grade IV malignant glioma brain among lethal human cancer . Despite current intensive multimodal regimen include use temozolomide ( TMZ ) combine chemo-radiotherapy ( CCRT ) subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy , medium survival period GBM patient still 8-16 month diagnosis surgery , prognosis vary accord demographic feature age , radiotherapy type chemotherapy measures.These fatal brain cancer general contain cancer cell mutation certain gene . Also , mutate GBM cancer cell usually heterogenous ; different GBM patient may individual set heterogenous glioma cancer cell mutant gene would generate altered antigen recognize patient 's adaptive immune system mount immuno-targeting response reject kill GBM tumor cell . However , GBM still fatal highly immunosuppressive , i.e . able anergize immune effector cell body . Although surgical resection rapidly expand tumor bulk prevent physical damage brain curtail immunosuppression , already anergized effector T lymphocytes still require functional restoration . On hand , post-surgical TMZ CCRT adjuvant chemotherapy may weaken residual tumor cell , TMZ also impair kill active T lymphocytes general , include anti-GBM lymphocyte . It therefore important exploit adaptive immunity system effective therapy GBM . To apply adaptive immunotherapy , best use patient 's surgical tumor specimen prepare individual `` tumor regression antigen '' load onto patient 's dendritic cell ( `` professional '' antigen process present cell immune system ) . Dendritic cell load tumor-specific antigen , upon maturation inoculation ( `` vaccination '' ) , would migrate/home T cell area lymph node stimulate proliferation tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte would move lymph node find brain tumor lesion attack eradicate residual GBM tumor cell , result prevention GBM recurrence . With fore-mentioned work hypothesis , investigator carry translational research 1997 2002 . A special method develop production immunotherapeutic , name `` autologous dendritic cell/autologous tumor cell antigens GBM '' ( ADCTA-G ) . For clinical trial purpose , investigator establish standard operational procedure ( SOP ) method use clinical Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP ) -grade cytokine pharmaceutical reagent . Individual ADCTA-G lot participant GBM patient manufacture high efficiency particle arrest ( HEPA ) air-filtered , germ-free bio-safety barrier clinical Good Laboratory Practice ( cGLP ) facility . The phase I/II clinical trial officially approve Taiwan Department Health perform clinical center demonstrate ADCTA-G adjuvant immunotherapy safe apparently could prolong survival GBM patient .</detailed_description>
