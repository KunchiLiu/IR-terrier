	<brief_summary>There many form small bowel disease direct consequence small bowel function often hard , impossible , establish . It would helpful reliable blood test find well cell intestine work . The amino acid citrulline produce mainly cell , therefore hold promise biological marker . Some previous study show fasting citrulline give good indication many intestinal cell present . However , author able confirm . Most citrulline blood derive another amino acid , glutamine , metabolic process occur intestinal cell , remainder come another amino acid , arginine . A potential marker intestinal cell function amino acid 3-methylhistidine . It possible dynamic test , incorporate time conversion one amino acid another intestinal cell , might perform good . The investigator therefore propose study oral glutamine , arginine , 3-methylhistidine compare citrulline placebo ( glucose ) hypothesize might increase amount citrulline reproducibly . An initial study healthy subject require establish whether true , provide normal range prior investigation patient might short bowel syndrome , test would clinically useful . In study , subject take amino acid placebo random order . Between 6 hour-long visit subject least one week independent research team behave normally . During visit subject sequence blood sample in-dwelling venous cannula , take 6 hour single small oral dose day 's amino acid give small volume drink . Urine also collect amino acid assay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Design The purpose study determine value measure citrulline oral challenge , aim examine function enterocyte mass patient short bowel syndrome . The investigator hope accumulate sufficient preliminary data order develop new biochemical test assess absorption future patient group . All subject provide write informed consent prior inclusion study . The study perform accordance International Conference Harmonisation Guidelines Good Clinical Practice ( ICH GCP ) , Helsinki Declaration national regulation . Information study provide one-on-one interview help summary brochure give potential subject . The study consider UK Medicines Agency , Medicines Healthcare product Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , agree clinical trial investigational medicinal product . Recruitment 1 . Potential participant identify investigator 's team . The source include hospital investigator database . 2 . If permit , advertisement post study University College London ( UCL ) electronic news site , disseminate via UCL staff student email , flier post physical notice board UCL . Direct invitation researcher may also attempt . 3 . Healthy volunteer offer Â£7.85/hour participation study . Consent Written inform consent obtain study-specific procedure carry . All participant free withdraw study time . Risk , burden benefit Apart small risk associate venous access study expect without important hazard . The agent administer essentially constituent normal diet . There expectation participant benefit study .
