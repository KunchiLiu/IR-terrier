	<detailed_description>Tolcapone increase effect dopamine brain . Dopamine substance normally present brain . It may increase body movement may also change person 's ability process information . Tolcapone stops naturally-released dopamine broken quickly . We interest learn tolcapone positive effect person 's decision reward .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This behavioral fMRI study recruit alcohol drinker also participate gamble activity . Subjects select unbiased fashion respect gender ethnicity , minority representation issue interact hypothesis . To eligible participate study , follow inclusion criterion must also meet : 1 . Subject healthy volunteer 1850 year age . 2 . Subject right hand ( important interpret MRI activity ) . 3 . If female , subject nonlactating , pregnant use reliable contraception method ( i.e . abstinence , intrauterine device , hormonal birth control barrier method ) . 4 . Subject able read speak English . 5 . Subject high school graduate . 6 . Subject able willing provide write informed consent . 7 . Subject able understand follow instruction investigator , understand rating scale . 8 . Subject good health . â€¢ In order ass potential contraindication tolcapone , blood test routine chemistry include white cell count , red cell count , platelet count , hemoglobin , hematocrit , MCV , MCH , MCHC , RDW , neutrophils , lymphocyte , monocyte , eosinophil , basophil . Additionally , hepatic screen assay total protein , albumin , globulin , A/G ratio , bilirubin ( total , direct , indirect ) , alkaline phosphatase , AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) . Elevation plasma bilirubin , AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase consistent liver disease ground subject exclusion . ( Note ongoing monitoring liver enzymes necessary , single , counterbalance dose tolcapone administer subject . ) Subjects additionally urinescreened illicit drug use screen alcohol intoxication via breathalyzer . The 7 drug class detect include cocaine , amphetamine , methamphetamine , benzodiazepine , THC , opiates &amp; oxycodone . These drug choose due possible interaction tolcapone possible cognitive cardiovascular effect . No identifier put test cup read immediately discard researcher . Similarly , result breathalyzer read test discard . No personal identifier associate test result . Subjects test positive substance , exception THC , exclude participation study . Subjects use psychoactive drug ( except marijuana ) within 2 week start study 10 time last year exclude participation study . Subjects also exclude regularly use medication affect dopamine level , use medication within two week tolcapone administration ( tolcapone , entacapone , follow : levodopa/carbidopa , amantadine , bromocriptine , pergolide , pramipexole , ropinirole , selegeline , isocarboxazid , phenelzine , tranylcypromine , clozapine , olanzapine , quetiapine , risperidone , ziprasidone , aripiprazole , fluphenazine , haloperidol , perphenazine , pimozide , thiothixene , trifluoperazine , loxapine , molindone , chlorpromazine , mesoridazine , thioridazine , dextroamphetamine , dexmethylphenidate , dextroamphetamine , methylphenidate ) . A licensed health care provider also conduct brief physical exam . This exam search sign medical illness , include jaundice abdominal distension associate liver disease , would exclude subject participate study . Subjects clinically significant medical psychiatric illness require treatment determine screen blood test , medical history , and/or physical exam eligible participate study . Female subject also screen pregnancy , effect COMT inhibitor pregnancy adequately know compound appear breast milk . ( Pregnancy also contraindication MRI scanning ) . Since subject may know pregnant , female subject recruit participate study require urine pregnancy test prior session study . These requirement apply female subject postmenopausal . Active use substance alcohol , tobacco , marijuana , use alcohol day meeting assess breathalyzer testing , report marijuana use 48 hour precede test visit , and/or positive pregnancy test , ground exclusion . For subject participate fMRI , administer extensive questionnaire listing contraindication MRI scanning . Because MRI scanner attract certain metal , subject may metallic object body exclude . As additional measure protection , use handheld metal detector screen subject enter scanner . Subjects experience claustrophobia also exclude participate MRI scan . Known allergy intolerance tolcapone use investigational drug within 30 day screen visit ground exclusion .</criteria>
