	<brief_summary>This two-stage experiment ; first stage open label trial participant receive six intravenous ( IV ) treatment ketamine . The second stage include participant respond ketamine ( i.e . reduction 25 % symptoms depression , measure Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale MADRS ) . The second stage double-blind , control clinical trial D-cycloserine ( DCS ) vs. placebo , maintenance treatment patient respond ketamine treatment . The aim study determine whether 8 week DCS maintenance therapy prevent relapse depressive symptom follow ketamine infusion</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background MDD one lead cause disability worldwide [ 5 ] . A substantial proportion patient achieve adequate remission despite multiple antidepressant trial augmentation strategy . TRD define insufficient response least two adequate antidepressant trial . Many patient refer somatic treatment ; e.g . electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) , repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Vagal Nerve Stimulation ( VNS ) , cause side effect , always efficacious . Ketamine safely use decade induction maintenance anesthesia recently chronic pain . Ketamine noncompetitive , high-affinity antagonist NMDA type glutamate receptor , additional effect dopamine μ-opioid receptor . During last decade , 4 meta analysis summarize 22 controlled trial publish , show rapid impressive effect ketamine TRD patient [ 6-8 ] . These trial show single slow IV ketamine sub-anesthetic dose ( 0.5 mg/kg ) 40 minute dramatically improve depressive symptom . Across study , clinically significant antidepressant response maintain 72 hour approximately half patient ; minority relapse within first two week post-ketamine infusion [ 9 , 10 ] . aan het Rot et al . [ 11 ] show repeat IV ketamine infusion prolong duration improvement . D-cycloserine ( seromycin ) broad spectrum antibiotic , use thirty year treatment tuberculosis , DCS function partial agonist NMDA-R glycine site , agonist effect predominate low dose antagonist effect high dose . Low DCS dosage , 50-500 mg/d implement anxiety patient memory learn enhancement . Beneficial antidepressant effect report high dosage ( 500-1000 mg/day ) use [ 3 ] . DCS regimens TRD patient suggest high dose DCS may indeed beneficial treatment MDD . However , previous study use low dosage ( 250mg/d ) show significant difference placebo [ 3 ] . The antidepressant effect DCS seem derive ability inhibit NMDA-R function , similarly ketamine . One recent study demonstrate beneficial effect DCS ketamine infusion bipolar depression patient [ 12 ] . Due potential neurotoxicity ketamine prolong administration . Other NMDA antagonist follow ketamine infusion [ 13 ] . Therefore reason DCS post-ketamine administration considerably reduce relapse TRD patient compare placebo . Study Design 1 . Patients undergo 6 ketamine infusion within 3-week period . Intravenous ketamine administrate senior anesthesiologist supervision senior psychiatrist hence ensure patient safety . We believe sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion safer cause few side effect ECT . The procedure explain detail patient , write consent obtain . After psychiatric medical evaluation senior psychiatrist senior anesthesiologist , patient give ketamine infusion add antidepressant therapy . A slow ketamine infusion 0.5mg/kg 40 minute give patient . Patients monitor experienced staff include senior anesthesiologist nurse well psychiatrist available nearby . All patient monitor continuously heart rate rhythm oxygen saturation , blood pressure measure 10 minute interval . Heart rate variability measure analyzed ketamine treatment . Measurements perform ketamine infusion baseline , 3 6 treatment . Depressive symptom measure use Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale ( MADRS ) . In addition Clinical Global Severity Scale ( CGI-S ) Clinical Global Improvement ( CGI-I ) perform 2 hour treatment . In many case , patient depression also suffer alexithymia : inappropriate identification emotion . Alexithymia measure baseline 3 6 treatment . Ketamine infusion stop case 20 % increase blood pressure heart rate baseline value and/ acute dissociative state . Patients discharge home least three hour end infusion . Due potential effect ketamine patient need escort hospital family member friend . 2 . For patient meet response criterion ( MADRS≥25 % ) 6 ketamine infusion , ketamine administration ( week 1-3 : day 1-21 ) stop patient start receive DCS placebo titrate slowly 1000mg/d next 8 week [ 2 ] follow manner : 1 . Week 4 : Days 22-24 - 250mg/d , one pill per day Well-being assessment adverse effect evaluation drug elevation . 2 . Mid-week 4 end week 6 : Days 25-42 - 500mg/d , two pill per day 3 . Week 7 : Day 43-49 - 750mg/d , three pill per day 4 . Weeks 8-11 : Days 50-77 - 1000mg/d four pill per day 3 . Pyridoxine 200-300mg/d prescribed patient begin study . 4 . Patients improve 6 ketamine treatment remove study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 1875 meeting DSMV criterion moderatesevere depression ( MADRS≥25 ) , respond two adequate antidepressant course treatment . Subjects require continue stable dose psychotropic medication taking , 8 week prior ketamine infusion . Participants respond ketamine ( reduction 25 % symptom ) would invite participate second stage experiment , participant would consume DCS 8 week ( week 411 ) . Patients exclude current history psychotic dissociative symptom , severe personality disorder psychosis dissociative symptom . Additional exclusion criterion lifetime history psychotic mania , substance abuse use alcohol . Medical exclusion criterion include uncontrolled elevate blood pressure , nonsinus rhythm , unstable ischemic heart disease , uncorrected hyper thyroidism , woman , pregnancy initiation female hormonal treatment &lt; 3 month . Before ketamine treatment woman childbearing age require use medical accept contraceptive abstain sexual activity . In addition patient exclude suffer chronic renal failure , epilepsy , organic brain disorder neurological unstable medical condition . Due neurotoxicity convulsion , patient prohibit consume alcohol .</criteria>
