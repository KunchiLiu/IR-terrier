	<brief_summary>This study compare administration porcine surfactant ( poractant alfa , Curosurf® ) less invasive method ( LISA ) use thin catheter ( CHF 6440 ) non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) ( CPAP , NIPPV , BiPAP ) approve conventional surfactant administration invasive ventilation rapid extubation term short term mid-term safety efficacy spontaneously breathe preterm neonate clinical sign respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Preterm Neonates With RDS Compare CUROSURF® Administration Through LISA Conventional Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label , multinational , multicenter , randomize , control study . Neonates evaluate accord selection criterion randomize surfactant treatment via LISA standard administration procedure ( Table 1 ) . The enrolment stagger : gestational age restrict 27+0 week 28+6 complete week first 30 neonate . Provided safety concern raise , enrolment enlarge whole population ( i.e . 25+0 week 28+6 complete week ) . Enrolled neonate evaluate main phase trial 36 wks PMA . Their development finally assess 24-month corrected age separate stand-alone visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent obtain parents/legal representative ( accord local regulation ) prior birth 2 . Inborn preterm neonates either sex age ≥30 minute &lt; 24 hour , spontaneously breathe stabilize NIV . 3 . Gestational age 25+0 week 28+6 complete week , except first 30 enrol neonate gestational age restrict 27+0 week 28+6 week . 4 . Clinical course consistent RDS . 5 . Fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) ≥0.30 maintain SpO2 8895 % . 1 . Need immediate endotracheal intubation cardiopulmonary resuscitation insufficient respiratory drive 2 . Use nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation ( nHFOV ) prior study entry 3 . Use surfactant prior study entry need intratracheal administration treatment ( e.g . nitric oxide ) 4 . Known genetic chromosomal disorder , major congenital anomaly ( congenital heart disease , myelomeningocele etc ) 5 . Mothers prolong rupture membrane ( &gt; 21 day duration ) 6 . Presence air leak identify know prior study entry 7 . Evidence severe birth asphyxia ( e.g . Apgar score ≤ 5 10 minute birth , continue need resuscitation 10 minute birth , alter neurological state ) 8 . Neonatal seizure prior study entry 9 . Any condition , opinion Investigator , would place neonate undue risk 10 . Participation another clinical trial placebo , drug biological substance conduct provision protocol</criteria>
