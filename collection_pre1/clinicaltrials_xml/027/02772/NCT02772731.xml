	<brief_summary>Breast cancer common malignancy affect woman US . Surgical management mainstay therapy , general consist resection primary tumor either partial mastectomy ( aka `` lumpectomy '' ) total mastectomy . The investigator hypothesize routine shave margin partial mastectomy significantly reduce positive margin rate . A positive margin mean cancerous cell detect edge excise area . This generally mandate return operate room re-excision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shave Margins vs. Standard Partial Mastectomy Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some author investigate , retrospective fashion , use routine shave margin , surgeon routinely take additional margin time initial partial mastectomy mean obtain negative margin . While retrospective study find positive margin rate decline use technique , opponent technique wonder truly result higher negative margin rate without compromise cosmesis increase tissue volume remove . As study retrospective , possible initial resection small routinely take shave margin would resect . No one evaluate impact resection operative time , blind fashion , evaluate cosmesis . Further , yet prospective study evaluate impact local recurrence rate . Hence , investigator perform prospective randomize controlled trial technique Yale . The data study , publish New England Journal Medicine , find technique cut positive margin re-excision rate half . Some wonder , however , external generalizability finding , particularly non-academic setting . Hence , multicenter trial validate finding warrant .</detailed_description>
