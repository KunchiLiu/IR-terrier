	<brief_title>Comparison SUV Using SPECT/CT Between Grave 's Disease Patients Normal Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally consider positron emission tomography ( PET ) ability obtain standardized uptake value（SUV）while single-photo emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) . Recently develop technology , ability SPECT extend . On hand , thyroid imaging SPECT play auxiliary role hyperthyroidism diagnosis mainly since regard nonquantitative . So investigator design study search capacity accuracy SUV provide SPECT CT ( CT use reconstruction algorithm ) diagnose GD . This multiple-center study contain nine group China use GE Discovery NM/CT , advance equipment . Thus , data accurate available . And perspective clinical trial , take eight month . The investigator plan evaluate least 50 Grave 's Disease ( GD ) patient 50 normal human contrast . Every GD patient must diagnose result thyroid function test ( TSH , FT3 , FT4） must available . If necessary , patient 's rate iodine uptake also know he/she include study . As normal people , result thyroid function test within range normal value . The data participant gather store . And data process do help GE staff , use software Q.Metrix get value SUVmean , SUVmax . Finally T test use comparison difference .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Group GD Patients : certainly diagnose GD treatment sign inform consent Inflammatory Hyperthyroidism Secondary Hyperthyroidism ( since medicine , thyrotrophs neoplasm etc ) Can finish check SPECT/CT Refuse sign inform consent For Group Normal Humans : without GD Adult sign reform consent Without normal value TSH , FT3 , FT4 Can finish check SPECT/CT Failed sign reform consent</criteria>
