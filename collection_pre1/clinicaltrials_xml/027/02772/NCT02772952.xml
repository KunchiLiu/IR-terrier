	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare short-term medium-term effectiveness multimodal program integrate program therapeutic exercise , medication review , adequacy diet health education , compare standard medical practice improve neuromuscular physiological status frail elderly . Another aim analyze maintenance effect monitor long-term ( 12 month ) start intervention . Design : Randomized controlled trial Scope / Study subject : recruit frail elderly Basic Health Zone Malaga . Methods : The subject include study ( meet inclusion / exclusion ) randomize two group : control group whose intervention review medication + adequacy diet + health education ( physical activity recommendation ( within comprehensive advice healthy lifestyle ) experimental group whose intervention Multimodal Intervention : therapeutic exercise + review medication + adequacy diet + health education program . Sociodemographic , Clinical monitoring Variables collect baseline . Moreover , track variable collect 2 6 month start intervention 3 6 month end intervention ( monitor ) . The monitoring variable measure : BMI , general health , fatigue , brittleness , Motor Control , Attention - Concentration - Memory , Motor Memory , spatial orientation , grip strength , balance ( static - semi-static dynamic ) , gait speed metabolomic variable . One descriptive analysis sociodemographic variable participant perform . Further change variable intra-subjects ( pre-post intervention ) inter-subjects ( experimental group vs control group ) calculate . For intra-subject analysis perform ANOVA-one factor analysis . The intersubject outcome variable compare two group moment data collection , use student t-test Wilconxon ( depend sample distribution ) . The level significance set P â‰¤ 0.05 .</brief_summary>
