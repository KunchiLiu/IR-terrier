	<brief_summary>This phase IIa study ass safety , tolerability , plasma pharmacokinetics efficacy intermittent oral administration standard levodopa/carbidopa ( LD/CD ) vs.semi-continuous intra-oral administration levodopa/carbidopa patient advance Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) suffer motor fluctuations.The objective study ass plasma pharmacokinetics ( PK ) continuous intra-oral administration LD/CD vs. intermittent administration standard oral LD/CD . For purpose study continuous intra-oral administration LD/CD define oral administration LD/CD 5-10 minute interval . Secondary objective assess safety tolerability continuous intra-oral administration LD/CD effect PD motor function continuous intra-oral administration LD/CD vs. intermittent administration standard oral LD/CD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Oral Administration vs. Semi-continuous Intra-oral Administration Levodopa/Carbidopa Fluctuating Parkinsonian Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18 PD subject motor fluctuation stable dos standard levodopa/carbidopa +/- dopaminergic therapy meet entry criterion sign Institutional Ethical Committee approve informed consent participate study . The study conduct San Raffaele IRCCS Rome , Italy . Subjects successfully complete screen activity confirm eligibility approve enrollment steer committee admit hospital even day 1 undergo baseline evaluation . Standard oral levodopa/carbidopa ( LD/CD ) medication stop midnight . On day 2 , standardize low protein breakfast provide treatment initiated usual dose standard oral LD/CD . All subsequent dos administer pre-baseline dosing interval ; anti-parkinson medication stop maintain usual dose . If rescue therapy require , treatment apomorphine sc administer first preference . Plasma level levodopa metabolite measure course ensue 8 hour . Physicians assess motor status ( , without dyskinesia , dyskinesia ) 30-minute interval throughout 8-hour observation period perform UPDRS motor exams 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 hour . Patients resume standard oral LD/CD anti-parkinsonian medication ( ) , stop midnight . On day 3 subject receive continuous intra-oral administration standard LD/CD dose equal total dose standard oral LD/CD would normally consume time course study period . For purpose study continuous intra-oral administration refer oral dose 5-10 minute interval . To achieve , drug chop administered water total dose levodopa would normally take intermittently divide administer small dos 5-10 minute interval . Patients undergo PK blood sample Day 2 . If patient take Stalevo , dose entacapone administer usual time interval Stalevo otherwise would take . Patients resume standard oral LD/CD anti-parkinsonian medication ( ) , stop midnight . On Day 4 study subject receive first LD/CD dose orally , balance total dose would normally take next 8 hour way continuous intra-oral administration LD/CD course 8 hour study period . If take Stalevo , entacapone administer time Stalevo would normally take . Physicians assess motor status ( , without dyskinesia , dyskinesia ) 30-minute interval throughout continuous intra-oral administration perform UPDRS motor exams 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 hour . At completion study , patient discharge clinic standard medication . Patients return day 18 safety evaluation .</detailed_description>
