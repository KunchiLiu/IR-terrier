	<detailed_description>Materials Methods Study Setting : Pediatric Intensive Care Unit , Advanced Pediatric Centre , Postgraduate Institute Medical Educational Research Study Period : Jan 2016 Dec 2016 Study design : Prospective Cohort Study Study Population : Children 2 year 12 year age Study flow All consecutive patient age group 2 year 12 year admit Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Advanced pediatric Centre PRISM score 20 screened inclusion study.Those find eligible would include informed consent . Baseline clinical demographic profile record proforma . Entry Examination Clinical Evaluation It would include history examination . A clinical evaluation perform time patient recruitment daily till discharge ICU . It would also include assessment Glasgow Coma Scale , Sequential Organ System Failure score ( SOFA ) tendon reflex . The muscle strength main muscle group grade use Medical Research Council ( MRC ) scale cooperative child . - Upper Extremity : Wrist Extension , Elbow Flexion , Shoulder Abduction - Lower Extremity : Ankle Dorsiflexion , Knee Extension , Hip Flexion Scoring &amp; Interpretation : - Maximum Score : 60 ( 4 Limbs , Maximum 15 Points Per Limb ) = Normal - Minimum Score : 0 = Quadriplegia Severity multi organ failure assess mean SOFA score ICU stay , high SOFA score sum 28-day total SOFA score every patient . The total dose duration drug therapy like steroid , muscle relaxant , sedative inotropes also enter . Laboratory parameter like serum creatine kinase , albumin , total protein , serum electrolyte plasma blood glucose also quantify . Electrophysiological Evaluation Twenty fours admission , entry examination form complete nerve conduction study 4 motor nerve ( median , ulnar , tibial common peroneal nerve ) 2 sensory nerve ( median sural nerve ) perform . These consist Compound Motor Action Potential ( CMAP ) measurement motor nerve Sensory Nerve Action Potential ( SNAP ) assessment sensory nerve . Before electrophysiological test , heat pack apply skin temperature 33Â°C . Serial Examination Following detailed entry evaluation , daily simplify electrophysiological test form conduction velocity amplitude sural SNAP common peroneal CMAP one leg use surface electrode stimulation record electrode assess . To minimize artifact , electrode site mark similar size electrode use patient daily basis . A 25 % decrease baseline SNAP CMAP measure ICU admission take minimum consistently detectable reduction.If SNAP CMAP decrease 25 % two consecutive day , complete electrophysiological test perform . Complete electrophysiological test include nerve conduction study electromyography.Electromyography record use coaxial needle electrode tibialis anterior first dorsal interossei.If complete electrophysiological test consistent critical illness weakness , complete weekly test replace daily test ICU discharge .</detailed_description>
