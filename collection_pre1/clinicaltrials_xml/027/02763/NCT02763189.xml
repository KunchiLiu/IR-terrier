	<brief_title>Effect Mentoring Endotracheal Tube Exchange Using New Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After inform consent obtain , two group randomized anesthesiologist receive detailed instructional material include brochure introduce new device , videotape show device use , detailed slide show explain step , checklist step perform exchange ( E ) simulation . The Mentored group ( M ) also receive expert instruction procedure , Control group ( C ) amount time review step . Next , perform first exchange procedure ( E1 ) pair expert observe measure simulate patient ' apnea time . The expert conduct debrief M group , C group debrief group perform exchange second time ( E2 ) . Both group receive debrief expert . The apnea time performance assessment compare M C determine effect expert training , also compare within group E1 E2 , determine effect experience apnea time performance . Finally , survey conduct E1 E2 , debriefing , determine participant ' satisfaction new device . Data apnea time use statistical power analysis determine size large group necessary show significant difference outcomes .</detailed_description>
