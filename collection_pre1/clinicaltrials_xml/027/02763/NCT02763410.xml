	<brief_summary>Safety transfusion major issue medical economics . Despite drastic quality control measure , transfusion still source short , mid long-term morbi-mortality . This explain extent change composition pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) supernatant storage essentially appearance immunologically active compound possibly involve organ dysfunction one hand post-transfusion immunomodulation hand . These phenomena impact upon outcome cardiac surgery patient . In term organ dysfunction , kidney failure due acute tubular necrosis pulmonary failure 2 main issue . Following cardiac surgery , 11 % patient present transient renal dysfunction characterise 25 % increase serum creatinine level 3.5 % require dialysis . The intensity acute renal failure ( ARF ) correlate resuscitation : 20 % increase serum creatinine level 2 3 day surgery significantly raise morbidity rate 50 % increase raise mortality rate 10 % . The precise mechanism govern post-transfusion immunomodulation yet define . The appearance soluble type I Human leukocytes Antigen ( HLA ) molecule ( sHLA-I ) , FAS ligand ( FAS-L ) cluster designation 40 ( CD40-L ) supernatant PRBCs along storage blood product may involve phenomenon . These molecule capable activate trigger death innate adaptive immunity cell , especially Natural Killer ( NK ) cell . Consequently investigator propose focus specifically detailed composition transfuse PRBC supernatant order identify candidate molecule responsible organ dysfunction post-transfusion immunoparalysis . The investigator combine clinical approach base transcriptional analysis renal tubular cell transfuse patient ex-vivo approach investigate effect supernatant immune cell Natural Killer cell healthy volunteer</brief_summary>
