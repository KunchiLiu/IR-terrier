	<brief_summary>Background : Asthma obesity public health crisis concurrently rise past decade , affect million child United States disproportionately affect low-income minority child urban area . The child high risk asthma obesity also great exposure indoor outdoor pollution . Emerging evidence suggest obesity may confer increased susceptibility health effect air pollution . Methods : Aiming provide causal-level evidence observational finding , propose home intervention study 1 ) test whether target reduction indoor Particulate Matter ( PM ) concentration improve respiratory health overweight inner-city child asthma lean inner-city child asthma 2 ) investigate mediator susceptibility indoor PM among overweight versus lean child asthma . We accomplish aim use 1:1 randomize control trial 200 child persistent asthma ( half normal weight , half overweight ) living Baltimore City . Participants randomize receive either two active air purifier contain high-efficiency particulate air ( HEPA ) filter two sham air purifier filter remove . Implications : If aforementioned observational finding confirm , implication directly relevant 170 million child around world estimate overweight obese .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary object study determine efficacy target environmental intervention among overweight inner city child compare normal weight inner city child asthma . Specific Aim # 1 : To determine overweight inner-city child , compare lean inner-city child , great improvement asthma air purifier intervention aim reduce indoor PM . Hypothesis 1 : An intervention use HEPA filter air purifier home inner-city child asthma associate great respiratory improvement overweight child normal weight child . Specific Aim # 2a : To investigate mediator susceptibility among overweight versus normal weight child asthma . Hypothesis # 2 . Candidate mediator , include increase ) tidal volume thereby increase dos inhaled particle , b ) inflammatory oxidative stress response , c ) corticosteroid resistance , ) sleep disorder breathing mediate increase susceptibility indoor PM among overweight versus normal weight child asthma . Children asthma enrol study 16 week . They three clinic visit , overnight sleep study , two home environmental assessment one week . They home clinical assessment randomization another home clinical assessment 12 week randomization . The primary outcome measure maximum number asthma symptom day .</detailed_description>
