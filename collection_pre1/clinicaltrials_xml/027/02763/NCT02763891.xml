	<brief_title>Effect Body Suspension Tilting Exercises Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Body suspension tilt exercise perform Chordata equipment might effective option improve trunk muscle activation facilitate functional balance mobility control Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . To evaluate hypothesis , subject randomize control group intervention group . Intervention group receive 30-minute session body suspension tilt exercise Chordata equipment ( PI : 0804871-1 BR 10 2012 009901-2 ) twice week eight week , control group receive passive muscle stretch maintain usual routine period . Both group assess baseline immediately intervention protocol . Finally , follow-up evaluation perform 8 week protocol end ( verify possible long-lasting effect exercise protocol ) .</detailed_description>
