	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluate Efficacy Safety MOR208 With Bendamustine ( BEN ) Versus Rituximab ( RTX ) With BEN Adult Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , two-arm , multicentre , open-label phase II/III efficacy safety study MOR208 combination BEN versus RTX combination BEN give adult patient relapse refractory least one three prior systemic therapy fail , candidate HDC ASCT , thus exhaust therapeutic option demonstrate clinical benefit . At least one prior therapy line must include CD20-targeted therapy .</detailed_description>

In opinion investigator , patient must : 1. able comply studyrelated procedure , medication use , evaluation 2. able understand give informed consent 3. consider potentially unreliable and/or cooperative . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients : histological type lymphoma include , e.g. , primary mediastinal ( thymic ) large Bcell lymphoma ( PMBL ) Burkitt 's lymphoma , primary refractory DLBCL , patient know `` double/triple hit '' DLBCL genetics , CNS lymphoma involvement present past medical history 2 .
