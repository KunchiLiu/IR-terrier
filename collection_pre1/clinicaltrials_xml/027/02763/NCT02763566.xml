	<criteria>Have diagnosis HR+ , HER2 breast cancer . Although require protocol procedure , metastatic disease consider biopsy whenever possible reassess hormone receptor ( HR ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status clinically indicate . To fulfill requirement HR+ disease , breast cancer must express , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , least 1 HRs ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] , progesterone receptor [ PgR ] ) define relevant American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) /College American Pathologists ( CAP ) guideline . To fulfill requirement HER2 disease , breast cancer must demonstrate , initial diagnosis upon subsequent biopsy , overexpression HER2 either IHC insitu hybridization define relevant ASCO/CAP guideline . Meet either Inclusion Criterion ( 2a ) Inclusion Criterion ( 2b ) . Participants meet Inclusion Criterion 2a enrol Cohort A participant meet Inclusion Criterion 2b enrol Cohort B . ( 2a ) Have locoregionally recurrent disease amenable resection radiation therapy curative intent metastatic disease . Relapsed radiologic evidence progression 1 year completion adjuvant endocrine therapy receive prior endocrine therapy locoregionally recurrent metastatic disease ( Note : prior adjuvant endocrine therapy localize disease may include , limit , antiestrogens aromatase inhibitor . In addition , participant may enrol receive ≤2 week NSAI disease set immediately precede screen agrees discontinue NSAI study treatment initiation . ) OR Presented de novo metastatic breast cancer ( mBC ) receive prior endocrine therapy . ( 2b ) Have locoregionally recurrent disease amenable resection radiation therapy curative intent metastatic disease . Relapsed radiologic evidence progression receive neoadjuvant adjuvant endocrine therapy , subsequent endocrine therapy receive following progression OR Relapsed radiologic evidence progression within 1 year completion adjuvant endocrine therapy , subsequent endocrine therapy receive following progression OR Relapsed radiologic evidence progression 1 year completion adjuvant endocrine therapy subsequently relapse radiologic evidence progression receive treatment either antiestrogen aromatase inhibitor firstline endocrine therapy metastatic disease . Participants may receive 1 line endocrine therapy prior chemotherapy metastatic disease OR Presented de novo metastatic disease relapse radiologic evidence progression receive treatment either antiestrogen aromatase inhibitor firstline endocrine therapy metastatic disease . Participants may receive 1 line endocrine therapy prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . Have postmenopausal status define meet least 1 following : Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age ≥60 year Age &lt; 60 year amenorrheic least 12 month ( absence chemotherapy , tamoxifen , toremifene , ovarian suppression ) folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) estradiol level postmenopausal range . Have 1 follow , define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 : Measurable disease Nonmeasurable boneonly disease . Nonmeasurable boneonly disease may include follow : blastic bone lesion , lytic bone lesion without measurable soft tissue component , mixed lyticblastic bone lesion without measurable soft tissue component . Have performance status ( PS ) ≤1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology ( ECOG ) scale . Have adequate organ function , include : Hematologic : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 × 109/Liter ( L ) , platelets ≥100 × 109/L , hemoglobin ≥8 g/deciliter ( dL ) . Participants may receive erythrocyte transfusion achieve hemoglobin level discretion investigator ; however , initial study drug treatment must begin early day erythrocyte transfusion . Hepatic : Total bilirubin ≤1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤3.0 time ULN ( ALT AST ≤5 time ULN liver metastasis present ) . Renal : serum creatinine ≤1.5 time ULN . Have discontinue previous localize radiotherapy palliative purpose lytic lesion risk fracture least 2 week prior randomization recover acute effect therapy ( toxicity resolve either baseline least Grade 1 ) except residual alopecia peripheral neuropathy . Are able swallow capsule . Are reliable , willing available duration study , willing follow study procedure . Have visceral crisis , lymphangitic spread , leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . Visceral crisis mere presence visceral metastasis , implies severe organ dysfunction assess symptom sign , laboratory study , rapid progression disease . Have inflammatory breast cancer . Have clinical evidence history central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis . Screening test require enrollment . Are currently receive previously receive chemotherapy locoregionally recurrent metastatic breast cancer . ( Note : Participants may enrol receive prior [ neo ] adjuvant chemotherapy localize disease . ) Have receive prior treatment everolimus fulvestrant ( Cohort B ) . Have receive prior treatment cyclindependent kinases 4 6 ( CDK4 CDK6 ) inhibitor ( participated CDK4 CDK6 inhibitor clinical trial treatment assignment still blind ) . Have initiate bisphosphonates approve Receptor activator nuclear factor kappaB ligand ( RANKL ) target agent &lt; 7 day prior randomization . Are currently enrol clinical trial involve investigational product ( IP ) nonapproved use drug device ( IP/device use study ) , concurrently enrol type medical research judge scientifically medically compatible study . If participant currently enrol clinical trial involve nonapproved use device , agreement investigator Eli Lilly Company ( Lilly ) clinical research physician ( CRP ) require establish eligibility . Have receive treatment drug receive regulatory approval indication within 14 21 day randomization nonmyelosuppressive myelosuppressive agent , respectively . Have major surgery within 14 day prior randomization allow postoperative heal surgical wound site ( ) . Have receive recent ( within 28 day prior randomization ) live attenuate vaccine yellow fever vaccine . Have serious preexist medical condition , judgment investigator , would preclude participation study ( eg , history major surgical resection involve stomach small bowel , preexist Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) . Have personal history within last 12 month follow condition : syncope cardiovascular etiology , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , sudden cardiac arrest . Have history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy minimum 3 year . Have receive autologous allogeneic stemcell transplant . Have clinical evidence active bacterial fungal infection active viral infection , judgment investigator , would preclude participation study ( eg , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] viral hepatitis ) . Screening test require enrollment .</criteria>
