	<detailed_description>Background Resting state EEG measure produce useful spectral index power different frequency band . One robust find attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) increase theta band power ( typically 4-7 Hz ) relative beta band power ( 13-30 Hz ) otherwise express 'theta beta ratio ' ( TBR ; Barry , Clark &amp; Johnstone , 2003 ) . TBR possibly reflect interaction subcortical prefrontal cortical area brain ( Schutter &amp; Knyazev , 2012 ) . A recent study Leiden University lab show increase TBR related less self-reported attentional control correlate strong decline attentional control stress-induction ( Putman et al. , 2014 ) core element cognitive performance anxiety ( CPA ) ; phenomenon define fear compromise individual 's capacity execute task . Given theta/beta ratio might serve marker PFC-mediated attentional control vulnerability effect CPA , eventual goal research program test whether theta/beta ratio reduction might effective reduce symptom CPA . Neurofeedback train method induce change EEG frequency power band . Online feedback people 's EEG spectrum ask increase decrease power certain frequency band eventually lead ability ( Vernon , 2005 ) . Application TBR Neurofeedback training aim reduce TBR might effective reduce attentional dysfunction ADHD patient ( Lofthouse et al. , 2012 ) might possibly increase resilience deleterious effect stress cognition ( Putman et al. , 2014 ) . The investigator would ultimately like study effect train individual elevate vulnerability CPA ; high average TBR . The primary goal current study see possible change EEG TBR signature population mean NFT protocol . Additionally , would like explore effect prefrontal mechanism regulate attention interfere distractors administer letter string interference task ( Bishop , 2009 ) fix moment train . Data pertain cognitive measure use inform design future study find mentioned publication explicitly exploratory ( ) provide evidence accept reject hypothesis effect NFT protocol cognitive performance . Our design different widely use randomize controlled trial design ( RCT ) . RCT design generally consider superior method estimate intervention true effect . However designs case study well-matched comparison group - study may provide information valuable clinical intervention study case intervention provide compelling evidence effect . The current study serve first try-out whether reduce TBR use Neurofeedback training RCT design might unnecessarily cost considerable lot time effort . We propose alternative RCT design , namely use small group participant start EEG rest state measurement baseline switch real Neurofeedback training different point time ; call 'case series multiple baseline design ' . Practical advantage multiple baseline design design require few participant participant act control . Visual inspection single-case statistic use determine effectiveness Neurofeedback training observe difference TBR per group time ( see section 'Statistical analysis plan ' ) . Aims , research question hypothesis The main aim study evaluate effect Neurofeedback train reduce EEG theta/beta ratio individual elevate baseline TBR . Furthermore , second degree importance , investigator test reduction TBR increase cognitive performance response conflict task . The research question ; TBR Neurofeedback training healthy ( non-ADHD ) people elevate TBR reduce TBR ( much secondary ) training perhaps increase cognitive performance response conflict task ? If might continue study ass NFT effect cognitive performance CPA healthy people . It expect TBR reduce train onset . Also , expect performance interference task improve participant start TBR Neurofeedback training . Design The investigator use single blind case series multiple baseline design baseline vary prior training onset . By randomize 12 participant three condition different training onset point time , investigator use variation baseline offer possibility differentiate time effect Neurofeedback training . All participant start three-session baseline phase include session questionnaire , interference task training ( order quickly reach learn effect ceiling well able observe additional performance change intervention ) rest state EEG measurement follow two session rest state EEG measurement interference task . Participants group A continue 14 session TBR Neurofeedback training . Group B receive six extra baseline EEG measurement continue eight TBR Neurofeedback session . Group C hand receive 14 placebo training session short baseline phase . Before every TBR Neurofeedbacktraining placebo training , four-minute EEG resting-state baseline measurement perform . The minimal number real training session ( eight ) necessary make possible observe onset effect Neurofeedback training , base previous study use TBR Neurofeedback training ( e.g . Studer et al. , 2014 ; Doppelmayr &amp; Weber , 2011 ; Leins et al. , 2007 ; Gevensleben et al. , 2009 ) . Also , high number training session important ensure possible delayed effect Neurofeedback training still observe . Procedure Before first lab session , participant stratify randomly assign one three group . All participant visit lab 17 time . During first visit , participant fill inform consent , demographic information questionnaire . They continue train letter string interference task avoid learn effect . At end first visit , EEG rest state measure . During second third visit , participant receive rest state EEG measurement perform letter string interference task . In session baseline measurement , participant receive 4 minute EEG eyes-open rest state measurement , follow either TBR Neurofeedback training placebo train depend participant group . After Neurofeedback training , rest state measurement placebo training , participant always perform letter string interference task . Sessions ( almost ) daily approximately take 50-60 minute ; except first questionnaires/interference training session take 90 minute . The complete experiment therefore take 17-19 hour per participant 4-6 week . Materials train Questionnaires The participant complete demographic information fill trait state version State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI-t , STAI-s ; Spielberger , 1983 ; Van der Ploeg et al. , 1981 ) adapt report past week first session , trait state version Attentional Control Scale ( ACS ; Derryberry &amp; Reed , 2002 ) . The STAI-t ass trait anxiety ( range 20-80 ) , STAI-s ass participant 's current state anxiety , ACS assess attentional inhibition , attentional shift , capacity flexibly generate new thought ( range 20-80 ) . The internal consistency questionnaire generally good . STAI- , ACS-t demographic questionnaire measure first session last session ( train ) . The STAI-s ACS-s assess every session EEG measurement training . Letter string interference task The Letter String interference task Bishop ( 2009 ) difference study neutral trial leave informative value cognitive interference . Neurofeedback theta/beta ratio training . The TBR Neurofeedback signal give mean NeXus-4 amplifier record system ( Mindmedia , The Netherlands ) . One Ag/AgCl disposable electrode apply participant 's scalp location Cz FCz . For high-quality accurate EEG measurement , 16 extra in-cap electrode ( BioSemi , The Netherlands ) add location F3 , Fz , F4 , C3 , Cz , C4 , P3 , Pz , P4 , T7 , TP7 , T8 , TP8 , O1 , Oz O2 ) every session . Each session consist four-minute rest state measurement , follow 25 minute measurement/Neurofeedback training placebo training . The threshold set 20 % ( beta ) ( theta ) participant 's amplitude , calculate adjust automatically every 15 second . During training , theta beta activity visualize separate bar graph screen participant instruct `` try move theta activity move beta activity threshold '' . No instruction influence activity give . When EEG theta power go threshold , beta power threshold simultaneously , participant reward continuation video . If fail reach point , video pause . The placebo training previously record Neurofeedback session participant group A ( receive 14 real Neurofeedback session ) . Before participant group C ( placebo training ) start , match participant group A , receive exact ( prerecord ) feedback per session match participant . In way , participant placebo train make think video EEG feedback , however actually able influence continuation video . Data analysis For interpret result , visual inspection primarily use determine effectiveness TBR Neurofeedback training . If TBR group A reduce introduction real Neurofeedback training compare change group C , experiment provide compelling evidence effectiveness Neurofeedback training . The effect even strongly support see similar reduction Neurofeedback training onset group A B ( equal number actual NFT session group A , regardless long duration baseline ) . These change onset group A group B assume absent group C , expect change . The expected effect group B also consider direct replication effect group A . The idealized expect change TBR depict Figure 3 ( individual line represent change TBR per group ) . These visual inspection serve test primary outcome measure . In addition primary test visual inspection , secondary , perform statistical test average TBR group A B together equal number session train onset compare group C number session group A ( i.e . session 10 group A average session 14 group B compare session 10 group C ) . Also , calculate eight separate contrast score average TBR within group A session 1 minus session 17 ; session 2 minus session 16 ; session 3 minus session 15 etc . The do group B C follow statistical comparison contrast score group A B ( take together one group ) contrast score group C. Tertiary , case group A seem evidence change TBR approximately session time per visual inspection , , test direct replication effect group B use similar permutation test method Ter Kuile et al. , ( 2009 , see also Bulté Onghena , 2008 ) The approximate time-point TBR change group A might serve designate per-session TBR data either pre- post-intervention .</detailed_description>
