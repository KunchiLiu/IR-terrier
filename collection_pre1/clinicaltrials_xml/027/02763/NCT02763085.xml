	<brief_summary>Evaluation new basic fill restorative material . In contemporary dentistry , clinician essentially three type material choice direct restoration : amalgam , resin composite , glass ionomer restorative . Due toxicity mercury subsequent environmental problem , search alternative continue search new composite restorative material intensifies . Recognized disadvantage tooth color resin base restorative material polymerization shrinkage , postoperative sensitivity technical procedure complexity . Higher rate occlusal wear low toughness disadvantage glass ionomer restorative . Therefore , alternative material develop compensate disadvantage current contemporary tooth colour restorative material . Nevertheless , search simplification restore miss dental tissue introduce `` basic filling concept '' . This project aim study clinical performance new basic fill restorative material Class I Class II cavity . 80 patient recruit project carry School dentistry , Istanbul Medipol University , Turkey .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Basic Filling Material Class I II Posterior Restorations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate clinical performance new basic fill restorative material Class I Class II cavity need restored permanent teeth . Basic fill material combine handle property glass ionomer restorative material mechanical property resin composite restorative material . Extensive laboratory study perform new material , clinical attribute yet disclose . The study carry prospective study , assessment restoration three year . The project include 80 patient . Most patient recruit Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics Istanbul . After give consent take part study Class I &amp; II restoration upper low molar premolar perform The treatment procedure : The patient offer local anesthetic treatment start . The cavity excavate filled accord guideline composite restoration . The control procedure : The restoration evaluate accord marginal adaptation , cavo surface marginal discoloration , approximal contact , fracture , caries associate restoration postoperative hypersensitivity . The control take place two week , one year , two year three year .</detailed_description>
