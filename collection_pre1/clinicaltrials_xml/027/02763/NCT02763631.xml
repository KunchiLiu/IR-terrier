	<brief_title>Symptomatic Treatment Excessive Dynamic Airway Collapse Using Daytime Portable Continuous Positive Airway Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive dynamic airway collapse ( EDAC ) tracheobronchomalacia ( TBM ) occur due abnormal weaken wall central airway lead central airway collapse expiration . This collapse responsible breathlessness , cough syncope . In adult , weaken idiopathic ( Mounier-Khun syndrome ) , secondary respiratory disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , secondary systemic disease relapse polychondritis ( RP ) secondary invasive ventilation trauma . The incidence EDAC TBM vary 12 % patient undergoing bronchoscopy 44 % patient chronic bronchitis undergo bronchoscopy . Gold standard diagnosis EDAC TBM bronchoscopy identifies quantify narrow airway . Non-invasive technique inspiratory expiratory chest computed-tomography ( CT ) also use diagnose EDAC / TBM . Currently , addition management underlie disease , treatment option EDAC / TBM limit . Surgical tracheoplasty offer associate severe post-operative complication . Airway stenting also offer , even treatment improved quality life , fail improve exercise capacity . Airway stenting also associate infectious complication well stent migration . Other endoscopic treatment Yttrium Aluminium Perovskite laser offer good result yet validate randomised trial . Nocturnal non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) also use , especially patient associated obstructive sleep apnoeas randomise clinical trial evidence validates approach adult . Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure ( EPAP ) provide pneumatic stenting prevents expiratory collapse airway . But , give NIV night , patient leave without support day whilst respiratory demand higher symptomatic . Currently , NIV give night rest current non-invasive ventilator suitable ambulatory use heavy . Recently , new portable ventilator built-in battery issue ( Z1速 , Breas速 ) . This ventilator light ( 500g ) portable work duration 8 hour . Therefore , easily carry used walking . By provide nasal pillow interface ( Nasal swift速 , Resmed速 ) patient , allow walk safely device .</detailed_description>
