	<detailed_description>Degenerative Disc Disease ( DDD ) one common spinal pathology , affect 10-15 % adult . The degeneration associate diminish water-binding capability nucleus pulpous lead disc dehydration , volume reduction , change cellular activity , biomechanical change painful symptom . Patients initially treat non-surgical pain-management technique , anti-inflammatory medication physical therapy , therapy often provide temporary relief . When non-surgical intervention fails , fusion total disc arthroplasty often prescribe , highly invasive surgery significant associate morbidity . Clearly , meaningful solution treatment gap exist conservative care invasive surgical intervention need . The purpose study evaluate efficacy treatment GelStix™ device patient population benefit conservative care . The primary objective study quantify reduction lumbar pain GelStix™ treatment group compare control group receive saline solution injection placebo . The secondary objective ass : 1. impact treatment GelStix™ disability compare control group 2. impact treatment GelStix™ health relate quality life compare control group 3. impact treatment GelStix™ reliance medication relieve pain compare control group 4. acute long-term safety GelStix™ device implant system The total expect number patient randomize 72 .
