	<brief_summary>The outcome patient relapse refractory adult T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) relate disease T-lymphoblastic lymphoma ( T-LBL ) extremely poor 30 % patient respond first salvage therapy long-term survival 10 % . Therefore , novel therapy patient relapsed/refractory T-ALL/LBL represent unmet clinical need . Recent data provide strong evidence CXCR4 signal play major role T-cell leukemia cell maintenance leukemia initiate activity , target CXCR4 signal T-ALL cell reduce tumor growth animal model . In study , investigator propose addition BL-8040 nelarabine salvage therapy patient relapsed/refractory T-ALL/LBL result high CR rate nelarabine alone without increase toxicity allow patient proceed potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Tacute lymphoblastic leukemia/ lymphoblastic lymphoma accord WHO criteria relapse refractory chemotherapy . Peripheral blood lymphoblast ≤ 50,000 mcL . Hydroxyurea and/or leukapheresis permit reduce peripheral blast count prior enrollment treatment . Age ≥ 18 year ECOG performance status ≤ 2 . Adequate organ function define : Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min use CockroftGault formula AST , ALT , total bilirubin ≤ 2 x institutional ULN except Gilbert 's disease opinion treat physician elevate level due direct involvement leukemia ( e.g. , hepatic infiltration biliary obstruction due leukemia ) , case ALT AST may elevate ≤ 5 x IULN . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception highly effective method ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Abstinence acceptable establish preferred contraception subject . Female subject must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior start study treatment childbearing potential nonchildbearing potential . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . The serum pregnancy test must negative subject eligible . Nonchildbearing potential define : *≥ 45 year age menses &gt; 2 year Amenorrheic &gt; 2 year without hysterectomy oophorectomy FSH value postmenopausal range upon pretrial ( screen ) evaluation Posthysterectomy , oophorectomy , tubal ligation . Documented hysterectomy oophorectomy must confirm medical record actual procedure confirm ultrasound . Tubal ligation must confirm medical record actual procedure . Able understand willing sign IRBapproved write informed consent document . Previous treatment nelarabine relapse refractory disease . Pregnant nursing . Received investigational agent systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within precede 2 week . Active CNS involvement leukemia Active HIV hepatitis B C infection . Any medical condition , opinion clinical investigator , would interfere evaluation patient . Subjects clinically significant unstable medical surgical condition condition wellcontrolled allow medication permit study protocol would preclude safe complete study participation , determine medical history , physical examination , laboratory test , accord investigator 's judgment .</criteria>
