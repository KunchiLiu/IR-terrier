	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Hospital inpatient care account large share total health care expense US . In 2012 , average cost per inpatient stay $ 10,400 total aggregate hospital cost $ 377.5 billion . ( Moore , 2012 ; Weiss , 2012 ) In addition expense , transition hospital represent particularly vulnerable time patient susceptible experience adverse event , especially true patient complex chronic comorbidities . For example , twenty percent Medicare patient readmitted hospital within 30 day , 20 % discharge patient suffer preventable adverse event within three week discharge . ( Rennke , 2013 ) Despite national effort improve transition , hospital discharge process largely remain chaotic , fragmented , associated poor outcome . ( Rennke , 2013 ; Hansen , 2011 ; Jack , 2009 ; Kansagara , 2015 ; Kansagara , 2011 ; &amp; Kripalani , 2014 ) . Currently , even high risk patient leave complex , acute hospital stay arrive primary care office often neither equip resourced manage challenge inherent transition . Indeed , transition high risk , complex patient require paradigm shift care delivery intensive , multidisciplinary , coordinate , encompass wrap-around services. ( http : //www.isc.hbs.edu/health-care/vbhcd/Pages/integrated-practice-units.aspx . ) RATIONALE To good enhance transition care high risk , complex patient , Carolinas HealthCare System ( CHS ) design Integrated Practice Unit , call Transition Services ( CHS-TS ) . The IPU model base concept significant improvement outcomes come physician-led , team base , integrate service focus specific condition segment population . ( http : //www.isc.hbs.edu/health-care/vbhcd/Pages/integrated-practice-units.aspx ) Also integral IPU model advance informatics platform continuously measure cost , process , patient outcome . CHS-TS aim improve patient outcomes innovative approach leverage analytics technology , bridge care coordination communication gap . During hospitalization , CHS-TS patient enter transition pathway include follow key service : integrated access medical , pharmacist , specialty provider ; access CHS disease specific management program ; dedicate care management service deliver home clinic ; lab infusion service ; palliative care consultation appropriate ; paramedicine 24 hour support . Because population face many barrier access traditional care , CHS-TS leverage virtual technology provide visit patient home set necessary appropriate . Whether virtual person , patient receive follow seven core component ( first four use marker implementation ( RE-AIM ) evaluation : ( ) Introduction CHS-TS process prior discharge ( ii ) Hospital follow-up evaluation within 72 hour either home paramedicine CHS-TS clinic ( iii ) Medication reconciliation pharmacist within 72 hour ( iv ) Weekly contact care management team ( v ) Entry Heart Success Program appropriate ( vi ) Access 24/7 phone support , 24/7 paramedicine visit , day clinic scheduling ( vii ) Coordinated transition next appropriate care location 30 day time discharge CHS strive provide extraordinary care patient communities serf . This propose evaluation design guide CHS strategy quality improvement apply research methodology data analytics support environment Learning Health System . Ultimately , CHS deploy resource intensive intervention like CHS-TS , important system patient know answer question : What type patient CHS-TS help ? ; How much benefit might expect ? ; At cost ? AIRTIGHT ( Aiming Improve Readmissions Through InteGrated Hospital Transitions ) pragmatic , randomize quality improvement evaluation , seek evaluate effect role-out CHS-TS service patient high risk 30-day readmission . This outcomes evaluation quality improvement intervention design seamless part routine care real-world setting . INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Overall Study Design AIRTIGHT pragmatic , randomized quality improvement evaluation . Patients identify risk model high risk ( &gt; 20 % ) 30-day readmission eligible CHS-TS referral ( referral eligible ) . Each weekday , referral eligible patient randomly assign CHS-TS referral total number target CHS-TS 's capacity . The CHS TS capacity revaluated daily . Because variable affect eligibility may change throughout course hospital stay , exclusion criterion apply time discharge purpose analysis . For example , patient discharge home exclude . A diagnosis heart failure also add additional exclusion criterion time discharge CHS Heart Success recruit patient similar population significant overlap service offer CHS TS CHS Heart Success . All patient remain eligible time discharge ( discharge eligible ) include analysis . Planned enrollment 1520 patient ( n=760 per arm ) engagement CHS-TS service end 30th day discharge . Outcomes data track 90 day . To mitigate risk selection bias , eligibility criterion objective determine use data analytics within software package , SAS . Additionally , analysis intention treat . With use pragmatic design , crossover CHS-TS arm usual care expect may attenuate measured effect CHS-TS . Since evaluation protocol part quality improvement intervention , investigator request CHS institutional review board designate study expedite research grant waiver inform consent . Primary Outcome Variable 30-day cause readmission index visit define Centers Medicaid Medicare Services ( CMS ) Secondary Outcome Variable ( ) 1 . 30-day cause CHS readmission ( index visit define CMS inclusion observation patient CHS facility ) 2 . Observed\Expected ratio cause , 30-day readmission 3 . Length stay upon index visit 4 . Length stay upon readmission visit 5 . All cause , 60 90-day readmission rate 6 . 30-day readmission rate among patient primary diagnosis congestive heart failure 7 . 30-day readmission rate among patient primary diagnosis pneumonia 8 . 30-day readmission rate among patient primary diagnosis sepsis 9 . Number Emergency Department visit within 30 day discharge 10 . Intensive Care Unit visit 11 . Cost effectiveness Return Investment CHS-TS versus usual care Independent Dependent Variable ( ) The dependent variable assessment 30-day cause readmission ( yes/no ) . The primary independent variable interest program assignment ( usual care vs. CHS-TS ) . Subject Selection Selection automate process generates referral list 03:00 patient admit precede 24 hour period , call CHS-TS Referral Eligible List ( REL ) . At CMC Main campus , patient enrollment occur Monday Friday , Monday REL contain admission meet criterion Friday-Sunday . At CMC Mercy campus , patient enrollment occur Tuesday Friday , Tuesday REL contain admission meet criterion Friday-Monday . The REL generate base study 's inclusion/exclusion criterion . Randomization Patients meet eligibility criterion time admission randomize one two group CHS-TS Referral Eligible List ( REL ) . A constrained randomization scheme utilized allocating referral permute block day 30 total referral ( total include CHS-TS usual care ) . The total referral base daily estimate clinic capacity . The allocation 1:1 CHS-TS : usual care .</detailed_description>
