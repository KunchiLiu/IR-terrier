	<brief_summary>Market trend depicted Agriculture Agri-Food Canada suggest stagnation cheese consumption , potentially important impact key industry Canada . This part due commonly accepted notion saturate fat diet , cheese contributes significantly , increase risk heart disease . Yet , rather large body recent evidence suggest saturate fat may unfairly demonize impact risk heart disease may fact less important originally think . This concept dairy fat increase risk heart attack therefore need revisit . The propose research design investigate risk factor heart disease ( e.g . cholesterol , blood pressure ) beneficially modify low fat ( milk ) high fat ( cheese ) dairy product consume . Our hypothesis : ( 1 ) Consumption low fat dairy ( milk 1 % fat ) compare dairy-free control diet reduces daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure reduce inflammation ; ( 2 ) Consumption high fat dairy ( GABA-rich cheese ) compare dairy-free control diet reduces daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure favorable effect LDL particle size , inflammation HDL-C concentration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center randomized crossover control feeding study . Briefly , adult men woman recruit base primarily blood pressure criterion Quebec City metropolitan area medium ( newspaper , radio ) mailing list ( n=60 ) . Participants randomize 3 experimental diet 6 week : 1- CONTROL dairy-free diet , 2- low fat dairy ( MILK , 1 % fat , 3 servings/d ) , 3- high-fat dairy ( GABA-rich cheddar cheese , approximately 32 % fat , 1 serving ( 50g ) /d ) . Usual energy intake estimate begin study use validated tool . Experimental diet provide part full feeding protocol carefully control isocaloric condition maintain body weight constant . All meal food provide participant control energy macronutrient intake optimize . The breakfast meal represent approximately 30 % daily energy intake whereas lunch dinner meal provide 35 % daily energy intake . Participants instructed consume entire meal . A seven-day cyclic menu use . We opt test impact dairy intake 6-week period ( opposed 4 5 week ) maximize chance observe clinically meaningful change blood pressure . Diets separate 4 8 week washout period . Randomization stratify sex . Blood sample collect day dietary phase 2 consecutive day dietary phase . The mean 2 consecutive measurement use analysis .</detailed_description>
