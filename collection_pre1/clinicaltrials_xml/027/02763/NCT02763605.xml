	<brief_summary>Acanthamoebic keratitis important corneal disease may cause severe complication . The difficulty diagnosis , difficulty treatment , long treatment process factor lead poor prognosis patient . In retrospective study , investigator try analyze tissue proven Acanthamoebic keratitis diagnose hospital . The investigator focus vivo confocal microscopic result , medical history medical/surgical treatment outcome . The investigator collect tissue proven case accord data provide laboratory diagnosis department pathological department . The vivo confocal microscopic result collect analyzed . The investigator also look photography external eye data store PAC system . The medical history treatment outcome study clinical chart review . From study , investigator aim find easy way diagnose Acanthamoebic keratitis vivo confocal microscopy , find good way treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Study Acanthamoebic Keratitis During Past 10 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acanthamoeba keratitis ( AK ) , cause pathogenic amoeba , sight-threatening corneal infection severe pain , epithelial defect , epithelial haze , pseudodendrites , , characteristically , radial keratoneuritis . The corneal infection AK first recognize mid 1970s . Since , grow number AK case diagnose , mainly result improper use soft contact lens . Clinical diagnosis AL difficult , especially early phase disease , often misdiagnosed treat herpes simplex infection . It report diagnostic delay 18 day onset symptoms start anti- amoebic treatment result poor disease progress . While definitive diagnosis make confirmation Acanthamoeba cysts trophozoite corneal lesion stain , corneal biopsy , tissue culturing . In vivo confocal microscopy consider useful rapid diagnosis AK . The Acanthamoeba cyst observe almost exclusively epithelial cell layer highly reflective , round stellate , high-contrast particle diameter 10 20 μm . It suggest invasion Acanthamoeba cysts Bowman 's layer may useful predictor persistent clinical course . The trophozoite pear-shaped irregularly wedge-shaped structure , surround brilliant halo exhibit fine pseudopodia-like extension , mean size 30.2 µm ( range 19.2-55.6μm ) . It report present cornea stroma . Highly reflective activate keratocytes form honeycomb pattern change report present around keratoneuritis . In addition , infiltration inflammatory cell , possibly polymorphonuclear cell , observe along keratocytes case AK . However , vivo confocal microscopic finding patient AK still limit . Some clinical finding may correlate report publish . John K.G . et al recommend clinical treatment toward Acanthamoeba keratitis use Diamidine Biguanide two proofed Acanthamoeba cysticidal medication , Metronidazole effective vivo vitro . Topical steroid consider rather controversial important beneficial . It recommend use minimum 2 week Biguanide prior use topical steroid inflammation control . When Acanthamoeba keratitis diagnose early disease course , topical steroid spar immediate use Diamidine Biguanide kill pathogen . In United Kingdom multicenter study 218 patient , average duration medical therapy 6 month ( range , 0.5 29 month ) . In 2011 , little half respondent use corticosteroid treatment Acanthamoeba keratitis . Surgical management include epithelial debridement , cryotherapy corneal graft surgery may therapeutic perform early promote penetration . Therefore , Acanthamoeba keratitis suspect , long-term immediate medical treatment may need , use topical steroid toward Acanthamoeba keratitis still worth investigate .</detailed_description>
