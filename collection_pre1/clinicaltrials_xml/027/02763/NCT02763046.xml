	<brief_summary>The current study ass clinical Assessment SpondyloArthritis international Society ( ASAS ) 20 response Secukinumab evaluate extent concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) treatment reduce patient treat Secukinumab placebo follow initial run-in phase stable NSAID therapy . In case positive outcome concern NSAID reduction study could trigger development guidance concern NSAID reduction applicable Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) patient start biologic treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-blind , Placebo-controlled Multicenter Study Secukinumab ( AIN457 ) Examine Clinical Efficacy Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug ( NSAID ) -Sparing Effect Secukinumab Over 16 Weeks Patients With Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study ass clinical Assessment SpondyloArthritis international Society ( ASAS ) 20 response Secukinumab evaluate extent concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) treatment reduce Week 4 Week 12 patient treat Secukinumab 150 mg placebo follow initial run-in phase 4 week stable NSAID therapy . Two different time point NSAID taper initiation evaluate study : 1. delay taper approach NSAID taper follow 4 week Secukinumab treatment stable NSAID therapy . 2. early taper approach NSAID taper immediately initiation Secukinumab treatment . These two approach evaluate compare placebo order ass whether early delay NSAID taper superior placebo term clinical ASAS20 response extent reduction NSAID intake . As patient-reported outcome , pain major patient-relevant efficacy parameter clinical practice Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) . This study therefore monitor overall neck , back hip pain continuous basis . It recommend NSAID taper patient report improvement back pain level certain threshold . It anticipate result study may provide guidance systematic adjustment concomitant NSAID treatment AS patient base initial response Secukinumab , thereby lead optimization therapeutic strategy Secukinumab .</detailed_description>
