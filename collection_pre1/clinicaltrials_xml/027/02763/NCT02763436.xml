	<brief_summary>The first major intervention newborn infant facing follow birth clamp umbilical cord . This mean separation infant placenta , newborn becomes independent individual , especially cardio-circulatory perspective . Recent literature focus much appropriate timing cord clamping ( CC ) , distinguish immediate cord clamping ( ICC ) delay cord clamping ( DCC ) . Although potential benefit DCC document , especially preterm infant , ICC still widely used procedure . Although reason unclear , lack understanding issue associate umbilical cord clamp think major underlying factor . In animal research fetal lambs show , aeration lung play crucial role undisturbed cardio-circulatory immediate neonatal transition . Thus new concept DCC introduce , delay cord clamp ventilation/aeration lung establish , call `` Physiological-Based Cord Clamping '' ( PBCC ) . It show , PBCC improve cardiovascular function preterm lamb , systemic cerebral oxygenation . Systemic oxygenation measure use pulseoximetry , cerebral oxygenation measure use near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Until , human data PBCC lacking . Therefore , aim present study investigate whether PBCC able improve systemic cerebral oxygenation term infant deliver vaginally .</brief_summary>
