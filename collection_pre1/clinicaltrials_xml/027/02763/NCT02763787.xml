	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part , separate group subject participate part . Part 1 design follow : - Single centre , Phase I , double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled study investigate single rise oral dos BIA 3-202 800 mg sequential group nine healthy male adult subject . - Within group nine subject , two randomise receive placebo remain seven randomise receive BIA 3-202 . - No subject member one treatment group . - Doses BIA 3-202 investigate ascend order . - The low propose dose BIA 3-202 ( 10 mg ) investigate first instance . - Progression next high dose occur previous dose level deem safe well tolerated investigator sponsor . - Following discussion investigator sponsor intermediate repeat dose level could administer deemed appropriate increase safety scientific value first man exploratory study . - An appropriate interval least 7 day separate investigation dose level permit timely review evaluation safety data prior proceed high dose level . The proposed dos use Part 1 study 10 mg , 30 mg , 50 mg , 100 mg , 200 mg , 400 mg 800 mg . In Part 2 study , additional group eight subject receive single dose BIA 3-202 , either fast overnight high fat meal , open label two-way crossover design . Each treatment separated period least 7 day . The dose administer Part 2 determine safety pharmacokinetic data Part 1 study . Following review Part 1 data , protocol amendment 1 issue , state dose BIA 3-202 use 400 mg . Screening Potential subject screen eligibility within 28 day admission . Screening consisted review medical history , physical examination , neurological examination , vital sign , 12 lead ECG , clinical laboratory safety test ( haematology , coagulation plasma biochemistry , urinalysis , urinary microproteins , HbsAg , anti-HCV HIV I &amp; II , drug abuse alcohol screen ) . Treatment Periods The result screen known Investigator prior subject 's admission . On admission inclusion/exclusion criterion review subject write informed consent obtain . Eligible subject admit unit one treatment period ( group 1-7 , Part 1 study ) two treatment period ( group 8 , Part 2 ) , day prior receive trial medication remain unit clinical supervision least 24 hour post dose . BIA 3-202 /placebo administer orally morning day 1 . Safety evaluate monitoring adverse event , clinical laboratory safety test ( haematology , biochemistry , coagulation , urinalysis , urinary microproteins ) , vital sign , 12-lead ECG , physical examination , include brief neurological examination . Blood sample urine collection take pre-determined time-points assay BIA 3-202 metabolite BIA 3-270 . Blood sample also take assessment COMT activity erythrocytes . Follow Up Subjects attend follow visit 5-7 day follow last discharge . At follow-up , medical history adverse event review , clinical laboratory safety test perform .</detailed_description>
