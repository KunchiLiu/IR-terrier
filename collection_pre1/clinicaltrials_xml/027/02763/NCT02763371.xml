	<detailed_description>Glucose main fuel human brain . However , impact glycemic index lunch cognitive performance clear . A recently publish review Philippou Constantinou suggest cautiously low-GI meal may favor cognitive function adult , note finding inconclusive due difference study design , study sample ( e.g . size , age ) , time test cognitive domain examine . Because cerebral particularity , child may react highly sensitive variation glycose supply . Therefore , optimise composition meal favourable mealtime consider optimal cognitive performance . The increase implementation all-day school Germany require child 's cater lunch school . As prior intake food influence physiological effect test meal , child 's dietary intake mid-morning standardize . The intervention integrate everyday school life : 9.15 a.m. standardized snack within frame regular break , 9.45 a.m. 12.25 p.m. everyday school life , 12.25 p.m. lunch high GI-rice low GI-rice water beverage , 12.45 p.m. 13.15 p.m. regular lunch break , 13.15 p.m. computerized test executive cognitive basal ( alertness ) functioning .
