	<brief_summary>There lack data analyze influence Cardio-vascular Diseases ( CVD ) risk factor control graft survival disparity Black transplant recipient . Studies general population indicate CVD risk factor control poor Black patient , lead high rate renal failure CV event . However , exception hypertension , paucity data demonstrate similar result within transplant recipient . Recent analysis conduct within transplant program , indicate CVD risk factor , especially diabetes , poorly control Black recipient , likely impact graft loss . Since data collect retrospective manner , large analysis need validate exploratory finding . This pilot study : 1 . Determine study feasible , measured proportion enrol approached complete enrol . 2 . Measure compare , baseline versus end intervention , medication safety event , include number medication error , medication non-adherence medication side effect , patient enrol study 3 . Measure compare , baseline versus end intervention , CVD risk factor control , include hypertension , diabetes dyslipidemia , patient enrol study 4 . Measure compare , baseline versus end intervention , patient report survey result , patient enrol study 5 . Determine impact intervention pronounce Black recipient , compare non-Black recipient</brief_summary>
