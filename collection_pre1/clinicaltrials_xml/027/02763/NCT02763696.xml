	<brief_summary>The vaginal microbiota important biological barrier host pathogen opportunistic pathogen . Undermining balance vagina closely related infectious disease tumor . The vaginal microbiota child-bearing woman age dominate Lactobacillus specie , include major four specie : Lactobacillus crispatus , Lactobacillus jensenii , Lactobacillus gasseri Lactobacillus iners , follow obligate anaerobe Gardnerella vaginalis , Atopobium vagina , Mobiluncus curtisii , Prevotella . Currently , There almost 99 % bacteria find bacterial culture . Based microscopy conventional culture method obtain vaginal microflora information variety deviation . For reason , The in-depth study complex vaginal flora correct understanding disease face serious obstacle . With development High-throughput sequencing technologyï¼Œ metagenomics get composition distribution microorganism sample traditional knowledge may microorganism culture method . Therefore , Re-evaluation exist microflora diagnostic criterion clinical diagnosis disease necessary . In study , investigator use high-throughput sequencing technology detect woman childbearing age vaginal microflora metagenomic distribution . Including bacteria , fungi , virus , protozoa , microorganism . Based study result metagenomic , investigator want re-cognition '' normal flora '' woman childbearing age , develop vaginal microflora microscopic evaluation integrity reference standard .</brief_summary>
