	<brief_summary>Consuming plant chemical ( e.g. , polyphenols ) may beneficial effect human health , confirm , may warrant inclusion combat ration . Ration developer would like determine whether fortification high sugar food item polyphenol-rich freeze-dried fruit and/or fruit extract improve blood sugar response promote positive physiological change ( e.g. , satiety ) dose-response manner . This study test four different type snack bar various polyphenol dos , compare blood response snack bar without polyphenols .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postprandial Glycemic Response Polyphenol-fortified Snack Bars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High glycemic index ( GI ) food generally contain simple sugar and/or highly process refine carbohydrate ( e.g. , instant oatmeal white bread ) . These food rapidly digest , raise blood glucose insulin high concentration rapidly compare low GI food item . In situation , advantageous consume high glycemic response food item promote recovery intense exercise/work . However , suggestion low/moderate-GI food may better maintain glucose level enhance performance consume prolonged exercise . Further , impair blood glucose regulation ( e.g. , occur chronic intake high GI food ) may stimulate development oxidative stress , inflammation , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , diabetes ; , associate change body weight due stimulating hunger excessive food intake . These negative consequence concern , give prevalence overweight/obesity comorbidities ( include metabolic syndrome ) within Department Defense ( DoD ) . Polyphenols heterogeneous group phytochemical find plant-based food ; antioxidant anti-inflammatory property may ultimately help protect chronic disease , cancer cardiometabolic disease . Berry polyphenols predominantly comprise proanthocyanidins and/or ellagitannins ( collectively refer `` tannin '' ) ; , berry show promote glycemic control consume high-carbohydrate containing food item . These beneficial health effect may warrant polyphenol fortification combat ration Garrison food item . For example , Natick Soldier Research , Development Engineering Center 's ( NSRDEC ) Combat Feeding Directorate demonstrate tannin extracted berry effectively inhibit activity enzyme metabolize starch vitro , underlie mechanism slow starch digestion vivo . However , whether consumption high GI food item contain polyphenol-rich freeze-dried fruit and/or fruit extract improve glucose control , reduces oxidative stress , promote satiety human volunteer unknown . In randomized , cross-over , placebo-controlled , dose-response trial , least 20 civilian and/or military personnel ask consume one five food item separate trial : 1 ) high glycemic snack bar ( control ) without fruit ingredient ; 2 ) high glycemic snack bar cranberry extract ( 0.5 % total weight ) ; 3 ) high glycemic snack bar cranberry extract ( 1 % total weight ) ; 4 ) high glycemic bar freeze-dried black raspberry ( 10 % total weight ) ; , 5 ) high glycemic snack bar freeze-dried black raspberry ( 20 % total weight ) . Serial blood sample measure acute change circulate glucose , insulin , gastrointestinal hormone biomarkers oxidative stress satiety occur baseline three hour consumption food . Appetite also assess ad libitum meal three hour period . The known risk , study present participant , associate venous catheter placement . The fruit concentrate present study either commercially available ( black raspberry powder ) use ingredient boost phenolic content commercial item ( cranberry extract ) . The result help determine whether fortify high glycemic food item polyphenols may benefit Warfighter ration- Garrison-feeding environment .</detailed_description>
