	<detailed_description>This randomize , SoC-controlled , open-label , multi-center study patient TAM hematopoietic precursor cell transplantation ( HPCT ) . Study consist 28 day screen period , 16 week treatment period extend 45 week , 36 week follow , end study visit ( EOS ) week 52 . Duration follow depend duration treatment . Patients treat 41 week proceed directly EOS visit . Approximately 40 patient randomized receive SoC LFG316 plus SoC . Patients include study diagnosis TAM poor prognostic marker . Patients show worsen disease two week treatment show response week 4 time consider failure switch receive alternative treatment ( SoC LFG316 ) . Patients switch treatment arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent/assent studyspecific screening procedure . For pediatric patient , consent obtain parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) signature least 1 parent guardian require . Investigators also obtain assent patient accord local , regional national guideline . 2 . Patients allogeneic stem cell transplantation relate unrelated , HLAmatched mismatch donor diagnosis transplant relate microangiopathy . Patients receive follow stem cell source eligible : GCSF mobilize peripheral blood stem cell , bone marrow , umbilical cord blood . 3 . Male female TAM patient ≥ 2 year old time first dose administration . Patients &lt; 12 year old include study first IA show safe well tolerated patient ≥ 12 year old ( Section 3.5 ) . 4 . The presence TAM per diagnostic criterion baseline ( screen baseline visit skip ) . All criterion meet patient include study : Elevated lactate dehydrogenase ( elevation normal range ) Thrombocytopenia platelet count &lt; 50x10e9/L 50 % decrease platelet count high value achieve transplant Anemia low limit normal anemia require transfusion support per center standard Schistocytes peripheral blood smear ( &gt; 2 per HPF ) OR histologic evidence microangiopathy Absence coagulopathy ( uncompensated disseminate intravascular coagulation , DIC ) screen 5 . The presence TAM high risk feature baseline ( screen baseline visit skip ) : Patients ≤ 16 year must Lansky score ≤ 70 patient &gt; 16 must Karnofsky score ≤ 70 % and/or proteinuria ( &gt; 30 mg/dL ) measure two urine spot analysis . 6 . Hypertension , define adult SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 100 mmHg baseline ( screen baseline visit skip ) , pediatric patient blood pressure great 95th percentile age , sex , height ( see Table 161 ) . Additionally , patient start antihypertensive medication HSCT receive additional antihypertensive medication HSCT eligible , even n't elevate blood pressure . 7 . Able receive antibiotic prophylaxis N. meningitides duration study . 8 . Meningococcal vaccine ( ) prior LFG316 treatment prior vaccination confirm . The choice vaccine ( ) take account serotypes prevalent geographic area study patient enrol . In case vaccination possible result unfavorable risk benefit ratio judge investigator , vaccination postpone deem likely effective . 9 . Patients &lt; 18 year old receive vaccination prevention S. pneumoniae H. influenzae type b prior LFG316 administration . In case vaccination possible result unfavorable risk benefit ratio judge investigator , vaccination postpone deem likely effective . 10 . Weight least 10kg . 1 . Use investigational drug time enrollment , within 5 halflives enrollment , expect PD effect return baseline , whichever longer ; even longer required local regulation . Concomitant investigational treatment , include treatment context clinical trial market drug ( offlabel ) may acceptable require approval sponsor case case basis . 2 . Known hypersensitivity constituent study medication . 3 . Patients steroid refractory graft versus host disease ( SRGvHD ) . SRGvHD define progression ( =increase overall grade ) 5 day ≥2mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent OR improvement ( decrease overall grade ) 10 day ≥ 2mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent . If patient receive steroid GvHD prophylaxis per center standard , progression 5 day response 10 day double steroid dose regard steroid refractory . 4 . Patients ALT &gt; 10x ULN screening . 5 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( screen baseline ) . 6 . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose 45 day stop study medication . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( i.e. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) , total hysterectomy tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment . Male sterilization ( least 6 prior screening ) . The vasectomized male partner sole partner subject . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception . In case use oral contraception woman stabile pill minimum 3 month take study treatment . 7 . Sexually active male unwilling use condom intercourse take drug 45 day stop investigational medication . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Male patient father child period . 8 . Positive HIV ( ELISA Western blot ) test result ( checked screening ) . Historical local data acceptable test do within one month start HSCT condition 3 month study visit 3 . 9 . A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C test result screening . Historical local data acceptable test do within one month start HSCT condition 3 month study visit 3 . 10 . Patients severe , progressive uncontrolled acute chronic medical condition ( uncontrolled infectious disease sepsis ) clinical laboratory abnormality investigator 's opinion would make patient inappropriate entry study ( screen baseline ) . 11 . Patients proven TTP per historical data ( defined ADAMST13 activity test ) already available result ADAMST13 test do screening . 12 . Patients previously treat eculizumab TAM . 13 . Patients know suspected hereditary complement pathway deficiency . This exclusion criterion applicable patient complement pathway abnormalities/upregulation know associate increase risk transplant associate microangiopathy</criteria>
