	<brief_summary>The human body use vestibular feedback coordination visual somatosensory information maintain balance posture . However , various inner-ear disorder due age , drug toxicity , viral infection , injury , etc. , may result loss vestibular feedback , make difficult individual maintain balance . This study investigate use hidden noninvasive balance device EquiCue™ V1 develop Innervo Technology vestibular substitution . EquiCue™ V1 retainer-like intraoral electronic balance aid entirely worn inside oral cavity provide in-situ sensory feedback head tilt motion roof mouth . The feedback deliver apply small controlled electrical pulse precise location palatal surface accord encode pattern . This pilot study determine alternative sensory feedback roof mouth use improve balance patient vestibular loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Vestibular imbalance prevalent United States around world . According NIDCD , 4 % ( 8 million ) American adult report chronic problem balance ( visit vestibular.org information ) . The lead cause imbalance vestibular dysfunction . Various vestibular disorder due age , disease , ototoxicity , injury , etc . cause damage degradation vestibular system , result loss vestibular feedback . Symptoms associate vestibular loss include : difficulty maintain straight posture ; stumble unable walk straight ; lose balance uneven surface dim light ; float sensation tendency look downward confirm location ground . Vestibular imbalance greatly increase risk fall disable effect range reduced activity level total loss mobility . Vestibular rehabilitation therapy ( VRT ) may help vestibular patient compensate vision proprioception . However , compensation adequate brain often need reliable reference order use visual somatosensory information perception self-motion spatial orientation . Consequently , many patient vestibular imbalance fail compensate , especially profound vestibular loss . Even respond VRT may experience constant physical mental stress due overreliance vision proprioception mislead busy environment . EquiCue™ Intraoral Balance Aid The intraoral balance aid EquiCue™ V1 hidden noninvasive balance device vestibular patient use various indoor outdoor activity . It retainer-like device entirely worn inside oral cavity , need surgical implantation , remove use . The device provide in-situ sensory feedback head tilt motion apply small electrical pulse roof mouth . By sense feedback device , individual vestibular loss well judgment tilt motion head make physical adjustment accordingly well balance body . Since device cause alteration appearance user , patient may use public place shop mall , supermarket , metro station , offer balance assistance improve postural stability gait busy environment . Human Subject Study The current study initial stage clinical trial use EquiCue™ patient vestibular imbalance . The hypothesis EquiCue™ least partially substitute lose vestibular function therefore help vestibular patient achieve good postural stability daily activity . The basic question regard technology : 1 ) How represent head movement use electrical pulse palate ; 2 ) Whether electrotactile presentation palate reliably recognize used balance control . The study also help understand role multisensory integration balance , especially impact alternative sensory feedback balance system . Subjects participate study expect wear custom-made retainer-like device perform movement test balance . If patient determine suitable subject , sensitivity profile palate patient measure . After EquiCue™ intraoral device custom make , patient ask fit device inside mouth , verify basic functionality device identify direction , perceive intensity , sensory characteristic stimuli device . The subject go 3-4 session train test subject try associate feedback head movement integrate feedback sens achieve good spatial orientation balance . The improvement balance gait device evaluate use standard test balance platform ( Computerized Dynamic Posturograpy ) Dynamic Gait Index . Tests make without wear device begin wear device end training session .</detailed_description>
