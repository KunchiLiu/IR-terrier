	<brief_summary>The use TEVAR increase rapidly patient even young patient . However , current endografts several order magnitude stiffer native aorta . Pre-clinical clinical study report acute aortic stiffening TEVAR result hypertension , elevate pulse pressure , cardiac remodeling , reduce coronary perfusion , finally , heart failure . These effect markedly profound young patient , heart aortas compliant . Previous study adverse cardiovascular remodel important limitation , retrospective design , use echocardiography ( low reproducibility high operator-dependency ) , mixed population . A systematic assessment deleterious effect TEVAR still miss . The objective study perform prospective , non-randomized control , study blood pressure , heart rate , ECG , echocardiography , CT , MRI , intra-luminal hemodynamic assessment , computational modeling biomarkers use assess cardiovascular remodel follow TEVAR . This study target patient thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAA ) penetrate aortic ulcer ( PAU ) treat TEVAR . A control group consist TAA PAU subject require endovascular treatment . The specific aim study include : 1 ) Quantification cardiovascular remodel follow TEVAR TAA PAU patient . 2 ) Validation computational modeling thoracic aortic hemodynamics follow TEVAR use clinical measurement . Once validate , computational analysis perform virtually assess impact compliant endografts cardiac aortic hemodynamics . 3 ) Investigation diagnostic accuracy ECG , BNP , NT-pro-BNP Troponin T , cardiac remodeling compare MRI , reference method . This study assess impact thoracic aortic stent graft cardiovascular system non-invasive measurement . Although direct benefit enrol subject , future aortic patient might benefit well patient management improve aortic endograft design long-term outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CardiOvascular Remodeling Following Endovascular Aortic Repair ( CORE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient Population Clinical Measurements : The Frankel Cardiovascular Center University Michigan Health System ( UMHS ) regional center expertise manage large variety aortic disease . Only adult patient ( age 18-99 year ) include . Patients include regardless race ethnicity . The patient population consist : 1 . Patients descend thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAA ) . TAA define balloon-like dilatation thoracic aorta . Such dilatation may grow eventually rupture , associate high mortality . In United States , 10,000 patient die every year due rupture aneurysm . Current United States guideline state diameter TAA patient connective tissue disorder large 55-60 mm , aortic repair recommend . To date , TEVAR first choice therapy unless anatomy unsuitable patient connective tissue disorder . 2 . Patients penetrate aortic ulcer ( PAU ) . PAU chronic aortic condition , define ulcer-like disruption inner aortic wall . Up 28 % patient PAU may may develop aortic aneurysm . Treatment TEVAR recommend patient , especially patient complicate aortic growth rupture . Study Design : TEVAR Group . In study , investigator target TAA PAU treat TEVAR . Patients identify clinic setting . Patients plan treatment TEVAR TAA PAU ( base treat physician 's decision ) give information observational study . Results standard work-up examination TEVAR , consist compute tomography ( CT ) , echocardiography , blood ( BP ) heart ( HR ) measurement , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) collect . Once patient consent confirm , prior TEVAR procedure , study include non-invasive MRI scan blood collection biomarker data , addition standard care . In study , TEVAR procedure , intraluminal pressure measurement conduct use catheter guidewires already place deployment endograft . This study neither delay modify endovascular procedure . One year ( window 275 - 455 day ) follow TEVAR procedure , subject undergo second non-invasive MRI study addition standard clinical image follow-up . During follow-up imaging , patient also undergo BP HR measurement , ECG blood test . Control Group . Patients stable TAA PAU require surgery monitor outpatient clinic standard care . In study , patient give information study ask included investigation . Once consent patient confirm , participant undergo BP HR measurement , ECG , blood test , one non-invasive MRI scan , baseline . One year ( window 275 - 455 day ) baseline , participant undergo additional observation ; non-invasive MRI study , BP HR measurement , ECG blood test . Clinical Measurements : BP , HR , ECG , blood- test collect trained personnel baseline , one year ( window 275 - 455 day ) follow-up . - BP HR measure per standard protocol . - ECG consist standard 12 lead ECG . - Standard blood test include complete blood count platelet ( include white blood cell , hemoglobin , hematocrit , red blood cell ) , basic metabolic panel ( include sodium , potassium , glucose , calcium . Cardiac biomarkers test include natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , amino-terminal pro-BNP ( NT-pro-BNP ) Troponin T. Echocardiography - Preoperative echocardiography standard care patient require TEVAR . The obtained echocardiographic measurement patient collect compare preoperative MRI data . Intraluminal pressure - During TEVAR , angiography perform standard care . In study , intraluminal pressure measurement conduct TEVAR group , use catheter guidewires already place deployment endograft , commonly do UMHS . MRI - This study employ follow clinical ( FDA/IRB approve ) research MRI sequence assess multiple sign cardiovascular remodeling : Clinical sequence : 1 . Phase-contrast MRI measurement acquire different cross-sections aorta ( through-plane velocity-encoding ) . Images also capture oblique sagittal view ( in-plane velocity-encoding ) estimate aortic vessel wall stiffness via pulse wave velocity measurement . Velocity-encoded phase-contrast MRI image acquire across mitral valve evaluate leave ventricular ( LV ) diastolic function measurement early-to-atrial ratio . Myocardial perfusion image acquire administration gadolinium base contrast agent pharmacological stress . 2 . Cine measurement include LV volume , LV wall volume leave atrial volume . 3 . Tag-MRI measure different component myocardial strain standard short-axis four-chamber view . Research sequence : 1 . Strain encoding sequence measure cardiac- aortic strain . This sequence IRB approve : IRBMED # 2004-0452 . 2 . Steady state free precession sequence measure strain thoracic aorta cine measurement ascend aorta distal coronary branch proximal celiac trunk . The sequence obtain accordance within FDA safety guideline FDA approve MRI machine . It easily reproducible quantifiable confirms MRI safety parameter United States . All measurement non-invasive therefore impose additional risk burden patient . Contrast administer , except patient poor renal function ( eGFR &lt; 60 ) . The total anticipated scan time approximately 1 hour . Computational Modeling - Using image clinical data , simulation blood flow pressure perform use computational fluid dynamic ( CFD ) techniques High-Performance Computer cluster `` Flux '' University Michigan . Highly detailed description velocity , flow , pressure , wall shear stress hemodynamically significant quantity obtain . The result non-invasive simulation compare clinical measurement ( BP , HR , echocardiography , MRI , intraluminal pressure ) calibrate tool . Once calibrate , computational analysis perform virtually assess impact compliant endografts cardiac aortic hemodynamics . Statistical Analysis - Statistical analysis include descriptive comparative analysis clinical measurement data acquire computational modeling . In analysis , participant group TEVAR Control group . Sub-analysis include group endograft length , gender , age . The patient identify information protect health data dealt base HIPAA guideline . Preliminary echocardiographic data TAA patient treat TEVAR University Michigan Health System reveal average LV mass increase 39 % ( P = 0.047 ) 1-year follow-up . Power analysis Mann-Whitney U test , base preliminary data , calculate significant threshold 5 % ( P &lt; 0.05 , two-sided test ) total sample size 20 patient ( Î± = 0.05 , power = 97 % ) would need observe significant effect TEVAR LV mass increase . To ensure margin error , investigator aim include 12 TEVAR patient 12 control patient . To sum , end-goal study assess impact TEVAR adverse cardiovascular remodel image computation . This impact remain unclear may carry important implication patient management future endograft design . The additional measurement require study almost risk-free included participant . Although direct benefit enrol subject , future aortic patient might benefit well patient management improve aortic endograft design long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
