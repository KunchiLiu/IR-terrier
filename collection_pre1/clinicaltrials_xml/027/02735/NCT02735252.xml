	<brief_summary>This tissue blood collection protocol require image-guided biopsy metastatic prostate cancer . Whenever possible , new bone lesion new/progressing soft tissue lesion choose biopsy oppose radiographically stable lesion . Patients enrol parallel one five patient cohort base modality plan recently initiate systemic therapy , well disease setting : ( A ) Androgen signal inhibitor , ( B ) Immunotherapy , ( C ) Chemotherapy , ( D ) Targeted therapy , ( E ) Castration-sensitive disease . Patients cohort E enrol one two group : Group 1 ( treatment-naïve ) , Group 2 ( pre-treated ) ( see previous section definition ) . Patients enrol Cohorts A-D , well Cohort E group 1 , undergo baseline tumor biopsy prior initiation next line systemic therapy . For patient enrolled Cohort E , group 2 , patient undergo first tumor biopsy 6-8 month first dose LHRH analogue deliver treatment metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After perform tumor biopsy process biopsy , researcher perform comprehensive molecular analysis use establish method RNA DNA sequence . The researcher also collect blood sample ( circulate tumor DNA , plasma , serum ) circulate tumor cell participate patient . Residual paraffin-embedded block , frozen tissue , blood product ( serum , plasma , circulate cell ) store repository future test candidate predictive marker identify microarray analysis . Whenever possible , researcher utilize CLIA-certified laboratory identify genetic mutation within mCRPC tumor provide genetic information return patient potentially inform treatment decision . Following biopsy , patient treat per investigator discretion , treatment corresponding assign patient cohort . Patients evaluate every 3 month response therapy , serum PSA staging scan clinically indicate . Outcomes treatment post-biopsy record , include maximal PSA decline , date radiographic progression . For cohort A-D ( mCRPC ) , time disease progression PCWG2 criterion , patient may undergo optional repeat tumor biopsy , along blood collection analysis circulate tumor DNA CTCs . For cohort E , group 1 , patient undergo optional repeat tumor biopsy 6-8 month start androgen deprivation therapy , along mandatory blood collection ctDNA CTC analysis . For cohort E , group 2 , patient undergo optional repeat tumor biopsy time development castration resistance define PCWG2 criterion , along mandatory blood collection ctDNA CTC analysis . All patient follow long term survival every 3 month telephone call and/or chart review .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>History histologically confirm prostate cancer . Patients without histologically confirm prostate cancer eligible treat physician study PI agree patient 's history unambiguously indicative advanced prostate cancer ( e.g . high PSA responsive Androgen Deprivation Therapy . ) Radiographic evidence metastatic disease amenable imageguided biopsy metastatic site . Softtissue well bony metastatic lesion consider acceptable . Patients locally advanced disease ( biopsy would prostatic mass ) eligible . Biopsy newly emerge progressive metastasis desire preferable biopsy previously exist stable lesion whenever possible . Platelets &gt; 75,000/μl PT INR PTT &lt; 1.5 time institutional ULN within 14 day prior biopsy . Patients warfarin , aspirin , anticoagulant eligible provide deem able tolerate discontinuation anticoagulation prior biopsy per usual standard care . Conversion low molecular weight heparin prior biopsy permit per local standard operating procedure , provide agreement regard procedure treat physician , interventional radiologist PI . Patients significant congenital acquire bleed disorder ( eg type 3 von Wildebrand 's disease , acquire bleed factor inhibitor ) eligible . Age &gt; 18 yr ECOG Performance status 02 ( see appendix A ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Additional Inclusion Criteria Cohorts AD : Metastatic , castration resistant disease PCWG2 criterion , progression recently apply systemic therapy prior study registration , define : PSA Progression : PSA level least 2 ng/ml rise least 2 successive occasion , least one week apart . and/or Soft tissue progression : RECIST v1.1 and/or Bone scan progression : appearance ≥ 2 new lesion and/or Symptomatic progression area radiologically evident disease Documented serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL . Patients without prior bilateral orchiectomy require remain LHRH analogue duration study . Patient plan therapy androgen signal inhibitor ( cohort A ) , immunotherapy ( cohort B ) , chemotherapy ( cohort C ) , target therapy ( cohort D ) . Therapeutic combination allow treatment may fall one category cohort assignment per PI discretion . Treatment must plan start within 28 day baseline tumor biopsy . Additional Inclusion Criteria Cohort E : Metastatic hormonenaïve prostate cancer plan start ( Group 1 ) currently receive ( Group 2 ) androgen deprivation therapy . The use chemotherapy investigational agent allow require Group 1 Group 2 . Group 1 ( ADTNaïve ) : Patients receive LHRH analogue , LHRH antagonist antiandrogen metastatic disease . Prior use androgen deprivation therapy ( neo ) adjuvant , salvage , biochemically recurrent set allow provide last day effective androgen deprivation 12 month prior study entry . Androgen deprivation therapy must plan start within 28 day baseline tumor biopsy . Group 2 ( ADT PreTreated ) : Patients initiate androgen deprivation therapy ( include LHRH agonist , antagonist and/or antiandrogens ) metastatic prostate cancer within 6 month prior study entry .</criteria>
