	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study well myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) clinical assay work find monitor cancer cell blood urine sample patient without localize metastatic bladder cancer . Studying sample blood urine patient without bladder cancer laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer may help doctor improve way diagnose treat patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MDSC Clinical Assay Finding Monitoring Cancer Cells Blood Urine Samples From Patients With Without Localized Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate novel clinical assay ( MDSC clinical assay ) detect cancer associate immune cell peripheral blood patient mean good detect monitor malignant bladder cancer patient . II . Estimate mean MDSC level , intra-patient variability , inter-patient variability , 3 group subject variable bladder cancer disease status baseline . III . In patient know localized , muscle-invasive bladder cancer undergo surgical treatment : determine change MDSC level baseline treatment include surgery . IV . In patient know metastatic bladder cancer undergo systemic treatment : determine change MDSC level baseline 4 cycle treatment compare change tumor burden evaluate radiographic imaging . V. In patient history cancer : determine change MDSC level baseline 4 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare MDSC level measurement urine cytology analysis baseline treatment determine whether two test correlate 3 group patient define study . OUTLINE : GROUP I : Patients without cancer undergo collection blood urine sample analysis via MDSC clinical assay baseline , 1 week , 4 month . GROUP II : Patients localized bladder cancer undergo collection blood urine sample analysis via MDSC clinical assay baseline , 1 week , within 4 week cystectomy . GROUP III : Patients metastatic cancer undergo collection blood urine sample analysis via MDSC clinical assay baseline , 1 week , within 4 week completion 4 course systemic chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
