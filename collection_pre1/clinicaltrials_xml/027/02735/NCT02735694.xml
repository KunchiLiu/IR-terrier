	<brief_summary>This study conduct determine whether cycloserine effective treatment sleep apnea . Cycloserine antibiotic extensively use treatment tuberculosis . However , recently show enhance memory response . Cycloserine may enhance response respiratory muscle apnea potentially reduce severity sleep disorder breathing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cycloserine Treatment Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The passive human upper airway ( UA ) collapsible tube relatively high compliance . At atmospheric luminal pressure , cross-sectional area varies considerably . Subjects pharynx close , nearly close , near atmospheric pressure require upper airway dilate force maintain adequate ventilation . During wakefulness pharyngeal dilator muscle ( dilator ) provide necessary force permit adequate flow , regardless collapsible pharynx . This dilator activity substantially lose sleep onset . Subjects passive UA permit adequate ventilation must recruit dilator reflex mechanism remain asleep . Recent study show activation muscle open airway course obstructive apneas persists variable degree relief obstruction , evidence presence memory prior activation brain center supply dilator muscle . Short-term potentiation ( STP ) neuro-physiological mechanism result time-dependent increase motor activity , explainable change stimulus intensity , persist disappearance stimulus ( `` after-discharge '' ) . STP well document diaphragmatic response chemical stimulus . Prominent STP upper airway muscle would promote strong dilator response upper airway occlusion . The after-discharge would also help maintain dilator activity follow ventilatory phase obstructive event , thereby mitigate recurrence obstruction . Patients obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) vary greatly extent memory STP present . The investigator postulate intervention could potentiate development memory prior activation would mitigate recurrence apnea reduce severity obstructive sleep apnea . The intervention , enhance memory prior activation , would also likely improve central apnea apneas represent loss diaphragm activity follow hyperventilation . Memory prior activation diaphragm well document past appear defective patient . There extensive research method improve neural memory . Cycloserine , antibiotic , continue , use extensively treatment drug-resistant tuberculosis , show effective promote memory small dos ( much less used tuberculosis ) animal human . We , therefore , propose cycloserine potential enhance memory property neurones supply pharyngeal muscle propose study effect use severity sleep apneas obstructive central variety . Patients diagnose OSA follow routine clinical sleep study ask participate . Participation involve agree two additional full night study sleep laboratory , separate 1 week . Both study identical routine clinical study , except patient ask swallow capsule contain either placebo 250 mg cycloserine 1 2 hour prior go sleep . The order Placebo Test night randomize . The patient monitor continuously dedicate , senior polysomnography technologist .</detailed_description>
