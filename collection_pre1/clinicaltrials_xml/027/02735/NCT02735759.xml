	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate adjust photoacoustic flow cytometry device use detect circulate embolus . Study Design : Cohort 1 : Normal healthy volunteer enrol adjust device setting . Cohort 2 : Use Phatoacoustic flow cytometry ( PAFC ) detect circulate embolus vivo patient venous thromboembolism diagnosis , anticoagulation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laser beam investigational device Phatoacoustic flow cytometry PAFC apply skin underlying blood vessel . The optical ultrasound signal collect analysis . On tested vessel , estimate vessel diameter ( use optical or/and ultrasound image ) . The subject 's skin pigmentation classify light , medium , dark . A photoacoustic ( PA ) contrast consider usable detection circulate emboli photoacoustic signal vessel 1.3-fold high photoacoustic signal surround tissue . The device subject enrol cohort 2 complete day 0 ( immediately venous thromboembolism diagnosis prior anticoagulation therapy ) , day 7 ± 3 day initiation anticoagulation therapy , one week ± 3 day completion plan anticoagulation therapy one month ± 3 day completion plan anticoagulation therapy . Anticoagulation therapy part patient 's normal standard care part study however data therapy receive may capture . D-dimer test perform time point part normal standard care however D-dimer test order part standard care require study.. Patients follow hematology clinic monitor venous thromboembolism recurrence every 3 month one year .</detailed_description>
