	<brief_summary>Stroke one common cause acquired adult disability . The majority stroke survivor mobility difficulty poor standing , decrease walk speed , balance disturbance , increase risk fall . Improving mobility , functional walking balance main goal stroke rehabilitation . Robotic technology become promise intervention locomotor train stroke rehabilitation . Static dynamic balance deficit act crucial role gait performance among stroke survivor . Therefore important determine effect BWSTT improve balance person stroke . Although demonstrated BWSTT improve balance gait performance stroke patient , clear whether improvement great compare associated gait rehabilitation method . To investigator knowledge , also limited study literature concern effect BWSTT fall risk stroke patient . The strong evidence need effectiveness BWSTT include comprehensive determinant balance combine isolated intervention groups.This study aim compare effect BWSTT combine isolated intervention balance , gait fall risk patient subacute chronic stroke . The investigator hypotheses stroke : 1. combination BWSTT conventional training may lead improved balance parameter ; 2. apply isolate intervention , BWSTT conventional training may lead similar result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants : All participant stroke recruited government rehabilitation hospital November 2014 November 2015 . All treatment perform hospital . Sample Size : `` Power Sample Size Program '' use calculate sample size . It determine consider previous study calculate minimal detectable change Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) stroke patient ( 20 ) . According study response within subject group normally distribute standard deviation 7.87 minimal detectable change find 10 % BBS . It calculate 15 participant need group probability ( power ) 0.8 0.016 alpha level compute Bonferroni adjustment . Procedure : One hundred seven stroke patient assess eligibility two physiatrists ( B.E B.G ) . Forty-two ( 13 woman , range age : 18-75 year ) patient find suitable inclusion criterion study . Randomisation perform use randomisation function Microsoft Office Excel programme another researcher ( ARO ) . Random number generator Microsoft Office Excel Software give random number 0 1 treatment column create ARO . Sorting random number row large small number perform sort filter menu . Treatment assignment stratify accord severity impairment baseline study site ensure balance distribution among three groups.After randomisation , assessment baseline train perform two physiotherapist blind intervention ( IY , BEH ) . All participant treat rehabilitation hospital physiotherapist experience stroke rehabilitation . BWSTT Training perform RM .</detailed_description>
