	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery consider effective long-term intervention treatment obesity associate complication . While bariatric surgery show result large sustain weight loss , degree weight loss maintenance thereafter vary greatly . The Heads Up Surgical Demonstration Project ( Heads Up ) 5 year project examine weight loss intensive medical intervention ( IMI ) 2 widely use bariatric surgery ( roux-en-y gastric bypass RYGB sleeve gastrectomy SG ) . Baseline data collect prior surgery follow-up data collect 6 month annually thereafter . A recent meta-analysis reveal RYGB result great weight loss effective resolve obesity relate comorbidities SG , although SG show result reduction perioperative complication reoperations1 . Full elucidation mechanism lead variation success weight loss intervention crucial understanding effective reliable treatment obesity associate comorbidities .</brief_summary>
