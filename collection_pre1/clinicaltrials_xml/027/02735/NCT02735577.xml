	<brief_summary>This study combine functional MRI medication treatment order understand neural mechanism disulfiram , currently approve medication alcohol use disorder , change behavior . Disulfiram medication prevents drink cause highly unpleasant physical reaction alcohol consume take . Thus , provide mean study general neural mechanism awareness risk impact behavior change alcohol use disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neural Mechanisms Disulfiram Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal project combine functional brain image clinical method order examine treatment disulfiram ( DIS ) alter neural activity relate alcohol-seeking motivation patient alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . DIS establish , effective , FDA-approved medication AUD cause highly aversive physical reaction alcohol consume take . The mere awareness risk threat DIS-alcohol reaction deters alcohol use , i.e . necessary drink alcohol take DIS change behavior . By uncover neural mechanism underlie risk/threat-based psychological effect , possible integrate DIS biologically base treatment targeted neural mechanism , goal improve efficacy DIS . Furthermore , result shed light general neural mechanism awareness risk substance use impact addictive motivation . This core process number behavioral treatment substance use disorder , Motivational Interviewing Contingency Management , well behavior change non-treatment setting .</detailed_description>
