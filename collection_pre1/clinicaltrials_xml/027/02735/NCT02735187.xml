	<brief_summary>Patients screen 28 day start treatment . During screen visit , purpose procedure study explain potential patient informed consent obtain . At baseline visit , inclusion exclusion criterion re-assessed . Eligible patient randomize treatment target area either 30 minute ( group30 ) 15 minute ( group15 ) blue light 600 mW/cm² . Additionally , two study area similar clinical symptomatology determine randomized blue light treat area Daivonex treat area . After randomization , patient train demonstrator device ( actual treatment ensure investigator blind group patient randomize ) well Daivonex cream . After patient instructed , treatment area apply daily ( per day , 5-7 time / week ) home treatment period 12 week . During 12 week , patient return study site safety effectiveness assessment week 2 , 4 , 8 week 12 . A phone call visit perform one week treatment check adverse event problem handle device cream .
