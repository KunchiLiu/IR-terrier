	<brief_summary>This clinical study seek address four independent question part delivery care associate provision single item treatment ; indirect restoration ( know 'crown ' ) restore cover damage tooth . The provision crown require series sequential clinical laboratory stage stage : 1 . Stage 1 - Preliminary impression . Taking pre-operative impression tooth crown . This use enable fabrication temporary crown tooth prepare . This standard care follow establish clinical protocol . 2 . Stage 2 - Preparation tooth . This involve cut tooth back make space crown fabricate replace missing structure . 3 . Stage 3 - Taking impression prepare tooth . From duplicate model make fabricate crown . To take impression , dentist need gently push gum away tooth fraction millimeter margin preparation clearly discernible . 4 . Stage 4 - Provision temporary restoration provide satisfactory function limit period time , definitive crown fit . This temporary crown design finite short-term durability ease manufacture subsequent removal ; hence use specific cement enable . 5 . Stage 5 - Fitting definitive restoration . This design durable restoration , mean life expectancy measured year , ultimately determine number clinical , biological patient specific parameter . Definitive restoration fit cement design retain crown permanent manner .</brief_summary>
