	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) one common malignance South China . Radiation therapy remain principal treatment NPC . The frequently occur radiation-related side effect probably radiation-induced oral mucositis ( OM ) , affect 100 % NPC patient receive radiation therapy . Although intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) widely use China nowadays , incidence radiation-induced oral mucositis still high . OM decrease patient ' oral intake nutrition , lead dehydration , weight loss , decline performance status may require intravenous fluid hydration , feed tube placement , hospitalization . OM also may increase opioid use . When severe , oral mucositis increase risk infection may compromise clinical outcome necessitate treatment break , dosage reduction , reduce therapy compliance . Common clinical management strategy include bland rinse , topical anesthetic analgesic , mucosal coat agent , systemic analgesic . However , none intervention support conclusive evidence . In China , quadruple mixture , compose dexamethasone , gentamicin , vitamin B12 , procaine , commonly prescribe NPC patient begin suffer radiation-induced OM . Oral Ulcer Gargle ( FORRAD® ) proprietary viscous liquid mucoadhesive hydrogel formulation . It create palliative barrier injure mucosa , prevent cure radiation-induced OM . The objective randomized phase II study ass efficacy safety Oral Ulcer Gargle ( FORRAD® ) intervention radiation-induced OM treatment NPC , compare commonly use quadruple mixture , compose dexamethasone , gentamicin , vitamin B12 , procaine .</detailed_description>
