	<brief_summary>The trial detect mRNA expression several bone repair-related gene , include Runx2 , femoral head neck patient osteonecrosis femoral head ( ONFH ) . Runx2 expression compare identical tissue osteoarthritis patient identify expression necrotic femoral head tissue , help clarify role possible clinical significance Runx2 femoral head necrosis , bone repair reconstruction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteonecrosis femoral head ( ONFH ) destructive degenerative disease develop subchondral articular facet cartilage collapse . Among proposed pathological mechanism underlie ONFH , much attention pay theory increase intraosseous pressure . The core theory unbalance osteoblast adipocyte differentiation bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell ( BM-MSCs ) . The occurrence development osteonecrosis relate abnormal metabolism differentiation BM-MSCs . Normal adult BM-MSCs differentiate adipocytes osteoblasts maintain normal physical status . In response exogenous stimulus ( example , use exogenous hormone alcohol ) , bone marrow microenvironment change allow BM-MSCs differentiate adipocytes , lead increase bone marrow cavity pressure , thereby induce ischemic ONFH . Overexpression Runx2 , osteoblast-specific transcription factor , increase osteoblast differentiation BM-MSCs , thereby strengthen effect BM-MSC transplantation repair bone defect necrosis . By control expression osteocalcin , osteoblast-specific gene , Runx2 also control osteoblast differentiation functioning . Osteocalcin , common indicator use evaluate bone formation conversion rate , bone metabolism-regulating factor generate secreted osteoblast ; thus , consider good marker bone functioning . In previous study Chen et al. , seven patient glucocorticoid-induced ONFH Association Research Circulation Osseous ( ARCO ) Stage IV include experimental group seven patient femoral neck fracture serve control group . Immunohistochemical stain quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) use detect osteocalcin immunoreactivity Runx2 expression femoral head neck tissue . They find glucocorticoid-induced ONFH likely closely related osteocalcin . ONFH result interruption blood supply femoral head injury-caused death chondrocytes bone marrow component . During subsequent repair process , bone morphogenetic protein ( BMPs ) stimulate BM-MSCs differentiate osteoblast , also promote osteoblast growth ; BMP-2 key factor regulate bone tissue formation . Sclerotin loss ONFH closely related unbalance osteoclast activity differentiation . Osteoprotegerin inhibit bone absorption mature osteoblasts induce apoptosis osteoblast . Osteoprotegerin ligand system confirm key factor regulate osteoblast formation differentiation , bone absorption play important role pathogenesis treatment osteoporosis , osteoarthritis bone tumor . To best knowledge , control clinical trial examine BMP , osteocalcin , osteoprotegerin , particular , Runx2 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression femoral head tissue patient ONFH Ficat Stage III-IV osteoarthritis . In non-randomized , parallel-controlled trial , use real-time PCR ( RT-PCR ) detect Runx2 , BMP-2 , BMP-7 osteoprotegerin mRNA expression femoral head tissue patient ONFH Ficat Stage III-IV . Simultaneously , detect osteocalcin immunoreactivity use immunohistochemical staining method , compare osteoarthritis patient purpose clarify mechanism factor bone reconstruction post-ONFH . Data collection , management , analysis open access Data collection : According trial design , table formulate data collection . Collected data input electronic database professional staff use double-data entry strategy . Data management : Information accuracy check recruited patient follow . The database lock researcher charge alter . All information relate trial preserve Shengjing Hospital China Medical University , China . Data analysis : The electronic database fully disclose professional statistician statistical analysis . Data open access : Published data available www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform professional statistician ( blinded grouping ) use SPSS 19.0 software . If Runx2 , BMP-2 , BMP-7 osteoprotegerin mRNA expression , well osteocalcin immunoreactivity femoral head neck patient ONFH osteoarthritis , normally distribute , two-sample t-test use compare difference group . If , however , data normally distribute , Mann-Whitney U test use . A level P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
