	<brief_summary>The propose trial pilot test smartphone application ( app ) ultimately allow patient take transmit photo postoperative wound home relay symptom information . This protocol cover single-institution pilot study app 's use period hospital discharge patient 's first follow-up clinic visit . The investigator recruit vascular surgery patient either preoperatively clinic post-operative , pre-discharge period follow surgery participate pilot . Using train protocol refine usability-testing phase project , patient train use smartphone wound surveillance app prior discharge . Patients use app home take send digital image postoperative wound answer short survey , transmitted secure database maintain University Wisconsin ( UW ) Department Surgery accessible UW-employed study personnel . These data evaluate one three vascular surgery service nurse practitioner ( NPs ) daily enter medical record . Patients concern finding either image survey answer contact evaluation . Smartphones provide patient one , partnership AT &amp; T . Sociodemographic comorbidity data collect medical record keep UW Department Surgery secure server accessible UW employ study personnel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial Postoperative Wound Surveillance Using Smartphones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study duration : 3 year Population Description : Patients typically old adult multiple comorbid condition low health literacy . Caregivers may similar profile may younger technological experience ( adult son daughter ) . Recruitment Consent Screening eligibility : On outpatient side , study personnel identify eligible participant vascular surgery clinic schedule . On inpatient side , study personnel identify eligible participant service inpatient assistance service NPs resident . Eligible patient approach study personnel operate surgeon service NP discus project obtain consent . Enrollment/baseline : Research personnel introduce study , obtain consent , perform train teach patient caregiver take picture wound . A write consent obtain thorough discussion study . All information explain non-technical fashion . Time provide answer patient caregiver question concern study . Patients caregiver also warn risk breach confidentiality , measure take try prevent , also do instance may happen . Study Activities Subject identification recruitment : Study personnel clinical access identify eligible participant medical record . Data element collect medical record follow consent : age , sex , type surgery , date surgery , surgical complication , zip code ( determine rural/urban status 4G coverage ) , comorbidities ( particularly cognitive impairment motor function impairment ) . Treatment/intervention period : Regardless patient recruit consented , patient and/or caregiver train use app post-operative , predischarge period ; additional training provide use device , necessary . Notes take document success training identify potential area improvement training protocol . The study personnel explain protocol patient discharge home answer question patient and/or caregiver may . Participants provide iPhone 5 , keep follow study completion . Prior assign smartphone participant , study personnel guide process reset device erase information store prior user . Participants ' name medical record number encrypt stored backend app never place device . When patient discharge hospital , ask take photograph surgical wound answer short survey wound general recovery use smartphone app . This information transmit via encrypted connection secure research server UW Department Surgery . A composite screen create display transmit image well response survey question within app . Each afternoon , service NP study personnel MD surgical training review data transmit complete short form document appearance surgical wound . Within review screen , reviewer mark data already review , move record archive list . This form scan patient 's medical record new evidence burgeon complication ; image remain department server associate medical record . Any concerning finding prompt phone call surgical service nurse practitioner ( NP ) patient gather information recommend additional intervention/treatment indicate , may include antibiotic clinic visit ; upon detection burgeon complication , usual care clinical protocol take ( patient call concern ) . Additionally , contact information vascular surgery clinic study personnel provide 2 point app , patient caregiver easily call question concern . If patient submit information past 24 hour , study personnel call patient discus protocol difficulty may complete . The phone call punitive , aim decrease study attrition , identify reason patient compliant state protocol , identify possible measure improve protocol . Three attempt make contact individual patient . All patient receive call 5-6 day follow discharge ass use app regardless attrition status . Specific Aims/Study Objectives : Goal : Evaluate effectiveness feasibility protocol post-discharge wound monitoring use smartphone app ability detect postoperative wound complication reduce hospital readmission vascular surgery patient population.. Hypotheses test : H 1 : With well-designed app train module , patient empower opportunity participate postoperative care prevent potentially life threaten wound complication . H 2 : Through use smartphone app post-discharge period , wound complication detect earlier would otherwise need hospital readmission decrease . Device Information App description : Screen shot upload supplementary content . No information photo retain phone . UW Department Surgery IT , entity develop app , ensure app HIPAA-compliant . Neither photo generate study associate information store directly phone 's camera role . Device specification , packaging , labeling : Smartphones iPhone 5 6 purchased collaboration AT &amp; T . 1 . Device iOS device run iOS 8 high . A pas code use secure encrypt device . Devices maintain use Apple Profile Manager allow remote-wiping device , prevent install additional apps , limit device feature . The Wound App ( mobile application ) instal Apple Profile Manager . The Wound app save protect health information permanent storage device . Photos responses hold application memory submit back Department Surgery web server . If user idle 10 minute app time . Photos responses release memory submit app time .</detailed_description>
