	<brief_summary>Effective tuberculosis ( TB ) control require people progress latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) infection ( LTBI ) TB disease identify treated infect others . A prognostic correlate risk ( COR ) , base messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression signature , prospectively discriminate TB case healthy control , construct validate . Based published microarray case-control datasets , COR 87 % diagnostic sensitivity 97 % specificity prevalent TB disease ; two nest case-control study , 70 % prognostic sensitivity 84 % specificity incident TB disease occur within one year sampling ( HIV uninfected person ) . Diagnostic prognostic performance COR yet test prospective cohort . COR+ status directly associate LTBI ; may , may , amenable preventive therapy . Although effective short-term , preventive therapy recommend treatment LTBI HIV uninfected adult live high TB burden country , due rapid loss protection ; treatment burden . A 3-month , 12-dose , once-weekly preventive therapy regimen high dose Isoniazid ( INH ) Rifapentine ( 3HP ) recommend equivalent 6 month daily INH treatment LTBI low TB burden country World Health Organization ( WHO ) . A 'screen &amp; treat ' strategy , base serial mass campaign provide target , short-course preventive therapy COR+ person high risk TB disease , may offer solution durable , community-wide protection high TB burden country . The efficacy 3HP prevention incident TB disease COR+ person yet test clinical trial . Primary Aims 1 . Test whether preventive therapy ( 3HP ) reduces rate incident TB disease , compare standard care ( active surveillance ) , COR+ person . 2 . Test whether COR status differentiate person cumulative prevalent incident TB disease person without TB disease . Secondary Aims 1 . Estimate whether COR status differentiate person high risk incident TB disease person low risk incident TB disease 2 . Compare prognostic performance COR incident TB disease Interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA ) .</brief_summary>
