	<brief_summary>Virtual reality balance training already use stroke rehabilitation , previous study support could improve balance ability . Although treatment effect support study , still limitations clinical intervention study power enough . Study use Kinect Xbox game balance intervention . Investigators recruit 60 patient chronic stroke Shung-ho hospital clinical rehabilitation randomly assign participant `` standard treatment plus virtual reality group '' ( N=30 ) `` standard treatment group '' ( N=30 ) . There total 12 session ( 2 time weekly ) group . Investigators assess subject ' ability 3 time ( pre- post-intervention , follow post 3 month ) .Investigators also record pleasure scale adverse event every training session . Hypothesis Kinect Xbox intervention significantly improve subject ' balance ability , confidence balance , ADL , QOL compare conventional rehabilitation . It may help develop new clinical model virtual reality training patient chronic stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Effects Balance With Kinect Xbox Virtual Reality Games</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many stroke survivor suffer postural balance problem . Decreased mobility limit daily life activity . Virtual reality balance training already use stroke rehabilitation , previous study support could improve balance ability . The mechanism multi-sensory feedback repeat practice could facilitate motor learn brain neuroplasticity . Compared conventional rehabilitation , VR rehabilitation could increase subject ' motivation pleasure . Although treatment effect support study , still limitations clinical intervention study power enough . The study use Kinect Xbox game balance intervention . Kinect Xbox n't need additional controller hold subject detect movement real time give subject visual auditory feedback immediately . Investigators recruit 60 patient chronic stroke Shung-ho hospital clinical rehabilitation randomly assign `` standard treatment plus virtual reality group '' ( N=30 ) `` standard treatment group '' ( N=30 ) . There total 12 session ( 2 time weekly ) group . Investigators assess subject ' ability 3 time ( pre- post-intervention , follow post 3 month ) . The outcome measure include Force plate , Functional reach test , Berg Balance Scale , Time go balance evaluation , Modified barthel index ADL ability , Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale balance confidence , Stroke Impact Scale quality life . Investigators also record pleasure scale adverse event every training session . Collected data analyze repeated measure 2-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , Turkey test post hoc independent T sample test . Hypothesis Kinect Xbox intervention significantly improve subject ' balance ability , confidence balance , ADL , QOL compare conventional rehabilitation . It may help develop new clinical model virtual reality training patient chronic stroke .</detailed_description>
