	<detailed_description>In study , investigator aim build infrastructure rapidly obtain evidence management patient require admission ICU pandemic severe respiratory infection . Furthermore , inter-pandemic phase , infrastructure consist roll adaptive clinical trial evaluate different management strategy patient severe CAP admit ICU . This ongoing trial serve framework different aspect ICU patient management rigorously rapidly evaluate rapid modification ( adaptation ) trial intervention base new circumstance ( e.g. , pandemic ) . These modification adaptation may include add `` pandemic '' study arm ( without predefined treatment ) change randomization scheme .</detailed_description>
