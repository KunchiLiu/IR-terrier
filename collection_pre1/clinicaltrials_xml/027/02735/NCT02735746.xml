	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare lung function data generate apply High Fidelity Functional Lung Imaging ( HFFLI ) software 4D CT , cone beam CT , fluoroscopic image lung breathe determine whether different modality image provide similar data lung movement function . HFFLI may detect change lung function patient undergoing External Beam Radiotherapy cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Lung Imaging Adults Undergoing Radiation Therapy Assess Radiation Pneumonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design test novel technology examine early change lung hope identify patient may risk radiation pneumonitis . Eligible subject undergo standard care treatment use Varian TrueBeam system radiation therapy cancer lesion chest . The image data acquire part usual standard care patient pre-treatment 4D planning CT scan , daily cone beam CT radiation treatment visit . We also obtain series image consist five six-second cinefluorographs ( real time fluoroscopic movie , total time 30 second fluoroscopy ) lung subject breathing , precisely measure angle subject , 4 different occasion . This study compare lung function data generate apply High Fidelity Functional Lung Imaging ( HFFLI ) software 4D CT , cone beam CT , fluoroscopic image lung breathe determine degree correlation data generate different image modality . The study open adult age 18 , stage cancer .</detailed_description>
