	<brief_summary>By Investigating heart rate variability ( HRV ) 15 patient stroke compare HRV 15 orthopedic patient , investigator hope achieve 3 main goal : 1 . To describe 24-hour circadian rhythm heart rate among patient stroke sub-acute phase 3 day . 2 . To examine difference circadian rhythm heart rate along 3 day patient stroke sub-acute phase control group match age gender . 3 . To describe reaction examine difference reaction heart autonomic system rest , pace breathing activity groups- stoke control . The HRV monitor Polar watch activity measure accelerometer , attached patient begin trial stay 3 whole day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Behavior Cardiac Autonomic Regulation System During 24h Patient Post Stroke Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Evaluating autonomic system conducting , among others , compare relationship two sub-systems assembler : sympathetic parasympathetic system . In normal condition , balance system reflect highly dynamic heart rate heart rate variability . As part brain injury stroke , autonomic system also damage . The heart rate variability decrease 24-hour circadian rhythm heart rate change . Purposes research : 1 . To describe 24-hour circadian rhythm heart rate among patient stroke sub-acute phase 3 day . 2 . To examine difference circadian rhythm heart rate along 3 day patient stroke sub-acute phase control group match age gender . 3 . To describe reaction examine difference reaction heart autonomic system rest , pace breathing activity groups- stoke control . Methods : Population : 15 patient cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , 1-3 week stroke . The patient hospitalize neurology department geriatric `` Beit-Rivka '' hospital . The control group 15 patient orthopedic department hospital ' matching age gender . Tools : monitoring heart rate heart rate variability Polar watch ( Polar RS800CX heart rate monitor ) . Monitoring activity measure accelerometer . Methods : attach RS800CX watch , participant complete two test : response heart rate deep breathing response heart rate variability prolong hand grip . The department nurse ask answer questionnaire regard autonomic function examiner asses functional independence participant `` Functional Independence Measure '' ( FIM ) . In research group additional assessment regard motor function `` Stroke Activity Scale '' `` Scandinavian Stroke Scale '' . The watch accelerometer stay participant 3 day ( 72 hour ) record regard daily activity meal , sleep , kind treatment take department 's diary . At end three day , data collect analyzed computer software .</detailed_description>
