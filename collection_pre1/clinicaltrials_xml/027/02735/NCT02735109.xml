	<detailed_description>The squamous cell carcinoma common cancer vulva ( 90-95 % ) , prognosis depend stage . The management vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia ( VIN ) secondary prevention squamous cell carcinoma vulva . Conventional VIN strongly associate infection oncogenic HPV ( human papillomavirus ) , present risk malignant degeneration order 9-15 % . Whereas differentiate VIN , rarer often see context lichen sclerosis high risk malignant degeneration range 40 50 % . The diagnosis histological , biopsy realization currently gold standard start cure . However , biopsy vulva harmless act patient , often repeat due extensive damage . The early management lesion VIN avoids change squamous cell carcinoma . Over diagnosed early , good care specific treatment allocate . The confocal microscope new image technology , already widely use examination skin mucous membrane . This noninvasive imaging technique provide high-resolution image depth 250 micron , `` optical '' cut three dimension thickness skin . The device use study VivaScope 3000 . The advantage confocal microscope discriminate benign malignant lesion skin oral mucosa show several prospective study . Two recent study highlight promising result use confocal microscope pigment vulvar lesion ( melanosis / melanoma ) . There currently data literature impact technique VIN vulvar epidermoid carcinoma . This single-center prospective descriptive study University Hospital Nice gynecology dermatology , prove contribution confocal microscope vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia ( VIN ) vulvar epidermoid carcinoma . The aim study describe characteristic reproducibly confocal microscope normal vulvar mucosa lesion VIN , vulvar squamous carcinoma . The patient see consultation obstetrics gynecology department / dermatology bow vulvar lesion suspicious look include study signing inform consent . The result compare systematically histological result biopsy lesion ( gold standard ) . The investigator expect study validation confocal microscope noninvasive diagnostic tool suspicious vulvar lesion ( reduction repeat biopsy , target biopsy monitor certain lesion , even reduce health cost inherent unnecessary biopsy ) ... .</detailed_description>
