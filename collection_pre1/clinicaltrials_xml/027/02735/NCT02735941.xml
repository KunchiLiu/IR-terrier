	<detailed_description>Expression cannabinoid receptor examine mucosal biopsy colon blood leukocyte patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) colon cancer comparison healthy individual polymerase chain reaction , Western Blots flow cytometry . Colonic endoscopic biopsy blood collect adult patient confirm active Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , adult UC CD patient remission , colon cancer patient healthy individual ( control ) . Biopsies healthy individual ( control group ) undergone colonoscopy standard screen colorectal cancer diagnostic workup gastrointestinal symptom without endoscopic histologic evidence colonic disease . For UC patient , duration location disease ( Montreal classification ) , endoscopic ( Mayo score ) clinical activity score , histological feature current previous treatment ( 5-aminosalicylic acid , corticosteroid , immunomodulators ) record . For CD patient , duration location disease assess , HarveyBradshaw Index activity score , histological feature current previous treatment record . Blood collect immediately process flow cytometric experiment . Phospholipids measure serum colonic mucosal biopsy sample cohort mass spectrometry .</detailed_description>
