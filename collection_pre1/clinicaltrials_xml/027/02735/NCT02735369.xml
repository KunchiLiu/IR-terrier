	<brief_summary>The present study intend evaluate efficacy safety topical OC-10X Ophthalmic Suspension patient diagnose proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( level 61 , 65 , 71 , 75 ) . OcuCure Therapeutics , Inc. ( Roanoke , VA ) develop lead compound , know OC-10X , selective tubulin inhibitor development treatment Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( PDR ) Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . When administered topical eye drop , OC-10X anti-angiogenic ( inhibition ) angiolytic ( regression ) property animal model choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . Unlike therapy , OC-10X provide efficacy vascular target agent without traditional toxicity work downstream independently growth factor . As demonstrated OcuCure 's preclinical data , tubulin inhibition , use OC-10X , may promise new approach treatment PDR AMD . Like AMD , PDR major cause blindness adult also cause growth abnormal blood vessel . Importantly , Phase I Study find OC-10X safely apply topically human eye without adverse ocular systemic effect . Currently , option treatment PDR . Clinical option , laser photocoagulation vitrectomy , require surgery permanently impair patient ' vision . With treatment option available , administration OC-10X topical therapy , along novel mechanism , potential provide benefit patient ocular disease associate angiogenesis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient diagnose Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy eligible follow inclusion criterion meet : 1 . Ability provide approve write informed consent complies studyrelated procedures/assessments full duration study , age â‰¥18 year . 2 . Type 1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus . 3 . Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( level 61 , 65 , 71 , 75 ) one eye without evidence significant vitreous/pre retinal hemorrhage would limit photographic documentation area neovascularization without preretinal fibrosis . If eyes meet eligibility requirement , less affected eye select receive investigational drug placebo . The second eye treat standard care . ( e.g . panretinal laser photocoagulation ) . 4 . BestCorrected Visual acuity 20/200 good eye . 5 . If female : Of childbearing potential , agree use acceptable method birth control judge Investigator ( ) , condom , foam , jelly , diaphragm , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , duration study least 2 week follow final dose study drug abstinence ; Is postmenopausal least 1 year ; Is surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy ) . Is pregnant breastfeed . Male female patient diagnose Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy eligible study exclusion criterion meet : 1 . Clinically significant systemic diseases/conditions , opinion Investigator , could negatively affect safety patient study determine case case basis ( e.g. , unstable medical status include uncontrolled blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled liver disease , glycemic control significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant , hepatic , pulmonary , gastrointestinal neurological disease , cancer BMI ) . 2 . Participation clinical study/trial within past 30 day prior randomization . 3 . Current treatment active systemic infection . 4 . Known allergy component formulation topical anesthetic ( e.g. , benzalkonium chloride , fluorescein , etc. ) . 5 . History psychiatric illness , may impair ability provide write informed consent . 6 . Presence disease marker HIV 1 2 , Hepatitis B C viruses syphilis infection . 7 . Positive urinary screen test drug abuse ( opiate , cannabinoids , amphetamine , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , cocaine ) . 8 . History drug dependence excessive alcohol intake habitual basis 2 unit alcoholic beverage per day ( 1 unit equivalent half pint beer 1 glass wine 1 measure spirit ) difficulty abstain duration study period . 9 . Use antimitotic antimetabolite therapy within 2 month enrollment . 10 . Planned use ocular systemic medication Investigator determine unacceptable study ( i.e . antivascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] therapy ) , exception oral contraceptive shortterm use overthecounter analgesic study . 11 . Any concurrent condition , opinion Investigator , would prevent completion clinical trial , include inability comply study requirement . 12 . Presence significant fibrosis gliosis neovascularization disc retina . 13 . Presence tractional retinal detachment . 14 . History panretinal laser photocoagulation ( PRP ) Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy . 15 . Patients likely require treatment diabetic macular edema study . 16 . Any intraocular surgery trauma within 6 month trial enrollment . 17 . History chronic ocular disease , opinion Investigator , affect neovascular progression . 18 . Myocardial infarction , cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment congestive heart failure within 6 month prior randomization , opinion Investigator , could negatively affect safety patient study . 19 . Current use contact lenses . 20 . Concurrent anticipate use ocular agent study period consider Investigator interfere study objective . 21 . History evidence ocular infection , inflammation , blepharitis , conjunctivitis within 2 month ; history herpes simplex keratitis . 22 . An ocular condition present ( diabetes ) , opinion Investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , IrvineGass Syndrome , etc. ) . 23 . Substantial cataract , In opinion Investigator , likely cause decrease visual acuity 3 line ( e.g.. , cataract reduce acuity 20/40 worse ) . Would interfere photography retina . 24 . Aphakia , uncontrolled glaucoma ( Investigator 's judgment ) . 25 . Inability tolerate eye drop eye eye drop correctly administer .</criteria>
