Data Collection Before study begin medical history perform determine factor relevant study pre- post-training , procedure perform involve number step involve : - Determination Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) ; - Body Composition ( DC ) : regional total body analysis examine DXA HCFMRP-USP ; - Anthropometric measurement ( weight , height , skinfold thickness , perimeter bone diameter ) ; - biochemical test - evaluate immunological metabolic parameter ; - Food Recall . Index Ankle / Brachial ( ITB ) The ABI calculate ratio systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) posterior tibial artery dorsalis pedis artery high SBP brachial radial artery ( calculate hemisphere ) . With patient position supine implementation measure . The PAS region determine mean aneroid sphygmomanometer brand `` Premium® '' Doppler Vascular Portable - DV 600 , brand `` Martec Med® . '' Body Composition The CC molecular levelwill determine scan Total Body Regional DXA ( Hologic® , QDR4500W software , version 11.2 QDR ) , determine : bone mineral content ( BMC ) , mass fat ( MG ) MG percentage ( % BF ) lean soft tissue ( TMM ) . The portion component consider five regional site : upper ( Sup ) , low ( Inf ) , appendicular ( Ape , Sup + Inf ) , trunk ( Tro ) total ( Tot ) . Prior DXA participant ask empty bladder wear one hospital gown . During examination position centrally supine scanner table , outstretched legs háluces contact ; upper body must remain extended along trunk hand contact trunk important patient stay still procedure . Whereas BMC measure DXA bone ash bone mass ( MO ) full , approximately 95.82 % , total amount correct multiply 1.0436 BMC . As noted although significant difference estimate BMC DXA commercial system , aspect minimum impact estimate multicomponent CC . Subsequently overall change fat , bone muscle tissue perform process level 2 DC component ( molecular ) level 4 ( organ / tissue ) accord propose muscle tissue bone tissue adipose tissue , show Table 1 : Table 1 - Equations transform molecular level DC component level organ / tissue . Magazine mass Model ( kg ) Skeletal Muscle TMM appendage ( kg ) x *1,19-1,65 Bone 1.85 x MO Adipose Tissue 1.18 x Fat Mass Body mass determine DXA use future comparison . 3.5.3 Evaluation anthropometric Body weight height determine electronic scale stadiometer brand `` Welmy® '' feature read scale accurate reading 0.1 kg 0.5 cm body weight height , respectively . Skinfolds , perimeters bone diameter determine caliper , anthropometric tape caliper 0.1 mm reading accuracy , 0.1 cm 0.1 mm , respectively , brand `` Sanny Medical® '' . All anthropometric measurement carry accord literature recommendation . Biochemical test A blood sample collect routine consultation Metabolic Immune analysis Viral Load Laboratory - Serology Sector HCFMRP-USP . The concentration total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , insulin fast blood glucose determine enzymatic method use kit Wiener Lab.® . For immune response viral load level , detectable HIV RNA &gt; 48 cópias.mL-1 . Is determined Real Time Abbott method use kit Siemens - Versant® HIV-1 3.0 RNA DNA Analyzer System 340® apparatus ; CD4 + CD8 count flow cytometry , use Multitest® kit Facs Calibur® cytometer ( Becton Dickinson - San Jose CA ) . To analyze insulin resistance patient , use homeostasis index model assessment - resistence insulin ( HOMA-IR ) , calculate fast glucose formula ( mmol / l = mg / dl ÷ 18 ) x fast insulin ( U / ml ) / 22.5 . The anthropometric assessment , determination ABI examination DXA take place HC-FMRP / USP , single session , least assessor train role . Laboratory test perform HC-FMRP / USP , morning , patient fast eight hour , skilled professional routine outpatient follow-up UETDI HCFMRP-USP . Protocols Strength Training ( TF ) Overview Protocol Patients divide three group , TF group form sample mirror power level : - G1 - TFOV ( n≈12 ; intensity TF : 30 % 1RM ) . The vascular occlusion pressure member determine individually posterior tibial artery brachial radial ( compute hemisphere ) vascular Doppler - DV 600 , mark `` Martec Med '' , patient position supine use restrictive cuff restriction blood flow brand `` Missouri® '' ( Lower limb : 170X900 mm ; Upper limb : 70X730 mm - drive cuff ) . - G2 - TFT ( n≈12 ; TF intensity : 80 % 1RM ; vascular occlusion ) , ; - G3 - Subject untrained , control group ( n≈12 ) . Individuals G1 G2 undergo 12 week TF , total 36 session , weekly frequency three time , first two week adaptation TF . Before train session hold measurement blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) oxygen saturation blood ( SpO2 ) , use stethoscope aneroid sphygmomanometer brand `` Premium® '' cardiofrequency brand `` Polar FT7® `` digital oximeter brand '' Oximeter® `` . In absence vital sign indicative , begin train protocol . Exercises follow : 10 minute heat , completion five minute stationary bike set 15 repetition exercise heat approximately 50 % 1RM . Thirty minute exercise : elbow extension pulley ( triceps ) ; Barbell curl ( biceps ) ; Unilateral knee flexion ( hamstring ) flexor stand ; Knee extension ( quadriceps ) extensor chair , use exercise machine station `` Athletic 2000® Extreme '' ( Full Station ) , brand `` Atletic Way® '' ( Porto Alegre - RS ) ( intensity variation 2 , 5 270 kg independent column ) ; five minute cool muscle relaxation . Intensity Volume The exercise distribute two consecutive phase : Phase Specific Adaptation Phase Adaptation phase ( compose six session group ) : - For group 1 2 , offer five training session three set 12 15 repetition intensity 50 % maximal work capacity ( 1RM ) , certain pre indirectly Adapting Stage mean maximum repetition test ( RMs ) . At stage , concern respect learn movement speed execution ( two-second interval concentric phase two second eccentric phase ) . To proper adaptation patient exercise . - In 6th training session give intensity 1RM RMs test ( Brzycki , 1993 ) , see change maximum force adaptation phase determine training intensity Specific Phase . This procedure repeat 15th session specific period adjust intensity 30th session verify change maximum force end intervention period . Specific phase ( consist 30 session group ) : - G1 : first week ( three session ) three set 10 repetition adaptation occlusion pressure , three session repetition concentric failure , two-second interval concentric phase two second eccentric phase , 30 % 1RM intermittent vascular occlusion member ( occlusion use course series , release blood flow break ) . Will provide one-minute interval set exercise ( exception interval exercise upper low ; provide present three-minute break removal installation restrictive cuff ) . - G2 : three series repetition concentric failure , cadence movement interval similar G1 . The intensity 80 % 1RM without occlusion . - The G3 attend TF , consider control group , take part pre post intervention assessment . In order increase security type training , HR BP patient monitor throughout train session period ( exercises series ) . The FC monitor heart rate monitor brand `` Polar FT7® place train session PA stethoscope aneroid sphygmomanometer brand '' Premium® `` place end series . As PA give 20 30 second completion last rep. Before physiological disorder complaint , training stop necessary precaution measure take . Statistical Analysis An exploratory analysis use check behavior data normality test ( Shapiro-Wilks ) indicate statistical analysis study variable . The value ( central tendency ) descriptive morphological , metabolic immunological characteristic present period ( pre- post-intervention ) , variance group significance level . ANOVA ( Friedman test ) two factor use comparison group moment ( pre post ) concern . All analyze perform use SPSS 17.0 software , assume prior statistical significance p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
