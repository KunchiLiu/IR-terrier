	<brief_summary>In cardiac surgery , assessment operative risk quality care major challenge patient , surgical team . It also important health care decisionmakers predictive tool compare alternative technics conventional cardiac surgery interventional cardiology . Since 1998 , European System Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation ( EuroSCORE ) , updated 2012 ( EuroSCORE II ) universally used system purpose . Its success result good balance predictive capability simplicity . It consist almost exclusively clinical variable . However , objectivity predictive ability clinical item remain controversial , particularly address severity illness high-risk patient . For instance , degree priority submit subjective assessment surgical team time surgery . Objective data describing severity patient arrive operating room still miss . Many biomarkers relevant qualify severity syndrome : shock ( PH , lactate , LDH ) , heart disease ( N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide ( NTproBNP ) , troponin T I ) , respiratory disorder ( blood gaz analysis ) , liver insufficiency ( TP , factor V ) , renal impairment ( serum creatinine , creatinine clearance ) , inflammatory condition ( fibrinogen , CRP ) , underlie medical condition diabetes ( HbA1c , microalbuminuria ) nutritional status ( albumin ) . In ICU , many score use biological data measure , daily basis , severity patient status . Their routine use simplify application available smartphones . They draw hospital information system . In cardiac surgery , study seem demonstrate measurement preoperative biological variable ( eg NT Pro-BNP ... ) risk prediction . In term diabetes , HbA1c particular interest detects underlie diabetes unknown ( emergent situation ) reflect poor control surgery . This criterion could reliable simple information patient treat insulin ( EuroSCORE II criterion ) . Finally , reinforcement exist score biological variable recommend group recommendation prognostic research strategy ( PROGRESS 2014 ) , rather create new score ex nihilo . The hypothesis add biological data collect time arrival patient operating room would better qualify patient ' severity condition therefore increase risk prediction early mortality severe morbidity cardiac surgery . The purpose study test hypothesis especially test whether biological data would increase EuroSCORE II performance , improve prediction high-risk patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main objective : To improve EuroSCORE II predictive power 90-day mortality and/or severe hospital morbidity , incorporate immediate preoperative biological data . Secondary objective : 1 . Analyze EuroSCORE II calibration risk group ( external validation ) . 2 . Studying improvement EuroSCORE II-bio predictive power risk class , especially high risk . 3 . Refine selection definition discriminate criterion diabetic predict surgical risk cardiac surgery ( HbA1c value , existence microalbuminuria , nature treatment etc. ) . 4 . Compare risk profile operate patient French Overseas Departments different site Western Europe .</detailed_description>
