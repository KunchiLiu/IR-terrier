	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot ulceration ( DFU ) common largely preventable complication diabetes . While ulcer treat successfully , persist become infect . Ultimately , nearly one fifth patient infect lower-extremity diabetic ulcer require amputation affect limb , result staggering cost patient healthcare system . Prevention identify people high risk key good clinical management patient . It uncommon patient suffer diabetes concomitant low extremity edema venous insufficiency subsequently may benefit graduated compression . However , common association peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) patient diabetes , clinician reluctant apply compressive dressing fear exacerbate symptom PAD possibility gangrene . A novel low voltage , battery power medical device , PulseFlow DFÂ® ( The Diabetic Boot Company , Ltd. UK ) endeavor assist treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers . The device provide hybrid functionality i.e . mobile air bladder pump plantar arch offload boot . The air bladder inflate 160 mmHg approx . 1 second deflates back atmospheric pressure , allow plantar vessel sufficient time refill . The offload boot design hold foot low leg position reduces shear friction force provide reduction plantar pressure . The PulseFlow DF design record many hour blood pump deliver . This data download clinic visit . The boot pump blood around participant 's foot unless fit correctly battery charge overnight . The purpose study conduct interventional study study N=15 diabetic subject active foot ulcer assess whether PulseFlow foot compression device help improve low extremity perfusion , whilst improve balance spatio-temporal parameter gait . The key goal propose project test whether specially design compression device improve low extremity perfusion , whilst also simultaneously improve balance walk performance . Investigators envision use specially design offload device compression capability help reduce incidence diabetic foot ulcer high-risk diabetic patient . In addition , investigator assume propose device might enhance daily physical activity well walk performance . Investigators conduct prospective clinical study validate hypothesis . Potential change walk spontaneous daily physical activity assess use validated technology include walk analyzer system , balance assessment use body worn sensor , computerized pressure insole .</brief_summary>
