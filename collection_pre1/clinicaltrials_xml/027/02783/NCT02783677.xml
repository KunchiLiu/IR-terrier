	<brief_summary>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) highly prevalent . It occur often low extremity . Symptoms include intermittent claudication , ischemic pain , ulceration necrosis . Amputation may necessary severe case . PAD also indicator future cerebrovascular cardiovascular event . Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) one major risk factor PAD . Approximately 5 % 10 % diabetic patient foot ulceration , 1 % undergone amputation . Other risk factor include smoking , old age , male gender , hypertension , dyslipidemia , hyperhomocysteinemia renal insufficiency . Ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) popular tool use screen PAD . Doppler-derived ankle brachial systolic pressure obtain . If ratio abnormal , confirmation study necessary . Although ABI recommend one screening test diabetic complication guideline , utility limit calcified non-compressible vessel , common DM renal failure patient . Digital infrared thermal imaging ( DITI ) use detect surface temperature object absolute temperature high zero would radiate electromagnetic wave certain wave length accord Plank 's law . DITI examination non-invasive , non-contact fast . Theoretically , temperature perfusion area occlusive artery decrease . Investigators analyze DITI PAD , observe relationship DITI , ABI vascular duplex examination . The dynamic change DITI percutaneous transluminal angioplasty PAD also observe . Investigators would like evaluate possibility clinical application DITI PAD screening .</brief_summary>
