	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate prevalence morphological feature coronary plaque mean OCT patient acute myocardial infarction without significant coronary stenosis coronary angiography . In addition , cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) perform assess prevalence , location , pattern myocardial injury well concomitant finding . As secondary analysis , association distribution characteristic coronary plaque detect OCT myocardial injury show CMR evaluate . In addition , post-hoc survey regard potential modification interventional treatment approach base OCT analysis conduct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mechanism myocardial infarction patient nonobstructive coronary artery disease remain unknown . The SOFT-MI study design single-center , prospective observational trial investigate prevalence vulnerable disrupt plaque patient acute MI without significant coronary stenosis ( defined stenosis &gt; 50 % ) coronary angiography . All patient undergo coronary OCT immediately coronary angiography . In addition , CMR perform within 1 week coronary angiography evaluate associate myocardial abnormality well extracardiac finding . The study provide insight mechanism MI without obstructive coronary artery disease coronary angiography , may useful order establish appropriate therapeutic strategy secondary prevention ischemic event .</detailed_description>
