	<brief_summary>The study drug , GSK3326595 , inhibitor protein arginine methyltransferase 5 ( PRMT5 ) potently inhibit tumor growth vitro vivo animal model . This first time human ( FTIH ) , open-label , dose escalation study ass safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , preliminary clinical activity GSK3326595 subject advanced recurrent solid tumor , well clinical activity subject subset solid tumor non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . This open-label , repeat-dose , multicenter , 2-part study establish maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) / recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) base safety tolerability preliminary clinical efficacy orally-administered GSK3326595 . Part 1 dose-escalation phase identify MTD/RP2D base safety , PK , PD profile observe oral administration GSK3326595 . This Part conduct adult subject relapse and/or refractory solid tumor . It estimate 42 subject enrol dose escalation cohort study , include 30 subject identify MTD approximately 12 subject PK/PD/metabolite/biomarker expansion cohort ( ) . Disease-specific expansion cohort ( Part 2 ) plan explore clinical activity GSK3326595 subject select solid tumor non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . It estimate 138 subject enrol disease-specific expansion cohort study . The duration study depend recruitment rate time subject ' duration study ( withdrawal rate due toxicity progression ) , approximate duration 2 year .</brief_summary>
