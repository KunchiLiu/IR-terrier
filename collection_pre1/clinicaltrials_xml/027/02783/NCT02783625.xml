	<brief_title>Trial Duvelisib Combination With Either Romidepsin Bortezomib Relapsed/Refractory T-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase I portion study design determine MTD duvelisib romidepsin duvelisib bortezomib . All patient must relapse refractory T-cell lymphoma . The design standard 3+3 dose escalation two parallel phase I study . Patients enrol Arms A ( Romidepsin + duvelisib ) B ( Bortezomib + duvelisib ) study start dose level 1 . Three six patient initially treat dose level MTD determine . If dose level 3 achieve without exceed one dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) 1 cycle dose level deem `` optimal dose '' study proceed cohort expansion phase . Should patient find develop significant toxicity tolerate therapy MTD repeat cycle therapy , `` optimal dose '' may determine dose level less MTD . Patients measurable disease treat phase I optimal dose count towards accrual expansion cohort disease subtype efficacy toxicity endpoint . Cohort Expansion Phase : The expansion cohorts assess toxicity safety allow preliminary assessment efficacy combination provide background potential future subtype specific phase II study . The assessment efficacy descriptive .</detailed_description>

Age ≥ 18 Previous systemic anticancer therapy must discontinue least 3 week prior treatment . For cohort expansion phase , progress subject , 2 week washout may allow discussion MSK Principal Investigator . Previous radiation and/or surgery must discontinue complete least 2 week prior treatment study adverse effect must resolve Grade 1 baseline . Lymph node diagnostic biopsy within 2 week consider exclusionary . ECOG ≤ 2 Meet follow laboratory criterion without use growth factor support platelet transfusion 1 week : ) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 K/mcl , ii ) Platelet count ≥ 80 K/μl ( expansion cohort , thrombocytopenia due bone marrow involvement platelet count must ≥ 50 K/μL ) , iii ) Phase 1 patient enrolled expansion cohort must calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50ml/min CockcroftGault formula . Expansion cohort subject must calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 40ml/min CockcroftGault formula . iv ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN Measurable disease expansion cohort lead phase . ) Lymphoma ( include CTCL patient without evidence disease skin ) : CT PET/CT modify Cheson criterion incorporation PET . ii ) CTCL : mSWAT &gt; 0 , absolute Sezary count ≥ 1000 cells/μL . Short course systemic corticosteroid disease control , improvement performance status noncancer indication ( &lt; 7 day ) must discontinue least 6 day prior study treatment . Stable ongoing corticosteroid use ( ≥ 30 day ) equivalent dose 20 mg prednisone permissible . ) Topical steroid use &gt; 3 week may continue ( CTCL ) . Women reproductive potential† must negative serum urine β human chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test . All woman reproductive potential , sexually active male patient , partner patient must agree use adequate method birth control ( e.g . latex condom ) throughout study 30 day last dose study drug . A female reproductive potential sexually mature female : undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e . menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Pregnant female . ( Lactating female must agree breast feed take study medication ) . Prior use duvelisib discontinue due toxicity . For romidepsin arm study , prior therapy romidepsin discontinue due toxicity . For bortezomib arm study , prior therapy proteasome inhibitor discontinue due toxicity . For bortezomib arm study , patient grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy . Concurrent use anticancer agent treatment . History chronic liver disease , venoocclusive disease , current alcohol abuse . Administration live vaccine within 6 week first dose study drug . Prior surgery gastrointestinal dysfunction may affect drug absorption ( e.g. , gastric bypass surgery , gastrectomy ) Known seropositive require antiviral therapy human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Subjects chronic hepatitis B C define test . Subjects positive Hep B serology . Subjects negative HBsAg positive HBcAb require undetectable/negative hepatitis B DNA test ( e.g. , polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] test ) enrol , require prophylactic antiviral treatment ( e.g. , F ) initiate prior first dose study drug , continue approximately 6 12 month completion study drug ( ) . Patients positive hepatitis C virus Ab Subjects active EBV unrelated underlying lymphoma ( positive serology antiEBV VCA IgM antibody negative antiEBV EBNA IgG antibody , clinical manifestation positive EBV PCR consistent active EBV infection . Subject active CMV ( positive serology antiCMV IgM antibody negative antiCMV IgG antibody positive CMV PCR clinical manifestation consistent active CMV infection ) require therapy exclude participation study . Carriers monitor per institutional guideline . Concurrent malignancy require active therapy . Patients one type lymphoma may enrol discussion MSK Principal Investigator . Known central nervous system meningeal involvement ( absence symptom , investigation central nervous system involvement require ) . The follow known cardiac abnormality : 1 . Congenital long QT syndrome . 2 . QTc/QTf interval ≥ 480 millisecond ; unless secondary pacemaker bundle branch block . 3 . Myocardial infarction within 6 month . ( Subjects history myocardial infarction within last 6 to12 month asymptomatic negative cardiac risk assessment ( treadmill stress test , nuclear medicine stress test , stress echocardiogram ) since event may participate . ) 4 . Other significant ECG abnormality include 2nd degree atrio ventricular ( AV ) block ( AV ) block type II , 3rd degree AV block . 5 . Symptomatic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , e.g. , angina Canadian Class IIIV ( see Appendix B ) . In patient doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present . IIIV ( see Appendix B ) . In patient doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present . 6 . An ECG record screen show evidence cardiac ischemia ( ST depression ≥2 mm , measure isoelectric line ST segment ) . If doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present . 7 . Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II IV definition ( see Appendix C ) and/or ejection fraction &lt; 45 % MUGA , echocardiogram , cardiac MRI . 8 . A known history sustain ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) , ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) , Torsade de Pointes , cardiac arrest unless currently address automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( AICD ) . 9 . Hypertrophic cardiomegaly restrictive cardiomyopathy prior treatment cause . 10 . Uncontrolled hypertension , i.e. , blood pressure ( BP ) ≥170/95 ; patient history hypertension control medication must stable dose ( least one month prior study registration ) meet inclusion criterion . 11 . Any cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic medication ( exclude stable dos betablockers ) 12 .
