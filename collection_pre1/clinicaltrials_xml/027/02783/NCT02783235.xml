	<brief_summary>This study aim create video-based tutorial develop skill perform cervical cancer screen use VIA Auxillary Nurse Midwives ( ANMs ) , Accredited Social Health Activists ( ASHAs ) Primary Health Workers ( PHWs ) . Cervical cancer screen mainly do follow three method : Visual inspection acetic acid ( VIA ) , Cervical Smear Cytology ( PAP ) HPV DNA test . VIA low cost , low resource cervical cancer screen method especially useful low middle income country ( LMICs ) like India . We propose develop video-based tutorial , ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs could train perform interpret VIA use tutorial . The ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs important role deliver health rural/ semi urban area train use tutorial . The video-based tutorial make accord 'Spoken Tutorials ' methodology , develop IIT Bombay . Video-based Tutorials give skill base train 2 lakh student past four year IT base topic . The tutorial make available online free cost . They design use without need expert physically present .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cervical Cancer Screening : Video Based Tutorials ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim study : 1 . To develop video-based tutorial train ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs conduct cervical cancer relate health education , screen cervical cancer use VIA , collection PAP smear HPV sample . 2 . To reduce train time require expert train ANMs/ASHA/PHWs compare traditional training method . 3 . To evaluate efficacy train tool conduct pre-test post-test practical test lesion identification . 4 . To assess satisfaction level ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs learn video-based tutorial . Methodology : A . Creating Tutorials 1 ) The video-based tutorial create help domain expert , Content generator Animators . B . Conducting Training 1 . TMH recruit Medical Social Workers Health Workers provide train 50 ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs centre . 2 . The training stagger different module , complete trainee period approximately 3 month . The investigator also obtain image due permission , clinic , preparation examination like arrangement trolley , preparation dilute acetic acid , etc . cervical pictures/ video patient VIA obtain due consent ( reveal identity ) aid animation tutorial . The effectiveness tutorial check pre- post- tutorial assessment quiz . Sample Size power estimate : For study , sample method convenience sample 50 ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs attach TMC , District , Municipal Hospitals PHCs learn VIA base cervical cancer screening . Three MSWs appoint co-ordinate respective official BMC , State Government , District hospital etc . explain importance project . The Social Workers approach different BMC hospital Mumbai PHCs district hospital around Mumbai relieve ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs participate training . Newly recruit PHWs Preventive Oncology project also enrol training . 1 . Pre train knowledge various aspect cervical cancer viz. , cause , various cervical cancer screen technique , step require perform VIA etc . 2 . The satisfaction level fee back trainees course provide . 3 . Improvement Post training knowledge various aspect cervical cancer viz. , cause , various cervical cancer screen technique , step require perform VIA etc . These measure help test score . Each question test mark assign base difficulty level . ( Easy 1 mark , Intermediate 2 mark , Hard 3 mark , Very hard 4 mark ) . The ANMs assign mark depend number correct response . The ANMs take test training , immediately training , three month train complete . The satisfaction level mode teach do survey base likert scale . 4 . Ability correctly identify VIA positive lesion . This measure base mark score test assignment , image base diagnosis 15 VIA case . This also score base observation session doctor performs VIA 10 patient . They assess base number correct identification VIA lesion . Data entry analysis : Data entry do IIT Bombay Department Preventive Oncology , Tata Memorial Hospital , use SPSS version 18 . Checks consistency , data safety analysis carry regular interval . Both descriptive inferential statistic generate describe variable study objective . Agreement test score , pre-training post-training estimate use kappa statistic .</detailed_description>
