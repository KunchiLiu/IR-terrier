	<brief_title>Evaluating Effects Genetic Testing Patients ' Stress Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Breast cancer second lead cause cancer death woman ( ACS , 2013 ) . Genetic screening also become increasingly important treat breast cancer patient , 5-10 % breast cancer link mutation BRCA1/2 gene ( Miki , 1994 ) ( Wooster , 1995 ) . As field genetic test rapidly expand multigene panel available , unclear psychological consequence result knowledge gain test . RATIONALE : Breast cancer clinician frequently employ genetic test breast cancer patient . It unclear psychological consequence result knowledge gain test . A literature review reveals result contradictory term determine stress level relate test result . This due different study methodology . The Medical College Wisconsin Cancer Center researcher generate definitive answer prospective study establish baseline stress level , evaluate pre- post- test stress level multiple time point , focus change stress level different result subgroup . Evaluating impact genetic test stress level help health care professional well understand consequence genetic testing , thus , provide good care patient medically psychologically potential intervention decrease stress . STUDY PROCEDURES : Patients contact phone genetic counseling appointment make , prior visit member research team . After give informed consent , patient provide State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) Adults handout measure baseline anxiety , well Health Anxiety Inventory Cancer Worry Scale measure baseline health anxiety several additional demographic question . Subjects complete validate questionnaire privately return genetic counselor . The data collect time point measure stress level genetic counseling testing . Patients contact phone four time take HAI CWS survey phone ( one week receive genetic testing result , three week consult ; five week ; three month six month ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Females 18 year old . Identified currently diagnose breast cancer within past six month classify high risk develop breast cancer ( i.e. , family history cancer put risk breast cancer ) Froedtert Hospital &amp; Medical College Wisconsin Cancer Genetics Screening Program . Prior genetic test breast cancer . Patient referral genetic testing outside hospital system access outside medical record . Past medical history breast cancer ( include current diagnosis breast cancer within past six month ) . Current past history ovarian cancer . Known family history BRCA1/2 mutation cancer susceptibility genetic mutation . Patients see day hospital genetic counseling administer chemotherapy .</criteria>
