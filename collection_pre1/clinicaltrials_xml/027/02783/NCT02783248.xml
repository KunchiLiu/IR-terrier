	<detailed_description>This multicenter prospective observational study conduct French medico-surgical site . The Percutaneous Mitral Commissurotomy ( PMC ) standard treatment Mitral stenosis ( MS ) patient rheumatic favorable characteristic . In Western country MS reach old patient less favorable characteristic , include presence mitral calcification . Calcifications factor poor outcome PMC . The scanner appear useful examination study carry systematically . The prediction late result PMC particularly important patient non-ideal characteristic form particularly heterogeneous population . A score late result PMC wider western series recently release date receive external validation . In score , prediction result multifactorial , consideration paramount clinical factor , also prognostic significance mitral calcification . The validation predictive score late result PMC , analysis calcification , would better select patient may best benefit PMC surgical management prefer . The aim study validate external sample predictive score event-free survival patient good immediate result PMC . This study , purely observational , create special procedure outside patient 's usual care .</detailed_description>
