Potential participant assess eligibility initial assessment depressive symptom . The initial assessment phase consist administration PHQ-9 short screen telephone interview . Subsequent assessment consist instrument present Outcome measure section . After initial assessment , participant meet inclusion criterion randomly assign one two condition : immediate online intervention condition ( Group 1 ) delayed-intervention condition ( wait-list ) ( Group 2 ) . Participants assign Group 1 give access online application along explicit instruction regard use section . Participants give 4 week complete intervention , time weekly message send . Messages include regular assignment design complete thorough use application 's course exercise , encourage review material whenever possible . However , participant free use application pace .
