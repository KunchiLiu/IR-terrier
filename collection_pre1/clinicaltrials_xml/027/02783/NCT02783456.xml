	<brief_title>The Influence Aircraft Noise Exposure Renal Hemodynamic Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) estimate ( 340 million population ) 1 million annually health life year lose environmental noise exposure high-income country Western Europe . Aircraft noise thereby assess comparable volume unpleasant road rail noise . Epidemiological study find link aircraft noise exposure increase incidence arterial hypertension thus cardiovascular disease . The underlying pathophysiological mechanism yet fully understood . The kidney act long-term regulator blood pressure control extracellular sodium water balance . Significant renal mechanism blood pressure regulation renin angiotensin system , renal sympathetic activity sodium excretion . Animal work clinical study show mental stress affect renal plasma flow urinary sodium excretion . In spontaneously hypertensive rat environmental stress result sodium retention , trigger increased renal sympathetic nerve activity , development arterial hypertension . In pilot study subject risk develop arterial hypertension , investigator observe low sodium excretion mental stress . In healthy volunteer , 30-minute mental stress test result increase glomerular filtration rate , filtration fraction increase urinary sodium excretion . In rabbit noise exposure lead increase frequency amplitude discharge renal sympathetic nerve activity accompany reduction renal plasma flow . The impact aircraft noise renal plasma flow urinary sodium excretion , knowledge , far studied human . In pilot study Clinical Research Center investigate influence 30 minute standardize aircraft noise renal hemodynamics . Hemodynamic renal change consider context systemic circulation . Therefore , central hemodynamics determine present pilot study bioimpedance cardiography .</detailed_description>
