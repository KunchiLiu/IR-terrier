	<detailed_description>Increasing success rate rotator cuff healing remain tremendous challenge orthopedic surgeon , encourage development new biological therapy . Among many approach , possibility activate resident stem cell situ , without need isolate biopsy successive vitro culturing , could represent promise therapeutic strategy . Along line , recently demonstrate lipoaspirate product , Lipogems® product , contain produce growth factor may activate resident stem cell . Recently , discover also human rotator cuff contain reservoir progenitor cell , isolate expanded vitro . The primary goal study evaluate efficacy infiltration autologous micro-fragmented adipose tissue arthroscopic rotator cuff repair , term gain post-operative Constant score . Secondary goal evaluate efficacy infiltration autologous micro-fragmented adipose tissue arthroscopic rotator cuff repair , term post-operative pain reduction , gain post-operative strength abduction external rotation ; estimate incidence re-ruptures 1 2 year post-operatively , quantify amount fatty degeneration supraspinatus 1 2 year post-operatively .</detailed_description>
