	<brief_title>Gender- Culturally-Sensitive Weight Loss Intervention Hispanic Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In U.S. , Hispanic males high rate overweight obesity compare male racial/ethnic group place great risk obesity-related disease . Yet , current literature lack inform best practice engage Hispanic male weight loss and/or promote successful weight loss trajectory . Without information health disparity associate obesity obesity-related chronic disease continue . Evidence exist support behavioral weight loss reduce obesity-related health risk . There limited data suggest program effective men data support feasibility effectiveness program among Hispanic male despite fast grow high burden group obesity-related disease within U.S. population . Using exist practice guideline evidence recently complete in-depth qualitative interview overweight/obese Hispanic male , investigator test novel intervention approach address gap knowledge . The investigator propose 1 ) ass feasibility , acceptability preliminary efficacy gender- culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention 48 overweight/obese Hispanic male age 18-64 12 week ; 2 ) ass participant characteristic process measure relate uptake mobile-health ( mHealth ) technology overweight/obese Hispanic male 12 week ; 3 ) ass pathologic change liver Hispanic men enrol 12-week weight loss intervention use non-invasive MRI therapeutic response biomarker . This project challenge current research paradigm Hispanic male test gender- culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention provide highly impactful formative research use novel mHealth self-monitoring technology facilitate dietary/physical activity behavior change . Given Hispanic population fast grow U.S. , effort identify strategy promote weight control among Hispanic male potential significantly impact public health . The expected outcome propose project identification feasible appropriate weight loss intervention strategy improve engagement weight management vulnerable ethnic group .</detailed_description>
