	<brief_title>Prospective Post Y90 Liver Hypertrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study protocol : Prospective study early contra-lateral liver lobar hypertrophy unilobar Y-90 selective internal radiation therapy ( SIRT ) patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) All patient schedule undergo unilobar ( Right leave ) SIRT Y-90 HCC Singapore General Hospital National Cancer Center Singapore study period may enrol . The target sample size 25 2 year Information baseline demographic disease staging , well pre- post-treatment tumour liver dimension would prospectively obtain . The diagnosis HCC make base current accept diagnostic criterion ie . characteristic appearance contrast-enhanced quadriphasic CT scan and/or MRI , raise serum AFP level presence know risk factor . The RECIST criterion use evaluate tumour response disease progression time final volume determination . Patients schedule unilobar SIRT consent study enrol study . Liver volume measure 3 time point . CT volumetry perform : 1 ) prior treatment ; 2 ) 4 6 week 3 ) 8 to12 week SIRT . Administration Y90 SIRT This base current institution practice . All patient would review regard suitability Y90 SIRT give appropriate counselling advice regard angiographic procedure Y90 SIRT procedure , include potential side-effects . The patient undergo baseline blood investigation , typically liver function test , renal function test well full blood count coagulation profile . All prior image CT MRI review . Mapping hepatic angiography 99mTc-MAA ( micro-aggregated albumin ) injection perform accord standard technique . Prophylactic coil embolization vessel risk perform either map hepatic angiography 90Y radioembolization , discretion interventional radiologist . The catheter tip position 99mTc-MAA injection decide consensus interventional radiologist nuclear medicine physician mapping hepatic angiography . 99mTc-MAA slowly hand-injected indwelling catheter . Patients subsequently immediately transfer gamma-camera suite planar liver-to-lung shunt scintigraphy SPECT/CT abdomen . Y90 microspheres treatment plan artery-specific SPECT/CT partition model described literature . All treatment plan team experience nuclear medicine physician . Y90 SIRT perform use resin microspheres ( SIR-Spheres ; Sirtex Medical Ltd. ) within 2 week map hepatic angiography . Catheter tip placement 99mTc-MAA injection . In accordance institutional protocol , patient observe overnight treatment . They discharge follow day Bremsstrahlung planar scintigraphy lung SPECT/CT abdomen perform . Measurement liver volume Liver volume measure 3 time point . All patient undergo CT volumetry baseline , 4-6 week 8-12 week SIRT . Multiphasic dynamic contrast-enhanced hepatic CT scan obtain either Dual Source CT ( Siemens Medical ) Brilliance iCT ( Philips Medical System ) . Scans obtain use standard four phase liver protocol multidetector CT system least 64-channel detector . Contrast medium administer patient acquisition arterial-phase portal-venous-phase equilibrium CT image . The CT scan parameter include collimation 0.625-1.2mm . The reconstructed slice thickness scan 0.8 - 1.5 mm reconstruction interval 0.4 - 1 mm . Reconstructed CT slice matrix size 512Ã—512 pixel . The image measure use commercially available 3D software ( Vital 's Vitrea Advanced CT Liver Oncology package ) manually correct , review resect single senior radiologist ensure consistency follow anatomical landmark . The software allow save work perform order allow review rechecking final measurement . If patient ' pretreatment CT scan perform SGH NCC , need undergo additional baseline CT scan volumetry may perform exist image data . However , need undergo baseline CT scan pretreatment scan perform outside campus . Subsequently , patient 's need undergo 2 follow-up CT scan 4 6 week 8 12 week administration SIRT . Primary outcome : 1 . The change volume contralateral liver volume baseline 2 . Change volume ipsilateral liver baseline 3 . HCC tumor response progression treatment accord RECIST criterion . Follow-up Other 2 additional follow-up CT scan , patient 's undergo follow-up per regular non-study patient treat SIRT .</detailed_description>
