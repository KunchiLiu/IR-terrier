	<detailed_description>The study conduct physiotherapy clinic HUJBB . The sample compose 26 volunteer moderate severe COPD , gender , recruit population start treatment pulmonology HUJBB physiotherapy clinic . All participant undergo assessment base use HUJBB , blood analysis , heart rate variability , AQ20 questionary , 6-minute walk test Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program . The evaluation carry pre-existing general assessment form use hospital outpatient . The sheet contains : identification data ; medical history ; diagnose disease ; Drug use ; Use oxygen ; nutrition exercise habit ; Physical exam ; Investigations ; functional kinetic evaluation ; Goals ; treatment/management . Since use : identification data ; diagnose disease ; Use Oxygen ; nutrition exercise habit goal . Morphological assessment EOX blood plasma perform accord test know Optical Microscopy cell analysis vitro HLB test , also know name Dry layer oxidative test , investigator refer microscopic morphology EOX plasma ( EEW ) . The EEW provide indirect information concern EOX , among others , use follow grade system percentage discontinuous area clot , present microscope slide : grade I ( normal EOX rate , total area discontinuity extracellular matrix ( ME ) less 10 % ) , grade II ( light EOX ME discontinuity area 10 20 % ) , grade III ( moderate EOX ME discontinuity area 20 30 % ) , grade IV ( serious EOX ME discontinuity area 30 40 % ) grade V ( serious EOX ME discontinuity area 40 % ) 18 . By lance medial side digital pulp fourth finger leave hand previously sanitize alcohol , collect blood drop next microscope slide five light touch blade drop . After procedure , blade keep place protect contact blood room temperature ( 23 ° C ) nine-minute period realization collect blood clotting process . At end period , morphological pattern clot see increase 40 time set protocolo18 assign qualitative graduation log spreadsheet statistical analysis . The coagulated blood study Videomicroscopy ( microscope NIPOM brand ) , select best histological field , picture analyze Image Pro Plus see field blood coagulation make , discontinuity program provide percentage oxidative stress . This analysis test allow indirect notion oxidative stress level study patient evaluate therapeutic development . The uptake HRV perform via heart rate monitor Polar ® brand , RS800CX model FC signal receive strap signal receiver place voluntary thorax level xiphoid sternum . This funding record Polar RS800CX monitor transfer Software Polar ProTrainer program broadcast interface infrared signal , store subsequently export txt format later analyze mathematical routine Kubios HRV program . In program select 5 minute passage good signal stability . HRV analyze rest supine position . This test evaluate variability heart rate response check modulation autonomic control rest supine position . Volunteers ask remain rest period 10 minute , avoid talk researcher heart rate undergo change . Then begin collection heart rate duration 10 minute supine position maintain spontaneous breathing . The AQ20 apply twice patient , first day second time end program . Only two researcher participate questionnaire . The hall use perform 6MWT comfortable temperature , close outdoor environment , since flat , little traveled interruption walk people move . Usually use corridor 30 meter long , obstacle time make turn must mark cone . The test objective walk alone pace far possible six minute guide possible cardiorespiratory change may arise , allow walk slowly , stop , relax need return walk feel able resume walk . You must walk without talk people around cone back quickly around continue walk without hesitation . The path must show patient examiner start walking . The training run 2 time week ( Monday Wednesday Tuesday Thursday ) , last approximately 50 minute specific training ( aerobic strengthening ) , 10 week , make total 20 day exercise . During period volunteer tell perform complementary physical activity and/or addition another rehabilitation program . strengthen exercise involve large muscle group region shoulder , knee hip close open chain use Neuromuscular Facilitation ( PNF ) upper extremity exercise within movement diagonal Kabat method ( flexion -adduction -rotation external / foreign flexion - abduction -rotation / internal extension - abduction - rotation / internal extension - adduction - rotation ) . The exercise follow protocol 3 set 10 repetition interval 30 second rest .</detailed_description>
