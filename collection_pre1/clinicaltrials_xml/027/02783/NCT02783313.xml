	<detailed_description>Currently pathogen-reduced platelet product ( PR-PCs ) pass phase III study , progress expect near future . At present transfusion center throughout Europe implement PR-PCs , yet PR-PCs formally accept standard product apply nation-wide . Because many uncertainty currently exist `` optimal '' platelet product , interest patient , health care provider transfusion provider ( Sanquin ) decide evidence . With current safety measure remain place , pathogen reduction provide safety benefit reduce number transfusion platelet concentrate contaminate bacteria , miss screen method . In Dutch situation , morbidity estimate 1:14,000 platelet concentrate [ Te Boekhorst , Transfusion 2005 ] . In publication , two case transmission B. cereus platelet transfusion report , patient experience life-threatening sepsis , recover eventually . Cases bacterial transmission however often go unnoted , frequency low 1:130,000 report [ Dumont , Transfusion 2010 ] . The true mortality ; value range 1:50,000 1:500,000 . A precautionary benefit protection know unknown pathogen . It difficult estimate actual risk , consequently estimate benefit patient . While The Netherlands epidemic occur screen test could develop , include Q-fever , small real risk epidemic wipe blood supply country . This happen La Réunion , epidemic chikungunya virus urge import blood product abroad , follow rapid introduction pathogen reduction technology ensure blood supply [ Rasongles , Transfusion 2009 ] . An outbreak virus Italy result suspension blood collection affect area , lead low blood inventory well reduced delivery plasma fractionation institute . Appreciating difficulty extrapolate vitro test towards vivo efficacy , platelet product test clinical trial . Of note , radiolabeling technique volunteer require FDA , use Netherlands . For major product variation Netherlands , investigator depend study patient . Extending storage logistic purpose , combine maintain even improve safety platelet product , maintain clinical efficacy main feature development new platelet product . In study protocol , aim investigate transfusion efficacy two different platelet product : plasma-PCs , pathogen-reduced ( PR ) -plasma-PCs , combine extend storage without treatment photochemical pathogen reduction technique . Prior start clinical study vitro study product perform , show study product meet current vitro quality requirement release transfusion . However , site implementation validation still take place . Refractoriness platelet transfusion bleed complication main clinical problem intensively treat hemato-oncological patient essential endpoint transfusion study well . In trial , bleeding score accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) scale primary endpoint . Refractoriness define 1-hour CCI &lt; 7.5 and/or 24-hour CCI &lt; 4.5 ABO compatible platelet transfusion least two successive occasion . Known cause non-alloimmune refractoriness include trial purpose generalization , relevant develop national product , test transfusion efficacy new platelet product imply patient need preventive support platelet transfusion . The 1- 24-hour CCI commonly use evaluate platelet transfusion , albeit without discussion , currently platelet count parameter trigger-based transfusion policy . The ratio 1-hour 24-hour CCI mirror platelet recovery immediately transfusion 1-hour CCI , platelet survival one day transfusion 24-hour CCI . Other secondary clinical endpoint trial transfusion requirement ( red cell platelet ) , transfusion interval next transfusion adverse reaction .</detailed_description>
