	<brief_summary>This study investigate central mechanism Overactive Bladder ( OAB ) Patients Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . The plan enroll 10 adult Parkinson 's disease Overactive bladder ( PD + OAB ) 10 adult Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Both group undergo fMRI ( functional MRI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Central Mechanisms Overactive Bladder Adults With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) physical problem cause strong urge urinate , frequent urination , sometimes urinary incontinence ( accidental loss urine control ) commonly patient Parkinson ' disease ( PD ) severely impact quality life . Unfortunately OAB adult PD difficult treat . This largely mechanisms underlie OAB adult PD known . Recent functional MRI ( fMRI ) study suggest certain area brain important role OAB . Blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI image technique neural activity region brain measure fluctuation BOLD signal . It hop finding study allow development new treatment adults Parkinson 's disease overactive bladder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis PD United Kingdom ( UK ) brain bank criterion . PD patient without OAB per bladder questionnaire . No change PD medication screen , dose change study , except pro nata ( PRN ) dose carbidopa/levodopa allow address periodic worsen parkinsonian symptom . Patient willing able complete study questionnaire . Use medication could influence bladder function , permit long dose stable study . Patient expect valid health insurance duration study period . Women breastfeed , pregnant potential become pregnant course study ( fertile unwilling/unable use effective contraceptive measure ) . Cognitive deficit opinion investigator would interfere subject 's ability give inform consent perform study test . Evidence Urinary Tract Infection ( UTI ) screening . Bladder pain history chronic inflammation interstitial cystitis , recurrent UTIs , bladder stone , bladder obstruction , previous pelvic radiation therapy , previous current malignant disease pelvic organ . Adults interstim device place . Claustrophobia , occupational risk ferrous metal eye , implantable medical device foreign body preclude fMRI ( e.g . cardiac pacemaker , metallic fragment , orthopedic hardware ) . Intravesical botulinum toxin treatment within previous six month screen . Use indwell catheter selfcatheterization . Any serious and/or unstable medical condition</criteria>
