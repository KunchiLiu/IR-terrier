	<detailed_description>Overview : The current study , collaboration Indiana University Bloomington ( PI : Bates ) Indiana University School Medicine ( PI : Honaker ) , seek evaluate impact add sleep component parent intervention show effectively treat disruptive behavior child . A mealtime intervention serve active control sleep treatment component , mealtime intervention target change family routine unlikely significantly impact sleep . Participants receive sleep component expect show significant improvement sleep compare mealtime group . The investigator hypothesize child receive sleep intervention reduce presleep arousal level compare baseline , show great reduction presleep arousal level mealtime/control group . Finally , document link poor sleep externalize behavior problem theoretical argument sleep mechanism support emotional behavioral self-regulation , investigator hypothesize participant receive sleep component show great reduction disruptive behavior compare mealtime/control group . Participants Design : Participants 3-8-year-old child exhibit disruptive behavior parent . Participants meet criteria parent-training program offer part general clinic practice would approach therapist discus participation study . Following consent procedure , would randomly assign one two group . The sleep intervention group would receive brief , novel sleep intervention ( The Sleep Train Program ) context parent program 's Setting Up Success segment , focus positive routine . Sleep would address briefly need subsequent session . The mealtime/control group would receive particular intervention guidance regard sleep , would instead focus routine mealtime . All family would receive core intervention disruptive behavior . Following completion data collection , family receive sleep component would receive mealtime component , vice versa . Interventions : The exist parenting skill intervention largely build Troubled Families : A Treatment Program , manualized treatment approach extensive empirical support , select currently deliver clinical psychology trainee Psychological Clinic Indiana University Bloomington . The sleep intervention control intervention focus mealtime structure design parallel term structure length . Though neither intervention evaluate ( developed study ) , incorporate treatment strategy empirical basis . The sleep intervention focus sufficient sleep , healthy sleep habit , positive bedtime routine , optional module help address bedtime problem , night waking , fear , anxiety , independent sleep . The mealtime intervention focus healthy mealtime habit mealtime routine , optional module address picky eat disruptive mealtime behavior . Data collection measure : Some data record daily throughout study , include parent diary measure child sleep main child misbehavior ( noncompliance , tantrum , aggression ) . Other data collect 4 major assessment period . The baseline assessment occur end initial assessment family prior first treatment session . The midpoint assessment occur prior start discipline intervention , approximately six week start treatment . This assessment period allow evaluation disruptive behavior sleep follow sleep component introductory segment ( Setting Up Success ) , prior initiation core disruptive behavior / parent intervention . In word , improvement disruptive behavior could attribute largely sleep mealtime addition rather core parent intervention . The second midpoint assessment occur follow core intervention , prior initiate sleep/mealtime component previously cover . This allow evaluation combine sleep disruptive behavior intervention , well comparison treatment outcome receive sleep component receive mealtime/control component . A final assessment occur follow conclusion treatment . Survey data collect use on-line form create REDCap , complete tablet loan family . Measures select assess sleep , disruptive behavior , child daytime function generally , family functioning . An actigraph worn child one week four assessment period , interpretation aid accompany sleep diary . An Empatica E3 device use assess electro dermal activity ( EDA ) measure presleep arousal . The child ask wear device even start bedtime routine sleep onset , point parent ask remove device . Individuals collaborate study include : John Bates PhD ( co-PI ) , Indiana University Bloomington ; Amy Williams PhD , Indiana University School Medicine , several graduate student Indiana University Bloomington , specifically Maureen McQuillan , Caroline Hoyniak , Brittany Rudd , Kyle Gerst .</detailed_description>
