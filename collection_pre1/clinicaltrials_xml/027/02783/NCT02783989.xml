	<brief_title>Effects Cardiovascular Risk Factors Endogenous Hydroxytyrosol Generation After Combined Intake Wine Tyrosol Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study support light moderate alcohol drinking ( 10-20g per day ) , may reduce risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , stroke , dementia , depression , all-cause mortality . In addition , moderate red wine consumption recently show inversely associated decline global cognitive function domains memory flexibility . The claimed beneficial effect Mediterranean diet include prevention several age-related dysfunction include cardiovascular neurodegenerative disease . These effect relate protection cognitive decline associate age disease number polyphenols find red wine virgin olive oil . Neurodegenerative disease , chronic degenerative disease , link inflammation inter-twined phenomenon : oxidation oxidative damage . The interrelationship among chronic degenerative disease also evidence fact vascular ( cardiovascular ) risk factor associate cognitive decline , vascular factor currently know modifiable risk factor Alzheimer disease . There evidence suggest DOPET , also know hydroxytyrosol ( HOTYR ) , role cardioprotective neuroprotective property wine . It phenolic compound present virgin olive oil wine , potent dietary anti-inflammatory antioxidant molecule . Biological effect HOTYR may explain part beneficial effect human health credit moderate ethanol intake ( form wine ) . The present project intend provide support clinical use moderate- dose alcohol treatment modality CVD risk patient . Nevertheless , investigate novel mechanism action may explain part beneficial health effect associate moderate alcohol consumption . This novel mechanism action mediate compound mid/long-term run susceptible pharmaceutical and/or nutraceutical food development .</detailed_description>
