	<brief_summary>Palpitations ( noticeable pounding , flutter irregular heart beat ) pre-syncope ( near blackout ) common ED problem sometimes due abnormal cardiac rhythm . This difficult diagnose examination electrocardiogram ( ECG ) commonly normal symptom usually resolve time patient arrive ED . Diagnosing abnormal heart rhythm cause symptom rest capture ECG patient usually discharge advice return ED 12-lead ECG symptom recur . The investigator recruit 242 adult participant either study control arm . All study arm participant give AliveCor Heart Monitor train use device . Control arm participant receive standard care . Both group followed-up 90 day . The investigator believe smart phone base event recorder allow well early diagnosis patient compatible smart phone tablet , revolutionise ED care area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Palpitations ( noticeable pounding , flutter irregular heart beat ) pre syncope ( near blackout ) common ED problem sometimes due abnormal heart rhythm . Diagnosis difficult examination electrocardiogram ( ECG ) commonly normal symptom usually resolve time patient arrive ED . Diagnosing abnormal heart rhythm cause symptom rest capture ECG patient usually advise return ED 12-lead ECG symptom recur . The investigator recruit 242 participant age 16 year present ED Medical Assessment Unit Royal Infirmary Edinburgh episode palpitation pre-syncope remain undiagnosed ED assessment . The investigator randomise allocate participant either study control arm . All study arm participant give AliveCor Heart Monitor train use device . Control arm participant receive standard care . If participant allocate study arm palpitation pre-syncope 90-day study period , participant record ECG use AliveCor Monitor view study team . Participants ask log symptom whether participant able record ECG symptom participant symptom diary , participant return research team along Participant satisfaction compliance questionnaire , smart phone base event recorder end 90 day pre-paid stamp , address envelope . Participants phone 90 day remind participant complete Participant satisfaction compliance questionnaire return symptom diary smart phone base event recorder . The investigator believe smart phone base event recorder allow well early diagnosis patient .</detailed_description>
