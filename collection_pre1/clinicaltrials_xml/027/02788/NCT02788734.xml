	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn focal compressive median neuropathy wrist ( Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ) outcomes therapy ( e.g . conservative surgery ) upper extremity patient diagnose inherited neuropathy . All patient enrol Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network ( RDCRN ) Inherited Neuropathies Consortium ( INC ) Contact Registry mark one follow disorder : CMT1A , CMT1B , CMT2A , CMT4 , CMTX , know CMT peripheral neuropathy , unknown CMT peripheral neuropathy , Hereditary Neuropathy liability Pressure Palsies ( HNPP ) , invite via email participate online study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An online survey use assess outcomes conservative surgical therapy use carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) patient diagnosis inherit neuropathy CMT HNPP ( Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Hereditary Neuropathy liability Pressure Palsies respectively ) . HNPP inherit neuropathy allelic CMT1A . This patient report outcome measurement also assess symptom severity functional status relate carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) various type patient inherit neuropathy . The survey incorporate two validated questionnaire evaluation outcomes relate carpal tunnel syndrome . The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) specific carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . The Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire less specific CTS show equal validity assessment outcomes CTS . The relative non-specificity DASH CTS useful assess possible contribution CMT overall upper extremity symptom severity functional outcome . Data collect participant diagnosis therapy CTS compare data collect participant diagnosis therapy CTS . Furthermore , study incorporate component CMTNS ass extent CMT disease participant . It propose retrospective analysis patient CMT symptom upper extremity suggestive carpal tunnel syndrome . Two validated questionnaire explore change symptoms functional status ( BCTQ DASH ) use evaluate outcomes patient report symptoms diagnosis carpal tunnel syndrome . The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) 19 item scale develop specifically carpal tunnel syndrome consist 11 question assess symptom severity 8 question assess functional status . BCTQ establish test-retest reliability good Pearson 's correlation score re-test ( 0.91 symptom severity component 0.93 functional status component test ) . High internal consistency also report BCTQ ( 0.88-9.92 ) . Convergent validity demonstrate high correlation pre- postoperative BCTQ score physical measure grip , key pinch three-jaw pinch . Responsiveness BCTQ carpal tunnel surgery demonstrate randomized clinical trial setting . BCTQ also report 2-4 time responsive clinical improvement comparison measure neuromuscular impairment . High response rate report BCTQ 80-93 % 6-12 week follow-up 67-93 % 6-12 month follow-up carpal tunnel release . Response rate remain high 85 % 2 year follow-up . Mailed follow-up response rate 69 % report mean follow-up 4.8 year . The mean time complete BCTQ report 5.6 minute . There data indicate precision BCTQ relation carpal tunnel syndrome . The Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire 30 item scale ass symptoms physical function . This questionnaire specific carpal tunnel use variety disorder affect upper limb . DASH intend measure disability emphasis upper extremity activity . The test-retest reliability DASH demonstrate Pearson 's 8 correlation 0.9 group patient carpal tunnel syndrome . The validity DASH demonstrate correlation BCTQ . Pre- postoperative DASH score also correlate physical measure grip , key pinch three-jaw pinch . Responsiveness improved DASH score demonstrate three six month post-surgery follow-up . BCTQ find responsive DASH carpal tunnel syndrome . Postal mail response rate show 80-93 % 6-12 week 66-98 % 6 month carpal tunnel release . The mean time complete DASH report 6.8 minute . There data indicate precision DASH relation carpal tunnel syndrome . The survey data store Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network 's Data Management Coordinating Center ( DMCC ) University South Florida . Names personal health information collect . Upon conclusion study period , data send Dr. Michael Shy , principal investigator Inherited Neuropathies Consortium . Deidentified data send database Genotypes Phenotypes ( dbGaP ) .</detailed_description>
