	<detailed_description>Objectives The broad objective multicenter multidisciplinary observational cohort study investigate patient , provider , system-related factor associate quality safety initial management suspect ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) evolve less 12 hour daily practice . The finding study help identify area room improvement clinical pathway STEMI patient . The specific aim project : - investigate independent association delivery timely acute reperfusion therapy patient , provider , system-related factor , accord current guideline - ass independent association delivery timely acute reperfusion therapy in-hospital clinical outcome ( include all-cause mortality major adverse cardiovascular event ) - determine independent risk factor major bleeding ( exclude coronary-artery bypass graft-related bleeding event ) among baseline patient provider characteristic , process care , system-related factor , respectively - elucidate prevalence , risk factor , in-hospital clinical outcome independently associate false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy - determine hospital interconnect transfer patient suspect STEMI Hypotheses The primary hypothesis guide project delay reperfusion therapy suspect STEMI independently relate provider practice pattern system barrier . It postulate non-compliance target delay implement primary PCI fibrinolytic therapy associate bad in-hospital clinical outcome . The secondary hypothesis delivery acute reperfusion therapy within target delay associate increased rate false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation , inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy , bleed event . Participating study center set The project conduct 3 emergency medical service ( EMS/SAMU ) 23 public private ( for-profit non-for-profit ) acute care hospital Northern Alps France . Northern Alps predominantly mountainous area cover 15,000 km² estimate population 1,860,000 inhabitant large seasonal variation due tourism . The median distance driving time community hospital close PCI center 63 km ( range , 4.5-132 km ) 43 min ( range , 10-88 min ) , respectively . As part coordinate regional system reperfusion therapy STEMI , participate center long collaborative tradition STEMI management research.The rationale , data collection method , verification procedure , primary outcome registry report detail elsewhere . Baseline data collection method 1 . Prospective data collection As part ongoing registry , attend physician clinical research technician routinely abstract summary information demographic , present characteristic ( include electrocardiographic finding ) , coronary angiography finding , delivery timing acute reperfusion therapy prehospital hospital setting . Based patient home address , travel time travel distance near community hospital PCI-capable hospital obtain call commercial Web page ( MapQuest Via Michelin ) . ZIP code replace patient home address unavailable . Previous study show method provide reasonable estimate . To account peak travel time , slowdowns 20 % factored hour 7 9 AM 4 7 PM , Monday Friday . 2 . Retrospective data collection Two clinical research nurse perform retrospective chart review use computerized data collection instrument . The following variable record : baseline patient characteristic , clinical variable , comorbid condition , laboratory variable , procedural intervention ( cardiac catheterization , PCI [ primary ] , coronary artery bypass graft ) time index hospitalization , medication ( admission , first 24 hour , discharge ) . Index hospitalization include admit transfer hospital stay . Characteristics also collect attend physician ( gender , age , discipline ) well admit transfer hospital ( community vs PCI-capable facility , size , public non profit versus profit ) . Consistent previous study , PCI center define hospital offer emergency PCI 24 h day , 7 day week . Data management 1 . Prospective data collection As part ongoing registry , data prospectively record duplicate standardized form design facilitate data collection entry . All complete form forward core coordinating facility regional emergency system ( RENAU=Réseau Nord-Alpin de Urgences ; www.renau.org ) , data enter electronically ( single-data entry ) maintain local computer network . The data entry screen similar paper form . Original data collection form keep lock file cabinet . Data integrity enforce two complementary approach : - Routine edit check ( valid value , range check , consistency check ) perform time data entry clinical research technician core coordinating facility . - The registry statistician periodically screen data additional error use program design detect miss value inconsistency . 2 . Retrospective data collection To ensure optimal quality , data collect retrospectively chart review enter electronically clinical research nurse use personal identification code password-protected web-based data collection system . The clinical research nurse receive formal training method data abstraction recording . An operation manual include definition acceptable data source variable distribute . Reliability data abstraction assess randomly select 30 case independent collection two study nurse . The data manager screen data additional error use program design detect miss value inconsistency . Statistical analysis 1 . Overview Standard descriptive summary statistic use report continuous categorical variable . In univariate analysis , inferential comparison perform use analysis variance Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test . Logarithm transformation may use highly skewed variable prior inferential comparison . Categorical variable analyze use Khi² Fisher exact test . Trends across ordered group analyze statistical significance use Khi² test trend categorical variable non-parametric Wilcoxon-type test trend continuous variable , respectively . Two-sided P value less 0.05 consider statistically significant . 2 . Primary effectiveness outcome A non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model develop identify baseline characteristic independently associate timely acute reperfusion therapy . Covariates enter multivariable model prespecified modelling , without investigate association primary study outcome . Secondary analysis restrict subset patient prehospital management use multilevel logistic regression , 3 level define patient , mobile intensive care unit , hospital . The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm ( Markov Chain Monte Carlo method ) use account cross-classification mobile intensive care unit transport patient one study site . 3 . Secondary medical outcome Because timely acute reperfusion therapy randomly assign observational study , unadjusted comparison medical outcome study group might confound imbalance baseline characteristics.For purpose , propensity score analysis compensate difference measure baseline characteristic perform timely acute reperfusion therapy recipients non-recipients . Practically , propensity score derive receipt timely acute reperfusion therapy use full non-parsimonious logistic regression model include baseline characteristic covariates . Each patient assign propensity score , may range 0.00 1.00 reflect conditional probability timely acute reperfusion receipt give baseline characteristic . To compare secondary medical outcome among patient similar conditional probability timely acute reperfusion therapy , cohort timely acute reperfusion therapy recipients non-recipients match propensity score also define . For purpose , algorithm use match timely acute reperfusion therapy recipient single non-recipient near propensity score within one digit . If do , timely acute reperfusion therapy recipient exclude propensity-matched analysis . The propensity-matched cohort evaluate significant residual imbalance baseline characteristic . Then logistic regression use estimate odds ratio secondary medical outcome associate receipt timely acute reperfusion therapy among propensity score-matched patient . 4 . Secondary effectiveness outcome Using model approach previously describe ( i.e. , b. primary effectiveness outcome ) , multivariable logistic regression perform identify baseline characteristic independently associate false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation among patient candidate primary PCI . A first-order interaction term involve prehospital cardiac catheterization laboratory activation test statistical significance . If appropriate , analysis stratify accord prehospital versus hospital cardiac catheterization laboratory activation . Then medical outcome compare false positive true positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation adjust quintile propensity score . In separate analysis , multivariate logistic regression perform identify baseline characteristic independently associate inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy among fibrinolysis recipient . A first-order interaction term involve prehospital fibrinolysis test statistical significance , appropriate , analysis stratify accord receipt prehospital versus hospital fibrinolysis . Then odds ratio estimate medical outcome associate inadvertent fibrinolysis adjust quintile propensity score . Harms safety In retrospective observational study , severe adverse event occur hospitalization specify secondary medical study outcome ( mortality , major adverse cardiac event [ reinfarction , cardiogenic shock , cardiac arrest , heart failure , stroke ] , major bleeding ) . Other prespecified adverse event record , include atrial fibrillation flutter , sustain ventricular tachycardia , atrioventricular block ( Mobitz II 3rd degree ) , mechanical complication ( ventricular septal defect , mitral regurgitation , free wall rupture ) , venous thromboembolism ( deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism ) , acute renal failure , thrombocytopenia heparin-induced thrombocytopenia , non-major bleeding event . Adverse event collect structured chart review . There attempt determine potential causality .</detailed_description>
