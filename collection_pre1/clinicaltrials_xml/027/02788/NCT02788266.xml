	<brief_summary>Background : The aim study evaluate treatment multiple gingival recession associate non-carious cervical lesion ( NCCL ) use modify coronally advanced flap combination sub-epithelial connective tissue graft ( SCTG ) restore root surface . Methods : Twenty-three systemically healthy subject , positive presence three cervical lesion associate gingival recession three different adjacent teeth , enrol study . The NCCL restore prior surgery use one three different material : composite resin ( group 1 ) , resin-modified glass ionomer cement ( group 2 ) giomer ( group 3 ) . The defect treat SCTG . Clinical measurement , include plaque index ( PI ) , bleed probe ( BOP ) , relative recession height ( rRH ) , probe depth ( PD ) , cervical lesion height ( CLH ) , relative clinical attachment level ( rCAL ) , keratinize tissue height ( KTH ) , keratinize tissue thickness ( KTT ) , percentage root coverage ( RC ) , percentage cervical lesion height coverage ( CLHC ) record baseline , 3 6 month , 1 year postoperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gingival recession ( GR ) define exposure root surface due displacement gingival margin apical cemento-enamel junction ( CEJ ) . Problems related gingival recession dentin hypersensitivity , bacterial plaque accumulation , difficulty maintain oral health care aesthetic , root caries abrasion fear lose teeth6 . Coronally advance flap ( CAF ) effective periodontal plastic surgical procedure treatment gingival recession . The CAF subepithelial connective tissue graft ( CAF+ SCTG ) technique report gold standard enhance probability achieve complete root coverage . Various dental material surgical approach use manage gingival recession associate cervical lesion predictable combined surgical/restorative treatment.Restorative material must biocompatible minimize adverse effect periodontal tissue induce direct contact.Resin composite resin modify glass ionomer cement commonly use restore cervical lesions.Resin-ionomer material many property biocompatibility soft hard tissue display high marginal adaptation minimal surface roughness well allow use successfully subgingival region . Composite resin material many advantage include aesthetic surface characteristic term finish polishing . It report well-adapted finished composite resins seem adverse effect periodontal margin . It also report age composite resin restoration may produce gingival inflammation subgingival area . Fluoride-releasing resin material pre-reacted glass ( PRG ) , call giomer , suggest good color matching , biocompatibility , smooth surface finish , fluoride release fluoride recharge potential . It report randomized-controlled clinical trial use CTG treatment root surface restore giomer effective 6-month period without noxious effect periodontal tissue . Therefore , aim study evaluate clinically treatment gingival recession associate NCCL resin modify glass ionomer cement ( RMGI ) nano-filled resin composite ( NRC ) giomer plus SCTG first year follow surgery .</detailed_description>
