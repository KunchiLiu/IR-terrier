	<brief_summary>A randomized phase II trial ass efficacy safety selective metabolically adaptive radiation dose escalation locally advance non-small cell lung cancer receive definitive chemoradiotherapy . Eligible consent patient randomize receive conventional chemoradiotherapy chemoradiotherapy radiation ( RT ) integrate boost . All patient receive fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) scan within two week prior start treatment . The primary outcome determine dose escalation metabolically active tumor subvolumes reduce local-regional failure rate 2 year .</brief_summary>
