	<brief_summary>This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , phase II trial nab-paclitaxel without mifepristone advance , glucocorticoid receptor-positive , triple-negative breast cancer . A total 64 patient receive nab-paclitaxel . Patients randomly assign either receive placebo receive mifepristone daily day prior day dose nab-paclitaxel . Patients enrol 12 month follow 12 month follow completion study . To expand follow investigator understand potential PK interaction nab-paclitaxel mifepristone , investigator perform PK study first 20 patient enrol pre-specified `` PK site '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel ( Nab-Paclitaxel , Abraxane® ) With Without Mifepristone Advanced , Glucocorticoid Receptor-Positive , Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To compare progression free survival ( PFS ) patient treat nab-paclitaxel + placebo patient treat nab-paclitaxel + mifepristone . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To correlate percentage glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) positivity recent metastatic tumor biopsy ( primary tumor primary tumor available ) PFS mifepristone placebo group . 2 . To perform exploratory assessment overall response rate group . 3 . To collect information regard overall survival treatment cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer stage IV unresectable stage III disease . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . To consider pathologically enlarge measurable , lymph node must ≥15 mm short axis assess CT scan ( CT scan slice thickness recommend great 5 mm ) . 3 . Triplenegative breast cancer ( define ER PR &lt; 10 % positive ; HER2 01+ IHC FISH ratio &lt; 2.0 ) 4 . Patients must tumor block slide available testing , tumor must glucocorticoid receptor positive ( defined GR &gt; 10 % moderate strong stain central lab ) . A formalinfixed , paraffinembedded surgical core needle biopsy obtain primary tumor metastasis contain viable tumor tissue require evaluation . Fine needle aspirate alternative cytology sample acceptable . 5 . Patients may receive adjuvant chemotherapy two prior chemotherapy metastatic locally recurrent disease . No prior nabpaclitaxel mifepristone therapy metastatic disease allow . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use NabPaclitaxel combination Mifepristone patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . 7 . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % ) . 8 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3 . platelet ≥100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 X ULN &lt; 5 X ULN bone mets present AST ALT &lt; 2.5 ULN &lt; 5 X ULN liver mets present adequate renal function : creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . INR &lt; 1.5 9 . Females childbearing potential ( define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month prior study enrollment ) must : Commit abstinence heterosexual contact agree use effective contraception without interruption begin least 28 day prior start protocol therapy , study medication , 6 month follow last dose therapy . Have negative serum pregnancy test result screen . 10 . Male subject must practice abstinence agree use condom sexual contact pregnant female female childbearing potential participating study , dose interruption 6 month follow protocol discontinuation , even undergone successful vasectomy . 11 . Patients must &lt; Grade 2 preexist peripheral neuropathy ( per CTCAE ) . 12 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients receive investigational agent . 2 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 3 . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy free disease ≥ 3 year . 4 . Patients know brain metastasis eligible long complete radiation brain , corticosteroid therapy least 7 day . 5 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition mifepristone paclitaxel/nabpaclitaxel . Patients history mild infusion reaction paclitaxel able continue receive paclitaxel corticosteroid premedication eligible participate , case likely related cremaphor paclitaxel . 6 . Mifepristone inhibit CYP3A4 induce CYP3A4 . Addition mifepristone preexist drug regimen may cause mild temporary increase plasma drug concentration drug significant CYP3A4 metabolism . Medications strong inducer CYP3A4 carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , primidone , rifabutin , rifampin , rifapentine , St. John 's Wort may decrease plasma mifepristone level . Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor medication expect cause large increase plasma mifepristone concentration . Mifepristone may increase plasma drug concentration concomitant medication metabolism mediate CYP2C9/CYP2C8 . Drugs large increase whose metabolism largely solely mediated CYP2C9/2C8 include : Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) warfarin . 7 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 8 . Pregnant woman exclude study Mifepristone abortifacient agent potential teratogenic effect . 9 . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Mifepristone , breastfeed discontinue mother wish participate study . 10 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Mifepristone . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 11 . No history longterm use corticosteroid concurrent short term use corticosteroid allow .</criteria>
