	<brief_summary>A single-centre triple-blind study look addition NAC tumescent solution liposuction fat graft healthy patient volunteer already undergo bilateral breast reduction . Three-dimensional reconstruction volumetric analysis perform base CT scan 0 , 1 3 month histological analysis perform fat graft explantation 3 month determine fat graft vascularity quality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autologous fat graft increasingly popular technique soft tissue reconstruction ; however , surgical technique limit inconsistent graft take , undercorrection , requirement repeat procedure . The author previously examine whether widely available , clinically safe anti-oxidant , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , could improve adipose-derived stem cell survival subsequent graft take add tumescent solution time fat harvest mouse . The addition NAC tumescent fluid fat harvest mouse protect ADSCs oxidative stress , increase survival proliferation , inhibit early differentiation mature adipocytes vitro . In vivo model , NAC treatment time harvest improve survival quality autologous fat graft . These observation provide proof-of-principle use NAC clinical setting optimize fat graft yield . Hypothesis : The addition NAC tumescent solution use fat graft improve fat graft survival human potentially decrease amount re-operations undercorrection occur . Plan : The study conduct single-centre , randomize , triple-blind placebo-controlled trial perform QEII Health Sciences Centre , Halifax , Nova Scotia . Subjects choose healthy female patient already present operate room elective breast reduction surgery . These patient enrol book surgery present clinic expedite receive elective surgery enrol study . Each subject serve control . The hypothesis test perform lipoaspiration thigh/hip region healthy patient addition tumescent solution without NAC . Approximately 10 millilitre fat graft inject pre-tibial area depend randomization allocation , describe Kolle et al . ( 1 ) The volume fat graft measure 0 , 1 3 month use compute tomographic ( CT ) scan accord institutional standard . The CT image export Materialise Interactive Medical Image Control System ( MIMICS ) volumetric three-dimensional reconstruction make measure size volume graft time point . The graft explanted 3 month weigh . The histologic appearance , grade amount inflammation , cysts/vacuoles , integrity vascularity CD31 staining assess . The result compare use two-tailed t-tests . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
