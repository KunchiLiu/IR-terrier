	<brief_title>Durvalumab With Without Tremelimumab Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Durvalumab new type drug many type cancer . Laboratory test show work allow immune system detect cancer stimulate immune response . This may help slow growth cancer may cause cancer cell die . Durvalumab show shrink tumour animal study nearly 2000 people seem promise clear offer well result standard treatment alone . Tremelimumab new type drug various type cancer . It work similar way durvalumab may improve effect durvalumab . This may also help slow growth cancer cell may cause cancer cell die . Tremelimumab show shrink tumour animal study nearly 1500 people seem promise clear offer well result standard treatment alone use durvalumab Combinations durvalumab tremelimumab also study combined show increase tumour shrinkage animal compare either drug alone . While combination study 217 people , clear offer well result standard treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate castrate resistant . Disease progression define one following : PSA Progression : A rise PSA 2 subsequent rise reference value ( necessarily consecutively ) , measure minimum one week apart . The PSA confirm progression must value ≥ 2 ng/ml . OR Objective Progression ( RECIST 1.1 ) Patients must surgically medically castrate , testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/dL ( &lt; 1.7 nM ) . Patients undergone orchiectomy must continue ( restart previously discontinue ) LHRH therapy throughout study . All patient must tumour block primary metastatic tumour available consent release block/recently cut slide correlative analysis centre/pathologist must agree submission specimen ( ) . The site plan biopsy must measurable lesion . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization ( within 35 day negative ) . All patient must least one measurable lesion define RECIST 1.1 site protocol mandate biopsy . The criterion define measurable disease follow : CT scan ( slice thickness 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm &gt; long diameter ; Lymph nod CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; measure short axis Patients must ≥ 18 year age . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Prior Therapy Systemic Therapy : Patients may receive prior docetaxel chemotherapy . Hormonal Therapy : Patients must castrate resistant . Have failed/progressed prior abiraterone and/or enzalutamide . Patients must discontinue antiandrogens least 4 week prior study entry ( least 6 week bicalutamide ) . Other therapy : Prior treatment agent , tyrosine kinase target agent permissible . Immunotherapy : Patients may receive prior immunotherapy ; vaccine treatment oncolytic virus permissible . Patients must recover reversible toxicity relate prior systemic therapy ( chemotherapy hormone ) adequate washout follow : Longest one follow : Two week ; 5 halflives investigational agent ; Standard cycle length standard therapy . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation radium223 permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse last dose radiation date randomization . Exceptions may make lowdose nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation CCTG . Concurrent radiotherapy permit . Prior Surgery : Prior major surgery permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse major surgery date randomization , wound heal occur . Laboratory Requirements ( Must do within 7 day prior randomization ) : Abs Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ≤ 5.0 ULN ( patient liver mets ) Serum Creatinine &lt; 1.25 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 40mL/min Nonsterilized male patient sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide study 6 month last dose durvalumab tremelimumab , 3 month last dose durvalumab alone . Female partner male subject must use highly effective method contraception throughout period . Male patient also refrain donate sperm study 6 month last dose durvalumab tremelimumab 3 month last dose durvalumab alone . Subjects donate blood participate study , least 90 day follow last infusion durvalumab tremelimumab . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . Patients history malignancy require concurrent anticancer therapy . Patients brain metastasis eligible . Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder ( include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis exception diverticulosis , celiac disease serious gastrointestinal chronic condition associate diarrhea ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sarcoidosis syndrome , Wegener syndrome ( granulomatosis polyangiitis ) , rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc. , within past 3 year prior start treatment . The following exception criterion : Patients alopecia . Patients Grave 's disease , vitiligo psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within last 2 year ) . Patients hypothyroidism ( e.g . follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement . History primary immunodeficiency , history allogenic organ transplant require therapeutic immunosuppression use immunosuppressive agent within 28 day randomization* prior history severe ( grade 3 4 ) immune mediate toxicity immune therapy grade ≥ 3 infusion reaction . * NOTE : Intranasal/inhaled corticosteroid systemic steroid exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent dose alternative corticosteroid permissible . Live attenuate vaccination administer within 30 day prior randomization within 30 day receive durvalumab . History hypersensitivity durvalumab tremelimumab excipient . Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab antiCTLA4 , include tremelimumab . Patients experience untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) . Patients significant cardiac history , even control , LVEF ≥ 50 % . Concurrent treatment investigational drug anticancer therapy ( except LHRH patient surgically castrate ) . Patients serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . This include limited : History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement . Active infection require systemic therapy ; ( include patient know active hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) tuberculosis infection require systemic therapy ) . Active peptic ulcer disease gastritis .</criteria>
