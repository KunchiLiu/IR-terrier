	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Historically , respiratory insufficiency respiratory failure frequent source morbidity mortality premature neonate . Intubation invasive mechanical ventilation life-saving therapy many patient , without risk . These risk include pulmonary complication volutrauma , extrapulmonary air leak syndrome , traumatic injury large airway ; non-pulmonary complication retinopathy prematurity ; long-term complication bronchopulmonary dysplasia [ Miller , Badiee ] . Concern effect prolong mechanical ventilation lead development non-invasive form respiratory support . Non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) frequently use modality respiratory support premature neonates set respiratory insufficiency recent wean invasive ventilation . Synchronized NIV effective decrease respiratory effort compare unsynchronized NIV nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) [ Chang ] . Synchronizing NIV premature neonates patient 's respiratory effort difficult large air leak , weak inspiratory effort , high respiratory rate inherent population [ Vignaux ] . A novel method synchronization , neurally adjust ventilatory assist ( NAVA ) use electrodes functional naso/orogastric tube ( Edi catheter ) detect diaphragm contraction time onset , duration , peak inspiratory pressure support breaths electrical activity diaphragm ( Edi ) [ Sinderby ] . NAVA use invasive non-invasive ventilation modality , several small study examine invasive NAVA child adult [ Stein , de la Olivia ] . Fewer study examine NIV NAVA population , two clinical trial examine NIV NAVA premature neonates [ Beck , Lee ] . Beck colleague Canada show feasibility preservation synchrony NIV NAVA premature neonates [ Beck ] . Lee colleague Korea show few asynchrony event , low trigger delay , low peak inspiratory pressure NIV NAVA compare non-invasive pressure support ventilation premature neonates [ Lee ] . Neither study examine work breathing ( WOB ) preterm neonate ventilate NIV NAVA . Work breathe assist ventilation portion drive pressure ventilation contribute patient 's respiratory muscle . A research team Arkansas Children 's Hospital able demonstrate NAVA achieve reduce response time , work breathing , asynchrony neurally trigger breath compare pneumatically trigger breath animal model [ Heulitt ] . This team also able show similar result clinical study intubate pediatric patient bronchiolitis [ Clement ] . A recently complete study institution look work breathe neonatal pig compare NIV NAVA unsynchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ( NIPPV ) mode currently use hospital . Using pressure-time product ( PTP ) measure WOB study able show WOB low NAVA . The PTP reliably use infant NIV nasal prong interface allow large air leak nose mouth , interfere accurate measurement . Thoracoabdominal asynchrony ( TAA ) important correlate WOB increase respiratory load preterm infant measure without invasive monitoring . TAA measure use respiratory inductance plethysmography ( RIP ) band around patient 's chest abdomen quantify chest wall abdominal movement . The degree asynchrony two compartment reflect phase angle ( θ ) , calculate RIP band measurement . This study examine estimate WOB population premature neonates respiratory insufficiency currently non-invasive support . Infants serve control study NIV NAVA NIPPV . Order assignment randomize . Researchers use RIP band measure thoracic abdominal movement , calculate phase angle ( θ ) estimate WOB . Study personnel measure respiratory parameter correlate ventilation gas exchange include follow : tidal volume ( arbitrary unit , AU ) , minute ventilation ( AU/min ) , respiratory rate , transcutaneous oxygen carbon dioxide , oxygen saturation FiO2 requirement , peak inspiratory pressure , delivered end expiratory pressure . Investigators also evaluate measure breathe asynchrony include trigger delay ( time initial increase Edi signal initiation deliver ventilator flow ) asynchrony index ( number asynchrony event divide total event , percent ) . Study Design/Procedures/Population : Fifteen premature neonates 1-2 kilogram current weight , gestational age birth 24-34 week , receive non-invasive ventilation enrol study . Inclusion criterion follow : respiratory insufficiency currently require non-invasive ventilation ( either NIPPV NAVA ) , current FiO2 requirement less 0.40 , clinical stability . Exclusion criterion follow : ionotropic support , clinical instability ( temperature instability , heart failure , bleeding , active infection , significant apnea bradycardia ) , know major congenital anomaly ( congenital heart disease , abdominal wall defect , gastrointestinal tract defect , cleft palate , neurologic defect ) , know cystic fibrosis , nitric oxide use , cyanotic congenital heart disease . At begin study , RIP band place around infant 's chest abdomen . An Edi catheter place current gastric catheter may may remove . Infants ventilate Servo ventilator equip NIV NAVA software { Maquet , Solna , Sweden } . Data continuously simultaneously acquire use MP100 Biopac data acquisition system . Data acquire follow : heart rate , oxygen saturation , transcutaneous CO2 O2 , PIP , PEEP , rib cage abdominal RIP signal , sum tidal volume , Edi . Infants receive 15 minute trial NIV NAVA NIPPV random order first 10 minute change consider washout period last 5 minute use data collection . The data record two RIP band used calculate phase angle ( θ ) estimate WOB . Risks Benefits : Infants often gag may vomit gastric tube , NAVA catheter , remove replace . Rarely , patient could gastric tube go place besides stomach coil esophagus . Researchers able detect occur use placement screen ventilator NAVA catheter electrode detect electrical activity heart diaphragm , use determine location . In extremely low birth weight infant , transcutaneous monitor ( TCOMs ) cause skin burning . These effect see large baby like include study . There small risk loss confidentiality inherent research . Investigators everything possible protect participant ' confidentiality . There may may direct medical benefit infant involve study . The infant continuous carbon dioxide oxygen monitor study patient problem , study personnel able detect respond quickly . If patient show improvement use NAVA , investigator may able suggest treatment team mode continue . If use NAVA improve work breathe baby , researcher hope information learn study benefit infant need respiratory support future . Data Handling/Recordkeeping : The principal investigator carefully monitor study procedure protect safety research subject , quality data integrity study . Each patient assign unique identify code number . The key code keep lock file principal investigator 's office . Only principal investigator co-investigators access code information identifies subject study . Data Analysis : The primary hypothesis phase angle ( θ ) use respiratory inductance plethysmography decrease use NAVA comparison NIPPV study sample . Data collect checked outlier extreme value , well distributional assumption parametric statistical test . Repeated measure ANOVA use compare primary secondary outcome two ventilation method assumption meet . When significant deviation assumption encounter , nonparametric alternative use . Statistical analysis perform use Stata ( College Station , TX ) statistical software . Sample Size , Power Calculation : Investigators plan recruit 15-20 neonate 24-34 week gestation respiratory insufficiency . Based result animal model , 30 % reduction primary outcome expect . Since average phase angle find variable among preterm infant ( range 2.8-162.9 ) , several scenario sample size power calculation present analysis [ Ulm ] . A sample size 15 neonate achieve 82 % power detect 30 % change primary outcome estimate standard deviation difference 18.8 , 37.5 , 56.3 respectively average phase angle 50 , 100 , 150 degree use NIPPV . All calculation assume significance level 0.05 use two-sided paired t-test .
