	<brief_title>Protein Recommendation Increase Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe muscle depletion ( sarcopenia ) common issue among cancer patient adequate nutrient intake pivotal maintain muscle mass . Yet , optimal amount protein undefined prevent treat sarcopenia people cancer methodological approach assess protein requirement expensive , burdensome unfeasible population . This study 's overarch goal investigate efficacy diet different protein content : 1 ) muscle mass maintenance ( primary endpoint ) ; 2 ) improvement physical function cancer patient capable oral nutrition support . Additional study measurement include : energy metabolism ( include total body ) , body composition use multi-compartment model , blood biomarkers , tolerance treatment , quality life overall prognosis . In randomized control trial approach , employ high protein feeding ( 2 g/kg/d , n=18 ) versus standard recommendation ( 1 g/kg/d , n=18 ) patient newly diagnose colorectal cancer 12 week . Prescribed energy intake frame amount calorie meet energy need support protein synthesis , prevent fat mass gain . Carbohydrate , fat protein intake adjust throughout intervention achieve desire rate amount energy protein intake . An oral protein powder supplement make high-quality whey protein , well portion pre-cooked meat provide participant help increase protein intake need . A multivitamin give participant throughout study . Participants receive weekly call study coordinator ensure adherence dietary intervention .</detailed_description>
