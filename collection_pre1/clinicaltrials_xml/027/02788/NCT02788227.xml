	<brief_summary>Background : The Ebola virus cause severe disease . It fatal . The usual incubation period expose 2 21 day . There approved treatment Ebola infection . There also vaccine prevent infection either exposure . Researchers want test Ebola vaccine . They want give people expose virus order prevent disease . Objectives : To see long-lasting effective vaccine rVSV [ delta ] G ZEBOV-GP ( V920 ) prevent Ebola . Eligibility : Healthy adult risk exposure Ebola virus work lab clinical contact . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . Participants get study vaccine . It inject upper arm . Participants monitor closely least 30 minute . They get diary card record symptoms vaccine 14 day . Participants study visit 1 , 3 , 6 month get vaccine , every 6 month ( , month 12 , 18 , 19 , 24 , 30 , 36 study ) total 36 month . Eighteen month join study , participant randomly assign one two group . One group get second ( booster ) dose vaccine . The group get second dose . This study last 36 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Vaccine Ebola-Zaire ( rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP ) Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PREP ) People Potential Occupational Risk Ebola Virus Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 1994 present , multiple Ebolavirus outbreak affect mostly central Africa . However , 2014/2015 West African outbreak significantly exceed previous outbreak geographic range , number individual affect , disruption typical activity civil society . This protocol multi-center study evaluate durability immune response follow open label administration investigational rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine ( V920 ) pre-exposure prophylaxis adult occupational risk potential exposure Ebola virus . The vaccine us live replicate vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) replace gene encode G envelope glycoprotein gene encode envelope glycoprotein Zaire strain Ebola ( rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP also know V920 ) . All subject receive single dose rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP ( 2 x 10^7 pfu ) Day 0 . We collect adverse event vaccination Month 1 Month 19 , serious adverse event ( SAE ) duration study , assess immune response Months 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 19 , 24 , 30 , 36 . A single booster immunization dose study vaccine primary dose ( 2 x 10^7 pfu/mL ) give randomized month 18 booster arm trial . However , time observation period antibody level fall predefined seroprotective threshold ( yet define parallel newly plan study ) , booster offer previously receive booster injection .</detailed_description>
