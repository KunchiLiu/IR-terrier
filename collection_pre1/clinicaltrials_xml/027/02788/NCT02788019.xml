	<brief_summary>This randomized noninferiority interventional study determine equivalence two adductor canal block ( ACB ) method : mid-thigh distal thigh patient undergo medial foot , medial ankle , medial leg surgery . Sixty eight patient identify orthopedic presurgical clinic visit , anesthesia preoperative clinic visit Day Surgery Unit ( Zale Lipshy Hospital , Clements University Hospital , UTSW Outpatient Surgery Center ) eligibility . Eligible individual may introduce study orthopedic presurgical clinic anesthesia preoperative clinic staff . After consent patient randomize ( break-seal method ) receive either mid-thigh distal thigh block use ropivacaine prior foot , ankle , leg surgery . The following measurement obtain determine change sensory distribution : pinprick test Neuropen , maximum voluntary isometric contraction block , postoperative pain score ( 24 hrs discharge ) postoperative opiate consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential subject identify orthopedic presurgical clinic , anesthesia preoperative clinic Day Surgery Unit . The electronic medical record ( Epic ) also use prescreening potential subject . Recruitment consent occur anesthesia preoperative clinic , Day Surgery Unit . A computer generate randomization list use randomization list . The research intervention study take place within standard clinical context . The patient receive ACB regardless participation research accordance anesthetic plan desire The experiment conduct follow : A 20-point grid drawn subject 's leg receive medial foot , ankle leg surgery . Two baseline measurement take prior administration adductor block : distribution sensation use pinprick ( Neuropen ) method , muscle contraction strength use dynamometer . The number grid cell sensation count record . The randomized block administer allow 20 minute anesthetic take full effect . Post-block measurement include pinprick grid cell , patient indicate whether sensation felt . The cell sensation perceive circled number cell record . After sensation record , maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) measure dynanometer record maximal contraction strength . Within 24 hour surgery , subject ask rate pain scale 0-10 , record discharge , conjunction opiate require reduce pain . A detailed explanation experimental step read . 20-Point Grid : The 20-point grid mark start anatomical landmark knee joint : medial inter-knee joint tibia meet femur , mid medial patella , mid lateral patella , along line semitendinosus tendon 5 cm posterior point . Then 5 cm interval plot progress cephalad total 15 cm . Neuropen test : Prior administration randomize blockade technique pinprick test administer use Neuropen scale 0-1 , 1-normal sharp sensation 0=dull change sensation . Mechanical stimulation pinprick test routinely use test nociception bedside neurologic examination . Sharpness consider surrogate nociception whereas sharpness necessarily painful , mechanical threshold sharpness closely parallel pain . The subject ask determine whether stimulus feel sharp . The number grid-points change sensation baseline record baseline 20 minute block . MVIC : Additionally , MVIC measure handheld dynamometer ( Lafayette Instrument Company , Lafayette Indiana ) determine muscle strength baseline adductor block . The patient seat position thigh parallel floor knee 90-degree angle foot floor . The dynamometer apply leg 5 cm transmalleolar axis perpendicular tibial crest . The patient instruct extend leg knee sustain maximal force 5 second . This repeat 3 time 30 second rest movement , force record ( Newtons ) . Adductor Canal Blockade The adductor canal block perform use linear HFL38xp linear HFL38x ultrasound probe ( X-Porte M-Turbo ; SonoSite ; Bothell , Washington ) . The site receive ACB sterilize chlorhexidine gluconate 2 % 70 % isopropyl alcohol prep . A skin weal lidocaine 1 % ( 2-5mL ) deliver . A Tuohy needle ( 17 gauge ) insert skin wheal ultrasound guidance towards target nerve location . Ropivacaine 0.5 % 15ml inject either adductor canal locations.27 Pain Scores Opiate Consumption A follow-up visit perform person inpatient via phone outpatient within 24 hour discharge assess pain control , monitor side effect . It take 10 minute . Adverse event monitor 24-hour period study . Potential Risks Potential risk include loss confidentiality mild discomfort associate pinprick sensory test . Risks involved administration ropivacaine primarily damage surround tissue , include nerve , may cause bleed infection injection unknown allergy ropivicaine develop administration drug . There additional physical psychological risk may result participation research protocol since patient determine desire perineural blockade study inclusion even propose . Subject Safety Data Monitoring Any serious adverse reaction , include allergy local anesthetic systemic toxicity , result immediate discontinuation study related procedure treatment necessary . Serious adverse event report Institutional Review Board . The data already obtain participant serious adverse event analyze accord intention-to-treat principle . If non-inferiority two neurosensory blockade technique significantly detect 50 % enrollment ( enrollment 34 patient ) , study stop . The study also stop event overwhelm statistical evidence interim analysis two block different , small chance multiple adverse event study population .</detailed_description>
