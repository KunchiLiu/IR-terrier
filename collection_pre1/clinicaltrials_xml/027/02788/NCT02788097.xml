	<detailed_description>During first 20 year IVF embryo transfer perform day 1 3 , even though evidence suggest embryos dispel uterus fallopian tube post-compaction stage . This meant initially embryo transfer asynchronous transfer . This strategy impose upon IVF vitro culture condition time , sub-optimal normal rate blastocyst development . Transferred asynchronously cleavage stage embryos adapt `` alien '' non- physio-metabolic condition may result embryonic stress compromise embryo development . In fresh embryo transfer exacerbate supraphysiological hormone effect control ovarian stimulation . In addition , mechanical factor ( i.e . uterine contractility ) time factor , related endometrium ( i.e. , window implantation ) embryo ( i.e. , time hatch ) , may reduce chance implantation . In contrast , mammalian specie transfer cleavage stage embryos human uterus lead acceptable level pregnancy live birth . The regulation synchrony embryo endometrium fully address clinically human . This limitation affect IVF significantly 30 % embryo transfer may affect endometrial receptivity factor . The endometrium highly specialized , hormonally regulate tissue receptive embryo communication/interaction self-limiting period refer window implantation . Currently , way non-invasively determine time optimal receptivity , IVF transfer perform assumption WOI sufficiently wide enough accommodate implantation patient treatment . During period , endometrial epithelium acquire optimal receptivity progress specific structural , functional , morphological change induce pre-ovulatory estrogen progesterone post-ovulatory progesterone , LH , hCG . During last three decade , major increase understand embryo physiology correspondingly major improvement vitro culture technology use , particular culture medium incubator technology . These improvement result culture good quality cleavage stage embryos consequently blastocyst extend culture , increase embryo utility pregnancy capacity cycle . The increased implantation rate obtain blastocyst transfer may much embryo quality stage , i.e. , blastocyst require bi-directional communication competency need implantation , WOI , i.e. , time blastocyst formation transfer coincide WOI endometrium . Moreover , presently improve culture condition may also change traditional embryo developmental milestone , particular , time blastulation may decrease . An increase number blastocyst form day 4 culture - Â±100 hour post-insemination . Traditionally , day 4 embryo assess evidence compaction , developmental stage lead blastulation cell differentiation . Zygotes embryos reach developmental milestone first ( i.e. , syngamy , early cleavage , early compaction early blastulation ) generally believe increased chance normal developmental potential . In recent artificial frozen embryo transfer ( FET ) blastocyst vitrify day 4 culture transfer P+4 , blastocysts traditionally transfer P+5 , high rate implantation observe . In addition , great number implantation result clinical pregnancy ( i.e. , conceptus normal fetal heart activity ) . In prospective randomise control study , investigator investigate whether increase viability , due either embryo quality , endometrial receptivity , combination two factor randomize transfer day 5 blastocyst P+4 P+5 .</detailed_description>
