	<brief_summary>Background : Advanced urothelial cancer cure . But chemotherapy drug test . The Co-eXpression ExtrapolatioN ( COXEN ) model predict cell respond treatment . It may also help determine drug fight urothelial cancer base characteristic tumor . Researchers want test model choose best therapy advance urothelial cancer within 3 week tumor respond next best therapy . Objective : To test COXEN model choose best therapy advance urothelial cancer within 3 week . Eligibility : People age 18 old whose urothelial cancer spread least 1 line chemotherapy Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test , tumor scan . Participants provide tumor sample previous surgery new biopsy . A needle remove small piece tumor . Participants repeat screen test , plus EKG scan . For scan , get injection radioactive drug . They lie machine take picture . Participants take drug assign COXEN model . They visit every 2 3 week . These include blood urine test . Participants tumor scan every 8 9 week . Participants may another biopsy . Participants take drug tolerate side effect cancer worsens . They may assign second COXEN therapy . Participants follow-up visit 4 5 week last drug dose . Participants contact phone every month death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients present de novo metastatic bladder cancer , develop visceral metastatic disease local treatment , incurable currently available therapeutic modality . - Only small number chemotherapeutic agent test single agent activity treatment metastatic urothelial carcinoma . However ( &gt; 100 ) FDA approve anticancer agent yet test disease . - Novel approach development genomic predictor chemosensitivity require clinical trial identification urgently need order identify agent clinically effective either repurposed discover de novo specifically urothelial carcinoma . Such repurposing FDA approve anticancer agent order advance therapy one cancer another would require minimal clinical development , save billion dollar reduce time require reach routine clinical practice . - Our establish extramural-intramural NCI collaboration pull together significant expertise biomarker development clinical trial design bladder cancer . The innovation group lie novel scientific approach i.e . CoeXpression ExtrapolatioN ( COXEN ) investigation , also successful creation cohesive multi-institutional research collaboration dedicate improved clinical outcome bladder cancer patient . - COXEN us molecular profile Rosetta Stone translate drug sensitivity one set cancer prediction another completely independent set cell line human tumor . The COXEN methodology scrutinize deem methodologically sound peer review . The ability COXEN predict drug effectiveness patient priori , purely vitro assay , unique tool currently either practice development provide similar result . Objectives : - To determine feasibility use Co-eXpression ExtrapolatioN ( COXEN ) model make real-time treatment decision ( within 3 week ) patient advanced urothelial carcinoma . Eligibility : - Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic , progressive urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . - Patients must progressive metastatic disease define new progressive lesion cross-sectional imaging . - Patients must least : - One measurable site disease ( accord RECIST criterion ) - Or , appearance one new bone lesion - Patients must previously treat , define treatment least one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen agent . Patients may receive number prior cytotoxic agent . - Archival tumor tissue must available enrollment . - Tumor amenable biopsy mandatory study . - 18 year age old - ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) Design : - This pilot single-arm , open-label study use COXEN score select best next therapy list 75 FDA anti-neoplastic drug , patient metastatic bladder cancer progress despite treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy . Combinations list agent may also utilize provide phase 1 data available . - The COXEN algorithm require multi-step process ( pathology , tissue processing , mRNA profiling , bioinformatics , etc . ) potentially labor intensive time intensive . - Given disease state patient eligible protocol , use algorithm select treatment would worthwhile process undertake demonstrate high fraction patient likely obtain benefit procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic , progressive urothelial carcinoma bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . Patients must progressive metastatic disease define new progressive lesion crosssectional imaging . Patients must least : One measurable site disease ( accord RECIST criterion ) , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) equal 20 mm conventional technique less equal 10 mm spiral CT scan . Or , appearance one new bone lesion Patients must previously treat least one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen agent . Patients may receive number prior cytotoxic agent . Archival tumor tissue must available enrollment . Tumor amenable biopsy mandatory study . Age equal 18 year . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky equal 60 % , ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : hemoglobin equal 9 g/dL leukocyte equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count equal 1,200/mcL platelet equal 75,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine 1.5 x normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance equal 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 Because many therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy may eligible pharmacokinetic interaction agent use study , stable CART therapy CD4 &gt; 200 viral load undetectable . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The patient receive cytotoxic chemotherapy ( include investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy ) within 3 week biologic agent ( e.g. , cytokine antibody ) within 4 week prior initiation study therapy . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients brain metastasis stable equal 1 year primary surgery radiation exclude . The subject recover baseline CTCAE le equalto Grade 1 toxicity due prior therapy except alopecia nonclinically significant AEs . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients Hepatitis B C positive . Pregnant woman exclude study agent use study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
