	<brief_title>Treat-and-extend Regimen Aflibercept Diabetic Macular Edema ( VIBIM Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacy aflibercept diabetic macular edema demonstrate phase III , VIVID VISTA study . In study , aflibercept inject use fix dose regimen intravitreal injection perform 5 time every 4 week every 8 week . Although efficacy comparable ranibizumab inject every 4 week , continuous visit treatment account quite burden . TER regard alternative regimen may reduce visit treatment number age-related macular degeneration . TER variable dose regimen injection interval adjust base treatment response . The aim study evaluate efficacy TER use aflibercept DME , assess change visual acuity 104 week compare baseline .</detailed_description>
