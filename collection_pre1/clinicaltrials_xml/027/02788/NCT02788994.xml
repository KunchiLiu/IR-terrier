	<brief_summary>This preliminary study establish issue potential investigator propose project , involve recruitment patient without dementia , admit hospital follow hip fracture . The study evaluate result treatment unstable pertrochanteric hip fracture focus soon mobility restore leading independence . These patient would require surgical fixation ( replacement ) hip fracture . The study evaluate two method fixation hip fracture treat either pin ( nail ) insert within cavity thigh bone hip screw plate apply out aspect thigh bone . The data collect study provide information whether one method fixation well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stabilization Fresh Unilateral Unstable Pertrochanteric Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator organise Patient Feedback Session Leeds , comprise patient previously sustain hip fracture underwent surgical fixation ( either cephalomedullary nail dynamic/sliding hip screw ) . According feedback provide , important issue highlight quickly patient regain functional capacity ( mobility ) inference independence overall quality life , pre-injury level . The length hospital stay also important parameter judgement . Based patient feedback session , design study evaluate result treatment unstable pertrochanteric hip fracture focus soon mobility restore leading independence . Moreover , use length hospital stay secondary outcome would act surrogate mobility ( hospital discharge determine ability safely mobilize ) , would huge implication health care cost well , consider major contributor majority overall hospital cost . Finally , show 50 % hip fracture patient dementia , report independent risk factor poor outcome follow hip fracture . The investigator therefore argue even important cohort patient treat superior implant , thus include study . However , currently , limited experience regard clinical trial involve surgical patient dementia , particularly issue consent , recruitment retention/follow-up . This highlight recent review , find 8 10 hip fracture trial exclude ignored patient population cognitive impairment . However , one three patient hip fracture present simultaneously degree dementia , important population include . The investigator therefore propose concept feasibility study , investigate feasibility run study involve patient without dementia investigate outcome unstable pertrochanteric fracture ( AO/OTA type A2 ) , compare implantation Endovis BA 2 cephalomedullary nail ( device confer biomechanical advantage ) Dynamic/Sliding Hip Screw ( current `` gold standard '' ) . Patients fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion , invite participate study . Following patient patient 's carer/personal nominated consultee provide informed consent/assent participate study randomize use online randomisation tool , permute block , stratify cognitive status ( AMTS &lt; 8/≥8 ) . The abbreviated mental test score ( AMTS ) rapidly assess elderly patient possibility dementia assess confusion cognitive impairment . The doctor see patient conduct AMTS standard care . Although patient tell allocation consider blind may guess group allocate base incision size . The assessor clinical outcome , TUG assessment blind group allocation . Following surgery , patient followed-up week 2 , 4 12 post-operation ( per standard care practice ) . Information collect visit include , hip X-rays , functional score ( Lower Extremity Measure , London Handicap Scale , DEMQOL ) , TUG ( Timed Up Go ) test , complications/adverse event concomitant medication requirement . Within standard care patient undergo stage , extra measure research project Lower Extremity measure , London Handicap Scale TUG test . Lower Extremity Measure use patient AMTS score ≥8 whereas London Handicap Scale use patient AMTS score ≥8 . The TUG test involve stand seat position , walk three metre , turn around , walk three metre back chair return seat position . The TUG time note . The extra measure besides TUG test questionnaire give patient complete help Research Nurse . The DEMQOL involve carers complete Carer part DEMQOL questionnaire . For patient come nursing home 's nursing home staff complete DEMQOL carer questionnaire .</detailed_description>
