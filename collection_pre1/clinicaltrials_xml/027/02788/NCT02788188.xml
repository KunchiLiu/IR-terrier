	<brief_summary>Background : Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) newly discover contagious sometimes fatal respiratory virus . People often get MERS close contact infected person . Scientists worry MERS may spread cause infection . There vaccines treatment MERS right . Researchers think new therapy call SAB-301 may able help . Antibodies proteins body make attack virus . SAB-301 make antibody make cow fight MERS . The antibody collect plasma , liquid part cow blood . Objective : To evaluate safety tolerability SAB-301 healthy adult . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 60 : Do chronic medical problem Do take medication ( exception acetaminophen , ibuprofen , vitamin , seasonal allergy med oral contraception ) Do allergy beef product Agree use two form contraception study ( men woman ) Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical examination Blood urine test Participants return visit . They physical exam blood test . They randomly assign receive either SAB-301 placebo give infusion arm vein 1 3 hour . They monitor clinic 6 hour infusion . They additional blood draw . Participants 2-hour visit 1 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 42 , 90 day infusion . At visit evaluate blood urine test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The administration convalescent plasma hyperimmune immunoglobulin often use treatment emerge infectious disease . However , production large quantity anti-pathogen human plasma and/or immunoglobulin high affinity avidity antibody currently require donation convalescent human , process limit availability number reason . One novel alternative source transchromosomic ( Tc ) cattle produce fully human polyclonal IgG ( hIgG ) de novo mount robust antibody immune response vaccination . This study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity SAB-301 , fully human polyclonal anti-MERS IgG collect transchromosomic cattle . Beginning low single-dose , subject randomize receive either SAB-301 normal saline control , evaluate Study Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 21 , 42 , 90 . The safety tolerability evaluate use symptom , clinical laboratory test , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity assay . Utilizing series stopping rule medical monitor , dose escalate safety tolerability establish .</detailed_description>
