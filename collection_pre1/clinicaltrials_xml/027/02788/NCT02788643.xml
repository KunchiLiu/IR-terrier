	<brief_summary>Collagens proteins present tissue . Besides structural role , recent data show able regulate many cellular function . Many interaction occur extracellular matrix macromolecule , especially collagen , various cell type . These interaction control peptide derive extracellular matrix macromolecule , call matrikines . Previous work investigator laboratory others show several C-terminal domain ( NC1 domains ) basement membrane-associated collagen could regulate many cellular activity . Lung organ particularly abundant basement membrane . It likely various lung disease may affect metabolism basement membrane associate collagen . To investigator knowledge , study focused expression collagen XIX α1 chain collagen IV chain α3 α4 chain lung study possible variation expression various pathophysiological situation . The aim study : - Study presence collagen IV XIX ( fragment ) different type sample bronchoalveolar lavage , pulmonary aspiration bronchial biopsy - Evaluate quantitative variation expression collagen different pulmonary disease , especially chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathy , infectious pneumonia , pneumonitis lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Collagen IV XIX Bronchoalveolar Lavage , Pulmonary Aspiration Bronchial Biopsies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental Design : Cross-sectional study , prospective inclusion , single center . Investigations : - Realization bronchoscopy accord indication ( without bronchoalveolar lavage without bronchial biopsy , participation research modify patient 's care ) - sample send laboratory , centrifuge store -80°C assess . - sample use specific analysis study : - Study qualitative expression collagen IV XIX Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) Western Blot - Study quantitative variation collagen ELISA Statistical analysis planification : - description data ( mean standard deviation ) , - comparison different group ( non-pathological v pulmonary disease ) Student 's test , Wilcoxon , Chi2 Fisher test . Expected result prospect : The investigator able demonstrate presence collagen IV and/or collagen XIX different fragment biological sample . The investigator would able show variation expression collagen accord different pathological situation . In long term , objective validate collagen marker pulmonary pathology therapeutic agent .</detailed_description>
