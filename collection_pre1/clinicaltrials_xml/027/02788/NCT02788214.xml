	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylorus common bacterial infection . It lead severe stomach problem stomach cancer . Researchers want look sample bacteria . These take chronically infected people . They want identify genetic difference H. pylorus strain . This could help predict people get infect bacteria get cancer . This could lead cancer detect earlier . It could also mean less people get stomach cancer . Objectives : To study genetic variation H. pylorus strain base sample chronically infected people . To identify feature strain might lead severe stomach problem stomach cancer . Eligibility : People age 35 70 need upper endoscopy recently diagnose stomach cancer Design : Participants screen doctor procedure study nurse . Participants endoscopy 6 biopsy remove . These tissue sample . They size grain rice . Participants allow study team access report stomach exam . Participants stomach cancer donate tissue remove clinical care . They allow study team access report surgery . They also allow access microscope slide stomach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylorus , Gram-negative bacterium associate spectrum benign malignant gastric condition , one genetically variable pathogen . Variations gene associate risk inflammation carcinogenesis , date systematic study evaluate entire bacterial genome . We propose multicountry study establish analyze informative international collection H. pylori clinical isolates resident define geographic area . Molecular characterization conduct NCI/FNLCR . Our hypothesis genetic epigenetic variation H. pylori strain among chronically infect individual may affect risk progression gastric cancer . Findings study may help characterize differential virulence among H. pylorus isolate suggest predictive biomarkers early diagnosis cancer . The bacterial isolates database study also provide foundation elucidation H. pylorus pathogenesis .</detailed_description>
