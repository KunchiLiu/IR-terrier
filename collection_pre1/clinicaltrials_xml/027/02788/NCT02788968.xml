	<brief_summary>The study explore development ability age , call `` Development conflict detection reason - Decor '' take place CYCERON center include two group 22 participant : adolescent young adult ( N = 44 ) . More specifically , study aim compare change brain adolescent young adult conduct reason task may cognitive conflict . Both group participant spend MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) focus brain carry two classic task cover main area reason ( probabilistic economic ) . Each task manipulate include , , make information call intuition create conflict correct answer ( logic , normative ) bias response ( intuitive , heuristic ) . Because major implication brain region cognitive inhibition process [ intuitive answer ] , measure brain activity anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) task version `` '' `` '' conflict compare group . To good understand link development CCA adolescence adulthood conflict detection , activity measurement correlate part morphometric measurement take area ( volume Substance Grise - SG ; characteristic cortical sulcus ) secondly cognitive measure ( executive function - inhibitory control ) . This cross-sectional study focus two age group : 11-15 year 19-25 year . For age group , participation men / boy woman / girl balance .</brief_summary>
