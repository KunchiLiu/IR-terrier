	<brief_title>Cardiopulmonary Response Conical-PEP Breathing During Exercise Older People .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It known structure physiological function deteriorate age , lead decrease exercise performance , functional decline gradual decrease physical activity age . The essential change respiratory physiology : dilatation alveolus , enlargement air space , decrease gas exchange surface area , loss support tissue distal airway ( senile emphysema ) , decree chest wall compliance decrease respiratory muscle strength . These change lead decrease lung elastic recoil , increase residual volume functional capacity , increase work breathe rest . In addition , change affect respiratory function , especially dynamic hyperinflation ( DH ) development could one factor relate dyspnea exercise age Positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) therapy DH treatment exercise report several study . It possible PEP breathing may improve cardiopulmonary response exercise old people .</detailed_description>
