	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer lead cause cancer death among men Western world . Early detection prostate cancer show decrease mortality , limitation low specificity lead unnecessary biopsy over-diagnosis low-risk cancer . The STHLM3 trial pave way improved specificity early detection prostate cancer use blood-based STHLM3 test identify men increase risk harbour significant prostate cancer . Targeted prostate biopsy base MRI image show increase sensitivity high-grade cancer compare currently use systematic biopsy , exist evidence contradictory free methodological flaw . The primary aim STHLM3-MR/Fusion increase specificity early detection prostate cancer without decrease sensitivity aggressive prostate cancer introduce targeted prostate biopsy compare traditional prostate biopsy . The primary endpoint number perform biopsy number detect high-grade prostate cancer define Gleason 7 high . Secondary endpoint include number low risk prostate cancer diagnose proportion patient up-or downgraded disease assessment prostatectomy specimen . Additional aim include assess health economic consequence implement MRI base prostate cancer diagnostics improve quality effectiveness prostate cancer diagnosis routine health care Stockholm . The STHLM3-MR/Fusion project perform two separate phase , analyze separately . Based power calculation , approximately 500 planned prostate biopsy include first phase . Men previously diagnose prostate cancer may take part study . The study period Phase 1 March 2016 January 2017 . The second phase start autumn 2016 end December 2017 .</brief_summary>
