	<detailed_description>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome ( WKS ) , think rare condition , known common people nutritional deficiency alcohol dependence . The primary cause WKS thiamine deficiency , 90 % case report alcohol dependent patient alcohol dependence predisposes severe nutritional deficiency . WKS may lead significant , long-term brain dysfunction severe effect work , personal social function . Whilst effective treatment may greatly reduce severe disability human social cost illness , almost evidence exists optimal dose regimen . This project propose develop quality evidence effective treatment WKS Aboriginal setting.. The need evidence-based thiamine treatment protocols great clinical importance two related reason . First , relation acute symptomatic WKS , failure treat immediately adequately may result profound often permanent cognitive neurological disability . Secondly , need evidence-based treatment guideline greatly magnify recognised milder , subclinical WKS may preventable adequate thiamine treatment . The aim study determine optimal thiamine dose require : A . Treatment acute symptomatic WKS among Aboriginal non-Aboriginal alcohol dependent patient . B . Reducing prevent subclinical WKS-related brain damage at-risk Aboriginal non-Aboriginal alcohol-dependent patient . Primary Hypotheses 1 . Among alcohol-dependent patient acute symptomatic WKS , high dose parenteral thiamine ( 1500mg ) lead great improvement specific cognition neurological function low dos ( 900mg 300mg ) . 2 . Among alcohol-dependent patient high risk subclinical WKS-related brain damage , high dose parenteral thiamine ( 900mg ) lead great improvement specific cognition neurological function compare low dos ( 300mg 100mg ) . Secondary Hypotheses 1 . Thiamine deficient patient show poor performance cognitive neurological measure . 2 . Patients concurrent magnesium deficiency show great impairment baseline . 3 . Nutritional risk alcohol frequency correlate thiamine pyrophosphate level . 4 . Number previous admission thiamine supplementation past 3 month correlate thiamine pyrophosphate level</detailed_description>
