	<brief_summary>Background : In people infected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , immune system control HIV infection . They need drug call combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) control HIV . When people stop cART treatment , immune system control infection . They also become resistant cART last side effect . Researchers want test drug vedolizumab effective control HIV infection without need cART . Objective : To teste vedolizumab safe control amount HIV blood cART take . Eligibility : People age 18-65 HIV treat cART Design : Participants screen : Physical exam Medical history Electrocardiogram : Soft , sticky patch chest , arm , legs measure heart activity . Blood urine test Participants baseline visit . This 2-5 hour day 1-2 day . It include repeats screening test : Leukapheresis : Blood remove needle arm . A machine separate white blood cell blood . The rest blood return participant . Neurologic exam : The nerve reflexes test . First vedolizumab infusion arm vein Participants visit every 4 week 30 week . These include : Vedolizumab infusion Repeats baseline test Participants visit blood draw . Participants keep take cART week 22 infusion . After discontinue cART study week 22 , participant see every two week monitor CD4 count level HIV blood . Some visit occur infusion visit take 1 hour complete . cART restart participant HIV level go high , CD4 cell count decrease much . For follow-up phase , participant visit every 4 week 24 week . These include blood test physical exam .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vedolizumab ( Anti-alpha4beta7 ) Subjects With HIV Infection Undergoing Analytical Treatment Interruption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) improve clinical outcome HIV-infected individual , persistence viral reservoir peripheral blood lymphoid tissue remain hurdle complete eradication virus cure infection . The concept HIV preferentially infect discrete subset CD4+ T cell underscore need develop therapeutic exploit specific cell-virus interaction . T cell express integrin alpha4beta7 regulate migration gutassociated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) , also concomitantly bind HIV , place prime position disseminate HIV throughout tissue . Previously , show HIV envelope protein gp120 bind alpha4beta7 CD4+ T cell vitro , alpha4beta7high CD4+ T cell highly susceptible productive HIV infection vitro , administration anti-alpha4beta7 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) prevent and/or delay transmission SIV upon repeat challenge preserve CD4+ T cell rhesus macaque . Furthermore , demonstrated administration anti-alpha4beta7 mAb SIV-infected rhesus macaque receive cART suppresses plasma viremia extend period follow discontinuation cART , collectively suggest sustain virologic remission absence cART may achieve via direct target alpha4beta7 integrin . It well establish vast majority HIV-infected individual treat cART experience plasma viral rebound within week cessation therapy . Considering current research treatment HIV-infected individual heavily focus develop strategy aim achieve sustain virologic remission absence cART , great interest investigate whether administration anti-alpha4beta7 mAb prevent plasma viral rebound allow durable suppression viral replication HIV infect individual discontinuation cART . We propose examine effect vedolizumab , FDA approve anti-alpha4beta7 mAb treatment ulcerative colitis Crohn disease , plasma viral rebound HIV-infected individual follow analytical treatment interruption ( ATI ) .</detailed_description>

Willingness sample store future research Participation Women : Contraception : The effect vedolizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Chronic hepatitis B , evidence positive test hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , evidence positive test HCV RNA . Subjects positive test HCV antibody negative test HCV RNA eligible . 2 . Documented nadir CD4+ T cell count &lt; 200 cell /mm3 3 . Documented multiclass antiretroviral drug resistance , judgment investigator , would pose risk virologic failure additional mutation develop study 4 . HIV immunotherapy vaccine ( ) receive within 1 year prior screen 5 . Any licensed experimental nonHIV vaccination ( e.g. , hepatitis B , influenza , pneumococcal polysaccharide ) receive within 2 week prior study enrollment 6 . Receipt investigational study agent within 28 day enrollment 7 . Any active malignancy may require systemic chemotherapy radiation therapy 8 . Systemic immunosuppressive medication receive within 3 month prior enrollment . The follow exclude : [ 1 ] corticosteroid nasal spray inhaler ; [ 2 ] topical corticosteroid mild , uncomplicated dermatitis ; [ 3 ] oral/parenteral corticosteroid administer nonchronic condition expect recur ( length therapy less equal 10 day , completion equal 30 day prior enrollment ) 9 . History clinical evidence : Significant unstable cardiac disease ( e.g. , angina , congestive heart failure , recent myocardial infarction ) Severe illness , chronic liver disease , malignancy , immunodeficiency HIV , active systemic infection HIV , condition , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study Active latent tuberculosis , regardless treatment history 10 .
