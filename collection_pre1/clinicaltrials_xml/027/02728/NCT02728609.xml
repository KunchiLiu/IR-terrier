	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine , protein content , white blood cell ( WBC ) count present peritoneal fluid plasma trauma patient undergo one two different method open abdominal closure . Following analysis peritoneal fluid serum sample , comparison result two group complete correlated overall organ function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Analysis Cytokine Concentration Open Abdominal Closure Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated pro anti-inflammatory cytokine implicate marker multi-system organ failure ( MOF ) death trauma patient . Abdominal surgery raise level cytokine may lead elevate plasma level inflammatory cytokine possibly lead worsen patient prognosis . Patients open abdominal closure require often sick trauma patient . Two different temporary abdominal closure technique generally use Presley Memorial Trauma Center , one use blue towel : vacuum pack technique one use commercially available ABThera vacuum device Kinetic Concepts , Inc ( KCI ) . This study conduct determine ABThera temporary closure technique remove great amount cytokine abdominal cavity possibly lessen amount systemic plasma cytokine thus decrease incidence MOF death ill population patient . Additionally , study conduct determine white blood cell count may lower patient least cytokine value also investigate protein loss patient . The depletion body store protein due open abdomen great nutritional , therefore , heal implication . Enrollment include 40 subject meet eligibility criterion study . The study population include 20 patient temporarily close use ABThera device 20 temporarily close use blue towel : vacuum pack technique . Peritoneal fluid blood collect eligible subject immediately upon arrival ICU follow surgery 12 , 24 , 48 72 hour follow placement . Peritoneal fluid collect drainage system Lukens trap . Blood collect exist intravenous arterial line . The peritoneal fluid centrifuge , separate , frozen -80 degree centigrade analysis cytokine/inflammatory marker , protein , WBC count . The blood specimen centrifuge , separate , frozen cytokine/inflammatory marker analysis . Chemistry hematology value complete standard care collect hospital chart along general demographic , description injury , treatment modality , outcome . The first sample blood peritoneal fluid obtain immediately arrival ICU lab drawn standard care . These sample put aside consent obtain legally authorize representative subject . If research subject and/or legally authorize representative decide subject participate study , sample destroy additional study procedure obtain . If legally authorize representative available within 12 hour initial specimen subject unable consider participation within 12 hour initial specimen , subject enrol study , sample obtain immediately arrival ICU destroyed . After analysis complete , comparison cytokine level , WBC count , protein extraction two vacuum method complete correlated patient ' overall organ function .</detailed_description>
