	<brief_summary>This study randomize , control , double-blinded , single-centre superiority trial two parallel group . The primary outcome average myofascial pelvic pain two week follow final injection treatment assess use visual analogue scale . Randomization perform block randomization 1:1 allocation ratio , stratify base opioid use time study enrollment . In total , 60 participant recruit randomize , 30 assign treatment arm . The study restrict half participant enrol current concomitant opioid user ( reason ) half use opioid drug within 3 month precede enrollment study . A third non-randomized arm 30 participant wait list chronic pain clinic enrol compare two randomized arm . Among patient population set Chronic Pain Clinic determine would acceptable randomize participant no-treatment control group . As , active treatment use comparator randomized trial . In order ass participant absence treatment third non-randomized arm serve no-treatment control group . Eligibility criterion third arm main study , exception stratification restriction opioid use status . Participation third arm exclude participant randomization one two main arm study .

	<detailed_description>Study Setting : This study conduct Chronic Pain Clinic Hotel Dieu Hospital General Gynecology Clinic Kingston General Hospital Kingston , Ontario , Canada . All physician provide trigger point injection treatment chronic pelvic pain Chronic Pain Clinic agree participate co-investigators study ( RN , RH , SC ) . Women refer clinic treatment chronic pelvic pain primary care provider gynecologists Kingston surround area . Two investigator ( RN SC ) see patient General Gynecology Clinic assessment management chronic pelvic pain . Both investigator regularly refer patient Chronic Pain Clinic consideration trigger point injection . Participant Timeline : Participants study follow total 8 treatment 9 study visit period 12 week . Participants third wait-listed arm study follow 3 visit period 12 week . Treatment Arms , Baseline Visit &amp; Treatment 1 : At baseline study visit research nurse administer questionnaire order obtain thorough medical history collect information participant demographic . The research nurse administer VAS pain scale pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire base participant 's experience week precede baseline visit WHOQOL-BREF base participant 's experience 4 week precede baseline visit . A study investigator mix administer trigger point injection . The research nurse remain present treatment assist record administer VAS pain scale procedural discomfort immediately follow completion treatment . Treatment Arms , Follow Up Visits &amp; Treatments 2-8 : In total , participant see 7 follow visit additional treatment . Visits 2 4 do weekly basis visit 5 8 do bi-weekly , total time 11 week . At visit research nurse administer VAS pain scale pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire base participant 's experience week precede visit . The research nurse ask question concomitant medication usage screen participant adverse event injection-associated complication . In addition visit 5 research nurse administer WHOQOL-BREF . A study investigator mix administer trigger point injection . The research nurse remain present treatment assist record administer VAS pain scale procedural discomfort immediately follow completion treatment . Treatment Arms , Final Study Visit 9 : For participant undergo full course treatment final study visit visit 9 occur 12 week baseline visit . If woman choose conclude treatment early , reason , final visit occur earlier 12 week . However , final visit must always do least 1 week final trigger point injection treatment . At final study visit research nurse administer VAS pain scale pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire base participant 's experience week precede visit WHOQOL-BREF base participant 's experience 4 week precede visit . The research nurse ask question concomitant medication usage screen participant adverse event injection-associated complication . In order ass blind participant ask treatment believe received reason belief . Participants also ask would recommend treatment others experience myofascial pelvic pain . Finally , participant offer continuation treatment care primary investigator injection formulation choose still experience myofascial pelvic pain . Wait-List Arm , Baseline , Follow Up Final Study Visit : At baseline study visit research nurse administer questionnaire order obtain thorough medical history collect information participant demographic . The research nurse administer VAS pain scale pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire base participant 's experience week precede baseline visit WHOQOL-BREF base participant 's experience 4 week precede baseline visit . The research nurse ask question concomitant medication usage . A follow visit complete 5 week baseline visit . At visit research nurse administer VAS pain scale pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire base participant 's experience week precede visit WHOQOL-BREF base participant 's experience 4 week precede visit . The research nurse ask question concomitant medication usage . For participant wait-list least 12 week final study visit occur 12 week baseline visit . If woman wait-list 12 week final study visit occur first visit Chronic Pain Clinic . At final study visit research nurse administer VAS pain scale pelvic pain specific functional questionnaire base participant 's experience week precede visit WHOQOL-BREF base participant 's experience 4 week precede visit .
