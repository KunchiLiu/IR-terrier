	<detailed_description>Milrinone phosphodiesterase type III ( PDE3 ) inhibitor sit action cardiac vascular smooth muscle . PDE3 hydrolyze critical second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) , PDE3 inhibition ( PDE3i ) result positive inotropic effect heart increase cAMP . PDE3i cause relaxation vascular smooth muscle induces vasodilation concomitantly reduce myocardial oxygen consumption . In adult , long term PDE3i result malignant arrhythmia increase risk sudden death , therefore recommend therapy population . However , pediatric Heart Failure ( HF ) population , long-term outpatient milrinone infusion safely use palliative therapy bridge transplant without increase risk unexpected death , result fewer HF emergency department visit admission improve New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) /Ross classification . In addition , short term PDE3i ( i.e . milrinone ) successfully routinely used child present decompensated HF follow cardiac surgery . In child undergo cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass predictable fall cardiac index 6 18 hour cardiac surgery . This phenomenon know low cardiac output syndrome ( LCOS ) typify tachycardia poor perfusion result end-organ dysfunction risk cardiac arrest . Milrinone proven drug prophylactic use child follow cardiac surgery prevention LCOS . While standard dose milrinone routinely use child , actual dose-response relationship unknown . Indeed , investigator note significant variability serum milrinone concentration patient despite weight base dose strategy . This uncertainty dose confound difference patient age , size ontologic maturation kidney . Milrinone dose adjustment , therefore , vary widely among practitioner base urine output , degree systemic vasodilation change serum creatinine . Additional uncertainty resides inability easily identify appropriate milrinone dose produce biological effect ( increase critical secondary messenger , ( cAMP ) pediatric population . Because milrinone excrete unchanged drug urine , kidney function critical factor milrinone dosing . Recently publish data demonstrate 73 % milrinone level child acute kidney injury ( AKI ) outside therapeutic range . Thus , child particularly vulnerable inappropriate milrinone dose . Currently , AKI diagnose increase serum creatinine ( SCr ) . Unfortunately , increase SCr may occur 3 day AKI occur . Thus , child treat milrinone , undetected AKI would result significant over-dosing . Since milrinone also potent vasodilator , excess milrinone dose AKI could lead hypotension - exacerbation AKI . Therefore , early detection AKI especially important child receive milrinone . Preliminary data demonstrate supra therapeutic milrinone concentration urinary AKI biomarkers increase advance SCr patient AKI . In grant , investigator propose determine increase Tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase insulin like growth factor bind protein-7 ( TIMP2xIGFBP7 ) ( prior increase SCr ) correlate increase platelet cAMP supra-therapeutic milrinone level . In absence ability identify optimal dose , child risk clinically relevant under-dosing milrinone lead hemodynamic compromise end organ dysfunction . While clinical response milrinone remain important factor dose titration decision , order fully optimize milrinone dose minimize drug-related toxicity , biomarker representative biologic milrinone effect need . The Investigators recently demonstrate milrinone treatment result increase myocardial cAMP level augment phospholamban phosphorylation child , adult , idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy . In addition , preliminary data suggest platelet cAMP level correlate tissue level . The purpose study determine platelet cAMP level serve circulate biomarker end organ ( cardiac ) milrinone efficacy , investigate whether change biomarker correlate clinical efficacy . Defining platelet cAMP level pediatric patient heart disease would provide basis personalize approach milrinone dose titration allow identification likely benefit use .</detailed_description>
