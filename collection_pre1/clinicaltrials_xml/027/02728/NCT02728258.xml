	<brief_title>Copanlisib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity copanlisib ( BAY 80-6946 ) patient persistent recurrent endometrial carcinoma harbor phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PI3KCA ) hotspot mutation frequency objective response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 6 month progression-free survival ( PFS ) median PFS . II . To estimate distribution duration overall survival ( OS ) . III . To assess safety profile copanlisib endometrial cancer patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To systematically evaluate sequence site ( i.e. , exome ) characteristic PIK3CA mutation endometrial cancer patient correlate mutation overall response ( OR ) , PFS , OS patient treat copanlisib . OUTLINE : Patients receive copanlisib intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
