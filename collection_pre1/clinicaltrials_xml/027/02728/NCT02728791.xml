	<brief_title>Comparison Allows Measurement Cardiac Output Between Clearsight System Transpulmonary Thermodilution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 2014 , Edwards society develop completely non-invasive monitoring device measurement blood pressure continuous cardiac output without insert foreign intravascular body patient . Initially test healthy volunteer cardiac disease -free , correlation device seem good . If ClearSight © system show relevant accuracy measure blood pressure cardiac output specific ICU hospitalized population , could justify place therapeutic arsenal monitoring intensive care . This common care , prospective observational single center study , concern result blood pressure , cardiac output value variation .</detailed_description>
