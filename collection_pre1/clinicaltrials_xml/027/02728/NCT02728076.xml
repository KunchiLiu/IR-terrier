	<brief_summary>This study examine feasibility deliver accelerate partial breast irradiaiton ( APBI ) lumpectomy perform . By administer APBI lumpectomy , small volume breast tissue may expose radiation . The APBI method use study 3D ( three dimensional ) conformal external beam irradiation . 3D-conformal external beam irradiation use X-ray beam deliver radiation dose . Traditionally , CT image used plan treatment . In study , MRI use . Approximately five eight week completion APBI , cancer surgically remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine feasibility , complication rate , cosmetic result local control rate 3D-CRT confine region lumpectomy cavity patient Stage I IIa ( less equal 3 cm ) carcinoma breast ( non-lobular histology ) treat APBI use 3D-CRT lumpectomy . This study also test feasibility MRI-based treatment plan preoperative accelerate partial breast irradiation compare dosimetric data treatment planning patient treat previous institutional post-op APBI protocol . It also look overall survival rate . Correlative study include measure change tumor gene expression immune response radiation therapy correlate pathologic response .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pathologically proven diagnosis invasive breast cancer , clinically stage III . Female Age ≥50 year Estrogen receptor positive Patients her2 positive her2 negative tumor eligible Unifocal disease Invasive ductal carcinoma diagnose core needle biopsy Clinically node negative physical exam ultrasound . All enlarge abnormal appear lymph node must biopsied . Zubrod performance status 02 Study entry must within 120 day initial diagnosis breast cancer . CBC/differential obtain within 14 day prior study entry , adequate bone marrow function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3 ; Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3 ; Hemoglobin ≥8.0g/dl . Not pregnant lactating ; willing use acceptable form contraception radiation therapy . Prior breast augmentation , include breast implant , allow . Patients prior history contralateral breast cancer consider eligible complete treatment ( include antiendocrine therapy ) five year prior registration . Patients must prior treatment malignancy diagnose treat within past five year , exception nonmelanomatous skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix contralateral breast cancer . Interested patient must meet medical oncologist prior study entry determine Oncotype testing recommend . If recommend patient amenable possibility receive chemotherapy , must adequate biopsy tissue test . If adequate tissue available Oncotype testing , patient interested participation may undergo additional biopsy . If patient plan refuse chemotherapy regardless high Oncotype result elect forgo test , still eligible enrollment . Patients must estrogen progesterone receptor analysis perform biopsy specimen prior study entry accord current ASCO/CAP Guideline Recommendations hormone receptor test . Testing her2 neu expression must also perform record prior study entry . Appropriate stage pretreatment evaluation protocol entry , include clinical evidence distant metastasis , base upon follow minimum diagnostic workup : History/Physical examination , include breast exam ( inspection palpation breast ) documentation weight Zubrod Performance Status 02 within 28 day prior study entry . Right leave mammography within 60 day diagnostic biopsy establish diagnosis . Evaluation axilla ultrasound biopsy enlarge abnormal appear lymph node within 28 day prior study entry . Clip place within biopsy prove breast cancer , verification placement mammogram . AJCC clinical T3 , N13 , M1 , stage IIB , stage III stage IV breast cancer Prior invasive nonbreast malignancy ( exception include nonmelanomatous skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , prior contralateral breast cancer describe 3.1.11 ) unless disease free treatment minimum five year prior study entry . Multifocal breast cancer Modified BloomRichardson Grade 3 disease Estrogen receptor negative disease Lymphovascular space invasion note biopsy Invasive lobular carcinoma Purely noninvasive breast cancer ( i.e . ductal carcinoma situ , lobular carcinoma situ ) Nonepithelial breast malignancy sarcoma lymphoma Paget 's disease nipple Male breast cancer Prior history radiation therapy chest region ipsilateral breast would result overlap radiation field . Patients receive planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy concurrent chemotherapy . A recommendation adjuvant chemotherapy preclude eligibility . However , patient Oncotype score would lead recommendation systemic chemotherapy ( see section 3.1.13 ) , chemotherapy plan give neoadjuvant setting , patient would ineligible enrollment . Patients unable undergo MRI . This could include patient severe allergy gadolinium contrast patient renal function insufficient receive contrast ( GFR less 30 ) . Patients minor allergy ( example , skin rash hive ) gadolinium contrast may still consider enrollment . These patient would receive prophylactic prednisone diphenhydramine per MCW department radiology protocol . Such case review principal investigator radiology cochair prior enrollment . History connective tissue disorder , include lupus , dermatomyositis scleroderma . Zubrod performance status 3 great Known BRCA mutation Medical , psychiatric condition would prevent patient receive protocol therapy provide informed consent . Patients , best estimate treat radiation oncologist , life expectancy 10 year less . Patients pregnant . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month ; Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month ; Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration ; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy within 30 day registration ; Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol</criteria>
