	<detailed_description>It estimate half patient diagnose knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) need total knee replacement ( TKR ) lifetime . Of patient need TKR , 80-95 % overweight obese . While patient encourage lose weight , limited , , guidance provide achieve recommended weight loss . Many patient perceive TKR necessary precursor initiation weight loss . Yet , 66 % patient actually gain weight 2 year surgery . Patients undergo TKR face unique barrier ( i.e. , pain , mobility limitation , motivation ) weight loss , also balance pre- post-operative concern physician , surgeon , rehabilitation specialist . To best accommodate need patient ( pre- post-TKR ) healthcare professional ( i.e. , surgeon , physical therapist ) , patient stakeholder engagement activation imperative development patient-centered weight loss intervention . Investigators complete 20 interview patient pre- post-TKR identified weight loss barrier , prefer intervention component ( e.g. , delivery method , contact frequency , self-monitoring modality ) patient-reported outcome ( e.g. , physical function , pain ) view critical patient . Investigators develop patient-centered weight loss program ( PACE ) guide result additional input stakeholder meet needs patient healthcare professional . PACE randomize pilot study compare weight loss patient-reported outcome PACE ( program start 6 week pre-TKR 12 week post-TKR ) Delayed PACE ( program start 12 week post-TKR 26 week post-TKR ) .</detailed_description>
