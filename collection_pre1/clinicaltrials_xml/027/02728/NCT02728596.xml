	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study prophylactic colony stimulate factor management patient breast , colorectal non-small cell lung cancer receive chemotherapy risk develop febrile neutropenia . Patients receive chemotherapy may develop febrile neutropenia . Febrile neutropenia condition involve fever low number neutrophil ( type white blood cell ) blood . Febrile neutropenia increase risk infection . Colony stimulate factor medication sometimes give patient receive chemotherapy prevent febrile neutropenia . Colony stimulate factor give patient base guideline . Some clinic automate system help doctor decide prescribe high risk develop febrile neutropenia . Gathering information use automate system prescribe prophylactic colony stimulate factor may help doctor use colony stimulate factor need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare use primary prophylactic colony stimulate factor ( PP-CSF ) accord recommend clinical practice guideline among patient register intervention component versus usual care component . II . To compare rate febrile neutropenia ( FN ) among patient register intervention component versus usual care component . III . To compare rate FN among intermediate risk patient register intervention component component treatment assignment ( administer PP-CSF intermediate risk patient versus ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare rate FN among low-risk patient register intervention component versus usual care component . II . To compare FN-related health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) among low-risk patient register intervention component versus usual care component . III . To compare patient adherence PP-CSF prescribing among patient register intervention component versus usual care component . IV . To compare patient knowledge indication , efficacy , side effect associate PP-CSF initiation conclusion first cycle myelosuppressive systemic therapy among patient register intervention component versus usual care component . V. To compare proportion patient complete initial systemic therapy regimen plan duration plan dose intensity among patient register intervention component versus usual care component . VI . To compare antibiotic use prophylaxis treatment FN among patient register intervention component versus usual care component . VII . To compare rate FN-related emergency department visit hospitalization among intermediate risk patient register Intervention component component treatment assignment ( administer PP-CSF intermediate risk patient versus ) . VIII . To compare FN-related health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) among intermediate risk patient register intervention component component treatment assignment ( administer PP-CSF intermediate risk patient versus ) . IX . To compare overall survival among intermediate risk patient register intervention component component treatment assignment ( administer PP-CSF intermediate risk patient versus ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize descriptively report difference among cohort component intervention usual care component . II . To evaluate time invasive recurrence non-metastatic patient component treatment assignment OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 clinic group . CLINIC GROUP 1 ( CLINIC WITH AUTOMATED SYSTEM ) : Patients high risk develop FN receive CSF base automated system recommendation . The automated system suggest CSFs use drug low risk FN . CLINIC GROUP 2 ( CLINIC WITH NO AUTOMATED SYSTEM ) : Patients receive CSF base clinical practice guideline . CLINIC GROUP 3 ( CLINIC WITH AUTOMATED SYSTEM ) : Patients high moderate risk develop FN receive CSF base automated system recommendation . The automated system suggest CSFs use drug low risk FN . CLINIC GROUP 4 ( CLINIC WITH AUTOMATED SYSTEM ) : Patients high risk develop FN receive CSF base automated system recommendation . The automated system suggest CSF use drug moderate risk FN . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
