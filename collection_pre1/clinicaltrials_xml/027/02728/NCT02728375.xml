	<detailed_description>This research project focus evaluation innovative , engage computer game-based exercise system use rehabilitation young child cerebral palsy , transition use home . The goal research program produce high quality therapeutic point-of-care approach cost-effective delivery system lead well long-term health outcome . At present , challenge entail provide therapy service continue put identified child risk miss opportunity maximize neuro-developmental capacity , sustain behavioral recovery prevent future complication . Canada India face grow population child neuro-developmental disability distribute across broad geographic region . Cerebral palsy common neuro-developmental disability childhood . The prevalence cerebral palsy ( CP ) develop country estimate 5 10 time great North America . Children CP result deficit fine gross motor skill often co-occurring deficit attention cognitive function . Half child CP impair upper extremity function ( reach , grasp manipulate object ) . The ability perform functional task upper extremity important predictor success daily activity participation school , leisure aspect community life . There many thing consider develop therapy program design improve motor psychomotor skill affect child maximize neuro-developmental capacity prevent development secondary disability . Intense repetitive task practice , constraint-induced movement therapy one effective neuro-rehabilitative strategy show improve upper extremity motor function child CP , potential overcome developmental difficulty . Constraint induce movement therapy consist constrain use unaffected upper limb encourage use affect upper limb . However often difficult engage child therapy sustain motivation engage intense repetitive task practice use affected upper limb . Thus , need effective approach tool motivate young child CP complete long-term neuro-rehabilitation program provide developmental opportunity . Digital medium game receive considerable interest researcher clinicians model learn broad range complex task facilitate transfer skill daily life . These emerge rehabilitation technology potential improve clinical outcome child participation engaging , motivate accessible . For purpose investigator develop computer game-based rehabilitation learn platform ( CRP ) . This approach combine fine gross motor exercise cognitive activity appropriate child neuro- developmental disorder . The approach design provide engage , high-quality , personalize therapy clinical rehabilitation setting , could also implemented school home via Tele rehabilitation . Research Goal : This research project focus evaluation engage exercise cognitive computer game-based platform embed assessment tool use clinical practice transition use home , elementary classroom . The goal research program produce innovative therapeutic point-of-care cost-effective delivery system lead good long-term health outcome toddler child neurodevelopmental disability . The program ground investigator technological development current research document benefit computer-aided learning tool , exercise gaming application rehabilitation principle adaptive learn neuroplasticity . Investigators conduct randomize controlled trial study feasibility effectiveness computer-aided , game-based repetitive task practice ( RTP ) program design train fine gross motor skill hand-arms psychomotor skill ( ) young child CP . RESEARCH PROJECT OBJECTIVE 1 The CRP include design rehabilitation assessment game capable monitoring every child 's performance therapy . It quantify motor skill parameter , well , visual-spatial skill executive cognitive function . It produce electronic record outcome measure thus allow u track change time . It also provide timely feedback child therapist . Objective : To evaluate test-retest reliability convergent validity assessment tool embed game-based rehabilitation platform . Specifically fine gross motor skill psychomotor skills child age 4-11 year ( n= 40 ) diagnose cerebral palsy acquire brain injury . The new tool compare commonly use outcome measure i.e . Quality Upper Extremity skills test ( QUEST ) Peabody Developmental Motor Scale version 2 ( PDMS-2 ) . This provide reliable test protocol valid measure accurately quickly quantify hand-arm function independent object-task type , use daily clinical practice research . Two common test fine gross motor skill CP child ; ) Quality Upper Extremity Skills Test ( QUEST ) b ) Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-2 . We hypothesize performance measure game-based assessment tool would : 1 . Exhibit high test retest reliability ( Intra class correlation &gt; 0.7 ) , Standard error measure less 20 % group mean 2 . Show moderate convergent validity ( correlation , r &gt; 0.06 ) primary outcome measure . RESEARCH PROJECT OBJECTIVE 2 An exploratory randomize clinical trial conduct evaluate feasibility benefit game-based rehabilitation program fine manual dexterity skill gross motor skill child age 4-11 year ( n= 60 ) diagnose cerebral palsy . Two group child examine , one group receive experimental game-based program group receive usual therapy . Each program would take 16 week , three therapy session per week . Using process randomization , participant assign either experimental control group initial assessment screening perform blind assessor . Before treatment session begin , end 16 week follow session 16 week , clinician conduct regular assessment session participant mark progress till date . Investigators examine feasibility assessment tool embed game-based rehabilitation platform also usability safety appeal protocol . Investigators observe estimation effectiveness sample use mixed method Analysis Variance within ( repeated measure ) group effect . STUDY DESIGN : Exploratory Randomized Clinical Trial METHOD OF COLLECTION OF DATA : Ethical clearance study obtain Institutional Ethical Committee S. D. M. College Medical Sciences Hospital , Dharwad obtain Institutional Ethical committee Christian Medical College , Ludhiana , India . Participants recruit clinician work Outpatient Department , S.D.M . Hospital , Dharwad , India Christian Medical College Hospital , Ludhiana , India . Participants consent take part study ask use object instrument miniature motion mouse play various therapeutic yet entertain game handle move test therapeutic object part experimental therapy protocol . The object use everyday item ; ) lifting/rotating sport ball small beach ball require bimanual handling , b ) roll cylinder object ( diameter 6-10 cm finger extend use elbow shoulder motion , c ) grasp grasp small glass sponge ball whole hand rotate ( supination- pronation motion ) ) motion small wand ( pencil ) 3-finger pinch grip use hand-wrist motion , e ) turn key 2-finger pinch fine finger control . These object represent wide range physical property require different mode manipulation functional demand sufficient test assessment tool . In control group : 1 ) Stretching Biceps , Lattisimus dorsi , Pronators , Thumb muscle . 2 ) Weight Bearing Exercises . 3 ) CIMT 20 min per day 3-4 week , repeat task 15-20 time . Pegboard activity , Rings : reaching- remove put back , Ball throw ( arm ) - basket keep 10 15 meter distance , open bottle cap ( large size bottle ) , Opening close door handle activity , Holding water bottle , bag hand transfer 10 20 meter distance , Crumbling paper , Clay activity , Picking marble sand 4 ) Hand arm bimanual activity : Throwing ball hand , Holding ball hand transfer , Holding bolster keep place , Holding notebook hand , Holding rack hand , Holding plate one hand spoon hand , Pushing door wall hand . Further parent query regard study report principal investigator . The parent would reassure information would keep confidential use study purpose .</detailed_description>
