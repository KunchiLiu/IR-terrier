	<brief_summary>Post exercise irisin level PWS patient Obesity , short stature , hypogonadism , hypotonia impair cognition major clinical feature Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) , complex neurogenetic disorder due lack expression paternal gene chromosomal region 15q11-13 . Abnormal body composition decrease muscle mass increase fat mass contributes low rest energy expenditure PWS . Severe caloric restriction range 800 kcal per day along daily exercise regimen need prevent weight gain complication obesity population . Brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) think present infant , know present adult well , differs abundant white adipose tissue ( WAT ) dissipate energy thermogenesis result increase activity mitochondrial uncouple protein ( UCP-1 ) . Recently evidence show exercise activate mitochondrial UCP-1 subcutaneous WAT cell result conversion WAT BAT-like adipocytes ( Beige BRITE adipose tissue ) . Various factor include natriuretic peptide , interleukin-6 myokines ( irisin , fibroblast growth factor 21 , ÃŸ-aminoisobutyric acid ) appear mediate effect exercise muscle subcutaneous adipocytes . Decreased amount and/or activity BAT might contribute low energy expenditure extreme difficulty weight-control PWS . Lower level decrease myokine production could result failure convert subcutaneous WAT Beige BAT-like adipocytes , therefore minimize negate otherwise beneficial metabolic effect exercise . Direct measurement peak oxygen uptake PWS adult show population markedly low VO2 value compare normal BMI-matched control . BAT activity vivo accurately measure perform PET/CT scan include administrate radioactive tracer . For ethical reason , direct assessment BAT possible purpose clinical research PWS individual . The investigator propose study humoral response exercise 16 ( 8 male ) PWS adolescent young adult compare result responses similar number sex , age , BMI-matched control . At initial one-hour meeting study participant learn perform aerobic ( treadmill ) exercise resistance training supervision experience exercise physiologist . Exercise intensity assess direct measurement VO2 max . On different day , blood sample draw immediately conclusion exercise regimen . Blood sample assay irisin , interleukin-6 , atrial natriuretic peptide , FGF-21 , addition glucose , growth hormone , cortisol , norepinephrine , lactate . The investigator hypothesize PWS participant show weak humoral response similar exercise regimen compare normal control subject . Data show low level myokines , irisin , follow exercise PWS might suggest inadequate conversion WAT BAT-like adipocytes subcutaneous adipose tissue result decrease thermogenesis abnormally low energy expenditure population . Potentially , development pharmacologic agent mimic irisin myokines activate UCP-1 convert WAT BAT-like adipocytes could offer new approach weight-control PWS individual .</brief_summary>
