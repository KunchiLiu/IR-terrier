	<detailed_description>Rotaviruses lead cause severe , dehydrate diarrhea relate death child age less 5 year worldwide report infect nearly every child age 5 year . About 90 % rotavirus-associated fatality occur low income country Africa Asia relate poor health care . In low income country Asia Africa , rotavirus epidemiology characterize one period relatively intense rotavirus circulation background year-round transmission , whereas high income country temperate climate distinct winter seasonality typically observe . In 2008 , WHO estimate approximately 453,000 ( 420,000-494,000 ) rotavirus gastroenteritis ( RVGE ) associate child death worldwide . These fatality account 5 % child death cause-specific mortality rate 86 death per 100,000 population age less 5 year . In view high global RVGE burden , World Health Organization ( WHO ) 5th June 2009 , recommend inclusion rotavirus vaccine national immunization program . As Asian country , Rotavirus infection significant cause illness hospitalization Bangladesh approximately 2.4 million case report every year nearly two-thirds diarrhea-related hospitalization child age 5 . While progress make reduce diarrhea-related death among child , still one leading cause illness among child 5 Bangladesh . About half rotavirus hospitalization among infant age 6-11 month , Rotavirus vaccine could powerful public health impact introduce Bangladesh 's national immunization program . The basis develop rotavirus vaccine rest observation wild-type rotavirus infection immunize child subsequent disease . The immunity wild-type infection prevent subsequent infection ; however , provide nearly complete protection severe disease substantial protection mild disease . The five prevalent rotavirus genotype/serotype combination G1P1A [ 8 ] , G2P1B [ 4 ] , G3P1A [ 8 ] , G4P1A [ 8 ] , G9P1A [ 8 ] . Currently , RotaTeq® Rotarix® two WHO prequalified vaccine stable recommended duration storage temperature 2-8 °C . Studies indicate currently available vaccine , example RotaTeq® , inadvertently expose stored temperature 8 °C , potency maintain maximum exposure 48 hour 9 °C 25 °C bare 12 hour 26 °C 30 °C . However , RotaTeq® vaccine expose temperature 30 °C , vaccine discard due lose potency . There limited data suggest vaccine inadvertently expose temperature 0 °C , potency vaccine maintain . Another , currently available freeze dry vaccine i.e . Rotarix® vaccine exhibit stability shelf life 36 month 2 °C 8 °C . Hence vaccine possess enough thermostability profile suitable storage outside cold chain meaningful amount time need store transported refrigeration . It difficult maintain cold chain require conserve vaccine potency particularly develop low income country , result large amount vaccine waste bad case scenario , provide protection rotavirus infection potential recipient . Many exist vaccine exhibit degree thermostability , however , exist license vaccine possess short period thermostability ( e.g . VVM 7 VVM 14 ) fail address issue develop country especially region extreme climatic condition , reach 40 °C . Heat Stable Rotavirus Vaccine lyophilize heat stable rotavirus vaccine comprise five live reassortant rotaviruses RotaTeq® . The parent strain reassortants isolated human bovine host . Four reassortant rotaviruses express one outer capsid protein ( G1 , G2 , G3 , G4 ) human rotavirus parent strain attachment protein ( P7 ) bovine rotavirus parent strain . The fifth reassortant virus express attachment protein , P1A ( genotype P [ 8 ] ) , refer P1 [ 8 ] , human rotavirus parent strain outer capsid protein G6 bovine rotavirus parent strain . These reassortants suspend stabilizer solution lyophilize obtain thermostable cake . This lyophilized cake reconstitute use reconstitution buffer . There preservatives thimerosal present vaccine . The new heat stable rotavirus vaccine ( HSRV ) formulation offer high titer value even extreme temperature condition 45 °C prolong period time . This new heat stable formulation ( HSRV ) could transport non-refrigerated supply chain significantly reduce cost complication associate transport vaccine remote corner develop world . The bulk reassortants virus procure directly Merck Co. , USA , currently license USA many country liquid formulation RotaTeq® , offer easy regulatory path new heat-stable rotavirus vaccine licensure &amp; WHO prequalification . Heat-stable rotavirus vaccine ( HSRV ) potential sustain high temperature frequently encounter region majority rotavirus burden exist potential partially completely eliminate cold chain dependence . The aim current study ass safety reactogenicity single dose Hilleman Labs . ' oral live attenuate HSRV vaccine healthy adult age 18 year 45 year follow safety &amp; immunogenicity evaluation infant population 6-8 week age . In current study , adult subject either receive single dose oral live attenuate HSRV vaccine placebo Day 0 . There safety follow-up subject period 14 day vaccination . The investigator intend establish safety HSRV healthy adult prior test infant population . Acceptable safety data adult cohort allow enrolment subject infant cohort , approval study DSMB .</detailed_description>
