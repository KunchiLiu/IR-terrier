	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess initial tolerability , safety recommend phase 2 dose vedolizumab intravenous ( IV ) administer Graft-Versus-Host Disease ( GvHD ) prophylaxis along standard GvHD prophylaxis therapy ( participant undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [ allo-HSCT ] ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Finding Study Vedolizumab Graft-Versus-Host Disease ( GvHD ) Participants Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call Vedolizumab . Vedolizumab ( also call MLN0002 ) approve treatment adult participant moderately severely active UC CD achieve inadequate response , loss response , intolerant conventional and/or biologic treatment . This study look tolerability pharmacokinetics Vedolizumab participant undergo allo-HSCT added standard GvHD prophylaxis ( tacrolimus plus short-term methotrexate ) prevention acute GvHD ( major complication allo-HSCT ) . The study enroll approximately 36 participant . Participants assign different dose-escalating cohort order find recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) study : - Cohort 1 : Vedolizumab 75 mg - Cohort 2 : Vedolizumab 300 mg - Cohort 3 : Vedolizumab Dose 1 All participant receive 1 injection Vedolizumab Day -1 allo-HSCT Days 13 42 allo-HSCT . If none participant receive vedolizumab 75 mg experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , dose escalation continue 300 mg Day -1 allo-HSCT Days +13 +42 allo-HSCT . If first 3 participant 300 mg tolerate treatment without experience DLTs , decision whether increase vedolizumab IV dose next cohort guide PK result . Cohorts escalate manner identification RP2D . The cohort dose level may expand include approximately 18 additional participant undergo myeloablative condition reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) receive either relate unrelated allo-HSCT treatment hematologic malignancy myeloproliferative neoplasms . This group participants allow assessment tolerability clinical activity vedolizumab . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study approximately 2 year . Following treatment period , participant remain remission follow development acute chronic GvHD safety clinic visit 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 12 month allo-HSCT death withdrawal consent termination study sponsor . Participants complete study attend 12-month follow-up visit . Patients discontinue treatment attend end treatment visit 30 40 day last dose study drug use study procedure outline 12-month follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
