	<brief_title>The Importance Albumin Infusion Rate Plasma Volume Expansion Following Major Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major surgery one many trigger systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , disrupt normal regulation transcapillary fluid exchange tissue oedema hypovolemia consequence . Hypovolemia amplify inflammatory reaction reduce cardiac output oxygen delivery , create vicious circle . Fluid therapy therefore cornerstone perioperative treatment patient subject major surgery . However , even fluid therapy life save also associate side effect oedema formation , coagulopathy endothelial dysfunction . From clinical perspective , therefore important fluid administer antagonize hypovolemia far possible remain intravascularly . Colloids macromolecule vessel wall low permeability proponent colloid contain fluid argue less volume require equal plasma volume compare crystalloids . However , extravasation colloid function vessel wall permeability also dependent volume fluid filter across vascular wall , turn depend trans-capillary hydrostatic pressure . This mean administration colloid way minimize increase capillary pressure could important plasma volume expand effect . In support hypothesis experimental result plasma volume expansion colloidal solution affect rate administration ( Bark et al. , 2013 ) . If find prof valid also clinical setting , important colloidal solution prescribe clinic may change current clinical practice suspect hypovolemia often treated bolus infusion fluid . This study intend investigate whether finding reproduce so-called Whipple 's operation major gynaecological cancer surgery . Study patient study procedure large standardized operation trigger inflammatory condition capillary leakage therefore consider model major surgical procedure well ICU patient SIRS trigger example sepsis .</detailed_description>
