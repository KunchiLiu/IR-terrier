	<brief_summary>The aim investigation longitudinally quantify host gene expression serum proteins child infectious non-infectious SIRS . The investigator hypothesize child non-infectious SIRS , bacterial infection associate SIRS , viral infection associate SIRS exhibit distinct pattern host gene expression serum protein . The investigator hypothesize possible discover set mRNA protein biomarkers permit unambiguous diagnosis non-infectious SIRS , SIRS associate bacterial infection , SIRS associate viral infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake proof-of-concept , pilot , prospective , observational trial aim recruit ~90 child Seattle Children 's Hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) . The study plan recruit 30 child schedule surgery repair congenital cardiac malformation , 15 - 25 immunocompetent child culture positive sepsis , 15 - 25 immunocompromised child culture positive sepsis , 30-40 child polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) positive viral respiratory pathogen ( RSV , influenza , parainfluenza , rhinovirus , etc ) , meet eligibility criterion . In total , accounting culture negative bacterial sepsis ( estimate 40 % ) , investigator plan enroll 50 child sepsis , 30-40 viral sepsis , 20 child undergo surgery congenital heart disease . Demographic data collect time ICU admission . Illness severity quantify PRISM III day 1 PELOD score . Additional measure sepsis severity include oxygenation index , saturation index duration mechanical ventilation , vasoactive inotropic score duration vasoactive-inotropic support high serum creatinine day 1 . Resource utilization measure PICU hospital duration stay . For child enrol study , blood sample obtain study day 1 , 2 3 . For child sepsis , culture remain sterile PCR negative , additional research blood sample obtain . For child sepsis positive culture positive PCR study day 3 , additional blood sample obtain day PICU discharge .</detailed_description>
