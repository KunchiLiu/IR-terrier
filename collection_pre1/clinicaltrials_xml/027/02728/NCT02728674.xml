	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . An American randomize web-based study show important difference diagnosis COPD among female male patients.Women likely misdiagnosed chronic cough asthma instead COPD physician reluctant refer woman spirometry.This importance treatment follow-up differ condition . Breathlessness , subjective experience breathe discomfort , cardinal symptom cardiac pulmonary disease . In advanced COPD , 98 % patient experience breathlessness persist rest minimal exertion , despite optimal treatment underlie disease ( chronic refractory breathlessness ) . Dyspnea link reduced physical activity , worsen deconditioning , increase anxiety depression , impaired quality life , loss live near death , increase risk hospitalization , early death . The preferred treatment relief chronic refractory breathlessness systemic ( oral parenteral ) low dose opioid ( Level I evidence ) . In recent meta-analysis 16 study ( 271 patient total ) , low dose opioids reduce chronic refractory breathlessness advance COPD , without report serious adverse effect . Lower dose opioids associate increase risk admission hospital death large register-based Swedish study 2,249 patient oxygen-dependent COPD patient treat low dose opioids ( â‰¤ 30mg oral morphine/day ) . Despite grow evidence support use opioids , physician reluctant prescribe low dose opioids breathlessness COPD . In review 2000 random dispense opioid prescription among patient advanced COPD , suffer severe chronic breathlessness , common state indication pain ( 97 % ) , 2 % breathlessness . In survey , Dutch chest physician reluctant prescribe opioids refractory breathlessness advance COPD due perceive resistance patient fear adverse effect , include respiratory depression . Qualitative study Canada show physician pulmonary medicine primary care , family patient feel low dose opioids helpful relief breathlessness , treatment delayed avoid due lack guideline , lack related knowledge experience opioids , fear related potential adverse effect legal censure . No randomized trial compare physician assess treat refractory breathlessness versus refractory pain , often opioids consider treatment breathlessness factor affect choice treatment chronic breathlessness compare pain advanced COPD . Furthermore , remain unknown gender bias diagnosis COPD among physician treat COPD patient . METHOD : This randomize , triple-blind , parallel group- , web-based study base survey instrument answer certified physician treat patient respiratory problem Sweden . The survey base upon hypothetical patient case regard situation consideration part physician ' daily clinical management treatment COPD patient . Two randomization take place regard hypothetical case 1 ) Sex 2 ) Symptom . The participant show hypothetical patient case randomize ( 1:1:1:1 ) regard sex symptom one four potential case scenario : man+breathlessness ; man+pain ; woman+breathlessness ; woman+pain . AIM : The aim study determine gender bias diagnosis COPD ; often physicians identify chronic refractory breathlessness require treatment compare refractory pain , symptomatic treatment consider focus morphine ; explore physician perception regard grade evidence different treatment relief chronic breathlessness ; examine factor affect physician decision treat refractory breathlessness opioids .</detailed_description>
