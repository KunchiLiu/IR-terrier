	<brief_summary>The study undertake three German neurosurgical center ( Ulm , Mainz , Stuttgart ) March 2014 March 2015 . Inclusion criterion age ≥ 18 ≤ 80 , diagnosis glioma WHO° II-IV , absence aphasia impair communication consent . In outpatient set eligible patient gliomas screen distress ( Distress Thermometer ( DT ) ) need psychosocial support ( Supportive Care Needs Survey-SF34-G ( SCNS ) ) . Simultaneously HRQoL assess ( EORTC QLQ-C30+BN-20 Vers . 3 ) . Patients different disease stage ask fill questionnaire . At two study center patient ask complete questionnaire prior appointment personal instruction randomly select case . At third study center , complete questionnaire outpatient appointment personal aid instruction . At time investigation , patient different stage treatment ( chemotherapy , radiation , re-chemotherapy , re-radiation , none , etc . ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design In three neuro-oncological outpatient department three study center ( two university medical center , one teaching hospital ) , glioma patient assess March 2014 March 2015 use three questionnaire . Due infrastructure outpatient department , assess ment supportive care need , HRQoL , distress , questionnaires perform either opportunity personal support study member ( group A ) patient alone ( group B ) . In group A , member study group ( caregiver ) offer help stay patient whole time patient filling questionnaire . Every patient receive explanation offer additional support . If question occur patient able fill questionnaires him-/herself , study member help answer question , assist describe questionnaire detail even read question patient fill answer choose patient . The extent assistance study member vary depend impairment patient . Occurrence detail difficulty completion assess feedback form especially develop study filled member study group complete instrument . If patient unable complete questionnaire , reason document interviewer ( e.g . neurocognitive impairment , physical disability , decrease attention span , etc . base categorized clinical judgement interviewer ) . In group B , patient complete questionnaire . In one study center , Allocation study group randomize one study center ( block randomization independently provide Institute Medical Biostatistics , Mainz ) . Patients two center either always group A always group B . Furthermore , socio-demographic data , tumor stage , Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) , pre-and postsurgical clinical characteristic ( e.g . postoperative tumor remnant , localization tumor ) , adjuvant therapy document . The study undertaken concordance national law , institutional ethical standard Helsinki Declaration , ethic commission three study center approve study . Patient population Selection criterion study : 1. glial cerebral tumor ( astrocytoma , oligoastrocytoma , oligodendroglioma , glioblastoma ) , diagnose local neuro- pathologist study center ; 2. patient affiliate neuro-oncological outpatient center one three study center ; 3. patient able understand respond question ; 4. informed consent patient . PRO Questionnaires For first assessment , SCNS-SF34-G , Distress Thermometer ( DT ) , EORTC -QLQ- C30 + EORTC QLQ-BN20 use , second assessment 3-5 month SCNS-ST9 , DT , EORTC-QLQ-C30 + EORTC QLQ-BN-20 use . The SCNS-SF34 , short-form version SCNS long-form , self-reporting instrument measure patient ' need supportive care . It consist five domain : health system information , psychological , physical daily living , patient care support , sexuality need . Lehmann et al . demonstrated adequate psychometric property German version . On 5-point Likert scale , patient indicate need support , , extent need ( 1 = need , applicable ; 2 = need , satisfy ; 3 = low need ; 4 = moderate need ; 5 = high need ) . The SCNS-SF9 ultrashort screen instrument develop SCNS-SF34 consist nine question . The structure screen instrument similar SCNS-SF34-G 5-point Likert scale described . The EORTC QLQ-C30 frequently use questionnaire include 30 item assess quality life oncological patient include five functional score ( physical , role , emotional , social , cognitive function ) . The reliability validity instrument approve many clinical trial , translate 85 language . The brain module ( QLQ-BN20 ) comprise 20 question develop brain tumor patient include four functional scale . The Distress Thermometer ( DT ) , self-reporting instrument , evaluate psychological distress use visual analogue scale along 40 item assess financial , physical , emotional spiritual concern ( problem list ) . Developed National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) , German version adapt 2007 . A score six visual analogue scale recommend cut-off clinically significant level distress brain tumor patient . The DT well accept oncological patient . Endpoints The primary evaluation feasibility questionnaires clinical routine analyze analyze occurrence miss value occurrence error SCNS-SF34-G SCNS-ST9 . Missing value assess category single miss item ( least one item per questionnaire miss ) miss questionnaire ( complete questionnaire fill ) . An error define multiple response item one response per patient would correct . For outcomes comparison make EORTC QLQ-C30+BN20 DT well group A B . The study member provide support patient group A give feasibility feedback regard difficulty occur assessment patient use 10-item feedback form develop study follow item : - Occurrence difficulty ( yes/no ) - Time need assessment ( 10-20min , 21-30min , 31-40min , 41-50 min , &gt; 51min ) - Impairment patient ( none , cognitive , psychological , physical ) - If problem assessment occur ( none/rare/moderate/severe ; define frequency question ask patient ) - Which difficulty occur ( understand questionnaire/complexity questionnaire/extend questions/physical problem e.g . paresis ) - Which questionnaire cause problem ( EORTC/DT/SCNS ) - Which questionnaires fill with/without assistance - Aid intensity level provide study member ( assistance one , two three questionnaire ) . Where possible item also analyze comparison PRO instrument . Difficulties occur SCNS compare EORTC QLQ-C30+BN20 DT whenever possible .</detailed_description>
