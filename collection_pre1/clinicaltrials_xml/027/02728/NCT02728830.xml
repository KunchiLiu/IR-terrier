	<brief_title>A Study Pembrolizumab Tumoral Immunoprofile Gynecologic Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial gynecologic malignancy tumor müllerian origin , include ovarian , endometrial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer , account &gt; 70,000 new diagnosis &gt; 22,000 death per year United States alone . Treatment typically consist thorough cytoreductive staging surgery combination platinum/taxane chemotherapy . Newer approach add anti-angiogenic therapy chemotherapy result moderate improvement recurrence free survival . However , despite aggressive treatment , majority woman advance stage diagnosis experience relapse . Unfortunately , relapse disease incurable woman ultimately die disease despite maximal effort cancer control use subsequent chemotherapy target agent . There significant interest incorporate immune checkpoint therapy treatment gynecologic malignancy , especially give durable remission associate therapy treatment melanoma early indication durable response recurrent ovarian cancer . At time , little known whether combine chemotherapy , anti-angiogenic therapy , immunologic therapy maximal benefit . Understanding tumor microenvironment , particularly immune angiogenic factor contribute tumor survival , well change occur response immunotherapy critical identify favorable biomarker profile could lead improve prognostic outcome inform development sequence therapy maximize benefit .</detailed_description>

Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal direct bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal 7f . AST ALT ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ≤ 5 time upper limit normal subject liver metastases 7g . Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL 7h . International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant 7i . Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant 8 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 9 . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity plan hysterectomy/oophorectomy . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week study drug administration . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior study drug administration . 3 . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) 4 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 5 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 6 . Has receive prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy current gynecologic malignancy . NOTE : Subjects receive treatment prior unrelated malignancy must recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . NOTE : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 7 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy , situ cervical cancer . 8 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior study drug administration neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior study drug administration . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 9 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) .
