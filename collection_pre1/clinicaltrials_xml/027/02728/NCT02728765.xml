	<brief_summary>To study frequency obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment response patient non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . It hypothesize CPAP treatment may improve activity NAFLD concomitant OSA . A screening study OSA follow randomize controlled trial patient biopsy proven NAFLD follow hepatology clinic . Home sleep study , Epworth sleepiness score ( ESS ) , pair proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , transient elastography fibroscan , serum cytokeratin-18 fragment , liver function test liver biopsy ( fibroscan evidence advance liver fibrosis ) . Patients confirm symptomatic OSA randomize receive auto CPAP subtherapeutic CPAP control 6 month . Primary outcome : change intrahepatic triglyceride content ( IHTG ) measure proton-MRS 6 month auto CPAP versus subtherapeutic CPAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators propose screen obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) perform home sleep study patient biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) follow Hepatology Clinic , Prince Wales Hospital , Hong Kong , phase one study . The following condition already exclude underlying cause liver disease specific NAFLD cohort : history excessive alcoholic consumption ( 30 g/day men 20 g/day woman ) , secondary cause hepatic steatosis ( chronic use systemic corticosteroid ) , positive hepatitis B surface antigen , anti-hepatitis C virus antibody , histological evidence concomitant chronic liver disease . OSA syndrome define apnoea-hypopnoea index ( AHI ) 5 per hour sleep plus excessive daytime sleepiness two follow symptom : choke gasp sleep , recurrent awakening sleep , unrefreshed sleep , daytime fatigue , impaired concentration . All patient suspect OSA undergo initial assessment respiratory clinic Epworth sleepiness score ( ESS ) symptoms evaluation . Patients ESS score &gt; 9 least two OSA symptom describe invited join phase two study . They invite undergo home sleep study . Those biopsy proven NAFLD AHIâ‰¥ 5/hr randomize either group A ) auto CPAP range 4-12 cmH20 group B ) Subtherapeutic CPAP auto CPAP fix 4 cmH20 balance block design third party involved trial .</detailed_description>
