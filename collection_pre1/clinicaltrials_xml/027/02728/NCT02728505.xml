	<brief_title>SinuSurf vs. Saline Solution Normal Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhinosinusitis , sinusitis , bacterial fungal infection sinus result build-up mucus , cause inflammation sinus cavity . NeilMed SinuSurf solution mucoactive surfactant design add NeilMed large-volume saline irrigation solution purpose improve clearance mucus cause sinusitis . In vitro study show topical surfactant therapy , SinuSurf , show efficacious treatment inflammation sinus ( rhinosinusitis ) . In particular , therapy show antimicrobial effect , include decrease number bacteria use alone elimination bacteria combine antibiotic . To date , initial safety study SinuSurf in-vitro model confirm lack toxicity ciliary beat frequency also lack toxicity nasal explants model . In comparative analysis saline surfactant irrigation post-operational endoscopic endonasal surgery subject , Farag , et al . find receive surfactant irrigation report side effect 20 % subject surfactant irrigation discontinue use compare none receive saline . Rohrer , et al . find surfactant , add saline , clear sinus space significantly good saline alone . A previous version SinuSurf market 2011-2012 ; however , remove market due anecdotal report concern regard pain , dryness , temporary alteration sense smell . While report permanent alteration sense smell receive , NeilMed wish assess tolerability safety revise , lower-concentration formulation SinuSurf prior re-introduction market . The purpose trial ass tolerability potential side effect profile , specifically alteration sense smell , revise , low-concentration sinus irrigation solution population normal subject . Healthy participant include study SinuSurf™ over-the-counter ( OTC ) product use symptom rather one particular disease , saline rinse . It over-the-counter product . One main outcome measure impact upon sense smell , already often compromised patient chronic nasal/sinus disease . Thus seek study patient normal smell also n't condition may impact sense smell , would potentially confound data interpretation . The dose/concentration patent , involve one squirt `` shampoo '' 240 cc buffer nasal saline . There anecdotal ( internet ) report patient may temporary smell loss criterion patient withdrawal possibly early study termination . The advice SinuSurf™ use 5 day order prevent patient medical condition evaluate physician defer medical advice . These warning typical counter product . In present study , product use physician 's oversight . The 7 day period choose full `` week '' conceivably time interval one would expect change outcome measure baseline .</detailed_description>
