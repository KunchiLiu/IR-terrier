	<brief_summary>Churg-Strauss syndrome rare autoimmune inflammatory disease affect medium- small-sized blood vessel , cause asthma , abnormality blood , lung disease , neuropathy . The main cause death patient heart attack . Without therapy , 5-year survival patient Churg-Strauss syndrome 25 % . Although 5-year survival increase 62 % appropriate therapy , many patient remain refractory therapy . The long term outcome patient remain grim . The aim research study determine suppress immune system use combination high dose chemotherapy , antibody , radiation follow stem cell transplant abolish 'bad ' immune system let patient 's body establish new immune system attack blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Churg-Strauss syndrome rare autoimmune inflammatory disease affect medium- small-sized artery vein closely related Wegener 's granulomatosis . It also one disease associated antibody neutrophils cytoplasmic antigen ( ANCAs ) . Patients Churg-Strauss syndrome often present refractory asthma , eosinophilia , pulmonary infiltrates mononeuritis multiplex . Corticosteroids remain first line therapy patient patient respond corticosteroid therapy . However , small proportion patient need immunosuppressive agent cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine A , Rituximab , azathioprine . Still number patient remain refractory extremely dependent high dose corticosteroid . The principal cause mortality patient myocarditis myocardial infarction due coronary arteritis . Without therapy , 5-year survival patient Churg-Strauss syndrome 25 % . Although 5-year survival increase 62 % appropriate therapy , many patient remain refractory therapy . The long term outcome patient remain grim . In study , investigator hypothesize addition total lymphatic irradiation combination high dose cyclophosphamide antithymocyte globulin give safely patient induce disease remission patient refractory Churg-Strauss syndrome , would also induce sustain long period medication-free remission patient . Since combination preparative regimen never use previously , investigator test hypothesis pilot study .</detailed_description>
