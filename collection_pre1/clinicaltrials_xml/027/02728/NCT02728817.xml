	<brief_summary>The Radial Artery Deviation And Reimplantation ( RADAR ) technique new approach construction hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula . In technique , radial artery pedicle deviate towards minimally dissect cephalic vein wrist . The aim study compare safety efficacy technique traditional end-cephalic side-radial arteriovenous fistula , currently use first line vascular access hemodialysis patient . The hypothesis minimal dissection concept use RADAR inhibit venous juxta-anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia stenosis , lead high rate maturation patency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Radial Artery Deviation And Reimplantation Technique Primary Hemodialysis Access Creation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current nephrology vascular surgery guideline , end-cephalic side-radial arteriovenous fistula gold standard primary vascular access creation . However , wrist AVFs recognize bad patency autogenous vascular access . Outcome improvement therefore urgent field vascular access , concern grow incident population patient end-stage renal disease require hemodialysis . Primary AVF failure , include failure mature , occur ~35-40 % first year , generally due juxta-anastomotic stenosis . Many AVF subsequently require additional intervention mature successfully . The primary patency AVFs poor 55 % 12 month . Juxta-anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia typically occur swing segment , e.g . proximal vein mobilize form end-to-side anastomosis . This surgically-mobilized segment coincides turbulent flow well devascularization vas vasorum . These process associate endothelial cell activation dysfunctional phenotype . Therefore investigator hypothesize surgical technique minimize venous dissection may improve fistula maturation access patency . Accordingly , investigator develop `` Radial Artery Deviation And Reimplantation ( RADAR ) technique . '' Instead use traditional end-vein side-artery anastomosis , RADAR use end-artery side-vein anastomosis , additionally couple minimal vessel dissection . Investigators extend conventional `` touch '' technique advocate avoidance venous dissection manipulation . Investigators minimize arterial dissection well , dissect radial artery pedicle , artery . The aim study compare safety efficacy novel technique traditional radial-cephalic fistula set multicenter randomize control trial . Besides traditional endpoint patency reintervention rate , hand blood perfusion assess objective measurement .</detailed_description>
