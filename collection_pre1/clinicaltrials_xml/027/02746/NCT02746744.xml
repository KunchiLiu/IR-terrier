	<brief_title>RItuximab Versus FUmarate Newly Diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomise phase 3 study compare novel treatment protocol Rituximab present first line disease modify drug regard clinical , radiological biochemical parameter . This measure via clinical investigation , MRI Cerebrospinal fluid analysis . Each patient one treating physician responsible ongoing medical question decision regard continuation study one examine physician performing blind Expanded Disability Status Scale examination assessment exacerbation . The coordinate nurse administer study-related test administer rituximab infusion . In order keep examine physician blind patient receive disease modify drug receive infusion sodium chloride solution interval rituximab arm receiving . In instance opaque cover bag shield content infusion solution . In case examine physician able identify rituximab patient case accidental meeting neurology unit . Randomisation perform via randomisation module national Swedish MS registry . The patient randomise 1:1 ratio receive treatment accordance clinical practice . Thus , study mimic real-life situation treatment administer involves positive negative consequence . As positive consequence result study high degree validity relation expect outcome clinical practice . As negative consequence may psychological effect know medication one receiving . Since drug probably perceive positive treatment option MS today unlikely predominant placebo effect either treatment option .</detailed_description>
