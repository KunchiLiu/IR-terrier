	<brief_summary>Background ( brief ) : 1 . Burden : Excessive salinity common groundwater aquifer across south-western coastal Bangladesh . Higher adult mean systolic diastolic blood pressure increase risk gestational hypertension observe among drank tube-well water high sodium content . 2 . Knowledge gap : Managed Aquifer Recharge ( MAR ) system , inject freshwater shallow aquifer , reduce drink water salinity , successfully instal south-western area , provide year-round freshwater . However , health benefit risk MAR water measure . 3 . Relevance : If drinking MAR water reduce hypertension adult pregnant woman , show minimal risk microbiological chemical contamination , scale consider . Hypothesis ( ) : Mean systolic diastolic blood pressure lower among adult population drink MAR water compare people drink saline brackish groundwater Objectives : To determine 1 . If provide access MAR water drink food preparation reduce blood pressure among adult population &gt; 20 year age . 2 . If provide access MAR water drink food preparation pregnancy reduce blood pressure among pregnant woman . 3 . If MAR water contaminate E coli fecal coliforms . 4 . Whether MAR water contaminate dissolved constituent mobilize aquifer sediment know harmful human health . Methods : A stepped-wedge RCT conduct among community intervention roll . Study investigator collect baseline information site first monthly block ( step ) one drink MAR water . There promoter convey message regard exclusive use MAR water drink cooking , home elsewhere . Measurements make trained research assistant every month . MAR water , pond water , groundwater household store water sample collect tested every month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study site : The propose study stepped-wedge RCT implement 20 MAR community All 20 MAR community gradually access MAR water , access different time period step . Therefore , MAR site contribute data intervention control time period . There five , monthly step step wedge trial . In first monthly step , none community MAR water available drinking baseline information collect community . During subsequent month , five MAR community randomly assign receive intervention . In last ( fifth ) monthly step , communities access MAR drinking water . Blood pressure enrol participant measured step . Animal human study suggest change salt load change blood pressure within hour , meta-analysis randomized trial suggest modest reduction salt intake four week cause significant reduction blood pressure population-level . Therefore , investigator use interval least one month access MAR water first post-intervention blood pressure measurement , two consecutive blood pressure measurement . This study protocol approve icddr , b Ethical Review Committee . Informed write consent take participant household head . Site selection randomization : The 30 MAR community ready roll intervention ( access MAR water community ) locate rural area three district 20 MAR community reach effectively base geographical location select . Water sample select 20 MAR site collect every month one year June , 2016 May , 2017 capture seasonal variation microbiological chemical water quality . Human health data biological specimen enrol participant within catchment area select 20 site collect December , 2016 May , 2017 . Sample Size Calculation The sample size step wedge trial calculate base primary objective : reduction systolic blood pressure . Data southwest Bangladesh suggest 7 mmHg low mean systolic blood pressure among pregnant woman drink pond water compare drank brackish water , 17 mmHg low mean systolic blood pressure pregnant woman drink rainwater compare drank brackish water . The mean reduction systolic blood pressure follow long term modest salt reduction 4.2 mmHg . At least three mmHg systolic blood pressure reduction consider current study among community access MAR water drink cooking purpose compare use brackish water . The entire population catchment area MAR community consider one cluster . Each MAR community serve approximately 300 people , constitute 60-70 household catchment area . The mean household size southwest coastal Bangladesh 4.2 ; approximately 52 % household member ≥ 20 year . Since blood pressure collect household member ≥ 20 year , average 2.2 participant estimate age group per household . About 28 household per cluster ( 28 *2.2 = 60 people per cluster ) select study . A previously publish study Bangladesh report standard deviation ( SD ) systolic blood pressure 13.51 . The sample size step wedge trial estimate adopt formula use Woertman et al . 2013 Hemming et al . 2015 . Woertman et al . propose usual approach initially calculate sample size simple unadjusted trial ( NU ) , multiply design effect step wedge trial ( DESW ) . The sample size simple unadjusted trial 1,868 participant ( effect size= 3 , standard deviation 20 group , 80 % power , 5 % Type I error ) . The DESW 3.046 base formula provide Woertman et al 2013 . Considering fixed cluster size 60 5 % loss-to-follow , propose study need 20 MAR community , five community randomize access MAR water step . Sample size calculation pregnant woman : The mean SBP pregnant woman south-western coastal Bangladesh 102.4 mmHg among individual drank rainwater , 112.7 mmHg among filter user , 112.6 among pond water user 119.4 among brackish groundwater user ( tube-well water ) . The investigator assume drink tube-well water may correspond dry season information rainwater data correspond wet season information . Therefore , assumption drinking MAR water would able reduce 17 mm Hg systolic blood pressure . Considering crude birth rate 26/1000 population , assumption may 88 birth seven month duration propose study . Considering 88 pregnancy , investigator 95 % power detect effect MAR main study . Stata command : sampsi 119.4 102.4 , sd1 ( 26.7 ) sd2 ( 16.2 ) n1 ( 44 ) n2 ( 44 ) Data Analysis Blood Pressure The investigator conduct intention-to-treat analysis . Since data longitudinal individual participant , generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) use appropriate autoregressive correlation structure , account repeated measure within individual study participant , robust standard error allow possible misspecification variance structure . The outcome continuous blood pressure , regress indicator variable access MAR water , dummy variable study site account mean difference community ... The interpretation GEE model 's output population average association MAR blood pressure , conditional study site . The study investigator adjust age , sex , body mass index , smoking , alcohol intake , family history hypertension , hypertensive medication participant . In secondary analysis , association drinking MAR water urinary sodium protein concentration evaluate . For pregnant woman , control gestational week . Water Quality Metrics T-test do compare microbial water quality measure mean log10 MPN count/100 ml water monthly step MAR water nearby pond water sample . The investigator determine whether concentration chemical constituent water sample monthly step exceed WHO recommend level . We use similar GEE model outcomes log10 MPN count/100 ml water , natural log-transformed ( skew ) concentration chemical constituent water . Referral hypertensive patients- If research staff member identify hypertensive patient case hypertensive disorder pregnancy , refer patient government health facility management . In addition , research staff train pregnant woman family member recognize danger sign pregnancy , also instruct seek medical care danger sign appear . During household visit research staff encourage pregnant woman attend prenatal visit . Data management All data protect confidentially delinked personal information dataset use analysis . The delinked dataset publicly available follow publication primary result trial .
