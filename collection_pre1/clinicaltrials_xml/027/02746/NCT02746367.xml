	<brief_title>Bipolar Proteomic Assay Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This hypothesis-driven confirmatory study validate diagnostic signature ( model ) distinguish BDI MDD also aim optimize model discriminate BDII MDD BDI . A binary classification model , use linear discriminant analysis base 13 priori-defined proteomic marker aim distinguish BDI MDD . An alternative binary classification model base multiple logistic regression use 10 priori -defined proteomic marker aim result . To improve predictive performance signature , item self-report mood rating scale treatment-emergent change proteomic marker analyze . In addition , study examine baseline early treatment-emergent change proteomic marker predict treatment response .</detailed_description>
