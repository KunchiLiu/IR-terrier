	<criteria>Male female patient ≥ 18 year age Patients histologically confirm solid tumor : Tumor must harbor IDH1R132X mutation Disease must evaluable per RECIST 1.1 RANO ( glioma ) Patients advanced cancer refractory , demonstrate intolerance , refuse access , available standard therapy Glioma patient must complete chemoradiotherapy least 12 week prior screen baseline scan Patient must able provide formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue specimen prior treatment . The specimen may take time course disease may primary tumor metastasis Patient must able take oral medication comply protocol procedure schedule visit Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 Negative serum urine pregnancy test must obtain within 7 day prior first dose study drug woman childbearing potential . Negative result must available prior study drug administration . Sexually active woman men reproductive potential must agree use highly effective contraception . This apply period signing informed consent 3 month last administration study drug . These procedure document source document . The investigator designate associate request advise patient achieve highly effective birth control . Highly effective contraception include : Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception Placement certain intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Hysterectomy , vasectomy partner ( provided partner sole sexual partner woman childbearing potential trial participant vasectomize partner receive medical assessment surgical success ) In addition , use condom patient partner required Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . A sign informed consent , include consent biomarker analysis , must obtain prior studyspecific procedure . Adequate blood clotting define international normalized ratio ( INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.5 time ULN ( patient anticoagulation agent Coumadin heparin Xarelto allow participate provide prior evidence underlie abnormality parameter exist ) . For patient warfarin , close monitoring least weekly evaluation perform INR stable base measurement predose , define local standard care Adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function assess bythe follow laboratory requirement conduct within 7 day prior first dose study drug : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL ; Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5*109/L ; Platelet count ≥ 100*109/L . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . For intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( IHCC ) patient , total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 time ULN acceptable Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 time ULN ( ≤ 5 time ULN patient impair liver function due metastatic disease ) Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ≥ 50 mL/min per 1.73 m2 accord Modification Diet Renal Disease Study Group ( MDRD ) formula Known hypersensitivity study drug excipients preparation agent give association study History cardiac disease , include congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class &gt; II , unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) newonset angina ( within 6 month prior study entry ) , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy except betablockers digoxin ; evidence uncontrolled coronary artery disease ( e.g . angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , major regional wall motion abnormality upon baseline echocardiography ) . Patients pacemaker also exclude . Left ventricle ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % measure echocardiography perform Screening Uncontrolled hypertension define systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg , despite medical management Patients active clinically significant infection National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grade ≥ 2 Previous coexist cancer ( ) distinct primary site histology cancer evaluate study EXCEPT : Appropriately treat cervical cancer insitu , nonmelanoma skin cancer , superficial bladder tumor ( Ta Tis ) Any cancer curatively treat least 3 year entry study Unresolved specific chronic toxicity previous treatment grade &gt; 1 except alopecia hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL ( ≥5.6 mmol/L ) .
