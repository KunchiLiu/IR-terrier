	<brief_title>Intention Prescribe/Take OAC Depending Number Risk Diagrams , Period Estimation Risk .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To answer question : 1 . Concerning decision prescribe ( take ) treatment basis decision aid , necessary diagram ( risk without treatment , risk treatment ) , enough second ( risk treatment , normally give need information ) ? 2 . Concerning decision prescribe ( take ) treatment , difference effect presentation decision aid risk stroke next 1 year , presentation estimate risk stroke next 5 year ? 3 . Is decision different physician prescribe anticoagulant treatment patient , take ? Study : 2x3 factorial randomize control trial ( RCT ) comparison : 1 . Between decision aid 2 image ( without treatment + treatment ) one 1 image ( risk treatment ) 2 . Between effect presentation stroke risk chart 1 year stroke risk chart 5 year . 3 . The decision prescribe patient decision take treatment . The comparison make spectrum risk ( score CHA2DS2-VASC ) 1-5 . Sample size : calculate sample 948 participant ( 474 + 474 ) p = 0.05 , power = 80 % statistical difference decision 5 % ( 95 % 90 % ) . The study enough power neither compare 5 group CHA2DS2-VASC ( make comparison exploratory purpose ) , test interaction . Participants : physician participate National Congress Internal Medicine , physicians participate course , professional manifestation . Randomization : randomization do graph type ( 1 2 picture ) , duration risk estimate ( 1 year 5 year ) size CHA2DS2-VASC risk score ( 1 5 ) , target prescription ( patient doctor ) , total 40 possibility . Randomization do block 40 . Participants ask decide , depend risk chart , patient ( ) treat , ignore risk bleeding . The chart contain pictogram accord CHA2DS2-VASC risk score , without communicate actual score , physician make decision treat , depend perceive risk , treatment guideline . No . questionnaire : first digit = number risk diagram ( 1 2 ) ; second digit = number year risk stroke calculate ( 1 5 ) ; third digit = CHA2DS2-VASC score ( 1-5 ) . Ex : 253 : 2 decision aid diagram ( without treatment ) , estimate risk stroke next five year , patient CHA2DS2-VASC score =3 . Effect ( outcome ) : decision treat / treat patient / physician , oral anticoagulant . Statistical analysis : It look difference bivariate analysis , multivariate = logistic regression ( dependent variable = treatment decision , independent variable = number chart , period risk assessment ( one 5 year ) , prescription target ( patient physician ) , CHA2DS2-VASC score , time graduation , medical/teaching grade , work hospital / ambulatory , size city physician work , specialty , gender , age , physician has/had someone close stroke ( data questionnaire ) .</detailed_description>
