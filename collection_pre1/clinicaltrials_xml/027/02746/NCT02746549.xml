	<brief_summary>In study want compare accuracy two method measure renal perfusion MRI spin label technique : first measurement do 1.5 T MRI versus second one obtain 3.0 T MRI ( Siemens MRI device ) . Additionally want compare change renal perfusion cause physiological stress . The used stress test cold pressor test do forehead .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy 1.5 T Versus 3 T Magnetic Resonance Arterial Spin Labeling Measure Renal Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance imaging base arterial spin labeling technique measure renal blood flow . Renal perfusion measurement important tool analyze renal function detect acute kidney injury . The perfusion measurement base two data acquisition , one global inversion prepulse follow one slice selective prepulse ( FAIR ) . The prepulses lead label blood water spin . In contrast global inversion prepulse , slice selective inversion prepulse label blood water spin inside kidney inflowing blood water spin . Subtraction image therefore reflect local perfusion . A third image without FAIR preparation pulse measure normalize signal intensifier patient . MRI base arterial spin label noninvasive assessment use contrast agent measure functional parameter kidney . This avoid serious complication acute kidney failure nephrogenic systemic fibrosis . There know negative impact patient . In addition want analyze validity MRI‐technique provoke acutely change renal plasma flow . As provocative maneuver select cold pressor test physiological stress test . Forehead cool activates sympathetic nervous system increase blood pressure heart rate cause pain . This mechanism get impact renal haemodynamics . To minimize possible cold injury use 1°C ice water pack 60 second avoid contact eye . In study want compare accuracy two method measure renal perfusion MRI spin label technique : first measurement do 1.5 T MRI versus second one obtain 3.0 T MRI ( Siemens MRI device ) .</detailed_description>
