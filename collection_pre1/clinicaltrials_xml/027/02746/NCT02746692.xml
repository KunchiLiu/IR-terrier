	<brief_summary>Sports medical expert recommend considerable amount regular physical activity order improve strength , motor control , endurance flexibility . However , small share population able meet correspond international guideline . One reason suppose consist private scheduling problem high time expenditure . Against background , high-intensity intermittent training method short duration become popular . The present study aim evaluate effectivity high -intensity functional circuit training ( FIT15 program ) improve body function . Thirty healthy individual include randomize , control two-armed parallel group trial . In intervention group , participant perform FIT15 program , group-based high-intensity circuit training base functional movement pattern ( e.g . squat , push-ups , burpees , jump , rope-skipping ) . The training carry three time week , 15 minute total six week . In control group , participant exercise three time week ( total six week ) moderate intensity ergometer accord cardiopulmonary exercise guideline American College Sports Medicine . Outcomes assess prior follow six-week training period encompass body fat muscle mass ( bio impedance analysis ) , aerobic exercise capacity ( spirometric exercise test include lactate analysis ) , postural control ( force plate ) , maximum strength leg extensor shoulder muscle ( 1 repetition maximum ) psychometric variable ( e.g . physical activity readiness questionnaire ) .</brief_summary>
