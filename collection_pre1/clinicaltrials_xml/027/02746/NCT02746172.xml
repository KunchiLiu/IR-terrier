	<detailed_description>Optimising clinical fitting cochlear implant individual listener important aspect post-operative clinical care . The level success experience individual cochlear implant influence , significant extent , quality clinical programming audiologist . During clinical program audiologist typically measure amount electrical charge require elicit first hearing ( T-level ) provide loud comfortable percept ( C-level ) 22 electrode . The amount electrical stimulation require threshold comfortably loud percept varies across electrode array also across individual user . Appropriately set low upper electrical stimulation level vital ensure listener able detect reasonably soft sound whilst loud sound perceived loud remain comfortable . Achieving result across relevant frequency range prime aim programming . There number challenge achieve optimal fitting cochlear implant recipient clinical setting . First , vary skill level experience level health professional ally worker involve program device cochlear implant recipient , often result variability quality program ( MAP ) provide individual . Second , vary level access specialize equipment sound booth require type audiometric measure reliably obtain . Finally , increase demand clinical capacity , specialize centre typically treat recipient limited resource ability effectively manage rapidly increase population . As result , increase need effective , quality-controlled streamline management implanted recipient . The aim current study investigate potential use specific metric assess quality optimize individual 's cochlear implant fitting . Assessment sensitivity specificity specific metric potential predictor inaccurate T-levels C-levels important determine best method streamline high quality fitting , well automated adjustment optimize . One key objective integrate new technological advance form in-situ audiometry , remove need sound booth conduct audibility check program . Other planned investigation relate identify metric best identify map optimize , development assessment range technique may able effectively applied clinical setting .</detailed_description>
