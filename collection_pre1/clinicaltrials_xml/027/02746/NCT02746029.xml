	<brief_summary>Heart murmur commonly discover young child clinical encounter general practice . Heart murmur might signal structural cardiac disease need treat , atrial septal defect . Thus , child heart murmur routinely referred comprehensive cardiac examination paediatric hospital department feature echocardiography ( 'gold standard ' ) . However , great majority murmur innocent physiological ; ie. , represent cardiac disorder . The prevalence innocent murmur routine random auscultation estimate 30 % . It would advantageous patient heart disease great extent could identify general practitioner ' office : - Healthy child would expose comprehensive cardiac examination - The burden family would subside . - Scarce medical resource highly specialized department would well allocate , benefit patient real heart disease . The primary aim study establish predictive value cardiac marker child heart murmur . Secondary aim ) To pilot study pediatric cardiac ultrasound examination general practice ; b ) To establish age-adjusted reference range cardiac marker child , c ) To explore aspect cardiovascular physiology child . The investigator include total 500 child age 4 week 10 year consecutively refer Dept . Paediatrics , Akershus University Hospital , assessment heart murmur . All participant subject clinical examination , symptom assessment , pulse oximetry , blood sampling ( troponin T , proBNP biomarkers ) , ECG recording , echocardiography . A randomized subgroup child also undergo echocardiography perform general practitioner receive formal training pediatric cardiology . The value possible predictor assess construction Receiver Operating Characteristics ( ROC ) curve , calculation negative predictive value .</brief_summary>
