	<brief_summary>More 300,000 total knee joint replacement surgery perform per year United States safe , effective management post-operative pain patient , often elderly , deconditioned , obese , co-morbid disease like sleep apnea , challenge often require multidisciplinary , multimodal approach . Opiates mainstay treatment post-operative period vary degree success complication . Inadequately control postoperative pain uncommon . Poorly control pain inhibits early mobilization hinders post-operative physical therapy . A new paradigm treat post-operative pain follow total knee replacement may use cooled radiofrequency ablation ( C-RFA ) articular sensory nerve supply knee capsule prior surgery , desensitize knee block sensory afferent anterior capsule thereby decrease post-operative pain . There several publication demonstrate use RFA patient chronic knee pain osteoarthritis however use RFA preoperative management pain patient undergoing total knee joint replacement investigate . The aim study determine patient undergo unilateral total knee replacement obtain post-operative pain relieve benefit C-RFA articular sensory nerve supply perform prior surgery , compare sham control receive local anesthetic injection nerve without benefit ablation treatment .</brief_summary>
