	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy Catheter-based Renal Denervation Using Vessix™ Renal Denervation System Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) Patients With Severe Debilitating Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study employ Vessix Renal Denervation System ( Boston Scientific ) ablate renal nerve radio-ablation patient suffer severe pain due Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) . Twenty patient opiate-dependent , Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease-associated kidney pain select double-blind , prospective device study . Subjects randomly assign experimental ( receive nerve ablation ) control ( sham procedure ablation device turn ) group . Subjects complete physical exam administer questionnaire regard mental status pain , denervation procedure . Renal function adverse event monitor 1 year denervation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Diagnosis ADPKD ( meet Pei 's revised criteria24 ) . History chronic debilitate kidney pain &gt; 6 month due ADPKD . Other approach pain management appropriately consider used include step wise treatment nonopiates , opiate , physical therapy nonrenal cause pain effectively rule ( example : pancreatitis , cholecystitis , etc ) . Demonstrate either opiate dependence least 3 month , OR partial full medical disability OR selfreported significant decrease quality life OR minimum pain rating 7 10 three consecutive occasion screen intervention Patients must clinically able tolerate sedation procedure Must able travel study site . Able provide inform consent No renal artery stenosis &gt; 50 % presence suitable renal artery caliber ; 47mm identified time renal artery catheterization Sufficient renal image exclude genitourinary obstruction , tumor clinically significant pathology associate kidney pain . Stable renal function minimum 1 month prior study enrollment already dialysis No change antihypertensive therapy 1 month prior study enrollment Women childbearing potential must use least 2 acceptable form birth control Individual renal artery anatomy ineligible treatment include : Lacks least one renal artery kidney ≥ 4 mm diameter ≥ 20 mm treatable length prior significant arterial branch Renal artery stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) renal artery aneurysm renal artery intervention side A history prior renal artery intervention include balloon angioplasty stenting , prior renal denervation procedure . Renal artery contain calcification diffuse vessel abnormality allow least 4 ablation deliver Diffuse fibromuscular dysplasia allow least 4 ablation deliver ; define visible bead artery angiography Solitary horseshoe kidney The presence diabetes mellitus Individual ≥ 1 episode ( ) orthostatic hypotension relate medication change ( reduction systolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ≥10 mmHg within 3 minute stand ) , couple symptom , within past year screening process . Change systolic blood pressure associate symptom orthostasis Individual require chronic oxygen support mechanical ventilation nocturnal respiratory support sleep apnea . The presence primary pulmonary hypertension The presence know secondary form hypertension pheochromocytoma , Cushing 's Disease ( adrenal insufficiency ) , primary hyperaldosteronism , coarctation aorta . Individual experience myocardial infarction within 3 month screen period , experience unstable angina pectoris , syncope , cerebrovascular accident within 3 month screen period . Individual schedule plan surgery within 1 year study enrollment Inability complete protocol blood pressure measurement ( e.g. , arm diameter large cuff ) . Individual severe cardiac valve stenosis , opinion investigator , significant reduction blood pressure contraindicate . Subjects beta blocker clonidine Individual confound medical condition , opinion investigator , may adversely affect safety participant ( e.g. , significant peripheral vascular disease , abdominal aortic aneurysm , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ) Significant bleed diathesis ( thrombocytopenia , hemophilia , significant anemia ) Individual pregnant , nurse plan get pregnant within two year study enrollment . Individual known unresolved history drug use alcohol dependency , opinion Principal Investigator lack ability comprehend follow instruction , would unlikely unable , opinion investigator , comply study followup requirement Individual previous solid organ transplant Individual celiac plexus block splanchnic nerve block pain relief Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , spinal cord stimulation , acupuncture use medical marijuana pain relief within past 3 month Hospitalization nonpain related condition within past 3 month Surgical treatment ADPKD pain relief past 24 month ( Cyst aspiration , sclerotherapy cyst fenestration surgery ) Individuals significant kidney stone ( &gt; 78 mm ) image study Subjects acute kidney Injury past 6 month Subjects significant renal impairment ( defined glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 determine chronic kidney disease equation Individual participant another interventional clinical trial Subjects additional accessory renal vessel perfuse 25 % kidney Individuals terminal illness expect survival less 1 year Current symptoms cerebral hypoperfusion ( e.g . dizziness lightheadedness , visual blurring darken visual field , syncope ) . Acute coronary syndrome ( standard criterion ) within prior month ( establish biomarkers myocardial anatomy and/or electrocardiogram change Coronary revascularization procedure within 30 day screening , , expect procedure within next 6 month . Valve surgery within 30 day screening , , expect procedure within next 6 month . Cardiac resynchronization therapy , without implantable cardiac defibrillator within 90 day screen expected procedure within next 6 month .
