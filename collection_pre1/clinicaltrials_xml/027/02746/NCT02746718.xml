	<brief_summary>A breach respiratory function may one element less early predominant clinical picture neuromuscular disease . It consider obstructive syndrome represent 64 % restrictive mixed syndrome 36 % chronic respiratory insufficiency , approximately 7 % due neuromuscular disease . The frequency type impairment dependent underlying pathology . The neuromuscular restrictive respiratory failure ( IRR ) remain partially unknown pulmonologists , especially sign muscle weakness sometimes difficult detect . However , respiratory disease major concern neuromuscular disease impact sleep ( sleep , ... ) daily activity ( breathlessness exertion , dyspnea ) thereby alter quality life patient . Moreover , represent significant morbidity mortality factor . Chest tightness may case reveal disease thus constitute chief complaint patient neuromuscular disease . In late-onset Pompe disease , lung disease predominant clinical symptom 30 % patient . An algorithm develop guide practitioner help diagnostic approach cause IRR ( diagnostic algorithm ATS / ERS 2005 ) . However , algorithm allow precise identification neuromuscular cause . At patient level , impact extend time place diagnosis . In Pompe disease , average time diagnosis reach 7.9 year . However , disease simple rapid diagnostic test . Therefore , great awareness practitioner regard particular Pompe disease neuromuscular diseases general may beneficial patient . This study aim : ) awareness pulmonologists possibility neuromuscular IRR . ii ) characterize frequency neuromuscular origin IRR broad population patient concomitant sign muscle weakness . iii ) reduce time diagnosis direct patient neuromuscular reference center early .</brief_summary>
