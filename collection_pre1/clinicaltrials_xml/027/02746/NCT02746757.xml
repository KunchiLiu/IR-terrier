	<brief_title>Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Remote Ischemic Conditioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism behind cardioprotective effect remote precondition incompletely understood . Data experimental study suggest combination humoral neurogenic factor mediate transition protective signal peripheral tissue myocardium . A major break-through understand signal observation vagal nerve activation involve . Key signal pathway target organ likely mediate via vascular endothelium know play important role early reperfusion period . Thus , animal study demonstrate RIPC stimulate endothelial nitric oxide production secondary down-regulation arginase . It remain unclear , however , whether RIPC via activation endothelial nitric oxide preserve endothelial function human . Additional data indicate strongly glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) provide protection ischemia-reperfusion injury experimental animal model well clinical study . The role GLP-1 protective effect RIPC previously investigate , however . The present study therefore design determine involvement GLP-1 protection induce RIPC via endothelial activation human . To end use model reversible ischemia-reperfusion injury forearm , GLP-1 antagonist exendin 9-39 ( Ex 9-39 ) . Objective To test hypothesis GLP-1 mediator protection endothelial function induce RIPC ischemia-reperfusion . Endpoints Primary : Change endothelium dependent vasodilatation induce RIPC Secondary : Change plasma GLP-1 Study subject The study perform healthy volunteer 18-60 year age . All subject undergo screen include medical history routine clinical examination , free medication . A screening blood sample include hemoglobin , leukocyte platelet count , fast blood glucose , HbA1c , total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , triglyceride . Methods Endothelial function determine brachial artery flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) . Briefly , non-invasive examination radial artery non-dominant arm perform 11 MHz ( output 12 MHz ) linear-array transducer connect Vivid E9 . The transducer connect flexible tripod prevent movement probe . Images record save every third second end-diastole . Baseline radial artery diameter record one minute define mean 20 image . A blood pressure cuff place around upper part forearm , inflate 30 mmHg systolic pressure 200 mmHg 5 min . The diameter radial artery continuously record 3 min hyperemia follow deflation cuff . The three frame display maximum dilatation end-diastole ( triggered ECG ) use calculate mean diameter . All image analyze Brachial analyzer ( Medical Imaging Applications , Iowa City , IA , USA ) . FMD calculate percentage increase diameter baseline diameter accord follow formula : diameter follow cuff deflation-baseline diameter/baseline diameter x 100 . All evaluation perform blind . A decrease endothelial function establish outcome reperfusion injury . Study protocol After determine basal FMD ischemia induce inflate cuff 200 mmHg upper arm 20 min follow reperfusion . FMD determine 20 min start reperfusion . Each individual examine three occasion : A ) ischemia-reperfusion without intervention , B ) ischemia-reperfusion intervention RIPC , C ) ischemia-reperfusion RIPC administration Ex 9-39 . The order examination randomly assign draw one three number . RIPC perform cycle 5 min inflation ( 200 mmHg 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure ) 5 min deflation automatic blood pressure cuff around leave thigh . Two cycle perform ischemia 2 cycle immediately reperfusion . The GLP-1 receptor antagonist Ex 9-39 administer bolus 7500 pmol/kg follow iv infusion start 15 min initial FMD maintain second FMD rate 500 pmol/kg/min . The dose base previous experience study human . During experimental protocol follow blood sample collect analysis glucose , insulin , GLP-1 .</detailed_description>
