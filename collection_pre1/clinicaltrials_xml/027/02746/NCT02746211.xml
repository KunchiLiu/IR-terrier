	<brief_title>Influenza Challenge Study Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim determine infectious titre Influenza A ( H1N1 ) ( A/New Caledonia/20/99 ) virus use Influenza challenge study development Influenza vaccine , antiviral agent well understand host response Influenza infection . In addition , safety inoculum , virus shed nasal mucosa follow challenge Influenza. , change mRNA protein expression blood nasal brush sample . assess Self report symptom follow challenge record . Samples take facilitate validation CMI immunologically relevant assay development Overall Trial Design : For group subject , quarantine , challenge phase , release quarantine decontamination occur concurrently designate study site throughout challenge phase study . The volunteer stratify four group depend intended challenge titre virus : High titre Medium-high titre Medium-low titre Low titre Influenza inoculation ( nasal drop )</detailed_description>
