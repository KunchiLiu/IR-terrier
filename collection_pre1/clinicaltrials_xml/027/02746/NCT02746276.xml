	<brief_summary>Children severe malnutrition admit sick hospital high mortality , usually infection . All child severe malnutrition admit hospital treat antibiotic . However , policymakers sure current antibiotic effective . It possible antibiotic currently use second-line use first . Finding need large trial compare different antibiotic . To prepare trial investigator first want make sure dos give correct malnourished child . The investigator also want check whether malnourished child commonly carry resistant bacteria feces well-nourished child . The study important type antibiotic dos need fight infection may different malnourish child change body due malnutrition type bacteria present .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children complicate severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) admit hospital sub-Saharan Africa inpatient case fatality 10 20 % . Because child SAM may exhibit usual sign infection , World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline recommend routine antibiotic . However base `` low quality evidence '' . There evidence Centre Geographic Medical Research - Coast ( CGMR-C ) , Kilifi centre Africa bacterial resistance currently recommend first-line antibiotic ( gentamicin plus ampicillin penicillin ) may problem . It possible frequent illness antibiotic exposure , malnourish child may likely resistant bacteria . Some hospital Africa already increase use ceftriaxone first-line treatment . However , base data ceftriaxone actually improve outcome . Of concern ceftriaxone use may also lead problem antimicrobial resistance , include induce extended spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) class resistance . A area evidence policy lack use metronidazole severely malnourish child . The WHO guideline recommend `` Metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg every 8 h 7 day may give addition broad-spectrum antibiotic ; however , efficacy treatment establish clinical trial . '' Metronidazole effective Giardia , common amongst child SAM ; anaerobic infection , include small bowel bacterial overgrowth Clostridium difficile colitis . Small cohort study suggest may benefit nutritional recovery . In Jamaica , half child admit nutritional rehabilitation evidence small bowel anaerobic bacterial overgrowth improve metronidazole . However , metronidazole cause nausea anorexia , potentially impairing recovery malnutrition may also cause liver neurological toxicity . One small study metronidazole child SAM conduct Mexico report significantly prolonged clearance SAM , without symptomatic toxicity , suggest dose frequency reduction . Overall , pharmacokinetic study do malnourished child . Changes body composition well metabolic drug elimination mechanism may alter potential toxicity effective dose . The investigator plan large clinical trial ass efficacy ceftriaxone metronidazole mortality , nutritional recovery antimicrobial resistance sick , severely malnourished child . This preparatory work aim determine pharmacokinetics ceftriaxone metronidazole 80 severely malnourished child admit three hospital Kenya order ensure dose main trial safe therapeutic range . The study also determine frequency faecal carriage antimicrobial resistant enteric bacteria presentation hospital discharge follow exposure antibiotic hospital environment , compare 360 child , 360 child without severe malnutrition three different hospital . Clear data benefit , risk pharmacokinetics antimicrobial influence policy case management antimicrobial stewardship vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
