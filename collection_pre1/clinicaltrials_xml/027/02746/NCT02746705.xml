	<brief_summary>This study test tolerability preliminary efficacy transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) combine cognitive training program , remotely-delivered use telemedicine protocol 60 adult multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The study evaluate efficacy tDCS evaluate two debilitating symptom MS : cognitive impairment fatigue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>National Multiple Sclerosis Society ( NMSS ) Pilot Study Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) demonstrate : 1. successfully treat fatigue adult MS , 2. improve learning ability aspect cognitive function healthy control participant range medical disorder . Cognitive impairment MS remain major treatment challenge trial tDCS combine cognitive training program treat MS-related cognitive impairment warrant . However , one barrier study tDCS need participant travel study site tDCS administration . To address issue , biomedical company Soterix , recently design remote-delivery tDCS device design use clinical trial . Therefore , primary goal study establish protocol remotely-supervised in-home tDCS delivery study MS participant . Established safety feasibility remotely-supervised tDCS delivery facilitate next step large control trial , MS well condition , determine efficacy appropriate real-world use .</detailed_description>
