	<brief_summary>Background : Commonly , patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) present dyspnea , dynamic hyperinflation ( DH ) important peripheral muscle deoxygenation perform activity daily live ( ADLs ) . The slow chest compression ( SCC ) technique physiotherapy strategy could maybe reduce DH , dyspnea peripheral muscle deoxygenation patient COPD . The aim study analyse effect SCC DH , dyspnea peripheral muscle deoxygenation induce exercise test . Design : Randomized cross-over study . Setting : The study conduct outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program Florianopolis , Brazil Subjects : Patients COPD ( GOLD B-D ) . Interventions : Patients randomly receive SCC six-minute step test ( 6MST-SCC 6MST-NonSCC ) six minute walk test ( 6MWT-SCC 6MWT-NonSCC ) Main measure : At baseline 1 minute test , inspiratory capacity ( IC ) assess slow vital capacity ( SVC ) maneuver . At baseline , immediately , 1 minute test , dyspnea score assess . The physiological response peripheral muscle deoxygenation assess test 1 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary function test : - Lung function test use total body plethysmography ( Eric Jaeger , Germany ) , calibration check evaluation . Spirometry perform accordance American Thoracic Society European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS ) standard ( Miller et al. , 2005 ; Wanger et al. , 2005 ) . The predicted value calculate equation derive Brazilian population ( Pereira et al. , 2007 ; Neder et al. , 1999 ) . - SVC maneuver : IC measure patient sit position , use portable spirometer ( NDD Medical Technologies® , Switzerland ) , 1 minute test , SVC maneuver start stable end-expiratory volume , accordance ATS/ERS standard ( Miller et al.,2005 ) . A minimum three maneuver ( maximum eight ) perform , order consider reliable , two curve could vary 5 % 150 ml . The high value two reproducible curve use analysis ( O'Donnell et al. , 2001 ) . This outcome collect third evaluator blind SCC non-SCC application . Six-minute step test ( 6MST ) : The patient instruct walk step order perform large number step six minute . The walk speed select patient ( da Costa et al. , 2014 ; . Pessoa et al. , 2014 ) . Two 6MSTs conduct two evaluator : main evaluator responsible conducting test count number step perform patient . Six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) : The patient instruct walk order perform large distance six minute . The walk speed select patient , accord guideline American Thoracic Society ( 2014 ) . Two 6MWTs conduct two evaluator : main evaluator responsible conducting test count distance perform patient . Dyspnea : Before completion 6MST 6MWT , patient ask perception dyspnea , use modify Borg scale . Immediately completion SCC ( ) , patient ask dyspnea score . This outcome collect third evaluator blind SCC non-SCC application . Peripheral muscle oxygenation : During test , completion 6MST 6MWT , measure peripheral muscle oxygenation near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) ( Artinis Medical Systems® , Netherlands ) . The device position vastus lateralis muscle dominant leg . Slow chest compression : The patient receive randomize order application SCC one minute immediately 6MST 6MWT . During SCC , patient remain sitting position ; bimanual slow compression his/her upper chest perform always evaluator , stand behind patient . This compression do expiratory phase , one minute , respiratory cycle , respect chest mobility patient . For patient , SCC , give standardize verbal command : `` Exhale air '' . After test patient receive SCC , he/she must remain seated , rest , one minute without intervention , although give standardized verbal command .</detailed_description>
