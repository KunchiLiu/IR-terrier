	<brief_title>Cancer Associated Thrombosis , Pilot Treatment Study Using Rivaroxaban</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients active cancer symptomatic pulmonary embolism , proximal deep vein thrombosis , iliac caval thrombosis randomly assign receive either dalteparin use CLOT regimen oral rivaroxaban use conventional dosage give Einstein study . Experimental control treatment give three month . The main outcome three month include symptomatic incidentally discover venous thromboembolic event include pulmonary embolism ( either objectively confirm death due pulmonary embolism ) , low limb upper limb deep vein thrombosis , iliac , caval visceral thrombosis worsen vascular obstruction collect systematically inclusion day 90 . The safety end-points consist rate major bleeding composite major non-major clinically significant bleeding day 90 . All outcome event blindly adjudicate central independent adjudication committee .</detailed_description>
