These promising , modifiable lifestyle intervention potential delay disease onset slow decline cognition . However , therapeutic effect lifestyle intervention patient mild cognitive impairment , prime intervention period treatment , well understood . Therefore , study , investigator examine brain , body , cognitive change older adult engage moderate-aerobic walking healthy living education .</detailed_description>
