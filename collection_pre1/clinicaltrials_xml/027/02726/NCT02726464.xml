	<detailed_description>An observational study evaluate characteristic Platelet Rich Plasma use therapy treatment musculoskeletal degenerative joint condition . Patients enrol study already assess Principal Investigator schedule receive treatment Platelet Rich Plasma . Prior treatment patient ask consent study composition PRP evaluate . Consenting patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion complete pain score self-assessment prior treatment . An autologous preparation PRP sample make subject 's whole blood . The subject receive PRP treatment excess portion PRP preparation test composition relative concentration constituent . The sample PRP test use Dynamic Light Scattering ( ThromboLUX System ) measure constituent PRP preparation prior injection . PRP whole blood ( physician 's discretion ) analyze hematology analyzer . The test work-flow alter subject 's standard care . The physician blind analytical result enrolment , treatment patient follow-up phase study . Analytical result use patient management decision . Patient 's response PRP treatment assess 3 6 week post injection . At time , clinical outcome treatment measure use patient self -assessment ( post-treatment pain score ) . This study test hypothesis PRP characteristic , platelet microparticle content composition predictive clinical outcome PRP treatment . The clinical outcome evaluate patient pre- post-pain score assessment . This study aim review clinical outcome compare result ThromboLUX test result . If predictive value platelet composition test demonstrate , additional study may consider .</detailed_description>
