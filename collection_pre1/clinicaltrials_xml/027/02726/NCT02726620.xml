	<brief_title>Decision Support Intraoperative Low Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood pressure management important part anesthesia . Many factor contribute change blood pressure surgical procedure , blood loss , manipulation surgeon , several mechanism anesthesia change blood pressure . Although high blood pressure also occur anesthesia , factor lower patient 's blood pressure . When patient 's blood pressure become low , internal organ become risk receive enough blood ( low perfusion hypoperfusion ) . This low perfusion state result organ damage ( ischemia ) insufficient supply oxygen glucose . Hence important task anesthesia provider maintain blood pressure patient , use wide range drug intervention . A big challenge blood pressure management know low blood pressure indeed result low perfusion organ . There large variation patient susceptible low blood pressure , well difference organ easily damage low perfusion . Elder patient , patient preexist hypertension , heart problem cardiovascular disease prone low blood pressure likely develop organ ischemia low blood pressure . The kidney , heart brain organ risk organ damage . As one measure perfusion state individual organ individual patient , difficult know 'how low go ' patient 's blood pressure . Recent study use large datasets patient demonstrate statistical association low blood pressure surgery various type organ injury . As patient already treat low blood pressure anesthesia provider , suggest patient low organ perfusion state despite current treatment standard . A patient 's blood pressure simply dial adjust specific level . Finding right level intervention difficult patient . Consequently , low blood pressure common anesthesia , even current standard blood pressure management . In proposed study investigator implement two form decision support assist anesthesia provider blood pressure management . The decision support aim educate anesthesia provider risk low blood pressure direct relation patient treat . One form decision support provide automate notification pager anesthesia information management system . These automated notification pop patient 's blood pressure drop level associate risk organ injury , thus alert anesthesia provider blood pressure associate risk . The second form decision support send postoperative email day procedure patient low blood pressure particular duration . This email provide feedback anesthesia provider inform increased risk organ injury associate low blood pressure . The study look change patient outcome change blood pressure management perform two center : Vanderbilt University Medical Center ( VUMC ) University Medical Center Utrecht , Netherlands ( UMCU ) . Each center independently execute study use study protocol , however , different primary end point . The change patient outcome primarily study occurrence acute kidney injury first day follow procedure VUMC occurrence myocardial injury follow procedure UMCU . The change blood pressure management ( provider behavior ) study observe depth duration low pressure anesthesia , number intervention use treat blood pressure . Patient outcome study comparison baseline phase - decision support implement us historic data- intervention phase - period intervention active . Only routinely collect clinical data use analysis : additional data collection require . As center independently execute study , need share protect health information center . The result two center combine use completely deidentified data . As impossible know form decision support effective , first three month intervention period 'nested cluster-randomized trial ' . The anesthesia provider ( patient ) randomize either automated notification feedback email . After three month anesthesia provider receive form decision support remainder intervention period . The reason anesthesia provider randomize first three month cross-over contamination two group expect . This contamination could make impossible study effect decision support patient outcome , long difference study group .</detailed_description>
