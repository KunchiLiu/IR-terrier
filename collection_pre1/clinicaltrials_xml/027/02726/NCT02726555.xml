	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety Combined Therapy With Red Yeast Rice Low-dose Statinï¼šComparing With Standardized Statin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both Red Yeast Rice Statins cholesterol-lowering medication often prescribe secondary prevention cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The investigator ' previous pilot study ( NCT01686451 ) suggest red yeast rice similar lipid-lowering efficacy associate less fatigue statin . The aim study compare efficacy safety combine therapy red yeast rice 1.2 g/day atorvastatin 10 mg/day atorvastatin 20 mg/day person mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease qualify statin therapy accord national guideline . This study enroll individual establish mild atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease currently take lipid-lowering medication . Participants randomly assign receive combine therapy red yeast rice 1.2 g/day atorvastatin 10 mg/day atorvastatin 20 mg/day 24 week . Study visit occur screen , baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 16 , week 24 . Blood collect laboratory testing , standardized questionnaire ass noncardiovascular endpoint . Pill count use assess adherence treatment . Medication side effect monitor test alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransaminase ( AST ) creatine phosphate kinase ( CPK ) perform . Medication efficacy assess test low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) perform .</detailed_description>
