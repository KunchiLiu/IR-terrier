	<brief_title>Clobazam Adjunctive Treatment Adults With Refractory Focal Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 35 % patient epilepsy respond treatment medication . There need new treatment refractory focal epilepsy . Clobazam approve 2011 US treatment refractory seizures patient Lennox Gastaut syndrome ( LGS ) . Patients LGS different seizure type . While pivotal study evaluate primary generalized seizure , LGS patient also focal seizure . The goal present study obtain pilot data efficacy safety clobazam add-on treatment adult drug-resistant focal epilepsy . This open label study compare seizure frequency 12 week baseline observation period seizure frequency 16 week clobazam adjunctive treatment . 10 adult age 18-65 focal seizure fail respond ≥ 4 antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) +/- respective surgery enrol . Following baseline 12 week , patient start clobazam , administer orally b.i.d . schedule . In patient seizure diary keep prospectively prior study screen visit , retrospective baseline accept . Patients titrate either seizure freedom , side effect 40 mg/day , whichever come first . Titration rate force . It anticipate majority subject 4 week-long titration period . After maximum dose achieve , maintenance treatment last 12 week . Primary efficacy outcome measure seizure freedom 3 month maintenance treatment high tolerate clobazam dose . Secondary outcome measure include &gt; 75 % seizure frequency reduction median seizure frequency reduction whole treatment duration maintenance treatment period , compare seizure frequency per 28 day period treatment vs. baseline . Primary safety outcome measure include treatment emergent adverse event , treatment discontinuation due treatment emergent adverse event . The number subject small , n=10 . It therefore likely result obtain present study statistically significant . The goal present study ascertain whether clobazam add-on treatment adult refractory focal epilepsy give signal efficacy great demonstrated second third generation anticonvulsant levetiracetam , pregabalin , lacosamide perampanel ; specifically whether clobazam adjunctive treatment show trend towards 75 % response seizure freedom rate surpasses see phase 3 levetiracetam , pregabalin , lacosamide perampanel study . The result , positive , use design large control study would follow .</detailed_description>
