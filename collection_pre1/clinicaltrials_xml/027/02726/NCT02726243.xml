	<brief_title>Intestinal Microbiota Colorectal Cancer Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic relapse disable disease . Crohn 's disease ( CD ) Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) two main type IBD . Patients IBD great risk intestinal infection include viral infection ( include cytomegalovirus ) bacterial ( especially Clostridium difficile ) . In long term , patient colonic involvement increase risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Moreover , report several cohort study patient primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) associate IBD ( PSC-IBD ) , even increase risk CRC ( 10 20 % 10 year ) . Other study also suggest microbiota impact liver disease . Conversely , cholestatic liver disease ( PSC ) influence microbiota , notably modification production bile acid . Finally , role gut microbiota development CRC IBD well establish animal model . The pathophysiological mechanism well understood may involve alteration balance protective bacteria harmful microbiota . This study aim investigate link gut microbiota , intestinal inflammation , colorectal cancer , bile acid liver disease , creation biological collection fecal microbiota fecal sample 8 group subject : ( ) IBD without CCR ( ii ) IBD CCR , ( iii ) IBD dysplasia , ( iv ) non IBD without CCR , ( v ) non IBD CCR , ( vi ) IBD-CSP without CCR , ( vii ) IBD-CSP CCR , ( viii ) IBD-CSP dysplasia . In patient , microbiota composition assess sequence technology .</detailed_description>
