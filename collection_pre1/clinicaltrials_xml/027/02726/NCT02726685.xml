	<brief_title>Effects Respiratory Training Respiratory Functional Performance Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke rank third global cause death , behind cancer coronary heart disease . Stroke also third large cause death Taiwan 2014 . Stroke patient course exercise addition muscle weakness reduce endurance , usually also accompanied respiratory damage . From past study show stroke patient whose respiratory function significant change , decrease respiratory muscle strength , reduce respiratory movement affect hemithorax , decline maximum breathing pressure decrease amplitude diaphragmatic movement paralyzed side . But whether respiratory train improve respiratory functional performance stroke patient , limited research result could confirm .</detailed_description>
