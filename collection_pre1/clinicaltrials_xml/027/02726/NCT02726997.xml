	<brief_title>Matched Paired Pharmacodynamics Feasibility Study Durvalumab Combination With Chemotherapy Frontline Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : This study 2 part : safety lead-in Phase 2 . If find eligible take part study , assign either Safety Lead-in Phase 2 portion , depend join study . Up 12 participant enrol Safety Lead-in , 24 participant enrol Phase 2 . If enrol Safety Lead-in , dose durvalumab receive depend join study . The first 4 participant receive first dose level durvalumab enrol one time , every 3 week . Each new participant group 6 participant enrol receive either dose previous participant group lower dose either durvalumab chemotherapy . This continue tolerable appropriate dose durvalumab chemotherapy find . If enrolled Phase 2 , receive durvalumab high dose tolerate Safety Lead-in . Study Drug Administration : For participant , study drug give 2 step call Primary Therapy Maintenance . In Primary Therapy part study , cycle 21 day . You receive study drug schedule 3 cycle 3 cycle plan surgery ( 6 cycle total ) . - You receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycles 1-6 . - You receive carboplatin vein 1 hour Day 1 Cycles 1-6 . - You receive durvalumab vein 1 hour every 2 week Cycles 1-6 . After , may begin Maintenance Phase . In phase , cycle 28 day long . You receive durvalumab alone every 2 week 7 cycle ( 28 week ) . It continue give vein 1 hour . Study Visits Primary Therapy : At Week 1 Cycles 1-6 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . In Cycles 1-3 , blood also use biomarker test . The biomarker test study may include genetic biomarkers . Biomarkers find blood tissue may relate reaction study drug . - You EKG check heart function ( Cycles 1 6 ) . In Cycle 1 , EKG perform within 1 hour start study drug infusion least 1 time 3 hour end infusion . At Weeks 2 3 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Weeks 2 3 Cycles 2-6 , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . After Cycle 3 , temporarily stop receive study drug prepare surgery . At visit surgery : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . - You EKG check heart function . - You MRI CT scan check status disease . You sign separate consent form surgery explain procedure risk . During surgery , tumor tissue collect biomarker genetic testing . All sample store MD Anderson unlimited amount time test relate study . At visit surgery : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At visit part study except day surgery visit surgery , complete 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 study questionnaire . You tell many complete time . When complete 1 questionnaire several visit , take 10-15 minute . Anytime doctor think need : - If become pregnant , part routine blood sample used pregnancy test . - Part routine blood sample use blood clotting test . Study Visits During Maintenance Therapy : At Week 1 Cycles 7-13 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker test . - You EKG check heart function . - You complete 6 study questionnaire . At Week 3 Cycles 7-13 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Every 12 week , MRI CT scan check status disease . At every visit Cycles 7-12 Weeks 1 4 Cycle 13 , complete 1 , 6 , 7 study questionnaire . You tell many complete time . Anytime doctor think need : - If become pregnant , part routine blood sample used pregnancy test . - Part routine blood sample use blood clotting test . Interviews : You 2 interview study staff : receive treatment complete least 2 cycle treatment tumor reduction surgery begin receive maintenance therapy durvalumab alone . Each interview may take 25-45 minute . During interview , ask question symptom time diagnose , symptom currently , symptom receive previous treatment cancer . During second interview , ask symptom change since first interview . The interview hold private conference room digitally record . The study staff transcribe ( create text copy ) interview record name , medical record number , identify information . The electronic file transcription interview store securely . Length Treatment : You may receive 6 cycle study drug combination 7 cycle durvalumab alone . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visi : After last study drug dose : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . - You MRI CT scan check status disease . - You EKG check heart function . - You complete 6 questionnaire . Follow-up : At 30 day last durvalumab dose : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect routine test . If become pregnant , part sample use pregnancy test . - You complete 6 questionnaire . At Month 2 last durvalumab dose , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At Month 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At Months 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , ask . This may also do Month 9 , depend long take durvalumab reason stop . The study staff tell 9-month visit . At Month 12 every 6 month , depend long take durvalumab reason stop , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) may draw routine test . As often doctor think need , MRI CT scan check status disease . This depend long take durvalumab reason stop . If choose return follow-up visit , instead receive follow-up phone call Months 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 last durvalumab dose every 2 month start Month 12 . You ask . The call take 10-15 minute . This investigational study . Durvalumab FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Paclitaxel carboplatin FDA approve commercially available . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
