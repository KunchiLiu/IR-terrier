	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn regulation vein abdomen autonomic ( involuntary ) nervous system , may affect high blood pressure . Normally , autonomic nervous system control much blood flow vein . In people high blood pressure , however , autonomic nervous system change . This change may affect way blood flow vein abdomen may play role high blood pressure . About 32 participant screen study . The investigator estimate 16 eligible participate study day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction Splanchnic Capacitance Contributes Sympathetically Dependent Hypertension Autonomic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator study male female subject , age 40-80 year possible probable Multiple System Atrophy , define Consensus Criteria suffer supine hypertension define SBP≥150 , neurogenic orthostatic hypotension , define ≥30-mmHg decrease systolic BP within 3 minute stand associate impaired autonomic reflex determine autonomic test absence identifiable cause . All participant able willing provide inform consent . Screening Procedures . Potential participant study Vanderbilt Autonomic Dysfunction Center ( ADC ) . Medications affect BP , blood volume autonomic nervous system antihypertensive , pressor medication fludrocortisone withdraw least 5 half-lives study . Screening procedure perform one day depend patient 's investigator 's availability . - Patients undergo complete history physical examination , ECG , routine clinical laboratory analysis blood pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . - Autonomic test include sinus arrhythmia , Valsalva maneuver posture study plasma catecholamine perform determine meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . During test , blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate ( HR ) obtain use automate oscillometric sphygmomanometer , finger photoplethysmography , continuous ECG . During orthostatic test , blood sample obtain hormone regulate BP , catecholamine , patient supine upright . Medical history information result screen procedure obtain within previous 6 month study within research group may utilize . Study Procedures : Study Day 1 2 Eligible Multiple System Atrophy patient supine hypertension study twice randomize , single blind , crossover design , trimethaphan placebo . The order administration randomize . The placebo day identical intervention , saline infuse instead trimethaphan provide time control . Studies conduct postvoid state ≥2 hour meal . Each study day last 2-3 hour . The following procedure conduct : Patients instrumented measure blood pressure continuously photoplethysmography , intermittently automate oscillometric device . Heart rate monitor continuously ECG . Electrodes place thorax abdomen measure segmental impedance . Skin blood flow measure forearm laser Doppler . Cardiac output measure inert gas rebreathing technique and/or impedance cardiography . An IV place one arm drug administration . After instrumentation baseline measurement record , include cardiac output splanchnic venous capacitance . Venous capacitance estimate use adaptation method Schmitt et al . In technique , segmental impedance monitor , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) apply sequentially 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 16 cm water ( H20 ) 1-2 minute . Patients receive either placebo ( time control ) trimethaphan , induce complete withdrawal residual sympathetic tone . Intravenous infusion trimethaphan camsylate ( Cambridge Labs ) start 0.5-1 mg/min increase 1.0 mg/min 2-6 minute interval one follow endpoint : presyncopal symptom , decrease blood pressure increase infusion rate , infusion rate 4 mg/min . Once stable decrease blood pressure obtain , outcome measurement repeat . Abdominal compression apply sustained 40 mm Hg pressure supine inflatable binder . Outcome measurement repeat 5-15 minute later . The investigator may decide perform procedure ( due longer anticipated study day duration / drug infusion ) . In case , study include outcome measurement drug infusion . The infusion trimethaphan stop patient monitor blood pressure restore baseline value .</detailed_description>
