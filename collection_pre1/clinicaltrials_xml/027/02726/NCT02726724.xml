	<brief_summary>The Endotracheal intubation ( ETI ) neonate procedure usually attract large number observer . The fear judge others could cause increase level stress , especially junior trainee . Little research focus effect audience level stress therefore , success rate complicate procedure neonatal intensive care . Hypothesis : Investigators hypothesize time successful intubation ( second ) long presence observer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Presence Observers Influence Success Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The aim study provide objective evidence support junior trainee less successful neonatal ETI presence large audience . If hypothesis correct , data provide evidence support resident request less people around procedure , may increase chance successful intubation . After Investigators obtain write consent - select student-will ask wear cardiac monitor 5 minute later period rest , call delivery room . Two minute arrival give stylet 3.5 ET tube ask intubate orally mannequin , 30 second , operator remind time . After 45 second attempt stop . Participants inform right discontinue participation time . The trainee informed end experience aim study ask keep confidential . The trainee randomize two group differentiate condition start intubation . Condition A : Only staff present operator Condition B : An audience 5 people least 2 neonatologists present case junior resident responsible stage case respiratory therapy student . The resident perform intubation condition A repeat intubation 24 hour later use condition B vice versa . The time local 2 procedure condition . Time successful intubation compare two experimental condition subject pair test . A p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . To estimate require sample size , Investigators use study O'Donnel al give approximate intubation time trainees 38 second standard deviation 20 second ( 14 ) . Using alpha threshold 0.05 power 80 % , sample size 51 subject require detect 8 second difference time two different group . Eight second represent 25 % change time intubate clinically significant newborn .</detailed_description>
