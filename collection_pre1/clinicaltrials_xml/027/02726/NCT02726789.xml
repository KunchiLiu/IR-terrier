	<brief_title>Combination Treatment With REP 2139-Ca Pegasys Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B long term condition cause infection body hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . This infection often result inflammation scar liver eventually lead liver cirrhosis liver failure . These infection also one major cause development hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) . Although drug approve treat chronic hepatitis B infection , provide complete cure except rare case ( cure generally mean person lose hepatitis B virus blood liver develop durable immunological control subsequent HBV infection ) . However , drug significantly decrease risk liver damage liver cancer arise presence chronic liver infection slow stop production infectious virus . Thus primary problem associate currently available drug lack clearance virus hepatocytes necessitates long term treatment drug . There clearly need identify new drug benefit patient chronic hepatitis B infection . Nucleic acid-based polymer ( NAPs ) new class broad-spectrum antiviral compound act HBV infection block release surface antigen protein ( HBsAg ) infect hepatocytes . Current interim data analysis REP 102 assess activity NAP REP 9AC ' ( REP 2139 , give calcium chelate complex [ REP 2139-Ca ] ) patient chronic HBV infection indicate follow : 1 . REP 2139-Ca generally well tolerated patient tolerate short term combine treatment ( 13-26 week ) pegylated interferon / thymosin alpha 2 . REP 2139-Ca achieve serum HBsAg reduction clearance 9 9 patient receive combined therapy . 3 . Appearance substantial titer serum anti-HBs occur addition immunotherapy . 4 . After treatment withdrawn , 8 / 9 patient achieve HBV DNA &lt; 116 copy / ml ( LLOQ Roche Cobas platform ) sustain suppression viremia ( HBV DNA &lt; 1000 cpm , HBsAg &lt; 1 IU / ml ) period great 1 year observe four patient . This exploratory study design examine REP 2139-Ca safely combine full course pegylated interferon treatment naive patient patient previous continue therapy entecavir similar antiviral effect observe previous REP 101 102 protocol .</detailed_description>
