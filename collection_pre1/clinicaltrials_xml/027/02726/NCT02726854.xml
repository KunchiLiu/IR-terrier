	<brief_summary>The main research purpose Evaluation objective response Apatinib second-line treatment advance pancreatic cancer ( ORR ) rate progression free survival ( PFS ) . Objective study objective exploratory secondary research To observe Apatinib second line treatment advance pancreatic cancer disease control rate ( DCR ) , patient overall survival ( OS ) benefit , treatment effect quality life ( QOL ) score drug safety evaluation , To investigate relationship apatinib second-line treatment advance pancreatic cancer expression vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) serum</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine effect apatinib advance pancreatic cancer patient failure first-line chemotherapy tolerate second-line chemotherapy unwilling receive second-line chemotherapy pancreatic cancer patients.To investigate relationship apatinib second-line treatment advance pancreatic cancer expression vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) serum . This study choose First Affiliated Hospital Xi'an JiaoTong University unable tolerate failure first-line chemotherapy second-line chemotherapy unwilling receive second-line chemotherapy pancreatic cancer patient research object , clinical data clinical subject age sex , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group （ECOG） score , tumor stage , pathological type , pathological grading , give apatinib treatment , treatment blood monitoring patient CA199 level , image finding , assessment tumor relate symptom adverse event , expression VEGFR blood measure ELISA method , curative effect evaluation end 2 cycle treatment , patient effective evaluation oral apatinib , statistical analysis data complete remission ( CR ) partial remission ( PR ) , rate progression free survival ( PFS ) expression CA199 content serum serum VEGFR level relevant indicator , . Explore Apatinib curative effect safety second-line treatment advance pancreatic cancer , explore relationship serum VEGF expression level .</detailed_description>
