	<detailed_description>Background : Magnetic resonance imaging ( `` MRI '' ) integral part medical diagnostics since 20 year . Using MRI soft tissue image body region brain , abdominal musculoskeletal , possible clearly superior image technique . Due complex physical condition typical MRI scan take 30-90 minute ( patient movement ) , generate noise level 75-100 decibel require placement patient often cramp perceive tube scanner . These adverse condition know significantly negative impact patient 's comfort , also change image quality thus reduce diagnostic accuracy investigation . Motivation : At University Hospital Zurich ( USZ ) total 10 , partly different MR scanner , available clinical imaging . These device differ manufacturer different design premise , equipment , coil table size , log generate examination volume room temperature . For example , one exist examination room USZ equip manufacturer costly patient comfort package . This room serve showroom positive example maximum patient comfort . Our experience show , overall , MRI scan unit result image quality fluctuate greatly Patient Feedback individual study partly quite negative . Improved study condition therefore accessible term patient comfort improve diagnostic accuracy , goal . Current status research : The work group `` Research Musculoskeletal Radiology '' Institute Diagnostic Interventional Radiology University Hospital Zurich lead PhD Dr. med . Gustav Andreisek authority already carry successfully numerous project field magnetic resonance imaging . Objectives : The aim prospective monocentric study evaluate patient comfort MRI measure examination condition factor may affect image quality thus diagnostic accuracy . For purpose total 1000 participant enrol study , consist healthy volunteer ( N = 300 ) well patient ( N = 700 ) , assign clinically indicate MRI scan . In study , individual region body study MRI ( example , knee , ankle , head spine ) . For participant study , investigation region examine exactly except single external factor change different . Such variable factor may include : tube diameter magnet , weight coil , closely attach examined area body , height adjustment table participant lie , duration study protocol generate volume investigation . Participants involuntarily subject particular MRI scanner set availability USZ Radiology disposition . For evaluation data , participant match term body region examine base part patient subject group . Due fine different experimental condition , influence factor study patient comfort , well image quality thus diagnostic accuracy investigate . By approach , relevant factor examine isolation . Only explore patient 's perception/comfort MRI scan , patient-orientated design study condition improve thus possibility modern MRI technology fully utilized clinical practice .</detailed_description>
