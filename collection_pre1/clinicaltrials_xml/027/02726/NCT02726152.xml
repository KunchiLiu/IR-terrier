	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study compare two method close stump appendix emergency excision appendix use keyhole approach . One similarly design study undertaken another institution enough patient recruit study allow meaningful conclusion draw . Any patient age 16 year investigator suspect acute appendicitis consider recruitment study . During exploratory keyhole surgery , surgical team feel excision appendix indicate patient randomly allocate either polymer clip endoloops part procedure stump ( base ) appendix close . The main aim determine polymer clip shorten duration operation . The investigator also determine difference rate complication , time spent hospital number time participant readmitted hospital within 30 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polymer Clips Versus Endoloops Closure Appendiceal Stump During Emergency Laparoscopic Appendicectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose perform randomise control trial within NHS Tayside compare two form appendiceal stump closure emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy . A previous RCT examine topic could well design , small trial population absence power calculation . All patient 16 year old undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy acute appendicitis eligible recruitment trial consent prior theatre . Intra-operatively , decision perform appendicectomy take , participant randomise either application polymer ( Locaclip ) clip endoloops appendiceal stump closure laparoscopic appendicectomy . The primary outcome operative time , secondary outcome include post-operative complication length hospital stay re-admission rate within 30 day . Participants require formal follow-up , either out-patient clinic telephone consultation . Statistical analysis predominantly use Fisher 's exact test determine statistically significant difference intervention arm , whilst group homogeneity analyse important patient parameter . The investigator hypothesise operative time less polymer group compare endoloop group , significant difference see post-operative complication secondary outcomes two cohort . The result RCT add evidence-base use polymer clip appendiceal stump closure potentially support use routine clinical practice . It anticipate take one year recruit participant study 30 day complete follow last participant recruit .</detailed_description>
