	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria stroke population : Radiologically verified unilateral stroke least 4 month previously . Righthanded subject without right hemiparesis ( robot build right arm alone ) . Preserved passive range motion upper limb joint . Spasticity &lt; 3 modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . Ability follow study instruction likely complete protocol ; ability comply protocol assessed investigator ; must English speaking since assessment English . Exclusion Criteria stroke population . History surgery significant injury either upper extremity cause mechanical limitation preclude task performance . Previous neurological illness head trauma , prior stroke ( recruit subject first unilateral stroke ) , epilepsy , demyelinate disease . Complicating medical problem uncontrolled hypertension , diabetes sign polyneuropathy , severe renal , cardiac pulmonary disease , evidence concurrent neurologic orthopedic condition preclude subject comply study protocol . Severe upper extremity spasticity suggest Ashworth score &gt; 3 joint , restriction full passive range motion . Evidence alcohol , drug abuse relevant neuropsychiatric condition psychotic illness severe depression . Inclusion Criteria control population . No previous stroke previous neurological injury . Righthanded subject without weakness hemiparesis ( robot build right arm alone ) . Preserved passive active range motion upper limb joint . No increase muscle tone response passive range motion . A score zero Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . Able achieve full score upper extremity FuglMeyer Scale ( 66/66 ) Ability follow study instruction likely complete protocol ; ability comply protocol assessed investigator ; must English speaking since assessment English . Exclusion Criteria control population . History surgery significant injury either upper extremity cause mechanical limitation preclude task performance . Previous neurological illness head trauma , prior stroke , epilepsy , demyelinate disease . Complicating medical problem uncontrolled hypertension , diabetes sign polyneuropathy , severe renal , cardiac pulmonary disease , evidence concurrent neurologic orthopedic condition preclude subject comply study protocol . Any condition situation , investigator 's opinion , may put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study . Severe upper extremity spasticity suggest Ashworth score &gt; 3 joint , restriction full passive range motion . Evidence alcohol , drug abuse relevant neuropsychiatric condition psychotic illness severe depression .</criteria>
