	<detailed_description>Study design set Cluster randomise control trial involve 80 community ( 40 community Beijing 40 rural village Hebei province ) 2,000 people T2DM . Hypothesis An interactive mobile health management system support lay family health promoter ( FHP ) healthcare staff improve clinical outcome family member T2DM Intervention SMARTHealth Diabetes interactive mobile health platform promote improve self-management people T2DM . It comprise follow core feature : - Management support base best practice clinical guideline - Self-management tool resource family member - Password protect registration patient nominated FHP access information - Population key clinical information desktop application use health care provider applicable Community eligibility - 40 urban community ( Beijing ) 40 rural village ( Hebei ) geographically dispersed region select - Each community/ village must least one community health station provide service ≥1,000 adult resident - Staff community health station must willing participate intervention Statistical power 80 community cluster mean community cluster size 25 participant ( 2,000 total ) provide 90 % power detect absolute improvement 10 % primary outcome . This assume 12 % baseline T2DM prevalence ; 20 % people control arm achieve ≥2 'ABC ' diabetes goal ( ( HbA1C &lt; 7 % ; Blood Pressure &lt; 140/80 mmHg , LDL cholesterol &lt; 100mg/dl 2.6mmol/L ) end study ; intra-class correlation coefficient 0.05 , 20 % loss follow-up , 2-sided significance level 0.05 . This translate mean reduction 0.35 % HbA1C , 0.14 mmol/L LDL cholesterol 3.4mmHg systolic BP . Primary analysis conduct patient level . Secondary analysis conduct cluster level . Sub-group analysis conduct community level ( base size health service characteristic ) patient level ( base demographic factor ( co-habitation FHP ) clinical factor ( control rate 'ABC ' risk factor baseline ) . Significance The Chinese government place prevention treatment diabetes one 11 National Basic Public Health Services . Despite great promise mobile health ( mHealth ) intervention improve access effective health care remain uncertainty successfully achieve . These uncertainty pose substantial dilemma health system planner . The finding likely inform policy scalable strategy overcome sub-optimal access effective health care China .</detailed_description>
