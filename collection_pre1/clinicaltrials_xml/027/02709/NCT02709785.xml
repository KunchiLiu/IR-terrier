	<brief_summary>The aim study provide evidence clinical efficacy SmartMouth Advanced Clinical Formula mouthrinse comparison efficacy 0.12 % chlorhexidine mouthrinse placebo mouthrinse . The placebo provide sponsor identical SmartMouth ACF ( Advanced Clinical Formula ) , except contain cetylpyridinium chloride , zinc chloride sodium chlorite . The primary outcome include measure plaque gingivitis . Secondary outcome include evaluation tooth discoloration , taste perception , malodor calculus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SmartMouth Advanced Clinical Formula Clinical Research Design Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population A 10 week double-blinded , randomized clinical study conduct 85 subject diagnose plaque induce gingivitis and/or chronic periodontitis . The study take place Saint Louis University Center Advanced Dental Education Southern Illinois University School Dental Medicine . Research Design Methods Visit 1 Subjects sign inform consent medical history form meet preliminary entrance criterion examine baseline . All participant inform nature study , purpose , possible risk . Subjects also inform length study specific procedure carry . Subjects inform voluntary study free withdraw study time . Clinical measurement plaque gingival index take . A gingival bleeding score determine . Examiners standardize score . Gingival index ( GI ) measure use Loe Silness method ( Loe Silness 1963 ) . The gingiva score six site tooth ( distobuccal , buccal , mesiobuccal , distolingual , lingual , mesiolingual ) give score 0 - 3 . By add score divide total number site , GI patient obtain . The following criterion use scoring : 0 - Absence inflammation 1 . - Mild inflammation : slight change color , slight edema ; bleed upon probe 2 . - Moderate inflammation : Redness , edema , glaze ; bleed upon probe 3 . - Severe inflammation : Marked redness edema ; ulceration ; tendency spontaneous bleeding Sites GI score 2 3 count bleeding . A whole mouth total gingival bleed score calculate sum number bleed site divide number teeth . Plaque score base Turesky modification Quigley—Hein Plaque Index ( PI ) ( Turesky 1970 ) . A score 0 - 5 assign six site tooth ( distobuccal , buccal , mesiobuccal , distolingual , lingual , mesiolingual ) follow use disclose solution . The following criterion use : 0 - No plaque 1 . - Isolated area plaque gingival margin 2 . - Thin continuous band plaque gingival margin ( 1 mm ) 3 . - Band plaque ˃ 1 mm ˂ 1/3 tooth surface 4 . - Plaque cover 1/3 ˂ 2/3 tooth surface 5 . - Plaque cover ≥ 2/3 tooth surface The Plaque Index entire mouth determine divide total score number surface examine . The Gingival Index measure prior Plaque Index . Teeth gross caries third molar score either index . Extrinsic tooth stain score facial surface 8 incisor teeth use modification Lobene tooth stain index ( SI ) ( Lobene 1968 ) . Each incisor score stain area scale 0-3 . The sum stain score subject use subject 's stain score . Scores record 0 3 follow : 0 : stain detect , tooth color 1. stain 1/3 surface 2. stain 2/3 surface 3. stain 2/3 surface Supragingival calculus lingual surface six mandibular anterior teeth score use Volpe-Manhold calculus index ( CI ) ( Volpe et al . 1965 ) . The supragingival calculus three define plane lingual surface tooth measure use periodontal probe . The measurement add mean subject score calculate . A complete periodontal examination perform subject meet inclusion criterion . A panoramic radiograph take subject full mouth radiograph within last year . Safety assessment make measurement visit . Assessment oral soft tissue conduct visit visual examination oral cavity . All area assess report normal abnormal . Subject compensation : subject enter study give gift card end visit 2 , visit 3 visit 4 . Visit 2 Visit 2 occur within 4 week Visit 1 . Subjects enter study randomly assign three group : Group 1 ( Smart Mouth ACF ) , Group 2 ( 0.12 % chlorhexidine ) Group 3 ( placebo ) . Each group least 25 subject . All subject give complete dental prophylaxis remove plaque , calculus , stain . Written verbal oral hygiene instruction give include regular regimen brush twice daily floss daily . All subject assign commercially available ADA accept toothbrush dental floss . They give 3 week supply assign mouthrinse write verbal instruction use . Subjects instruct teeth professionally clean prior study completion . All mouthrinses plain package dispense faculty investigator . The package label code indicate product . Only faculty investigator access code information . Directions use contain package . The examiner see product . The examiner give instruction mouthrinse use , aware rinse subject use . Each product contain two solution mixed prior use . Visit 3 Subjects examine 3 week visit 2 . All clinical measurement repeat . Each subject return unused rinse two empty bottle rinse . Compliance determine regulate amount rinse dispense 3 week basis measurement unused rinse end two 3 week period . Additional rinse give subject visit 3 use final visit . Visit 4 Subjects examine 3 week visit 3 ( 6 week visit 2 ) . Clinical measurement repeat . Each subject return unused rinse two empty bottle rinse . Compliance determine measurement unused rinse end study . Subjects give survey answer question experience mouthrinse . Prophylaxis may perform visit . Following study , subject treat provider 's discretion .</detailed_description>
