	<brief_summary>Dendritic cell-based cellular vaccine tumor therapy show efficacy . This study design perform personalized clinical trial first analyze expression tumor associate antigens patient newly diagnose glioblastoma immunize patient personalize DC-based cellular vaccine . In addition , allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) use cellular vehicle immunization . Safety efficacy observe study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Cellular Vaccine Glioblastoma ( PERCELLVAC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single-arm , single-institution , Phase I/II study design investigate safety efficacy personalize cellular tumor vaccine patient newly diagnose glioblastoma ( GBM ) . Newly diagnose GBM patient undergo tumor resection . The tumor analyze expression panel glioma-associated antigen immune-related gene . Post surgical treatment 6 week standard chemotherapy temozolomide concurrent radiotherapy continue cycle temozolomide within 28-day window . Patients undergo leukapheresis either surgery concurrent radio/chemotherapy . Based individual tumor antigen expression , vitro transcribe mRNA generate used pulse vitro generate DCs . The patient pre-conditioned DC vaccination either tetanus toxoid vaccine imiquimod cream . Allogeneic PBMCs pulse tumor antigen mRNA . The patient immunize intradermally total twelve time DC PMBC cellular vaccine . Safety efficacy monitor . The primary objective ass safety personalize cellular vaccine . The secondary objective ass specific T cell response immunize vaccine . In addition , antitumor efficacy vaccine measure use iRANO criterion , progression-free survival overall survival .</detailed_description>
