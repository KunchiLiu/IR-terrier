	<brief_summary>This study conduct determine losartan , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , safe effective treatment posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptom . The study also intend determine certain genetic marker useful predict PTSD symptom reduction losartan . Approximately 160 subject chronic PTSD age 18-65 participate study across five site . Subjects assign chance take either flexibly dose losartan ( maximum dosage 100 mg ) placebo ( resembles study drug active ingredient ) , day 10 week . Furthermore , hypothesize CC homozygote rs4311 SNP ACE gene superior response losartan PTSD symptom compare T carrier .</brief_summary>
