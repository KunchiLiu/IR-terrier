	<brief_summary>In patient Crohn 's Disease , symptoms inflammatory back pain ( IBP ) precede change plain X-rays year , MRI change axial inflammation precede development X-ray change . Sacroiliitis MRI without x-ray change ( i.e.Non radiographic SpA ) valid diagnostic criterion Spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) lead early diagnosis SpA patient IBP . It unclear MRI change occur , precede clinical symptom IBP . There report asymptomatic sacroiliitis note MRI Crohn 's patient . This important , MRI evidence inflammation may first sign incipient SpA . Inflammation region axial skeleton SpA patient also document , significance unknown . The prospect undiagnosed untreated inflammation concerning , lead significant morbidity . Moreover , relationship MRI evidence axial inflammation-likely proxy systemic inflammation- patient report outcome ( e.g . ASDAS-CRP= Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score- C reactive protein , BASDAI= Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index , SF-12 = Short Form- 12 , HBI= Hervey Bradshaw Index PROMIS-29= Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-29 ) , report . Recent unpublished data Dr. Longman 's lab ( collaborator ) suggest distinct intestinal dysbiosis Crohn 's associate SpA . But relationship microbiome MRI change yet determine .

	<detailed_description>IMAGING AND CROHN 'S ASSOCIATED SpA : Crohn 's disease ( CD ) common type inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . It affect estimate 0.7 million patient United States responsible 0.2 million hospitalization year.1 Although gastrointestinal tract primary site inflammation , inflammatory arthritis ( peripheral axial ) affect 12.8-23 % patient Crohn 's Disease2,3 , axial SpA alone report effect 6.7 % 18 % Crohn 's patients.4 However , 2 recent studies5,6 , radiological sacroiliitis report present 27 % 52 % IBD patient . MRI change inflammation precede radiological sacroiliitis year clear occurs . Presence damage x-ray asymptomatic patient may suggest Crohn 's associate axial SpA could underdiagnosed . Since Crohn 's associated SpA often affect young patient , undertreatment miss diagnosis could significant impact health relate quality life ( HR-QoL ) disability prime wage earn child rear years.7 `` Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis '' term use describe patient symptomatic SpA finding plain x-ray . These patient identical symptom radiographic evidence cartilage loss erosion , anti-TNF ( anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ) therapy show effective non-radiographic SpA.8 These patient clinically relevant subgroup , 20 % patient MRI evidence sacroiliitis progress non-reversible radiographic SpA two years.9 Therefore , MRI evidence sacroiliitis , conjunction inflammatory back pain sufficient diagnosis SpA . In fact , MRI image standard component current SpA diagnostic criterion , ( ASAS : Assessment SpondyloArthritis International Society ) ,10 MRI change sacroiliitis routinely use identify SpA patient clinical trials.11 However , despite new definition deficiency publish research evaluate clinical significance MRI find patient Crohn 's disease . Of SpA-associated disease , Crohn's-associated SpA particularly high burden extra-articular inflammation . Studies suggest half two third patient CT MRI evidence inflammation symptom inflammatory back pain.1,12 This suggest Crohn 's disease , MRI image biomarkers may identify early disease , analogous way ultrasound identify subclinical rheumatoid arthritis.13 We therefore hypothesize mixed cohort Crohn 's patient without inflammatory back pain , MRI image biomarkers correlate measure health status reflect systemic inflammatory burden , ( i.e . BASDAI , SF-12 ) independent symptom inflammatory back pain . MRI IMAGING BIOMARKERS : A POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTOR ? The observed discordance axial inflammation see MRI inflammatory back pain raise particularly intrigue clinical question : could Crohn 's patient image evidence axial inflammation without axial symptom potentially benefit therapy ? It well establish rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis , systemic inflammation associate myocardial infarction , stroke death , treat inflammation improve cardiovascular outcomes.14,15 . Recent population base study Europe Canada show increase risk cardiovascular mortality patient Ankylosing Spondylitis.16,17 Despite clear evidence cardiovascular risk increase SpA , quantify increase risk straightforward . There consistently reliable marker systemic inflammation patient ; sedimentation rate ( ESR ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) may always reflect ongoing inflammation , especially patient non-radiographic axial SpA9 . Therefore , accurately measure inflammatory burden Crohn 's patient , regardless musculoskeletal symptom , important area future research . Initiation earlier target therapy decrease inflammation may prevent incident Crohn 's associated SpA , progression prevalent SpA , concurrent improvement HRQoL , may also improve cardiovascular morbidity mortality . In addition , although sacroiliitis primary axial feature SpA , increase evidence also spinal involvement even absence SI joint inflammation . Recent study suggest spinal inflammation occur one-third nonradiographic SpA patient &lt; 5 year disease duration.18 This could important early imaging inflammatory biomarker . To knowledge publish study evaluate spinal SI joint MRI image biomarkers Crohn 's associate SpA . THE MICROBIOME : A CORRELATE OF INFLAMMATION IN CROHN 'S DISEASE ? The etiopathogenesis Crohn 's Disease-associated SpA remain puzzle . As autoimmune disease , interplay genetic factor HLA B27 ( Human Leukocyte Antigen- B27 ) environmental factor likely play role . The joint symptom SpA consistently correlate bowel disease flares.19 Intestinal microbiota play critical role evolution entire immune system , since axenic laboratory animal ( germfree animal raise sterile environment ) note partial restoration T cell population animal colonize filamentous bacteria . A symbiotic relationship main bacterial phylum necessary proper function immune system , since notable alteration intestinal microbiome ( i.e . dysbiosis ) suggest various autoimmune disease . Reduction taxa-diversity ( , enterobacteriaceae , Bacteroidales Clostridiales ) expansion certain phyla intestine recently report large cohort new onset treatment-na√Øve Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patients.20 In addition , Dr. Longman 's lab show expansion immunologically relevant Enterobacteriaceae correlate Crohn 's related SpA among mixed group patient Crohn 's ulcerative colitis , ( press ) . However , excite data , SpA case identify use non-validated clinical diagnosis , without systematic rheumatology evaluation image study . This first study evaluate microbiome carefully phenotyped cohort Crohn 's associated SpA , also detailed MRI imaging .</detailed_description>
