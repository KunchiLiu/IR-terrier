	<detailed_description>This cross-over study ( double 5x5 latin square design ) include 10 young healthy subject ( 5 male , 5 female ) .These subject study two different situation : situation good chewing efficiency , situation disturb chew . This second situation simulate wear occlusal appliance interfere chew experimentally lead poor masticatory efficiency . The overall study conduct two distinct protocol . The first protocol `` Food bolus '' dedicate study rheological property food bolus include analysis release amino acid bioactive peptide ( secondary objective ) . The second protocol `` Bioavailability '' study bioavailability bioactive compound target ( main objective ) . Each volunteer participate protocol . The session , without occlusal appliance , randomize individually subject . Each subject control confound factor relate individual variability mastication general function digestive tract therefore minimize . Meat model pork ( Longissimus dorsi ) . Meat slice 2 cm thick , two type cook apply : 10 min cook 75 ° C 45 min cook 90 °C . Meat present volunteer form pre-calibrated cube ( 2x2x2 cm ) 7 g. Protocol 1 : Sampling `` food bolus '' study This part study allow complete description physical / rheological property bolus good poor mastication pork meat cook accord 2 previously describe condition . The analysis property follow along chew sequence , bolus swallowing . For , boli collect different moment sequence mastication . Subjects stop chew indicated experimenter , spat entire bolus saliva . This protocol also allow release carnosine amino acid meat matrix mastication study . Protocol 2 : Sampling 'bioavailability ' study The volunteer participate five sampling day . The determination kinetics appearance peripheral blood target bioactive compound ( carnosine , lycopene ) well release amino acid , do ingestion mixed meal ( meat , tomato , pasta ) , condition normal poor chewing . Meal prepare 100 g cook meat ( low cooking high cooking meat ) , 40 g tomato puree , 10 ml olive oil , 80 g raw pasta . An additional meal contain calcium test normal chew condition low cooking meat . Meals test different day . These day space least 7 day .</detailed_description>
