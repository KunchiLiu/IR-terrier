	<brief_summary>There little evidence show adjuvant therapy show extend survival patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) receive surgical resection . We investigate whether injection highly-purified Cytotoxic T lymphocytes prolongs recurrence-free survival patient resection HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resection+Highly Purified CTL Versus Resection Alone HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common third leading cause cancer-related death worldwide . Resection consider main curative treatment HCC , recurrence tumor within liver remnant common , report 5-year recurrence rate 70 % , result poor prognosis HCC , high recurrence rate lead effort develop adjuvant therapy reduce recurrence . However , benefit form adjuvant therapy remain unclear . Current guideline n't recommend adjuvant therapy resection . A previous clinical trial Japan report cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cell immunotherapy increase recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) surgical resection HCC . Immunotherapy become optional treatment HCC . Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) , kind effective T cell specific recognize kill antigen target cell clone amplification receive antigen information antigen present cell play key role clear cancerous cell . There little evidence adjuvant CTL treatment HCC receive resection . So hypothesis adjuvant highly-purified CTL superior resection alone HCC . The aim prospective study compare outcome resection combine highly-purified CTL resection HCC .</detailed_description>
