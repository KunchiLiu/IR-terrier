	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety efficacy Tumor Associated Peptide Antigen ( TAPA ) pulse dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine treatment hematologic malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Consolidation Therapy Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose hematologic malignancy ( define ) respond conventional therapy , without potentially curative therapeutic intervention , candidate Phase I/II study . Following confirmation disease response conventional antineoplastic therapy , eligible patient agree participate sign consent form tumor cell and/or blood analyzed expression specific panel Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens ( TAPAs ) , include SP17 , Ropporin , AKAP4 , PTTG1 Span-xb . Patients whose tumor express one ( 1 ) TAPAs receive three ( 3 ) day subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) increase bone marrow production monocyte dendritic cell ( DC ) precursor , peripheral blood mononuclear cell obtain phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis generation autologous DCs . Patient 's DCs generate Kiromic 's Cell Processing Good Manufacturing Process ( GMP ) facility , accord establish Standard Operating Procedures , activate pulsing/loading TAPA ( ) relevant particular patient . Patients receive five ( 5 ) day low-dose cyclophosphamide prior vaccination TAPA-pulsed DCs decrease Treg activity . TAPA-pulsed DCs administer fix dose 1 x 107 DCs least two ( 2 ) day follow cyclophosphamide administration . DC vaccination schedule every fourteen ( 14 ) day via subcutaneous ( SC ) intradermal ( ID ) injection total 6 vaccination . Low dose GM-CSF also administer SC five ( 5 ) consecutive day , start three ( 3 ) six ( 6 ) hour TAPA-pulsed DC treatment , optimize immune response DC viability vivo . Patients follow weekly basis ( frequently require ) evaluate treatment-related toxicity . Immune response anti-tumor response evaluate per protocol specification . Continuation stop rule study define base toxicity/tolerability ( Phase I ) and/or immune response ( Phase II ) .</detailed_description>
