	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . 2 . Age 4575 year 3 . UPDRS III motor score ( PD medication ) ≥ 25 4 . Demonstrated good response ( ≥ 30 % ) Sinemet dopamine agonist medication assess total UPDRS III score ( med ) 5 . Approved unilateral subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) DBS surgery treat clinical motor sign plan undergo standard care procedure within next four month 6 . Cleared scan 7 tesla magnet 7 . Written documentation willingness participate study per protocol evidence informed consent process 1 . Clinically significant medical disease would increase risk develop pre postoperative complication ( e.g. , significant cardiac pulmonary disease ) 2 . Evidence secondary atypical parkinsonism 3 . Dementia evidence impairment two neuropsychological domain impaired borderline neuropsychological function one additional domain . 4 . Unable undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( e.g. , due incompatible implanted pacemaker ) 5 . Previous pallidotomy DBS surgery 6 . Women currently pregnant breast feeding 7 . MRI show cortical atrophy proportion age and/or MRI show focal brain lesion could indicate nonidiopathic movement disorder 8 . Any prior intracranial surgery 9 .
