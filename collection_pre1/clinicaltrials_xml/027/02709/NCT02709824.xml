	<detailed_description>In first phase , `` immediate '' objective subjective evaluation dental discoloration spectroscopic ( CIE L*a*b* data analysis DeltaE evaluation ) questionnaire-based analysis record . Immediate visual analysis tooth pigmentation evaluate volunteer him/herself , use mirror , single dentist soon end treatment . Participants indicate presence/absence dental pigmentation , quantify numeric scale ( 0= pigmentation 10= strong pigmentation ) . These analysis perform baseline 21-days-long cycle mouthwash . A wash-out period cycle 21 day perform . In second `` late '' phase , long-term subjective evaluation dental discoloration obtain mean visual analysis clinical photograph new questionnaire . After 6 month clinical trial ( second stage study ) , frontal dental image volunteer , collect first phase , print photographic paper , , visually analyze , blind , 22 volunteer , well 14 dentist 13 oral hygienist ad hoc recruit . Dentists oral hygienist , particular , ask observe two image 22 subject , i.e . treatment A B mouthwash , answer question : `` Which picture show pigment teeth ? '' Possible answer : `` A , B difference two image '' . Pigmentation also quantify use numeric scale ( 0= pigmentation 10=strong pigmentation ) . The observer instruct color teeth appear case CHX pigmentation .</detailed_description>
