	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well dasatinib , nilotinib , imatinib mesylate work treat patient newly diagnose , previously untreated chronic myeloid leukemia few 10 % cell blood bone marrow blast cell ( immature blood cell ) ( chronic phase ) . Dasatinib , nilotinib , imatinib mesylate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess incidence major molecular response ( MMR ) 12 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) 12 24 month . II . To assess accelerated phase ( AP ) blast phase ( BP ) transformation-free survival 12 24 month . III . To assess incidence deep MRs ( ≥ MR⁴ ) 12 month 24 month . IV . To assess safety . V. To assess patient report outcome ( PRO ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess prognostic significance detect aberrant myeloid lymphoid marker diagnostic bone marrow . II . To assess ability enroll subject maintain deep molecular remission tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) discontinuation trial . OUTLINE : Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) day ( QD ) nilotinib PO twice day ( BID ) discretion treat hematologist . Patients achieve either 1 log reduction 3 month 2 log reduction 6 month breakpoint cluster region-abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 ( BCR-ABL1 ) transcript level may switch imatinib mesylate PO QD . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week 60 month .</detailed_description>
