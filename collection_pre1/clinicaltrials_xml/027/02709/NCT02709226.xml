	<brief_summary>Background : A glioblastoma tumor brain . It treat surgery , chemotherapy radiation therapy . However , people tumor come back therapy . When tumor grow back , surgery chemotherapy may possible may longer work . Repeat radiation therapy re-irradiation , option treat tumor regrow . Objective : To find safety high tolerate dose re-irradiation people recurrent glioblastoma . Eligibility : People age 18 50 glioblastoma treat radiation regrown . Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam MRI brain : They lie machine take picture brain . Participants baseline test start therapy . These include : Blood test Neuropsychological test : These test thing like memory , attention , think . Quality life questionnaire Eye hearing test Participants get CT brain prior radiation start order plan radiation treatment . Once plan complete , receive radiation day Monday Friday total 10 17 treatment . They lie back 10 minute get treatment . Participants monitor side effect . After finish treatment , participant visit 1 , 2 , 3 month later . Then every 2 month 3 year . These include : Medical history Physical exam Blood test MRI brain . Quality life questionnaire Neuropsychological test ( visit ) After 3 year , participant contact phone month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Trial Re-irradiation Good Prognosis Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Although survival glioma improve , high grade glioma recur field adjacent treatment field within month year original treatment . In newly diagnose GBM , concurrent use radiation temozolomide standard care . - Surgical resection upon recurrence possible le 50 % patient . For significant proportion recurrent glioma patient reresection favourable systemic option exhaust , re-irradiation emerge possible treatment option . - Using modern precision RT technique ( stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , Rapid Arc technique ) , re-irradiation proven feasible option possible benefit outcome technique often able minimize dose previously treat organ risk field ( OAR ) treat recurrence safely . - Data multiple retrospective study indicate re-irradiation feasible , may actually improve survival appropriately select patient . Objective The primary objective phase I study determine maximum tolerate re-irradiation dose ( MTD ) . Eligibility - Recurrent glioblastoma gliosarcoma - Prior standard radiation therapy dose range 50 60 Gy 1.8 2 Gy per fraction . - Prior irradiation &gt; 12 month enrollment protocol . - Age great equal 18 . - KPS great equal 70 Design - Radiation therapy administer daily Monday-Friday Radiation Oncology Branch ( ROB ) , NCI . All protocol relate follow-up appointment occur NCI ROB . Radiation therapy dose administer consecutive treatment day , 5 fraction per week via linear accelerator use 6 MV photon great . Using 3 plus 3 design , three dose escalation level , 6 patient per dose level 9 total patient MTD ( provide DLT ) , maximum 21 evaluable patient enrol . - Time progression determine interval initiation treatment protocol progression per RANO criterion . - Neurologic decline without radiographic evidence tumor designate treatment related toxicity . Survival duration determine interval initiation treatment protocol date death .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Histological diagnosis Previous histologic diagnosis glioblastoma , transformation glioblastoma gliosarcoma establish biopsy resection prior enrollment evident NIH outside pathology . 2 . Patients must age great equal 18 . 3 . Patients KPS great equal 70 % 4 . Prior standard radiation therapy dose range 50 60 Gy 1.8 2 Gy per fraction . 5 . Patients must equal 14 day previous cytotoxic treatment . 6 . Concurrent therapy The concurrent use bevacizumab allow previously initiate tumor progression symptomatic management . Prior temozolomide cytotoxic chemotherapy allow . 7 . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 8 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Prior therapy &lt; 2 week since surgical reresection biopsy 2 . Pregnant breast feeding female exclude due potential mutagenic effect develop fetus newborn 3 . Preexisting grade 3 4 nervous system disorder per CTCAE Version 4.03 4 . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( include limit active life threaten infection , cardiac neurologic event , current hospital admission coexist comorbid illness ) , would make impossible patient tolerate reirradiation systemic chemotherapy likely interfere result . 5 . Patients exhibit baseline grade 3 4 CTCAE criterion exclude due difficulty assign study intervention treatment related DLT . 6 . Patients preexist know suspected radiation sensitivity syndrome exclude due potential confounding effect outcome .</criteria>
