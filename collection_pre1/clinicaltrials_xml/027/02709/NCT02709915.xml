	<brief_title>Effect Meal Frequency Timing Insulin Dose Clock Gene Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese patient type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) insulin resistance ( IR ) , often require sequential increment total daily insulin dose ( TDID ) . This cause weight gain , worsen IR , lead increase TDID persistent hyperglycemia . In patient , weight loss ( WL ) reduction IR mandatory order achieve glucose control less TDID . Impaired clock gene ( CG ) expression link obesity IR T2D show animal T2D patient treat oral anti-hyperglycemic drug , WL diet restrict meal timing specific hour , restore CG expression effective WL reduction hyperglycemia compare isocaloric WL diet , ( commonly recommend T2D ) , consist small meal randomly distribute along day . The investigator hypothesize patient uncontrolled T2D treat insulin , diet large breakfast lunch small dinner ( Bdiet ) enhance CG expression effective WL achieve glycemic control reduction TDID , compare isocaloric diet 6 small meal distribute evenly along day ( 6Mdiet ) . This randomized parallel , open label clinical study . Thirty overweight obese insulin-treated T2D patient HbA1c &gt; 7.5 % assign 12 week 2 isocaloric diet : either Bdiet 6Mdiet . HbA1c CG mRNA expression white blood cell overall daily glycemia measure 5 day , assessed end diet intervention . The TDID adjust physician , accord result self-monitoring blood glucose 3 consecutive day baseline visit .</detailed_description>
