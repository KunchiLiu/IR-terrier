	<brief_summary>Fatigue frequently report symptom patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , whether Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Sometimes fatigue may easily explain symptom test show disease active . For example patient may anaemic ( low blood count ) lead feeling tired time . Treatment disease make patient feel less fatigue . However , 4 5 every 10 patient IBD felt remission ( ie active disease ) report fatigue . This far-reaching implication patient everyday life , issue around work school , close relationship , travel leisure profoundly affect . The CCUK fund research fatigue IBD , lead Professor Christine Norton Wladzia Czuber-Dochan King 's College London , identify fatigue significant issue face patient also highlight doctor offer help support beyond treat disease active . This partly fatigue difficult measure study design treat fatigue would limit unable quantify improvement meaningful way . Fortunately King 's College group develop 'fatigue score ' simple questionnaire able quantify severity fatigue . The aim study assess effect structure support educational programme level fatigue patient inactive IBD report moderate severe level fatigue . A secondary component study see association fatigue level disease activity parameter quality life , anxiety symptom overlap irritable bowel syndrome . Patients approach out-patient telephone clinic study explain write information question answer . If agree involve ask complete fatigue number questionnaires addition standard assessment symptom , blood test stool specimen . Patients active disease exclude subsequent group intervention data provide point still helpful understand fatigue IBD . Patients identified remission follow initial assessment offer opportunity involve next stage study . The stool sample also analyse microbiome ie bacteria present study suggest patient IBD may reduce diversity bacteria intestine . Half group randomise active intervention half act control group rest study . The active intervention involve completion activity diary follow two week analysis diary agreement behaviour change design help fatigue . This support write information three , monthly small group session reinforce support change . At end study patient complete fatigue quality life questionnaire disease activity assess symptom score , blood stool test . The baseline result final result analyse see improvement fatigue group undergo programme support behaviour change . This small pilot study demonstrate intervention feasible may help fatigue large study perform try confirm initial finding . Our ultimate aim find simple intervention empower patient deal difficult task live IBD fatigue bring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background 41 % - 48 % patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , remission , experience fatigue ( 1 ) . Fatigue associate significant physical , emotional , psychological social consequence ( 2 ) . This wide-reaching implication patient everyday life , issue around work productivity , academic achievement , close relationship , travel leisure profoundly affect . Based data CCUK national lottery-funded research fatigue , although 68 % respond IBD treat professional felt fatigue adequately treatable less half offer anything check haemoglobin level treat low , around one third offer lifestyle related advice diet , exercise sleep ( 3 ) . The CCUK fund research fatigue IBD lead Professor Christine Norton Wladzia Czuber-Dochan identify fatigue significant issue face patient also develop objective fatigue score quantify . Leading King 's College team study role diet exercise fatigue . Aims propose investigation Our study aim address two key question : 1 . Do patient active IBD high fatigue score patient inactive disease ? This question address screen selection patient come specialist IBD clinic . Some active disease assess exclude interventional study . Others inactive disease recruit study , able compare fatigue score active inactive disease group . In addition explore association fatigue score anxiety/depression , somatisation score , quality life , overlap IBS symptom faecal microbiome . 2 . Can intervention planned behavioural change improve symptom fatigue patient inflammatory bowel disease remission ? We believe study complement exist work fatigue offering structure psychoeducational intervention centre around self-management booklet group-work . The primary outcome study assess fatigue IBD remission cohort . The study undertaken Lisa Warren supervision Dr Anthony O'Connor Dr John Hamlin input Debbie Pullen ( mental health nurse specialist ) Anna Errington ( occupational therapist , department liason psychiatry ) . Secondary outcome large study could cascade pilot would assess decrease risk flare improve quality life patient fatigue adequately manage . Detailed plan investigation methodology All patient screen study require give inform consent . In order recruit propose study number active intervention estimate screen approximately 100 patient . A large number patient may exclude active intervention study baseline clinical laboratory investigation , complete part standard disease assessment , suggest active disease . However data collect patient still provide valuable information fatigue patient IBD , association fatigue score severity active disease , parameter somatisation score ( assessed PHQ15 form ) , quality life ( SIBDQ &amp; SF36 ) , overlap IBD symptom ( Rome III criterion ) , anxiety depression ( HAD score ) . Patients identified remission offer opportunity involve psychoeducational interventional study . The study explain write information question answer . If agree involve ask complete fatigue questionnaire addition questionnaires address anxiety/depression ( HAD ) , somatisation ( PHQ15 ) , overlap irritable bowel syndrome symptom ( Rome III ) , quality life ( SIBDQ &amp; SF36 ) . In addition , patient standard assessment disease activity symptom , blood test , stool specimen . The stool sample send faecal calprotectin measurement non-invasive sensitive marker bowel inflammation . The stool sample also store future assessment faecal microbiome ( different bacteria intestine ) order examine association disease activity , fatigue score , parameter assess questionnares . Patients active inflammation base symptom , blood test , stool calprotectin level exclude subsequent psychological intervention aspect study . Those inactive disease randomize , conceal envelope , two group . The first group act control continue current management . The active intervention group complete activity diary follow two week . The active intervention analysis activity diary agreement behaviour change design help fatigue . This support write information three , monthly small group session reinforce support change . At end study patient complete fatigue questionnaire outline disease activity assess symptom score , blood stool test . The baseline result final result analyse see improvement fatigue group undergo programme support behaviour change . This small pilot study , demonstrate intervention feasible may help fatigue , large study perform try confirm initial finding . Our data also help inform IBD specialist patient factor may play role common symptom fatigue . Our ultimate aim find simple intervention empower patient deal difficult task live IBD fatigue bring . Our active intervention study group patient inactive disease , order avoid confound factor . Those patient inactive disease complete activity diaries half randomise active intervention . As proven intervention treat IBD-related fatigue forsee ethical problem relate half patient randomise intervention , exist treatment . The psychoeducational intervention behaviour change centre around self-management booklet make IBD clinical nurse specialist , support mental health team train intervention . Participants : We plan recruit 20 IBD patient , 10 Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) 10 Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) disease remission active intervention arm 20 IBD patient remission control group . Remission CD define Harvey-Bradshaw Index ( HBI ) &lt; 5 C-reactive protein ( CRP ) &lt; 5 . For UC define partial Mayo score â‰¤2 CRP &lt; 5 . For group faecal calprotectin ( FC ) &gt; 250ug/g regard indicate active disease exclude patient study . Patients also exclude anaemic ( Hb &lt; 14g/dL male , 11.5g/dL female ) . In CD arm patient assess Vitamin B12 Vitamin D status exclude B12 le 300 pmol/l Vitamin D le 30 ng/mL . Interventions : We intend commence recruitment January 2016 via twice-weekly IBD out-patient clinic addition nurse-led telephone clinic . We aim complete recruitment within 3 month intervention schedule begin February . At week zero patient provide information leaflet study process explain question answer . Those patient give informed consent screen baseline measurement include CCUK fatigue score , addition complete questionnaire outline methodology . Baseline blood stool sample take assess disease activity . Patients deem active disease exclude rest study medical management optimise line local national guideline . Those patient meet inclusion criterion provide activity diary ask complete follow 4 week . All patient baseline data analyse study association fatigue score disease activity ( measure HBI/Mayo score , CRP , FC ) , quality life ( measure SF36 &amp; S-IBDQ ) , anxiety depression ( HAD ) somatisation ( PHQ15 ) . After exclude patient active disease randomise study population two group . Randomisation allocation conceal envelope physician involve study . The nature study mean blind . As pilot study exist data effect intervention fatigue perform power calculation study population size . The active group analysis activity diary agree behaviour change . This group three subsequent visit take place monthly basis week 20 , consist small group work 4 patient per session reinforce behaviour change . At week 20 , patient come 6th final visit response assess . This involve disease assessment clinical index , repeat blod stool sample completion questionnaires baseline . The control group standard medical management also review week 20 undergo assessment . Comparators : Age , sex disease match control identify IBD clinic . Outcomes : At sixth visit ( week 20 ) Fatigue score ( questionnaire outline ) , CRP , FC HBI partial Mayo Score obtain . Timetable Potential application result , include benefit people live IBD We feel patient fatigue remission currently sufficient access intervention design specifically manage fatigue symptom . In CCUK fatigue study clear message professional wish great array evidence base intervention offer patient circumstance . We believe intervention , offer support non-pharmacologic self-management , empower worthwhile . We feel work would complement sterling work undertaken CCUK fatigue IBD recent year . Interest express throughout Yorkshire Humber Royal College Nursing IBD Network use booklet method prove effective . Dissemination intention We expect publish finding abstract form hopeful pilot study enable u assess feasibility commence MSc PhD project facilitate group work fatigue management IBD cohort . Dr Hamlin conversation Wladzia Czuber-Dochan King 's College group discuss proposal . They feel interest project conflict exist study . They also express interest collaborate u future study pilot study provide interest preliminary data . Key reference 1 .
