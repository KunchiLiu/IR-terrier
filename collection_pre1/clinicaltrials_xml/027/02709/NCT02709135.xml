	<detailed_description>Approximately 8-10 million patient complain chest pain present Emergency Department ( ED ) annually United States . These patient challenge healthcare provider , task determine whether symptom due acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) non-ACS cause . Missing diagnosis ACS associate high rate morbidity , mortality , malpractice claim . Therefore , avoid miss diagnosis ACS , patient chest pain typically undergo extensive evaluation estimate cost $ 10-13 billion annually . However , less 10 % patient ultimately diagnose ACS . As US healthcare system shifts towards value-based model , clear current care pattern acute chest pain , fail focus health system resource , hospitalization cardiac testing , patient likely benefit , sustainable . In effort improve quality value care patient acute chest pain , group recently validate risk stratification pathway , HEART Pathway , design focus cardiac test admission higher-risk patient , likely benefit test . The HEART Pathway , utilizes easy use clinical decision aid ( HEART score ) serial troponin measurement , show significantly reduce objective cardiac testing ( stress test coronary angiography ) , shorten hospital length stay , increase early discharge rate Emergency Department among patient acute chest pain . These important efficiency gain occur without miss ACS without increase return visit ED downstream admission hospital 30 day period . While HEART score well validate ED setting , yet implement prehospital setting . Paramedics often first provider evaluate begin treat patient symptom concern ACS . Current pre-hospital risk stratification largely base combination ECG result paramedic gestalt . Since ECGs without sign STEMI poor predictor ACS , paramedic often difficulty distinguish high-risk patient low-risk patient . Therefore , integrate objective risk stratification tool , HEART score point-of-care troponin testing , Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) triage destination plan represent opportunity improve care . Furthermore , expand use HEART score paramedic pre-hospital set natural extension prior work , especially give grow sophistication mobile integrate healthcare ( `` community paramedicine '' ) last decade . Thus , multidisciplinary leader within Emergency Medicine , Cardiology , Prehospital Medicine agree limited/pilot evaluation HEART Score Abbott 's i-STAT® point-of-care ( POC ) troponin test prehospital setting need . The investigator anticipate standardize approach paramedic risk stratification use HEART score Abbott 's i-STAT® POC troponin test feasible achieve high accuracy detection ACS . Ultimately investigator believe plan implementation improve quality value chest pain care . Placing tool hand first responder identify patient ACS early speed delivery potentially life-saving care . For example , EMS triage destination plan ( chest pain treatment transportation triage destination plan ) could amend patient positive POC troponins high HEART score could transport directly hospital cardiac catheterization capability , avoid delay cost associate inter-facility transfer . However , EMS triage destination plan fully incorporate HEART score POC troponin testing , first feasibility implementation must establish collect quality surveillance data . To establish feasibility accuracy HEART score POC test prehospital setting investigator propose quality surveillance study limit implementation HEART score POC troponin test . This pilot include paramedic three demographically distinct county ( Forsyth , Surry , Stokes county ) North Carolina , begin use HEART score i-STAT POC Troponin part risk assessment patient acute chest pain . However , EMS triage transportation plan alter base HEART score assessment feasibility accuracy establish . To ensure feasibility accuracy paramedic chest pain risk assessment investigator perform surveillance electronic health record ( EHR ) contact patient phone ( common practice EMS quality assurance ) . Quality surveillance participant ( n=500 ) identify retrospectively quality assurance data collect electronically use EHR ( EMS record , Wake Forest Baptist Health health record ) via telephone follow-up call ( customary EMS quality assurance project ) .</detailed_description>
