	<brief_summary>This study evaluate systemic urine pharmacokinetics spontaneously breathe healthy volunteer follow single dose amikacin/fosfomycin , use PARI Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System PARI LC Sprint Nebulizer . Three dos ( 30/12 mg , 60/24 mg , 90/36 mg amikacin/fosfomycin ) evaluate . Following evaluation , single dose nebulizer choose evaluate systemic , bronchoalveolar , urine pharmacokinetics spontaneously breathe healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Phase 1 Study Aerosolized Amikacin Fosfomycin Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 open-label study three dos amikacin/fosfomycin . Approximately 30 healthy volunteer dose five cohort six subject . The first ( sentinel ) subject first three cohort dose alone . If significant safety tolerability event occur , remain five subject first three cohort dose . The first cohort ( n=6 ) administer 30/12 mg dose amikacin/fosfomycin . The second cohort ( n=6 ) administer 60/24 mg dose amikacin/fosfomycin . The third cohort ( n=6 ) administer 90/36 mg dose amikacin/fosfomycin . All dose cohort 1 , 2 , 3 deliver PARI Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System . The fourth cohort ( n=6 ) administer 90/36 mg dose amikacin/fosfomycin use PARI LC Sprint Nebulizer . The fifth cohort ( n=6 ) test low dose level subject achieve &gt; 0.3 µg/mL amikacin peak serum concentration . The nebulizer use deliver dose cohort 5 determined amikacin concentration cohorts 1 4 reviewed .</detailed_description>
