	<detailed_description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) pathogen find worldwide infects human cause tuberculosis ( TB ) , transmissible disease result high mortality morbidity . It estimate third world 's population latently infect M.tb , people carry 10 % lifetime risk develop active life-threatening disease . In 2013 , 9 million new case worldwide 1.5 million people die TB . Co-infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) greatly increase risk TB reactivation death . TB diagnosis challenge drug treatment prolong , harmful , costly complex . For reason effective vaccine global public health priority . Currently ass vaccine efficacy TB reliable alternative large , randomize control trial . These efficacy trial novel TB vaccine challenge , time consume costly . For disease , malaria , challenge study informative . The development safe control human mycobacterial challenge model would ultimately validated field efficacy study could greatly facilitate TB vaccine development guide select candidate TB vaccine take forward large efficacy trial . TB041 clinical challenge trial primarily evaluate safety BCG challenge administer aerosol inhale route healthy , BCG naive UK adult . The trial also look evaluate compare amount BCG recover lung skin , follow challenge either aerosol intradermal route .</detailed_description>
