SETTING This study perform 50 European hospital Spain , Italy , Greece , Turkey , Serbia , Croatia , Montenegro , Kosovo , Albania , Bulgaria Romania . STUDY PERIOD The recruitment period study plan February 2016 June 2017 . ENDPOINTS ( MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES ) See STUDY VARIABLES AND DEFINITIONS - CRE : isolate identify Enterobacteriaceae show minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) ≥1 mg/L use dilution method and/or ≤22 mm use disc-diffusion method imipenem meropenem ( 10 µg disk ) ; others consider carbapenem susceptible ( CSE ) , meropenem imipenem susceptible isolates show resistance ertapenem exclude . - CRAB : Any isolate identify Acinetobacter baumannii show minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) ≥16 mg/L imipenem meropenem use dilution method and/or ≤17 mm meropenem and/or ≤15 imipenem use disc-diffusion method . - Independent variable Study 1 : demographic , comorbidities adult ( Charlson 's index ) , comorbidities child ( ARPEC PPS definition ) , type acquisition , systemic inflammatory response syndrome severity adult , sepsis criterion child , Pitt score , SOFA score , APACHE-II score , PIM2 , invasive procedure , neutropenia , microbiological variable ( poly monomicrobial infection , carbapenemase producer , carbapenemases type , susceptibility profile , carbapenem MIC ) , clinical management ( source control support therapy ) , antimicrobial therapy . - Independent variable Study 2 : demographic , length hospital stay , epidemiological variable ( travel , previous contact person colonise CRE , previous hospitalization , nurse home long term-care facility residency , previous colonisation CRE ) , comorbidities , acquisition type , SIRS severity adult , sepsis child , Pitt score , SOFA score , APACHE-II score , PIM2 , invasive procedure , neutropenia , type infection , microbiological variable , antibiotic receive last 3 month . - Independent variable Study 3 : include Study 2 . DATA COLLECTION AND FOLLOW-UP Data collect trained local investigator . Patients follow 30 day day 0 . Data prior study entry collect review medical record interview patient , his/her family attend healthcare staff . After , patient follow prospectively . If patient discharge assessement , outcome must assess outpatient visit phone call accord pre-design questionnaire . MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES . All procedure perform locally use accept , standard microbiological protocol . Isolates identify CRE CRAB accord criterion locally study carbapenemase production use CARBA-NP test . Susceptibility test key antimicrobial agent collect . Isolates preservation CRE CRAB isolate preserve locally least -20ºC . SAFETY ASSESMENT No investigation drug use study . Adverse event collect follow-up one variable interest analysis purpose . SAMPLE SIZE : - Study 1 The sample size CRE CRAB cohort calculate cohort may serve 'historical ' cohort future comparison new drug CRE CRAB . To , estimate outcome variable new drug unknown , seek estimate clinical cure rate BAT 95 % confidence interval 8 % precision . For estimate cure rate 50 % base data previous study , 151 patient five type infection need ( due CRE : cUTI , pneumonia , cIAI , BSI ; due CRAB : BSI ) . However , around 25 % patient receive BAT , need 201 patient per type infection except BSI due A. baumannii , need 221 blood isolates identify Acinetobacter spp sit specify specie A. baumannii ( total , 1025 patient ) . Such sample size enough also investigate best available therapy merge CRE cohort . - Study 2 : The CRE case group form 248 patient CRE infection select study 1 cohort . Per CRE case , one CSE control patient 3 non-infected control select . Because possible heterogeneity due different infection type , choose sample ratio 248/201*100 % . The number match control choose four well know well approximate power full cohort data . - Study 3 The CRE , CSE non-infected cohort form patient Study 2 . Therefore , sample size rationale Study 2 , however refinement nested case control match view exposure density sample . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - Study 1 . The outcome associate exposure different variable compare ; target exposure empirical active antimicrobial therapy , early target optimized therapy , early source control . Antimicrobial regimen analyse empirical ( administered susceptibility test available ) target ( thereafter ) therapy . The primary endpoint `` mortality cause day 30 '' analyse use survival method ( Kaplan-Meier , Cox regression ) . The primary endpoint `` clinical response TOC '' analyse dichotomous outcome , regression analysis use logistic regression model . The analysis secondary endpoint analogous . Microbiological response TOC polychotomous outcome analyse use multinomial logistic regression . Goodness fit assess throughout . Variable selection base Akaike 's information criterion . - Study 2 . Exposure potential risk factor patient compare CRE case CSE control , CRE case admit control . A stratified weighted Cox analysis perform . Multilevel hospital data ( local rate CRE , antimicrobial consumption , infection control measure ) also consider analysis . - Study 3 . The impact CRE infection mortality , length stay , cost , length hospital ICU stay , length mechanical ventilation patient assess comparison CSE infection admit patient . All time-to-event outcome ( cost extra hospital/ICU day see ) compare use survival technique . Because outcome infection due CRE subject compete risk death hospital w/o CRE infection discharge alive hospital without CRE infection , analyse shall supplement compete outcome . Goodness fit assess throughout . Extra hospital/ICU day estimate use multistate approach Beyersmann et al . Variable selection base Akaike 's information criterion . Goodness fit assess throughout . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS . Prior initiation study site , approval seek appropriate regulatory agency local Ethics Committees Research IRBs conduct study accordance regulatory requirement . This observational study therefore intervention perform behalf investigation . Management patient include antibiotic regimen prescribe decide physician doctor/team charge without interference . The processing patient ' personal data collect study shall comply Data Protection Act 1998 European Directive Privacy Data . MONITORING The study monitor quality consistency data .</detailed_description>
