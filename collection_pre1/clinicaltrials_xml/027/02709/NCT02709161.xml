	<brief_title>Effects Amygdala Neurofeedback Depressive Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research show real-time fMRI neurofeedback ( rtfMRI-nf ) training aim increase amygdala 's response positive autobiographical memory recall hold therapeutic potential treating patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , clinically significant decrease clinician administer self-report measure depression severity observe follow two rtfMRI amygdala neurofeedback session . Furthermore , rtfMRI amygdala neurofeedback change emotional processing towards positive bias . As rtfMRI-nf procedure utilizes principle cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , include restructure thought emotional processing towards positive , current study seek examine effect augment CBT amygdala rtfMRI-nf . Specifically , investigator plan test hypothesis pretreatment two amygdala rtfMRI-nf session prior start CBT result high percentage patient exhibit 'sudden gain ' ( session drop least 25 % Beck Depression Inventory associate well treatment response ) compare receive rtfMRI-nf parietal control region putatively involved emotional processing . Over course three year , 60 participant diagnose MDD plan start CBT recruit clinical service Western Psychiatric Institute Clinic ( WPIC ) license CBT therapist Pittsburgh metropolitan area . Participants undergo two rtfMRI-nf session within two week prior start therapy . Half participant receive amygdala neurofeedback half receive control neurofeedback . At week 1-3 9 &amp; 10 follow start therapy , participant complete BDI-II NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Depression measure . The number patient meet criterion sudden gain average session occur compare CBT + amygdala rtfMRI-nf CBT + control rtfMRI-nf group . Success suggest new method improve outcome CBT depress patient .</detailed_description>
