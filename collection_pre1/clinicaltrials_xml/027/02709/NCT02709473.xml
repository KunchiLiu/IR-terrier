	<brief_summary>Rapid sequence induction ( RSI ) well-known procedure maintain safe rapid airway patient especially risk aspiration . Propofol rocuronium generally use agent RSI . However , difficult airway scenario always valid patient , even without predictive sign difficult airway . Therefore , important decrease rocuronium dose use RSI achieve rapid recovery neuromuscular conduction aid reversal agent case difficult airway . The short acting opioids remifentanil may helpful reduce dose rocuronium RSI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Propofol Remifentanil Sequence ED50 ED95 Rocuronium Rapid Sequence Induction Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid sequence induction widely use anesthesia technique achieve safe airway control . However , difficult airway may expect patient others . In difficult airway situation , cholinesterase inhibitor sugammadex may use reversal . However , sugammadex always available due cost every hospital . In addition , well-known cholinesterase inhibitor work well case deep neuromuscular block . In consideration information , recovery neuromuscular block gain importance patient undergo RSI difficult airway . Therefore , decrease dosage non-depolarizing neuromuscular agent may helpful case difficult airway situation . With aim decrease neuromuscular blocker dosage , opioid analgesic especially remifentanil preferred combine propofol decrease hemodynamic response laryngoscopy intubation . A recent study demonstrate induction anesthesia remifentanil propofol , ED50 rocuronium acceptable intubation condition 0.20 mg/kg . In another study , author show administration sequence propofol remifentanil target control anesthesia affect onset time rocuronium due change cardiac output . The author conclude prior administration remifentanil decrease cardiac output delay onset time rocuronium . The investigator hypothesize prior administration remifentanil compare propofol may increase ED50 ED95 rocuronium acceptable intubation condition RSI .</detailed_description>
