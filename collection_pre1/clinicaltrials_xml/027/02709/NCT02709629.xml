	<detailed_description>Evidence suggest link diabetes-related process increase risk cognitive decline dementia old adult . Optimal disease self-management may key prevention cognitive decline among old diabetic patient , may compromise due sub-clinical cognitive impairment . In current study , 120 community-dwelling , non-demented participant age 65 , diagnosis Type 2 diabetes randomly assign either 8-week , home-based individually-tailored CCT program adaptive difficulty level , regular performance feedback , 8-week , home-based active control ( AC ) condition , involve train generic CCT program fix difficulty level without performance feedback . Both intervention group also include range theory-informed behavior change technique ( BCTs ) , include self-efficacy management , self-monitoring goal-setting order enhance treatment fidelity , maximize treatment compliance adherence . In group , participant train approx . 30 min . per day , 3 time per-week 8-weeks . Participants undergo comprehensive evaluation outcome baseline , immediately intervention , 6-month follow-up , 1-week booster training complete 3 month completion intervention .</detailed_description>
