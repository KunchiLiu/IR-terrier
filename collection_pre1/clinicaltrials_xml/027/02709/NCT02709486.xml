	<brief_summary>Tanezumab monoclonal antibody bind inhibits action nerve growth factor ( NGF ) . The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor ( NGFI ) class may offer important breakthrough treatment chronic pain clinical investigation treatment pain associate osteoarthritis chronic pain condition . The primary objective study demonstrate superior efficacy tanezumab 5 mg 2.5 mg administer subcutaneously ( SC ) every 8 week versus placebo Week 24 subject osteoarthritis knee hip . The 2.5 mg dose show provide efficacy benefit favorable safety profile administer intravenously previous Phase 3 clinical trial . The 5 mg dose expect provide add efficacy benefit 2.5 mg dose base data previous study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double blind , placebo control , parallel group multicenter Phase 3 study efficacy safety tanezumab administer SC injection 24 week compare placebo subject osteoarthritis knee hip . A total approximately 810 subject randomize 1 3 treatment group 1:1:1 ratio ( ie , 270/group ) . The randomization stratify index joint ( hip knee ) , severe Kellgren-Lawrence grade ( knee hip joint ) study entry ( grade 2 , 3 4 ) . Subjects receive three SC dose one follow treatment 8-week interval injection : 1. tanezumab 2.5 mg ; 2. tanezumab 5 mg ; 3 . Placebo match tanezumab . The study design total ( post-randomization ) duration 48 week consist three period : Screening ( 37 day ) , Double-blind Treatment ( 24 week ) Safety Follow-up ( 24 week ) . The Screening Period ( begin 37 day prior Randomization ) include Washout Period ( last minimum 2 day prohibit pain medication ) , require , Initial Pain Assessment Period ( 7 day prior Randomization/Baseline ) . Week 24 landmark analysis study . Subjects complete Double-blind Treatment period enter complete 24-week Early-termination follow-up period .</detailed_description>
