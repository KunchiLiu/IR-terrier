	<brief_summary>The purpose present study conduct fully-crossed 2 X 2 X 2 factorial randomize control trial diverse sample 224 MSM recruit 2 urban HIV primary care clinic ( one Northeast one South ) . The first study factor compare brief advice ( BA ) vs. motivational intervention ( MI ) contain detailed personalized normative HIV-specific feedback . The second factor compare interactive text messaging ( ITM ) intervention vs. text messaging . The final factor compare intervention low intensity duration ( two session 1 month ) extend intervention ( EI ) entail 5 session 9 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Interventions Reduce Heavy Drinking Among MSM HIV Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heavy drink HIV-infected patient lead low antiretroviral therapy adherence poor virologic control , great sexual risk taking , increase risk liver disease , decrease cognitive function . Therefore , reduction drinking may particularly positive widespread effect HIV-infected patient . Men sex men ( MSM ) continue represent majority new HIV infection , HIV-infected MSM rate hazardous drink high 33 % . Therefore , develop test intervention reduce heavy drinking HIV-infected MSM high public health priority . There relatively alcohol intervention test focus MSM , two address drink HIV-infected MSM . Although recent study indicate behavioral intervention reduce heavy drinking HIV-infected patient , much remain unknown efficacy different approach behavioral intervention unique combine effect . The purpose present study conduct fully-crossed 2 X 2 X 2 factorial randomize control trial diverse sample 224 MSM recruit 2 urban HIV primary care clinic ( one Northeast one South ) . The first study factor compare brief advice ( BA ) vs. motivational intervention ( MI ) contain detailed personalized normative HIV-specific feedback . The second factor compare interactive text messaging ( ITM ) intervention vs. text messaging . The final factor compare intervention low intensity duration ( two session 1 month ) extend intervention ( EI ) entail 5 session 9 month . BA MI deliver core set interventionists central location use webcam-enabled telemedicine system , facilitate larger-scale implementation . The design allow u test hypothesis MI compare BA , ITM compare ITM , EI compare EI , result significantly great reduction number alcoholic drink consume number heavy drinking day 6- 12-month follow-up . Secondary outcome include engagement unprotected anal intercourse , ART adherence viral suppression , CD4 cell count , liver function test , neurocognitive function . We also test hypothesis effect MI , ITM , EI drinking moderate alcohol use disorder status readiness change drink intervention relatively efficacious current disorder low readiness . The study provide crucial evidence regard intervention approach , alone combination , likely efficient implement large scale HIV care setting .</detailed_description>
