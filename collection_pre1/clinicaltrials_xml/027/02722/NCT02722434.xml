	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study well MC5-A scrambler therapy transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) therapy work treat patient chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( nerve problem cause pain , numbness , tingle , swell , muscle weakness different part body ) . MC5-A scrambler therapy type treatment nerve pain use electrode place skin , electricity carry electrodes skin block pain . TENS procedure mild electric current apply area skin . It yet know whether TENS therapy effective MC5-A scrambler therapy treat chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MC5-A Scrambler Therapy TENS Therapy Treating Patients With Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate efficacy scrambler therapy ( MC5-A scrambler therapy ) compare TENS therapy pain and/or tingle related chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) . II . Evaluate tolerability scrambler therapy compare TENS therapy , population . III . Evaluate whether scrambler therapy , compare TENS therapy , decrease use pain medication CIPN . IV . Explore whether messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) gene expression scrambler therapy show similar finding Starkweather et al observe . V. Utilizing high-field magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , define alteration functional difference ( use rest state blood-oxygen-level dependent [ BOLD ] measure measure difference functional connectivity ) treat scrambler device set chemotherapy induce peripheral neuropathy pain . VI . Explore whether scrambler therapy alter sensation . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo MC5-A scrambler therapy 30 minute 10 consecutive weekday . ARM II : Patients undergo TENS therapy 30 minute daily 14 day . Patients Arms , may crossover opposite Arm additional 2 week treatment elect . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 8 week .</detailed_description>
