	<brief_summary>This research study do collect data analyze motion soft tissue abdomen ( liver , pancreas , stomach intestine ) people pancreatic liver cancer well healthy volunteer . During study researcher look movement organ abdomen naturally occur breathe bowel movement . This study examine difference abdominal soft tissue motion healthy volunteer cancer patient goal develop good way manage minimize abdominal soft tissue motion . Accurate location tumor important treatment delivery reduction toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Within last decade , Linac base stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) show effective treatment option pancreas1 , 2 liver3 , 4 tumor . SBRT delivers high dos radiation therapy tumor 1-5 treatment . Because spatial precision SBRT , feasible administer high radiation dose treatment . By minimize amount radiation surround healthy tissue , possible decrease rate toxicity/complication increase radiation dose cancerous tissue , thereby allow well local control . SBRT abdomen limit movement intra-abdominal organ naturally occur respiration bowel movement . Organ motion occur intra- inter-fractionally . While intra-fractional motion result respiration , peristalsis cardiac motion , magnitude inter-fractional target motion dependent daily variation organ fill , weight change , tumor growth radiation induce change tissue . Tumor movement may lead tumor displacement suboptimal dose delivery . Accurate localization target important improve treatment delivery accuracy reduce toxicity treatment . To evaluate tumor motion due breathe motion , 4-D CT simulation scan perform . If tumor move 3 mm breathing cycle , breathe motion management employ use Active Breathing Control ( ABC ) technique . ABC require patient hold his/her breath within proper tidal volume treatment deliver , free breathing may resume period treatment . This technique limit delivery RT specific phase respiratory cycle minimize influence breathing delineate tumor . Despite significant progress make ABC technique , tumor organ motion could minimize eliminate completely technique . Assessing patient specific tumor/organ motion ( intra- interfractional ) throughout course SBRT treatment offer possibility ensure delivery prescribe target dose simultaneously minimize normal tissue damage . In order monitor abdominal soft tissue motion , Department Radiation Oncology develop 4D ultrasound technique base ultrasound probe holder continuous motion monitoring software . The 4D ultrasound image acquire use motorize 3D ultrasound probe image continuously . 4D ultrasound new non-ionizing non-invasive imaging technique continuously monitor tumor motion radiation treatment real time .</detailed_description>
