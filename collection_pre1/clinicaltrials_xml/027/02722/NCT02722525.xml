	<brief_summary>Learning impact anti-androgen treatment cardiac function patient prostate cancer may help plan treatment help patient live comfortably . This pilot clinical trial utilize cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient start hormone therapy 4 7 month hormone therapy . The objective measure impact hormone therapy ( anti-androgen treatment ) cardiac function patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac MRI Measuring Impact Anti-androgen Treatment Cardiac Function Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine impact minimum 4 month full androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) cardiac skeletal muscle structure performance use novel cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) approach . OUTLINE : Study participant undergo treadmill stress CMR focus cardiac muscle comprise rest MRI 10-15 minute follow treadmill exercise peak stress . Patients undergo MRI gadopentetate dimeglumine ( Gd-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid [ DTPA ] ) perfusion image immediately exercise 6-8 minute recovery period . Within 24 hour treadmill CMR exam , patient also undergo skeletal muscle phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( PMRS ) rest , , recovery phase resistive low extremity exercise patient complete 30 second . Both procedure perform initiation ADT treatment ( baseline ) 4-7 month initiation ADT treatment .</detailed_description>
