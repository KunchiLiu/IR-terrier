	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Solely For Liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There potential role systematically implement MRI establish appropriate workflow implementation tumor motion management liver SBRT . Compared CT , MRI many significant advantage radiotherapy planning , include superior tumor soft-tissue contrast , flexible imaging orientation , freedom radiation exposure real-time imaging . MRI solely base liver SBRT allow precise delineation target volume , less uncertainties treatment planning , good motion management , potentially well treatment outcome</detailed_description>
