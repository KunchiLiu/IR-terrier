	<brief_summary>The investigator aim compare rehabilitation progress control patient undergo routine vestibular rehabilitation exercise experimental patient undergo exercise use vibrotactile balance belt ( Sensory Kinetics Balance Rehabilitation System ) addition routine vestibular rehabilitation regimen recovery diseases affect vestibular system . The result pilot study help determine vibrotactile balance belt useful supplement traditional vestibular rehabilitation technique child suffer vestibular impairment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Vibrotactile Balance Belt System Vestibular Rehabilitation Pediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct randomize pilot trial examine efficacy vibrotactile balance belt vestibular rehabilitation pediatric population . All consent patient randomly allocate statistician either experimental group participant undergo SKBRS exercise addition routine vestibular rehabilitation regimen , control group participant undergo routine vestibular rehabilitation exercise without SKBRS . All subject undergo weekly vestibular rehabilitation session 3 month ( total 12 session ) . During session , standard balance training exercise do discretion therapist . Experimental subject also undergo 15 minute SKBRS exercise standard vestibular rehabilitation session . This device use video-based exercise non-invasive vibrotactile belt measure subject 's position space trunk tilt/sway perform various balance task . All subject undergo follow 3 routine test throughout course therapy determine progress : The Balance Error Scoring System ( BESS ) measure subject 's static balance , Clinical Test Sensory Integration Balance ( CTSIB ) , office-based version computerize dynamic postuography test , Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) , measure dynamic balance . Finally , investigator ask subject provide subjective opinion vestibular rehabilitation program opinion SKBRS filling questionnaire . The primary outcome measure comparison relative balance improvement subject underwent standard vestibular rehabilitation exercise underwent additional therapy SKBRS rehab session . This progress measure degree change BESS , CTSIB , DGI score subject ' first final vestibular rehabilitation session . The secondary outcome subject ' subjective assessment effectiveness vestibular rehabilitation ( measure VRBQ ) well experimental subject ' feedback SKBRS device ( measure SKBRS feedback survey ) .</detailed_description>
