	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Patients diagnose operable cancer upper gastro-intestinal ( GI ) tract undergo serious therapeutic procedure include invasive surgery combine chemo- chemo-radio therapy ( neo-adjuvant ) and/or ( adjuvant ) surgery . Despite recent advance , especially surgical technique patient care follow-up , population face one bad prognosis patient operable staged disease , 5-year relative survival 35-40 % . The possibility long-term survival positive surgical outcome , include surgical principle perform wide clearance , achieve negative margin ( R0 resection ) , perform radical lymphadenectomy . To end , considerable effort make recent year optimize perioperative period order provide patient surgeon best possible chance achieve surgical outcome . Adenocarcinoma gastro-esophageal junction ( GEJ ) increase incidence last quarter century . For patient present localized disease , advance standard care emerge recent year improve disease management . Firstly , comprehensive staging Computed Tomography ( CT ) , endoscopic ultrasound , diagnostic laparoscopy fluoro deoxy glucose position emission tomography ( 18FDG-PET ) permit exclusion patient curative therapy might previously schedule resection . Secondly , evidence support esophagectomy perform high-volume hospital high-volume surgeon . Finally , standard neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy perform center patient localized esophageal adenocarcinoma improve short- long-term cancer outcome . Prognostic role Muscle Function upper GI cancer For upper GI cancer , include GEJ , perioperative course therapy associate severe deconditioning include weight loss poor physical function . Over last decade , strong observational evidence emerge support poor pre-surgical muscle function , define either low muscle mass/area ( sarcopenia ) low functional strength , strong independent predictor post-surgical outcome include mortality , surgical complication chemotherapy dose-reduction . Importantly , strong evidence across different malignancy show prognostic value muscle function independent body mass , may actually under-reported due sarcopenic obesity . Thus , current available therapeutic countermeasure clinical practice , exclusively involve nutritional intervention , may limit potential ameliorate progressive muscle dysfunction perioperative treatment GEJ cancer . Exercise-Oncology Upper GI cancer Epidemiological evidence across heterogeneous homogeneous group cancer patient show low physical activity level diagnosis associate poor disease-specific overall survival . Despite general emerge interest , limited attention dedicate exploration safety , feasibility efficacy structure exercise intervention patient upper GI cancer . However , data recent study suggest unmet potential physical exercise patient , particular emphasis pre-surgical period . STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective â€¢ To explore safety feasibility structure exercise pre- post-operative phase among patient undergo treatment operable GEJ cancer Secondary objective : - To explore effect perioperative exercise training clinical ( e.g . clindo-davien score , pneumonia , anastomotic leakage ) physiological ( e.g . muscle strength , physical function ) psycho-social ( e.g . fatigue , emotional well-being , anxiety ) endpoint relative usual care . - To explore prognostic role pathophysiological profile ( physical function , pulmonary function , body-composition ) post-surgical complication Explorative objective : - To explore molecular adaptation metabolism physiology tumor , muscle fat sample take neo-adjuvant chemotherapy pre-operative phase ( sub-group ) patient allocate exercise train usual care - To explore acute response immune cell , hormone cytokine blood sample take , single exercise session - Collection blood tissue sample storage bio-bank future research . STUDY DESIGN This prospective , regional-based case-controlled feasibility trial include minimum 40 patient , include 20 training intervention-cases resident great Copenhagen Area , 20 usual care control live outside great Copenhagen area . Recruitment : Patients recruit department surgical gastroenterology , Rigshospitalet , follow multidisciplinary medical conference . The responsible physician provide oral information present patient write information study . Patients willing participate sign inform consent , study relate procedure perform . After sign informed consent , patient schedule baseline assessment allocate base geographical location ( home-town municipality ) , one two experimental arm : I ) Patient reside OUTSIDE Copenhagen area , allocate usual care observation group , include nurse-based follow procedure information life style factor ( diet , smoke cessation , alcohol , physical activity ) . II ) Patients reside WITHIN Copenhagen area , allocate usual care plus hospital-based aerobic resistance training Centre Physical Activity Research , Rigshospitalet Procedures involve assessment-measures conduct total 5 time study period : twice prior surgery ( baseline pre-surgery test ) , twice post-surgery ( 3 week post- 15 week post-surgery ) 1-year follow-up . The following assessment perform : 1 . Body composition Bioelectrical Impedance 2 . Fasting blood sample analyse plasma biochemistry ( cholesterol , triglyceride , inflammatory marker , HbA1C ) 3 . Health related Quality Life questionnaires 4 . Physical function : Handgrip strength sit-to-stand test . 5 . Forced Expiration Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) 6 . Biological tissue sampling ( OPTIONAL ) : tumor , muscle fat biopsy blood sample - baseline pre-surgery . 7 . Acute Exercise Response ( OPTIONAL ) ; blood sample take single exercise session . ANALYTIC PLAN As feasibility study , trial explorative nature perform primarily order determine whether appropriate advance large scale randomize control trial . Primary aim Safety feasibility perioperative exercise training patient operable GEJ cancer In order evaluate safety feasibility pre- post-surgical exercise patient operable cancer gastro-esophageal junction , incidence serious adverse event group determine , adherence exercise , assess number training session complete train group . Secondary aim Efficacy perioperative exercise training improve clinical , physiological psycho-social outcome patient operable GEJ cancer . In order determine whether exercise training capacity improve study outcome intragroup change , inter-group difference study outcomes calculate . For purpose random effect analysis perform repeated measure study outcomes dependent variable , covariates `` group '' , `` time '' interaction fix effect , random effect `` patient '' , adjust baseline-score , chemotherapy regimen , surgical procedure ( conventional v laparoscopic ) . Prognostic role pathophysiological profile patient operable GEJ cancer In order explore prognostic role study assessment outcome key clinical endpoint : post-surgical complication , hospital stay duration disease free overall mortality risk first year surgery , general linear regression model clinical endpoint dependent variable , study assessment outcome independent variable adjust baseline-score , chemotherapy regimen , surgical procedure ( conventional v laparoscopic ) . For variable ( physical function , pulmonary function , body-composition ) , predictive value : I ) diagnostic level ( prior neo-adjuvant therapy ) , II ) pre-surgical level ( neo-adjuvant treatment ) III ) change score diagnostic pre-surgical level ( neo-adjuvant therapy ) determine . Dropouts Missing Observations Patients wish drop-out study intervention-periods offer remain study regard test-assessments . Patients drop prior 'visit 2 ' replace . For between-group analysis , drop-outs miss observation handle `` missing random '' principle .
