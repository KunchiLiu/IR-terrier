	<brief_title>Evaluation Cochlear Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor Baha Attract System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cochlear Baha bone conduction hear implant offer two alternative way transmit vibration external sound processor osseointegrated implant : The Baha Connect System use skin-penetrating abutment allow direct bone conduction . The Baha Attract System use magnetic connection intact skin . Magnetic bone conduction hear implant advantage skin-penetrating system eliminate daily clean site perceive cosmetically appeal subject . With modern sound processor technology , possible obtain good sound transmission despite soft tissue attenuation inherent magnetic bone conduction hearing implant . Clinical investigation show Baha Attract System , use combination exist head-worn sound processor within Premium ( e.g . BP100 , Baha 4 Sound Processors ) Power ( BP110 Sound processor ) segment , provide good hearing outcome subject conductive mild mixed hearing loss . The Cochlear Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor first head-worn sound processor within Super Power segment fitting range 65 dBHL . It CE mark intend subject mixed hearing loss single-sided sensorineural deafness ( SSD ) . It use Baha Connect Baha Attract Systems Baha Softband . When used combination Baha Attract System , able compensate large sensorineural component current Premium Power sound processor , hence , allow subject benefit Baha Attract System . The combination Baha Attract System Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor powerful non-skin penetrate bone conduction hear implant solution available today . The Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor include discreet design , advance signal processing improve connectivity external sound source . The new sound processor support Cochlear 's 2.4 GHz wireless protocol programmable new version Baha 5 Fitting Software . The aim clinical investigation evaluate objective subjective hearing performance Cochlear Baha 5 SuperPower Sound Processor Baha Attract System , compare unaided hearing performance . Comparison audiological test result sound processor Baha Softband also perform . Short term safety parameter collect .</detailed_description>
