	<brief_title>Efficacy Intra-Articular Injection Etanercept Moderate Severe Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Osteoarthritis ( osteoarthritis , OA ) common joint disease . It characterize recurrent joint pain , swell , increase disease status , joint deformity activity disorder . [ 1 ] The pathogenesis OA fully understood . It may associate variety factor , : mechanic , biochemistry , genetics , . Its main feature imbalance synthesis catabolism articular cartilage cell . The imbalance may refer cell age , cell apoptosis , local inflammatory factor joint well stress mechanism . [ 2 ] OA usually develop burden active joint , : knee , spine ( cervical lumbar spine ) , hip ankle , hand joint , etc . The first session The National Health Nutrition Survey ( The first National Health Nutrition Examination Survey , NHANESI ) find 12 % people The United States least one joint accordance clinical diagnosis OA . [ 3 ] Radiographic result show rate American adult knee OA prevalence 14 % 37 % , woman common ( 4-6 ) . A large study find least one joint people 55 year radiographic hand OA , female prevalence 67 % , male 55 % [ 7 ] . The OA Chinese likely happen elder woman men . Prevalence rate could 50 % people age 60 , 80 % 75 year old . Osteoarthritis patient suffer huge pain , cause huge economic burden society , become serious impact social productivity lead huge economic burden [ 8 ] . In United States , OA cost $ 1,855 billion per year 27 million patient , woman spend $ 6212 per year , male $ 4730 per year [ 2 ] ; OA cost 1 % ~ 2.5 % gross domestic product ( GDP ) United States , Britain , France , Canada , Australia develop country . There burden economic data OA China [ 9 ] . Classification criterion knee osteoarthritis According affected area , OA divide knee OA , hip OA , hand OA ( distal interphalangeal joint , first wrist palm joint ) , foot OA ( first plantar toe joint , heel ) , etc . Knee OA common disease clinical disease . The classification knees OA contain clinical criterion , also clinical image criterion modify American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) classification criterion osteoarthritis classification criterion [ 10 ] . Knee osteoarthritis usually occur obvious fricative , bony enlargement , Baker cyst expansion joint effusion generally associate skin redness . The common deformity come varus severe case , also may appear early mild disease . That clinically obvious varus may predictive factor disease progression [ 11 ] . That quadriceps become weak changeable risk factor early knee OA disease progression , especially woman ( 12-13 ) . Muscle atrophy occur late stage disease progression [ 14 ] [ 15 ] . And bring huge burden disease patient . Treatment knee OA The aim treatment relieve pain , prevent delay progress disease , protect joint function , improve quality life . The treatment individualize . Full consideration patient ' illness risk factor give , include : joint structure changing , degree inflammation pain , concurrent disease status specific situation condition . Treatment give priority combine non-drug therapy drug therapy . Operation perform necessary [ 16 ] . Non-drug therapy include psychosocial intervention [ 16 ] , decrease weight [ 17 ] , reasonable exercise [ 18 ] , physical therapy include heat therapy , spa therapy , etc . ) , etc . Drug therapy mainly include drug use external , drug use whole body drug intra-articular injection [ 16 ] . Topical drug include : capsaicin [ 19 ] , non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) external use [ 20 ] lidocaine external use . Systemic medicine include : : non-opiate drug . Acetaminophen first choice OA treatment , main reason less side effect good curative effect [ 21 ] .b : NSAIDS . There two effect NSAIDS : anti-pain anti-inflammatory , commonly use control OA symptom . The main adverse reaction gastrointestinal symptom , renal liver damage , effect platelet function , may increase risk cardiovascular adverse event [ 22 ] . c : opioid analgesic . It consider Pain still difficult control non-drug drug treatment . Drugs injection intra-articular , include : intra-articular injection glucocorticoid hyaluronic acid derivative [ 23 ] . Research TNF-α application OA : TNF-α IL1 play important role pathogenesis osteoarthritis , IL1 - beta often express highly middle late course OA [ 24 27 ] . In OA flare course , TNF-α IL1 alpha increase significantly ; TNF-α consider one important factor associate degree OA inflammatory , IL1 alpha significant relation start OA inflammatory [ 27 ] . 2 . Aims : Primary : evaluate efficacy intra-articular injection etanercept moderate severe knee osteoarthritis Second : investigate potentiality serum cytokine ( TNF-α , L1-α , IL1-β , MMP1 , MMP13 ) predict response intra-articular injection etanercept moderate severe knee osteoarthritis . 3 . Patients : Recruit Patients moderate severe knee osteoarthritis , totally 60 patient ( According classification `` Clinical Image '' 1986 American college rheumatology criterion osteoarthritis knee ) 4 . Study Design : A 12-week , multi-center , open-labeled , randomize study . Moderately severe knee osteoarthritis patient , total 60 patient ( consider expulsion rate 15 % ) ( According classification `` Clinical Image '' 1986 American college rheumatology criterion osteoarthritis knee ) The 60 patient randomly assign two group : Etanercept treatment group : Intra-articular injection etanercept 25mg/w/joint health education , exercise diet guidance ; treatment : 5 week Routine care group : Health education , exercise diet guidance ; treatment : 5 week ( If knee involve , significant symptomatic side choose injection etanercept ) This study two stage : 1 . Screening/baseline period : - 4 week ~ 0 week ; Patients sign informed consent form ( ICF ) participate study Obtain history treatment , medical record , disease history demographic information patient . And also perform pregnancy test ( optional ) , HIV test ( optional ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) detection ( optional ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) detection ( optional ) , electrocardiogram examination , chest radiograph , tuberculin test ( PPD ) test , vital sign , physical examination , blood routine , urine routine blood biochemical examination , image examination ( anteroposterior/lateral X-ray knee joint , horizontal position/lateral projection/side lateral projection ultrasound knee , supine position knee joint MRI ( optional , sagittal coronary commonly use ) , measure erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) C reactive protein ( CRP ) store serum - 80 ℃ detect serum protein marker level baseline period , time , keep plasma - 80 ℃ . ( refer `` 9.3 lab operation '' ) . Collect disease assessment result baseline , record Visual Analog Pain Scale ( VAS ) pain score , MOS 12-item Short Form Health Survey ( SF12 ) score , knee injury osteoarthritis score ( KOOS score ) , 30 - Chair Stand Test ( CST ) score , 40 Fast-paced Walk Test ( FPWT ) score , ultrasonic relative index score MRI relative index score . 2 . Follow-up : baseline 12 week , period , two group participant treat Intra-articular injection etanercept 25 mg/w/joint , health education , exercise diet guidance health education , exercise diet guidance separately . During period 4 time follow-up perform 2nd , 4th , 8th , 12th week . At 2nd week , vital sign record , pain VAS score , SF12 score , KOOS score , condition drug combination adverse event record . At 4th week , vital sign record , blood routine , urine routine , blood biochemical , ESR CRP examine record , image examination ( horizontal position/lateral projection/side lateral projection ultrasound knee ) , collect basic evaluation result : pain VAS score , SF12 score , KOOS score , 30 - CST score , 40 FPWT score , ultrasonic relative index score condition drug combination adverse event record . At 8th week , 12th week , vital sign , blood routine , urine routine blood biochemical examine record image examination perform ( horizontal position/lateral projection/side lateral projection ultrasound knee supine position MRI knee joint , ( optional , sagittal coronary use usual ) ) . Measure ESR CRP store serum - 80 ℃ detect serum protein marker level baseline 8th week 12th week , time , store plasma - 80 ℃ . ( refer `` 9.3 lab operation '' ) . Collect disease assessment result , record pain VAS score , SF12 score , KOOS score , 30 - CST score , 40 FPWT score , ultrasonic index score MRI relative index score ( optional ) .
