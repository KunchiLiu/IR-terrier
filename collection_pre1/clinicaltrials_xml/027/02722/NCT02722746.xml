	<brief_summary>Epidural analgesia via continuous epidurally infused local anesthetic agent ( LA ) widely successfully use routinely perioperative pain control patient undergo major orthopedic abdominal surgery since 1928 . The choice currently depend preference APS physician charge case . A frequent unwanted side effect epidural block hypotension due epidurally injected LA block sympathetic nerve thus patient 's response hypotension , usually due hypovolemia and/or unopposed parasympathetic ( via vagus nerve ) nervous system . The purpose research study see add epinephrine , epidural anesthetic decrease possible side effect , low blood pressure , lead well effect epidural anesthetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants undergo epidural analgesia treat perioperative pain associate major surgery approach willingness participate study . Participants undergo major thoracic , abdominal , orthopaedic surgery thoracic lumbar epidural block would indicate planned intraoperative postoperative analgesia per University Florida Acute Pain Service ( APS ) usual routine practice include study . All participant receive standardize continuous epidural block appropriate level plan surgery APS physicians block room day . For standardized continuous epidural block , placement confirm loss resistance technique ( LORA ) , wave form analysis nerve stimulation . Participants randomly allocate computer-generated randomization one four group . This quintuple blind prospective study . The anesthesiologist manage intraoperative anesthesia , anesthesiologist ( APS ) place block follow participant floor , research nurse take measurement , surgeon , participant aware combination drug use epidural block infusion . The three group consist : 1 . Group A ( Ropivacaine 0.2 % infusion ; Control group ) 2 . Group B ( Ropivacaine 0.2 % + 2 mcg/mL epinephrine ) 3 . Group C ( Ropivacaine 0.2 % + 5 mcg/mL epinephrine )</detailed_description>
