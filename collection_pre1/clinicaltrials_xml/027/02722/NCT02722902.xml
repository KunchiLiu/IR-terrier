	<detailed_description>Rationale : Insulin resistant subject type 2 diabetic patient characterize decreased metabolic flexibility : reduce capability switch fat oxidation basal state carbohydrate oxidation insulin-stimulated state . This metabolic inflexibility early hallmark development diabetes . Recent evidence suggest low carnitine availability may limit acetylcarnitine formation , thereby reduce metabolic flexibility . Thus , substrate flux muscle high , acetyl-CoA concentration increase , lead inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) thereby reduce glucose oxidation . The conversion acetyl-CoA acetylcarnitine relieve acetyl-CoA pressure PDH . To provide direct insight effect carnitine prevent metabolic inflexibility insulin resistance explore mechanism action focus research . Here , hypothesize capacity form acetylcarnitine may rescue lipid-induced insulin resistance . To end , insulin resistance induce lipid infusion healthy volunteer test whether carnitine co-infusion alleviate insulin resistance . Objective : The primary objective investigate whether L-carnitine infusion may rescue lipid-induced insulin resistance whether L-carnitine infusion improve metabolic flexibility state lipid-induced insulin resistance . Furthermore , secondary objective examine molecular pathway carnitine acetylcarnitine , responsible muscle insulin sensitivity . Study design : The current study interventional randomize crossover trial subject serve own control . Subjects blind intervention . Study population : n=10 , healthy young ( 18-40 year ) male subject include . Intervention ( applicable ) : Ten healthy subject subject intervention L-carnitine infusion . To investigate whether L-Carnitine infusion may rescue lipid induced insulin resistance improve metabolic flexibility three intervention trial include . The first trial include lipid infusion combine L-Carnitine infusion ( =LIPID + CAR ) . In second trial , L-carnitine infusion replace placebo infusion form saline ( = LIPID + PLAC ) order investigate effect L-Carnitine . During third trial , lipid infusion replace infusion saline serve control lipid infusion ( =SALINE + PLAC ) necessary investigate extend L-carnitine rescue lipid induce insulin resistance . All three trial separate least one week . Subjects blind , information infuse substance provide . The three different trial allocate random order . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary study endpoint whole body insulin sensitivity , measure hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp . Secondary endpoint maximal acetylcarnitine concentration exercise , metabolic compound blood measurement regard skeletal muscle metabolism skeletal muscle tissue obtain needle biopsy .</detailed_description>
