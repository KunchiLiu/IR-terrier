	<brief_summary>The guideline-recommended standard care patient experience heart attack , heart failure , coronary event procedure exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) . Despite proven benefit , traditional CR severely underutilized . Moreover , typically lack traditional CR program effective psychosocial risk management . This represent critical gap care give well-documented psychosocial need patient population.The objective feasibility study conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) versus usual care CR-eligible cardiac patient . Randomization stratify within two stratum base participation CR ( yes/no ) among CR-eligible patient . The primary goal pilot study : 1 ) obtain estimate treatment effect variability ; 2 ) evaluate recruitment retention strategy ; 3 ) examine safety MBSR protocol CR-eligible patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The objective feasibility study conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) versus usual care CR-eligible cardiac patient . Randomization stratify within two stratum base participation CR ( yes/no ) among CR-eligible patient . The primary goal pilot study : 1 ) obtain estimate treatment effect variability ; 2 ) evaluate recruitment retention strategy ; 3 ) examine safety MBSR protocol CR-eligible patient . Design Outcomes : The study design randomize controlled trial randomization two stratum . The primary outcome change ( improvement ) heart rate variability ( HRV ) assess 24-hour Holter monitor worn patient three time throughout study ( pre- post-intervention 9-month follow-up ) . Both time domain ( SDNN RMSSD ) frequency domain ( Total power , Low Frequency power , High Frequency power ) variable assess . HRV well-established method assess autonomic nervous system . Secondary outcome include change stress , depression , anxiety , quality life , physical functioning cardiovascular risk factor . All participant undergo baseline assessment , follow randomization treatment control condition , three follow-up assessment , 3 , 6 , 9 month randomization . The 3-month follow-up occur immediately post-intervention . The baseline , 3-month 9-month ( final ) follow-up assessment in-person include questionnaire stress emotion , quality life , short physical performance battery , blood draw ass lipid , high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein hemoglobin A1c well 24-hour Holter monitor ass HRV . The 6-month follow-up assessment telephone include brief assessment mood , stress , symptom . The investigator anticipate pilot study complete 18 month . Interventions Duration : Upon enrollment , participant randomize two group , intervention group ( MBSR ) control group ( MBSR ) . Randomization occur separately enrol CR enrol CR . For stratum attends CR , control condition consist CR usual care , whereas participant stratum attend CR , control condition consist usual care . All participant strata receive standard print material healthy lifestyle stress management . The intervention last 8 week occur within first 12 week ( 3 month ) randomization . The standard outpatient Phase II CR program offer within Fairview Hospital system traditional exercise-based program include intake visit 24 1-hour monitor exercise session ( 1-3 time per week 8-24 week , individualized patient need therapy goal ) 8 9 1-hour educational session . Patients participate CR randomize intervention group participate standard outpatient Phase II CR individual randomize control condition within stratum , plus 8-week MBSR course . The MBSR course taught per standard protocol group set consists eight 2.5-hour weekly session one 6.5-hour retreat ; MBSR course lead trained facilitator University Minnesota Center Spirituality Healing . Sample Size Population : The targeted enrollment 72 participant , 36 randomized participate MBSR across two stratum 36 randomize control condition ( MBSR ) receive usual care ( include CR opt enroll CR ) . The investigator recruit CR-eligible cardiac patient three site within Fairview Hospital system offer CR ( Ridges Burnsville , Southdale Edina , University Minnesota Riverside Campus Minneapolis ) , well electronic health record , clinic visit health care provider , advertisement flyer locate clinic CR location , inclusion study www.studyfinder.umn.edu .</detailed_description>
