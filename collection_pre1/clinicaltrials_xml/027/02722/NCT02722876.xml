	<brief_title>The Efficacy Rehabilitation Exercise Non-operative Limb Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol : 44 eligible consent patient ( allow 20 % attrition ) unilateral anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injury elect undergo surgical reconstruction recruit study . Patients randomly assign one two different condition : 1 ) standard ACL rehabilitation plus 8-weeks contralateral muscle resistance training , [ INTERVENTION ] ; 2 ) standard ACL rehabilitation plus placebo exercise ( time-matched unrelated upper limb flexibility exercise , [ CONTROL ] . Assessments knee extensor knee flexor neuromuscular performance limb obtain prior , 8-weeks post- 6-months post- surgery . Assessments function ( 1-leg hop distance ) patient-reported outcome ( International Knee Documentation Committee [ IKDC ] ) also conduct time . Further , patient ask wear tri-axial accelerometer gain objective measure habitual physical activity ( PA ) sedentary time pattern one week pre-surgery ( 5 weekday 2 weekend day ) , first final week INTERVENTION/CONTROL 6 month post- INTERVENTION/CONTROL . The initial assessment 8-weeks post-surgery evaluate efficacy contralateral training programme , specifically whether train intervention non-injured leg elicit change performance injure leg compare control group . The assessment 6-months post-surgery evaluate carry-over effect contralateral training programme , specifically whether change performance injure leg retain 6-months post-surgery compare control group . 6-months post-surgery currently early opportunity would permit patient return sport activity . ACL surgery perform three surgeon RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital throughout study accord standardise technique procedure . Sample size data analysis : The mean standard deviation primary outcome measure ( peak strength ) correlation coefficient baseline strength 8-weeks strength , need calculate sample size , base previously accrue data laboratory similar cohort ACL patient . Assuming trial power detect difference group 50N ( 12.5 % peak strength ) 80 % two-sided p=0.05 significance level , trial require 18 patient group assume analysis ANCOVA ( Analysis Covariance ; see formula Borm et al. , 2007 ) . Based drop-out rate 20 % , trial require sample size 22 patient per trial arm ( 44 patient total ) . Patient recruitment Potential participant identify record patient list ACL surgery out-patient clinic . They approach member clinical trial team ( consultant , registrar , physiotherapist , lead researcher ) . The study information design explain patient meet inclusion criterion interested . They give patient information leaflet inform consent form take away . These patient contact phone physiotherapist lead researcher least 24-hours later ascertain verbal consent study arrange appointment initial assessment . Patients opportunity ask question study stage also . Written inform consent obtain first appointment , prior initial assessment . Once consent study , patient assign number . A master copy individual ' unique identification number data hold password-protected computer , store locked cabinet , lock NHS research office . Data monitoring : Scheduled monthly meeting research team enable monitoring study progress . Quarterly meeting RJAH data monitoring group provide independent monitoring study . No adverse advent expect , however , ant record on-site file report immediately data monitoring group .</detailed_description>
