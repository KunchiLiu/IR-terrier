	<detailed_description>Immunotherapy Brain Tumors : Although usually ineffective alone , long recognize immune system tumor bearing host ( human animal model ) , indeed , mount endogenous immune-mediated response tumor . Unfortunately , immune response alone sufficient combat tumor . The balance immune response immune regulation often mitigate anti-tumor response . Several mechanism within tumor-bearing host compromise efficacy anti-tumor immune response , include low level expression co-stimulatory molecule B7 family immune-regulatory ligand , tumor 's local production immunosuppressive factor tumor 's ability over-express pro-survival factor thus escape destruction host immune system . However , many hypothesize immune response well harness and/or magnify , potential heighten tumor response . A number specific observation support use immunotherapy treat brain tumor . Data publish support possible correlation HIV mediate immunosuppression development intracranial glial tumor . Immunosuppression transplant recipient also implicate development intracranial glioma . Further support hypothesis document rare case long-term remission malignant brain tumor follow significant post-operative infection . These observation fuel idea heighten immune system may confer protection intracranial tumor . With mind , one hypothesis successful active immunotherapy patient brain tumor require development specific peptide polyvalent vaccine effort stimulate host 's immune system specific tumor-associated antigen . It well establish mouse immunize syngeneic tumor . Heat shock protein-peptide complex isolate specific tumor utilized elicit prophylactic therapeutic immunity specific cancer preparation isolate . Overexpression heat shock protein-chaperone complex ( HSPPC ) brain tumor cell suggest HSPPC meaningful target antigen brain tumor vaccine . Moreover , addition generate tumor-specific immunity , vaccination heat shock protein peptide complex animal model generate therapeutic response . Since immune response widely evaluate pediatric brain tumor , study test safety feasibility produce administer vaccine capable generate autologous , anti-tumor immune response . HSPPC-96 : Heat shock proteins up-regulated along tissue-specific chaperone peptide set cellular stress prevent damage aggregation proteome . Therefore , heat shock protein peptide complex ( HSPPC ) provide cytoprotective effect . Overexpression heat shock protein describe malignant glioma medulloblastoma cell . HSPPC-96 autologous tumor-derived vaccine clinical investigation treatment variety cancer type , include adult high-grade glioma ( HGG ) . It compose 96-kilodalton ( KDa ) heat shock protein , glycoprotein 96 ( gp96 ) , attach autologous tumor-derived peptide . The gp96 glycoprotein HSPPC-96 highly conserve , abundant , non-polymorphic stress protein find every cell type body . Gp96 isolate normal tumor tissue find complex peptide specific original tissue . Mouse model show HSPPC-96 confers protective immunity tumor derive genetically distinct tumor normal tissue . When injected host , HSPPC-96 interact antigen present cell ( APCs ) via specific receptor . Once internalized APCs , peptide chaperon HSP transfer major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I class II molecules intracellular compartment eventually express cell surface . T-cells recognize MHC-peptide complex stimulate . HSP-peptide complexes unique ability elicit antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell response . Additionally , cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) T cell natural killer ( NK ) cell also recruit add tumor-associated immunity . Some advantage heat shock protein-peptide vaccine immunotherapy elicits cluster differentiation ( CD8+ ) T cell response spite exogenous administration , circumvents need identification T-cell epitope individual cancer , minimize possibility generate epitope variant . Furthermore , heat shock protein-peptide complex elicit tumor rejection CD8+ T cell response without adjuvant therapy . Heat shock protein-peptide complex , HSPPC-96 , isolate human tumor , inject back patient isolate , may present unique opportunity deliver vaccine specific patient .</detailed_description>
