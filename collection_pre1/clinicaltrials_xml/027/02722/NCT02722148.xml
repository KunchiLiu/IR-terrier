	<detailed_description>This prospective single center clinical trial allergen-specific immune signature-guided dietary elimination therapy assess clinical effectiveness technique . Potential subject approach regard study . If eligible interested , informed consent obtain enrol study . If subject esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) UNC 3 month since enrollment , clinical biopsy EGD show active EoE subject continue meet consensus guideline active EoE , research biopsy take EGD use study , subject complete questionnaire blood draw . The blood draw may abbreviate subject research blood drawn recent EGD use study . If subject EGD biopsy UNC within 3 month prior enrollment , complete questionnaire , blood draw , schedule receive routine care esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) UNC facility clinical research biopsy . However , case , sample obtain prior time frame use , long sample obtain EoE active major change clinical status . During routine care endoscopy , clinical biopsy take routine care purpose , additional research biopsy collect research purpose diet elimination test stored future research study distal , mid , proximal esophagus . Blood also collect visit , questionnaire complete . If research biopsy unable obtain EGD subject long continue study consider screen fail . If pathology routine care biopsy confirm diagnosis active EoE , subject long continue study consider screen fail . If subject EGD clinical research biopsy within 3 month prior enrollment , research biopsy take EGD use study . As noted , case , sample obtain prior time frame use , long sample obtain EoE active major change clinical status . After completion EGD ( collection EGD record previous biopsy EGD previously complete ) , confirmation eligibility , subject schedule routine care nutrition counsel appointment . Two week prior routine care nutrition counsel appointment , subject begin dysphagia symptom questionnaire ( DSQ ) . During routine care nutrition counsel appointment , subject receive counsel food eliminate base novel assay result research biopsy . Subjects also receive allergy skin test visit . Results allergy skin test use drive food elimination diet . Subjects follow assign food elimination diet 6 week . At 6 week subject schedule routine care esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) biopsies clinical purpose . Two week prior 6 week EGD subject restart DSQ . Data collect 6 week EGD research specific biopsy sample obtain visit . Study participation complete completion 6 week EGD .</detailed_description>
