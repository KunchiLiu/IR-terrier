	<brief_summary>'Spinal lipoma ' condition , present birth , fatty tissue ( lipoma ) attach low end spinal cord , tether within vertebral canal . The cord normally move respiration , whereas tether prevents movement , lead progressive neurological deterioration . The cord spinal nerve become stretched blood supply damage irreversibly . Disability may include weakness pain low body , urinary disorder young child . Treatment surgical , remove lipoma mobilise spinal cord , 60 operation perform per year Great Ormond Street Hospital . This project aim develop lipidomic biomarkers order predict child spinal lipoma high risk neurological deterioration , require early surgery , provide evidence adopt conservative approach low risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Biomarker Monitoring Clinical Outcomes Children With Spinal Lipoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical study seek metabolic biomarker ( ) , detectable mass spectrometry , use 'stratify ' patient asymptomatic lipoma . In view often extensive nature lipoma associate low spinal cord , hypothesise lipid component , metabolite derive , may gain entry child 's bloodstream . The infiltrative lipoma carry high risk symptomatic deterioration , argue , also high chance generate lipid 'signature ' blood and/or urine . Phase 1 ‐ Cerebrospinal fluid , blood urine sample obtain patient spinal lipoma undergo surgery ( n = 3 5 ) . Informed consent , follow appropriate ethic committee approval , implement . Blood urine sample pre‐operatively , intra‐operative cerebrospinal fluid sample obtain . Mass spectrometry analysis identify lipid specie present cerebrospinal fluid patient , extent also detectable patient 's blood and/or urine . Any lipid specie detect cerebrospinal fluid blood/urine represent potential biomarkers , form focus next phase study . Phase 2 ass discriminatory value potential biomarkers compare profile blood and/or urine three clinical group : ( ) Patients spinal lipomas neurological symptoms/signs , attend hospital surgery ( i.e . similar patient Phase 1 ) . Blood/urine sample take preoperatively , represent 'high risk ' group . ( ii ) Patients spinal lipoma remain asymptomatic several year follow‐up . These represent 'low risk ' group ; ( iii ) Patients spinal condition involve lipoma . These represent 'negative ' control group . Group size determined power calculation use variance data patient measurement Phase 1 . Statistical analysis 1‐way ANOVA , non‐parametric equivalent , test significant difference three group . Mass spectrometry ( Figure 2 ) perform Institute Child Health Centre Proteomics , Metabolomics Lipidomics use nano ultra performance liquid chromatography ultra performance convergence chromatography - quadrupole time flight mass spectrometry , new mass spectral technology lipidomic metabolomic analysis . Ultra performance convergence chromatography chromatography technology use carbon dioxide present super critical fluid state mobile phase allow fractionation metabolite lipids accord class hydrophobicity . It enable quantitation major lipid class present tissue include phospholipid , free fatty acid , esterify fatty acid , cholesterol ester sterols . Non‐lipid molecule ( e.g . choline ) might also show altered abundance lipoma patient general metabolomics analysis also undertaken , time permit .</detailed_description>
