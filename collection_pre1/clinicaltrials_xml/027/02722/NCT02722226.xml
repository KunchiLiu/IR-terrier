	<detailed_description>Sedation drug depression consciousness alertness . It involve intravenous hypnotic narcotic administration . Depending dos blood level administer agent , continuum anxiolysis , light sedation ( monitor anesthesia care ) , deep sedation general anesthesia . Sedation use facilitate diagnostic examination , minor surgery , endoscopic surgery endovascular transcutaneous therapeutic radiological procedure . It provide comfort patient procedure well condition examination treatment operator . The main risk procedural sedation compromise patient 's respiratory function airway . The obstruction upper airway tongue , soft palate epiglottis one hand respiratory depression due sedative hand major problem sedation . In addition respiratory depression , decrease airway protective reflex sedation expose gastric content aspiration consequent respiratory complication . Major complication rare : one case death 160,000 , 1 case tracheal intubation 58 000 case permanent neurologic damage 646,000 gastrointestinal endoscopy perform sedation . More common , incidence partial obstruction require airway maneuver release ( mandibular subluxation , oropharyngeal airway device , nasopharyngeal airway device ) 14.4 % , 12.8 % hypoxemia , 0.1 % ventilation face mask 0.6 % ongoing procedure need stop . Although incident without clinical severity , cause serious complication diagnose late inadequate care . Various analyzes American Society Anesthesiology claim relate sedation , prove seriousness complication importance early management , 40 % claim involve death hypoxic permanent brain injury could prevent 50 % claim relate anesthetic procedure perform outside operating room . Respiratory depression associate absolute relative overdose sedative primary mechanism complication . Sedation practice non-anesthesiologists . There several publication , anesthesiology field , sedation regime use safety efficacy . The heterogeneity definition respiratory complication lack power study fail show reduction respiratory complication safety sedation accord standard anesthesiologist . The complication associate limited knowledge anesthetic drug pharmacology , monitor sedation airway management . The anesthesiologist play central role establish safe sedation standard administer non-anesthesiologists . In addition sedation learn need , majority resident non-anesthesiologists sedation practitioner , strongly express interest learn sedation . This interest relate resident ' discomfort use sedation associate lack master sedative pharmacology airway management principle . The simulation teach tool increasingly use . The literature show simulation improve performance trainee various technical non technical skill ( expertise , crisis resource management principle ) . Simulation use assessment tool education technique . It assess performance trainee reproducible situation . Simulation base medical education success depend several factor . The relevance subject teach professional context , target population , identification educational goal , educational activity implement achieve objective , choice parameter measure measurement method factor strongly affect impact simulation base medical education . The recent meta-analysis McGraphie colleague review study , 1990 2011 , evaluate effectiveness simulation base medical education . It show simulation base medical education superiority traditional clinical education acquire limited design skill . The explanation simulation use base fact simulation seem fill gap traditional clinical learning , delayed random clinical exposure scarcity complication . The use simulation learn sedation non-anesthesiologists seem meet requirement dictate subject teach . It , indeed , allow sedative drug pharmacology learn technical skill master . It also allow , reproducible scenario , high-fidelity simulation , improvement overall complication ' sedation management assessment impact simulation base medical education . However , even simulation offer theoretical practical component safe sedation educational program , overall result education base simulation ability non-resident anesthesiologist manage sedation 's complication remain assessed . The aim randomize control trial evaluate impact high fidelity simulation base sedation learn non-anesthesiologists resident ' performance management sedation 's complication , simulate scenario . Methods 1 . Description simulation base sedation learn program The program 's goal offer comprehensive approach theory practice sedation . It must provide resident vision adapt daily practice . Being base simulation , education draw profile component provide education simulation tool . The simulation base sedation learn program consist different module response resident ' need practice sedation . The teaching base specific educational objective , experimental learning condition , repeat practice assessment base achievement rate task . These module develop anesthesiologist practice academic field practice sedation . The program include online learning . It follow development interactive presentation , base simulated case simulate patient ( actor ) , low fidelity simulation specific technical skill well high fidelity scenario complication related sedation . The purpose high-fidelity simulation enable resident integrate theoretical practical learning receive , similar context clinical practice , develop comprehensive contextual ( material , human resource authorize technique ) management sedation , prevent , anticipate , make early diagnosis adequate management simulate complication . 2 . Study Design This prospective , randomize , control , single-blind , trial . The study conduct University Montreal simulation centre . The robotic model use SimMan 3G ( Laerdal , Inc. http : / /www.laerdal.com/doc/85/SimMan-3G ) . The primary objective performance score simulation base sedation learn program high fidelity simulate scenario sedation 's complication manage non anesthesiologist resident . 3 . Population Included study , resident surgery program , radiology , gastroenterology , pneumology , family medicine , emergency medicine University Montreal . Residents must academic supervision 1 : 1 senior practice . Residents receive prior instruction sedation advance learn technical skill airway management residency exclude . The recruited participant randomize accord randomization table , computerize , establish prior inclusion intervention group receive simulation base sedation learn control group . 4 . Assessment method develop performance checklist The evaluation base list task behaviour ( technical non technical skill ) resident management simulated complication relate sedation . It include item relate specific management complication ( expertise ) non-specific item communication collaboration ( Crisis Resource Management principle ) . It divide ) initial assessment situation b ) diagnostic step c ) management ) secondary evaluation . The performance list develop validate use modify Delphi method . 5 . Procedure A description high-fidelity simulation perform , participation uncomplicated sedation scenario make initially two group . This first experience allow become familiar environment simulation use mannequin interface / physician . This simulation follow debrief . Participants randomize : Intervention group : Residents include group go following step : A simulation respiratory complication related sedation : Base line performance . The simulation base sedation program , describe . A second simulation respiratory complication related sedation : Post test . Assessments conduct independent instructor blindly . The evaluator attribute score view record performance , without know group candidate include , whether simulation base sedation program realize . Control group : Residents include group carry : A complication relate sedation simulation : Base line performance , follow debriefing . A self visualization video describe sedation adult . A second simulation , 2 month later : Post test For equity training , control group offer simulation base sedation program end study , desire . 6 . Analysis result The task classify 2 category : properly perform / properly perform . The performance score represent adequately perform task total number task ( primary outcome ) . Secondary outcome include comparison ( ) performance score pre-test post-test group ( b ) performance score relate technical skill ( c ) performance score relate non technical skill . The result compare analysis variance repeat measure . The difference performance simulation base sedation program compare use test . The number participant number eligible resident agree participate ( convenience sample ) . As select population study consist large sample , several residency program concern , investigator opt two group 25 participant ( total n 50 ) .</detailed_description>
