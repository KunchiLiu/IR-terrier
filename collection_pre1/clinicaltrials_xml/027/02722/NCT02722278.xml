	<brief_title>A Study Oral Testosterone Undecanoate ( TU ) Hypogonadal Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , Phase 3 , randomize , open-label , active-comparator group , efficacy ( base Cavg T ) , safety study adult hypogonadal male subject . Enrollment base criterion design select general population hypogonadal men . Study drug dos titrate use dose-titration algorithm base total T Cavg . Subjects may androgen treatment-naïve washed prior androgen replacement therapy . Subjects must 2 total T level &lt; 300 ng/dL base 2 blood sample obtain morning ( AM ) 2 separate day approximately 7 day apart . Approximately 180 subject randomly assign receive open-label treatment 3:1 ratio oral TU Axiron ( ie , approximately 135 subject randomly assign oral TU approximately 45 subject randomly assign Axiron topical solution ) . Subjects complete study receive 105 day treatment . Serial pharmacokinetics ( PK ) sample 24 hour obtain 21 , 56 105 day treatment . Dose titration base T Cavg day 21 56 treatment . A subset 30 subject participate cosyntropin stimulation test . Subjects receive injection cosyntropin Day 1 ( administration study drug ) Day 106 last 24-hour PK sample drawn . Cortisol assay collect immediately injection , well 30 60 minute injection .</detailed_description>
