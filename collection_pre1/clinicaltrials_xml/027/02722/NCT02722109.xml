	<brief_title>Dual Energy CT : A New Method Better Dose Calculation Proton Beam Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal study compare proton stop ratio , use proton beam therapy planning , calculate base single energy CT dual energy CT image . The calculation method proton stop power ratio differs two type CT image , researcher want investigate proton stop power ratio estimate accurately use dual energy CT. A accurate stop power ratio calculation give accurate proton range determination patient tissue , lead well knowledge dose distribution patient undergo cancer treatment proton beam irradiation . Knowing accurate dose distribution allow uncertainty margin reduction around tumor , result le normal tissue irradiate thereby risk side effect reduce without risk under-dosage tumor .</detailed_description>
