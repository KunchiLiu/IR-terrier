	<brief_summary>Objective : The investigator change health system improve care patient receive transition earlier stage kidney disease toward kidney failure . They study whether change lead patient ' improve health well-being . Methods : The investigator conduct study Geisinger Health System kidney specialty clinic . The study implement 'Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care ' ( 1 ) give doctor tool help recognize patient prepare kidney failure help support patient ' early inform treatment decision ; ( 2 ) add 'Kidney Transitions Specialist ' health care team help patient learn kidney disease , learn self-care skill , make informed decision , get psychosocial support , coordinate care . Four ( 4 ) clinic randomly assign provide Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care , four ( 4 ) provide usual care . The investigator study difference patient ' outcome among treated clinic provide Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care compare treat clinic provide usual care . Patient Outcomes : Patients tell u want 'control ' disease transition best quality life possible . The investigator measure patient ' empowerment , confidence self-care , decision start self-care treatment kidney failure , hospitalization . They also measure whether doctor record patient ' treatment preference medical record patient develop kidney failure . Patient Stakeholder Engagement : This study respond report hundred patient caregiver want good care . Patients caregiver around US part investigative team , participate aspect study . The investigator also engage key stakeholder kidney community , include patient , provider , payer , regulator . Anticipated Impact : If effective , Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care provide model care improve live patient family kidney disease across US .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Putting Patients Center Kidney Care Transitions ( PREPARE NOW )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance Chronic kidney disease affect 20 million US adult experience multifold excess morbidity mortality compare general public . Over 115,000 patient develop kidney failure year . For patient , disease often accompany unpredictable rapid rate kidney function decline later stage . Unpredictable decline kidney function commonly result poorly plan transition seemingly stable chronic disease management urgent emergent need kidney failure treatment . These sudden transition often medically psychologically traumatic patient . Without advance planning support , patient initiate dialysis emergently , unprepared undergo substantial life change disability associate treatment thrice-weekly hemodialysis . They also miss important early opportunity select treatment ( e.g. , self care dialysis home kidney transplant ) could align value improve health . Since difficult predict suddenly develop kidney failure , patient later stage CKD ( ) equip manage risk disease progression ( b ) learn treatment option kidney failure enough time understand plan possible treatment . Plans treatment , kidney transplant , complex , require multiple referral , diagnostic test , medical visit . The loss kidney function also , case , accompany cognitive decline emotional disturbance ( include denial , fear , depression ) . As result , patient need time assimilate information support help make informed decision , coordinate care , obtain psychosocial help . Health system support patient ' kidney disease transition often inadequate . As result , patient poor understanding kidney disease treatment , feel care patient center , 'blind-sided ' seemingly catastrophic initiation dialysis -- cause suffer receipt treatment n't want . Efficacious educational , psychosocial , care management intervention exist , implemented piecemeal fashion readily accessible . Health system infrastructure resource enable integrated delivery efficacious intervention may crucial miss link ensure patient ' support kidney failure improve health well-being . Study Aims The investigator seek improve health system ' capacity provide comprehensive care patient transition chronic kidney disease kidney failure . Specifically , : 1 . Establish Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care infrastructure ( ) prioritize kidney patient ' inform self-care treatment decision ( b ) support patient transition across kidney disease stag provide education , psychosocial support , biomedical preparation 2 . Study effectiveness new Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care infrastructure improve patient ' values-aligned kidney care , empowerment , well-being Study Description The investigator perform cluster randomize control trial among 8 nephrology clinic Geisinger Health System . Clinics provide nephrology care 2.6 million patient 44 rural suburban county eastern Pennsylvania . The study target adult ( age &gt; 18 year ) estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 increase risk disease progression . Practice population substantially rural moderate low education advance age . Practices serve 997 patient , anticipate 498 patient arm ( arm comprise 4 practice ) . In four clinic , investigator implement 'Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care ' . This intervention implement two major health system change , include ( 1 ) new electronic health information tool alert provider patient need kidney transition care help establish patient ' preference align care ; ( 2 ) add 'Kidney Transitions Specialist ' health care team plus resource support patient ' transition . Electronic health information tool include ( ) disease registry personalize risk prediction tool prompt physician patient need transition support prepare patient kidney failure time right , ( b ) modular computer application help patient enter value treatment preference health record help provider track care . The Kidney Transitions Specialist ( 1 ) facilitate patient ' education engage share decision-making patient caregiver ; ( 2 ) empower patient improve self-care behavioral training ; ( 3 ) engage peer professional social emotional support ; ( 4 ) navigate patient multi-step biomedical plan ; ( 5 ) advocate align patient ' care value . We compare outcomes clinic implement Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care outcomes four clinic proceed routine nephrology care , include health information tool change health care team program . Primary outcomes measure patient ' empowerment , self-efficacy self-care , decision start self-care treatment , hospitalization . The investigator also measure documentation patient ' preference electronic health record . These outcome choose patient tell u want feel 'control ' disease want best quality life possible . Long term , finding provide important information improve health well patient transition chronic kidney disease kidney failure . If effective , work provide model replicated health system across US .</detailed_description>
