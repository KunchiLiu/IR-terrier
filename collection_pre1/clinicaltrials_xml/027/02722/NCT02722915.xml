	<detailed_description>This study investigate brain plasticity neuromodulation fMRI neurofeedback verbal auditory hallucination ( AVH ) . The new technique real-time fMRI enable subject influence brain activity certain area base neurofeedback . Current brain activity measure fMRI report participant real time via brain computer interface ( BCI ) . Due identification contingency feedback mental strategy subject able control brain activity consciously . This provide opportunity control symptoms AVH . Neurofeedback test subject schizophrenia , lead conscious control circumscribe brain area . Recent study show , addition modulation single area , neurofeedback also modulate connectivity different area . Thus , possible regulate single brain region also whole network . AVH key symptom schizophrenia . They limit social function significantly resistant therapy antipsychotic 25 % case . AVH also occur 6-15 % healthy population , without meet diagnostic criterion schizophrenia psychiatric disorder . This study perform direct , not-invasive selective modulation network underlie AVH assess neural , cognitive emotional effect . The focus study connectivity auditory cortex inferior frontal cortex . Various study demonstrate auditory cortex exhibit abnormal function schizophrenia patient . It show AVH , auditory cortex ( superior temporal lobe ) inferior frontal cortex synchronize spontaneously . These region play essential role speech perception processing . An increased synchronisation area could lead development AVH . This study try reduce frontotemporal connectivity uncouple region . Increasing connectivity area serve control condition furthermore intensify perceive control brain activity associate AVH . Thus , patient learn factor influence appearance hallucination .</detailed_description>
