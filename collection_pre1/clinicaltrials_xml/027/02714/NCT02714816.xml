	<brief_summary>The inherited retinal dystrophy clinically genetically heterogeneous group condition , often present childhood . These disorder usefully divide accord whether ( ) stationary progressive ; ( ii ) exhibit predominantly rod cone involvement , central receptor disease . The underlie molecular genetic basis majority monogenic inherit retinal disease characterise . Leber Congenital Amaurosis ( LCA ) diagnosis group severe , autosomal recessively inherit rod - cone dystrophies typically result complete visual loss third fourth decade life . One form , LCA2 , cause mutation gene encode RPE56 , RPE-specific 65-kDa isomerase . Non-functional RPE65 result photoreceptor cell unable respond light result patient visually impair . Proof principle study RPE65 gene replacement therapy demonstrate use recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 ( rAAV2/2 ) vector animal model . Furthermore clinical trial gene replacement therapy RPE65 associate LCA ( RPE65-LCA ) show significant promise . All three clinical trial show improvement visual function first year , however long term follow demonstrate progressive visual loss initial improvement maintain . Greater efficacy note animal model feel relatively low efficacy treatment participant likely due insufficient production RPE65 protein AAV2/2 hRPE65 human eye . As maximal tolerate vector dose reach AAV2/2 hRPE65 , optimise therapeutic vector ( AAV2/5-OPTIRPE65 ) develop drive high transgene expression level . ( Professor Robin Ali Prof James Bainbridge - unpublished data ) . In preparation human clinical trial , detailed prospective phenotypic study undertaken investigate natural history RPE65-LCA . Such study help identify suitable patient therapeutic intervention . Furthermore great phenotyping optimal window intervention specific parameter help quantify effect identify clinical end point may ascertain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study Patients With Leber Congenital Amaurosis Associated With Mutations RPE65</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers successful continued study previously ascertain subject . Further patient already MEH genetic database also recruit . Given rarity LCA-RPE65 investigator also potentially recruit patient refer Moorfields Hospital consultant around World . Subjects assess annually total 5 year follow-up . Recruitment target approximately 15 25 genetically confirm patient . Assessments undertaken depend age , co-operation ability undertake test include ( see schedule assessment ) : 8.1 Complete clinical ocular examination , include visual acuity test ( near distance ) , contrast sensitivity , anterior segment slit lamp examination posterior segment slit lamp examination . 8.2 Colour fundus photography . 8.3 SDOCT imaging . In order ensure good volume scan minimal oversampling perform undertake sufficient B scan per volume ( n=128 ) . The investigator high-resolution line scan oversampling , 1 horizontal 1 vertical , centre fovea . 8.4 Adaptive optic image . 8.5 Electrophysiological assessment incorporating protocol recommend International Society Clinical Electrophysiology Vision ( ISCEV ) . Full-field electroretinogram ( FFERG ) - measure global retinal function - undertaken previously document undetectable - majority patient undetectable FFERG . Pattern ERG ( PERG ) multifocal ERG ( mfERG ) undertaken annual basis determine change central retinal function time ( often residual central function till late disease ) - repeat find undetectable . 8.6 Visual Field Testing . The Octopus 900 perimeter use . Static full-field test undertaken employ GATE strategy , size V test target . Further analysis undertaken model entire hill-of-vision enhance information obtain full-field static perimetry . 8.7 Mesopic Scotopic Microperimetry . 8.8 Colour vision test . 8.9 Vision guide mobility . This assess measure ability subject navigate simple route range control illuminance . 8.10 Quality Life Questionnaire . 8.11 Blood test . Molecular confirmation mutation within RPE65 gene accredit laboratory may undertake . Specific Aims study Perform detail phenotyping , include autofluorescence imaging , microperimetry , AO OCT imaging , spectral sensitivity visual field testing , previously ascertain patient newly identify subject . Obtain OCT AO image use late high-resolution technology order gain insight vivo retinal structure compare functional data obtain Thereby establish well-characterised cohort individual RPE65-LCA . To use information gain provide accurate advice patient assist identify potential participant , time point intervene , efficacy endpoint may use planned intervention .</detailed_description>
