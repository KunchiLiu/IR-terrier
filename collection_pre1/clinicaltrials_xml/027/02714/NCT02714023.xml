	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose acute appendicitis consent randomized two arm trial . In one arm , patient receive irrigation abdomen surgery normal saline , salt water . In arm , patient receive irrigation abdomen surgery sterile water . Sometimes patient receive irrigation none determine needed time operation surgeon . We follow patient surgery 30 day . The hypothesis study use sterile water irrigation fluid surgery patient acute appendicitis decrease chance post-operative abscess infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Water And Saline Head-to-head In The Blinded Evaluation Study Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient , age 6 , present emergent interval appendectomy one participate surgeon potentially enrol study . Prior surgery , patient patient 's guardian minor , inform study consent ( assent minor obtain ) request . If consent obtain , patient 's name medical record number send inpatient pharmacy . They randomly assign use master list either water saline arm . The pharmacy send correct solution operate room form 3 one Liter bag . This order prior go operate room . Next , laparoscopic open appendectomy perform accord current standard care . The surgeon also free convert laparoscopic procedure open procedure deem appropriate clinical judgment . The type irrigant use case , however , blind surgeon . The surgeon use much irrigation solution deem necessary base intra-operative decision . This likely affect study , standard amount irrigation need appendectomy , wish change current practice surgeon . Additionally , study question sterile water decrease infectious rate affect either . The science study remain whether 10 mL 3000 mL irrigation solution utilize . The surgeon may use irrigation deem necessary adequately wash abdomen remove particulate matter blood clot . At end case , surgeon record amount irrigant use along surgery date , duration symptom , surgery start finish time , preoperative antibiotic , height weight . The patient follow study 30 day surgery . There usually follow office visit one two week procedure . A chart review case capture length stay , post-operative antibiotic , pathology report result , complication consist prolonged ileus ( &gt; 2 day ) , bowel obstruction , prolong fever ( &gt; 2 day ) , post-operative abscess , irrigation volume , wound infection .</detailed_description>
