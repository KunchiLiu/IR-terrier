	<brief_title>Response Clozapine Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia : A Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective proton spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) study design compare level glutamate , glutamine , glx , glutathione age- gender- match patient poor response clozapine ( URS ) , patient good response clozapine ( non-URS ) , healthy control . Participants schizophrenia fail respond optimal treatment least two different non-clozapine antipsychotic ( i.e . treatment-resistant schizophrenia [ TRS ] ) start clozapine part clinical care recruit . A sample healthy control also recruit . Participants TRS two 1H-MRS scan . The 1H-MRS scan perform within 1 week 12 week clozapine initiation . Clinical assessment perform within 1 week 1H-MRS scan 6 week clozapine treatment . Cognitive assessment also perform within 1 week 1H-MRS scan . Healthy control also undergo two 1H-MRS scan 12-week interval . Cognitive assessment also perform within 1 week 1H-MRS scan .</detailed_description>
