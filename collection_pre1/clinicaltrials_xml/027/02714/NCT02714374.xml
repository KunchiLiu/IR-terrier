	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety investigational product GL-ONC1 combination eculizumab . GL-ONC1 , vaccinia virus , genetically modify use potential anti-cancer drug destroy cancer cell . Vaccinia virus use successfully past smallpox vaccine million people worldwide . Eculizumab type drug call monoclonal antibody . This drug design inhibit activity protein call complement . Complement part body 's immune system destroy remove foreign particle . Evidence laboratory test suggest eculizumab may allow GL-ONC1 stay body longer clear immune system , may help destroy cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effect GL-ONC1 Administered IV With Without Eculizumab Prior Surgery Patients With Solid Organ Cancers Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized Phase 1b dose escalation study evaluate safety effect oncolytic virus GL-ONC1 administer intravenously , without eculizumab , prior surgery patient advance solid organ tumor . GL-ONC1 investigate early stage clinical trial United States Europe via systemic delivery monotherapy combination therapy , via regional delivery monotherapy . GL-ONC1 treatment well tolerate across different malignancy , route administration , monotherapy well combination therapy protocol . The ability GL-ONC1 infect tumor tissue kill tumor cell demonstrate . In addition , virus-induced immune activation elevation serum marker link favorable antitumor immune response observe . Eculizumab monoclonal antibody design inhibit activity protein call complement part body 's innate immune system . Evidence laboratory test suggest eculizumab may allow GL-ONC1 stay body longer clear immune system . The goal study evaluate safety concurrent systemic administration eculizumab GL-ONC1 ass pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics profile GL-ONC1 vivo .</detailed_description>
