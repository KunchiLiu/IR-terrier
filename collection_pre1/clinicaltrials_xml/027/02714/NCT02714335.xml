	<brief_summary>Considering low expression rate Melanoma-associated antigen 3 ( MAGE-A3 ) Asian especially Southeast Asian , would great interest investigate potential polymorphism MAGE-A3 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) patient Taiwan . Meanwhile , also interest study expression Preferentially Expressed Antigen In Melanoma ( PRAME ) Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation status well find significant factor may affect expression smoking status , histological type , tumour size stage Taiwan .</brief_summary>
