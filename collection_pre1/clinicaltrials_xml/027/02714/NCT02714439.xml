	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate different type medical equipment call `` High-Resolution Microendoscope '' diagnosis cervical pre-cancerous lesion cervical cancer . We want compare patient ' clinical finding use current equipment clinic clinical finding use new equipment test research project . If new equipment proven give comparable finding current equipment use , doctor might able offer diagnosis treat cervical lesion one visit . It might necessary wait cervical biopsy come back woman would receive indicated treatment .

	<detailed_description>Participant start examination colposcopic evaluation use current equipment determine standard care . But , cervical biopsy indicate , perform participant 's biopsy , research purpose only- researcher : - Apply substance call Proflavine 0.01 % participant 's cervix - Researchers re-evaluate participant 's cervix new equipment testing- The High-Resolution Microendoscope - After complete re-evaluation , researcher continue standard care protocol perform participant 's cervical biopsy indicate . The entire re-evaluation new equipment add le 10 minute standard examination . When woman find abnormal PAP smear , depend finding clinical history , woman need evaluate colposcope order understand reason abnormal PAP determine best 2 7 treatment . This call colposcopic examination standard care . This procedure perform clinic , patient position examine table way position Pap smear , speculum place inside vaginal canal , certain substance apply cervix order identify cervical lesion . These substance might include acetic acid and/or lugol . The application substances help delineate abnormal cervical area might need biopsied . For purpose research study , obtain biopsy , second evaluation perform use equipment study ( High- Resolution Microendoscope ) use different substance apply cervix . This substance call Proflavine 0.01 % . Proflavine substance use fluorescent image around world without adverse effect report . This second evaluation take 10 minute . After complete second evaluation , participant 's clinical examination clinical visit continue routine . There known risk associate equipment use study . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) also determine device researcher use research study meet definition non-significant risk device FDA regulation . The anticipated total number subject involve study 250 woman . All anticipate participating woman would The University Texas Medical Branch . The length time patient 's participation 1 year . However , participant 's year enrollment might one examination , one visit , use research equipment .</detailed_description>
