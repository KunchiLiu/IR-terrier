	<brief_summary>Diastolic function may evaluate different measurement transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) . They include mitral inflow velocity obtain pulsed-wave doppler ( PW ) : peak early diastolic velocity ( E ) late diastolic velocity ( A ) . Mitral annulus velocity , early diastolic ( e ' ) late diastolic ( ' ) obtain tissue doppler imaging ( TDI ) . The ratio E/e ' reflect leave ventricular filling pressure , , might predictor fluid responsiveness . The aim study evaluate predictive value mitral valve E/e ' ratio fluid responsiveness among patient undergo coronary bypass graft surgery . Fluid responsiveness define increase stroke volume ≥ 15 % . After induction anesthesia , patient diastolic function evaluate mean E/e ' measure . They administer intravenous bolus 500 mL Lactate Ringer® along passive leg raise ( PLR ) . Stroke volume fluid responsiveness assess thermodilution method ( Swan-Ganz catheter ) FloTrac® device . Fluid responder compare non-responders evaluate relationship E/e ' ratio fluid responsiveness .</brief_summary>
