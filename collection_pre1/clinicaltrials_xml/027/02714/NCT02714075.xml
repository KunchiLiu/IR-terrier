	<brief_summary>Rice fortify ferric pyrophosphate ( FePP ) , low bioavailability human subject . Compounds citric acid/trisodium citrate ( CA/TSC ) sodium ethylene-diamine tetraacetic-acid ( EDTA ) could serve absorption enhancer . Recent finding single meal study indicate CA/TSC enhance effect iron absorption FePP-fortified rice . In contrast , ZnO suggest detrimental effect . Furthermore , vitro finding suggest increase iron solubility iron EDTA-co-fortified rice - bioavailability human remain investigated . These effect thus investigate 'real-life ' condition , fortify rice implement complete diet administer throughout several day target population rice fortification program . Objective : To assess iron absorption diet different iron fortify rice formulation iron deficient anaemic child . The investigator aim conduct iron absorption study 30 Ghanaian school-age child investigate different fortification approach multiple meal randomize , cross study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Iron Absorption From Extruded FePP-fortified Rice Containing Zinc , Citric Acid/Trisodium Citrate EDTA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron differ molecular weight ( 54Fe , 56Fe , 57Fe , 58Fe ) nutrient additives extruded rice kernel , kernel blend regular unfortified rice administer study participant . Recruitment study participant local investigator close collaboration Ghanaian school authority . Before start study , 6 child ask participate pilot testing , administer 2 portion rice ( 50 g dry weight ) vegetable sauce four hour delay meal . This allow investigator define , optimal portion size , use throughout study . For participation , child receive small symbolic gift . The investigator envisage screen approximately 60 child live Tamale surround rural area least one week study start . Recruitment participant do reach number 30 eligible participant . Participant 's caretaker explain study procedure need sign consent form participant expose study procedure . Participants screen assign unique study identification ( run number participant 's initial ) , keep include study . All data keep confidential . The medical history , dietary intake data data concern socioeconomic status assess use questionnaire , body temperature , height weight measure z-scores ( weight age ) calculate . A blood sample collect participant initial determination iron status , detection parasitic infection ( include measurement hemoglobin ( Hb ) , serum ferritin ( SF ) , soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) , Zinc protoporphyrin heme ratio ( ZPP ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Alpha acid glycoprotein , malaria parasitemia . All screen participant receive appropriate dose anthelmintic free charge , unless receive accord treatment within last two month . Based information obtain screening , in-/ exclusion criterion check participant 's eligibility judge accordingly . Thirty iron deficient and/or anemic child ( hereafter call participant ) include absorption study . For initial determination iron status infection detection , child receive symbolic gift investigator . There monetary compensation participation ; however , child caregiver receive symbolic gift completion study . Potential transport cost child caregiver cover project . The whole study duration eleven week ( exclude screen pilot test ) . Participants donate one blood sample screen two blood sample remain study period . Between Monday Friday , participant receive two meal per day , one morning ( first meal ) one noon ( second meal ) . One type test meal always administer throughout five consecutive day . In total participant receive 60 rice meal meal consist approximately 50 g regular unfortified rice , 0.5 g extrude fortified rice , 30 g sauce 250 ml water . The definite rice amount administer decide upon pilot investigation . The order test meal give week partially randomize . Thus , test meal A , B C give throughout 1 week week 1 3 , test meal D , E R give week 6 8 . Meals contain iron molecular weight ( 58 Fe , 57Fe 54Fe ) administer least 16 day apart , restriction randomization . The participant allow eat 8 PM drink 12 AM day study visit , meal three hour finish second meal , unless give snack investigator explicitly allow eat . Each meal administration take approximately 25 minute . This procedure follow six week , two week break week 3 6 ( dietary restriction within break-period ) . The test meal base 50 g regular unfortified rice 0.5 g extrude fortified rice ( dry weight ) . The meal administer one two traditional sauce , low ( sauce A ) moderate ( sauce B ) phytic acid ( PA ) content . Sauce A base tomato onion , sauce B base cowpea . The rice meal prepare individually subject , sauce prepare bulk study start . All meal serve 250 ml water . The test meal design match ~2/3 average dietary requirement age-group . In case rice meal provide enough energy ( ~700 - 900 kcal ) , investigator administer standardize snack consume fasting period .</detailed_description>
