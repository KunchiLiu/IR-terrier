	<brief_title>The Role Attention Demanding Activity Priming Motor Learning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This propose study randomize trial effect use attention demand prime prior practice previously untrained motor task population young healthy individual . Therefore , The investigator randomize group motor learn paradigm . The experimental group prime activity require high attention demand . The control group perform activity match practice amount require less attention demand . Both group perform activity immediately prior practice previously untrained motor task . The objective aim compare experimental group control group determine effect attention demand prime amount , rate , transfer acquisition learn motor task . On day one study , participant consent . Demographic information , participant 's hand dominance ( self-report ) , level arousal document . Level arousal assess use Stanford Sleepiness Scale . Each participant perform baseline measure previously untrained motor task , functional task simulates feed , two motor task practice use determine transfer practice task . One task card sort task , share similar spatio-temporal characteristic simulate feed task . The transfer task button task dissimilar spatio-temporal characteristic compare simulate feed task . Baseline measurement consist two trial motor task trial order randomize task . Each participant randomize either experimental group control group use block randomization technique . Participants randomize experimental group perform attention demand task , variant Simon Task , tell emphasize accuracy speed order prime attention . Participants randomize control group perform similar task ; however tell emphasize speed accuracy ; thereby create sham prime . Following completion cognitive task , group immediately begin practice 50 trial simulate feed task . Following completion practice simulate feed task , participant perform 2 trial card sort task buttoning task determine transfer unpracticed task . Participants return day 2 perform 2 trial simulate feed task ass short term retention . Participants return day 8 complete two trial motor task ( simulated feeding task , card sort task , button task ) determine delay retention transfer . The Attention Demanding Activity : The attention demand activity variant Simon Task , choice reaction time task . In task , participant instruct respond quickly accurately possible , push one two button correspond direction arrow present visually computer screen , ignore spatial location arrow . Arrows present one two condition : congruent incongruent . Each arrow precede fixation cross present 250 millisecond center display follow blank screen 100 millisecond . The arrow present participant responds 250 millisecond 750 millisecond elapse depend group . In congruent condition , arrow appear side space direction facing ( e.g . right face arrow right side space ) . In incongruent condition , arrow present opposite side space direction facing ( e.g . right face arrow left side space ) . There high proportion congruent trial ( 75 % ; 480 trial ) incongruent trial ( 25 % ; 160 trial ) . In addition verbal instruction , response deadline place . In order ensure experimental group focus accuracy speed , deadline throughout activity 750 millisecond . The control group 250 millisecond respond on-screen stimulus ensure focus speed accuracy . If deadline meet give trial , message appear participant `` Deadline Missed . Faster ! '' Every 15 trial , evaluate , 33 % deadline miss , message appear indicate participant miss many deadline imperative deadline meet , even error result . The previously untrained motor task : The investigator choose use functional upper extremity motor task simulate feed . This task require participant spoon bean ( kidney , raw ) central , proximal `` start '' cup 3 distal `` target '' cup fast possible . The cup ( 9.5 centimeter diameter ) secure board 3 cup secure radially 45 degree , 90 degree , 135 degree around start cup distance 16 centimeter . The start cup orient along participant 's midline 15 centimeter front seat participant . One repetition motor task consist spoon 2 bean start cup target cup non-dominant hand , one trial equal 15 repetition . During trial , participant move first ipsilateral target cup , next center target cup , contralateral cup , relative hand use ( right vs. leave ) . This sequence repeat five time complete trial . The participant begin trial non-dominant hand side spoon . Each trial begin administrator give verbal cue `` go '' end spoon return start position ( 5 centimeter lateral start cup ) . The time take complete 15 repetition ( `` trial time '' ) measure performance , fast time indicate good performance . All trial time near 100th second via stopwatch . Participants give explicit feedback ( i.e . knowledge performance result ) trial . They also encourage coach use specific pattern upper extremity kinematics training . Transfer task similar spatio-temporal characteristic : This task card sort task . This task require participant place standard play card central , proximal `` start '' box three distal target box fast possible . The box ( 9 centimeter X 9 centimeter ) secure board 3 box secure radially 45 degree , 90 degree , 135 degree around start box distance 16 centimeter . The start box orient along participant 's midline 15 centimeter front seat participant card face . One repetition motor task consist place one card time ; face , start box target box non-dominant hand one trial equal 15 repetition . During trial , participant move first ipsilateral target box , next center target box , contralateral box , relative hand use ( right vs. leave ) . This sequence repeat ten time complete trial . The participant begin trial non-dominant hand side start box . Each trial begin administrator give verbal cue `` go '' end participant place hand back start location last card rest target box . The time take complete 30 repetition ( `` trial time '' ) measure performance , fast time indicate good performance . All trial time near 100th second via stopwatch . Participants give explicit feedback ( i.e . knowledge performance result ) trial . They also encourage coach use specific pattern upper extremity kinematics training . Transfer task dissimilar spatio-temporal characteristic : This task require fasten button sequentially . At start trial , participant begin button top ten button ( 3 centimeter apart ) sew 2 centimeter apart vertically piece plain weave cotton fabric . Both piece fabric secure wooden board placket center line subject 's non-dominant shoulder . The button side fabric fold onto board , buttonhole side fabric unfold onto table prior trial . Buttons fasten horizontal buttonhole leave right order , relative participant . Participants fasten ten button sequentially unfasten button reverse order use non-dominant hand . The time take fasten unfasten 10 button trial time measure performance , fast time indicate good performance . All trial time near 100th second via stopwatch . Participants give explicit feedback ( i.e . knowledge performance result ) trial . They also encourage coach use specific pattern upper extremity kinematics training . This task perform subject 's non-dominate upper extremity .</detailed_description>
