	<brief_summary>Objective : gain experience child young adolescent in-home use algorithm dose insulin minimize project hyperglycemia overnight addition suspend pump hypoglycemia project overnight obtain feasibility , safety , initial efficacy data Study Design : randomize controlled trial , randomization night level within subject Patient Population : Youth 6.0 - &lt; 15 year old type 1 diabetes treat daily insulin therapy least one year insulin infusion pump least 6 month HbA1c &lt; 10.0 % . Sample Size : 30 subject Study Duration Visit Schedule : duration approximately 3 month , preliminary run-in activity follow 90 day spend clinical trial phase study ; clinic visit enrollment , follow CGM system assessment run-in phase , start clinical trial phase , 21-day point clinical trial phase , 42 night successful system use Major Efficacy Outcomes : - Primary : time range ( 70-180 mg/dl , 3.9-10.0 mmol/L ) overnight . - Secondary : time spend hypoglycemia ( &lt; 70 mg/dl , 3.9 mmol/L ) time spend hyperglycemia ( &gt; 180 mg/dl , 10.0 mmol/L ) overnight . Major Safety Outcomes : CGM measure hypo- hyperglycemia , include morning blood glucose mean overnight sensor glucose ; adverse event include severe hypoglycemia diabetic ketoacidosis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects eligible clinical trial initially use Veo insulin pump Enlite CGM sensor home minimum 6 days/week 2-week period verify subject able use CGM insert sensor . The first 10 subject enrol 11 &lt; 15 year age participate Algorithm Assessment Phase approximately 10 night system use PLGS Hyper Minimization active . Results approximate 100 night review study DSMB ass safety determine whether adjustment algorithm parameter need . If adjustment need , Algorithm Assessment Phase repeat age restriction , use 10 subject possible . If adjustment need DSMB judge safe continue study , enrollment continue across full 6 &lt; 15 age range . Subjects enroll study completion Algorithm Assessment Phase use closed-loop system home 5 night system use PLGS Hyper Minimization active demonstrate ability use system submit study data Coordinating Center . Subjects successfully demonstrate ability use system home describe eligible randomized trial phase . This phase consist use full system home approximately 42 night : - Each night blood glucose level check BG meter use perform calibration CGM . This calibration must occur 90 minute prior activation system . NOTE : Subjects instruct calibrate CGM per manufacturer guideline . - Then system activate , link CGM insulin pump computer bedside . - A randomization schedule laptop use determine whether system run PLGS+Hyper Minimization mode PLGS-only . - Subjects blind whether system run PLGS+Hyper Minimization mode PLGS-only . - There alarm pump shuts automate insulin dose occurs . The CGM alarm set 60 mg/dL ( 3.3 mmol/L ) . When CGM alarm occurs , subject ask measure blood glucose BG meter , he/she aware alarm . - The time period outcome assessment night time system activate turned morning . - Pump shut , occur , 120 minute 150-minute period , 180 minute entire night . Multiple instance pump suspension occur recurrent prediction hypoglycemia night . - Small correction bolus insulin delivered system predict hyperglycemia pre-set threshold occur , insulin-on-board constraint cumulative delivery limit minimize likelihood excessive insulin delivery . - Subjects ask check blood glucose study BG meter morning prior breakfast enter result use controller software interface . The subject instruct contact study physician morning blood glucose value &lt; 60 mg/dl ( 3.3 mmol/L ) &gt; 300 mg/dl ( 16.7 mmol/L ) . Monitoring process ensure subject contact value report required range . - Subjects ask record overnight carbohydrate intake use controller software interface . - Subjects ask perform periodic CGM data uploads use controller software interface . Monitoring process ensure subject contact uploads occur require , review upload reveals extreme , prolong episode hypoglycemia hyperglycemia , elevate morning blood glucose value . Once approximately 200 night randomize clinical trial phase data available , study DSMB perform another data review determine whether safe continue study . Subjects already use study system home continue use DSMB review process , additional subject begin home use system DSMB review complete . Upon completion study , subject well study clinician ask complete human factor usability questionnaire regard use study system . There follow-up ( optional ) extension phase subject exhibit safe competent use system home . They may give option continue home use system 56 day assess whether data-driven , subject-level customization algorithm parameter improve glycemic outcome compare generic algorithm parameter identical subject .</detailed_description>
