	<brief_summary>Retrospective laboratory evaluation detection rate CHIKV infection real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR ) urine . Urine serum sample patient confirm CHIKV infection endemic area ( Aruba ) ITM analyze . The result evaluate case-by-case basis : time since onset , patient characteristic , severity symptom , serology result . The positivity in-time CHIKV RNA urine evaluate comparison viremia . Patients suspect acute CHIKV infection ask ( write inform consent ; annex 1 ) provide urine sample within 72 hour onset disease , follow urine sample day 7 , day 10 , day 14 three urine sample 3 , 4 12 week onset . They ask provide serum sample within 72 hour onset disease , follow serum sample day 7 , day 10 , day 14 . In total , twenty patient initial positive result CHIKV RT-PCR serum include follow-up . The number urine sample test 140 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RT-PCR Urine Samples : Added Value Diagnosis Chikungunya Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . To assess added value RT-PCR CHIKV urine sample diagnose CHIKV infection comparison reference method . 2 . To describe kinetics RT- PCR CHIKV urine sample diagnose CHIKV infection time . Study design , population , material method : Prospective cohort study patient confirm CHIKV infection ( positive RT-PCR CHIKV sample time inclusion seroconversion define positive anti-CHIKV Immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody assay day 14 ) , attend outpatient clinic Institute Tropical Medicine Antwerp Horacio Oduber Hospitaal Aruba within 72 hour fever onset . After sign informed consent , clinical epidemiological data record standardized Case Record Form . Baseline blood urine sample collect required routine clinical evaluation individual case ; sample include serum CHIKV serologic assay , CHIKV E1 ( similar rapid test ) , well serum urine RT-PCR CHIKV . After initial evaluation , suspect CHIKV case schedule biweekly serum urine collection RT-PCR CHIKV duration 2 week , 3 , 4 12 week . Serum 4 week use second serologic assay . Suspected case test negative CHIKV RT-PCR serum exclude . Study population : patient confirm CHIKV infection Sample size : panel 20 CHIKV confirm case Data analysis reporting : The percentage positive urine RT-PCR ( different time-points duration CHIKV infection ) calculate . Proportions positivity rate test χ²-test equality proportion . Ct-values two different sample type ( serum/urine ) compare calculation Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient ( ρ ) . The Ct-values measure subtract ( indicated ∆Ct ) mean ∆Ct-values ( ± 95 % confidence interval ) calculate . Reporting accordance Standards Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy ( STARD ) guideline . Endpoints : diagnostic sensitivity CHIKV RT-PCR urine sample patient confirm CHIKV infection , comparison analytical sensitivity ( base Ct-values ) RT-PCR serum , positivity rate RT-PCR urine sample time Ethical issue : Informed consent obtain study participant . Demographic , geographic , clinical laboratory data obtain ; data de-identified store encoded database ( code know principal investigator ) . Ethical approval ITM/ University Hospital Antwerp ( UZA ) Ethics Committee ( EC ) EC Aruba . Expected result relevance : Evaluation sensitivity RT-PCR urine sample diagnose CHIKV infection post-viremic phase endemic non-endemic setting . Possible advantage use PCR urine serological assay : 1. shift timeframe accurately diagnose CHIKV infection could benefit return traveler consult acute phase . 2. use single specimen obtain non-invasive procedure 3. high specificity 4. opportunity type CHIKV strain .</detailed_description>
