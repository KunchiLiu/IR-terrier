	<brief_summary>Consuming whey protein may beneficial effect health , principally impact blood glucose metabolism , also affect appetite . The purpose project investigate effect consume whey protein preload prior breakfast , follow bout low/moderate intensity exercise ( brisk walking ) , glucose lipid blood well appetite . It hypothesise consumption whey protein meal prior low/moderate intensity exercise may positively affect postprandial handle well appetite sensation consequently reduce intake subsequent meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A crossover design shall implement , whereby participant complete 3 experimental trial random order , separate minimum 5 day . Participants ask record dietary intake 24 hour trial provide standardised meal consume set time previous evening . At visit participant shall report lab approximately 08.00 hour follow 12 hour fast refrain caffeine , alcohol vigorous physical activity 24 hour . After determination body mass stature , cannula shall insert antecubital vein order collect venous blood sample . A baseline blood sample ( 10ml ) shall collect , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) complete order ass appetite sensation . Following 30 minute exercise bout shall complete two trial , 30 minute seat rest carry control trial . Participants shall walk motorise treadmill predetermine speed design reflect 55 % estimate maximal aerobic capacity . Heart rate perceive exertion sample every three minute , expire air shall sample two minute period 5 , 15 25 minute . During preload trial , participant shall consume whey protein beverage 15 minute completion exercise bout . This consist 23g whey protein isolate powder ( 20g protein ) combine 200ml water 10 drop energy-free flavouring create milkshake-type beverage . In trial isovolumetric bolus similarly flavoured water shall consume . After 15 minute participant shall consume mixed-macronutrient breakfast meal condition , subsequently rest 240 minute period . An ad libitum pasta meal shall consume end period trial order ass subsequent energy intake . Regular blood sample shall collect throughout .</detailed_description>
