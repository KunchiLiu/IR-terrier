	<brief_summary>In experiment , investigator study effect mass medium family plan campaign contraception relate behavior . The study take place Burkina Faso , country average six child bear woman , modern contraceptive prevalence rate ( mCPR ) estimate 15 % 2010 national level , per Demographic Health Survey ( DHS ) 2010 report Burkina Faso . The aim study provide robust evidence efficiency cost-effectiveness intense three-year mass medium campaign focus family planning . The campaign diffuse message financial health benefit family planning , information different type , source , advantage , disadvantage different contraceptive method . The study target woman age reproduction rural area Burkina Faso measure effect intervention total modern contraceptive prevalence rate , perception family planning , contraception-related behavior , general gender norm . Burkina Faso ideal place evaluate impact radio campaign high percentage rural population listen local radio local language . Radio station area distinct target local language reach limited government decree , allow implementation randomize control trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Development Media International ( DMI ) , non-governmental organization ( NGO ) run medium campaign induce behavioral change develop country , implement mass medium campaign conjunction community radio station rural area Burkina Faso . The study take place coverage area 16 radio station , select way prevent overlap coverage area , different local language campaign diffuse . This strategy limit possible `` leakage '' treatment control group . Out 16 cluster radio station , 8 randomly assign receive medium campaign , 8 leave control . Within radio station cluster , small rural village access electricity sample order limit access television . The radio station urban semi-urban area , village 5 km away radio station exclude . Villages within radio station cluster randomly select participate study . A household listing survey conduct select village get exhaustive list household basic information woman within household . In addition , village survey conduct village chief get good sense demographic key figure village . Based information provide listing woman age reproduction , eligible woman randomly select participate study . These woman invite take baseline survey , 3 year later , endline survey , therefore forming panel structure . In addition listing , village , woman survey , clinic survey take place monitor demand supply contraceptive method different area . The clinic questionnaire ask contraception relate behavior , include perception family planning , usage contraception , number pregnancy abortion , among thing . The investigator also seek administrative data clinic within radio station area examine whether distribution contraceptive product higher treatment area . The effect medium campaign analyze base information provide woman partner perceive use traditional modern contraceptive method , cross-verified information provide demand contraception family plan clinic survey . Qualitative research take place prior launch campaign order well formulate message could reach target audience . -Data collection , reporting , analysis : The data collection conduct Innovations Poverty Action ( IPA ) , NGO specialize conduct randomize control trial ( RCTs ) presence experience Burkina Faso . Data collect questionnaire use Personal Digital Assistance ( PDA ) . For qualitative research questionnaire , answer might record use paper . The surveyor might audio-record part interview woman health facility use PDAs monitor survey quality performance enumerator . The result datasets cod clearly label accordance information provide questionnaire . Data collect enumerator train IPA importance confidentiality data , transparency , accuracy report information . Backchecks also conduct make sure data provide consistent correct . Protocols develop address adverse event data collection enumerator go back supervisor IPA office address complication . In addition , high frequency check conduct whenever new data come monitor quality data collection , value different variable miss value vary enumerator location . Logic check conduct make sure value variables fall within logical range . This allow quick detection correction major outlier high rate attrition . Finally , adverse event report Massachusetts Institute Technology 's internal review board ( Committee Use Humans Experimental Subjects ) quickly possible accordance human subject requirement . -Sample size minimum detectable effect : The total sample size approximately 8,000 woman across 250 village 16 radio cluster . To calculate sample size , power calculation conduct use simulation Stata . Having two level cluster ( region village level ) , two intracluster correlation ( ICC ) level use power calculation , base 2010 DHS data woman Burkina Faso . The DHS data reveal modern contraceptive prevalence rate ( mCPR ) 9 % among woman reproductive age ( union single ) rural area region study take place . For calculation , baseline level mCPR 12 % assume , therefore allow increase usage time . Based number calculation , study power detect minimum 6 percentage point increase mCPR . If assume baseline level mCPR close actual one , power expect increase investigator ( 1 ) use match stratification baseline level contraception prevalence rate radio station level ( level treatment assignment ) , addition stratify village selection distance health clinic , individual selection woman several characteristic education access radio ( 2 ) control baseline level explanatory variable baseline level outcome , ( 3 ) use panel structure . It possible , however , total modern contraceptive prevalence rate higher actual sample value assume base 2010 DHS data , could reduce power .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion study radio station cluster treatment randomize base follow criterion : The cluster least one local radio station adequate Frequency Modulation ( FM ) ray cover zone Different radio station ' coverage area overlap The criterion village selection follow : Villages must less 1,500 inhabitant per 2006 Burkina Faso census , except couple radio station cluster village sample 4,200 inhabitant due low number small village . The radio station campaign diffuse , semiurban urban location , include village 5 km away station We consider village limit access electricity We consider village le 10 km away clinic per available estimate ( Geographic Institute Burkina Faso village chief ) Individual level criterion : We survey woman age reproduction , i.e . 15 49 year age measure listing Exclusion criterion : No particular exclusion criterion inclusion criterion list met .</criteria>
