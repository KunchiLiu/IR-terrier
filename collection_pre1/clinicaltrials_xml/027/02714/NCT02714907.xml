	<brief_title>Clinical Data Validation Novel Wireless Cortrium C3 Monitor Continuous Electrocardiogram Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Development new cost effective mobile device wireless technology great potential supervision critically ill patient ward well ambulant . Through continuous wireless monitoring hospital patient home , detection heart arrhythmias atrial fibrillation ( AF ) possible . AF cause sizeable amount stroke ( 15 % , 35 % population 80 year age ) , prevented anticoagulation treatment provide time . Thus , many patient refer cardiologic ambulatory examine AF , subject heart monitor so-called Holter event monitor . This entail patient equip several electrode chest , lead attach connect sizable bulky box . The patient carry box around hang shoulder , belt something similar one several day . It require patient come back deliver device , data must read analyse , order work plan patient . During admission , similar system attach continuous heart monitoring . Cortrium ( http : //cortrium.com ) develop wireless technology , small C3 monitor attach chest standard electrodes lead build actual monitor . The quality signal test healthy adult , yet test patient suffer arrhythmia The purpose study validate quality ECG-signal acquire Cortrium C3 monitor . The intention evaluate whether diagnosis atrial fibrillation base ECG signal C3 monitor concur current monitoring method use clinical practice . The measurement perform patient investigation AF cardiology ambulatory Y Frederiksberg-Bispebjerg Hospital . The patient outfit C3 monitor simultaneous use conventional ambulatory apparatus . This `` Holter monitor '' ( Rozinn station RZ152+12 RZ153+ ScottCare Holter Windows 2010 ( CE0120 ) `` EventCare SA version '' ( CE0120 ) , buy via SEMCA Ap , Sk√¶vinge , Denmark . Recordings usual apparatus analyse usual fashion cardiology ambulatory . A copy recording register anonymously pair simultaneous recording C3 . The diagnosis make two observer , blind patient identity data source . Thus , data personally identifiable . Validation perform collaboration department cardiology . Statistics : With simultaneous supervision 77 patient increase incidence AF possible determine whether C3 capable detect AF least 95 % case Holter detects . Since incidence AF Is low total patient group refer Holter monitoring , plan include 150 patient acquire usable number examination . Economic Conditions Helen Dominguez unfunded , responsible consultant study . Opeon Aps delivers C3 monitor clinical trial well brochure guide patient health care personnel . There economic benefit connect present clinical trial . Publication Results : Opeon ApS ( owner Cortrium ) responsible process material publication result international peer-reviewed journal well Danish popular scientific press relate new Medical equipment . Positive , negative inconclusive result publish . Recruitment Participants : Patients plan ambulatory arrhythmia record diagnosis intermittent AF ask telephone consider participate study . After read participant information flyer , subject invite in-depth verbal information ambulatory . If subject accept participate provide sign informed consent , outfit C3 monitor along standard Holter apparatus . The study include subject schedule Holter monitoring refer atrial fibrillation examination , quantification paroxysm , heart rate paroxysm . Ethical Considerations : Ethical Considerations : If patient agrees take part study , main disadvantage entail attachment another three electrode C3 monitor , increase risk skin irritation , receive additional instruction two device . Since ECG recording non-invasive , C3 record result ambulatory visit otherwise plan , estimate strain patient limit . The use C3 estimation AF future patient decrease trouble loose lead . For reason , use C3 also simplify work healthcare personnel attachment procedure . Overall may lead increase quality well increase capacity examine cardiac arrhythmia cardiology ambulatory .</detailed_description>
