	<brief_summary>Squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) frequent form head neck cancer . The therapeutic choice depend stage disease habit medical team . Surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy use , alone combine . However , none exist strategy prove superiority . Chemotherapy radiotherapy induce DNA damage tumor cell . However , cell ability induce DNA reparation , capable cause treatment resistance . DNA reparation non-tumor tissue also explain toxicity cancer treatment . Investigation DNA repair pathway involve chemo- radiation resistance could offer good strategy identify biomarkers indicator treatment response . This study explore capacity comprehensive functional approach address several pathway , base use three innovative patent technology , classify tumor response HNSCC patient treatment accord DNA Repair Enzyme Signature . Our hypothesis take account various clinical parameter ( e.g . patient tumor characteristic ) , treatment strategy measure DNA Repair Enzyme Signature would create patient ' profile optimize management .</brief_summary>
