	<brief_summary>Despite worldwide effort promote HIV Counseling Testing ( HCT ) , rate test remain low . Understanding high risk group decide test adapt available test option preference potential broadly improve HCT uptake cost-effectiveness . This study propose use Discrete Choice Experiment , survey method increasingly use health economist design patient-centered health care option , rigorously quantify HIV test preference among two high-risk population , identify preferred testing option , evaluate , pragmatic randomize control trial ( RCT ) , effect preference-based HIV counseling test ( PB-HCT ) intervention test uptake . At time heighten focus health preference research patient-centered care , study evaluate critical link preference-based intervention design efficacy . If RCT indicate PB-HCT increase test rate , test option evaluate R01 offer high-risk population study area , preference elicitation method tool use inform design test option well match preference high-risk population setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Preference-based HIV Testing Increase Uptake High Risk Populations ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV counsel test ( HCT ) highly cost-effective intervention increase serostatus awareness , point entry HIV care treatment , important mean primary secondary HIV prevention . Public health official call dramatic increase HIV test achieve HIV-free generation . Yet , test rate plateauing rate repeat-testing among ongoing risk remain low . Thus , need good understand address deterrent HIV test . Evaluations population preference test typically focus acceptability specific venue-based testing option , home-based , provider-initiated , workplace testing , usually without consideration offer option . Results assessment probe potential diversity test preference target population ; ascertain individual value diverse characteristic test option ; identify combination test option could maximize uptake testing . The investigator posit systematically design HIV test intervention , match specifically heterogeneous preference diverse target population , hold potential greatly improve uptake testing . In study investigator extend use DCE method design HIV test intervention match specific preference two high-risk population establish , pragmatic randomize controlled trial , whether Preference-Based HIV Counseling Testing ( PB-HCT ) intervention increase uptake HIV test . In short , investigator adapt concept health behavioral economics , marketing , patient-centered care apply groundbreaking , client-focused perspective context HIV testing . This application address follow Specific Aims : Aim 1 . Quantitatively describe HIV test preference two high-risk population . Hypothesis : HIV test preference differ different high-risk population . The investigator develop conduct DCE survey 200 female barworkers 200 male Kilimanjaro mountain porter , two high HIV risk population Moshi , Tanzania , order describe preference actionable characteristic HIV test option . DCEs quantify relative importance characteristic home-based vs. facility-based testing , venipuncture vs. finger prick vs. oral swab , individual vs. couple counsel , weekday vs. weekend test , availability service health check-ups , individual ' testing decision . Aim 2 . Compare HIV test preference within high-risk population characteristic exist test option identify feasible , preferred alternative . Hypothesis : Multiple distinct feasible test option identify predict well match preference high-risk population . The investigator use latent class analysis DCE choice data Aim 1 identify distinct set test preference within high-risk population . Comparisons risk group 's preference characteristic exist test option use identify , separately group , set two feasible new test option , variation exist test option , predict prefer whose uptake evaluate randomize control trial ( RCT ) Aim 3 . Aim 3 . Conduct RCT evaluate whether HIV test intervention , design match test preference two high-risk population , increase test uptake relative default option . Hypothesis : A preference-based HCT intervention increase uptake test . Representative sample 600 female barworkers 600 male mountain porter randomize two group . Group A participant offer set predict more-preferred PB-HCT option identify Aim 2 default option ; Group B participant offer equal number predict less-preferred option default option . Uptake test cost-effectiveness PB-HCT assess 6 12 month . The finding project significant public health relevance . The propose study ) rigorously characterize HIV test preference two high-risk population ; b ) identify feasible HIV test intervention predict increase HCT uptake ; c ) identify effect preference-informed HIV test intervention rate test . More generally , study evaluate critical link intervention systematically design match population 's preference efficacy intervention . If successful , preference assessment among small sample key population could use widely implementation research tool inform design diverse HIV prevention , test , treatment intervention ; preference-informed intervention , turn , hold potential broadly increase intervention uptake efficacy , internationally United States .</detailed_description>
