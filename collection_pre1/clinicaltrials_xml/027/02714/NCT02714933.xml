	<detailed_description>The potential effect ionize radiation particular concern child . Exposure ionize radiation medical origin responsible increase risk brain tumor hematopoietic lineage child . It therefore necessary find alternative use irradiate imaging examination . Currently , compute tomography ( CT ) gold standard study lung disease use child deepen standard radiography acute chronic situation , sometimes require iterative control . Chest CT delivers radiation dose equivalent 500 day natural exposure . Moreover , analysis mediastinal vascular structure require intravenous injection iodinate contrast , potentially source nephrotoxicity anaphylactic reaction . Recently , new development Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) show interest study lung diseases responsible fill aeric structure ( mucoid impaction cystic fibrosis , alveolar fill infectious process tumor ) analysis vascular mediastinal structure heart . However , aerate lung present low density proton , MRI particularly sensitive artifact cardiac respiratory movement , sequence currently use MRI remain insufficient analysis pulmonary structure pathologic condition fill aeric space ( bronchial , cystic , emphysematous interstitial disease ) . The aim study test clinical practice , new MRI sequence visualize lung parenchyma , 3D zero Time Echo ( Advanced ZTE ) propose protocol combine several MRI sequence without injection alternative chest CT without contrast medium injection childhood . The proposed hypothesis : 1 . MRI sequence Advanced ZTE allow visualization normal pathological lung parenchymal structure . 2 . A complete MRI protocol , without injection , include sequence already use clinical practice could replace enhanced CT pediatric indication . The principal objective study evaluate Advanced ZTE sequence visualization lung parenchyma structure comparison CT scan lung window gold standard .</detailed_description>
