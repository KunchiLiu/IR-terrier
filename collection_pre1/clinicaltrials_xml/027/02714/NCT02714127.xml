	<detailed_description>In total 100 woman include trial , woman diagnose abnormal cytology result and/or high risk HPV ( Human Papillomavirus ) infection schedule colposcopy exam . These woman ask collect first-void urine sample Colli-PeeTM device , prior colposcopy exam clinic . The collected urine sample use development optimisation robust analytical protocol first-void urine sample preparation biomarker assay . During colposcopy , cervix visually inspect , whether combine biopsy histological confirmation . Colposcopy procedure identify abnormality use colposcope give illuminate , magnify view cervical region . It often include rinse cervicovaginal region 50 ml acetic acid ( 5 % ) . Here , fluid collect serve intermediate step biomarkers cervicovaginal secretion urine .</detailed_description>
