	<detailed_description>Individuals United States consume substantial proportion total energy add sugar . The consumption caloric sweetener steadily increase last four decade . The potential health consequence practice subject considerable debate . In prospective follow-up study 43,960 African American woman give complete dietary weight information free diabetes baseline , incidence type 2 diabetes mellitus high high intake sugar-sweetened soft drink fruit drink . Similar conclusion draw meta- analysis 11 study consumption sugar-sweetened beverage relation risk metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes . Thus , addition weight gain , high consumption sugar-sweetened beverage associate development metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes . These finding support current dietary guideline encourage consumer limit intake added sugar . There need sugar substitute safe , palatable favorable effect energy metabolism overall glucose homeostasis . One sugar possibly D-allulose also refer literature D-psicose . D-allulose non-calorie monosaccharide approximately 70 % sweetness sucrose . Early clinical trial D-allulose demonstrate anti-diabetic anti-obesity effect carry Kagawa ( Japan ) . As date , still insufficient data confirm efficacy pure D-allulose Caucasian African American population . The present proposal address efficacy D-allulose reduce postprandial blood glucose level random sample Caucasian African American population . This single center , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study evaluate efficacy pure D-allulose Caucasian African American population . Subjects control study sequentially effect vary amount D-allulose give random order glycemic insulin excursion associate standardized oral sucrose load 50 gm .</detailed_description>
