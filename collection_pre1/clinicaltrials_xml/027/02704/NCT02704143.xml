	<detailed_description>Although incidence rate pancreatic cancer high gastrointestinal carcinoma China , cancer mortality males female rank sixth seventh respectively 2013 , surprise low 5-year survival rate ( &lt; 5 % ) . Only 15 % -20 % patient suitable surgery among first diagnose pancreatic cancer 5-year survival rate patient R0 resection still less 20 % . Therefore , good efficacy available via surgery alone result great emphasis adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . In 1997 , gemcitabine confirm standard chemotherapy pancreatic cancer . However , prove gemcitabine significantly improve prognosis long term follow-up patient refractory gemcitabine . Hence , development effective chemotherapy urgent . S-1 prodrug 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , comprise tegafur , gimeracil ( dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor ) oteracil ( inhibitor phosphorylation gastrointestinal tract ) ratio 1:0.4:1 . The first phase II clinical trial show good clinical efficacy S-1.Moreover , Ueno et al . identify well objective response rate S-1 gemcitabine . Besides , S-1 inferior gemcitabine regard overall survival rate progression free survival rate . And significant improvement progression free survival rate achieve combination S-1 gemcitabine . There difference incidence rate adverse effect S-1 gemcitabine , gastrointestinal toxicity S-1 hematologic toxicity gemcitabine . Therefore , S-1 alternative treat locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer , especially resistant gemcitabine . Although phase III study S-1 , phase II study already show good disease control rate ( 52 % -58 % ) , median overall survival time ( 4.5-6.3 month ) tolerable adverse effect advance pancreatic cancer resistant gemcitabine treat S-1 . Though S-1 appropriate advance pancreatic cancer , superior gemcitabine respect clinical efficacy . In addition , few encouraging result gain combination S-1 drug . As result , S-1 combine radiotherapy gradually apply treatment pancreatic cancer . 5-FU proved radiosensitive thus improve clinical efficacy . S-1 combined radiotherapy demonstrate good prognosis median overall survival time 12.9-16.8 month . Furthermore , patient operable S-1 radiotherapy . Compared conventional radiation , single-fraction dose total dose target volume increase stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . In addition , dos organ risk would reduce , thus effectively improve local control rate reduce radiation relate toxicity . Shorter course SBRT also enhance patient ' compliance render initial treatment schedule possible . Nevertheless , study focus S-1 combined SBRT locally advance pancreatic cancer . Hence , efficacy combination S-1 SBRT need confirm . Based experience treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer , SBRT combine S-1 initial treatment locally advance pancreatic cancer propose evaluate clinical efficacy . Study Procedure : 1 . CyberKnife SBRT body fixation ( vacuum-bag ) use immobilize body , arm legs . Patients undergo plain CT well enhance pancreatic parenchymal CT radiation treatment plan target delineation . 2 . SBRT deliver CyberKnife Synchrony Respiratory Tracking system . The tumor track implanted fiducial marker Fiducial Tracking System . Treatment deliver 5 fraction within 1 2 week discretion investigator . 3 . A body fixation ( vacuum-bag ) use immobilize body , arm ( arm along body ) legs . 4 . The total dos depend patient ' medical condition , range 32.5Gy-45Gy/5Fx . 5 . Patients receive 80 mg S-1 per square meter body surface area twice day 4 week , follow 2 week rest one course.The initiation S-1 within 1 month SBRT .</detailed_description>
