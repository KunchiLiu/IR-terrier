	<brief_summary>The purpose single-blinded , randomized clinical trial determine effectiveness dry needling compare standard shoulder rehabilitation program range motion , functional movement , pain patient undergone shoulder stabilization surgery . Measurements aforementioned dependent variable take time interval four week , eight week , 12 week , six month post-operatively . It hypothesize inclusion dry needle result increase range motion , increase functional movement , decrease pain accelerate rate compare rehabilitation alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methodology /Technical Approach 30-50 subject least four week shoulder stabilization surgery randomize two group ( one experimental group one control group ) . Subjects experimental group receive Trigger Point Dry Needling ( TDN ) intervention standard rehabilitation protocol ( Appendix A ) subject control group receive standard rehabilitation protocol without TDN . The experimental group receive trigger point dry needle one time per week four six week addition standard rehabilitation protocol . The control group receive standard rehabilitation protocol . Baseline measurement take approximately four week post operatively , subsequent measurement record eight week , 12 week , six month . All patient undergone shoulder stabilization procedure invite participate . Description study inform consent take place prior randomization . Concealed randomization take place 0-7 day post-operatively . At 4 week post-operatively , follow assessment test undertake : supine shoulder flexion , supine shoulder external rotation , supine shoulder internal rotation , functional movement testing , functional outcome measure , numeric pain rating scale . 1,2,3 Those subject 'experimental group ' receive manual palpation upper quarter muscle , include cervical thoracic spine region , detect presence myofascial trigger point ( TPs ) . Dry needle perform detected TPs provider train experienced TDN . In addition TDN intervention , experimental group subject undergo rehabilitation program accordance shoulder stabilization repair protocol standard care surgical procedure . Per shoulder stabilization protocol , subject instruct home exercise plan ( HEP ) reinforce clinical treatment , provide handout instruction , require demonstrate exercise correctly . Subjects 'control group ' undergo rehabilitation program describe 'experimental group ' , except receive TDN intervention . Objectives : 1 . To determine addition upper quarter TDN rehabilitation protocol effective improving range motion functional movement compare rehabilitation protocol alone shoulder stabilization surgery . 2 . To determine addition upper quarter TDN rehabilitation protocol effective decreasing pain rehabilitation protocol alone shoulder stabilization surgery .</detailed_description>
