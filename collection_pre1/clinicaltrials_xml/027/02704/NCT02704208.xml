	<detailed_description>The `` Thrive Me '' ( TWM ) intervention technology-delivered peer-to-peer social support intervention ground Information , Motivation , Behavioral Skills ( IMB ) model HIV positive men sex men ( MSM ) . In addition asynchronous peer-to-peer support capability , TWM intervention provide participant Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART ) adherence self-monitoring tool , medication dose reminder , HIV-related informational content . Based encouraging finding TWM pilot study ( complete 2011 ) need novel , evidence-based effective ART adherence intervention , propose follow study aim full-scale RCT . Primary aim ( Aims 1 2 ) examine efficacy online mobile-enabled TWM intervention full-scale randomize controlled trial . HIVpositive adult ( men sex men [ MSM ] ) detectable HIV viral load ( VL ) reside New York City randomize receive TWM intervention information-only HIV/ART intervention 6-month period . Recruitment stratify recent drug use , half report recent illicit drug use . HIV VL , validate self-reported ART adherence , intervention utilization measure collect baseline , post-intervention , 6- , 12- month follow .
