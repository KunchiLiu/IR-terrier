	<brief_summary>One effective strategy decrease radiation exposure ureteroscopy use low dose . However , quality image obtain inferior full dose image . The main concern maintain stone free complication rate despite inferior quality image obtain . Our aim evaluate reduce dose fluoroscopy ¼ instead full dose would impact reduction total radiation exposure despite possible increase fluoroscopy time . Also , strategy would impact operation time , stone free rate complication rate unilateral semi-rigid ureteroscopy ureteral stone treatment due less optimal fluoroscopy image . All patient 18 year old diagnose ureteral stone 5 mm 20 mm diameter CT scan counsel regard treatment option . Patients fail spontaneous passage medical treatment choose endourologic treatment include study . Patients abnormal urinary anatomy horseshoe kidney , pelvic kidney duplex system exclude study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several study support association increase cancer risk increase exposure radiation . Typical radiation exposure patient submit ureteroscopy range 2.5 100 mSv . The International Commission Radiological Protection recommend annual occupational radiation exposure limit 50 mSv per year . One effective strategy decrease radiation exposure ureteroscopy use low dose . However , quality image obtain inferior full dose image . The main concern maintain stone free complication rate despite inferior quality image obtain . Our aim evaluate reduce dose fluoroscopy ¼ instead full dose would impact reduction total radiation exposure despite possible increase fluoroscopy time . Also , strategy would impact operation time , stone free rate complication rate unilateral semi-rigid ureteroscopy ureteral stone treatment due less optimal fluoroscopy image .
