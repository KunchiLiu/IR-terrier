	<brief_summary>The last decade see progressive advance RT delivery , intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) image-guided radiation therapy ( IGRT ) , allow highly precise radiation dose delivery . Together , IMRT IGRT offer potential selective treatment primary tumour surround neck node reduce dose inflict critical organ risk without compromise tumour dose . IMRT show significantly decrease radiation-induced toxicity , consider standard treatment H &amp; N tumor . With advance delivery technology , accurate definition target emerge weak link radiotherapeutic treatment chain . Accurate target definition primary link subsequent treatment planning delivery depend therefore critical successful RT . Incorrect target definition result poorer outcomes either less tumour control , normal tissue toxicity , . Computed x-ray tomography ( CT ) standard volumetric image modality RT high resolution , accurate definition anatomy intrinsic measure electron density necessary accurate dose calculation . However , ability distinguish tumour normal tissue limit due lack contrast structure similar electron density image artifacts object high density . This additional noise result large inter-observation variability . Disease visible endoscopy contour registered planning CT , allow inclusion superficial disease invisible volumetric CT image dataset treatment plan .</brief_summary>
