	<brief_summary>Regional lymph node metastasis major determinant local recurrence overall survival rate patient colorectal cancer . Because poor prognosis associate presence lymph node metastasis , stage III colorectal cancer patient receive adjuvant treatment chemo / radiation therapy accord site tumor . Several author investigate use reveal solution lymph node clearance colorectal cancer . Most study compare conventional histopathological specimen examination lymph node clearing technique show use reveal solution increase mean number lymph node harvest , usually statistically significant manner . It still controversial impact use reveal solution upstage lymph node status consequently indication adjuvant therapy . Therefore conduct randomized clinical trial compare performance GEWF Carnoy solution histopathological examination patient colorectal cancer . The aim study determine lymph node reveal solution best performance ( increase mean number lymph node harvest lymph node upstage ) patient colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing Carnoy 's GEWF Solutions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal adenocarcinoma patient , consecutively submit surgical treatment perform colorectal surgeon 10 year professional experience Hospital Moinhos de Vento ( Porto Alegre , Brazil ) , surgical specimen subject conventional anatomopathological examination analysis lymph node ( visual palpation ) perform highly qualified pathology technician lymph node clearing technique . The lymph node identify preliminary examination count submit pathologic examination hematoxylin eosin stain lymph node metastasis pathologist 10 year experience . Upon complete procedure patient colon cancer , rectal cancer randomize surgical specimen submit lymph node clearing technique Carnoy 's GEWF solution , accord group . 1 . Colon Cancer Group - Carnoy Procedure : The surgical resection specimen embed plastic container 1000 ml Carnoy solution 24 48 hour . Carnoy 's solution fixative compose 60 % ethanol , 30 % chloroform 10 % glacial acetic acid . Following , technician pathological macroscopy 10 year experience perform visual manual assessment additional lymph node 60 minute . Each additional lymph node identify entirely partially embed , depend size , paraffin subsequently stain hematoxylin-eosin.The microscopic examination slide obtain anatomopathological examination Carnoy 's solution perform two pathologist seven 25 year experience , respectively , wide experience lymph node clearing technique . 2 . Colon Cancer Group - GEWF Procedure : The surgical resection specimen embed plastic container 1000 ml GEWF solution 24 48 hour . GEWF solution fixative compose 62.5 % ethanol , 21.25 % distilled water , 10 % formaldehyde 6.25 % glacial acetic acid . Following , technician pathological macroscopy 10 year experience perform visual manual assessment additional lymph node 60 minute . Each additional lymph node identify entirely partially embed , depend size , paraffin subsequently stain hematoxylin-eosin . The microscopic examination slide obtain anatomopathological examination Carnoy 's solution perform two pathologist seven 25 year experience , respectively , wide experience lymph node clearing technique . 3 . Rectal Cancer Group - Carnoy Procedure : The surgical resection specimen embed plastic container 1000 ml Carnoy solution 24 48 hour . Carnoy 's solution fixative compose 60 % ethanol , 30 % chloroform 10 % glacial acetic acid . Following , technician pathological macroscopy 10 year experience perform visual manual assessment additional lymph node 60 minute . Each additional lymph node identify entirely partially embed , depend size , paraffin subsequently stain hematoxylin-eosin.The microscopic examination slide obtain anatomopathological examination Carnoy 's solution perform two pathologist seven 25 year experience , respectively , wide experience lymph node clearing technique . 4 . Rectal Cancer Group - GEWF Procedure : The surgical resection specimen embed plastic container 1000 ml GEWF solution 24 48 hour . GEWF solution fixative compose 62.5 % ethanol , 21.25 % distilled water , 10 % formaldehyde 6.25 % glacial acetic acid .
