	<brief_summary>Problems sleep common exposure highly threatening experience occur without diagnosis posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Established treatment PTSD limit address insomnia many insomnia treatment appear limited context PTSD . Suvorexant FDA approve insomnia among approved drug unique mechanism action may well suit targetting arousal night dysregulated trauma . The investigator evaluate efficacy suvorexant insomnia develop relation trauma exposure , utilize placebo control , polysomnography identify biomarkers response , six week trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disturbed sleep one common distress response exposure severe trauma persist many affect without accompany posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Insomnia risk factor many condition prevalent trauma-exposed population include PTSD , depression , physical health condition obesity , cardiovascular disease . Trauma-related insomnia ( TRI ) typically differentiated study characterize insomnia treatment , insomnia accompany PTSD show relatively refractory treatment establish PTSD . Thus treatment TRI present unmet need implication large grow group people expose trauma term relieve distress prevent psychiatric medical morbidity . Most data TRI come research population PTSD . Difficulty initiate maintain sleep designate one heighten arousal symptom PTSD DSM . Sleep study suggest increased wake sleep onset ( WASO ) , reduce slow wave sleep ( SWS ) PTSD population fragment rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep PTSD developing , acute stage . Suvorexant first class orexin antagonist approve FDA indication insomnia . Orexin antagonists dampen activity specific arousal enhance system brain sleep . In rodent model suvorexant show enhance , healthy human , affect slow wave REM activity ( contrast traditional hypnotic diminish ) . Reducing arousal sleep reduce WASO maintain REM slow wave sleep promise profile treatment TRI . We therefore propose placebo control evaluation ass efficacy suvorexant treat TRI without PTSD tolerability population . We include polysomnography ( PSG ) order objective sleep outcome probe potential mechanism biomarkers predict response . The propose study meet objective test follow hypothesis : Objective . To evaluate efficacy suvorexant participant meet criterion insomnia identify severely threatening event ( DSM criterion A trauma ) precipitant factor significantly exacerbate sleep disturbance . The investigator hypothesize suvorexant improve subjective objective index sleep disturbance ; specifically , primary outcome polysomnographic ( PSG ) measure sleep efficiency increase group receive suvorexant compare group receive placebo . The effect suvorexant versus placebo secondary outcome measure Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) score co-occurring symptom PTSD also evaluate . Exploratory analysis include comparison response pattern among versus without significant symptom PTSD relationship increase slow wave rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep improvement ISI score PTSD symptom . Adverse experience tolerability suvorexant recruit population TRI also evaluate .</detailed_description>
