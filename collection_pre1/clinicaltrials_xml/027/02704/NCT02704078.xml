	<brief_summary>Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Transbronchial Needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA ) firmly establish modality diagnostic evaluation mediastinal lesion . The procedure routinely perform Department Pulmonary Medicine Sleep Disorders , AIIMS , New Delhi since 2012 . Transesophageal approach fine needle aspiration mediastinal lesion use Endobronchial Ultrasound ( EBUS ) scope [ also describe Transesophageal Bronchoscopic Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle aspiration ( EUS-B-FNA ) ] ( also routinely perform department ) describe safe efficacious modality . EUS-B-FNA usually employ EBUS-TBNA feasible excessive cough secretion necessitate switch esophageal route . We hypothesize EUS-B-FNA primary approach similar diagnostic performance EBUS-TBNA associate great patient operator rat procedure comfort lesser requirement anaesthesia medication evaluation patient mediastinal lesion easily accessible either two approach . We propose undertake prospective randomize comparison Transesophageal ( EUS-B-FNA ) versus Transtracheal ( EBUS-TBNA ) approach fine needle aspiration use EBUS scope patient refer endo-sonographic evaluation mediastinal lesion . A total 100 serial patient ( Subcarinal and/or Lower Left paratracheal locate mediastinal lymphadenopathy least &gt; 1cm Short axis diameter ) shall include . After consent preliminary investigation , patient shall randomize equally two approach . Procedure perform local anaesthesia ( topical lignocaine ) i.v . sedation ( midazolam fentanyl ) bronchoscopy laboratory . The primary objective comparison proportion diagnostic adequate aspirate two group . Secondary objective include operator rat cough ( VAS ) , Overall operator rat procedure comfort ( VAS ) , dose midazolam fentanyl administer total procedure duration.The primary data analysis shall performance characteristic primary approach . All aspirate shall analyse pathologist final interpretation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary objective : Comparison Diagnostic accuracy EUS-B-FNA versus EBUS-TBNA primary approach mediastinal fine needle aspiration Convex probe EBUS . Secondary objectives 1 . Topical Anaesthetic requirement two group 2 . Intravenous Sedative / analgesic requirement two group 3 . Operator rat overall comfort procedure ( VAS ) 4 . Operator rat cough two procedure ( VAS ) 5 . Overall duration procedure Methods Study Design : Prospective randomise study . Sample Size : Number Patients : 100 ( 50 -EBUS-TBNA arm , 50- EUS-B-FNA arm ) Inclusion criterion : - Age 18 year Older - Patients predominant Subcarinal Lower Left paratracheal locate mediastinal lymphadenopathy/mediastinal lesion least &gt; 1cm Short axis diameter . - Patients give consent . Exclusion criterion : - Refusal consent procedure - Any contraindication Bronchoscopy Endobronchial Ultrasound procedures - Pregnancy Controls : None For patient , targeted history obtain screen diabetes mellitus , systemic hypertension , bleed disorder , cardiac disease , previous anaesthetic complication medication history include antiplatelet therapy . Baseline investigation like complete hemogram prothrombin time do , image prior procedure include chest radiograph compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest ( plain contrast enhance ) . The patient randomise 2 group 50 patient . 50 patient one group undergo Transtracheal ( EBUS-TBNA ) approach , whereas group , 50 patient undergo Transesophageal ( EUS-B-FNA ) route primary approach use EBUS scope . Procedures perform moderate sedation . Procedures perform Bronchoscopy Lab . The size characteristic mediastinal lymph node visualise EBUS/EUS record . The concerned mediastinal lymph node sample EBUS-TBNA/EUS-FNA direct ultrasonic visualisation . The aspirate express slide place alcohol cytology bottle . The slide dispatch Cytopathology Lab appropriate stain analysis . Lymph node core obtain send formalin Histopathological analysis . Post procedure , patient remain observation hour discharge day . A patient proforma complete patient separately . The size station sample node record . The total duration procedure , nature total dose anaesthesia sedation also record . A Visual-analogue scale ( VAS ) use ass operator rat procedure relate cough overall operator rat comfort procedure . Statistical Analysis - Descriptive statistic mean , median , standard deviation range calculate continuous variable . Frequency distribution calculate qualitative data . Frequency data across categorical variable compare use chi-square fisher 's exact test . Among patient adequate sample EBUS-TBNA/EUS-B-FNA , sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positive negative predictive value calculate use standard formula . P-value P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
