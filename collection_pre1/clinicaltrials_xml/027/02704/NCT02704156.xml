	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Five-fraction Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although incidence rate pancreatic cancer high gastrointestinal carcinoma China , cancer mortality males female rank sixth seventh respectively 2013 , surprise low 5-year survival rate ( &lt; 5 % ) . Only 15 % -20 % patient suitable surgery among first diagnose pancreatic cancer 5-year survival rate patient R0 resection still less 20 % . Therefore , good efficacy achieve via surgery alone , result promotion adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . In America , accept standard treatment contribute improve overall survival rate compare surgery alone . Benefits treatment also prove European study . However , adjuvant chemoradiotherapy indicate 21 % -35 % patient due high postoperative complication rate worse recovery . Additionally , postoperative chemoradiotherapy would delay initial time intensified chemotherapy , along difficulty target volume delineation low tolerance dos organs risk . As result , great emphasis place neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , predominant feature accurate target volume delineation , low complication rate organs risk , low tumor load surgery prevention delay postoperative treatment . Therefore , inappropriate locally advanced pancreatic cancer patient ( 30 % -80 % ) surgery operate via neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Nevertheless , long duration conventional radiotherapy result delay thereafter treatment . Compared conventional radiation , single-fraction dose total dose target volume increase stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . In addition , dos organ risk would reduce , thus effectively improve local control rate reduce radiation relate toxicity . Shorter course SBRT also enhance patient ' compliance render initial treatment schedule possible . Pollom et al . demonstrate significant difference find six-month one-year overall survival rate single-fraction SBRT multi-fraction SBRT . However , potential trend indicate prolonged overall survival patient receive multifractions . Moreover , incidence gastrointestinal toxicity high single-fraction SBRT due high dos . Therefore , multi-fraction SBRT common pancreatic cancer treatment . To best knowledge , study pancreatic cancer SBRT treatment , study retrospective small patient population . Therefore , investigator propose conduct phase II study : five-fraction SBRT initial treatment locally advance pancreatic cancer . Whether patient would receive thereafter treatment , include chemotherapy surgery , depend medical condition . Study Procedure : 1 . CyberKnife SBRT body fixation ( vacuum-bag ) use immobilize body , arm legs . Patients undergo plain CT well enhance pancreatic parenchymal CT radiation treatment plan target delineation . 2 . SBRT deliver CyberKnife Synchrony Respiratory Tracking system . The tumor track implanted fiducial marker Fiducial Tracking System . Treatment deliver 5 fraction within 1 2 week discretion investigator . 3 . A body fixation ( vacuum-bag ) use immobilize body , arm ( arm along body ) legs . 4 . The total dos depend patient ' medical condition , range 32.5Gy-45Gy/5Fx .</detailed_description>
