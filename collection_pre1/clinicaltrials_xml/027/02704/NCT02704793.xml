	<brief_summary>Essential tremor ( ET ) low-mortality , though truly burdensome debilitate condition know second common movement disorder adult population restless legs syndrome . The prevalence disorder age group estimate 0.9 % . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) almost safe technique use diagnosis treatment many neurologic psychiatric condition . Recent study show cerebellum significant role development ET rTMS could exert therapeutic effect motor symptom . In study researcher recruit least 30 subject among patient visit Specialty Clinic Mashhad Medical University accord researcher exclusion inclusion criterion sign write informed consent , randomly assign either real sham rTMS . On real rTMS arm , patient treat 900 pulse 1 Hz rTMS 90 % rest motor threshold ( RMT ) deliver cerebellar hemisphere 5 consecutive day sham treatment perform protocol use small device place TMS coil ( visible patient ) produce electrical stimulation ( le 3 mili ampere ) , simulate sensation real TMS . Subject 's ear protect earplugs real sham stimulation . After 2 month follow-up , patient undergo crossover receive treatment describe . Patients would assess use Fahn-Tolosa-Marin scale baseline day 5 , 12 , 30 real sham treatment session blind researcher . Data analyse another researcher also blind .</brief_summary>
