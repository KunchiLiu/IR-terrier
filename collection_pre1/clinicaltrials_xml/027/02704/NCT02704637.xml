	<brief_summary>HeadSense ( HS ) -1000 device , proprietary non-invasive brain monitor , expect safely accurately monitor physiological sign brain minimal discomfort patient , provide information normal abnormal brain-related condition provide decision-making support physician . The investigator hypothesize HS-1000 capable detect vasospasm use raw acoustic data derive noninvasive procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation Non-invasive Acoustic Approach Detect Monitor Cerebral Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open-label , non-randomized , prospective study patient elevate risk vasospasm stabilize patient treat subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) prevent re-bleeds . Each enrol patient monitor HS-1000 device period 10 minute , occur daily , completion surgery SAH . Following admittance intensive care unit ( ICU ) , patient undergo routine monitoring per standard care . Non-invasive recording 10 minute duration HS-1000 device complete daily 14 day contingent staff availability patient 's clinical status . In event monitoring session interrupt postponed , another attempt re-monitor make patient able . Flexibility grant lieu patient study team unavailability thereby allow record neglected give day absolutely necessary . In case principle investigator ( PI ) member study team positively confirm vasospasm base clinical assessment follow-up care patient monitoring period , patient record twice daily consecutive 14 day duration ICU . The PI determine severity vasospasm per vasospasm severity scale . Increased record frequency implement patient vasospasm grade asymptomatic moderate-to-severe symptomatic mild-to-severe ( i.e . score 2a , 3a , 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Prior HS-1000 recording session , front-end place patient 's ear connect monitor . The acoustic signal propagates cranium , attenuate propagation . The receiving sensor headset pick acoustic signal . The receiving sensor convert acoustical signal digital signal transmits back monitor . Each record session HS-1000 last 10 consecutive minute , patient 's condition clinical workflow permit . If require attend medical staff , record stop restart late time day . The HS-1000 use seamless adjunctive , state-of-the-art , brain monitoring utility operate parallel standard care intensive neurological monitoring modality . The non-invasive monitor replace alter standard care receive patient . Once recording complete , brain monitoring signal save study 's database . Daily neurological check collection routine clinical radiographic data per standard care gather gold standard data statistical comparison . Neurocognitive test perform routinely every 8 hour attend physician assess neuro-deterioration radiological ( Computed tomographic angiography ( CTA ) Digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) component . Data collect patient strip personal health identifier . Each subject receive unique identify patient number link individual deidentified clinical data set . Only medical staff attend patient 's standard care knowledgeable identity subject . Once data collect , result HS-1000 recording session analyze correlate deidentified support clinical/radiological data assist identification vasospasm-specific acoustic waveform pattern . Deidentified support clinical data consist standard care intensive neurological monitoring procedure currently use confirm clinical diagnosis vasospasm , principally base evidence neuro deterioration : 1 . Computed tomographic angiography 2 . Digital subtraction angiography 3 . Neurocognitive clinical assessment 4 . Routine clinical data per standard care Study workflow HS-1000 record session fully compatible alter standard care receive patient way .</detailed_description>
