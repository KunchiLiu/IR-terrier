	<brief_summary>Balance crucial individual 's mobility independence . Human balance achieve maintained complex set sensorimotor system include sensory input vision , proprioception vestibular system ( motion , equilibrium , spatial orientation ) . This information integrate brain . This complexity lead undiagnosed mistreated patient balance disorder long period affect daily activity . The EMBalance project research project fund European Union , involve 10 university across Europe . Its aim create Decision Support System ( DSS ) support doctor diagnose treat balance disorder . It available primary secondary care doctor different specialty , level train different part country . The DSS : - Be use primary secondary health care professional - Assist doctor evaluation management dizzy patient - Predict balance disorder may progress - Reduce patient wait time onward referral - Ensure patient receive prompt efficient treatment plan The EMBalance randomise clinical trial ( RCT ) proof-of-concept , multicentre , single-blind , parallel group study , conduct Belgium , Germany , Greece United Kingdom . At present , question study aim answer whether algorithm develop EMBalance Platform yield meaningful information algorithm platform improve , perform offline comparison classical diagnostic approach outcome EMBalance platform , without consequence patient . Patients present balance relate symptom primary care randomise either intervention group ( non-specialist doctor +DSS ) control group ( non-specialist doctor -DSS ) . An oversee expert confirm diagnosis management decision make non-specialist doctor order determine whether use DSS help precise assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Balance crucial individual 's mobility independence . Dizziness imbalance symptom one common reason visit doctor affect 30-40 % population 60 year age . The healthcare service provision address vestibular pathology remain inadequate regard low priority . The complexity balance control mechanism , lack medical expertise , absence specialise equipment contributory factor mismanagement patient suffer balance disorder . However , mean number patient visit Health Care provider require establish correct diagnosis start appropriate treatment , US UK , 4.5 . The overall socio-economic impact balance disorder affect individual , patient 's family well burden society health service considerable . Advances computer science artificial intelligence allow development computer system support clinical diagnosis therapeutic treatment decision base individualised patient data . However , review exist Decision Support Systems use Medicine demonstrate many successful integrated software system standalone tool address early diagnosis effective management balance disorder . All say , EMBalance DSS develop supplementary supportive tool non-expert physician face challenge address vestibular disorder . The current study ass effectiveness EMBalance Decision Support System ( DSS ) diagnosis management balance disorder feasibility/proof concept study . Patients present balance relate symptom ( specifically vertigo dizziness exacerbate head movement ) primary care , see non-specialist doctor either without support DSS , ratio 1:1 . Non-specialist doctor participate country define follow : - UK : General Practitioners - Germany : Neurology resident - Belgium &amp; Greece : ENT resident Overseeing expert participate country define follow : - UK : Consultant audiovestibular medicine ( AVM ) - Germany : Neurologist - Belgium &amp; Greece : ENT specialist &gt; 10 year expertise AVM/Neuro-otology It anticipate 100 participant recruit two treatment group , give total 200 participant across Europe . Each participate site Greece , Belgium , Germany United Kingdom recruit 50 patient . Allocation perform base randomisation table produce advance centre . Statistical data analysis perform National Kapodistrian University Athens . The statistical analysis develop National Kapodistrian University Athens review Institute Communication Computer Science ( Greece ) .
