	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . Identification characterization ovarian carcinoma well-known biomarkers , carcinoma antigen 125 ( CA125 ) Human epididymis protein 4 ( HE4 ) potential biomarkers vaginal fluid obtain ovarian cancer patient . 2 . Quantification calibration identify biomarkers vaginal discharge collect ovarian cancer patient comparison sample collect healthy volunteer . 3 . Comparison analysis biomarkers level vaginal fluid vs. serum . 4 . Quantification calibration identify biomarkers vaginal discharge collect ovarian cancer patient diagnose various stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Characterization Ovarian Cancer Endometrial Cancer Specific Biomarkers Vaginal Fluids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initially , twenty vaginal fluid sample collect ovarian cancer patient diagnose epithelial ovarian carcinoma advance diagnosis stage . The sample use identify specific biomarkers describe . Biomarkers level calibrate compare vaginal fluid obtain healthy volunteer . In addition , five milliliter venous blood collect patient order compare biomarkers vaginal fluid level vs serum level . All patient sign consent form approve vaginal fluid sample utilize research accord Helsinki approval . At second phase research , additional twenty vaginal fluid sample collect patient diagnosed different stage ( five sample main stage 1-4 ) . Sample use calibrate biomarkers level various diagnosis stage compare serum level venous blood sample also collect patient . All patient sign consent form follow explanation research goal . Patient notify participation research implication medical treatment plan . Note research phase return sample patient , identification characterization procedure perform vitro research property . Methodology - Collecting vaginal fluid sample ovarian cancer patient . Vaginal fluid ( least 400µl , investigator wish 1000 µl ) collect surgery routine physical examination use specific applicator/cotton swab/syringe . Samples ship GinaLife Diagnostics laboratory analysis . In addition , day vaginal fluid collection 5 ml peripheral blood sample draw volunteer . - Analyzing specific biomarkers sample . Vaginal fluid analyze use commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit determine presence concentration various protein . In addition , western blot analysis use order confirm ELISA assay result . Specific nucleic acid determine use common molecular method Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) etc . - Data analysis</detailed_description>
