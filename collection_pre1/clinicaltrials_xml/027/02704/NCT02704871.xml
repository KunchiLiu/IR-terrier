	<brief_title>The Ward Study SeptiCyte® Lab Distinguish Between Infection-positive Infection-negative SIRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate molecular diagnostic device develop distinguish sepsis infection-negative SIRS among critically ill patient . This study prospective , non-randomized , non-interventional , observational trial patient suspect sepsis medical and/or surgical ward . The study conduct two preselected patient care unit . All patient identify local screen tool undergo physician review . If suspicion sepsis find plausible , routine conventional diagnostic procedure , include : routine blood , blood culture specialize test conduct . Blood collection SeptiCyte® Lab SeptID® drawn within 6 hour positive screen - use peripheral blood clinical sample . The diagnostic performance two experimental assay compare Retrospective Physician Diagnosis ( RPD ) , conventional microbiological culture . The result SeptiCyte® Lab SeptID® use clinical decision-making . This data use analyze performance SeptiCyte® Lab accord endpoint measure .</detailed_description>
