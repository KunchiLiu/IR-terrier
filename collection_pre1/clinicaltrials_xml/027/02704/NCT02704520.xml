	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Tumour Regression Grade Biomarker Stratified Management Rectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately half patient diagnosed rectal cancer offer chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment ( CRT ) surgery . There great variability tumour respond CRT . Approximately 30 % tumour completely respond cancer cell find cancer specimen remove surgery . Other tumours respond occasionally continue grow treatment . In many hospital patient receive MRI scan CRT treatment . Emerging evidence suggest view MRI scan smarter way assess 'mrTRG ' ( MR Tumour Regression Grade ) possible assess tumour respond treatment . The TRIGGER Trial aim evaluate mrTRG tool stratify patient accord response treatment . Patients randomise ( 1:2 ratio ) control intervention arm . Patients control arm receive best current practice surgery 6-8 week CRT standard course chemotherapy . Patients intervention arm receive treatment plan accord response CRT , assess use mrTRG . Patients good response CRT defer surgery cancer stop reduce size avoid surgery altogether cancer detect repeat scan assessment . Patients poor response CRT additional pre-operative chemotherapy . The investigator able see reduces size tumour , decision make proceed surgery , lower risk tumour spreading .</detailed_description>
