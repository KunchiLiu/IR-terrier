	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Implementation Algorithm Enteral Nutrition Support .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The algorithms enteral nutrition support also call protocol develop implement intensive care unit ( ICU ) across world enhance provision calorie proteins via enteral nutrition ( EN ) , increase proportion patient receive optimal amount ( 80-85 % energy protein requirement ) , decrease caloric protein debt . The algorithm include different design intervention , variability design algorithm adapt local necessity . The principal reason algorithm implementation rate underfed ( receive &lt; 80 % prescribed energy protein requirement ) result numerous cause 26 % consider avoidable event , variation clinical practice . There 's universal consensus EN principal artificial way macro-micro nutrient delivery , come novelty `` gut work , use prepare lose '' . The evidence show EN physiological patient receive optimal amount EN clinical outcome ( length hospital stay , mortality infection rate ) decrease significantly . In average 74 % patient ICU receive EN underfed , Mexico 71 % hospitalized patient EN non-critical area underfed , receive 61 % energy requirement hospitalization . The investigator propose algorithm EN support base evidence , order avoid variability prescription include prediction equation accord BMI calculate energy protein requirement . The algorithm propose range initial infusion gastric post-pyloric feeding continuous infusion evaluate tolerability , sign symptom intolerance infusion increase . If subject present intolerability EN ( diarrhea , abdominal distention ) , action algorithm indicate option rather suspension . Moreover EN interrupt reason intolerance patient already reach goal rate compensatory feed table use . As part intervention , several educational session medical , nutritionist nurse staff perform period study . The investigator hypothesize implementation algorithm EN support increase amount energy protein safely effectively patient compare usual practice . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety implementation algorithm EN support ( ASNET ) .</detailed_description>
