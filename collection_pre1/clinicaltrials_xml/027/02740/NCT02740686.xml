	<brief_summary>This study examine inflammatory response exercise encompass part standard pulmonary rehabilitation programme patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Patients split two group , frequent exacerbators infrequent exacerbators , dependent upon exacerbation history compare responses pulmonary rehabilitation amongst phenotype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary rehabilitation proven benefit COPD patient term quality life functional capability . The effect pulmonary rehabilitation ( exercise ) immune function unclear despite clear benefit exercise immune function healthy individual identify . Moderate-intensity frequency exercise show decrease risk upper respiratory tract infection healthy individual comparison sedentary individual . Respiratory infection , also know exacerbation , COPD main cause hospitalisation mortality . Therefore , exercise modulate immune function COPD , encourage COPD reduce hospitalisation risk . However , important compare effect exercise amongst different phenotype frequent exacerbators know elevated inflammatory marker , may consequently respond exercise differently infrequent exacerbators , pave rationale different approach subset patient .</detailed_description>
