	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate whether baseline 18F-sodium fluoride uptake activity aortic valve could predict aortic stenosis progression moderate aortic stenosis . Patients moderate aortic stenosis enrol underwent baseline evaluation include 18F-sodium fluoride PET/CT . After 1 year , participant underwent follow-up echocardiography . The study design observational trial . Primary endpoint change mean pressure gradient along aortic valve assess echocardiography 1 year . Secondary endpoint include change aortic valve area , symptom occurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent study demonstrate 18F-sodium fluoride ( NaF ) uptake activity marker early-stage calcification . Although valve calcification could visualize either echocardiography coronary compute tomography , reflect current burden calcium deposit activity calcium deposit . Limited study exist regard usefulness 18F-NaF uptake aortic valve prediction stenosis progression . Patients moderate aortic stenosis - diagnose echocardiography - enrol . Enrolled participant undergo baseline 18F-NaF PET/CT within 6 week baseline echocardiography follow 1 year . After 1 year , participant require evaluate aortic stenosis progression perform echocardiography . The objective study test whether baseline 18F-NaF uptake activity predict AS progression .</detailed_description>
