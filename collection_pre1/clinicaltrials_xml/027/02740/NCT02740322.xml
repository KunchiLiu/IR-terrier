	<brief_summary>The sensitivity specificity Hum Test investigate 's ability detect conductive hearing loss . The hum test simply elicit ask subject hum second high low pitch comfortable subject . The subject ask hum heard one side ( left right ) , sound equal side . To simulate conductive hearing loss , ear plug place one subject 's ear . We elicit hum test well standard Weber test audiogram across two condition , ear plug without ear plug . From , hop assess Hum Test compare audiogram ( gold standard ) detect conductive hearing loss well compare standard Weber test . If Hum Test demonstrate strong sensitivity specificity detect conductive hearing loss , could application utilized alternative standard Weber test , set formal physical examination may yet possible etiology patient 's hearing change could quickly assess remotely thus urgency intervention/ consultation could determine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validating Hum Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It presume Hum Test work similarly Weber Test , bone conduction skull elicit determine change hear conductive sensorineural nature . Because hum test frequently employ clinical practice yet validation yet demonstrate , investigation warrant . To examine compare Hum Test , Weber Test , audiogram ability detect identify hearing loss , hear loss simulate use ear plug ( mimic conductive hearing loss ) . Subjects serve control test conduct without ear plug . Study data maintain use online , password protect storage system . No identifiable information collect store ( i.e . name , DOB , etc. ) . Limited demographic information collect analysis purpose age gender .</detailed_description>
