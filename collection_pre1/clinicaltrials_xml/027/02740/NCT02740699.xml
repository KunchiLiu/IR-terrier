	<brief_summary>Background : Coronary artery disease cause plaque artery . This cause stroke heart disease . Drugs call statin might shrink plaque . Researchers want study CT scan determine individual arterial plaque decrease take statin . Objectives : To measure change coronary artery plaque volume people treat high-intensity statin therapy use CT MRI scan . To study metabolic activity plaque artery . To determine well plaque measurement heart CT scan replicate . Eligibility : Men age 45-75 woman age 50-75 good candidate statin treatment Design : Visit 1 : participant screen : - Medical history - Blood test - Heart MRI CT scan : An IV insert arm hand vein remove blood injects contrast , medicine need . Participants lie table slide machine take picture body . For CT scan , heart rate high , get medicine low . They breathe special way , hold breath 5 second . Participants begin high-intensity statin treatment . Participants 7 visit 3 year . All visit include blood test medication review . Some may also include : - Statin treatment adjustment - CT scan - MRI scan - Physical exam Participants may join PET Substudy . This include 5 visit study . These include : - Getting IV arm vein - Blood test - PET scan : They fast 12 hour . Participants may join Reproducibility Substudy slow heart rate first CT scan . This include 1 additional heart CT scan 4 week later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In high risk patient undergo invasive angiography , intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) show reduction plaque patient treat HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) . However , accept noninvasive method determine treatment atherosclerosis result reduction coronary artery plaque . Coronary artery CT angiography ( CCTA ) noninvasive accurately determine degree coronary artery stenosis . In addition , extent calcify noncalcified plaque may directly measure use technology low radiation dose use state-of-the-art CT scanner . Several retrospective study previously suggest CCTA may able show plaque regression coronary artery due statin therapy . The primary aim proposal determine change coronary artery plaque volume individual treat high intensity statin therapy define 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline Treatment Blood Cholesterol Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk Adults . Men woman meet inclusion exclusion criterion undergo CCTA examination presence absence coronary artery plaque . Individuals evidence noncalcified coronary plaque CCTA meet criterion HMG-CoA reductase ( statin ) therapy evaluate total 36 month . The change coronary artery plaque ( progression change , regression ) individual noncalcified plaque baseline measure CCTA yearly interval .</detailed_description>
