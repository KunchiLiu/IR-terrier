	<detailed_description>SkinIO early-stage healthcare IT company specialize education , early detection , prevention skin cancer . This study utilize product , skinIO , enhance full-body skin cancer screen system work mobile device tablet track change skin time without additional imaging hardware . skinIO enable dermatology staff photograph high-risk patient 13 medical photography pose quickly capture full-body skin surface multiple resolution use mobile device . These image automatically upload HIPAA-compliant server environment rapidly process detect spot , lesion , mole . Dermatologists able annotate image flag specific image follow-up every month . In order ass whether software accurately detect spot change , investigator test product sample volunteer subject . Part One : The study population undergo one study visit . This visit include 2 set photos take research team collection small amount identify contact information subject . There initial 3-5 photograph take area body least 3 natural artificial skin marking ( ie . mole , angioma , scar , keloid , seborrheic keratosis , small tattoo , etc ) . These marking allow app calculate parameter original lesion , thereby accurately detect new marking change base calculation . Once original photograph take , one individual 's original skin mark enhanced/enlarged mark pen , well 3- 5 new mark add skin . A Sharpie brush tip permanent marker utilize make new skin marking . These marker AP certify non-toxic . The following color choose : orange , black , brown , red , blue , purple , yellow pink . A second photograph take area body chosen initial photograph determine application could detect change . This group image send dermatologist evaluation , artificially produce . Part Two : In order test sensitivity feasibility field use TBDP app , second convenience sample patient recruit . Recruitment do wait room attend physician 's consent . If need , recruitment do outside wait room form flyer , website e-mail announcement . This population consist patient know high risk new/changing lesion , fall within Fitzpatrick skin type I-IV . High risk patient include , limited , dysplastic nevus syndrome , previous history melanoma/non-melanoma skin cancer , fair skin , &gt; 16 nevus , family history melanoma , and/or immunosuppressed status . The first photography session take research team 13 projection . Each projection correspond body area photograph ensure total body photography . After first visit , patient instruct take photograph every month 12 month use TBDP app smart phone tablet , follow-up research appointment every 6 month . The patient provide user guide write instruction application use . The TBDP app built-in reminder system patient . Any change detect app store research team 's database . Standard care follow new/changing lesion . Patients recommend follow-up appointment dermatologist , within 2 week . No procedure complete research team , physician see patient research appointment . During visit , research team compare photograph take TBDP app patient 's skin see sensitive app . Patients continue regular office visit 6 month and/or 12 month per standard care high risk patient . The research team use information chart review assessment outcome new change lesion .</detailed_description>
