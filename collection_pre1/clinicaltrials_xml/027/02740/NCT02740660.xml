	<brief_title>Body Composition Changes With Albuterol Caffeine Versus Placebo Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study do Pennington Biomedical demonstrate equivalent oral albuterol 4mg three time day ( tid ) oral caffeine 100mg tid reduces body fat increase lean tissue rodent addition effect two component separately . The combination albuterol caffeine change body composition without change food intake . An adult male take albuterol 4 mg orally tid plus caffeine 100mg orally tid increase lean mass 1.25 % decreased fat mass 1.2 % two month period . These effect expect even great grow adolescent . This pilot project take first step towards try understand safety potential efficacy drug combination . The prospect use inexpensive medication already approve pediatric population treatment asthma novel treatment adolescent obesity address medical need presently unmet . Food restriction adolescence difficult accomplish , also raise concern growth development . A medication approve treatment obesity adolescent age group improve body composition reduce body fat increase lean tissue without need restrict food intake would useful tool physician address treatment obesity adolescent . Albuterol medication , approve age 6 old , use treatment asthma also show increase muscle strength lean body mass child spinal muscular atrophy healthy young men exercise train program . A drug approve treatment adolescent obesity increase lean tissue , decrease fat tissue give conjunction lifestyle modification would welcome pediatrician treat adolescent adolescent stigmatized obesity . A provisional patent submit Pennington Biomedical Research Center protect combination caffeine albuterol 1:25 ratio synergistically increase muscle mass decrease fat mass potential treatment obesity adolescent . This study double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled , pilot study subject randomize receive either placebo combination Albuterol 4 mg Caffeine 100mg three time per day orally total 8 week . Each subject continue study intervention entire duration treatment</detailed_description>
