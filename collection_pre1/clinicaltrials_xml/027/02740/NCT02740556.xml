	<brief_summary>There limit data outside clinical trial adherence daily ledipasvir/sofosbuvir regimen . Many patient present known barrier medication adherence include untreated psychiatric illness substance use disorder , cognitive impairment , low health literacy . The goal study evaluate baseline level adherence ledipasvir/sofosbuvir real-world clinic population compare level adherence patient provide additional adherence support . Medication adherence study evaluate use AdhereTech , wireless pill monitor device measure dosage time medication take . Using cellular technology , AdhereTech use passively collect data medication take , refill need , often bottle open . AdhereTech also use actively monitor adherence provide feedback subject use device . When actively monitoring , AdhereTech set provide live feedback subject lighting , sound chime , send phone/text/email alert remind patient take medication ( see attach PowerPoint presentation ) . HepCure web-based tool kit form dashboard medical provider ( MDs NPs ) application ( `` app '' ) patient . The app allow patient become active participant treatment enable set medication reminder , record dose take , communicate adherence medical provider use provider dashboard .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : The study conduct two phase follow aim : ( 1 ) To passively assess adherence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) treatment ledipasvir/sofosbuvir use wireless pill monitor device 33 patient ( Phase 1 , month 1-3 ) . ( 2 ) To test impact adherence use active wireless pill monitor device conjunction HepCure web-based tool kit 66 patient ( Phase 2 , month 4-9 ) . Participants phase 2 randomize 1:1 one two condition : ( ) Patients use HepCure patient app link provider use HepCure Provider Dashboard ; AdhereTech passively monitor adherence . ( b ) Patients use HepCure patient app link provider use HepCure Provider Dashboard ; AdhereTech actively monitor adherence ( chimes reminder enable ) . Secondary Objectives : The study design allow u compare additive effect adherence HepCure provider toolkit HepCure provider toolkit + active AdhereTech reminder system . Primary Endpoints : The primary study endpoint take time adherence assess electronic monitoring . There numerous method assess adherence medication . They strengths weakness , feasible research clinical setting . The commonly use method assess adherence ( 1 ) provider assessment , ( 2 ) structure self-report ( 3 ) pharmacy refill data ( 4 ) electronic monitoring ( 5 ) pill count ( 6 ) directly observe therapy . Electronic monitoring technology widely use research study HIV medication adherence regard many accurate method assess medication adherence ( Weiss et al . 2009 ) . In method , medication bottle cap microchip record opening closing bottle . This microchip provide researcher precise record date time bottle opening . This method show closely associated random home pill count ( Bangsberg et al. , 2001a ) , viral suppression ( Bangsberg et al. , 2000 ; Paterson et al. , 2000 ; Arnsten et al. , 2001 ; Walsh et al. , 2002b ; Moss et al. , 2004 ) , drug resistance ( Walsh et al. , 2002b ) . Studies consistently find provider assessment adherence poor ( Bangsberg et al. , 2001b ; Gross et al. , 2002 ; Miller et al. , 2002 ) . Self-reported adherence tends provide over-estimate actual adherence ( Weiss et al . 2009 ) . Pharmacy refill data best employ patient use one pharmacy prescription , pharmacy data easily accessible clinician computer , prescription automatically deliver without patient need request pick . Patients clinical research study often ask bring medication study visit change number pill ( account refill ) since last visit use assess adherence . Potential problem associate announce pill count patient may forget bring medication study visit , nonadherent patient may throw pill prior visit ( `` pill dump '' ) avoid label nonadherent . While directly observe therapy ( DOT ) provide highly accurate assessment adherence , cost intrusiveness observe dos medication ingestion make impractical method ARV adherence assessment , except specific setting ( e.g. , prison nurse home ) .</detailed_description>
