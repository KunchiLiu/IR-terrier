	<brief_summary>Asthma heterogeneous disease , although much understood mechanism inflammation allergic asthma , less know mechanism irritant-induced asthma ( IA ) . Understanding underlying similarity difference mechanisms two type asthma help focus current treatment lead development new therapy . There longstanding NYU/Bellevue Asthma registry ( NYUBAR ) , large population ( N = 900 ) asthma case control , program house CTSI ( formerly GCRC ) . The destruction World Trade Center ( WTC ) result massive dust , gas fume exposures local resident , worker cleanup worker individual involve rescue recovery adverse respiratory health effect disaster report 7 year 9/11 . Many responder , well expose resident local worker , develop IA , asthma arises lag environmental exposure . The WTC Environmental Health Center ( WTC EHC ) one three New York City ( NYC ) WTC Centers Excellence one focus treatment monitor local worker resident . As , large population individual irritant-induced asthma . It propose use participant NYUBAR WTC EHC expand knowledge irritant allergic asthma . Non-invasive study allow assessment airway inflammation , non-specific response environmental exposure injury . Recent technology also allow assessment microRNA ( miRNA ) , small RNAs regulate gene expression post-transcriptional level thus serve pathway regulation inflammation . The hypothesis test airway inflammation irritant allergic asthma may similar , result divergent miRNA regulatory pathway express sputum cell . These study provide preliminary data future study help identify biological pathway categorize asthma phenotype target future treatment intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study two asthma phenotypes one control population . Patients recruit WTC EHC = 30 WTC dust cloud exposure , patient recruit NYUBAR ( n=30 ) asthma define NIH guideline , control patient recruit NYUBAR ( n=30 ) respiratory sx , asthma diagnosis , WTC dust exposure . The study entail two three visit . On visit 1 ( V1 ) individual sign inform consent participate study NYU IRB approve protocol . A questionnaire complete standardized question include information WTC exposures , demographic , presence severity respiratory symptom , tobacco history past medical history . Individuals undergo spirometry inhale bronchodilator . Individuals undergo methacholine challenge test ( visit 1a ) normal spirometry bronchial hyperresponsiveness . On visit 2 , individual return undergo ENO , EBC spirometry pre post bronchodilator maneuver induce sputum . Blood obtain CBC differential cell count , assessment total IgE allergen-specific IgE . Blood also store future analysis inflammatory marker . Based experience , individual unable produce enough sputum thus yield small number cell . These individual exclude data analysis . In addition , also subject able produce sputum return repeat sputum testing .</detailed_description>
