	<brief_title>Xenon-129 Lung Magnetic Resonance Imaging : Study Healthy Volunteers Participants With Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance ( MR ) lung image relatively new image method allow depiction lung function morphology . Hyperpolarized gas new class MR contrast agent , inhale , provide high temporal spatial resolution MR image lung airspace . Since ionize radiation involve , hyperpolarized gas MR image ideal evaluation lung diseases especially child . With hyperpolarized gas , nuclear spin gas atom bring alignment outside MR scanner via process call optical pumping ; yield high polarization permit visualization lung airspace MR imaging ( despite low physical density gas lung ) . Two non-radioactive ( i.e . stable ) isotopes noble gas helium-3 xenon-129 hyperpolarized . Until recently , high polarization could achieve helium-3 xenon-129 , human , helium-3 commonly use hyperpolarized gas MR imaging lung . Recently , technology develop provide large quantity highly polarize xenon-129 . Helium-3 gas also extremely expensive since limited reserve gas , difficult procure research . Unlike helium-3 , since xenon-129 naturally present atmosphere , less expensive easy procure image . Several application xenon-129 MR imaging development , include diffusion-weighted relaxation-weighted imaging . These technique take advantage fact rate loss xenon-129 polarization significantly influence local blood flow concentration molecular oxygen , well restriction xenon-129 diffusion small airway space dimension . These data use create map lung reflect regional ventilation/perfusion micro-airway size . Other data obtain xenon-129 MRI include volume ventilate unventilated lung subsequently analyze determine homogeneity gas distribution within airspace . These data use study structural functional change take place lung associate pulmonary disease like CF asthma . It might provide diagnostic tool able detect pulmonary disease sensitively current gold standard measurement spirometry plethysmography , thus prevent irreparable irreversible damage lung early stage disease .</detailed_description>
