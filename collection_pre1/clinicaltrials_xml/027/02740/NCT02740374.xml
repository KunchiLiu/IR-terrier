	<brief_title>Evaluation Thromboelastometry ( ROTEM ) During Spinal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study method This prospective , randomized parallel-group single center study patient undergo elective major spine surgery . Patients randomize ROTEM-guided hemostatic therapy algorithm standard care hemostatic therapy : arterial blood gas analysis ( ABG ) , normalized index ratio ( INR ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) , thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , hemoglobin ( Hb ) , platelet , fibrinogen . Study Procedures Patients randomize 1:1 ratio either standard care coagulation test ( SOC ) ROTEM . No change surgery anesthesia technique make purpose study . Standard Care Coagulation Tests If patient randomize standard care coagulation test , perform accord Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center standard practice attend 's criterion . Standard care test include limited : hemoglobin , platelet count , fibrinogen concentration , INR , aPTT , PT . These perform fixed time point ( preoperatively , every 2 hour intraoperatively , procedure completion , 24 hour procedure completion ) . Arterial blood gas perform repetitively intraoperative fix range every 1-hour attending 's criterion , well postoperative laboratory test . ROTEM If patient randomized ROTEM , anesthesiologist blind intraoperative conventional coagulation test might perform . ROTEM use accord manufacturer 's instruction , use equipment test reagent provide Tem International GmbH . All test perform bedside clinical perfusionist train perform ROTEM . A specific algorithm create follow accord clinical criterion ROTEM monitoring perform patient sign clinically relevant diffuse bleed blood transfusion consider ( Temp &gt; 35 Celsius degree ; pH low 7.2 ; Cai 4.6 mg/dL ; Hb 9g/dL , 10g/dL anticipate great blood loss ) fix range every 2 hour Anesthesiologist criterion base patient 's clinical situation . PatientÂ´s clinical situation consider important component transfusion decision-making process . Packed erythrocyte transfuse maintain hemoglobin concentration higher 9g/dl high 10g/dl individual underlie cardiovascular disease anticipate great blood loss . Individual base dynamic strongly indicate need erythrocyte transfusion anesthesiologist criterion also part transfusion make decision-making process ( tachycardia , hypotension , sings ischemia electrocardiogram , lactic acidosis , dynamic bleed ) . Assessment report Adverse Events The occurrence adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) record time consent discharge . For AE , relationship study procedure monitoring , severity , expectedness , outcome determine PI record study source accordingly If case subject withdraws study due serious adverse event local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) notify within 10 day .</detailed_description>
