	<detailed_description>Urea cycle disorder ( UCD ) genetic disorder cause liver 's inability breakdown ammonia proteins ; ammonia accumulates toxic brain . UCD cause brain damage intellectual developmental disability even death . Treatment involve special diet low protein , drug help metabolize ammonia amino acid supplement ( conservative management ) . Many patient family choose liver transplantation rather conservative treatment ; alternative effective reduce normalize blood ammonia . While liver transplantation eliminate ammonia problem , conservative management temporarily many patient , blood ammonia rise infection . The long-term objective study help patient make decision management alternative ( conservative vs. liver transplantation ) provide scientific information currently lack . The question investigator address : 1 . What disease 's risk mortality illness two treatment approach ? 2 . What parent expect term development child his/her school performance ? 3 . What expect effect treatment short-term long-term quality life ? This research two component . In one investigator use statistical method compare number percentage survival , illness , psychological testing IQ , executive function , memory , behavior quality life patient choose conservative management choose liver transplantation . Some information already collect Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium ( UCDC ) 14 metabolic clinic ( 11 US ) part long-term follow-up study . To ensure information investigator analyze representative UCD patient population US , investigator also obtain data Studies Pediatric Liver Transplantation ( SPLIT ) registry , collect information child undergo liver transplantation many different disease ( include UCD ) . The second component consist individual interview focus group patient and/or family medical provider determine important issue consider decide whether opt liver transplantation continue conservative management . The National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation ( NUCDF ) Patients ' Research Working Group collaborate clinical investigator design research ensure cover question important patient family . The result study disseminated patient , doctor clinical staff receive current , validated information make decision best treatment .</detailed_description>
