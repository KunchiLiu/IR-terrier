	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , multicenter study continuous oral dose AZD4635 administer single agent combination PD-L1 antibody , durvalumab . The study design allow escalation dose intensive safety monitoring ensure safety patient . The primary objective study determine maximum tolerate dose AZD4635 combination durvalumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Clinical Study AZD4635 Durvalumab Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two segment . The first segment study ( Phase 1a ) dose escalation design order determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) AZD4635 give monotherapy combination durvalumab . The MTD determine assess adverse event incidence abnormal laboratory measure . Once maximum tolerated monotherapy dose AZD4635 determine , combination dose durvalumab start new cohort patient one dose level lower high tolerate dose AZD4635 monotherapy . The combination therapy cohorts Phase 1a also 2-week monotherapy lead-in patient tolerate monotherapy AZD4635 continue twice daily dose AZD4635 combination durvalumab ( anti programmed-death ligand 1 [ PD-L1 ] ) fix dose 1.5 gram IV every 4 week . When maximum-tolerated dose combination set determine , additional patient advance solid malignancy enrol dose expansion portion explore safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , biological activity select dos . Approximately 24 36 patient advance solid malignancy treat Phase 1a . The second segment study ( Phase 1b ) consist additional expansion phase MTD combination approximately 15 patient non-small cell lung cancer previously receive anti-PD-1 therapy , either fail respond progress initial response . At least one cohort study may investigate preliminary effect food AZD4635 . This may perform either dose-escalation cohort ( monotherapy combination ) dose-expansion cohort .</detailed_description>
