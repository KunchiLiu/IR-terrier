	<brief_summary>Aging often associate multiple chronic condition conduct increased consumption drug . Drug therapy necessary treatment many disease . However , misuse drug , particularly link potentially inappropriate prescribing polypharmacy , increase iatrogenic risk lead adverse event fall , cognitive decline , increase use health system : hospital admission , emergency room visit , institutionalization . These problem common since 20 % emergency room use elderly patient due adverse event relate drug . Nearly 28 % adverse event relate drug prescription could avoid . Interventions optimize drug therapy show reduction number potentially inappropriate medication , impact health , rarely evaluate . If association death establish , link loss functional autonomy , lead reduce quality life significant cost care , investigate . The evolution towards functional disability , frequent age many cause , among could prevent . The optimization drug prescription could thereby delay prevent loss functional autonomy reduce risk adverse event , fall cognitive decline improve management chronic disease . Our hypothesis optimization program drug prescribing may slow progression functional dependence . To assess effect optimization program drug prescribe level functional autonomy , multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial conduct geriatric memory consultation . Expected result The implementation `` OPTIM '' program enable optimization drug prescribe elderly patient therefore slow prevent progression addiction . It also help develop strengthen collaboration communication team geriatric consultation , clinician pharmacist refer physician town ( private practice ) . In addition , pharmaceutical notice send refer physician help raise awareness prescription drug patient .</brief_summary>
