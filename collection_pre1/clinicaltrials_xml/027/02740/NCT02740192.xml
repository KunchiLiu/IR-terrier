	<brief_title>Pain Control After Total Knee Arthroplasty : Is There Benefit In Adding Single Shot Adductor Canal Block Existing Multimodal Pain Regimen Periarticular Injection Protocol ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose project compare effectiveness two different well accepted approach nerve blockade order improve pain control total knee arthroplasty . Specifically , study seek identify adductor canal blockade provide additional pain relief decrease morphine consumption use addition local infiltration anesthetic ( periarticular injection ) . Aims : 1. compare pain score post operative period two group . 2. compare morphine equivalent require postoperative period 3. compare patient satisfaction pain control post operative period 4. compare physical exam finding joint range motion post operative period 5. compare ability participate physical therapy post operative period Total knee arthroplasty associate intense pain post operative period . Pain control essential patient population . Beyond ethical humanitarian concern , pain show literature affect outcomes total knee replacement . Patients pain tend bad range motion , decrease participation physical therapy , increase time discharge , downstream medical sequela well . Pain show cause exacerbate delirium postoperative period . Patients pain ambulate less stay bed , therefore increase risk deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism . Patients pain consume opioids , well know side effect , constipation , nausea , vomit , pruritus , addiction , alter mental status . Early joint range motion prevents irreversible joint stiffness pain , affect long term outcome . Pain control patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty improve recent year . The current standard become multimodal approach , consist preoperative , intraoperative post operative intervention . The multimodal approach work prevent address pain multiple location target multiple different pain receptor pain generator . There much attention give injection nerve block addition standard pain medication antiinflammatories , acetaminophen , opioids . There many publish study investigate various medication regimen , periarticular injection cocktail , post operative nerve block . These study show modality work well placebo . Several study show post operative block provide additional benefit use conjunction periarticular injection . These study do femoral nerve catheter adductor canal catheter stay place several day post operative require subsequent bolus . No study literature study additional benefit single shot adductor canal block . The rationale injection give time surgery affect local nerve pain receptor adductor canal block , via different technique . Therefore , investigator believe adductor canal block may prove additional benefit investigator patient . The ultimate goal identify best pain control protocol decrease pain post operative period . Developing protocol may require addition subtraction various treatment modality . This study look adductor canal block , find unnecessary prevent patient receive unnecessary procedure . If find effective reduce pain , study provide direct evidence use single shot adductor canal blockade addition periarticular injection .</detailed_description>
