	<detailed_description>Alive &amp; Thrive ( A &amp; T ) multi-year initiative improve infant young child feeding ( IYCF ) practice . During Phase 1 ( A &amp; T-1 , 2009-2014 ) , fund Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , A &amp; T aim reduce undernutrition death cause suboptimal IYCF practice three country - Bangladesh , Ethiopia , Viet Nam . A &amp; T-1 strategy Bangladesh design support improvement IYCF three key way : 1 ) improving policy regulatory environment ( advocacy ) ; 2 ) shape IYCF demand practice ( community-based intervention ) ; 3 ) increase supply , demand , use high quality complementary food ( private sector engagement ) . In addition , communication component integrated focus area support activity . In 2014 , IFPRI collaboration DATA conduct endline survey . The overall finding evaluation indicate A &amp; T 's work Bangladesh remarkable success story scale challenge date field nutrition : complex , high intensity at-scale behavior change communication intervention . This demonstrated series finding reach interpersonal counseling intervention mass medium , well attributable improvement several critical indicator . During intervention period , A &amp; T facilitate train 75,000 frontline worker health provider across country . The program model reach large scale estimate 1.7 million mother child 2 year 50 sub-districts . The mass medium intervention operate national level national television channel . Compared 2010 baseline survey , improvement see several key IYCF practice attributable A &amp; T intensive package intervention . Specifically , large significant impact see two key breastfeed indicator : EBF ( DID impact estimate : 36.9 percentage point-pp ) early initiation BF ( DID 19.4 pp ) . Similarly , large significant impact see minimum dietary diversity ( DID 16.3 pp ) , minimum meal frequency ( DID 14.7 pp ) , minimum acceptable diet ( DID 22.0 pp ) , consumption iron rich food ( DID 24.6 pp ) . In 2016 , follow study conduct determine sustain impact IYCF practice , expansion operation promote practice new area , diffusion IYCF information , two year termination external project support . Because achievement related service delivery outcomes intend sustain intervention area even expand area BRAC 's Essential Health Care program operates , include comparison area , study aim examine element original intervention comparison area . This study focus follow-up survey BRAC community-based model . The study research question include : Sustained impact 1 . To extent IYCF knowledge practice sustain intervention area ? 2 . To extent exposure IYCF nutrition behavior change communication sustain intervention area ? Expanded operation reach 1 ) To extent exposure IYCF nutrition behavior change communication expand ( i.e . comparison area ) ? Diffusion information 1 ) To extent IYCF information diffuse social network source ( i.e . BRAC frontline worker ) ?</detailed_description>
