	<brief_summary>Depression one common symptom multiple sclerosis ( MS ) life-time prevalence major depressive disorder ( MDD ) 50 % . Depression occur frequently MS chronic disease include neurological inflammatory disorder may contribute low quality life , cognitive problem , difficulty work , poor long term health outcome . Despite clinical relevance , biological mechanism may responsible high risk MS patient develop depression unknown . In observational study , investigator explore molecular mechanism responsible impaired regulation immune cell relapsing-remitting ( RR ) MS patient depression . Investigators compare molecular phenotypical profile immune cell obtain RRMS patient clinical depression ( n=50 ) , match MS patient suffer depression ( n=50 ) well match healthy control ( n=50 ) match patient depression without comorbid neurological disorder ( n=50 ) .</brief_summary>
