	<brief_summary>This study aim test efficacy type non-invasive brain stimulation ( NIBS ) , know repetitive transcranial magnetic ( rTMS ) stimulation , improve mobility , particularly gait stability variability , executive dysfunction old adult . The study conduct forty old adult ( â‰¥60 year ) diagnosis executive dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Mobility Cognition Older Adults Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study use rTMS build upon investigator previous work demonstrate link cognitive impairment , particularly executive dysfunction , mobility/gait abnormality older adult , even label `` cognitively normal '' . Emerging evidence demonstrates executive dysfunction early phenomenon pathway mobility disability subtle change executive function independently associate future fall . The investigator pilot study show pharmacological enhancement executive function , improve gait-motor performance , potentially , reduce mobility decline risk fall . This support rationale promise intervention : enhance cognition prevent mobility decline reduce risk fall . The long-term goal create clinical research program apply rTMS early novel intervention cognitive/motor interaction ultimately delay onset cognitive mobility disability devastate consequence , dementia fall , old adult . However , first necessary study small group senior plan recruitment , study retention compliance , gather preliminary data proof principle proceed large clinical trial .</detailed_description>
