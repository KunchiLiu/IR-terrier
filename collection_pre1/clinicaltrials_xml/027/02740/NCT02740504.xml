	<brief_summary>A trial conduct within company new non-contact respiration rate ( RR ) sensor . The device compare accuracy RR measurement clear device , SOMNOScreen Easy , use chest effort band . The RR measure short duration subject sit upright chair , non-contact sensor various distance subject . A total 20 subject test , gender , select represent wide range age body mass index</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reassure Spot Respiration Rate Accuracy Compared SOMNOScreen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Reassure use Radio Frequency ( RF ) wave detect small movement human body due respiration . The reference device , SOMNOScreen , use chest effort band . The Reassure non-contact comfortable convenient quick RR measurement , similar way Infra-Red thermometer compare traditional under-the-tongue mercury thermometer . The aim explore variation human body could effect radio reflection human torso , thus affect potential detection accuracy breathe rate . Factors could affect non-contact RF performance : - High Body Mass Index ( BMI ) could potentially reduce chest wall movement breathing , alter nature breathing . - Elderly , thin skin ( ie pensioner low BMI ) may less RF reflection . - Female breast tissue may effect detection accuracy . This tested number distance non-contact sensor also subject thick comforter ( duvet ) laid across . This test prove RR measurement Reassure unaffected thickness clothing blanket wear .</detailed_description>
