	<detailed_description>Study design : Double-Blinded Randomised control trial Study aim : This vivo study aim compare salivary fluoride concentration different fluoride formulation form toothpaste without post-brushing water rinse . Study objectives : To compare salivary fluoride concentration different fluoride formulation form toothpaste , without post-brushing water rinse . Toothpaste formulation include : sodium fluoride ( NaF ) , sodium monofluorophosphate ( MFP ) , sodium fluoride plus sodium monofluorophosphate combine ( NaF + MFP ) , Amine fluoride ( AmF ) stannous fluoride sodium fluoride combine ( SnF + NaF ) . Fluoride-free toothpaste serve control study . Concentration standardise formulation . Results study would reflect oral hygiene instruction give patient term tooth brush frequency , fluoride-containing dentifrice different formulation post-brushing rinsing practice . Null hypothesis : The null hypotheses study : All follow toothpaste formulation significant difference term salivary clearance rate : oNon-fluoridated toothpaste oSodium fluoride ( Naf ) toothpaste oSodium fluoride sodium monofluorophosphate combine toothpaste ( NaF+ MFP ) oStannous fluoride sodium fluoride combine ( SnF+NaF ) toothpaste oAmine fluoride toothpaste ( AmF ) oSodium monofluorophosphate toothpaste Materials investigation : The experimental material investigate take list available brand UK publish deliver well oral health : evidence-based toolkit prevention . - Control toothpaste ( 0 ppmF ) - Sodium fluoride toothpaste 1,450 ppm F - Sodium monofluorophosphate toothpaste1,450 ppm F - Sodium monofluorophosphate + sodium fluoride combine toothpaste 1,450 ppm F - Stannous fluoride + sodium fluoride combine toothpaste1,450 ppm F - Amine fluoride toothpaste 1,400 ppm F Sample size power calculation : Statistical advice seek sample size calculation perform use PASS 11.0 software . A sample least 3 participant need group . The study aim test 12 different group , 5 participant group , give total number 60 participant . As recommended Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) committee investigator rerun power calculation , use raw data Issa Toumba , 2004 without data control group , similar result obtain . The Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) approve increase sample size least 120 participant total . Obtaining informed consent Contact detail enclose recruitment email , flyer information sheet . Information sheet copy consent sheet send participant email , post come pick comfort . Participants still opportunity contact lead researcher question query either contact number university email . The information sheet research study use invitation letter well . On research day , consent sheet explain informed consent obtain participant . The original copy consent sheet keep lead researcher participant retain copy sign consent form . Anonymising patient Participants identified numerical number rather names . Blinding toothpaste group A third party put toothpaste small identical container label group number ( G1-12 ) , batch number expiry date . This do randomly use follow website . http : //www.randomlists.com/team-generator A file attach checklist explain randomisation process . Random assignment toothpastes participant With aid follow website ( https : //www.randomlists.com/team-generator ) , reference number ( participant number ) randomly assign one 12 group . Ethical approval : All required information provide Ethical committee ( Leeds Health Authority / United Leeds Teaching Hospitals ) advance ethical approval obtain prior commencement study . Elective assessment participant : When participant contact lead examiner ( respond email poster ) participate research study , volunteer ask several question medical history ( medical questionnaire ) determine whether fall within ASA I ASA II category . Other ASA category ( ASA III high ) exclude study , inform consent obtain information ( i.e . information sheet ) sent . If participant contact lead examiner email , medical history questionnaire ask reply email . If however , participant show interest phone , medical questionnaire obtain phone . For participant show interest phone , give option whether want information sheet mail , email prefer pick convenience . For participant include research gender , age carious status record assessment sheet . This information remain anonymous identify participant since participant identify number . After result analysis , result disseminate participant attach appreciation letter .
