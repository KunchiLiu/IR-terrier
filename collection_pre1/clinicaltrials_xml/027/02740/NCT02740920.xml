	<brief_summary>Studies show study drug , pembrolizumab , work help immune system . In way , pembrolizumab may help slow growth melanoma may cause cancer cell die . Compared standard treatment , pembrolizumab seem lengthen time patient live overall time without cancer get bad .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Response Pembrolizumab Metastatic Melanoma : Computed Tomography ( CT ) Texture Analysis Predictive Biomarker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose study find type CT ( compute topography ) scan help know pembrolizumab work . This CT scan ( call Texture Analysis ) look tumour fine detail . The use type CT scan study patient metastatic melanoma . Investigators want see CT scan show patient treat pembrolizumab respond well others . One purpose compare cost within trial cost standard care .</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior registration determine eligibility . Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimental Committee requirement . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . Patients receive prior systemic treatment metastatic melanoma . Patients known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Patients known history know positive Hepatitis B ( HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Patients unknown history Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) require screen . Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression MRI least four week prior first dose study drug ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis systemic steroid least two week . Patients pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration study , start prescreening screen visit 4 month last dose trial treatment . Patients previously severe hypersensitivity reaction treatment another mAb . Patients active autoimmune disease document history autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . ( Only patient active treatment ineligible ) .
