	<detailed_description>This study multi-centre , randomize , blind , placebo control study . The study vaccine recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent ( type 16 18 ) vaccine ( Yeast ) , placebo aluminium phosphate diluent . After informed receive consent participants/guardians , 1200 healthy female age 9-45 enrolled three age group : 9-17 , 8-26 , 27-45 . With proportion 1:1 , vaccine group placebo group receive injection 0.5ml vaccine placebo diluent . Participants injected vaccine placebo three-dose schedule ( 0 , 2 , 6 month ) . After inoculation , immediate reaction observe 30 minute , local systemic reaction systematically observe 7 day . After first inoculation , adverse event collect one month final inoculation , serious adverse event collect 6 month final inoculation . For every participant , blood sample collect first inoculation ( month 0 ) , one month final inoculation ( month 7 ) , 6 month final inoculation ( month 12 ) detect neutralize antibody HPV type 16 18 , proceed safety immunogenicity analysis . For participant 9-14 age group receive vaccine , neutralize antibody also detect month 24 , 36 48 examine immune persistency . Meanwhile , participant choose study deviation gene expression vaccination association neutralize antibody level .</detailed_description>
