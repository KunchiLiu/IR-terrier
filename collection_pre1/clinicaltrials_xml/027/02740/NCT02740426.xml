	<brief_title>Prophylactic Intravesical Chemotherapy Prevent Bladder Recurrence After Diagnostic Ureteroscopy Primary Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Upper tract urothelial carcinoma ( UTUC ) relatively uncommon compare bladder cancer account 5-10 % urothelial carcinoma [ Munoz et al. , 2000 ; Siegel et al. , 2012 ; Rouprêt et al . 2015 ] , estimate annual incidence Western country ~2 case per 100,000 inhabitant . In 17 % case , concurrent bladder cancer present [ Cosentino et al. , 2013 ] . Urinary cytology , cystoscopy compute tomograpy urography perform standard diagnostic work-up grade A recommendation [ Rouprêt et al. , 2015 ] . Diagnostic ureteroscopy biopsy perform , certainly case additional information impact treatment decision . Such ureteroscopic biopsy determine tumour grade 90 % case low false-negative rate [ Rojas et al. , 2012 ] . Ureteroscopy prove invaluable case suspect UTUC , especially diagnosis equivocal , nephron sparing surgery consider . However , pose potential hindrance , include difficulty obtain adequate tissue , inconsistent pathologic interpretation prediction , high rate upgrade upstaging time nephroureterectomy [ Potretzke et al. , 2015 ] . Recurrence bladder management UTUC occur 22-47 % UTUC patient [ Xylinas et al. , 2012 ; Zigeuner et al. , 2006 ; Novara et al. , 2008 ] , compare 2-6 % contralateral upper tract [ Li et al. , 2010 ; Novara et al. , 2009 ] . At institution , report 30.8 % UTUC patient develop intravesical recurrence , line global trend [ Fang et al. , 2013 ] . Although risk factor development bladder tumor post surgical management UTUC previously study , considerable variation observe literature . In previously publish study , point low tumor grade , tumor multifocality , concomitant carcinoma situ ( CIS ) , tumor locate low ureter , ureteroscopy history unmethylated promoter GDF15 RASSF1A promoter consider predictor develop bladder recurrence surgery univariate multivariate analysis [ Fang et al. , 2013 , Xiong et al. , 2015 ] . As effective tool evaluate UTUCs visually biopsy , ureteroscopy selectively use early UTUC patient without atypical radiography . It hypothesis retrograde flow , increased urine flow rate intraluminal pressure might lead shed tumor cell ( intraluminal tumor seed think contribute intravesical recurrence nephroureterectomy ) , implant bladder develop recurrence [ Xiong et al. , 2015 ] . AIM OF THE WORK This clinical trial design evaluate efficacy single immediate intravesical chemotherapy instillation prevention bladder recurrence diagnostic ureteroscopy UTUCs .</detailed_description>
