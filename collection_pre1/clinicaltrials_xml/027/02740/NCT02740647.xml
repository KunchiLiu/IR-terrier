	<detailed_description>The first Orthographic operation carry 1849 , correction malocclusion , United States America . Back , surgery merely mandibular operation call Hullihen 's procedure do general surgeon . However , first cooperation surgeon orthodontists evolution early orthognathic surgery cradle St. Louis orthodontist Edward Angle ( 1898 ) surgeon Vilray Blair ( 1906 ) . During 19th orthognathic surgery underwent minor improvement , never less , begin 1950s , orthognathic surgery deem true specialty origin , lead tremendous success world . Nowadays , orthognathic surgery perform correct dental skeletal deformity , also conduct treatment various congenital cranio-facial syndrome , Crouzon syndrome , Treacher syndrome Apert 's syndrome . However , orthognathic surgery innocent procedure , since contains several complication . Pain , swell , neurosensory deficit post operative infection common complication . While postoperative infection common one , 2 % 33.4 % percentage occurrence . Postoperative infection increase mortality rate orthognathic procedure may create challenge surgeon medical staff , thus , reduce prevalence critical issue define success unique procedure . Preoperative prophylaxis proven efficient decrease rate postoperative infection orthognathic surgery . While current literature regard efficacy postoperative antibiotic questionable still consensus efficacy . This study prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study investigate efficacy postoperative antibiotic . And try state consensus prescribe postoperative antibiotic . Objectives Goals study : The main goal present study evaluate efficacy post operative antibiotic decrease rate postoperative infection orthognathic surgery . Secondary objective state formulate consensus prescribe postoperative antibiotic . Study Design : The current study prospective , double blind , randomize , placebo control , clinical trial . The impact post-operative antibiotic prevention early surgery related infection investigate . The potential benefit study lie particular reduce various side effect unwise administration antibiotic , along high cost bacterial resistant result antibiotic overuse . The study subject allocate investigator two study group use randomization . The Intervention group get intra-venous1GR Amoxicillin Clavulanate 3 time day 5 day post surgery ; Control group get intra-venous Placebo 5 day . As described , 50 patient participate study , important prerequisite study completely healthy patient . Then patient allocate randomly two subgroup : intervention group control group , mention .</detailed_description>
