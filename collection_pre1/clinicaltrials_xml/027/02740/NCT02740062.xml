	<brief_summary>This trial design preliminary evaluate efficacy safety NIBS system evaluation treatment neuropathic pain . The NIBS system evaluate brain neuronal network activity customize personalize treatment utilize low current non invasive brain stimulation technology neuropathic pain central component . single meeting trial include brain activity evaluation single treatment sham treatment . The goal study evaluate central brain component neuropathic pain subject , effect conventional tDCS treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuropathic pain pain persist nerve injury heal result significant functional structural change nervous system similar memory process . As result , neuropathic pain propose `` persistence memory pain and/or inability extinguish memory pain evoke initial inciting injury '' . A firm conclusion neurobiology learn memory different type memory distinct mechanism ( e.g. , declarative memory vs procedural memory ) . A similar distinction make pain : various chronic pain state distinct central mechanism . Accumulating evidence suggest chronic pain type nociceptive memory mediate structural functional plasticity multiple pathways cortical , subcortical , spinal , peripheral levels.Elucidating basal neuronal signature person suffer chronic pain enables optimize treatment study constant patient regardless basal activity In study participant undergo diagnosis personalize central manifestation characteristic neuropathic pain evaluate efficacy standard , commonly use tDCS treatment , base diagnosis . purpose single meeting take place participant undergo evaluation , sham treatment standard tDCS treatment .</detailed_description>
