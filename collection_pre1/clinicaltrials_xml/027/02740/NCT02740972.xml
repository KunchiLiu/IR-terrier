	<detailed_description>This Phase II , multiple center , 2-period , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose find study NS-065/NCNP-01 administer infusion weekly 24 week ambulant boy age 4- &lt; 10 year DMD . Two dose level cohort enrol . Period 1 study conduct double-blind fashion . Randomized patient receive weekly IV infusion NS-065/NCNP-01 placebo first 4 week participation ( Period 1 ) NS-065/NCNP-01 IV infusion week 5-24 ( 20 week active treatment - Period 2 ) . Analysis safety data Period 1 40mg/kg dose cohort complete prior enrol patient 80mg/kg dose cohort . Patients complete 24-week study eligible open-label extension study . Clinical efficacy assess regularly schedule study visit , include functional test six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , time stand ( TTSTAND ) , time run/walk 10 meter ( TTRW ) , time climb 4 stair ( TTCLIMB ) quantitative muscle test ( QMT ) . All patient undergo muscle biopsy bicep baseline second muscle biopsy Week 24 . Safety assess collection adverse event ( AEs ) , blood urine laboratory test , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign , physical examination throughout study . Serial blood sample take four study visit ass pharmacokinetics study drug .</detailed_description>
