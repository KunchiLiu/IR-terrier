	<detailed_description>Asthma COPD chronic inflammatory diseases airway although precise cell mediator involve distinct . Both disease characterise airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) response exogenous stimulus allergens asthma environmental pollutant . There currently cure asthma new drug combination drug need benefit patient particularly severe disease . Activation JAK/STAT pathway may participate pathogenesis asthma . STAT1 STAT6 expression elevate animal model asthma low airways patient . STAT6 activate key cytokine involve asthma IL-13 primary human bronchial epithelial cell . In addition , baseline phospho-STAT1 phospho-STAT6 level increase systemic T cell steroid naïve asthmatic Th2 cytokine IL-4 , IL-13 TSLP activate STAT1 STAT6 number airway cell . In animal model allergen-induced AHR , airway inflammation include CXCL9 CXCL10 involve STAT1 . In addition , STAT6 knockout mouse response IL-4 , develop Th2 cell response IL-4 , fail produce IgE , bronchial hyperresponsiveness BAL eosinophilia allergen sensitization . The expression CCL11 , CCL17 CCL22 also involve STAT6 model . Importantly , STAT1 critical signalling molecule involve production type I IFNs ( α/β ) , IFN-γ resistance viral respiratory infection . JAK/STATs inhibitor prove effective clinical trial rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease . Therefore , propose use primary airway epithelial cell culture model grown air : liquid interface ( ALI culture ) evaluate efficacy novel JAK/STAT inhibitor , VR588 , CP-690550 fluticasone proprionate ( FP ) suppress inflammatory readout induce IL-13 TNF/IFN .</detailed_description>
