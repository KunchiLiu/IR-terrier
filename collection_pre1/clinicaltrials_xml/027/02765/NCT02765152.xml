	<brief_title>Effects Training Rhythmic Discrete Aiming Movements Arm Control Functionality After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy-five patient randomize three group receive conventional therapy , consist combination mobility exercise joint , muscle stretching , strength training , motor coordination exercise , unilateral bilateral motor task well orient task train upper limb focus functional task . The group receive additional intervention consist aim movement practice accord two different protocol : discrete movement target place different direction distance ; rhythmic movement also target place different direction distance . Both additional interventional intervention conduct 30 minute 5 week-period ( total : 10 session ) . Clinical outcome ( motor control ) , functional kinematic collect baseline five week . Functional result collect begin , 5 week 3 month randomization . Data collect blind assessor patient ' allocation group . All statistical analyzes carry follow principle intention treat analysis difference group perform use linear mixed model .</detailed_description>
