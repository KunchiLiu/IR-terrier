	<detailed_description>The overall goal quality improvement project test two strategy implement share decision making , incorporate Decision Precision lung cancer screen tool . The investigator use multi-site , cluster-based randomization compare standard implementation intensive implementation . Secondly , investigator determine effect tool use allow provider design risk threshold algorithms enrol site step wedge design risk tailor . Thirdly , investigator determine factor important successful implementation share decision make tool . Finally , investigator human subject research component evaluate effect Decision Precision patient 's knowledge risk benefit lung cancer screening , quality decision making , satisfaction care .</detailed_description>
