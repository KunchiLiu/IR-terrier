	<brief_summary>Coronary revascularization improve survival patient coronary artery disease . However , many patient leave poor physical mental health . Traditional cardiac rehabilitation involve moderate intensity continuous exercise ( MICE ) . Alternatives traditional cardiac rehabilitation programming may however provide superior understudied benefit patient poor physical mental health . Nordic walk ( NW ) high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) two example alternative program cardiac rehabilitation , may provide superior physical mental health benefit compare traditional MICE . The main purpose project , therefore , determine short long term physical mental health benefit alternative cardiac rehabilitation modality , include NW HIIT exercise capacity , quality life depression 12-week program .</brief_summary>
