	<brief_summary>When provide amplification post-implantation residual acoustic hearing implanted ear , low frequency boundary modify minimize avoid overlap frequency cod acoustic hearing present electrical stimulation . This boundary term cross-over frequency ( Fc ) effect modify parameter investigate study . To avoid research confound prior bias particular frequency allocation , study conduct newly implant recipient . This study also investigate whether test measure ability use low frequency hear objective measure predict prefer Fc speech performance benefit .</brief_summary>
