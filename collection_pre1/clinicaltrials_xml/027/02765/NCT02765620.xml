	<brief_summary>Chemo-radiotherapy target therapy widely use non-surgical treatment solid tumor . Early assessment treatment response consider efficient helpful clinical management personalize therapy.RECIST 1.1 criterion accept widely . Complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) define RECIST criterion . This type classification divide intrinsically continuous data ( tumor size ) 4 bin , lose statistical power ease nomenclature convenience . The 18F-FDG PET exam base metabolic information consider overcome limitation anatomic image suitable assessment therapeutic response.PERCIST 1.0 proposes series detail unambiguous regulation standardization procedure ensure reproducibility . Complete metabolic response ( CMR ) , partial metabolic response ( PMR ) , stable metabolic disease ( SMD ) , progressive metabolic disease ( PMD ) define PERCIST criterion . So far , several study use metabolic-based PERCIST criterion patient solid tumor , include lung cancer , digestive tumor lymphoma , etc . But study limitation small study sample , thus need investigate . Compared RECIST , advantage PERCIST evaluate chemotherapy , especially targeted therapy , distinguish PMR SMD patient SD group RECIST , good predict response rate . Recently , several study apply PERCIST criterion evaluate neoadjuvant chemotherapy pancreatic cancer rectal cancer , reveal metabolic response result well related pathology . All study conclude PERCIST criterion could help make clinical therapeutic decision . Moreover , several study show PERCIST advantage predict early response several malignant tumor . The aim multicenter study 1 ) evaluate treatment response newly diagnose pre-therapeutic patient solid tumor go receive baseline , early follow-up ( certain period treatment cycle ) final ( treatment ) 18F-FDG PET/CT ; 2 ) compare PERCIST criterion RECIST 1.1 criterion prediction treatment response , especially early stage treatment ; 3 ) reveal value PERCIST criterion clinical therapeutic management tail therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Newly diagnose pre-therapeutic patient solid tumor , include limited : lung cancer , lymphoma , gastric cancer , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , cervical cancer etc . 2 . Study sample : base ongoing retrospective result , optimal study sample expect &gt; 150 case per cancer type . 3 . Treatment regimen : base certain cancer type . 4 . Inclusion criterion : age 30-80 year old ( might differ base certain cancer type ) ; newly diagnosis solid tumor prove imaging ; pathology prove primary solid tumor ; first PET/CT scan perform kind anti-tumor treatment include surgery ; anti-tumor treatment except required trial ; write informed consent signature study ; complete medical history clinical record ( include physical examination , electrocardiogram , hematology , biochemistry , tumor pathology etc ) ; follow-up PSF OS year 5 . Exclusion criterion : pregnancy , lactation , impaired renal liver function ; receive additional anti-tumor treatment ( include surgery ) require trial ; poorly control diabetes ; poor compliance ; fail perform scan ; contrary standard operating procedure ; without definite pathologic diagnosis follow-up result ; suitable clinical trial ( example mental illness ) 6 . Withdrawal criterion : subject demand ; miss follow-up ; severe incident ; reason fail complete trial Prospective Study : 18F-FDG PET/CT scan perform treatment ( baseline ) , certain period treatment cycle ( early follow-up ) whole treatment process ( final ) . Using PERCIST 1.0 criterion PET image RECIST 1.1 criterion CT image monitor assess treatment response prognosis . 1 . Early treatment response assessment : use baseline data early follow-up data Base PERCIST 1.0 criterion , CMR , PMR SMD consider response ; PMD consider non-response ; Base RECIST 1.1 criterion , CR , PR , SD consider response ; PD consider non-response 2 . Evaluate treatment response : use baseline data , early follow-up data final data Base PERCIST 1.0 criterion , CMR , PMR SMD consider response ; PMD consider non-response ; Base RECIST 1.1 criterion , CR , PR , SD consider response ; PD consider non-response 3 . Compare PERCIST RECIST criterion : correlation analysis 4 . Evaluate prognostic value : use baseline data , early follow-up data , final data well follow PFS OS time ( Kaplan-Meier survival plot ) Study protocol 1 ) Clinical data : enroll patient accord inclusion/exclusion criterion , record clinical information image data keep follow-up one year . 2 ) 18F-FDG PET/CT protocol : GE Discovery Elite PET/CT scanner use multicenter trial protocol . Patients instruct fast least 6 hour 18F-FDG PET/CT scan . Blood glucose level measure tracer inject . Whole-body PET/CT image , generally top skull mid-thigh , acquire 50~70 min intravenous injection 18F-FDG dose 0.08~0.10 mCi per kilogram body weight . Patients ask void bladder immediately scan minimize presence tracer urinary tract . PET data acquire reconstruct use SharpIR+ VUE Point HD+TOF , 2min/bed . The PET data attenuation correct ( AC ) integrate CTAC technology . CT data acquire breath-hold 120 kV , 30-210 mA modulate GE SmartmA technique noise index 25 ; slice thickness 3.75 mm , slice interval 3.27 mm , pitch 1.375 , matrix size 512×512 scan FOV 50cm . 3 ) Data archive : All clinical information original DICOM data archive individual institution . Post-processed result use PETVCAR software archive uploaded central server . Institutions without PETVCAR software need upload PET/CT DICOM data central server analysis certain physician . 4 ) Data Analysis : patient image data analysis three professional nuclear medicine physician GE Advantage Workstation ( AW ) use PETVCAR software ( base RECIST 1.1 criterion PERCIST 1.0 criterion ) . Fig 1 . RECIST1.1 PERCIST1.0 criterion PETVCAR software RECIST 1.1 criterion : Measurable , unidimensional ( LD : size conventional techniques≥20 mm , spiral CT≥10 mm ; node : target short axis ±15 mm , nontarget 10- 15-mm node , normal &lt; 10 mm ) Nonmeasurable : lesion , include small lesion ; evaluable recommend Target lesion ( change sum LDs , maximum 2 per organ 5 total [ 1 organ ] ) : CR , disappearance target lesion , confirm ≥4 wk ; PR , ≥30 % decrease baseline , confirm 4 wk ; PD , ≥20 % increase small sum observe overall 5-mm net increase appearance new lesion ; SD , neither PR PD criterion meet Nontarget lesion : CR , disappearance nontarget lesion normalization tumor marker , confirm ≥4 wk ; PD , unequivocal progression nontarget lesion appearance new lesion ; non-PD : persistence one nontarget lesion tumor marker normal limit ; PD must `` unequivocal '' nontarget lesion ( e.g. , 75 % increase volume ) ; PD also new `` positive PET '' scan confirm anatomic progression . Stably positive PET PD correspond anatomic non-PD PERCIST 1.0 criterion : For target lesion : CMR : complete resolution 18F-FDG uptake within measurable target lesion less mean liver activity indistinguishable surround background blood-pool level . Disappearance lesion background bloodpool level . Percentage decline SUL record measurable region , well ( ideally ) time week treatment begin . No new 18F-FDG-avid lesion pattern typical cancer . If progression RECIST , must verify follow-up . PMR : reduction minimum 30 % target measurable tumor 18F-FDG SUL peak . Absolute drop SUL must least 0.8 SUL unit , well . Measurement commonly lesion baseline another lesion lesion previously present active lesion treatment . ROI precisely area baseline scan , though typically . No increase , .30 % SUL size target nontarget lesion ( i.e. , PD RECIST IWC ) ( PD anatomically , must verify follow-up ) . Reduction extent tumor 18F-FDG uptake requirement PMR . Percentage decline SUL record , well ( ideally ) time week treatment begin ( i.e. , PMR 240 , 3 ) . No new lesion . SMD : CMR , PMR , PMD . SUL peak metabolic target lesion record , well ( ideally ) time start recent therapy , week ( i.e. , SMD 215 , 7 ) . PMD : 30 % increase 18F-FDG SUL peak , .0.8 SUL unit increase tumor SUV peak baseline scan pattern typical tumor infection/treatment effect . OR : Visible increase extent 18F-FDG tumor uptake ( 75 % TLG volume decline SUL . OR : New 18F-FDG-avid lesion typical cancer relate treatment effect infection . PMD new visceral lesion confirm follow-up study within 1 mo unless PMD also clearly associate progressive disease RECIST 1.1 . PMD report include percentage change SUV peak , ( ideally , time treatment , week ) whether new lesion present/absent number ( i.e. , PMD , 135 , 4 , new : 5 ) . Because SUL continuous variable , divide response criterion limit number somewhat arbitrary response category lose much data . For reason , PERCIST preserve percentage decline SUV peak report category . Because rapidity scan normalizes important ( fast appear good ) , PERCIST ask time start treatment part reporting . For example , CMR 90 , 1 , probably superior CMR 90 , 10 , especially latter patient SMD 20 , 1 . More one measurement PET response may need differ time , may treatment type-dependent . PERCIST 1.0 evaluate SUL peak hot tumor . This possible limitation approach , lesion response highly correlate general . Additional data require determine many lesion assess 1 . A suggested option include 5 hot lesion , 5 observe RECIST 1.1 measurable . Percentage change SUL report single lesion large increase uptake small decline uptake . Additional study need define many lesion optimal assessment . For nontarget lesion : CMR , disappearance 18F-FDG-avid lesion : PMD , unequivocal progression 18F-FDG-avid nontarget lesion appearance new 18F-FDG-avid lesion typical cancer ; non-PMD : persistence one nontarget lesion tumor marker normal limit . 5 ) Follow-ups : include clinical change ( weight , pain ) treatment , treatment regimen , biochemistry result , pathological result , immunohistochemical result ; PFS OS time Quality control : 1 . All PET/CT scan perform GE Discovery Elite scanner . 2 . Reproducibility accuracy institution analysis third party use PET NEMA phantom . 3 . Multiple PET/CT scan one patient control Q-Check software make sure data quality PETVCAR analysis .</detailed_description>
