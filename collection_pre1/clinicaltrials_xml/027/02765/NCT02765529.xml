	<brief_summary>Nowadays , increase inflammatory chronic disease and/or tumor incidence report part due rise life expectancy . For instance , exposure air pollution , particularly fine particle classify International Agency Research Cancer ( IARC ) risk factor cancer , elderly population particularly sensitive . However , validate biomarkers identify assess exposure fine particle maybe correlate cancerogenesis . AEROTOX-2 prospective pilot study ex vivo effect atmospheric pollution exposure . The study aim identity new biomarkers exposure leukocytes dos fine particle . Secondly , study aim analyze , accord age , leukocytes response urban pollution exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Exposure Air Pollutants ( AEROTOX-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To estimate influence atmospheric pollution whole adult population , subject recruit wide range age ( 20 - 80 year ) . Samples atmospheric particle collect Dunkerque ( North France ) , one important industrial area France . This city influence car traffic , urban industrial activity , wide sea traffic North Sea . Therefore , Dunkerque reference site study atmospheric pollution impact health . These marker search association different mechanism involve toxicity fine particle : inflammatory response , genotoxicity , metabolic activity epigenetic change exposure leukocyte isolate patient dos fine particle . The study correlation biological observation condition exposure air particle bring answer impact environmental pollution health vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
