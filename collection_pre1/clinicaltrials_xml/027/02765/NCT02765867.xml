	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-center , first-in-human study , design evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile single subcutaneous ( SC ) injection RBP-6000 opioid dependent subject . Enrollment begin 6 subject , additional subject enrol safety Day 4 review analyze . Subjects remain residential unit Day 30 post-injection continue visit clinical unit Day 85 plasma buprenorphine level 100 pg/mL , whichever come later . The expected maximum duration participation subject ( include screen ) 120 day . Safety assess adverse event , electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory assessment , local injection site tolerability vital sign . PK assess measure concentration buprenorphine norbuprenorphine plasma . The need rescue medication assess use clinical judgment along information provide COWS score .</detailed_description>
