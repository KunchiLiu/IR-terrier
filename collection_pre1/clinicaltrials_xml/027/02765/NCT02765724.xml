	<brief_title>Determine Pacritinib Pharmacokinetics Impaired Hepatic Patients Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All study participant undergo screen evaluation determine eligibility study . All screening evaluation must perform within 28 day pacritinib dose ( Day 1 ) . Assignment patient hepatic impairment group define Child-Pugh Clinical Assessment Score time Screening . Group 3 patient dose least 2 patient combine Groups 1 2 complete study ( Day 8 ) . Healthy subject enrol hepatic impairment accrual complete allow age- , gender- body mass index- ( BMI ) match hepatic impairment population . Participants admit study site Day -1 ( i.e. , Check-in ) . On Day 1 , upon receipt baseline safety evaluation result confirmation eligibility , study participant administer single dose 400 mg pacritinib orally fasting condition . Fasting start 10 hour prior pacritinib administration continue additional 4 hour administration . Following administration pacritinib , participant remain confined study site 168 hour ( 8 day ) pacritinib dose collection blood PK safety assessment .</detailed_description>
