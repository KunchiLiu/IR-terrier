	<brief_summary>The research objective study determine whether intervention associate robotic device call `` Assisted Movement Enhanced Sensation ( AMES ) use enhance balance recovery follow unexpected loss balance condition area brain involve lower-limb ( LL ) motor control . It hypothesize AMES improve balance recovery , gait , reduce fall near-frail elderly people improve LL strength , speed , coordination . AMES , medical intervention robotic device originally develop aid patient ' recovery injury central nervous system limit movement . Earlier publish study demonstrate unique property AMES , namely capable reduce sensorimotor impairment severely impaired , underserved population patient brain spinal cord injury . AMES applies assist movement , biofeedback , sensory stimulation simultaneously non-invasively upper low limb , initial intent address impairment weakness , spasticity , sensory loss , dyssynergia ( i.e. , co-contraction ) . These reduction impairment achieve cortical plasticity . In present study , methodology apply low limbs near-frail elderly reduce fall train fast reaction time , strong reaction , coordinate recovery slip trip</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim study determine preliminarily efficacy AMES intervention help old adult quickly readjust posture order recover unexpected loss equilibrium . An AMES device place operation University Arkansas Medical Sciences ( UAMS ) Out-patient Rehabilitation Therapy Clinic Fayetteville , Arkansas ( AR ) , recruit 20 healthy , near-frail subject . Ten participant randomly assign treatment group , 10 assign control group receive AMES intervention . Before 12 week train bipedal AMES device , ankle strength , range motion , proprioception , reaction time , well gait whole-body stability follow unexpected balance perturbation assess . In addition measure sensorimotor impairment static balance equilibrium , incidence fall 20 participant begin enrollment study total 6 month track . A reduction sensorimotor impairment , improvement dynamic balance , reduction fall incidence treatment group , control group expect .</detailed_description>
