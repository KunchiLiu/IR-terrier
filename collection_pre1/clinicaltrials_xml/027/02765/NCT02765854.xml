	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well ixazomib dexamethasone ixazomib , dexamethasone , lenalidomide work base presence rearrangement gene call nuclear factor kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer B-cells 2 ( NFKB2 ) treat patient multiple myeloma return period improvement respond treatment . Ixazomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes call proteasomes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system cancer cell may also prevent growth new blood vessel tumor need grow . It yet know whether ixazomib dexamethasone , ixazomib , dexamethasone , lenalidomide effective treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixazomib Dexamethasone Versus Ixazomib , Dexamethasone Lenalidomide , Randomized With NFKB2 Rearrangement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : To test whether NFKB2 rearrangement guide selection treatment ( ixazomib [ ixazomib citrate ] plus dexamethasone [ Id ] ixazomib plus lenalidomide dexamethasone [ IRd ] ) conduct follow comparison : I . To compare response rate 4 cycle patient treat Id patient treat IRd confirm lack significant difference overall response . II . To compare response rate 4 cycle non-rearranged rearrange NFKB2 treat Id confirm NFKB2 rearrangement associate reduce response rate . III . To compare response rate 4 cycle patient rearrange NFKB2 treat Id IRd confirm add lenalidomide increase response rate population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time treatment failure ( TTF ) . II . To determine frequency severity adverse event ( AE ) IRd treat cohort . III . To identify novel transcribed mutation associate Id IRd resistance patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) . IV . To determine prevalence NFKB2 rearrangement relapsed/refractory MM patient screen study . V. To determine prevalence NFKB2 rearrangement accord type previous therapy receive patient screen study . VI . To determine toxicity profile study drug accord presence NFKB2 rearrangement . VII . Delineate transcribe mutation associate relapse refractoriness Id IRd treatment ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) -sequencing . OUTLINE : ARM A ( UNMUTATED NFKB2 REARRANGEMENT ) : Patients receive ixazomib orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients mutate NFKB2 rearrangement randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM B ( MUTATED NFKB2 REARRANGEMENT ) : Patients receive ixazomib dexamethasone arm A . ARM C ( MUTATED NFKB2 REARRANGEMENT ) : Patients receive ixazomib dexamethasone arm A lenalidomide PO daily day 1-21 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may proceed autologous stem cell transplant 4 course treatment . After completion study , patient follow monthly .</detailed_description>
