	<brief_summary>Patients severe respiratory disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) obesity-hypoventilation syndrome ( OHS ) benefit non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) . NIV consist machine ( ventilator ) blow air inside patient 's airway mask . NIV provide patient big breath . Bigger breaths help patient oxygen less waste gas ( carbon dioxide ) body . These change improve outcome quality life . In order provide appropriate ventilation patient , ventilator generate different type blowing : - Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) deliver constant flow air mask - Pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) deliver constant flow air mask , top , delivers flow patient begin inhale - Volume target ventilation delivers flow air mask adjust breath breath order achieve preset volume . These different type blowing consequence patient comfort well improvement ventilation . To assess improvement ventilation , currently blood test use , however , reflect overall output may miss subtle change breathe could affect patient feel . Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) new technology involve wear belt sensor around chest provide information well lungs fill air ventilator . It allow non-invasive assessment effect NIV lung ventilation real-time . The investigator hope use EIT technology assess real-time patient lung ventilation use NIV . The investigator hope EIT provide information type blow effective comfortable others .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic lung disease sometimes progress extent patient longer clear waste gas blood . Treatment offer mask machine ( ventilator ) help people breathe aim improve lung condition . It common people 's lung affect variably , i.e . leave right top lung base lung . The way ventilator set may affect well machine deal difference . If lung well ventilator patient may find machine comfortable may effective . Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) new technology involve wear belt sensor around chest provide information well lungs fill air ventilator . It allow assessment difference , previously require use invasive equipment obtain . Optimising ventilator setting administration non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) improve addition individual physiological data . This approach limit due invasive technique require obtain information , often lead less ideal NIV setting promote patient-ventilator asynchrony . It recently demonstrate group patient establish domiciliary NIV degree patient-ventilator asynchrony commonest type asynchrony trigger issue . Triggering asynchrony promote mismatch patient 's intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure ( iPEEP ) apply expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) ineffective effort contribute increased work breathe patient discomfort . Previous strategy use optimise patient trigger involved placement oesophageal catheter order measure neural respiratory drive ( NRD ) diaphragm electromyography ( EMG ) process invasive often poorly tolerate . Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) non-invasive , bedside monitoring technique provide semi-continuous , real-time information regional distribution change electrical resistivity lung tissue due variation ventilation relation reference state . Information gain repeatedly inject small alternate electric current ( usually 5 mA ) high frequency 50 - 80 kHz system skin electrode ( usually 16 ) apply circumferentially around thorax single plane 4th 6th intercostal space . While adjacent pair electrode 'injects ' current ( 'adjacent drive configuration ' ) , remain adjacent passive electrode pair measure difference electric potential . A resistivity ( impedance ) image reconstruct data mathematical algorithm use two dimensional model simplify shape represent thoracic cross-section . The resulting image posse high temporal functional resolution make possible monitor dynamic physiological phenomenon ( e.g . delay regional inflation recruitment ) breath breath basis . It important realize EIT image base image reconstruction technique require least one measurement well-defined reference state . All quantitative data relate reference indirectly quantify ( relative ) change local lung impedance ( absolute ) . EIT use mechanically ventilated patient assess recruitment optimise ventilator setting reduce risk iatrogenic ventilator associate lung injury . In supine posture obese patient generate significant level iPEEP contribute increase level neural respiratory drive compare upright posture . There much debate regard optimal ventilator strategy patient obesity relate respiratory failure , uncontrolled trial data support simple continuous positive airway pressure , pressure support ( PSV ) NIV volume target ( VT ) NIV . There robust evidence suggest superiority single mode post hoc data suggest superior control sleep disorder breathe patient pressure control mode . It unclear whether extended inspiratory time pressure control mode allow superior gas exchange maintain airway distension prevent regional collapse . In COPD , patient ' response treatment influence disease heterogeneity patient show even distribution lung damage others mark difference throughout lung . This variation lead significant difference lung mechanic different region optimal NIV setting region potentially deleterious effect neighbour zone . It show control hypoventilation improve blood gas exchange essential order improve outcome NIV COPD less clear pressure control ventilation advocate Windisch colleague require order achieve effect . Inappropriate setting NIV also lead dynamic distension result decrease tidal volume increase patient discomfort .</detailed_description>
