	<brief_summary>Lambda pegylated form interferon lambda-1a ( IFN-λ ) , conjugate recombinant human interleukin 29 ( rIL-29 ) linear polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) chain . IFN-λ interferon alpha ( IFN-α ) share common interferon ( IFN ) -stimulated gene induction pathway lead broad-spectrum antiviral activity . Since IFN-α demonstrate anti-hepatitis delta virus ( HDV ) activity patient chronic hepatitis delta ( CHD ) , postulate pegylated IFN-λ could also induce HDV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) decline patient CHD . Based IFN-λ 's limited receptor distribution previous data study involve treatment IFN-λ patient hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , postulate Lambda treatment could associate few adverse effect IFN-α treatment . This Phase II study design randomize , open-label study Lambda 120 180 μg subcutaneous ( SC ) injection weekly 48 week patient chronic HDV infection , primary objective study follow : - To evaluate safety tolerability treatment 2 dose level Lambda 48-week treatment period . - To evaluate effect treatment 2 different dos Lambda HDV RNA level .</brief_summary>
