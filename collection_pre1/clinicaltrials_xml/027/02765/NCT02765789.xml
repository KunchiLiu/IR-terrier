	<detailed_description>Rationale : Anti-glomerular basement membrane ( anti-GBM ) glomerulonephritis rare organ-specific autoimmune disease mediate anti-GBM antibody . It characterize acute renal failure due diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis , often accompany pulmonary hemorrhage . Established treatment cyclophosphamide corticosteroid suppress anti-GBM production daily plasma exchange remove circulate anti-GBM antibody . The vast majority patient anti-GBM glomerulonephritis develop irreversible end-stage renal failure despite treatment . The treatment goal anti-GBM glomerulonephritis achieve undetectable anti-GBM titre rapid possible . Immunoadsorption extracorporeal technique selectively remove antibody may lower anti-GBM titre effectively plasma exchange . With technique patient 's plasma pass immunoadsorption column contain protein A binds antibody IgG class like anti-GBM antibody . However , data efficacy anti-GBM removal immunoadsorption compare plasma exchange scarce . In literature , case description clinical effect immunoadsorption patient anti-GBM disease case show recovery renal function despite unfavourable prognosis ( serum creatinine &gt; 500 Âµmol/l and/or high percentage crescent renal biopsy ) . Immunoadsorption presently use Netherlands anti-GBM disease . Objective : To study efficacy , adverse event , logistic feasibility cost immuno-adsorption removal anti-GBM antibody patient acute renal failure due anti-GBM glomerulonephritis . Study design : Interventional , open , non-randomized , pilot study . After informed consent , patient treat accord current treatment protocol exception daily immunoadsorption instead daily plasma exchange . Study population : 8 patient acute renal failure due anti-GBM glomerulonephritis without accompany pulmonary involvement . Intervention : Participating patient treat daily immunoadsorption ( 2.5 time plasma volume ) , instead plasma exchange , anti-GBM titre undetectable . All aspect treatment ( e.g . immunosuppressive treatment , renal replacement therapy ) standard . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary study parameter number day anti-GBM antibody titre toxic level , define &gt; 30 ELISA unit . Plasma level anti-GBM measure immunoadsorption treatment . Courses anti-GBM titre compare historical cohort patient anti-GBM disease treat plasma exchange . Secondary study parameter : 1 . Tolerability adverse event immunoadsorption . 2 . Logistic feasibility define time interval diagnosis start first immunoadsorption treatment ; 3 . Costs immunoadsorption ( personnel material ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : From patient 's perspective , burden daily immunoadsorption comparable daily plasma exchange regard vascular access ( central venous catheter ) blood sample monitor treatment response . The treatment time approximately one hour long plasma exchange ( 4 hour instead 3 hour ) . Possible adverse effect immunoadsorption part current study proposal previous study patient group suggest frequency severity adverse effect immunoadsorption comparable plasma exchange .</detailed_description>
