	<brief_summary>1 . Background : Blepharospasm refers orbital periorbital orbicularis muscle spontaneous spasmodic contraction . Continuous spasm long short , performance non spasm strongly close repeatedly . At present , pathogenesis blepharospasm clear , addition , particularly effective treatment . 2 . Purpose：compare two different surgical method , observe improvement symptom prognosis patient blepharospasm . 3 . Scientific hypothesis : At present , pathogenesis blepharospasm clear , clinical patient blepharospasm showed bilateral eyelid twitching , eye open difficulty symptoms bad tension , anxiety , insomnia , light stimulation wind outside stimulation . At time , clinic，the investigator find facial nerve trigeminal nerve comb improve clinical symptom patient . Therefore , investigator speculate activity related clinical symptom corneal reflex pathway blepharospasm patient . 4 . Research content : blepharospasm patient randomly divide two group , prospective comparative analysis two different surgical method treatment blepharospasm . One group patient perform facial nerve comb microvascular decompression , group patient perform facial nerve , trigeminal nerve comb microvascular decompression , observation postoperative clinical improvement two group patient . 5 . Expected result : To define surgical method treatment blepharospasm , promote use academic clinical practice .</brief_summary>
