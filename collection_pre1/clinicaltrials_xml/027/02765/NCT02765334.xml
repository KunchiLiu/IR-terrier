	<brief_title>A Study Neurostyle Brain Exercise Therapy Towards Enhanced Recovery ( nBETTER ) Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke remain 4th cause death Singapore despite advance neuro-medical care rehabilitation , 40-50 % stroke survivor leave permanent neuro-disability reduce quality life . The previous 2 decade see exponential leap development rehabilitation technology enhance neuroplasticity rehabilitation outcome . One potentially useful technology nBETTER System , develop Institute Infocomm Research , Agency Science , Technology Research ( A*STAR ) . nBETTER portable , internet-connected device detects imagination movement stroke-affected limb use Electroencephalography ( EEG ) -based Brain-Computer Interface ( BCI ) thus deliver visually engage feedback direct neurofeedback aim improve upper limb recovery subacute chronic stroke patient . The pilot study aim recruit 13 patient use multi centre trial design investigate nBETTER system feasibility safety rehabilitation subacute chronic stroke patient upper limb motor impairment determine clinical efficacy , safety feasibility system deliver standard occupational therapy . The investigator primary hypothesis nBETTER feasible safe prototype stroke survivor ( &gt; 3 month ) moderate severe arm impairment ( FMMA 10-50 ) . The primary outcome gain 15 % Fugl-Meyer motor score 6 week 18 session ( total 27 hour ) supervise train occupational therapist bioengineers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Aged 2180 year firstever clinical stroke diagnose CT MRI brain imaging . 2 . Stroke duration 324 month . 3 . Stroke type : ischemic haemorrhagic 4 . FuglMeyer motor score upper limb range 1050 5 . Ability pay attention maintain support sit 1.5 hour continuously 6 . Able give consent understand simple instruction 7 . Fulfils BCI rest brain state initial screen . 1 . Recurrent clinical stroke 2 . Functional status : severe aphasia inattention , unstable medical condition may affect participation ( e.g . unresolved sepsis , postural hypotension , end stage renal failure ) anticipate life expectancy &lt; 1 year due malignancy neurodegenerative disorder ) 3 . Hemispatial neglect ( visual sensory ) severe visual impairment despite visual aid 4 . History epilepsy , severe depression active psychiatric disorder 5 . Skull defect previous cranial surgery would affect physical fit EEG cap interface 6 . Local arm factor : severe spasticity Modified Ashworth scale &gt; 2 region , visual analogue scale ( VAS score ) &gt; 4/10 , fix joint contracture joint replacement , patient poor skin condition would contraindicate repetitive arm training . 7 . TMS contraindication : female reproductive potential reliable contraception ; pregnancy ; cardiac pacemaker ; orthodontics ( brace ) ; metal implant .</criteria>
