	<detailed_description>Objectives The primary endpoint description proportion participant HIV-1 viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL . The secondary endpoint : - Change Baseline CD4+ T-cell count , CD8 cell count , CD4/ CD8 ratio - Proportion subject laboratory alteration - Proportion patient adverse event ( AE ) , serious adverse event ( SAE ) , also accord severity Hypotheses Being retrospective study , formal hypothesis formulate . Background Rationale Antiretroviral therapy change natural history HIV infection . However , antiretroviral therapy must maintain life . Its potential long-term adverse effect may interact synergistically age process , result high incidence comorbidities . The increase number non-antiretroviral drug use treat comorbidities may also place patient high risk clinically meaningful interaction . Nowadays , efficacy well demonstrated antiretroviral drug compare previous time . In fact substantial number HIV-infected patient area antiretroviral therapy widely available achieve sustained suppression plasma HIV replication . In contrast , contribution antiretroviral therapy development progression comorbidities risk potentially severe interaction gain increase importance HIV-infected patient get old . More half HIV-infected patient age ≥ 50 year report suffer two concomitant comorbidities . In patient , maintenance antiretroviral therapy combination include NRTIs PIs may challenge . Data age HIV patient antiretroviral therapy lacking . RAL consider one better-tolerated antiretroviral medication , due limited side effect long-term safety concern . Five-year clinical trial outcome clinical experience demonstrate durable virologic suppression treatment-naïve treatment-experienced patient , include patient extensive antiretroviral history document antiretroviral resistance . Studies also exhibit low adverse effect rate reliable long-term safety lending improve tolerance . Several trial evaluate reduction adverse effect patient switch various antiretroviral agent RAL . Treatment-naïve study demonstrate lipid-neutral effect patient RAL-containing regimen . When transition patient ritonavir-boosted PI regimen , statistically significant decrease total plasma cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein , triglyceride demonstrate . Given negligible interaction cytochrome P450 system , RAL display minimal drug-drug interaction , make good option age patient multiple medication . Study Design This observational retrospective cohort real world describe RAL data , include NUC-sparing regimen , age HIV patient . It phase IV study . 90 patient enrolled Department Public Health Infectious Diseases `` Sapienza '' University Rome . More 4000 HIV patient follow Department Public Health Infectious Diseases `` Sapienza '' University Rome . More 50 % patient ≥ 50 year . From 10 12 % treated raltegravir based- regimen . In retrospective analysis naïve patient raltegravir-based regimen patient switch raltegravir-based regimen consider . For raltegravir-based regimen investigator mean raltegravir third agent triple regimen NRTIs also raltegravir-based regimen NUC-sparing therapy . Raltegravir initiation equivalent baseline . All consecutive patient fulfil follow inclusion criterion consider eligible : - HIV-1 infected patient , - age ≥ 60 year old - naive patient receive raltegravir based-regimen , include Nuc-sparing regimen , - experience patient virological suppression ( HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copy ) switch antiretroviral drug raltegravir-based regimen ( include Nuc-sparing regimen ) toxicity , convenience reason . Data collect medical record . The Time horizon patient follow-up outcome least 12 month . The following information extract database Department : - demographic ( age , sex , race ) - smoke - risk factor HIV infection - time HIV-1 diagnosis ( year ) - history AIDS diagnosis - hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) co-infection - hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) co-infection - presence co-morbidities ( include diabetes , hypertension , CVD , CKD , cancer , etc ) - reason switch raltegravir - time HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL switch - BMI - Hematology ( Hb , PLT ) - Creatinine - eGFR ( CKD-EPI formula ) - Phosphorus - Calcium - AST - ALT - alkaline phosphatase - total , direct , indirect bilirubin - proteinuria - total , HDL- , LDL-cholesterol - triglyceride - glycemia - HIV-RNA - CD4+ , CD8 , CD4/CD8 ratio since start raltegravir - previous ART regimen number previous antiretroviral agent . Follow-up count date start raltegravir VF/TF last available visit , whichever first occur AEs classify mild/moderate , severe life threatening , accord DAIDS Classification . AEs consider unrelated RAL , possibly relate relate , accord physician criterion . Safety data descriptive ; comparison data analyze . Study Procedures At study visit , clinical data collect laboratory analysis comprise CD4+ T cell count , plasma HIV-1 RNA , blood cell , plasma chemistry profile , include fast lipid ( total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [ HDL ] , low- density lipoprotein [ LDL ] cholesterol , triglyceride ) record . Plasma HIV-1 RNA laboratory determination perform locally site throughout follow-up period . Study Duration The Time horizon patient follow-up outcome least 12 month . Statistical Analysis Sample Size Justification Descriptive analyse Baseline characteristic enrol patient present mean value ± standard deviation ( SD ) median value interquartile range , absolute frequency ( relative frequency ) accord variable type distribution . Primary analysis The proportion patient HIV-1 viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL express frequency percentage . The 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) proportion correspond incidence rate calculate . Secondary analyse The change baseline continuous variable assess Student 's t-test pair data normally distribute variable ( base Shapiro-Wilk statistic ) Wilcoxon signed-rank test non normally distribute one . All test two-sided p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Safety data analysis descriptive . Safety data ( AEs , SAEs ) laboratory alteration tabulate , accord severity , descriptive purpose . Power/Sample Size : A sample size 90 subject produce two-sided 95 % CI follow width : sample proportion patient HIV-1 viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL 40 % 60 % , 95 % CI width 0.2 , correspond possible maximum width study . Corresponding widths 0.17 sample proportion 0.30 ( 0.70 ) , 0.15 sample proportion 0.20 ( 0.80 ) 0.13 sample proportion 0.10 ( 0.90 ) ( PASS 11 . NCSS , LLC . Kaysville , Utah , USA ) . Specific Drug Supply Requirements No drug supply required Adverse Experience Reporting Safety data descriptive ; comparison data analyze . If adverse event identify report Italian agency Drugs ( AIFA ) accord law . Safety Assessments For International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) , AE define untoward medical occurrence patient clinical investigation subject administer pharmaceutical product necessarily causal relationship treatment . An AE therefore unfavorable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory finding , example ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal product , whether consider related medicinal product . SAE untoward medical occurrence effect dose : 1 . Results death ; 2 . Is life-threatening ; 3 . Requires hospitalization prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalization ; 4 . Results persistent significant disability incapacity ; and/or 5 . Is congenital anomaly birth defect ; 6 . Is cancer ; 7 . Is associate overdose ; 8 . Is Other Important Medical Event . Life-threatening definition serious adverse event refers event subject risk death time event ; refer event hypothetically might cause death severe . Medical judgment exercise decide whether adverse event/reaction serious situation . Important adverse events/ reaction immediately life-threatening result death hospitalization , may jeopardize subject may require intervention prevent one outcomes listed definition , also consider serious . The severity AEs grade accord follow definition : Mild : awareness sign , symptom , event , easily tolerate ; Moderate : discomfort enough cause interference usual activity may warrant intervention ; Severe : incapacitating inability normal daily living activity significantly affect clinical status , warrant intervention Further detail include study agreement .
