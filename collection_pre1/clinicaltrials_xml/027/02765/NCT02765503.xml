	<brief_title>Resource Sparing Curative Radiotherapy Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck : The HYPNO Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide , head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) constitute approximately 7 % incident cancer , 75 % see low- middle-income country . Life-style factor , particular tobacco alcohol consumption , major etiological factor although increase number HNSCC case associate viral infection ( Epstein Barr Virus Human Papilloma Virus ) . Radiation therapy ( RT ) alone combine cytotoxic molecular target agent mainstay definitive treatment previously untreated locally advanced disease . This therapy offer organ functional preservation many case approximate 30 50 % case obtain longterm loco-regional tumor control . Accelerated RT , increase weekly deliver radiation dose conventional 10 Gy per week , show large number randomize controlled trial associate improved efficacy toxicity ratio relative standard fractionation provide careful balance total dose , dose per fraction overall treatment time choose . The Danish Head Neck Cancer Group trial DAHANCA 6/7 test schedule accelerate normofractionated radiation therapy HNSCC deliver 6 fraction 2.0 Gy per week total dose 66-68 Gy . This schedule give 10 % improvement loco-regional tumor control compare dose deliver 5 fraction per week . The DAHANCA 6/7 schedule test IAEA ACC trial , compare 6 vs. 5 fraction per week allow total dose range 66 Gy 70 Gy . The outcome IAEA ACC trial also show significant 13 % improvement loco-regional control accelerate arm . Thus , accelerate RT deliver 6 fraction per week may reasonably consider standard care definitive RT alone . Clinical evidence point direction 4 week accelerate , hypofractionated schedule radiobiologically interesting alternative accelerate schedule use fraction treatment HNSCC . A series exploratory calculation suggest attractive schedule could 55 Gy 20 fraction ( 2.75 Gy per fraction ) deliver 4 week schedule choose test arm HYPNO . There historical experience schedule North UK many country British Commonwealth . The aim study test whether resource-sparing 4-week course accelerate hypofractionated radiotherapy non-inferior radiotherapy deliver 33 fraction 5.5 week . The study design stratify , balance , randomize study ( phase III ) recruit patient Stage I IV squamous cell carcinoma pharynx , larynx oral cavity exception paranasal sinus , nasopharyngeal stage I II glottic carcinoma . Patients assigned test arm control arm central , randomization , stratify accord follow characteristic : - Institution - Performance status , WHO 0-1 vs. 2 - Tumor sub-site within head neck : pharynx , larynx , oral cavity - Chemotherapy ( yes/no ) Other important prognostic parameter : 2D vs. 3DCRT vs. IMRT ; Tumor stage : T1-2 vs. T3-4 ; Nodal stage : N0-1 vs. N2-3 . These randomly distribute among treatment arm result randomization . Patients review least week treatment . Time severity early radiation reaction mucosa skin note . These data register Treatment Response Form . Patients see 2 month end treatment record persistent early toxicity early tumor response , primary nodal site . Afterwards , patient see every 3 month 2 year 6 monthly 3 year bring total trial follow-up 5 year . CRFs design record information individual study subject require study protocol . The purpose CRF threefold : ) ensure data collection accordance study protocol ; ii ) fulfill regulatory requirement data collection ; iii ) facilitate effective , comprehensive data processing analysis , result reporting , promote structure collection safety efficacy data . The complete CRF 's submit email Data Center : hypno @ humonc.wisc.edu data electronically transfer central trial database . HYPNO use rather novel design non-inferiority trial dual primary endpoint . The primary efficacy endpoint 3 year loco-regional control ( LRC ) - even though 5 year disease status also collect - primary toxicity endpoint 3 year grade 2 high ( moderate severe ) side effect ( TOX ) . All time event measure date randomization . The test arm ( HYPNO -T ) declare non-inferior control arm ) LRC test arm non-inferior control arm AND ii ) Late toxicity test arm non-inferior ( i.e . bad ) control arm . This design develop collaboration HYPNO trial statistician , Prof. Richard Chappell , Department Biostatistics Medical Informatics , University Wisconsin - Madison . Statistical formulation non-inferiority hypothesis dual primary endpoint : HYPOTHESIS I : H0 : LRC TEST arm less LRC CONTROL arm ( Test arm inferior control arm respect LRC ) . HA : LRC TEST arm great equal LRC CONTROL arm ( Test arm non-inferior control arm respect LRC ) . HYPOTHESIS II : H0 : TOX TEST arm great TOX CONTROL arm ( Experimental treatment inferior control treatment respect late toxicity ) . HA : TOX TEST arm less equal TOX CONTROL arm ( Experimental treatment non-inferior control treatment respect late toxicity ) . The required sample size kind design depend heavily choice inferiority margin , decrease value lead steep increase sample size . It also depend extend baseline 3 year LRC TOX rate . These select base publish result IAEA-ACC trial . Thus , target sample size 836 patient . The primary analysis perform randomized patient use intention-to-treat principle . A QA committee form charge aspect quality assurance credentialing center participation HYPNO . Each participate center appoint contact person QA issue ( physician physicist ) . Data exchange dummy run Before first patient randomize center , 'dry run ' data exchange conduct . To end , HNSCC patient center arbitrarily choose local investigator set CRFs fill case submit electronically Data Center . Machine level QA An associated GCP QA program securing compliance protocol establish IAEA , Data Center involve department . Participation IAEA TLD audit mandatory center participate HYPNO trial . A credentialing QA program develop department use IMRT . Patient level QA Radiotherapy plan dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) data first two patient trial center submit central review , possible electronic form . During period center accrue patient trial , Data Center randomly select subset patient ( 5-10 % , small proportion review highly accrue center ) 'crossed ' review 3-4 center review case . It expect total number case review HYPNO exceed 50 . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) appoint . Recommendations stop patient accrual early safety efficacy reason make IDMC . Participating center inform comparative effectiveness toxicity trial arm long trial open accrual . An associated translational research program plan . Formally study run separate research protocol separate inform consent patient obtain accord relevant national regulation .</detailed_description>
