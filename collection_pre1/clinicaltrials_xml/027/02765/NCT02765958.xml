	<brief_summary>Sleep fundamental need human associate work performance disease occurrence . Furthermore , amount people sleep disorder apnea increase largely . Thus , analysis sleep stage measurement sleep quality become important recently . In clinical setting , analysis daily sleep quality depend actigraphy sleep log . However , use actigraphy sleep log really convenient patient . In trial , investigator measure subject ' ECG signal movement use portable ECG device motion sensor . On hand , sleep stage also obtain current wide-established measurement- polysomnography . The ECG signal , movement , sleep stage analyze algorithm artificial neural network . Then , investigator obtain preliminary analysis sleep quality obtain use ECG device algorithm . It helpful doctor realize patent 's sleep quality quickly</brief_summary>
