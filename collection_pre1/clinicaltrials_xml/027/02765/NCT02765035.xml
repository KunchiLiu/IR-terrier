	<brief_title>C-Leg 3 C-Leg 4 Study Transfemoral Amputees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During last two decade many microprocessor control knee joint ( MPK ) appear market.The newly develop C-Leg 4 aim provide improve stand function time offer technology knee´s previous version ( C-Leg 3 ) . Since add functional benefit knee joint anticipate due fact knee control microprocessor , aim post-market study evaluate safety , functional mobility satisfaction microprocessor control prosthetic knee component C-Leg 3 C-Leg 4 comparison mechanical knee joint . Additional goal improve methodological quality research conduct field .</detailed_description>
