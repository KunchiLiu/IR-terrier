	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) critically ill trauma patient show significantly increase mortality , length stay , cost , however detection proven difficult marker like elevated creatinine decrease urine output may take day manifest late indicator AKI . The combination two urinary biomarkers , Tissue Inhibitor Metalloproteinase 2 ( TIMP-2 ) Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 ( IGFBP-7 ) , show increase within 12 hour follow renal insult , allow assessment risk develop acute kidney injury . Therefore , investigator plan assess acute kidney injury critically ill trauma patient determine earlier use urinary TIMP-2 IGFBP-7 via NephroCheck test system . These marker specifically evaluate trauma patient risk AKI .</brief_summary>
