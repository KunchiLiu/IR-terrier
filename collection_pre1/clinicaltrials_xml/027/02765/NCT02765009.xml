	<brief_summary>Most ICU patient develop positive fluid balance , mainly two first week stay . The cause multifactorial : reduce urine output subsequent shock state , positive pressure mechanical ventilation , acute renal failure , post-operative period major surgical procedure , simultaneous fluid load maintain volemia acceptable arterial pressure . Additionally , efficacy fluid load frequently suboptimal , relation severe hypoalbuminemia inflammatory capillary leakage . This result usually cumulate positive fluid balance 10 litre end first week stay . A high number study show positive fluid balance independent factor bad prognosis select population ICU patient : acute renal failure , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , sepsis , post-operative high risk surgery . However , little known putative causal role positive fluid balance outcome . However , two randomize controlled study patient ARDS , strategy fluid balance control demonstrate reduce time mechanical ventilation ICU length stay noticeable adverse effect . Although avoid fluid overload recommend ARDS management , evidence approach would beneficial general population ICU patient ( i.e . sepsis , acute renal failure , mechanical ventilation ) . In addition , fluid restriction -mainly apply early could deleterious reduce tissue oxygen delivery perfusion pressure . There place prospective study compare `` conventional '' attitude base liberal fluid management throughout ICU stay restrictive approach aim control fluid balance , least soon patient circulatory status stabilize . The latter approach would use simple algorithm use fluid restriction diuretic base daily weigh , common procedure ICU , probably reliable cumulative measurement fluid movement patient whose limit underline .</brief_summary>
