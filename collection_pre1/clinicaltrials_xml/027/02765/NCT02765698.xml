	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate ability PET/MRI ( Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) give physician preoperative information specific sit body endometrial cancer may present . If PET/MRI accurate successful provide information , woman future may able less extensive surgery endometrial cancer evaluation PET/MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy PET/MRI Detecting Metastatic Disease Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PET/MRI recently become available institution report sensitivity , specificity , NPV ( Negative predictive value ) , PPV ( Positive predictive value ) , accuracy endometrial cancer find literature date , best investigator 's knowledge . The GE PET/MRI recently obtain Mayo , Rochester potential improve sensitivity detection metastatic disease , compare imaging modality , superior PET technology update Q Clear software . For reason reasonable expect improve sensitivity detect metastatic disease endometrial cancer , possibly prove PET/MRI superior modality preoperative screening potentially allow less morbid surgical management patient high risk endometrial cancer .</detailed_description>
