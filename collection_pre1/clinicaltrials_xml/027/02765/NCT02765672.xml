	<detailed_description>This research study do determine Occupational Therapy Driving intervention ( OT-DI ) improve safe drive performance immediately follow intervention intermediate term ( 3months ) . Baseline test post test1 include Clinical battery test Simulated Driving test , Brief Driving Questionnaire , Community Integration Questionnaire , Satisfaction Life Questionnaire . Caregivers/family member rate participant ' drive behavior use Fitness-to-Drive Screening Measure ( FTDS ) . After baseline test 260 participant ( associated caregiver ) randomly assign balance intervention control group . The intervention group receive Occupational Therapy Driving Intervention ( OT-DI ) consist three x 1hour session include Sessions1 : Driving evaluator review explicit drive error participant ; Session 2 : Driving evaluator provide tailored strategy mitigate error ; Session 3 : Participants drive simulator target feedback drive evaluator . The control group receive drive safety professional , three x 1 hour general safety session ( session 1 : general traffic safety discussion ; Session 2 : Rules road acknowledgement road discussion ; Session 3 : drive simulator without feedback drive safety professional ) . Immediately session 3 , Post test1 occur use standardize protocol outline baseline test . Post test2 : consist test standardize protocol administer baseline testing . Caregivers/family member rate participant drive behavior use FTDS addition investigator obtain drive data Department Motor Vehicles include citation , violation , drive mishap occur participant . To ascertain impact OT-DI driving safety education real world driving , subset 30 participant create control intervention group perform on-road drive test . The result test compare drive performance simulate drive .</detailed_description>
