	<detailed_description>In response National Institutes Health 's call empirically-supported model implement research-tested health behavior change intervention , investigator test 3-step ( prepare , roll-out , sustain ) Community Implementation Model ( Model ) low-resource African community . The Model adapt theory-based model effective implement hospital-based intervention South Africa . Its participatory approach , clear step , observable benchmark multimedia Toolkit facilitate community ownership build capacity use Model fidelity . The investigator test whether community member use Model effectively implement peer group HIV prevention intervention call Mzake ndi Mzake ( Friend Friend ) fidelity effectiveness . Developed test among several population Malawi ( R01-NR08058 ) , This intervention efficacious rural , central Malawi .

Aim 2 ) Identify implementation pattern across site time , evaluate use mixed-methods integrate benchmark observation , focus group , interview . Aim 3 ) Assess community ' effectiveness use Model implement Mzake , evaluate stepped wedge design ( N = 864 ) . Analysis use multi-level hierarchical model detect improvement time HIV-related behavioral outcome biomarkers sexually transmit infection participant receive intervention compare delayed-intervention control group . Aim 4 ) Evaluate whether Model feasible , acceptable , effective sustainable use community implement Mzake , examine integrate data Aims 1-3 . If successful , study advance implementation science provide replicable evidence-based model implementation HIV prevention intervention health intervention low-resource community .</detailed_description>
