	<detailed_description>Recent study show intestinal microbiota consist thousand bacteria , microorganism play role balance continuity anatomical functional integrity gastrointestinal tract . Chronic disease , nutritional factor , lifestyle factor medication include antibiotic change host microbiota short long-term period . Antibiotics commonly use drug pediatrics routine practice . Although frequency severity side effect alter choice drug , mild complication may take consideration treatment physician profit loss balance . Antibiotic-associated diarrhea one side effect occur antibiotic use , frequency varies accord region antibiotic type . Aminopenicillins , cephalosporin clindamycin antibiotic identify affected group antibiotic-associated diarrhea . Development antibiotic associate diarrhea associate intestinal microbiota balance , mucosal integrity change vitamin / mineral metabolism 3 . Majority case antibiotic associate diarrhea admit complaint abdominal crampy pain diarrhea pseudomembranous enterocolitis , severe case , even death report . Antibiotic-associated diarrhea occur antibiotic treatment may see 2-3 week later termination treatment . Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent related 11-40 % antibiotic associate diarrhea case child . In Turkey large study frequency antibiotic associate diarrhea child , antibiotic commonly use drug class childhood . The use broad-spectrum antibiotic , creates risk narrow-spectrum antibiotic , high risk observe use clindamycin , cephalosporins fluoroquinolones . However , consensus antibiotic high risk significant negative impact microbiota . Antibiotic-associated diarrhea , show increase growth enteropathogens antibiotic use . In particular , Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) infection common infection relate antibiotic associate diarrhea 2 . Although C. difficile diarrhea mostly occur adult hospitalize immunocompromised patient , see child . C. difficile lead mild diarrhea pseudomembranous colitis accord toxin . C. difficile associate 10-20 % antibiotic-associated diarrhea form see eight week treatment antibiotic . Antibiotics disrupt integrity normal colonic mucosa , affect carbohydrate metabolism result antimicrobial activity colon lead development osmotic diarrhea pathogenic bacteria associate diarrhea . The slow metabolism carbohydrate result reduction short-chain fatty acid intestinal lumen cause accumulation carbohydrate absorb . Besides harm normal microbiota provide protective barrier intestinal system become sensitive resistant microorganism . Reduction intestinal lumen number Bacteroides Bifidobacteria strain facultative anaerobe ( Fusobacterium Clostridia , Eubacteria ) result increase . Antibiotic-associated diarrhea , alongside negative effect quality life host , cost treatment patient hospitalize hospital also negatively affect length stay . In case outpatient treatment , hospitalized patient , antibiotic treatment usually terminate change , affect success treatment case lead long stay hospital . Especially long-term hospitalization intensive care unit hospital cause increase risk nosocomial infection show cause mortality 14 . In case diarrhea patient treat ambulatory treatment patient 's symptom also decline , antibiotic treatment interrupt family . If case result use therefore bring physician physician broader spectrum antibiotic parenteral drug . In study probiotic , probiotic strain antibiotic-associated diarrhea development use combination antibiotic show significantly reduce . Harvard / Yale probiotic Workshop Group , World Gastroenterology Organization prevention antibiotic associate diarrhea probiotic strain show level evidence A1 . However , probiotic effect strain specific . Although Saccharomyces boulardii Lactobacillus GG well known strain prevention antibiotic associate diarrhea , knowledge Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 limit . Our study group ( PROBAGE Working Group ) recently show Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 reduce duration diarrhea child acute infectious diarrhea , safe well-tolerated . In study investigator aim evaluate potential effect Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 prevention antibiotic associate diarrhea child .</detailed_description>
