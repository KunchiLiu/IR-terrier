	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis Jetstream atherectomy ( JS ) adjunctive balloon angioplasty ( PTA ) ( JS +PTA ) improve target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) 6 month follow-up compare historic data PTA alone treatment femoropopliteal ( FP ) arterial In-stent restenotic ( ISR ) disease . This prospective , multicenter , single arm study evaluate investigational use Jetstream Atherectomy ( JS ) adjunctive balloon angioplasty ( JS +PTA ) treatment FP ISR lesion subject claudication limb ischemia ( Rutherford clinical category ( RCC ) 2-4 ) ( lesion length ≥ 4 cm ) . The comparator arm historic data plain old balloon angioplasty derive Meta-analysis 3 publish randomized trial field .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Boston Scientific Jetstream XC catheter rotating , aspirate , expandable catheter active removal atherosclerotic disease thrombus peripheral vasculature . The JS XC System clear Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use peripheral vasculature treat denovo non-stent infrainguinal lesion Several study show stenting FP artery lead high long term patency . Bare metal stent however show conclusively reducemTLR contrast drug coat balloon ( DCB ) drug coat stent ( DCS ) . Irrespective , stenting several disadvantage include continued high rate restenosis stent fracture progressive time . FP ISR occur one third patient 1 year 49 % 2 year . Complex lesion ( long , Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C/D lesion , total occlusion ) , certain demographic ( female gender , diabetes mellitus ) , critical limb ischemia significant stent fracture associate high rate restenosis . Also majority occlude stent restenotic-thrombotic generally challenge treat . Recently 3 randomized trial present treat FP ISR ; EXCImer Laser Randomized Controlled Study Treatment FemoropopliTEal In-Stent Restenosis ( EXCITE ISR ) trial ( randomize laser + PTA v PTA alone ) , RELINE trial ( Propaten Bioactive Surface vs. standard balloon angioplasty treatment in-stent restenosis superficial femoral artery ) Randomized Femoral Artery In-Stent Restenosis ( FAIR ) Trial . All study show superiority PTA treat FP ISR . Early animal data ( porcine model FP ISR ) feasibility human data ( JetStream ISR study ) show JetStream device effective ablate restenotic tissue within restenotic FP stent safety concern within well apposed stent absence Class III IV fracture . The purpose study assess estimate effect treat FP ISR plaque excision use JS combination adjunctive PTA compare historic control PTA . The comparator arm historic data PTA derive study-level meta-analysis 3 publish randomized trial field .</detailed_description>
