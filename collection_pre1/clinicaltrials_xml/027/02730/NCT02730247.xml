	<brief_summary>The subject take part clinical research study advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) previously treat drug . If join study , would receive ramucirumab ( Cyramza ® ) combination nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane® ) . Ramucirumab give nab-paclitaxel consider investigational drug combination use type cancer give two drug together approve regulatory authority like US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) NSCLC cancer . Ramucirumab work slow stop growth cancer cell . Nab-Paclitaxel work block ability cancer cell break internal 'skeleton ' allows divide multiply . With skeleton still place , cell divide eventually die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ramucirumab human IgG1 ( Immunoglobulin G ) monoclonal antibody target extracellular domain VEGFR-2 ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ) . A recent double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluate addition ramucirumab docetaxel compare docetaxel placebo patient Stage IV squamous non-squamous NSCLC 2nd-line treatment set . This study demonstrate superior overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall response rate ( ORR ) combination therapy compare docetaxel placebo . This effect see across histologic subtypes , absence excess toxicity patient squamous cell histology . This finding intriguing , prior study bevacizumab patient NSCLC squamous cell histology associate excess pulmonary hemorrhage . This provide rationale investigation ramucirumab patient squamous cell NSCLC . nab-Paclitaxel formulation paclitaxel complexed albumin readily soluble saline allow administration paclitaxel without use lipid-based solvent need corticosteroid antihistamine premedication . nab-Paclitaxel approve 1st line treatment NSCLC base trial demonstrate superior ORR addition nab-paclitaxel carboplatin compare carboplatin/paclitaxel patient advance metastatic NSCLC , well prolonged PFS OS without statistical significance . The subgroup analysis tumor histology demonstrate statistically significant advantage nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin term best overall response rate ( 41 % vs 24 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) , numerically good PFS OS squamous NSCLC . [ 3 ] This single-arm phase II clinical trial , patient previously treat NSCLC treat ramucirumab/nab-paclitaxel disease progression , unacceptable treatment-related toxicity withdrawal consent primary endpoint progression-free survival . A minimum 40 patient squamous cell histology require determination co-primary endpoint . The investigator hypothesize addition ramucirumab nab-paclitaxel well-tolerated associate superior PFS compare single agent taxane-based therapy .</detailed_description>
