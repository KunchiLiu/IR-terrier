	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Food-effect Study Abiraterone Acetate ( AA ) Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abiraterone acetate ( AA ) approve treatment mCRPC docetaxel progression dose 1.000 mg per day take fasting condition . However , describe significant food-effect bioavailability 5 10 time folder increase depend fat content diet . These data come analysis small number patient phase I study conduct early stage drug development exploratory study healthy subject . There prospective randomized study analyze real impact normal diet bioavailability drug ( fatty diet like use initial study ) . Given particular epidemiology mCRPC ( relatively frequent pathology ) , take account recent data indicates positive result AA treatment patient previously receive chemotherapy , significant use drug anticipate uro-oncology community come year . The precise definition dose accord food-effect bioavailability may critical purely medical perspective / pharmacological even socioeconomic impact health system . The hypothesis study prove AA administer reduce dos standard diet present suitable pharmacokinetic profile would achieve therapeutic level blood , regimens low currently approve association food use future study efficacy .</detailed_description>
