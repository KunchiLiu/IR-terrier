	<detailed_description>`` Increasing rate highly malignant hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) biliary tract cancer ( GBTC ) observe Western population may relate obesogenic lifestyle factor metabolic consequence , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) , inflammation alter production bile acid ( BA ) . Such lifestyle behaviour may induce change gut microflora turn affect BA profile , increase carcinogenicity . Some elevate BA may oncogenic expose liver , bile duct gall bladder . Data case-control study show high blood BA patient various liver disease , design unclear difference BA level etiologic consequential . To date prospective study investigate role circulate BA level development HCC/GBTC , potential interaction diet , obesity MetS . Interestingly , Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy ( VSG ) , anti-obesity intervention , may alter BA profile patient towards potentially detrimental composition , largely unexplored . Project description : This project compose two complementary study design explore role BA obesity , liver function tumourigenesis . The 1st study case-control study hepatobiliary cancer ( 191 HCC ; 266 GBTC ; 457 match control ) nest within large prospective cohort Franco-European population ( EPIC , &gt; 520,000 subject ) extensive detailed dietary/lifestyle data , body size measure biological sample take baseline prior disease development . The aim study explore association pre-diagnostic MetS marker BA level risk HCC GBTC , establish whether observed association modulate , part , dietary/lifestyle factor metabolic dysfunction . The 2nd study base clinical setting aim recruit 100 morbidly obese subject undergo VSG compare BA metabolic profile pre- 1 year post-surgery . This study base observation post-VSG BA synthesis increase , change BA composition towards possibly harmful profile previously study . It also hypothesize degree weight loss metabolic improvement VSG patient may relate pre-surgical BA profile . In study , comprehensive panel 17 serum BA ( primary , secondary , ( un ) -conjugated , sulphated ) metabolic biomarkers ( inflammation , liver function , dyslipidemia , HbA1c , MetS indicator , hepatitis status ) assess use validate method . Study 2 also assess expression liver FXR , BA receptor gene . Statistical Methods : Study 1 calculate odds ratios 95 % confidence interval circulate BA levels/MetS marker relation HCC GBTC risk multivariable conditional logistic regression , control potential confounding variable effect modifier . Receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) analyse performed assess combination BA metabolic marker best performance prospectively distinguish cancer case control . In study 2 , GLM ( repeat measure ) ANOVA use compare pre-/post-surgery change biomarkers . BA profile study , compare correlation BA biomarkers , lifestyle body size measure assess . Expected result : This project base two related concept . First , lifestyle behaviour obesity may alter gut microflora lead change BA metabolism , enhance production specific BA known cancer promote . Second , observation increase BA level post-VSG surgery , may improve metabolic function , BA may pro-carcinogenic long term . The project provide improve understanding inter-relations BA , lifestyle behaviour metabolic factor development hepatobiliary cancer . It also identify specific BA strongly associate highly malignant cancer . The finding contribute evidence base advice lifestyle metabolic modification cancer prevention . The clinical implication two-fold . First , finding provide insight whether BA profile predictive efficacy VSG potential implication personalize medicine , second , identified biomarker profile may use refine risk stratification development cancer subsequent close patient ' surveillance early detection ``</detailed_description>
