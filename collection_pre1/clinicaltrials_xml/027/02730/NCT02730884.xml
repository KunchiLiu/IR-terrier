	<brief_title>Single-Arm Study Efficacy Safety Oral Rigosertib Patients With Myelofibrosis ( MF ) Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take rigosertib capsule mouth 2 time day ( 1 morning dose , 1 afternoon dose ) 48 week . You take morning dose empty stomach . Your afternoon dose take 3:00 pm ( ±1 hour ) , least 2 hour lunch . You fast least 1 hour dose . You drink least ½ gallon water day . Rigosertib refrigerate . You also give study drug diary . You write dose study drug take , take , miss vomit dos . If miss vomit dose rigosertib , make dose . You take next schedule dose plan . Every 3 week 12 week , every 6 week thereafter , bring leftover rigosertib capsule study drug diary clinic . Study Visits : You need fast blood draw study . The doctor tell long need fast . On Cycle 1 Day 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test 1 hour dose study drug . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - You complete questionnaire quality life . It take 10-15 minute . - If doctor think need , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan check status disease . Each week , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If study doctor approves , may weekly blood draw local lab closer home . The result routine test send study doctor . On Day 1 Week 4 , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn PK test 1 hour dose study drug . At Weeks 24 48 ( ± 1 week ) : - You bone marrow aspirate/biopsy perform check status disease . This sample may also use cytogenetic testing . - If CT/MRI scan perform Week 1 , another CT/MRI scan check status disease . - If become pregnant , urine collect pregnancy test . Every 4 week Week 12 every 8 week : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You complete questionnaire quality life . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 48 week . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If doctor think best interest , may able continue take study drug 48 week . The study doctor discus . Your participation study end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : About 4 week last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You need fast blood draw . The study doctor tell long need fast . This routine blood urine collection also include pregnancy test become pregnant . This investigational study . Rigosertib FDA-approved commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 35 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
