	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate clinical effect addition metronomic oral vinorelbine letrozole anastrozole . The study compare efficacy tolerability oral metronomic vinorelbine administer combination letrozole anastrozole , treatment hormone receptor-positive advanced metastatic breast cancer without resistance Aromatase Inhibitors ( AI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Open Study Metronomic Oral Vinorelbine Combination With Aromatase Inhibitors Treatment Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor Positive , HER2-negative , Advanced Breast Cancer Who Received Prior Therapy Advanced Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Letrozole Anastrozole AI generally use first line therapy woman HR+ breast cancer . Furthermore , present hormonal treatment advance breast cancer ( ABC ) Metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) sub-optimal , approximately one half patient oestrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive tumour respond therapy . For patient population , chemotherapy valid option , especially failure intolerance hormone therapy . Both combination sequential single-agent chemotherapy reasonable option . Based available data , sequential monotherapy recommend preferred choice MBC . Preferred first-line chemotherapy single agent anthracyclines , taxanes , capecitabine , gemcitabine vinorelbine . The development oral chemotherapy formulation offer numerous benefit patient , oncologist , oncology nurse , pharmacist healthcare provider Metronomic therapy ( MT ) refers repetitive , low dos chemotherapy drug . MT exert effect tumor cell , also microenvironment . In particular , low-dose schedule compromise repair process endothelial cell , lead anti-angiogenic effect . A systematic review result phase I , II III study suggest MT treatment option breast cancer patient , low toxicity profile , efficacy patient potentially significant cost-effective advantage public health .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient sign informed consent trial related activity accord local guideline Women advance ( inoperable loco regionally recurrent metastatic ) breast cancer No prior systemic anticancer therapy advance disease . Patient postmenopausal . Postmenopausal status define either : Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age &gt; 60 Age &lt; 60 amenorrhea 12 month ( absence chemotherapy , tamoxifen , ovarian suppression ) and/or FSH estradiol postmenopausal range per local normal range Patient histological and/or cytological confirm diagnosis estrogenreceptor positive and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer local laboratory ( determine &gt; 10 % positive stain cell estrogen receptor IHC primary tumor metastatic site whichever value progesterone receptor ) . Patient HER2negative breast cancer define negative situ hybridization test IHC status 0 , 1+ 2+ . If IHC 2+ , negative situ hybridization ( FISH , CISH , SISH ) test require local laboratory test . Patient must either : Measurable disease , i.e. , least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criterion , At least one lytic bone lesion . Non measurable disease Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 Patient adequate bone marrow organ function define follow laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL Normal calcium ( correct serum albumin ) Serum creatinine 2 x ULN In absence liver metastasis , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) 2.5 × ULN . If patient liver metastasis , ALT AST &lt; 5 × ULN . Total serum bilirubin &lt; ULN ; total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 × ULN direct bilirubin within normal range central laboratory patient well document Gilbert 's Syndrome Life expectancy &gt; 16 week Patient receive vinorelbine adjuvant setting . Patient known hypersensitivity oral vinorelbine , létrozole , Anastrozole excipients others vincaalcaloïdes . 3 . Patient receive prior anticancer therapy ( include chemotherapy ) advance disease exception surgery . Note : • Patients receive ( neo ) adjuvant therapy breast cancer eligible . Prior therapy letrozole anastrozole ( neo ) adjuvant set permit disease free interval great 24 month completion treatment . Patient concurrent malignancy malignancy within 5 year randomization , exception adequately treat , basal squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer curatively resect cervix cancer . Patient known CNS metastasis . Patient impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) Patient know history HIV infection ( test mandatory ) Patient concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , investigator 's judgment , contraindicate patient participation clinical study ( e.g . chronic pancreatitis , chronic active hepatitis , etc . ) Patient active cardiac disease history cardiac dysfunction include follow : History angina pectoris , symptomatic pericarditis , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry History document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) Documented cardiomyopathy Patient peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 2 CTCAE version 4.0 Patient major surgery within 14 day prior start study drug recover major side effect Patient concurrently use antineoplastic agent . Patient receive radiotherapy palliation ≤ 2 week prior randomization , recover grade 1 well related side effect therapy ( exception alopecia ) and/or ≥ 30 % bone marrow irradiate . Participation another clinical trial investigational drug within 30 day prior randomization and/or study . Pregnancy lactate patient Patient history surgical resection extend stomach small intestine Patient severe infection current recent ( within 2 week ) Patient need longterm oxygen therapy Patient rare hereditary problem fructose intolerance In combination vaccine yellow fever</criteria>
