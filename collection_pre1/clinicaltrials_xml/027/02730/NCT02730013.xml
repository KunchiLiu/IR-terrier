	<brief_summary>This 3 month cluster randomize control trial use square-stepping exercise program ( a.k.a . mind-motor exercise ) retirement long-term care residence improve global cognitive function old adult without cognitive impairment . The investigator intend project pragmatic therefore include resident dementia walk aid participant wish participate . The primary outcome global cognitive functioning , secondary outcome include : single dual task gait ( complete without dementia ) , oculomotor functioning , functional fitness . The investigator hypothesize improvement primary secondary outcome intervention group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Square Stepping Exercise ( SSE ) best describe visuospatial work memory task , step response thus may consider cognitive-physical exercise alternatively type mind-motor exercise . The SSE program develop specifically improve balance low extremity function thereby prevent disability institutionalization older adult recent evidence also suggest may positively impact cognitive functioning . Through investigator ' collaboration Dr. Mike Sharratt , President Schlegel-University Waterloo Research Institute Aging , Jaimie Killingbeck , Program Active Living Coordinator Schlegel Villages , Susan Brown , Research Coordinator Schlegel-University Waterloo Research Institute Aging study aim : assess feasibility square-stepping exercise amongst old adult variety cognitive ability , increase collaborative effort broader community engage old adult physical activity improve global cognitive function mind-motor exercise intervention . This study cluster randomize controlled trial , stratify long-term care full continuum care 4 Schlegel Villages involve , blind . The investigator stratify 1 long-term care 1 full continuum randomize begin square-stepping program immediately , 1 long-term care 1 full continuum care randomize usual-care wait list control group , begin program 12-week measurement complete . The facility stratify help balance baseline cognition intervention control group . The 4 facility : Long-term Care - Glendale Crossings St. Claire ; Full continuum Care - Tansley Woods Winston Park . The site pre-randomized allow facility time prepare program schedule include square-stepping exercise resident . Intervention sit include Glendale Crossings Tansley Woods wait-list control sit include St. Claire Winston Park . Outcomes assessment complete graduate student research assistant project . The assessment complete Villages . The Schlegel Villages staff Kinesiologists/ Exercise Therapists implement square-stepping exercise program 12 week period . Study staff train Schlegel Villages staff implement program .</detailed_description>
