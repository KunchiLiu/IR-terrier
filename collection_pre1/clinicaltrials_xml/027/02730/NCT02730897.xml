	<brief_summary>Five paper show low N1 nodal upstage video-assisted thoracic surgery ( VATS ) compare open surgery patient cStage-I NSCLC . This finding question oncologic quality minimal invasive lung cancer surgery , especially quality hilar intrapulmonary lymh node dissection . However , retrospective study include analysis central tumor location , although central tumor report high chance N1 upstaging . Possibly , create selection bias surgeon might select central lesion deliberately open surgery line initial VATS feasibility report</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicentric Analysis Predictors N1 Upstaging After Resection cStage-I NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After optimal preoperative staging , 10 25 % patient clinical stage I ( cStage-I ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) find unforeseen positive lymph node resection . Central tumor , even small 3cm ( cT1 ) , high incidence intrapulmonary hilar ( N1 ) ipsilateral mediastinal ( N2 ) lymph node involvement comparison peripheral lesion . In cohort patient underwent identical preoperative mediastinal evaluation postoperative pathologic tissue examination equal quality , nodal upstaging use quality indicator oncologic thoracic surgery . Or , use instrument compare different technique , thoracoscopic ( VATS ) versus open lung resection lung cancer . Five paper show low N1 nodal upstage video-assisted thoracic surgery ( VATS ) compare open surgery . These retrospective study include tumor location . The investigator hypothesize creates bias surgeon might choose open approach tumor centrally locate . This line initial feasibility report guideline exclude patient central lesion . This result high prevalence positive N1 node patient operate open approach . Our single centre analysis show one three chance nodal upstaging central locate cStage-I tumor , multivariate analysis show central location significant predictor upstaging , surgical technique . The aim multicentric study investigate risk factor nodal upstaging , include tumor location , patient cStage-I NSCLC validate previous finding .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients operated 2014 NSCLC final pathology cStageI ( cT12a cN0 cM0 ) start incision anatomical resection . This include : open/VATS/ Robotic Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery ( RATS ) This include : lobectomy , bilobectomy , sleeve pneumonectomy ( wedge ) Higher clinical stage cStageI Former therapy lung cancer ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery ) Metastatic disease Induction chemo radiotherapy Nonanatomical resection ( wedge ) Previous lymph node disease No positron emission tomography ( PET ) Missing PET report</criteria>
