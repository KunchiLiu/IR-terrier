	<brief_summary>The present study carry evaluate efficacy intra-articular 0.5 bupivacaine intra-articular intravenous alpha-2agonist ; Dexmedetomidine ; intraoperative anesthesia postoperative analgesia arthroscopic knee surgery . Arthroscopic knee surgery one common minimally invasive orthopedic procedure recent practice frequently perform day surgery procedure . It do general , regional local anesthesia ( LA ) without sedation . It associate vary amount postoperative pain . Postoperative pain negatively influence patient 's early ambulation , rehabilitation psychology consecutively prolonged hospital stay . Intra-articular administration local anesthetic knee arthroscopy well-documented procedure offer many advantage anesthesia type . Many anesthesiologist still try improve technique local anesthetic administration use many combination LA solution order administer safe anesthesia patient obtain pain-free knee good operating condition . Dexmedetomidine highly selective α2 adrenergic agonist . It analgesic , sedative , anxiolytic , hypnotic , sympatholytic , antihypertensive property anesthetic spar effect . It become attractive alternative current opioids respiratory depressant addictive effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient keep fast midnight receive midazolam 5 mg orally premedication . All patient premedicated I.V . midazolam 0.03 mg/kg ten minute start operation . The anesthetic technique standardize patient . All surgical procedure perform surgeon consist arthroscopic removal torn meniscus . Both intra-articular intravenous solution prepare individual involved study intra-articular drug inject surgeon ( without know content ) . The anesthesiologist manage monitoring patient throughout surgery provide IV drug . No leg holder tourniquet surgical drain use case . After preparation drape patient 's leg , patient warn prior needle stick decrease anxiety . All procedure perform complete aseptic condition . Skin subcutaneous tissue arthroscopic portal site anesthetize LA consist injection mixture 2 % lidocaine 5 mL 1:200,000 epinephrine . Care take avoid infiltration fat pad . It relatively aneural structure ; , much local infiltration allow bulge joint surgery . Flexion extension knee joint several time help spread intra-articular solution wait 20 minute anesthesia take effect helpful surgical incision . The arthroscope insert knee , inflow sheath establish . No pump use saline inflow maintain arthroscope gravity . Gravity outflow drain superolateral portal . A separate egress cannula use indicate . The patient encourage view video monitor procedure . Constant verbal communication surgeon patient important throughout arthroscopic examination surgery . This keep patient anxiety muscle tension minimum facilitate manipulation leg thorough examination entire joint . Once finishing , instrument remove portal close 4-0 absorbable suture subcutaneously steri-strips . A compression dress apply three day knee .</detailed_description>
