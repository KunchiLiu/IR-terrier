	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Optimal Dosage Equivalence Between Lcr Regenerans® Capsules Tablets ( Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Lcr35® ) Vaginal Flora Colonisation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The healthy vaginal microbiota mainly colonise strain Lactobacillus play important role defence vaginal infection . The intravaginal use probiotic strain stimulate recolonisation endogenous vaginal microbiota capable inhibit growth pathogen Candida albicans appear interesting alternative prevent recurrence VVC . Recently , longitudinal study reveal vaginal microbiota relatively stable main cause disturbance stability vaginal microbiota short menstruation period . However , use antimicrobial agent induces severe disturbance disappearance certain endogenous specie several week . These result suggest antimicrobial treatment severely affect vaginal flora probiotic therefore recommend help re-establish vaginal microbiota treatment . For , sufficient direct local supply must provide . The general data study vaginal microbiota reveal healthy woman , concentration Lactobacilli great equal 107 CFU/ml vaginal secretion . During capsule administration , Lactobacilli immediately release vaginal cavity . The natural vaginal secretion , estimate average 0.51 ml/day , result daily elimination around 107 108 CFU therefore generate rapid elimination supply require daily administration . The objective clinical trial prove two dosage form , capsule administer daily tablet administer certain dosage , enable equivalent local provision concentration great equal 10e7 CFU ( concentration ensure establishment sufficiently large bacterial population enable efficacy product ) . Therefore , optimal dosage Lcr Regenerans® tablet administer equivalent daily administration Lcr Regenerans® capsule determine trial . To , 3 different dosage Lcr Regenerans® tablet , correspond encompass time tablet provide continuous release presence strain vitro model , compare Lcr Regenerans® capsule . For reason , frequency administration Lcr Regenerans® tablet 3 , 4 5 day .</detailed_description>
