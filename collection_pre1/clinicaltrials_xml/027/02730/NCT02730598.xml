	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis knee ( KOA ) common cause disability old adult . Osteoarthritis involve loss cartilage , act like cushion bone well change bone joint . Once joint cartilage go , body produce new cartilage . Joint damage contribute pain . Currently , treatment pain associate knee osteoarthritis include exercise . However , exercise medium- high-intensity level problematic people knee pain . Because exercise common treatment knee pain many people experience pain exercise , researcher hope find safe effective exercise method strengthen muscle around knee . Both aerobic exercise resistance exercise recommend treatment people knee pain . However , pain barrier participate exercise moderate vigorous intensity . Electrical stimulation muscle hold potential allow effective exercise complete tolerable intensity . Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) use low electric current produce device stimulate nerve , treat pain . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) use low electrical current cause muscle contract . By study , investigator hope learn hybrid training system ( HTS ) , use combination NMES walking , effective strengthening muscle people knee pain , ache stiffness . In pilot study , investigator use walk TENS conventional exercise . Randomized control trial conduct compare effect walk augment HTS walk without HTS . The investigator evaluate relative advantage train combine HTS conventional walking exercise improvement muscle strength , physical function , pain relief obese woman frequent knee symptom . Study Hypotheses : Compared walk sensory TENS , walk HTS : - 1 increase quadriceps muscle strength . - 2 decrease knee pain . Exploratory Hypotheses : - 3 improve physical function . - 4 increase PPT ( improve central sensitization ) . - 5 improve self-reported quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis knee ( KOA ) common cause disability United States also Japan . KOA associate pain , quadriceps weakness , swell , instability , decline range motion , physical function , quality life ( QOL ) ( 1 ) . In particular , quadriceps weakness may contribute incident symptomatic progressive disease ( 2 , 3 ) , cause functional limitation disability ( 4 ) increase risk mortality ( 5 ) . Both aerobic exercise resistance exercise recommend treatment people knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) ( 6 ) . However , exercise moderate severe intensity often problem people knee pain history knee injury . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) widely use method increase muscle strength improve physical function even low-moderate exercise intensity ( 7 ) . However , NMES effect may prove insufficient exercise intensity determine electrical stimulation endurance level user ( 7 ) . On hand , transcutaneous electrical stimulation , so-called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , effective pain relief ( 8 ) . Knee pain independently reduce quadriceps strength activation ( 9 ) . TENS restore inhibited quadriceps motor function ( central muscle activation ) pain relief ( 10 ) . Moreover combined application electrical stimulation ( ES ) volitional contraction ( VC ) say effective ES VC alone ( 11 ) . Therefore , hybrid training system ( HTS ) resist motion volitionally contract agonist muscle use force generate electrically stimulate antagonist ( NMES ) develop way combine application electrical stimulation voluntary contraction ( 12 ) . HTS method eliminate disadvantage volitional exercise NMES ( 13 ) . It report HTS new training technique increase muscular strength muscle mass ( 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ) . Recently , HTS show promise countermeasure musculoskeletal disuse astronauts HTS technique generate exercise resistance within body even gravity ( 1 ) . In addition , HTS utilize many different type exercise ( e.g . knee extension exercise , squat hip flexion , walk exercise , cycle exercise ) ( 17 , 18 ) . It seem effective improvement muscle strength physical function combine HTS easy exercise ( e.g . knee extension , walking , squat ) KOA patient . The main purpose exercise therapy KOA muscular strength improvement ( quadriceps femoris muscle particular ) also pain relief ( 19 , 20 ) . Muscular strength improvement protect joint relief nociceptive stimulation . However , exercise sometimes increase pain . In addition pathological change articular structure , change central pain processing central sensitization appear involve KOA pain ( 19 ) . Murphy et al . report 36 % heterogenous sample patient hip KOA demonstrate evidence central sensitization ( 22 ) . This find incompletely characterize , necessary consider central sensitization treatment patient KOA . From theoretical perspective , exercise potential treat process central sensitization : e.g . exercise activate brain-orchestrated endogenous analgesia ( 23 ) . An initial bout high intensity eccentric exercise induces central sensitization , repeat round exercise facilitate inherent protective spinal mechanism ( repeat bout effect ) ( 24 ) . Moreover , ipsilateral resistance exercise may possibly prevent central sensitization ( 25 ) . Therefore , time-contingent approach implies patient cease exercise bouts local pain severity increase recommend ( 22 ) . A report dysfunctional endogenous analgesia patient musculoskeletal pain response aerobic exercise show , neither type aerobic exercise able activate endogenous analgesia ( 24 ) . At present , report exercise method effective central sensitization pain patient . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) belong neurotrophic family growth factor . The loss BDNF usually lead neurodegeneration motor center eventually result several severe motor disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , spinocerebellar ataxia , Parkinson 's disease , Huntington 's disease , well vestibular syndrome . These neurotrophic factor ( e.g. , decrease brain-derived neurotrophic factor ) promise new avenue diminish hyperexcitability CNS central sensitization pain patient ( 2 ) . Da Graca-Tarrago et al . show 30-minute electrical intramuscular stimulation osteoarthritis decrease pain , increase local pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) , decrease BDNF ( 27 ) . Gajewska-Wozniak et al . report low-threshold electrical stimulation peripheral nerve stimulate Ia afferent fiber ( proprioceptive signaling ) might affect expression BDNF rat ( 28 ) . HTS exercise technique use electrically eccentric muscle contraction . Yamaguchi et al . show soleus H-reflex increase one HTS adversely conventional resistance exercise ( 29 ) . This seem indicate HTS serve activate Ia fiber . HTS may affect central sensitization relieve pain KOA patient .</detailed_description>
