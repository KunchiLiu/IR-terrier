	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial study side effect best way give pembrolizumab combination chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery see well work treat adult patient gastroesophageal junction gastric cardia cancer spread start nearby tissue remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving pembrolizumab , combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

( Phase Ib re-initiated ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify tissue and/or circulate biomarkers associate pathCR , DFS , clinical outcome patient locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma treat neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy . II . To determine difference pre-treatment vs post-treatment tissue expression immune marker , include program death ligand ( PDL ) 1 tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( cluster differentiation [ CD ] 8+ , forkhead box P3 [ FOXP3 ] + regulatory cell [ Tregs ] , CD45RO , granzyme B ) , patient treat neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy . III . To identify immune marker pretreatment tissue correlate pathCR long-term outcome patient treat neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy . IV . To explore whether Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -associated tumor molecular profile associate pathCR long-term outcome patient treat neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy . V. To explore whether microsatellite-unstable ( MSI ) tumor molecular profile associate pathCR long-term outcome patient treat neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy . OUTLINE : NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 22 , 43 carboplatin IV paclitaxel IV 1-96 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 29 . Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily ( QD ) 5 day per week 4 week 3 day ( 23 fraction ) . Patients progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute , paclitaxel IV 1-96 hour , carboplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2-4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT ( RE-INITIATED ) : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 22 oxaliplatin IV 2-6 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 15 minute 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 22 , oxaliplatin IV 2-6 hour , leucovorin calcium 15 minute 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 , 15 , 29 . Treatment repeat every 41 day ( 6 week ) 1-3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : Within 5-8 week completion radiation therapy 3-6 week completion chemotherapy patient receive chemotherapy alone , patient undergo curative-intent surgery . ADJUVANT TREATMENT : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute every 21 day . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
