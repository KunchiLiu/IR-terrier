	<brief_title>Aztreonam Aerosol Treat Cystic Fibrosis Nasal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design explore efficacy safety nasal aztreonam administer use Pari Sinus Nebulizer combine oral Cayston aerosol therapy compare placebo clinical laboratory endpoint risk antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) , time pulmonary infection exacerbation , nasal quality life , pulmonary function , nasal low airway culture , property mucus . P. aeruginosa ( PA ) primary cause lung infection person cystic fibrosis ( CF ) ( 1 ) . Over past decade , study show aerosolized antibiotic reduce low respiratory bacterial load , decrease exacerbation pulmonary disease , many patient improve pulmonary function . Cayston ( aztreonam ) oral aerosol use PARI Altera Nebulizer System approve FDA February 2010 CF patient 7 year age old PA ( 2 ) . In 2011 , 35.8 % patient National CF Patient Registry use Cayston treatment ( 3 ) . Bacterial culture suggest upper airway low airway CF patient cross-infected PA paranasal sinuses act bacterial reservoir ( 4 ) . There improved post-transplanation patient survival recipient undergo sinus surgery daily nasal wash reduce bacterial load ( 2 ) . Routine CF care generally include upper airway assessment . There publish study evaluate effect aerosol antibiotic treat nasal sinus infection CF combination oral inhale aerosol therapy treat low airway disease . However Mainz colleague publish case report suggest sinonasal administration tobramycin use Pari Sinus nebulizer ( Pari Corp , Starnberg , Germany ) delay PA low respiratory infection 12 year-old CF chronic mucopurulent rhinosinusitis ( 5 ) study chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggest treat upper airway also improve coexistent low airway disease .</detailed_description>
