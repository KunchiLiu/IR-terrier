	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase 2 study evaluate efficacy letrozole-palbociclib combination letrozole-placebo combination woman ER+ advance relapsed endometrial cancer . Stratification Patients stratify accord : 1 . Number prior line therapy ( primary advance disease vs. 1st relapse vs. ≥2 relapse ) 2 . Measurable vs. evaluable disease 3 . Prior use MPA/Megace Randomization 1:1 randomization The patient prior MPA/Megace treatment cap maximum 50 % . Study arm Patients randomize one two treatment arm : - Arm A : ( comparator ) letrozole-placebo combination therapy progression . - Arm B : ( experimental arm ) : Letrozole- palbociclib combination therapy progression</detailed_description>
