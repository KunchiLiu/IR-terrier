	<brief_title>Effect Thymoglobulin Versus Basiliximab Regulatory T Cell Function Live Donor Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim study effect two standard-of-care immunosuppression induction regimens regulatory T cell ( Treg ) live donor renal transplant recipient . These two regimen use anti-T cell antibody : thymoglobulin polyclonal anti-T cell preparation basiliximab monoclonal anti-CD25 antibody . Both currently use hospital early immunosuppression induction effect Treg number function well understood may impact long term immune function . The investigator wish study effect standard regimen Treg number , function , FoxP3 methylation status ( indicator Treg function ) . Live donor renal transplant patient panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) low risk early allograft rejection various transplant center treat anti-T cell immunosuppression induction induction thymoglobulin basiliximab standard care . Most patient hospital receive thymoglobulin basiliximab use well . There proven long term benefit either approach seem low risk short term acute cellular rejection . Both agent show affect number Tregs ( T cell subset ) data exist duration effect effect agent Treg potency Treg FoxP3 methylation status . Since Tregs believe important long term control immune response , possible reason agent improve long term result spite short term improvement rejection rate due effect Treg . T cell depletion antibody become standard care majority renal transplant program country ( include Penn ) may reduce short term acute rejection episode within first year transplant . There unfortunately correspond improvement long term outcome , fact , average half life renal graft minimally change 2010 compare 1995 . This attribute unresolved issue diagnose treat describe `` chronic allograft nephropathy '' - real term , probably longstanding chronic rejection may part due mixed T B cell antigraft response . Despite fact agent use regularly clinical transplantation , little known effect regulatory T cell ( Treg ) number suppressive activity nothing know effect methylation status Tregs , seem correlate function . These novel question ) relevant clinical practice since agent use renal transplantation already , b ) may yield information could alter best practice , c ) yield basic information Tregs human transplantation relevant future study . There paper look predominantly immunosuppressive agent number Tregs ( low quality statistic since marker Tregs share cell type thus `` number '' hard interpret ) little function methylation . The investigator propose randomize 30 live donor kidney recipient receive either thymoglobulin basiliximab immunosuppression thereafter receive standard care maintenance immunosuppression determine clinical team . Both regimen use standard care hospital . The investigator enroll patient low immunological risk ( 0-10 % PRA ) receive ABO compatible transplant . After initial randomization , decision regard immunosuppression make clinical team independent study . The investigator draw blood sample pre-transplant , 3 month transplant , 6 month 12 month transplant .</detailed_description>
