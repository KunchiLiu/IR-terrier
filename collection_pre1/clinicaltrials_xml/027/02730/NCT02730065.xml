	<detailed_description>Cerebral small vessel disease ( SVD ) manifest age-related white matter lesion ( WML ) lacunar infarct brain imaging . SVD prevalent elderly population . In community dwell person ≥ 60 year age , quarter lacunar infarcts 96 % vary degree WML . Significant SVD , namely early confluent confluent WML multiple lacunar infarct , find 1 every 5 elderly person . In previous study find Chinese prone develop significant SVD Caucasians . SVD associate plethora age-related disability dementia , fall , depression , impaired daily function death Cognition - SVD common cause vascular cognitive impairment ( VCI ) vascular dementia , second prevalent type dementia . Community elderly person SVD two-fold increase risk develop dementia compare without . SVD may direct damage neural structure , disrupt connectivity cause atrophy brain region important cognitive functioning . Depression - Disconnection frontosubcortical pathway SVD contribute late-life depression , increase comorbidity depression SVD observe old population . Depression contribute poor quality life death old person . Physical impairment - increase severity SVD associate poor physical function include poor gait balance . SVD strong risk factor fall , major contribute factor disability death old person . In summary , non-disabled older adult SVD high risk multiple disability . As elderly population Hong Kong project triple next 30 year , mean prevent age-related disability cognitive decline , depression physical impairment vulnerable individual enormous importance patient , family healthcare system . Existing preventive therapy mainly involve medication control vascular risk factor associate SVD . Primary prevention mean lifestyle intervention therefore utmost importance . Evidence effect physical activity upon cognition , mood physical function The health value physical activity well recognize . Physical activity perform anybody time place minimal cost . Physical activity show improve clinical condition associate SVD . For cognition , physical activity associate reduce risk cognitive decline normal cognitively impaired elderly person . Aerobic strength training improved executive function , memory general cognitive function community-dwelling adult mild cognitive impairment . The investigator show large cohort ( n=1,013 ) stroke patient free dementia stroke , participation regular physical activity reduce 79 % risk incident dementia stroke . With regard mechanism , physical activity may improve endothelial function blood perfusion neuroplasticity brain region mediate cognitive function . Moreover , physical exercise may protect cognition reduce incident stroke , particular relevant people SVD due increase risk stroke . A randomized control trial ( RCT ) show 24-week , 3 x 50-minute per week moderate intensity exercise intervention significantly improve cognitive function patient risk AD , outcome effect size superior report drug treatment another study . Moreover , treatment benefit persist least one year active intervention , suggest physical exercise associate enduring change neurological substrate underpin cognitive functioning . However , study recruit patient likely degenerative ( Alzheimer 's ) pathology . For mood , physical activity may protect depression old adult . For physical function , investigator previously show physical exercise training improve balance , gait performance , exercise endurance quality life local patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . Taken together , good evidence physical activity improve many negative consequence cerebral SVD . Possible biological mechanism underlie physical exercise SVD The development SVD hypothesize related endothelial dysfunction result chronic hypertension impair cerebral vasomotor reactivity ( CVR ) , marker cerebral autoregulation . Changes CVR may reflect impairment homeostasis blood pressure brain , hence cerebral perfusion become dependent systemic blood pressure . Ischemia occur response drop systemic blood pressure lead hypoperfusion subsequently development SVD . Using Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasonography , group previously show decreased CVR associate SVD . Reduced CVR link cognitive decline , depression poor physical function elderly person . Physical exercise may lead significant improvement CVR . These data suggest physical exercise likely benefit cognition , mood physical function person SVD due positive effect CVR . Dancing mean physical activity intervention Dance rhythmic movement usually perform music . To many , pleasurable activity take hobby social activity therefore engagement self-sustaining . It minimal-cost perform even old person physical cognitive impairment . Dancing involves movement body limbs physical training . It also involve memory , attention , sensory stimulation , social interaction , emotional perception expression presumably could protect cognitive decline depression . Dance training may improve verbal fluency , word list delay recall word list recognition old adult metabolic syndrome , suggest dance may effective prevent cognitive decline . Aerobic dance also show enhance exercise endurance strength , balance , agility gait performance old adult . Our team previously design implemented balance dance group patient PD 8 week . Together training , balance ability walk speed increase effect last 12 month treatment completion . Given likely positive effect aerobic dance , appear good exercise candidate enhance cognitive , mood physical function patient cerebral SVD . Data Collection Assessment cognitive function The 30-minute protocol National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke - Canadian Stroke Network VCI protocol use . The 30-minute protocol provide comprehensive assessment cognitive function emphasis executive function , psychomotor speed memory , cognitive domain predominately impaired VCI . With support Health Health Service Research fund ( PI : Vincent CT MOK ; Reference Number 06070231 ) , investigator adapt validated 30-minute protocol group Chinese stroke patient control demonstrate good external validity ( area ROC=0.79 [ 95 % CI 0.69-0.89 ] , p &lt; 0.001 ) differentiate stroke patient non-stroke control concurrent validity functional measure . In addition 30-minute protocol , digit span test Wechsler Memory Scale administer involvement immediate attention work memory VCI . Measure depressive symptom The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) , self-reported questionnaire rate depressive symptom elderly person , use . It use local study SVD patient demonstrate excellent classification power &gt; 90 % detect depression local elderly population . Measures physical function The Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test ( Mini-BESTest ) use assess dynamic balance performance individual . The 14-item Mini-BESTest represent 4 dynamic balance domain : anticipatory postural adjustment , postural response , sensory orientation stability gait . Each item rat 0 2 , total score range 0-28 high score indicate good balance . The Timed-up-and-go test ( TUG ) use examine functional mobility subject . This test measure time participant take rise chair , walk 3 meter , turn around , walk back chair sit . The 6-minute walk test use determine walk capacity . This test measure distance ( metre ) participant walk 6 minute . Participants walk speed , stop rest allow necessary . Measure daily function The Lawton 's Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) use ass complex activity daily function impair early patient SVD . It take 10 minute administer contain 8 item include ability use telephone , shopping , food preparation , housekeeping , laundry , take transportation , handle medication finance . It use primary outcome instrument Pan-European Leukoaraiosis Disability Elderly Study SVD . Measure overall physical activity Physical activity perform outside training session record use long form International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) . The IPAQ widely use study physical activity across different age medical condition ( http : //www.ipaq.ki.se/publications.htm ) . The IPAQ record type , frequency duration physical activity across 4 activity domain include leisure time physical activity , domestic related physical activity , work-related transportation related physical activity . The IPAQ yield score walk , moderate-intensity vigorous-intensity activity activity domains . A total score calculate sum duration frequency type activity across domain . This score use account potential confounding effect physical activity perform outside training session group . It estimate take approximately 2 hour complete assessment TCD examination . To avoid rater bias , research assistant ( RA ) performs study assessment blind treatment allocation encourage discuss participant intervention . Clinical assessment perform trained RA supervision qualify clinical psychologist ( PI application ) . TCD Examination TCD examination perform baseline , week 12 , 24 36 . A 2-MHz pulsed Doppler hand-held probe use insonate middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) temporal window zygomatic arch depth 52-56mm , vertebral artery ( VA ) occipital window depth 64mm . The Pulsatility Index ( PI ) Breath Holding Index ( BHI ) calculate . The PI measure vascular resistance cerebral vessel . The mean PI middle MCA vertebral VA obtain . A previous study investigator show measure highly differentiate stroke patient without WML MRI ( AUC = 0.85 [ MCA ] 0.81 [ VA ] , sensitivity specificity 70 82 % ] ) . According standard protocol , simple breath hold procedure perform TCD session obtain BHI , serve marker CVR . A trained postgraduate research student supervision broad certify neurologist ( Co-A Vincent MOK ) perform TCD blind participant 's treatment allocation .</detailed_description>
