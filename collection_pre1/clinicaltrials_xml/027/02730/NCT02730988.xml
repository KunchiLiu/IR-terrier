	<brief_summary>Intentional weight loss obese , old adult remain controversial . Although caloric restriction , result significant weight fat mass loss , ameliorate many clinical consequence obesity , recommendation intentional weight loss age remain controversial . Reluctance stem , least part , loss lean bone mass know accompany overall weight loss potential exacerbation age-related risk disability fracture . Accordingly , current treatment guideline call fhttp : //google.wfu.edu/or weight-loss therapy minimizes muscle bone loss older person obese functional impairment medical complication benefit weight loss . Amount dietary protein consume caloric restriction may key determinant maintain fat-free mass weight loss . Adequate dietary protein essential skeletal muscle anabolism ; , epidemiological evidence old adult point salutary effect protein intake current RDA ( 0.8 g/kg/day ) body composition . Indeed , recent position statement PRO-TAGE study group advise consumption 1.0-1.2 g/kg/d old adult weight-stable condition aid maintenance lean body mass function . Practical achievement level protein intake often difficult obese , old adult undergo weight loss , yet may critical offset weight loss-associated lean mass loss . Preliminary data group show lean mass spar effect high protein consumption caloric restriction . In post-menopausal woman undergo 5-month intentional weight loss program , consumption high ( 1.2 g/kg/day ) versus low ( 0.6 g/kg/day ) protein diet associate 50 % attenuation ( 17 % vs. 37 % ) lean mass loss . While promise , result yet translate functional change tightly control trial weight loss obese , old adult . The primary goal study determine whether adherence high protein ( ≥1.0 g/kg/d ) weight loss program result improve physical function favorably affect body composition compare weight stability obese , old adult . This accomplished conduct 24-week trial 124 obese ( BMI 30-40 kg/m2 ) , old ( 65-79 year ) men woman , risk mobility disability , randomize either : ( 1 ) high protein intake ( ≥1.0 g/kg/d ; n=62 ) weight loss , ( 2 ) weight-stable control ( n=62 ) .</brief_summary>
