	<criteria>Informed consent : Subjects must give sign dated write informed consent participate prior commence study related activity . Age Range : 12 50 year age , inclusive , Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Diagnosis : A diagnosis asthma , define National Institutes Health least 12 week prior Visit 1 . Asthma Severity : Subjects must prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt; =70 percent predict normal value . Predicted value base upon Global Lung Function Initiative equation spirometry reference value . Evidence EIB : Subjects must answer `` Yes '' least 2 follow 3 question reflect previous 12 month : Are short breath exercise physical exertion ? Do wheeze exercise physical exertion ? Do cough exercise physical exertion ? Concurrent AntiAsthma Therapy : Subjects must take low moderate dose inhale steroid 12 week prior Visit 1 order participate change dose 4 week prior Visit 1 . Gender : Subjects may male eligible female . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile ) .Surgically sterile female define documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 1 year appropriate clinical profile , e.g. , age appropriate , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy . OR Child bear potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree acceptable contraceptive method approve local country , use consistently correctly ( i.e. , accordance approve product label instruction physician duration study screen followup contact ) . Albuterol/salbutamol Use : All subject must able replace current shortacting beta2agonist albuterol/salbutamol , use asneeded basis duration study . Each subject must judge capable withhold albuterol/salbutamol least 6 hour prior perform spirometric evaluation . Physical Capacity : Each subject must physically able perform exercise challenge treadmill bronchodilator withhold . Intermittent Asthma , Seasonal Asthma , ExerciseInduced Bronchoconstriction Only : Subjects intermittent seasonal asthma exerciseinduced asthma exclude participation study . History Lifethreatening Asthma : Defined protocol asthma episode require intubation and/or associate hypercapnia , respiratory arrest hypoxic seizure within last 10 year . Asthma Exacerbation : Any asthma exacerbation require oral corticosteroid within 12 week Visit 1 result overnight hospitalization require additional treatment asthma within 6 month prior Visit 1 . Symptomatic Allergic Rhinitis : Subjects symptomatic allergic rhinitis Visit 1 may treat four week intranasal corticosteroid follow repeat screen visit determine eligibility prior entry study . Subjects continue symptomatic four week treatment exclude . 12Lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : A subject eligible he/she abnormal , clinically significant ECG determine investigator Screening Visit . Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Respiratory Infection : Culturedocumented suspect bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus middle ear resolve within 4 week Visit 1 lead change asthma management , opinion investigator , expect affect subject 's asthma status subject 's ability participate study . Concurrent Respiratory Disease : A subject must current evidence : 1 . Atelectasis 2 . Bronchopulmonary dysplasia 3 . Chronic bronchitis 4 . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ( current past diagnosis include asthma/COPD overlap ) 5 . Pneumonia 6 . Pneumothorax 7 . Interstitial lung disease 8 . Or evidence concurrent respiratory disease asthma . Other Concurrent Diseases/Abnormalities : A subject must clinically significant , uncontrolled condition , disease state , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk study participation would confound interpretation efficacy result condition/disease exacerbate study . Investigational Medications : A subject must use investigational drug within 30 day prior Visit 1 within five halflives ( t1/2 ) prior investigational study , whichever long two period . Allergies : 1 ) Drug Allergy : Any adverse reaction include immediate delay hypersensitivity beta2agonist , sympathomimetic drug , intranasal , inhale , systemic corticosteroid therapy , excipients use FF/VI 100/25 FP 250 ( i.e. , drug , lactose magnesium stearate ) . 2 ) Milk Protein Allergy : History severe milk protein allergy . 3 ) Latex Allergy : History allergy sensitivity latex opinion investigator contraindicate subject 's participation study . Concomitant Medication : Administration prescription nonprescription medication would significantly affect course asthma , interact study drug . Immunosuppressive Medications : A subject must use require use immunosuppressive medication study . Compliance : A subject eligible he/she his/her parent legal guardian infirmity , disability , disease , geographical location seem likely ( opinion investigator ) impair compliance aspect study protocol . Tobacco/Marijuana Use : Current tobacco smoker smoke history &gt; =10 packyears ( 20 cigarettes/day 10 year ) . A subject may use inhale tobacco product inhale marijuana within past 3 month ( e.g . cigarette , cigar , electronic cigarette , pipe tobacco ) . Affiliation Investigator 's Site : A subject eligible study he/she immediate family member participate investigator , subinvestigator , studycoordinator employee participate investigator .</criteria>
