	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pioglitazone hydrochloride tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy work treat patient chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) come back period improvement ( relapse ) first TKI discontinuation . TKI may stop growth cancer cell block certain enzyme need cell growth . Although TKI therapy effective CML , residual cancer cell call leukemia stem cell able hide TKIs . Pioglitazone hydrochloride drug approve Food Drug Administration treat diabetes show laboratory study increase CML stem cell death give together TKI therapy . Giving pioglitazone hydrochloride TKI therapy may effective treat patient CML .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety combination pioglitazone hydrochloride ( PIO ) TKI CML subject experience loss major molecular response ( MMR ) follow first TKI discontinuation . II . To assess survival without loss MMR follow second TKI discontinuation subject achieve maintain &lt; molecular response ( MR ) ^4.5 combination PIO TKI administer least 6 month . OUTLINE : Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Patients also start continue TKI therapy pre-discontinuation dos . Courses repeat every 28 day 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every month 3 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
