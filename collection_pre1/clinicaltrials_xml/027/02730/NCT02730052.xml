	<brief_summary>The proportion hypertensive patient achieve adequate blood pressure control meeting guideline target remain low . Of patient blood pressure lower drug , 50 % reach control . Objectives : 1 . Test feasibility telemonitoring blood pressure uncontrolled hypertensive patient . 2 . Investigate whether telemonitoring enable self-measurement blood pressure lead faster blood pressure control self-measurement without telemonitoring . 3 . Secondary endpoint include adverse effect , assessment quality life , adherence , log technical problem , cost-effectiveness . Methods : Randomised parallel-group study consist 4 stage . - Screening check eligibility . - Randomisation 1:1 proportion control experimental arm : In control arm , doctor receive report self-measured blood pressure base diary card ; experimental group , doctor receive weekly report via telemonitoring . - Treatment period : Doctors adjust treatment accord present guideline Hypertension . Blood pressure control home blood pressure 135 mm Hg systolic 85 mm Hg diastolic . Once blood pressure control achieve treatment period end . - Late follow-up : Assessment blood pressure control home 3 month completion treatment period mean telemonitoring . Sample size : 120 patient per group . Patients : recruit clinic Uruguay Argentina . Main Inclusion Criteria : - Women men , age range 20 80 year . - Uncontrolled hypertension new diagnose hypertension self-measured blood pressure home 135 mm Hg systolic and/or 85 mm Hg diastolic ; - Patients willing accept adherence check follow-up sign inform write consent . Exclusion Criteria - Patients emotionally intellectually capable measure blood pressure home ; - A clinical social context , suboptimal self-measurement blood pressure ; - Pregnancy ; - Alcohol substance abuse psychiatric illness ; - Participation another study . Expected outcome : blood pressure control achieve faster telemonitoring group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telemonitoring Uncontrolled Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Research Questions Previous study demonstrate feasibility telemonitoring blood pressure . However , several issue remain unaddressed . - Feasibility telemonitoring within South American context never test . No attempt ever make South America ass adherence antihypertensive drug primary care . - Telemonitoring blood pressure never make routine clinical practice unless proven application technique result faster well blood pressure control compare usual care include self-measurement blood pressure home . - Secondary endpoint must also include adverse event , simple assessment quality life , adherence , log technical problem , cost-effectiveness . 2 . General Design ERNESTINA randomise parallel-group study , address feasibility potential benefit telemonitoring blood pressure home . Eligible patient recruit outpatient medical clinic . - Screening period follow stratification randomisation : Screening involves check inclusion exclusion criterion , rule secondary hypertension remediable specific treatment , obtain inform write consent outline Helsinki declaration . Eligible patient stratify centre randomise one-to-one proportion control intervention . Randomisation implement sequentially number sealed envelope , contain group assignment . These envelope available practice , contact Studies Coordinating Centre ( SCC ) necessary randomise patient . - Randomised period : Investigators optimise medical treatment rotate patient different class antihypertensive drug , combine drug class accord current guideline Argentinian European Societies Hypertension ( SAHA ESH ) , achieve maximal tolerate dose drug . In intervention group , investigator receive report telemonitoring data weekly interval ; control group doctor receive information self-measured blood pressure record home week precede office visit via diary card . Doctors free schedule contact patient office visit discretion visit least every 3 week . Once blood pressure control achieve , blood pressure measure device ( telemonitoring enable ) recuperate become available next patient . In control group , patient keep diary card week precede office visit . - Late follow-up : Three month achieve blood pressure control , patient telemonitored 1 week complete diary card , precede office visit . 3 . Primary Secondary Endpoints Primary endpoint The primary endpoint time blood pressure control two randomise group . Blood pressure control define self-measured blood pressure home 135 mm Hg systolic 85 mm Hg diastolic . Blood pressure control assume present aforementioned level attain week precede last office visit randomise treatment visit . Treatment resistance home blood pressure control 3 drug class give maximal dos , preferably include diuretic 6 month follow-up . These patient might refer exploration treatment adjustment hypertension centre . Secondary endpoint Secondary endpoint relate blood pressure control ( efficacy ) : - The proportion patient reach blood pressure control self-measurement home office measurement ; Blood pressure control office measurement seat blood pressure 140 mm Hg systolic 90 mm Hg ; - The proportion patient reach maintain blood pressure control self-measurement office measurement late follow-up visit ; - The intensity medical treatment ; - Adverse event , record self-administered questionnaire . - Assessment drug adherence ; - Assessment quality life ; - Analysis cost-effectiveness . Economic Analysis The cost-effectiveness analysis include direct indirect cost intervention . The cost balance use medical resource , include visit , medication , use medical resource . Moreover , incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICERs ) calculate divide net cost intervention total incremental health care cost intervention accord formula ICER = ( Ci - Cc ) / ( Ei - Ec ) , Ci Cc Ei Ec cost effectiveness associate intervention usual care , respectively . Sensitivity analyse examine influence uncertainty variable assumption . Model performance estimate confidence interval estimate probabilistic manner use Monte Carlo simulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Women men eligible . Women reproductive age apply effective contraception . 2 . Age range 20 year ( inclusive ) 80 year . 3 . At screening , patient hypertension , uncontrolled medical treatment . Uncontrolled hypertension office blood pressure 140 mm Hg systolic 90 mm Hg diastolic high AND selfmeasured blood pressure home 135 mm Hg systolic 85 mm Hg diastolic . Practitioners receive weekly report selfmeasured blood pressure home summarise result runin period . 4 . At screen visit , patient either untreated least 4 week take stable drug regimen least 4 week . Medical treatment consist major drug class . This include diuretic , betablockers , alfablockers , calciumchannel blocker ( CCBs ) , inhibitor renin system ( angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) , angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker ( ARBs ) , direct renin inhibitor aliskiren,18 aldosterone receptor antagonist ( ARAs ) , centrally act antihypertensive drug vasodilator ( hydralazine ) . In line current recommendation recent study , unless contraindicate tolerated , aldosterone antagonist , spironolactone 25 50 mg per day attempt least 4 week improve blood pressure control treatmentresistant patient . ( 1 ) The patient intellectually emotionally capable measure blood pressure home accept keep diary ( control group ) report send doctor ( intervention group ) . 5 . Patient provide write informed consent . 1 . The clinical context suboptimal telemonitoring blood pressure : Myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris , cerebrovascular accident within 6 month screening period ; Type 1 diabetes mellitus require multiple adjustment treatment maintain control diabetes mellitus recent hyperglycaemic hypoglycaemic coma ; Renal dysfunction define estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 30 mL/min/1.73m2 , use Modification Diet Renal Disease formula ; Secondary hypertension , treatment option antihypertensive drug treatment indicate ; Sleep apnea syndrome qualifies treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) ; Atrial fibrillation arrhythmia make oscillometric blood pressure measurement unreliable ; The patient wait list elective surgery cardiovascular intervention ; Patients alcohol substance abuse psychiatric illness . 2 . The patient serious medical condition , opinion investigator , may adversely interfere selfmeasurement blood pressure home . 3 . Patients participate trial investigational drug device .</criteria>
