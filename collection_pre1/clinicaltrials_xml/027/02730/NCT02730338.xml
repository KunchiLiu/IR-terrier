	<criteria>Patients must histologically document adenocarcinoma prostate progressive systemic ( clinically metastatic disease document bone , CT , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ) disease despite castrate level testosterone ( &lt; 50 ng/dL ) due orchiectomy luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist . Castrate level testosterone must maintain . Patients must either : Currently abiraterone and/or enzalutamide progress ; OR Preabiraterone preenzalutamide demonstrated evidence progressive disease . Defined least one following : Measurable Disease Progression : &gt; 20 % increase sum diameter measurable lesion time maximal regression appearance one new lesion . Bone Scan Progression : Appearance one new lesion bone scan attributable prostate cancer . Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) Progression : An elevated PSA ≥2 ng/ml rise serially least two occasion , least one week apart ( PSA1 &lt; PSA2 &lt; PSA3 ) . If 3rd PSA value le 2nd PSA value , additional test rise PSA required document progression . ( For purpose nomogram calculator , last PSA value record prior initiation intervention consider baseline PSA ) On Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) Gonadotropinreleasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist/antagonist prior bilateral orchiectomy . All patient require ADT throughout study ; ≥4 week since major surgery fully recover . Halabi Nomogram score &lt; 1951 Age ≥18 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Patients must able travel one studydesignated exercise facility three day per week four week cycle 0 , two day per week cycle 18 ( 32 week ) per week cycle 911 ( 12 week ) . In addition , patient must able attend exercise test visit outline Table 1.Required Initial Laboratory Values : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/uL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal PSA ≥ 2 ng/ml Serum testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL Medical clearance undergo symptomlimited cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) vigorous aerobic resistance exercise training . Appendix 8 : Patients must answer 'No ' question . If patient answer 'Yes ' Questions 811 , consider eligible upon physician clearance Successfully pas screen CPET achieving : Volitional exhaustion ( RPE ≥ 9 use 010 RPE scale ) 8 ( ) minute , absence cardiorespiratory abnormality . If cardiorespiratory abnormality identify , please refer patient manage physician assessment diagnosis . Note : To assist practitioner deliver valid CPET assessment , patient near exhaustion achieve respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) ≥1.1 . RER criteria test . This objective measure use assist practitioner patient management decisionmaking . Exercise Coordination Centre ( ECC ) review approval subject 's screen bone scan/ area bone metastasis . Subject willing able use technological aspect trial . The subject fluent language designate institution would enrol . Previous progression ( radiographic PSA progression ) treatment abiraterone , enzalutamide , combination . Previously identify small cell neuroendocrine tumours pure small cell carcinoma prostate , base prior biopsy prostate . Brain metastasis ( brain imaging require ) Any prior chemotherapy castrationresistant disease allow . Previous and/or concurrent treatment anticancer treatment permit . Patients allow treated chemotherapy duration trial . Patients receive chemotherapy part initial androgen deprivation therapy metastatic castration sensitive disease eligible . Currently receive experimental treatment nonapproved drug time enrolment . Patients must undergo 28day washout last dose screen CPET . Poorly control hypertension . During screen ≥2/3 reading must &lt; 160/90 , regardless whether regimen antihypertensive therapy . Current congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class II , III IV ) Recent serious cardiovascular event ( within 12 month ) include , limited , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Medical condition uncontrolled infection cardiac disease , opinion physician , would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient ( see Section 4.44.10 ) . Patients currently active second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider currently active malignancy complete necessary therapy consider physician &lt; 30 % risk relapse time assessment . Psychiatric illness , would prevent patient give informed consent adhere study protocol . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Known spinal cord compromise instrumentation due metastatic disease . Radiation therapy metastatic disease allow . Peripheral neuropathy ≥grade 3 . Men participate vigorous aerobic exercise 60 minute per week resistance exercise two day per week Experiences shortness breath , chest discomfort , palpitation perform activity daily live Has difficulty climb flight stair walk eight block due physical impairment Ongoing restriction physical activity physician documentation Has chest pain bring physical activity Has develop chest pain past month Moderatetosevere bone pain ( i.e. , National Cancer Institute 's Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events grade 23 bone pain ) .
