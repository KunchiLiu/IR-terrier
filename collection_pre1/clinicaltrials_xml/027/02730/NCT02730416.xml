	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Nintedanib / Placebo Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised phase 2 study evaluate combination chemotherapy nintedanib patient primary advanced stage ( 3C2 &amp; 4 ) , first relapse endometrial cancer . Patients stratify accord : 1 . Stage disease ( stage 3C2 vs. stage 4 vs. recurrent disease ) 2 . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes/no ) 3 . Disease status ( Measurable disease vs. non-measurable /RECIST 1.1 ) Patients randomize one two treatment arm 1:1 randomization : - Arm A : Paclitaxel Carboplatin ( 6 course ) Nintedanib ( PD ) . ( Experimental arm ) - Arm B : Paclitaxel Carboplatin ( 6 course ) Placebo ( PD ) ( Control Arm ) Primary endpoint PFS . 148 patient enrol .</detailed_description>

Sarcomas , small cell carcinoma neuroendocrine differentiation nonepithelial cancer . 2 . Concurrent cancer therapy 3 . Previous Chemotherapy stage 4 disease relapse disease . 4 . Previous treatment antiangiogenic/anti VEGF therapy include nintedanib . 5 . Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial . 6 . Treatment within 28 day prior randomisation investigational drug , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy biological therapy . Palliative radiotherapy may permit symptomatic control pain bone metastasis extremity , provide radiotherapy involve target lesion , reason radiotherapy reflect progressive disease . 7 . Major injury surgery within past 21 day prior start study treatment incomplete wound heal and/or plan surgery ontreatment study period . 8 . Relapse within six month adjuvant chemotherapy ( treatmentfree interval &lt; 182 day ) . 9 . Previous malignant disease , except patient malignant disease , patient diseasefree least three year . Concurrent malignant disease except curatively treat carcinoma situ cervix basal cell carcinoma skin . 10 . Active infection serious underlie medical condition , might prevent patient receive treatment follow . 11 . Evidence significant medical illness , abnormal laboratory find psychiatric illness/social situation would , Investigator 's judgement , make patient inappropriate study . 12 . Known contraindication VEGF direct therapy Target Disease Exceptions 13 . Known uncontrolled hypersensitivity investigational drug . 14 . History major thromboembolic event define : Uncontrolled pulmonary embolism ( PE ) Deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) Other related condition , though patient stable therapeutic anticoagulation three month prior randomization eligible study . 15 .
