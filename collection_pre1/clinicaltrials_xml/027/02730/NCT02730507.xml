	<brief_summary>Lumbar degenerative disease ( LDD ) increasingly common condition affect million patient worldwide . LDD impact function , also become markedly disable cause severe chronic pain . Recent study support idea analysis sagittal balance crucial keypoint optimize management lumbar degenerative disease , especially spinal instrumentation intend . The first treatment pathology medical treatment ( medication , physical therapy exercise ) . Surgical treatment frequently necessary symptom worsen generally posterior spinal fusion instrumentation ( screw , hook rod ) bone graft . Basic principle surgery realign spine along rod . Despite documented technique surgical planning , appear significant number patient ultimately under-corrected surgery Realignment failure associate poor functional outcome also major complication , pseudoarthrosis rod breakage , often result additional surgical procedure . From pragmatic point view , two main reason realignment failure : poor surgical planning poor execution . One assumption perioperative manual bending rod may always allow surgeon restore sagittal parameter intend . A new concept patient-specific rod ( PSR ) propose French manufacturer order enable optimal correction surgical stabilization spine . PSR design fit patient 's unique sagittal spine profile surgeon ' surgical planning . However , relevant clinical data currently available support expect medical benefit new technology . The objective study therefore carry study hypothesizing use PSR could improve percentage patient whose sagittal profile optimally correct spinal surgery , well patient 's quality life .</brief_summary>
