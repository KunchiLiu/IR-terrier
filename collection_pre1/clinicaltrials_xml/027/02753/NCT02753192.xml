	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) affect 1 % 2 % world 's population age 60 old ; Europe prevalence around 150 PD patient per 100,000 individual . PD classically characterize symptomatic triad include rest tremor , akinesia hypertonia although motor expression symptom involve mainly limb , muscle implicate speech production also subject specific dysfunction . Motor speech disorder , so-called dysarthria , thus develop PD patient . The main objective project evaluate physiological parameter ( acoustic ) , perceptual marker ( intelligibility ) psychosocial impact dysarthric speech PD , context language ( French vs. Portuguese ) modulation . Acoustic parameter expect physiologically-based , link motoric aspect dysarthric speech . The degree impairment parameter associate pathology present universally patient , even speak different language ; also case prosodic marker , whereas impairment speech intelligibility may participate psychosocial impact communication alteration . PD patient enrol study Aix-en-Provence ( N = 60 ) Lisbon ( N = 60 ) . Their global motor disability assess dedicated clinical rating scale , without ( ) ( ) pharmacological treatment . Two group 60 healthy age-matched volunteer provide normal reference between-group comparison . Along medication clinical examination , several speech task record . Moreover , speech organ function also assess examination . The psychosocial impact dysarthria evaluate via self-questionnaires ; analyse posteriori , well speech intelligibility evaluation , strengthen overall speech assessment . This global investigation represent unique opportunity provide precise reliable description PD patient ' speech impact intelligibility quality life . Challenging interdisciplinary aspect combine project , original cross-linguistic approach involve international collaboration definitely new field motor speech disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - Individuals Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) deal several aspect contribute voice speech decline thus , alteration communication ability course disease : ( ) The orofacial motor dysfunction , so-called dysarthria , depend neurodegenerative process ; ( ii ) The effect medical treatment , vary accord disease stage ; ( iii ) The particular speech modification language-specific , i.e . dependent language speak patient . The main objective FralusoPark project evaluate change dysarthric speech PD result medical treatment disease duration use acoustic parameter ( voice prosody ) , perceptual marker ( intelligibility ) , patient-based outcome ( psychosocial impact quality life ) two different language ( French vs. European Portuguese ) . Methods - Individuals PD enrol study Aix-en-Provence , France ( N = 60 ) Lisbon , Portugal ( N = 60 ) . Their global motor disability orofacial motor function assess specific clinical rating scale , without ( OFF ) ( ON ) medical treatment . Two group 60 healthy age-matched volunteer provide reference between-group comparison . Along clinical examination , several speech task record obtain acoustic perceptual measure . Self-evaluation questionnaire use assess psychosocial impact dysarthria quality life . Discussion - Our three priori hypothesis follow : ( ) Global acoustic feature alter similarly French Portuguese individual PD ; ( ii ) Language-specific prosodic pattern might alter differently accord language spoken patient ; ( iii ) The impact speech disorder intelligibility quality life depend cultural linguistic environment . The study combine interdisciplinary cross-linguistic approach study motor speech disorder allow well understanding progression speech symptom PD response medical treatment . It provide recommendation assess speech voice disorder individual PD order monitor symptom progression management .</detailed_description>
