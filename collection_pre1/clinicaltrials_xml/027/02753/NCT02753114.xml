	<brief_summary>Acute painful condition make-up large proportion pre-hospital transport British Columbia ( BC ) yet Basic Life Support ( BLS ) paramedic limit option provide analgesia therefore adequate timely pain relief often significantly delay . Inhaled nitrous oxide commonly use pre-hospital analgesic consider `` usual care '' pre-hospital provider BC , utility severe pain uncertain . Moreover , nitrous oxide limited effectiveness short duration action , nausea , vomit , necessity patient cooperation . IN Ketamine show provide rapid , easily-administered , well-tolerated analgesia many setting . The investigator believe addition IN ketamine usual care nitrous oxide inhalation adult experience moderate severe intensity acute pain pre-hospital setting result improve pain severity , improve patient-reported comfort , improve patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prehospital Analgesia With Intra-Nasal Ketamine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study see whether intra-nasal ( IN ) Ketamine ( 50 mg / ml ) solution ( Sandoz ; Drug Identification Number ( DIN ) 02246796 ) administer via mucosal atomization device ( LMA MAD300 Nasal TM ; Wolfe Tory Medical Inc. , San Diego , CA ) , addition usual care nitrous oxide inhalation , pre-hospital patient transport British Columbia Emergency Health Services ( BC EHS ) Basic Life Support ( BLS ) paramedic moderate severe pain ( pain &gt; 5/10 validated numerical rating scale NRS ) improve pain relative usual care plus placebo . Hypothesis : It hypothesize addition IN ketamine usual care nitrous oxide inhalation adult experience moderate severe intensity acute pain pre-hospital setting result great proportion patient experience 2-point reduction verbal numerical rating scale ( VNRS ) pain score within 30 minute , well improve patient-reported comfort , reduce nitrous oxide requirement , improve patient provider satisfaction compare usual care alone . Background : Acute painful condition make-up large proportion pre-hospital transport yet BLS paramedic limit option provide analgesia , therefore , adequate timely pain relief often significantly delay . Inhaled nitrous oxide commonly use pre-hospital analgesic consider `` usual care '' BLS pre-hospital provider . Nitrous oxide show effective analgesia patient moderate pain utility severe pain uncertain . No alternative treatment exist BLS provider pre-hospital setting . Intra-nasal ketamine safe , well-tolerated mean provide analgesia proven work pre-hospital setting without need cardio-respiratory monitoring . Objectives : The objective study collect pilot data compare addition intranasal Ketamine intranasal placebo term efficacy effectiveness patient receive usual care nitrous oxide moderate severe pain . Secondary objective assess subjective improvement pain , effect nitrous oxide requirement , incidence adverse effect , patient provider satisfaction , study recruitment potential . These data inform future large-scale trial design use validate propose 7-point patient-reported pain improvement scale . Research Methods : This randomized double-blind pilot trial conduct pre-hospital set low mainland . The pilot series constitute 40 patient ( 20 per group ) . The sample size large randomize control trial calculate use effect size variance accrue data . Statistical Analysis : A statistician contract independently oversee analysis study result . The intention-to-treat principal use analyze data . Data analyze use descriptive statistic . Categorical data present frequency percentage frequency occurrence . Continuous data present median range interquartile range ( IQRs ) . Adverse effect describe frequency occurrence 95 % confidence interval . A p-value 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
