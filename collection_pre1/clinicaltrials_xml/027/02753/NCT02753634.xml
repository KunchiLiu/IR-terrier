	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) grow burden age society . There proven treatment hence disability contribute poor quality life direct/indirect cost society . OA symptoms include increase pain reduced mobility . Strength train aerobic exercise show improve symptom OA ; however , impact target mobility balance training patient osteoarthritis unclear . The investigator propose novel , low-impact exercise modality improve balance gait . The result research project improve patient option improve knowledge OA management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients OA increase fall risk , lead reduce mobility curtailment daily activity . Patients OA also show varied altered mobility sit-to-stand test , suggest poor low limb strength flexibility need address targeted intervention population . Altered mobility also associate pain patient OA . The cause decrease mobility increase pain often result body weight . In 5-year follow-up study , class knee OA identify associate good , moderate poor outcome ; characteristic poor outcome class include high BMI , bad pain , &gt; 2 co-morbidities avoidance activity . Avoidance activity particularly important outcome since could lead downward spiral decrease physical functioning , fall avoidance activity . Multiple study show increase weight normal overweight obese decrease mobility increase pain individual OA . This potential target non-pharmacological therapy . For example , Messier et al. , show diet exercise intervention design promote weight loss overweight individual knee OA , improve knee compressive force function , reduce inflammatory marker IL-6 , decrease pain improved physical health-related quality life 18-month period . This study demonstrate important effect weight loss exercise knee OA overall health . In recent review , evidence overwhelm regard use exercise treatment knee OA . Specifically , literature demonstrate strength training aerobic exercise improve outcome , pain reduction increase function , patient OA . Lifestyle intervention utilized OA population help reduce pain , improve mobility reduce fall risk . Square-Stepping Exercise ( SSE ) develop low-tech , low-intensity , novel form exercise develop Japan . SSE originally design reduce fall risk old adult . Participants watch , recognize , memorize follow increasingly difficult step pattern , instructor demonstrate 4 10 square-patterned mat . In old adult population , Shigematsu colleague find SSE improve overall fitness lower extremity functioning , well reduce fall risk , compare walk program strength balance training . In combination Shigematsu 's research Japan healthy old adult , investigator aim provide significant evidence base SSE internationally within varied population , include old adult osteoarthritis . In collaboration Dr. Shigematsu , investigator execute SSE study Canadian Centre Activity Aging London , ON recently Woodstock , ON . Preliminary evidence study Canadian Centre Activity Aging show 3-month training period , participant Exercise-Intervention ( E-I ) group ( involve mind-motor exercise ) improve total balance score , compare Exercise-Control ( E-C ) group . SSE test OA population . This pilot study add literature determine whether reduces pain improves mobility additional non-pharmacological treatment population .</detailed_description>
