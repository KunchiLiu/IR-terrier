	<detailed_description>Study objectives establish label indication pleasure patient preference fit condom , establish label indication anal sex fit , thin , standard condom , establish label indication decrease clinical failure fit condom anal sex . The study enroll 252 MSM 252 men sex woman ( MSW ) double-blind , three-way randomize crossover trial condition fit , thin , standard condom . For MSM enrol trial ass outcome base anal sex , MSW ass outcome base vaginal sex . The study provide fit condom 56 size base combination length ( approximately 10 mm increment ) circumference ( approximately 2 mm increment ) , user-determined size base paper template measurement instrument . For purpose study , `` standard '' condom define dimension commonly source United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) United States Agency International Development ( USAID ) , procure majority world 's condom . These dimension 185mm ± 10mm length , 53mm ± 2mm width , 70 micron ± 10 micron thick . `` Thin '' condom study identical width length `` standard '' , 50 micron ± 5 micron thick . Fitted condom produce range size thickness 70 micron ± 10 micron , participant 's fitted size determine use fit system consist paper template graduate non-sequential numbering lettering . Condoms manufacture use latex formulation silicone lubricant ( approximately 400mg per condom ) , similar parallel wall design . Every participant trial receive set five fitted condom ( fitted condition ) , set five thin condom ( thin condition ) , set five standard condom ( standard condition ) series study visit . Event-level data base home coital log collect regard pleasure total clinical failure , data regard overall condom preference collect final study visit . Participants randomly assign sequence crossover intervention condition ( fit , thin , standard ) occur . Each participant attend least four , seven , biweekly study visit . Participants give four week use study condom set ; 4 week set condom , participant automatically cross next study condition . If condom use within first two week , participant crossover next randomized condition . Participants blind , condom produce plain foils two-digit identifying code , role-based blinding conduct study staff statistician PI blind . Participants trained appropriate condom use , fit condom sizing , study instruction use study lubricant , daily coital log completion . Participants complete mobile-optimized , web-based home coital log soon possible follow vaginal anal sex act . To assist participant timely completion , daily check-in Short Message Service ( SMS ) ( via text message ) reminder initiate sexual event recently report . The coital log include outcome measure pleasure condom failure . The final visit survey measure overall condom preference .</detailed_description>
