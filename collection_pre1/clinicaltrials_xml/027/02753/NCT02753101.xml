	<brief_summary>Chronic pain result injure inflamed nerve , happen people suffer sciatica CRPS . These nerve injury region nerve irritation often cause pain condition , current diagnostic tool proven quite limited pinpoint area . Several study implicate involvement sigma-1 receptor generation perpetuation chronic pain condition , others investigate anti sigma-1 receptor drug treatment chronic pain . Using [ 18F ] FTC-146 , sigma-1 receptor ( S1R ) detector experimental radiotracer , positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ( PET/MRI ) , hope learn best approach identify site nerve injury/inflammation ( tissue injury/inflammation ) relate painful condition , , therefore , help identify source pain generation . We characterize disease patient suffer complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) chronic sciatica , overarch goal optimize develop improved pain treatment regimen . The broad objective study : - To determine dosimetry [ 18F ] FTC-146 - To evaluate safety [ 18F ] FTC-146 single administration - To evaluate pharmacokinetics ability radiotracer reflect S1R expression healthy subject specific patient subpopulation . The study design induce physiological/pharmacological effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18FFTC-146 PET/MRI Healthy Volunteers CRPS Sciatica</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants either pain free recruit base establish criterion sciatica CRPS . Patients outside age range ( &lt; 18 year ) , contraindication MRI PET scan exclude . A signed consent obtain willing participant . For PET/MRI scan , participant inject 10 mCi ± 1 mCi [ 18F ] FTC-146 via antecubital vein bolus injection . For evaluation plasmatic kinetics , blood sample take subset recruited subject 2 hour injection radiotracer estimate plasma activity use gamma counter . After injection , PET MRI scan acquire simultaneously use hybrid PET/MRI scanner . Throughout scan , participant monitor blood pressure , temperature , heart rate pulse oximetry . Participants ask void bladder frequently reduce radiation exposure . Following scan , participant contact check adverse drug event , event record case report . For subset patient , small blood sample ( 2 teaspoon ) blood chemistry hematology collect day scan follow-up visit 24 hour 1 week injection . The biodistribution radiotracer analyze use region interest ( ROI ) mark anatomical structure magnetic resonance image quantify signal PET image within ROIs . Pharmacokinetic information derive use mathematical modeling .</detailed_description>

Sudomotor/Edema : Reports edema and/or sweating change and/or sweat asymmetry 4 . Motor/Trophic : Reports decrease range motion and/or motor dysfunction ( weakness , tremor , dystonia ) and/or trophic change ( hair , nail , skin ) Must display least one sign time evaluation In two follow category : 1 . Sensory : Evidence hyperalgesia ( pinprick ) and/or allodynia ( light touch and/or temperature sensation and/or deep somatic pressure and/or joint movement ) 2 . Vasomotor : Evidence temperature asymmetry ( &gt; 1°C ) and/or skin color change and/or asymmetry 3 . Sudomotor/Edema : Evidence edema and/or sweat change and/or sweat asymmetry 4 . Motor/Trophic : Evidence decrease range motion and/or motor dysfunction ( weakness , tremor , dystonia ) and/or trophic change ( hair , nail , skin ) There diagnosis well explain sign symptom For research purpose , diagnostic decision rule least one symptom four symptom category least one sign ( observed evaluation ) two sign category .
