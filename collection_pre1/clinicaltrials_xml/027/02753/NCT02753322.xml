	<brief_summary>Stroke one common chronic disabling condition Hong Kong . People stroke may suffer certain degree physical impairment disability . Resuming safe ambulation community appear big challenge always involve simultaneous performance two task ( dual task ) walk talk someone , walk recall shop list etc . Numerous study demonstrate interference dual task ( dual task interference ) may significantly impact recovery functional walking . To date , relevance dual task walk daily community widely document ability manage dual task therefore particularly important . Evidences support dual task training show promising effect balance walk performance amongst people neurological disorder , chronic stroke . In light , introduction dual task base balance walk train physiotherapy program stroke patient may enhance balance walk performance hence promote successful community ambulation . Yet , limited evidence effect sub-acute stroke . Objective : To examine effectiveness dual-task base balance walk train program performance dual task interference balance walk ability , balance self-efficacy incidence fall people sub-acute stroke</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training Dual-task Balance Walking People With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An assessor-blind , randomize control trial conduct . Eighty-four people sub-acute stroke fulfill eligibility criterion recruit medical ward Queen Elizabeth Hospital ( QEH ) Physiotherapy Department QEH . Subjects randomly allocate either dual-task training ( DT ) group ( n=28 ) single-task training ( ST ) group ( n=28 ) Control ( C ) group ( n=28 ) 1:1:1 randomization sequence baseline evaluation . All subject receive usual physiotherapy training . Subjects DT group undergo 30 minute dual task training simultaneously perform balance walking exercise attention demand task , 30 minute stretch exercise whereas ST group undergo single task train 30 minute balance walk exercise 30 minute attention demand task perform separately . Subjects control group receive stretch strengthen exercise . The training program last 8 week frequency 2 session week duration 60 minute per session . The degree dual-task interference , balance walk performance dual task condition evaluate three time point : ( 1 ) Baseline ( within one week intervention ( 2 ) within one week completion training ( 3 ) 8 week completion training blind assessor . Also , subject monthly telephone follow fall incidence 6 month completion program .</detailed_description>
