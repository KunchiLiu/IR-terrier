	<brief_title>Preventing Osteoporosis Using Denosumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The long term goal improve health , well-being quality life frail long-term care ( LTC ) elderly population reduce fracture . The short term goal demonstrate efficacy non-bisphosphonate denosumab improve bone mineral density ( BMD ) , necessary ( sufficient ) pre-condition large fracture reduction trial . The investigator propose conduct 2-year , randomize , double-blind , calcium-vitamin D control trial test efficacy predictability antiresorptive RANK ligand inhibitor , denosumab ( 60 mg ) , among cohort 212 institutionalized , under-served , frail men woman ≥65 year old LTC . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To evaluate efficacy denosumab improving/maintaining bone mineral density . The investigator measure conventional hip spine bone mineral density ( BMD ) . Primary Hypothesis : After 2 year , woman men denosumab great hip spine BMD increase . Aim 2 : To examine improvement trabecular microstructure collect preliminary exploratory evidence fracture subsequent fracture reduction trial . The investigator measure vertebral trabecular bone score ( TBS ) , 3-D microarchitectural image parameter spine independent BMD . Hypothesis 2 : After 2 year , participant denosumab great increase TBS measure . Aim 3 : To determine characteristic associated responder non-responders . The investigator use multiple regression analysis data mining technique identify baseline characteristic responder non-responders . Hypothesis 3.1 : Poor baseline functional/cognitive status/immobility associate poor bone health outcome . Hypothesis 3.2 : Greater early change bone turnover marker associate great skeletal improvement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ambulatory male female resident osteoporosis low bone mass ( risk fracture ) age 65 older consider : Reside longterm care institution ( nursing home assist living facility ) ; HaveOsteoporosis : ( 1 ) bone density [ spine , hip forearm Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) Tscore ≤ 2.5 ] ; ( 2 ) A previous adult fragility fracture spine hip ; ( 3 ) Would treat base FRAX® National Osteoporosis Foundation ( NOF ) treatment threshold 10 year risk ≥ 20 % major fracture ≥ 3 % hip fracture sue femoral neck BMD . Institutionalized resident subacute illness expect survive discharge &lt; 2 year . Nonambulatory resident ( stand pivot assistance order transfer DXA table ) . Those currently therapy ( include bisphosphonate , denosumab , teriparatide ) bisphosphonate &gt; 1year previous 2 year bisphosphonates long acting . Those history hypocalcemia contraindication treatment . We screen condition detailed history , chart review , baseline laboratory analysis . Those vitamin D level &lt; 25ng/mL treated vitamin D 50,000 IU/wk 8 week ; enrol followup vitamin D level 25 ng/mL ( 2 round vitamin D repletion vitamin D level least 25 ng/mL , eligible randomize study ) . Those dialysis stage 5 chronic kidney disease ( eGFR &lt; 15ml/min ) exclude screening . Those require tooth extraction oral surgery enrol cleared dentist . Patients allow continue glucocorticoid anticonvulsant use common population . Those glucocorticoid anticonvulsant allow continue study use common population . Those hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , raloxifene , prescribe protective hip pad Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) allow participate continue therapy . We suggest participant stop longterm calcitonin discontinue Europe due cancer concern .</criteria>
