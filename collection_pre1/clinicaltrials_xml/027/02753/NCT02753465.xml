	<detailed_description>During surgery rectal cancer , considerable controversy regard optimal level ligation inferior mesenteric artery.There differentiation high versus low ligation inferior mesenteric artery relate whether ligation ( high ligation ) ( low ligation ) leave colic artery . Several study demonstrate benefit high ligation inferior mesenteric artery rectal cancer order achieve block dissection lymph node metastasis along root inferior mesenteric artery . Excision apical lymph node root inferior mesenteric artery think necessary radical resection rectal cancer apical lymph node resection contributes improve lymph node retrieval rate accuracy tumour staging . In contrast , study show significant decrease blood flow inferior mesenteric artery clamping may increase risk anastomotic ischemia . Patients high ligation inferior mesenteric artery 3.8 time high chance leak low ligation . Several study confirm long-term outcome significantly different high ligation inferior mesenteric artery low ligation . So , modified procedure suggest dissect fatty tissue node angle inferior mesenteric artery leave colic artery artery ligate left colic artery , represent compromise high low ligation . Recently , several study describe laparoscopic lymph node dissection around inferior mesenteric artery preservation leave colic artery rectosigmoid colon cancer . However , report describe clinical outcome associate management strategy . Furthermore , long-term outcome laparoscopic lymphadenectomy around inferior mesenteric artery rectal cancer seldom report . In present clinical trial , investigator perform laparoscopic surgery management strategy rectal cancer . Thus , goal study investigate short-term oncologic long-term outcome associate laparoscopic lymph node dissection around inferior mesenteric artery preservation leave colic artery rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
