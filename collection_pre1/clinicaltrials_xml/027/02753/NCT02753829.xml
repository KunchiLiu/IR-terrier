	<brief_summary>The sample randomize controlled trial obtain Cardiovascular Prevention Rehabilitation Unit , Hospital Centre Porto , Santo Antonio General Hospital . The target population individual complete train phase cardiovascular rehabilitation program , volunteer reference responsible service . This study main objective analyze influence specific exercise program , maintenance phase cardiovascular rehabilitation , home care context , period 6 month , use virtual format ( computer Kinect ) conventional format ( paper manual ) subject coronary artery disease . It intend analyze immediate effect exercise program body composition food consumption pattern , functional muscle strength lower limb , level physical activity : total volume activity well profile intensity , kyphotic index , balance , cognitive executive function , well quality life . The aim also examine effect , approximately 3 month end exercise program , lipid profile , level physical activity : total volume activity well profile intensity cardiovascular fitness : maximum double product ; metabolic equivalent ; proof recovery time . The individual distribute random , every 3 individual , use capability Microsoft Excel 2010 RANDBETWEEN command , three group : experimental group 1- cardiovascular rehabilitation program , home care context , use computer Kinect , virtual format , experimental group 2- cardiovascular rehabilitation program , home care context , use paper-based manual , conventional format , control group-only subject education cardiovascular risk factor . The program define 3 training session per week . The rehabilitation program orient guideline exercise prescription . Participants perform program specific exercise independently individually , remote supervision , use communication ( phone , email , etc . ) routine schedule individual meeting .</brief_summary>
