	<criteria>1 . Written , sign consent trial participation must obtain patient appropriately accordance applicable ICH guideline local regulatory requirement prior performance study specific procedure . 2 . Must histologically confirm advanced CRC metastatic . 3 . Must fail treatment one regimen contain fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin bevacizumab metastatic disease . All patient must receive minimum 6 week firstline regimen include bevacizumab , oxaliplatin fluoropyrimidine cycle . Treatment failure define radiologic progression &lt; 6 month last dose firstline therapy . 4 . FOLFIRI therapy appropriate patient recommend Investigator . 5 . Imaging investigation include CT/MRI chest/abdomen/pelvis scan necessary document site disease perform within 21 day prior randomization . Patients either measurable disease nonmeasurable evaluable disease eligible . 6 . Must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 . 7 . Must ≥ 18 year age . 8 . For male female patient child produce potential : Must agree use contraception take measure avoid pregnancy study 180 day female male patient , final FOLFIRI dose . Patients receive single agent napabucasin without FOLFIRI must agree use contraception take measure avoid pregnancy study 30 day female patient 90 day male patient , final napabucasin dose . 9 . Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 5 day prior randomization . The minimum sensitivity pregnancy test must 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG . 10 . Must alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) [ ≤ 5 × ULN presence liver metastases ] within 14 day prior randomization . 11 . Must hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL within 14 day prior randomization . Must require transfusion red blood cell within 1 week baseline Hgb assessment . 12 . Must total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN [ ≤ 2.0 x ULN presence liver metastases ] within 14 day prior randomization . 13 . Must creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ( calculate CockcroftGault equation ) within 14 day prior randomization . 14 . Must absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L within 14 day prior randomization . 15 . Must platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L within 14 day prior randomization . Must require transfusion platelet within 1 week baseline platelet assessment . 16 . Other baseline laboratory evaluation , list Section 6.0 , must do within 14 day prior randomization . 17 . Patient must consent provision , Investigator ( ) must confirm access agree submit representative formalin fix paraffin block tumor tissue order specific correlative marker assay may conduct . Submission tissue occur prior randomization . Where local center regulation prohibit submission block tumor tissue , two 2 mm core tumor block 1030 unstained slide whole section representative tumor tissue prefer . Where two 2 mm core tumor block unavailable , 1030 unstained slide whole section representative tumor tissue alone acceptable . Where previously resect biopsied tumor tissue exist available , approval Sponsor/designated CRO , patient may still consider eligible study . 18 . Patient must consent provision sample blood order specific correlative marker assay may conduct . 19 . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must receive protocol treatment follow participate center . This imply must reasonable geographical limit place patient consider trial . Investigators must ensure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , response assessment , adverse event , followup . 20 . Protocol treatment begin within 2 calendar day patient randomization . 21 . The patient receive therapy concurrent clinical study patient agree participate interventional clinical study participation trial study treatment . Patients participate survey observational study eligible participate study . 1 . Anticancer chemotherapy biologic therapy administer prior first plan dose study medication ( napabucasin FOLFIRI ) within period time equivalent usual cycle length regimen . An exception make oral fluoropyrimidines ( e.g . capecitabine , S1 ) , minimum 10 day since last dose must observe prior first plan dose study medication . Standard dose bevacizumab ( 5 mg/kg ) may administer prior FOLFIRI infusion , per Investigator decision , long permanent decision include exclude bevacizumab make prior patient randomization . Radiotherapy , immunotherapy ( include immunotherapy administer nonmalignant disease neoplastic treatment purpose ) , investigational agent within four week first plan dose napabucasin , exception single dose radiation 8 Gy ( equal 800 RAD ) palliative intent pain control 14 day randomization . 2 . More one prior chemotherapy regimen administer metastatic setting . 3 . Major surgery within 4 week prior randomization . 4 . Patients know brain leptomeningeal metastasis exclude , even treat . 5 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Women breastfeed take study treatment 4 week last dose napabucasin undergo treatment FOLFIRI 180 day last dose FOLFIRI . 6 . Gastrointestinal disorder ( ) , opinion Qualified/Principal Investigator , would significantly impede absorption oral agent ( e.g . active Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , extensive gastric small intestine resection ) . 7 . Unable unwilling swallow napabucasin capsule daily . 8 . Prior treatment napabucasin . 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , clinically significant nonhealing heal wound , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , significant pulmonary disease ( shortness breath rest mild exertion ) , uncontrolled infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . Known hypersensitivity 5fluorouracil/leucovorin 11 . Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency 12 . Known hypersensitivity irinotecan 13 . Abnormal glucuronidation bilirubin , know Gilbert 's syndrome 14 . Patients QTc interval &gt; 470 millisecond 15 . For patient treated regimen contain bevacizumab : History cardiac disease : congestive heart failure ( CHF ) &gt; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II ; active coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry ; unevaluated new onset angina within 3 month unstable angina ( angina symptom rest ) cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy ( beta blocker digoxin permit ) . Current uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure [ BP ] &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management ) well prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy .
