	<brief_summary>Hypothermia may reduce infarct size patient acute myocardial infarction provide reperfusion . Human study use systemic cool method fail show reduction infarction size . The use selective intracoronary hypothermia may overcome problem systemic cooling . The hypothesis study patient acute myocardial infarction , induction intracoronary hypothermia safe feasible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility Intracoronary Hypothermia Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In acute myocardial infarction , infarct size directly relate short long-term mortality development chronic heart failure.Therefore , limit infarct size great worth . Therapies reduce ischemic injury , primarily primary percutaneous coronary intervention seem exhaust . Consequently , still remain need effort develop therapy target reperfusion injury obtain additional reduction infarct size . Therapeutic hypothermia ( 32 - 35°C ) attenuate reperfusion injury therefore reduces infarct size variety animal model acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , provide reperfusion . In human study reduction confirm far , probably due fact systemic cooling slow reducing temperature therefore target temperature reach time substantial number patient reach . Furthermore , systemic cool side effect severe shiver , volume overload enhance adrenergic state . However , subgroup patient randomize clinical trial anterior myocardial infarction reach target temperature reperfusion show reduction infarct size . To make therapeutic hypothermia valuable treatment AMI , method induce hypothermia therefore modify . This method clinical feasible quick enough provide myocardial hypothermia reperfusion , without prolong symptom-to-balloon time without adverse effect systemic cooling . In study investigator evaluate safety feasibility intracoronary hypothermia 10 patient acute myocardial infarction . In study patient , routine primary percutaneous intervention commence . Before reperfusion , saline room temperature infuse though occlusion infarct relate artery use wire balloon catheter 10 minute . The balloon inflate prevent reperfusion phase . After 10 minute balloon deflate allow reperfusion infusion saline 4°C continue 10 minute . After , coronary stent place . Primary end point safety feasibility method .</detailed_description>
