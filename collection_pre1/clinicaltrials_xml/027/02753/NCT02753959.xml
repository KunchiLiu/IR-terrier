	<brief_summary>Patients NMD suffer range respiratory problem due respiratory muscle weakness . Cough muscle weakness worsen secretion clearance airway , increase risk infection . As result , patient often require chest physiotherapy support device aid clearance ( mechanical insufflation-exsufflation ) reduce risk infection . Although evidence support use device , optimal technique setting device clear . Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) new technology involve wear belt sensor around chest provide information well lungs fill air . It allow non-invasive assessment effect secretion clearance technique lung ventilation real-time . This study aim compare well lung fill air three different technique secretion clearance ( clear mucus phlegm airway ) , order determine technique effective , patient NMD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Regional Lung Ventilation Following Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) non-invasive , bedside monitoring technique provide semi-continuous , real-time information regional distribution change electrical resistivity lung tissue due variation ventilation relation reference state . Information gain repeatedly inject small alternate electric current ( usually 5 mA ) high frequency 50 - 80 kHz system skin electrode ( usually 16 ) apply circumferentially around thorax single plane 4th 6th intercostal space . While adjacent pair electrode 'injects ' current ( 'adjacent drive configuration ' ) , remain adjacent passive electrode pair measure difference electric potential . A resistivity ( impedance ) image reconstruct data mathematical algorithm use two dimensional model simplify shape represent thoracic cross-section . The resulting image posse high temporal functional resolution make possible monitor dynamic physiological phenomenon ( e.g. , delay regional inflation recruitment ) breath breath basis . It important realize EIT image base image reconstruction technique require least one measurement well-defined reference state . All quantitative data relate reference indirectly quantify ( relative ) change local lung impedance ( absolute ) . Patients respiratory muscle weakness reduce cough strength cause difficulty clear respiratory secretion . This impaired secretion clearance lead respiratory infection acutely cause small airway occlusion subsequent ventilation-perfusion mismatch adversely effect pulmonary mechanic . The use cough assist device , mechanical insufflation-exsufflation ( MIE ) improve secretion clearance . Although evidence device improve secretion clearance optimal pressure technique require provide effective secretion clearance know . Furthermore use high pressure swing frequently use clinical practice could lead lung derecruitment . The use EIT would allow novel effective method assess ability clear secretion optimise ventilate lung neuromuscular patient poor cough ass post procedure derecruitment . MIE : A pilot physiological study perform patient neuromuscular disease acute ( 10 patient ) chronic ( 10 patient ) secretion management issue require clinical use MIE . These patient study use 3 different clearance strategy low pressure MIE , high pressure MIE standard airway technique . The project ass difference regional ventilation follow augmented airway clearance inform potential endpoint feasibility large trial regard speed recovery respiratory infection patient neuromuscular disease . There paucity data regard physiological efficacy MIE device although clinical consensus regard beneficial adjunct management patient respiratory muscle weakness cause reduction effective secretion clearance less clear optimum protocol achieve secretion clearance . The aim chest physiotherapy achieve clearance airway secretion allow improve gas exchange enhance ventilation perfusion match within lung . The data suggest optimum pressure MIE base around early work achieve enhanced cough peak expiratory flow . More recently high pressure suggest achieve enhance airway clearance . There may potential beneficial effect high pressure MIE enhance airway open insufflation pressure achieve degree lung volume recruitment . Conversely , high insufflation pressure may adversely affect pulmonary cardiac physiology may impact large pressure swing exsufflation . This particularly relevant give increase co-morbid cardiomyopathy occur many congenital neuromuscular disease . The initial phase project would generate pilot data comprehensive physiological evaluation patient neuromuscular disease requirement cough augmentation MIE device . The patient undergo randomise protocol chest clearance standard physio , low pressure high pressure MIE . Data trial allow optimal treatment strategy develop data suggest would provide sufficient data power interventional trial examine important clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
