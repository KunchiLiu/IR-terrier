	<detailed_description>CRPS : Complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) characterize severe disable pain typically limb combination sensory , autonomic , trophic , motor abnormality like tremor dystonia . A distinction make CRPS-1 , usually follow injury ( fracture , surgery ) without nerve lesion , CRPS-2 , distinct nerve lesion identify . Brain mapping study provide increase evidence central nervous system play important role pathogenesis CRPS . Reorganization somatosensory cortex motor network , alter central processing tactile nociceptive stimulus well movement control demonstrate . Functional brain image study suggest volume brain activation differs motor execution motor imagery , distribution cerebral activity tend similar . Under imaginary movement affect hand Gieteling et al . ( 2008 ) observe reduced activation ipsilaterally premotor adjacent prefrontal cortex , frontal operculum , anterior part insula cortex , superior temporal gyrus . Stimulus-driven , functional magnetic resonance imaging , however , time-consuming prone possible confounds , especially clinical population . In perspective resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( RS-fMRI ) , measure cerebral network rest ( absence task ) , probably well suited clinical examination widely use investigate brain network exhibit correlated fluctuation . During recent year , large number study indicate RS-fMRI sufficiently constrain anatomy allow architecture distinct brain system characterize . The default mode network ( DMN ) probably study rest state network . It seem involve several process find negatively modulate chronic pain . Only one publish study investigated cerebral network cerebral connectivity CRPS . Here default mode network display reduce connectivity S1 compare healthy control . This indicate decreased connectivity may key feature cerebral function CRPS patient . No study , however , far investigate reduced connectivity DMN reverse CRPS patient experience pain reduction GMI desensitization treatment . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) another magnetic resonance technique useful revealing microstructural property tissue , particularly cerebral white matter . Chronic pain also associate reduce cognitive functioning . If cause pain processing demand , compete work memory executive function , investigator would expect cognitive capacity improve restore pain successfully treat . Graded Motor Imagery : Graded Motor Imagery ( GMI ) rehabilitation process use treat chronic pain condition movement problem related alteration nervous system CRPS , postamputation limb pain , back pain . The patient train monitored step increase difficulty progress make . The three treatment component include left/right discrimination training , motor imagery exercise mirror observation unaffected limb , appear affected limb . The component perform sequentially , require flexible approach suit individual patient . The imagined movement demonstrate activate motor cortical area similar activate actual execution movement . Desensitization : Tactile desensitization ( D ) use decrease hyperalgesia allodynia repeatedly touch affected area various material . This successfully use clinically treatment CRPS . Hypotheses : The following hypothesis investigate : 1 . Patients , treat GMI + D , experience large pain reduction compare subject D . 2 . Non-responders D alone experience pain reduction D combine GMI . 3 . Patients CRPS display reduce intra-network connectivity DMN compare healthy control . 4 . Reduced intra-network connectivity CRPS associate pain intensity . 5 . Reduced connectivity DMN reverse patient experience pain reduction GMI D treatment . This evident comparison fMRI data obtain treatment . 6 . Microstructure cerebral white matter change intervention . Design : The effect treatment Graded Motor Imagery ( GMI ) D versus D alone compare open , randomize , semi-cross-over case-control design . The study patient allocate either GMI+D D alone . After initial treatment period six week responder ( R ) stay treatment group continue treatment . Non-responders ( NR ) D treatment group offer immediate combine treatment ( GMI+D ) . Randomization : The recruited patient allocate ratio 1:1 randomization fix block size 6 . Analytical model : Self report symptom burden functional capacity compare two treatment group within treatment group ( i.e . comparison treatment patient his/her control ) . The investigator also compare two intervention group ( CRPS patient receive GMI+D D alone ) non-randomized comparison group sex- age-matched healthy person . Continuous , symmetrically distribute variable express mean value 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) construct Student procedure . Proportions present use Binomial model exact 95 % calculate confidence interval . Assumed continuously distribute variable analyze Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) model initial value covariate contingency table analysis use group comparison categorical ranked variable . The sample size calculation base distribution main variable , self-rated limb pain measure Visual Analogue scaling ( VAS ) . Based assumption normality , significance level 5 % ( α = 0.05 ) , power ( β = 0.80 ) clinical relevant difference one time Standard Deviation ( SD ) , 21 patient include two treatment group . There also sex- age-matched comparison group healthy person ( n:21 ) . Interventions : Individually adjust Graded motor imagery ( GMI ) tactile desensitization ( D ) . Measurements : MRI-scanning ( analyse Intra-network connectivity DMN DTI microstructural change white matter ) , Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) Neuropsychological test perform randomization 6 month later . Self report questionnaire perform baseline , treatment period six week , 6 12 month follow . This include demographic variable , comorbidity check list disease related major organ system , pain intensity measure numerical scale pain intensity Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , consumption analgesic questionnaire : CRPS Severity Score , upper limb affect ; Quick DASH ( short form Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand Outcome Measure ) , low limb affect ; Lower extremity functional scale , Impact Event Scale-6 subject adverse life event , Insomnia Severity Index , The Hopkins Symptoms Checklist ( HSCL- 25 ) , Pain Catastrophizing Scale , Perceived self efficacy Bath CRPS Body Perception Disturbance Scale</detailed_description>
