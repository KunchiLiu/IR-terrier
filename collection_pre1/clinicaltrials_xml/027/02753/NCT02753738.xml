	<brief_summary>Background : Conclusive evidence state serotonergic system mediates neuroplasticity early embryonic development brain maturation adulthood . This study aim demonstrate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) enhance learning-dependent neuroplasticity vivo , hereby contribute investigator understand mechanism action therapy SSRIs . Objectives : 1 . To prove positive influence SSRIs structural remodel learning , reflect enhancement gray white matter microstructure , connectivity functionality brain region involve learning process . 2 . To show effect topologically specific , i.e . enhancement plasticity marker find different region depend involvement performance specific learn task . Study design : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , longitudinal mono-center study . 80 healthy subject undergo three MRI scan session : 1. baseline , study entry , 2. 3 week facial/emotional ( n=40 ) Chinese character-meaning learning ( n=40 ) 3. 3 week learn new association administration SSRI placebo . Methods : MRI measurement perform 3 Tesla PRISMA MAGNETOM MR scanner . Changes gray matter microstructure assess use high-resolution structural MRI analyze voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) enable non-invasive investigation neuroplasticity human brain base reduction mean diffusivity associate swell astrocyte increase synaptic activity . Resting-state functional MRI ( fMRI ) allow measurement change functional coupling brain region , fMRI task assess differential activity brain region learn . Relevance implication : This study aim provide evidence SSRIs facilitate cytoarchitectonical restructuring . In addition expand investigator current knowledge trophic effect SSRIs , result study also elucidate interaction serotonergic system change neuronal network learn well behavioral consequence . By probe neurobiological correlate antidepressant anti-anxiety effect SSRIs , study provide rationale target intervention harness neuroplasticity enhance property SSRIs facilitate therapeutic process .</brief_summary>
