	<detailed_description>Copenhagen Baby Heart observational , cohort study &gt; 30.000 child bear Copenhagen area 2016-2018 . Purpose - To assess prevalence congenital inherit heart disease detect prenatally , e.g . bicuspid aortic valve . - To assess diagnostic clinical yield routine echocardiography neonate . - To establish reference value echocardiography ECG Danish neonate . - To establish reference value routine biochemical analysis umbilical cord blood . - To assess prevalence familial hypercholesterolemia Danish newborn . - To assess life-long development cardiovascular disease well condition study association pre- postnatal exposure disease , include life style , environmental genetic factor . Methods Approximately 18.000 child bear yearly Copenhagen area . From 1 . April 2016 - 1 . April 2018 parent newborns offer enrollment research project attend routine prenatal ultrasound .
