	<brief_summary>Some cancer spread , metastasize , brain . When , treatment often involve surgery and/or radiation . Optimal treatment brain metastasis would maximize disease control minimize toxicity ( side effect ) , improve quality life patient . A common type radiation use brain metastasis call whole brain radiation , treat cancer see scan ( i.e. , gross disease ) , small site cancer may visible ( i.e . subclinical disease ) . Fractionation use describe repetitive treatment small dos ( fraction ) total plan dose give separate clinic visit . The common dose regimen 30 Gray ( Gy ) , use 3 Gy per fraction 10 fraction . Previous study suggest use intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) may safer way deliver high dos gross disease lower dose rest brain may contain subclinical disease . This approach may spare rest brain radiation complication side effect . The goal study determine whether use IMRT treat brain metastasis effective current standard whole brain radiation control gross disease whether patient quality life hair loss improve compare previous study use whole brain radiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole Brain Radiation Using IMRT Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical trial utilize intensity modulate whole brain radiation therapy order deliver small , yet effective dose subclinical disease give high dose gross disease patient one brain metastasis . In study , dose 30 Gray ( Gy ) prescribe subclinical site 60 45 Gy visible brain metastasis . There evidence previous study ( include Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 0933 ) hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiotherapy use IMRT may decrease toxicity form memory loss . Patients brain metastasis within region hippocampal avoidance eligible enrollment RTOG 0933 . In contrast , study include group patient since IMRT use deliver high dos visible brain metastasis even though locate within hippocampal avoidance region , also avoid hippocampus . This approach may help preserve memory function . Additionally , temporary ( sometimes permanent ) alopecia result conventional whole brain radiation , IMRT spar skin possibly decrease rate hair loss . Dose scalp limit low possible order decrease risk permanent alopecia study .</detailed_description>
