	<detailed_description>Hypothesis A brief mindfulness-based educational program specifically design obese individual enable gain mastery previously automatic eating activity habit associate enhance mood , decrease inflammation , improve metabolic marker weight control . Specific Aims 1 . To determine mindfulness-based educational program obese person ( BMI ≥30 ) seek gain control eat lifestyle result significant improvement BMI compare control group . 2 . To determine mindfulness-based educational program obese person seek gain control eat lifestyle result significant improvement insulin resistance metabolic physiologic parameter . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS The final design study influence result pilot study entitle Mindful Eating Living I ( MEAL I ) , currently underway . After complete analysis data MEAL I , 50 post-menopausal woman age 55 70 BMI ≥30 kg/m2 recruit screen allow possible screen failure . The goal enroll group 40 participant ( n=20 control , n=20 intervention ) . Randomization Study subject randomize treatment control group outpatient inpatient admission subset . Randomization determine base randomization code devise University New Mexico General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) statistician , randomization process administer GCRC staff person Drs . Sloan Colleran , investigator involve biological aspect study , blind randomization . Enrolled subject randomize follow . Twenty randomize treatment group 20 randomize control group . Those treatment group receive counsel GCRC dietician well mindfulness train via mindfulness curriculum develop MEAL 1 pilot study . Those control group receive counsel GCRC dietician monthly group check-in session . All subject four GCRC visit evaluate metabolic physiologic parameter complete psychometric questionnaire . In-patient Out-patient GCRC subset Of 40 enrolled subject , 24 randomly assign subset patient admit overnight stay order test insulin resistance parameter monitor nocturnal blood pressure . The remain 16 subject GCRC outpatient visit . The rationale in-patient subset logistical . Our protocol call patient admitted baseline evaluation uniform time precede mindfulness intervention , three late time point . All patient need evaluate close time possible , go intervention accord schedule . It logistically possible admit 40 patient overnight stay within 10-14 day interval four different time period . Admitting subset 24 patient overnight stay allow adequate sample size measure insulin resistance . The biological marker measure require large sample size show statistical significance , large sample size achieve without inpatient stay . Screening Subjects screen outpatient GCRC . Screening procedure include thyroid stimulate hormone late night salivary cortisol rule secondary cause obesity basic metabolic panel rule untreated medical condition . Other screen test include history physical , ascertain ability initiate exercise program . As part physical exam , mini mental status exam perform screen cognitive impairment would preclude participate mindfulness training curriculum . Study Design All subject undergo initial GCRC visit , outpatient inpatient base subset assignment . At first visit , medical evaluation , psychometric questionnaire administration laboratory evaluation occur detail . Because fast require lab draw , outpatient subject give snack meal GCRC dietician . Subjects meet GCRC dietician one-hour counseling session weight loss . Those subject inpatient subset visit out-patient GCRC . Instead , admit observed overnight fast follow oral glucose tolerance test also undergo frequent blood pressure monitoring . During admission , information obtain out-patient subset subject also obtain , out-patient subset , subject one-hour counseling session GCRC dietician . These dietician session model standard care include education food pyramid , food choice , activity monitoring , food diary determination caloric goal weight goal . After first GCRC visit , subject randomized treatment group ( n=20 ) begin 6-week two-hour course mindful eating entitle Mindful Eating &amp; Living ( MEAL ) . MEAL mindfulness training program design specifically obese individual . MEAL teach skill lead increase awareness eating , emotion , judgment . Also included information activity nutrition . The goal mindfulness training allow people cultivate awareness behavior provide choice , result less binge overeating , well increased sense control , improve mood , eventually , reduce weight . MEAL 6-week curriculum , taught weekly session 2-hours group 20 people . Specific exercise include group discussion , mindfulness meditation , group eat exercise . Participants use write material CD 's home daily basis . At completion course , treatment subject attend monthly refresher session . Subjects randomize control group undergo mindfulness training . In order provide socially supportive environment similar experience treatment subject , monthly check-in session conduct control subject . At session , subject invite check-in experience weight loss effort include food choice , activity level caloric goal . The first check-in session occur week 1 treatment group 's mindfulness course , second week 6 mindfulness course , monthly session hold week mindfulness refresher session . All subject undergo three additional outpatient inpatient GCRC visit : # 2 ) time completion 6-week mindfulness training , # 3 ) time four week final refresher course # 4 ) time three month final refresher course . The subject control treatment group undergo GCRC visit two-week period . All measure obtain first visit repeat . All subject one-hour meeting GCRC dietician weight loss counsel visit . The purpose GCRC visit admission determine immediate effect , short-term effect long-term effect intervention metabolic , inflammatory , adipocytokine parameter . Out-patient subject give questionnaire advance complete convenience decrease time require out-patient visit . Demographics data obtain baseline . The following data obtain baseline three subsequent GCRC inpatient outpatient visit : medical history , medication profile , smoke status , vital sign , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist/hip measurement , bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) , dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( BXA ) , Neuroticism ( Benet-Martinez ) , Perceived Stress ( Cohen ) , Psychological Well-being Scale ( Ryff ) , Resilience ( Connor ) , Trait Meta-Mood Scale ( Salovey ) , Physical Symptoms ( Moos ) , Positive Negative Affect ( Watson ) , Spirituality Religion ( Fetzer ) , Kentucky Inventory Mindfulness Skills ( Baer ) , Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ( FMI ; Buchheld ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( Beck ) , Beck Anxiety Inventory ( Beck ) , Binge Eating Scale ( Gormally ) , Eating Inventory ( Stunkard ) . At post-mindfulness training visit , meditation log collect treatment group subject ( attach ) . Psychometric data analyze Logan Hall UNM 's main campus . BIOLOGICAL MEASURES The following biological data obtain blood sample , total approximately two teaspoon patient . Each follow measure obtain baseline three additional time point previously describe . Insulin Sensitivity : Obesity highly correlate insulin resistance . Similarly , weight loss improve insulin sensitivity.30 Fasting glucose insulin concentration use estimate severity insulin resistance ( HOMA model ) .41 A second validated measure insulin resistance insulin resistance index ( IRIp ) use formula : peak blood glucose oral glucose load x plasma insulin level/10.56 For study subject fast 12 hour glucose insulin Measured baseline ( HOMA ) 120 minute ( IRIp ) . We anticipate MEAL lead significant improvement insulin sensitivity . Literature review reveals identify 40 % decrease HOMA-IR , give large effect size , require sample size 24 , 12 group.33,34 To see 20 % decrease IRIp , give medium large effect size , require sample size great 24.56 Nevertheless , identify trend IRIp valuable . Furthermore , difficult predict change insulin resistance might see result MEAL , publish study involve drug surgical intervention poor comparison . Fasting lipid profile : Along insulin resistance , obesity associate specific dyslipidemia include hypertriglyceridemia , low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol small dense oxidize low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol.42-44 Weight reduction lead significant improvement hypertriglyceridemia.30 We anticipate mindfulness similarly improve lipid profile . In order see statistically significant reduction triglyceride level approximately 30 % , give medium large effect size see literature , require sample size 40 20 group.33,34 Adiponectin : Adiponectin adipose-derived protein negatively correlate increase adiposity , insulin resistance , inflammatory mediator cardiovascular disease . 31-33 , 45 Recently , significant increase adiponectin level see obese woman follow gastric bypass surgery , result improvement insulin sensitivity.33 A thorough literature search reveal effect mindfulness practice adipocytokine level yet investigate . The MEAL study hypothesize mindfulness practice associate increase adiponectin relate predict weight loss . While MEAL intervention different diet surgical intervention currently cite literature , predict sample size 40 adequate identify statistically significant increase adiponectin approximately 50 % , give medium large effect size see literature.33,40 Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF- α ) , highly sensitive CRP ( C-reactive protein ) : CRP major marker inflammation . Its production liver stimulate network adipocytokines include IL-6 TNF- α.33 , 35 , 36 Type 2 diabetes show preceded state sub-clinical inflammation.35 Additionally , The European Prospective Investigation Cancer Nutrition ( EPIC ) Potsdam Study show increased level IL-6 independently predict risk type 2 diabetes , combine elevation IL-6 TNF-α also associate increased risk.35 Weight loss show induce significant decrease CRP IL-6 associate improvement insulin sensitivity.34 As well , one-year multidisciplinary weight reduction program show decrease IL-6 well TNF-α.37 MEAL thus propose mindfulness-associated weight reduction associate decrease IL-6 , TNF- α high sensitive CRP , associate improved insulin sensitivity estimate fasting insulin fast glucose . A linear correlation IL-6 age establish increase 0.016 pg/ml per year life.47 This find true CRP . Previous study show 40-50 % decrease IL-6 CRP weight loss display medium large effect sizes.33,35 The effect size TNF- α much smaller.33,35 Thus , predict able identify statistically significant decrease IL-6 CRP sample size 40 , unlikely TNF- α result reach significance . Nevertheless , TNF- α central player adipocytokine cascade , identify trend relationship TNF- α marker remain valuable endeavor . The normal increase IL-6 age account analysis enter age covariate . Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) : PAI-1 adipocytokine negatively regulate fibrinolysis thus increase thrombus formation . Its connection cardiovascular disease , insulin resistance type 2 diabetes previously established.38,39 Weight loss associate decrease PAI-1.29 Recently , Health , Aging Body Composition Study show PAI-1 independently associate incident diabetes , association vary sex race.40 We hypothesize PAI-1 level decrease mindfulness practice associate improved insulin sensitivity . To see decrease 30 % PAI-1 level , give medium large effect size see literature , require sample size least 40.40 Cortisol States glucocorticoid excess know associated insulin resistance increase cardiovascular risk . Cortisol production adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) dependent circadian rhythm peak level early morning nadir night . ACTH cortisol secrete independent circadian rhythm response physical psychological stress.51 A previous study examine transcendental meditation cardiovascular risk reveal decreased cortisol levels.8 A study yet publish Waters et al hypothesizes cortisol rhythmicity response meal alter obesity.57 We hypothesize mindfulness training result decrease late night salivary cortisol level decrease serum cortisol level response glucose challenge . The follow anthropometric physiologic parameter obtain : Body Mass Index The Primary outcome change body mass index ( BMI ) . Preliminary statistical analysis reveals show statistically significant decrease BMI 1.25 point , give large effect size , require sample size 24 subject , 12 group , achieve 80 % power alpha 0.05 . Our sample size 40 adequate determine significant improvement BMI . BMI measure record study visit . Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) tool measure total body fat mass.52 While sample size adequate measure significant change total body fat , previous experience demonstrate publication peer review journal , multiple anthropometric measurement beneficial even change significantly . As test fairly ease perform risk subject propose include study design . Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) method measure body composition superior accuracy method BIA BMI.52,53 DEXA also capacity measure fat different compartment include central peripheral . Given small effect size see previous study measure percent body fat , sample size may adequate enough show trend change measure . Of equal importance , however , change body fat distribution . Abdominal adiposity know strong predictor Insulin resistance.54 We therefore hypothesize mindfulness training result decrease amount abdominal compare peripheral adiposity . Waist Hip Ratio Numerous study demonstrate increase waist hip ratio represent significant risk metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , independent BMI . While sample size adequate measure significant change total body fat , previous experience demonstrate publication peer review journal , multiple anthropometric measurement beneficial even change significantly . As test fairly ease perform risk subject propose include study design . Nocturnal blood pressure dip : Most individual exhibit circadian variation blood pressure decrease night-time blood pressure.47 Previous study show patient without hypertension , diminish nocturnal decline blood pressure risk cardiovascular mortality associate elevated level inflammatory marker include PAI-1.48 , 49 To determine effect mindfulness train nocturnal dip blood pressure , admit subset patient overnight stay monitor blood pressure via 24-hour blood pressure monitor . Beginning approximately 7 pm , blood pressure measure every 15 minute . During sleep hour , blood pressure measure every 30 minute . Subjects go home blood pressure monitor return GCRC evening approximately 7 pm.55 In 2005 , Schneider et al publish study show transcendental meditation decrease level hypertension African Americans hypertension one year time period.9 We , therefore , hypothesize nocturnal blood pressure dip lower treatment group mindfulness train control group . SCREENING LABS Thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) : Hypothyroidism cause secondary obesity , hyperthyroidism cause secondary weight loss . While exclusionary criterion pilot study BMI &lt; 35 , information participant ' thyroid status important ultimate trend analysis pilot data . Salivary late night cortisol : Cushing 's syndrome etiology obesity alters metabolism prevents weight loss . Any person elevate salivary late night cortisol level exclude study .
