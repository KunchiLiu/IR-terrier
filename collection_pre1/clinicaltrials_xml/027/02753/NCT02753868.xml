	<brief_title>Acute Effects Intradialytic Exercise Cardiovascular Function Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients kidney failure require hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment die excessively high rate , despite advance HD technique pharmacological therapy . This indicate additional therapeutic strategy need . Intradialytic exercise ( IDEX , exercise HD treatment ) represent low-cost , easy administer treatment strategy could potentially improve cardiovascular function , physical function quality life . However , nephrologists rarely counsel patient increase physical activity level exercise HD treatment , part due lack understanding IDEX knowledge . Providing robust evidence safety effectiveness IDEX , well evaluate impact exercise early v late treatment , could help improve adoption exercise training standard practice HD clinic . Therefore , investigator plan examine impact IDEX timing treatment ( 1st vs 3rd hour ) blood pressure adverse symptom HD patient . The propose study also include various cardiovascular measure allow deep mechanistic understanding cardiovascular physiology IDEX . Such understanding significantly advance field lead improve therapeutic approach , include exercise training , may help mediate deleterious effect renal failure .</detailed_description>
