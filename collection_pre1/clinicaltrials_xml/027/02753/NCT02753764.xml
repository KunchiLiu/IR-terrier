	<brief_summary>This double-blind , placebo control 4 week crossover study investigate efficacy safety AZD7624 ( inhale p38 inhibitor ) corticosteroid resistant ( CR ) asthmatic . For purpose study 10 symptomatic CR asthma patient FEV1 % predict &lt; 80 % normal bronchodilator response , 10 CS asthmatic 10 healthy control recruit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects p38 Inhibitor AZD7624 Corticosteroid Resistant Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part A study , p38 MAPK activation measure CR asthmatic compare CS asthmatic . Assessment p38 MAPK activation whole blood sample 5 CR 5 CS asthma patient perform . After fulfil enrollment criterion blood sample collect asthma patient Visit 1 whole blood evaluation MAPK activation flow cytometry . After initial visit , asthmatic give oral prednisone 1 week patient return spirometry assessment . Patients define CR &lt; 10 % improvement FEV1 % predict observed CS &gt; 12 % improvement FEV1 % predict observe . If least 2 fold increase p-p38 MAPK expression CD14+ cell CR asthma patient demonstrate compare CS asthmatic , Part B trigger . If difference p38 MAPK phosphorylation observe monocyte CR CS asthmatic flow cytometry assessment , study terminate . In Part B study , CR asthmatic randomize treatment AZD7624 placebo one month cross design ; ability AZD7624 inhibit p38 MAPK activity assess CR patient . Five CR asthma patient Part A may also take part Part B . Additional CR ( n=10 total patient require ) CS asthmatic ( n=5 ) recruit part B. Baseline level p38 MAPK biomarkers also assess CR asthmatic compare CS asthmatic healthy volunteer . Patients enrol assessed baseline p38 MAPK activation peripheral blood . Patients re-defined CR CS base change lung function 1 week oral prednisone burst . Levels p38 MAPK activity biomarkers compare CR CS patient ( n=10 group base recruitment Part A Part B ) also compare healthy volunteer ( n=10 ) . After 1 week follow oral prednisone burst , CR patient return undergo bronchoscopy collection BAL bronchial epithelial brush . Blood sample collect evaluation p38 MAPK activation . CS patient undergo bronchoscopy , give blood sample one week oral prednisone burst analysis p38 MAPK activation . Blood sample also collect healthy control initial visit ass p38 MAPK activation . CR patient randomize treatment p38 inhibitor AZD7624 placebo ( 5 patient per group ) . After 4 week treatment AZD7624 placebo , CR patient undergo additional bronchoscopy collection BAL , brush blood . Patients monitor adverse event trial . After completion first block cross treatment , CR patient undergo 1 month wash-out period , , return induce sputum blood collection , undergo second crossover period AZD7624 placebo . After second 4 week treatment block , patient come sputum induction blood collection . In CR asthma patient assessment lung function , asthma control , airway hyperreactivity , p38 MAPK activation peripheral blood , BAL , induce sputum sample cellular responsiveness corticosteroid treatment AZD7624 perform .</detailed_description>
