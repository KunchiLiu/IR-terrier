	<brief_title>Early Detection Ventilator-associated Pneumonia ( VAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diagnostics VAP rely two complementary strategy : meeting pre-defined clinical criterion evidence pathogen low respiratory tract . Mere reliance clinical symptom , radiologic evidence , systemic sign inflammation index compromise pulmonary function reportedly lead misdiagnosis . Current diagnostic procedure recommend gather evidence new progressive lung infiltrate serial chest radiography , together co-existing clinical sign impair respiratory function . Microbiological confirmation pathogen presence require examination airway secretion collect invasive bronchoalveolar lavage demand specific technical skill staff training . Although verification causal pathogens essential introduction target antibiotic therapy , procedure time-consuming qualitative reportedly less 30 % case . Furthermore , currently adopt diagnostic approach base sporadic information sample support continuous monitoring evaluation effect therapeutic intervention . All above-listed flaw shortcoming emphasize need rapid , reliable non-invasive recognition VAP , preferably set would permit continuous bedside monitor timely introduction target drug therapy . The study objective consist sequential collection exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) ICU patient receive invasive ventilation . The EBC sample subject determination volatile organic compound ( VOC ) profile Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy ( SRS ) , upon individual matching routinely collect clinical parameter , may become putative biomarkers early recognition VAP . Evidence accumulate support assumption certain metabolite EBC might display significant profile difference size , hydrophobicity electrical charge . Identification VAP-specific profile VOC provide basis generation data base enable construction standardization bedside device continuous real-time point-of-care monitoring VAP hazard patient invasive ventilation .</detailed_description>
