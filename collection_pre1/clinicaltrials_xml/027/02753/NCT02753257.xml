	<brief_summary>CereDx early proof concept clinical data multi-omic peripheral blood biomarker profile use determine stroke stroke emergency setting . The objective observational cohort clinical study determine clinical utility multi-omic biomarker profile . Primary Study Aims : 1 . The diagnostic test characteristic multi-omic biomarker diagnostic stroke ( ischemic stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) hemorrhagic stroke ) versus stroke ( stroke mimic ) . 2 . The ability multi-omic biomarker profile differentiate ischemic stroke hemorrhagic stroke TIA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At completion project investigator evaluate peripheral blood test determine expression multi-omic biomarker profile differentiate stroke no-stroke emergency set . Two hundred fifty patient age 18 year old present hospital stroke like symptom recruit within 12 hour symptom onset University Cincinnati Medical Center ( UCMC ) and/or participate regional hospital serve UC Stroke Team . Data obtain medical record . Blood research purpose obtain . Research evaluation stroke severity , symptoms outcome perform trained personnel . All clinical evaluation management per standard care . The primary outcome study criterion standard stroke diagnosis . This used estimate diagnostic test characteristic multi-omic biomarker profile peripheral whole blood distinguish stroke ( IS , TIA , SAH , ICH ) versus non-stroke ED patient acute neurologic symptom . Secondly , investigator estimate ability multi-omic biomarker profile differentiate stroke subtypes . A diagnosis stroke define clinical syndrome consistent stroke ( i.e. , sudden onset neurological deficit ) plus image confirmation ( symptom resolution lack image finding TIA ) . Finally , investigator explore relationship multi-omic profile time symptom onset ischemic stroke patient . Descriptive inferential statistic use address aim study . Pattern recognition analysis machine learn employed system level approach determine relevant pathophysiologic pathway associate diagnosis symptom onset time .</detailed_description>
