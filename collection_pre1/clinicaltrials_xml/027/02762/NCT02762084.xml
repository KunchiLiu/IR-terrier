	<detailed_description>This multicenter , double-blind , randomize , vehicle-controlled study design compare efficacy safety patidegib gel , 2 % 4 % comparison vehicle . To eligible study , subject must least 18 year age must meet diagnostic criterion basal cell nevus syndrome BCNS . Approximately 18 subject meet study entry criterion randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive patidegib gel 2 % , patidegib gel 4 % , vehicle gel . One two tube assign study drug dispense subject Baseline visit . Additional tube dispense subsequent visit Week 22 . The study drug apply topically entire face well treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinoma ( SEBs ) anatomical site twice daily 26 week treatment . Information report observed adverse event obtain visit . An abbreviated physical examination perform Baseline , Week 14 , Week 26 . At Baseline Weeks 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 , 26 , visible BCCs ( exclude area knee ) identify Investigator , circle ink , photograph , measure , record body diagram . Treatment target SEBs define five SEBs face and/or anatomical area identify Baseline SEBs treat 26 week treatment phase . If subject 5 eligible previously untreated facial SEBs ( exclude tumor nose eyelid ) tumor subject 's 5 baseline treatment target SEBs non-facial baseline SEBs treat study medication .</detailed_description>

First degree relative basal cell nevus syndrome PTCH1 gene mutation normal tissue Minor Criteria Macrocephaly Congenital malformation : cleft lip palate , frontal bossing , `` coarse face '' , moderate severe hypertelorism Skeletal abnormality : sprengel deformity , mark pectus deformity , mark syndactyly digit Radiological abnormality : bridging sella turcica , vertebral anomaly hemivertebrae , fusion elongation vertebral body , model defect hand foot , flame shape lucencies hand foot Ovarian fibroma Medulloblastoma 4 . The subject must history least 10 BCCs toto present Baseline and/or treat within 24 month prior screen . 5 . The subject Baseline total least 5 previously untreated SEBs ( great diameter 5 mm great face exclude nose periorbital skin , 9 mm great nonfacial area exclude skin knee ) , document clinically Investigator Baseline . Untreated define previous surgical topical intralesional drug treatment . Previous treatment systemically administer drug 6 month prior Baseline consider previous treatment long clinical evidence resistance oral HH ( e.g. , vismodegib , patidegib , sonidegib ) inhibitor . Baseline treatment target SEBs must exceed diameter &gt; 2cm . At least one tumor must appropriate 2 mm punch biopsy biomarker analysis Baseline Week 6 visit . If subject 5 facial , exclude periorbital nasal skin , SEBs Baseline , nonfacial SEBs treatment target SEBs . 6 . The subject willing SEBs biopsied biomarkers plasma collected measure drug level require protocol . 7 . The subject willing abstain application nonstudy topical prescription counter medication facial skin within 5 cm treatment target SEBs anatomical area duration study except prescribed Investigator . Moisturizers emollient allowable . Subjects encourage use sunscreen sunscreen protection factor ( SPF 15 high ) least daily expose skin site . 8 . Female subject must negative serum pregnancy test Screening . 9 . If subject male female sexual partner childbearing potential couple willing use two effective method birth control duration trial one month last application gel . A female childbearing potential sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month , must agree use two effective method contraception duration study least 1 month last study drug application . The two form birth control authorize define use barrier method contraception ( condom spermicide ) association one follow method birth control : bilateral tubal ligation ; combine oral contraceptive ( estrogens progesterone ) implant injectable contraceptive stable dose least 1 month prior Baseline ; hormonal intrauterine device ( IUD ) insert least 1 month prior Baseline . 10 . The subject willing contact study center primary skin care physician ( PSCP ) visit provide study center detail visit treatment skin tumor . 11 . The subject willing forego treatment treatment target baseline SEBs except Investigator and/or primary care giver believe delay treatment potentially might compromise health subject . 1 . The subject woman childbearing potential . This proscription base key role HH pathway embryogenesis , know preclinical teratogenic effect systemic cyclopamine , naturally occur inhibitor smoothen , unknown level systemic exposure follow topical application human . A female childbearing potential sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month . 2 . The subject use topical product face within 5 cm treatment target SEB systemic therapy might interfere evaluation study medication study . Specifically include use : Topical glucocorticoid 30 day prior screen Retinoids ( e.g. , etretinate , isotretinoin , tazarotene , tretinoin , adapalene ) systemically topically &gt; 5 % alphahydroxy acid ( e.g. , glycolic acid , lactic acid ) 5fluorouracil imiquimod ( except topical treatment discrete BCCs ) systemically topically skin six month prior entry . Systemic chemotherapy within one year prior screening . ( Note : field therapy topically apply treatment do long apply within 5 cm treatment target tumor ) . Known inhibitor HH signal pathway ( e.g. , vismodegib , patidegib , sonidegib ) topically systemically within 6 month entry study . 3 . The subject history hypersensitivity ingredient study medication formulation . 4 . The subject unable unwilling make good faith effort return followup visit test . 5 . The subject uncontrolled systemic disease . 6 . The subject clinically important history liver disease , include viral hepatitis , current alcohol abuse , cirrhosis . 7 . The subject condition situation Investigator 's opinion may put subject significant risk , could confound study result , could interfere significantly subject 's participation study . This include history skin condition disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory finding give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render patient high risk treatment complication . 8 .
