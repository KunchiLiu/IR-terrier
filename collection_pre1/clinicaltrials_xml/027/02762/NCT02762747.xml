	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial Pre-peritoneal Drainage After Totally Extra-peritoneal Hernioplasty Inguinal Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernia common disease cause significant morbidity leave untreated . With advance laparoscopic approach extra-peritoneal hernioplasty , significantly reduce post-operative pain lead well quality life high acceptance patients.However , similar traditional Litchenstein approach , post operative seroma formation still common problem encounter surgery . Numerous method describe reduce chance seroma formation , however , none proven effective except pre-peritoneal drainage . There currently 2 large retrospective non-randomized cohort study evaluate effectiveness preperitoneal drainage available reference . We therefore study feasibility efficacy preperitoneal drainage large scale randomize trial . Patient fulfill inclusion criterion consent surgery study recruit . A standardized pre-peritoneal dissection mesh placement adopt . Immediately deflation pre-peritoneal space , randomization perform call research assistant study group use computer generate code . Drain place 23 hour operation ultrasonography perform immediately removal drain . USG repeat post-operative 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 1 year surgery . For non-drain group , fake drain attach skin wound achieve double blind patient assessor . In addition seroma , patient demographic secondary outcome include post-operative pain score , discomfort , foreign body sensation , patient satisfaction , infection , recurrence , etc study .</detailed_description>
