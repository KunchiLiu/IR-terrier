	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) common procedure perform cardiac surgeon . More complicated surgery enable development cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) 1930s ; CABG procedure increase peak 500,000 2000 , although number decrease somewhat last decade . In 2010 150,000 major cardiac procedure involve CABG ; 18,008 involve aortic valve replacement CABG ; 2,378 involved mitral valve replacement CABG ; 4,635 involved mitral valve repair CABG . This procedure costly ; 2010 mean hospital charge CABG valve procedures $ 124,404 $ 171,270 mean length hospital stay 9 11 day in-hospital death rate 1.8 % 3.9 % , respectively . Post-operative atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common adverse event follow CABG , experience 20-50 % patient ; high incidence AF occur third post-operative day . Post-operative AF associate overall poor prognosis result 4-fold increase disable stroke cognitive impairment , 3-fold risk cardiac-related death , increase length hospital stay . These risk increase change composition patient population last 10 year : patient old sicker , present complex disease state co-morbidities , severe coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , diabetes , previous cardiac surgery mechanical support device placement , complex pharmacological history . A high prevalence AF increase transfusion among CPB patient also report , suggest link increase plasma load inflammatory marker mediator transfuse red cell . Reduction AF various drug moderately effective , involve either rate control beta blocker rate conversion amiodarone myocardial damage process initiate AF already occur . Decreasing incidence post-operative AF , hence morbidity mortality high-risk CABG patient , could fruitfully approach target upstream combine process inflammation coagulation activation induce surgical insult associate ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) . During CPB , heart subject ischemic period vary duration . The cardiac tissue point electrically rest metabolic demand accordingly low . However , also severely diminished supply oxygen nutrient . This result slow direct myocardium cellular damage , increase ischemia duration increase . However , reperfusion oxygenate blood , oxidative stress actually peaks accumulated oxidative substrate cellular depletion reductive compound . Cardiac damage relate ischemia-reperfusion exacerbate presence co-morbidities , diabetes CAD , pathologies significant reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) injury component . High level ROS myocardium contribute electrical structural remodel cardiac muscle , result development AF . I/R-related oxidative stress ROS activation contribute cell damage modify protein DNA phospholipid , result lipid peroxidation thiol-group oxidation , turn link induction inflammatory cascade . Lipids important small-molecule metabolite role wide variety physiological process . The lipidome eukaryotic cell contain thousand lipid entity structurally chemically regulate cell membrane , store energy , precursor bioactive metabolite . Defects lipid regulation metabolism therefore significant contributor disease pathophysiology . In particular , eicosanoids lipid mediator link coagulation inflammatory pathway ; intracellular oxidant specie essential mediator eicosanoids synthesis pathway . Thus lipidomic analysis potential novel tool identification driver underlie pathogenesis new diagnostic biomarkers . During CABG , total peroxide ( TP ) oxidative stress index approximately double Increased post-bypass plasma level inflammatory marker C-reactive protein ( CRP ) platelets leukocyte activation observe CPB . Increases oxidative stress associate CPB correlate reduction total plasma antioxidant capacity . These observation interest antioxidant molecule inhibits oxidation molecule . Oxidation chemical reaction transfer electron hydrogen substance oxidizing agent . Oxidation reaction produce free radical . In turn , radical start chain reaction . When chain reaction occur cell , cause damage death cell . Antioxidants terminate chain reaction remove free radical intermediate , inhibit oxidation reaction auto-oxidation ; hence antioxidant often reduce agent . The investigator propose cell damage induce oxidative stress I/R injury could prevent and/or inhibit antioxidant supplementation . Specifically investigator hypothesize high-dose intravenous ( IV ) vitamin C supplementation ameliorate ROS therefore damp upstream inflammatory process , lead reduction downstream adverse event demonstrable link inflammation process , AF . Vitamin C viable therapeutic candidate powerful antioxidant excellent safety profile , emerge history reduce inflammatory marker critically ill traumatically injured patient . Scattered trial indicate possible benefit vitamin C reduce incidence post-CABG AF ( see Literature search ) . An antioxidant vitamin C act scavenger intracellular oxidant specie ; essential mediator eicosanoids synthesis pathway , expect vitamin C supplementation would decrease thrombotic potential eicosanoid-mediated pathway , thromboxane ( TBX ) production pathway . Impaired cardiac blood flow clot formation associate AF contributes congestive heart failure stroke ; therefore reduction thrombotic potential another essential feature propose therapeutic agent . The propose pilot study describe represent marked advance previously-reported trial ( ) study design direct towards minimization systemic bias , ( b ) investigator perform simultaneous comparison multivariate inflammatory coagulation profile change immediate post-operative time period inflammatory change expect maximum . The novelty approach systems-level analysis lipid interact moiety ; new technology allow rapid quantitative analysis 150 lipid mediator sample , time cost effective manner .</detailed_description>
