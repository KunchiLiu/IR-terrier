	<detailed_description>Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( ARMD ) common cause blindness adult population Western World . It affect macula - region retina rich photoreceptors responsible central vision . Despite manifest importance , ethiology ARMD remain poorly understood . Population-based study demonstrate complex ethiology , contribution combination genetic environmental factor . Genome-wide association study reveal presence locus associate susceptibility wide range gene , include gene involve complement system , cholesterol homeostasis , growth factor diffusion angiogenesis . Smoking identified major environmental factor . Two major form ARMD clinically distinguishable : dry wet form . The latter represent aggressive clinical subgroup , characterize abnormal growth new blood vessel ( neovascularization ) macula , thus lead accumulation fluid retina , bleeding , progression fibrosis , finally loss central vision . The pathogenesis neovascularization fully understood , although VEGF pathway well know involve angiogenesis implicate development new vessel macula . The VEGFs specific potent stimulators angiogenesis . VEGF-A 45kD glycoprotein bind transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor , VEGFRs , activate cascade downstream factor . VEGF-A strong pro-angiogenic effect retina promote proliferation , sprout tube endothelial cell . It bind least two receptor -VEGFR1 VEGFR2 , although proangiogenic activity appear mediate VEGFR2 . Expression VEGFR2 isoform lack intracellular signal domain transmembrane domain , represent soluble form receptor , inactivate VEGF extracellularly . Similarly , molecule bind inactivate VEGF develop treatment ARMD apply ARMD clinic intra vitreal injection . These include antibody , recombinant receptor fusion protein synthetic aptamer . The anti-VEGFA antibody - ranibizumab bevacizumab , off-label , associate limited side-effects significant therapeutic improvement , become standard treatment wet form ARMD . Indeed , example first clinical trial ranibizumab , monthly injection ranibizumab demonstrated average gain visual acuity 6.6 10.7 ETDRS letter 24 month . However , currently clinical centre apply modify treatment protocol . Commonly use initial load dose three consecutive monthly injection subsequent follow-up administration additional injection depend evolution visual acuity , optical coherence tomography fluorescein angiography data . 25 % ARMD patient show significant improvement visual acuity , 70 % maintain show slightly increase visual acuity , remain 5 percent patient fail respond treatment continue loose vision . The difference see response anti VEGF treatment ARMD patient suggestive presence factor influence effect drug . Some could genetic variant within gene involve ARMD pathogenesis VEGF pathway . Few association marker within gene previously find related pathogenesis ARMD find . It remain unknown whether variant involve anti VEGF treatment response could influence therapeutic outcome . A study demonstrate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) VEGFR1 rs7993418 ( TAC codon ) form associate resistance anti VEGF therapy carcinoma patient . This specific genotype lead increase expression VEGFR1 without change amino acid content protein . The increased VEGFR1 protein likely due high efficiency messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) translation . The purpose trial evaluate association panel select polymorphic marker VEGF pathway response therapy anti VEGF antibody ARMD . The hypothesis individual genotype influence response anti VEGF . This lead identification genetic biomarkers allow treatment individualization optimization visual outcome .</detailed_description>
