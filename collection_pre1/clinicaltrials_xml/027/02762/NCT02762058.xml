	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Mirror Therapy Those With Acquired Brain Injury : A Clinical Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator currently run mirror therapy pilot project Hamilton Health Sciences Rehabilitation Program . Mirror therapy successfully used people injury stroke type brain injury affect movement one side body . Mirror therapy involve place mirror affect limb angle reflect unaffected limb . This create visual illusion move unaffected limb also result movement affect limb . This theorized aid recovery motor system brain . Virtual Reality ( VR ) also use people stroke brain injury many study VR show positive result . In study , investigator combine VR mirror therapy . The investigator design special new system use VR headset make appear limb move unaffected limb move . The investigator go people complete virtual task wear specially program headset . The task everyday activity person might perform use two hand . Ultimately , investigator hope determine whether difference VR mirror therapy regular mirror therapy improve upper limb function .</detailed_description>
