	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) lead cause maternal mortality morbidity worldwide , cause commonly poor uterine muscle contraction delivery baby placenta . The first line agent use prevention treatment PPH oxytocin , act bind oxytocin receptor ( OTR ) find myometrial cell cause uterine contraction . Oxytocin also use augmentation labor spontaneous labor deem ineffective . It administer intravenously progressively high dos , effective contraction achieve vaginal delivery result . However , augmentation determine fail , Cesarean delivery ( CD ) perform . One potential problem oxytocin use delivery lose effectiveness uterus previously pre-exposed high dos and/or prolonged duration labor . This phenomenon term OTR desensitization , result attenuation myometrial contractility induce subsequent oxytocin administration , well PPH due poor uterine tone . Furthermore , oxytocin produce potentially fatal maternal hemodynamic adverse effect administer high dos , advantageous able use low dose possible obtain good uterine muscle tone . The objective study get good understand signal pathway govern desensitization , resensitization contractility pregnant human myometrium . The investigator wish investigate effect increase recovery period expression pattern OTR signal pathway desensitize pregnant human myometrium . This study help shed light molecular mechanism responsible desensitization oxytocin-induced myometrial contractility , provide insight potential therapeutic target reduce incidence PPH complication associate use increase concentration oxytocin . The hypothesis expression phosphorylation pattern OTR downstream protein alter desensitized myometrium , pattern change increase rest period re-exposure oxytocin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinically , woman require augmentation labor increase risk PPH due great exposure oxytocin duration dose exogenous administration , presumably mediate OTR desensitization . In current practice , upon diagnosis failure progress labor augmentation , oxytocin administration discontinue , long indication immediate delivery , variable duration proceed CD . Due high likelihood OTR desensitization patient population , would clinically relevant determine molecular mechanism underlie action . A recent study investigator ' group , look rest time require recovery resensitization OTR follow desensitization , show improvement oxytocin-induced myometrial contractility either 30 , 60 90 minute rest period . The reason resensitization occur remain unknown , possible explanation OTRs undergo structural functional change desensitization prohibit recovery . The investigator propose use previously establish in-vitro model labour augmentation OTR desensitization ( use pregnant human myometrium isometric tension record device ) investigate molecular mechanism govern OTR desensitization resensitization stop administration oxytocin . Investigation signal pathway responsible process , well oxytocin-induced contraction control in-vitro system aid understand kinetics OTR-oxytocin system provide insight potential pharmacotherapeutic target reduce incidence PPH .</detailed_description>
