	<brief_summary>Patients HFpEF suffer exercise intolerance , increase risk hospitalization mortality , poor QOL . Unlike patient HFrEF , drug device therapy appear consistently beneficial treating problem . However , increase evidence suggest exercise train effective partially reverse exercise intolerance improve quality life patient . Most trial date conduct control research setting , versus integrate patient standard CR program . Also , since functional capacity relate outcome patient , exercise strategy aim improve fitness warrant . One strategy use high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) CR setting , strategy show effective patient type CVD . This project design test feasibility incorporate patient CR setting , train use methodology ( i.e. , HIIT ) already show yield ( patient CVD ) great gain fitness compare achieve use standard MCT alone .</brief_summary>

Systolic dysfunction , per ejection fraction &lt; 50 % ; mild ( grade I ) diastolic dysfunction 2 . Initial clinical response observe first 3 visit CR baseline exercise test would preclude participation study overall ( e.g. , new onset/troublesome arrhythmia warrant investigation ) undergo HIIT ( e.g. , claudication , balance issue ) 3 . Patients exercise induce angina CR CPX test ST segment depression representative myocardial ischemia CPX test 4 . Pregnant plan become pregnant 5 .
