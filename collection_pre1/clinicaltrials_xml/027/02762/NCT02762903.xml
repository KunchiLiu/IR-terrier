	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess clinical effectiveness two different technique use subscapularis tendon repair total shoulder replacement . The investigator hypothesize participant receive new repair technique call less tuberosity osteotomy low rate postoperative subscapularis muscle dysfunction rupture compare receive traditional tenotomy repair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lesser Tuberosity Osteotomy Subscapularis Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subscapularis tendon mobilize total shoulder arthroplasty order gain anterior access glenohumeral joint . Postoperative subscapularis dysfunction recognize frequently report &gt; 65 % patient follow shoulder arthroplasty soft-tissue repair . Subscapularis dysfunction associate poor functional outcome include tendon rupture anterior instability , major indication revision surgery . Recent study suggest standard subscapularis tenotomy primary tendon repair may lead failure repair decrease functional outcome compare novel less tuberosity osteotomy technique . The investigator study aim validate result current literature prospective randomize controlled trial , knowledge report topic.Investigators compare clinical outcome follow two technique total shoulder arthroplasty . Participants undergo total shoulder replacement randomize receive either less tuberosity osteotomy tenotomy primary subscapularis tendon repair . All procedure conduct study consider standard care except ultrasound , conduct research purpose subscapularis tenotomy group . Postoperative outcome monitor objectively subjectively routine postoperative office visit use physical exam , image ( X-rays ultrasound ) , questionnaire . If hypothesis proven true , investigator establish gold-standard evidence use new osteotomy technique improve patient satisfaction mobility follow shoulder arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
