	<brief_title>A Study Vitamin B12 Status Children With Infantile Tremor Syndrome Pre Infantile Tremor Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Materials method STUDY SETTING : Hospital base study ( Advanced Pediatrics Centre , PGIMER ) STUDY PERIOD : July 2015 December 2016 STUDY DESIGN : Cross sectional , Observational Enrolment criterion Inclusion criterion ( case ) 1 . Either sex , age le 3 year 2 . Clinical diagnosis Infantile Tremor Syndrome evidence follow feature : [ Developmental delay regression WITH history exclusive predominant breast feed WITH two follow ; skin pigmentation , hair depigmentation , tremor ] ITS:1 2 plus tremor PreITS:1 2 without tremor Exclusion criterion ( case ) 1 . Parents refuse consent 2 . Later confirmation alternative diagnosis 3 . Patient receive oral injectable Vitamin B12 past 6 month Controls ( C ) - Normally develop child - Inclusion criterion Developmentally normal child suffer acute chronic neurological illness - Exclusion criterion 1.Parent/individual refuse consent 2.Patient receive oral injectable Vitamin B12 past 6 month PLAN OF THE STUDY All consecutive patient present Pediatric Emergency OPD Advanced pediatric Centre suspect Infantile tremor syndrome screen inclusion study . Those find eligible would include informed consent . Baseline clinical demographic profile record proforma..The study aim assessment vitamin B12 status child ITS . The various manifestation syndrome , presentation , clinical picture , development profile , various haematological biochemical marker would study detailed manner record proforma ( annexure ) . The first section proforma target clinical picture disease . The presenting feature record . The presenting complaint anything range episode upper respiratory tract infection apparently healthy child present delay milestone . A brief history development milestone achieve gross motor , fine motor , language social milestone important form basis screen developmentally delay child .A feed history take important disease frequently see child exclusively/predominantly breastfed . A detailed examination child would do finding record . Skin hair change classical disease hence study recorded detail . A neurological examination do study neurological status child presence extrapyramidal symptom . Hematological index record . Plasma Vitamin B 12 , folate , homocysteine level studied.Urine methylmalonic acid along TMS/GCMS also do part project . Other investigation do per case profile . Any investigation do case part treatment diagnostic evaluation like liver function test , renal function test , EEG , CT , MRI also record . The second section proforma consist assessment health nutritional status mother . It aim establish direct relation maternal health development ITS like picture child . Mother 's dietary history take find whether maternal diet lack Vitamin B12 folate . A targeted neurological examination do look neurological manifestation vitamin B12 deficiency form posterior column tract sensation presence peripheral neuropathy . A lab estimation maternal Vitamin B12 , folate homocysteine level also do record . Blood sample : Sampling would do along routine sample far possible avoid additional prick child . Plasma would immediately separate store test Vitamin B12 , homocysteine , methylmalonic acid folate level . This blood would take sample already take test do child . Confidentiality record would maintain . The study purely observational influence management child . Though standard policy child ITS would receive Vitamin B12 , folate supplement diet counsel do . Blood TMS-acylcarnitine propionylcarnitine along evaluation urine methyl malonic acid part GCMS also study case control . Mother 's blood sample also take explain entire aim objective study take full free voluntary inform consent . This would also benefit mother way identified deficiency give supplement overcome deficiency . Control sample take child age group admit ailment . A 2 ml sample take sample already draw test do child . The control also stand benefit child find deficient advise Vitamin B12 folate supplementation immediately . Vitamin B12 folate level also study mother 50 control . All mother find deficient advise Vitamin B12 folate .</detailed_description>
