	<brief_summary>Epidural analgesia commonly use labor pain relief due safety effectiveness . Despite high success rate , epidural technique remain somewhat blind technique failure continue occur . Unfortunately , image technique use bedside determine proper position epidural catheter . The trans-catheter electric stimulation test ( TCEST ) successfully use purpose . This test occasionally perform situation immediate confirmation proper epidural catheter location deem necessary . The test help predict epidural might fail appropriate measure could immediately implement . There one duration electrical stimulus ( 0.2 millisecond ) use majority study clinical practice . With duration stimulation , vast majority case show unilateral motor response lower limbs TCEST . Studies stimulation peripheral nerve ( nerve arm legs ) show electrical stimulus long duration able stimulate nerve far away . Since nerve epidural space similar composition peripheral nerve , investigator expect see high rate bilateral response long duration stimulus . The investigator also hope show bilateral response predictive well function epidural . The investigator hypothesize incidence bilateral response TCEST high 1.0 m pulse width compare 0.1 m pulse width . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize bilateral motor response associate 1.0 m pulse width predictive symmetry sensory motor block low consumption local anesthetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize double-blind control study . After recruitment patient , epidural anesthesia perform standard fashion employ investigator ' institution fellow staff . Spinal ultrasound use prior perform epidural catheter insertion . The trans-catheter electric stimulation test ( TCEST ) perform 0.1ms pulse width 1ms pulse width . The order two pulse width apply randomly decide computer . The test dose local anesthetic administer , TCEST repeat 5 minute later . Again , pulse width ( 0.1ms , 1ms ) use , order apply decide randomly . Following second testing , load dose standard anesthetic solution administer . The sensory level ice test 20 minute follow injection load dose bupivacaine fentanyl . The sensory level assess sacral thoracic level , bilaterally . The motor response pattern record TCESTs perform , relationship pulse width response pattern determine .</detailed_description>
