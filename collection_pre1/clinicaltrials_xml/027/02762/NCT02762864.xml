	<brief_summary>To compare effect PRU ( platelet ( P2Y12 ) reaction unit ) -guided treatment change 1. time initial leg pain time termination exercise test pain , evaluate graded stationary bicycle test , 2. low limb perfusion use MRI blood oxygenation-level dependent ( BOLD ) dynamic contrast enhancement sequence measure extracellular volume fraction ( ECV ) indicator fibrosis severity calf muscle , one 52 week post-revascularization patient peripheral artery disease undergone endovascular revascularization -/+ bypass surgery moderate severe claudication ischemic rest pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-operative Treatment Diabetic Peripheral Arterial Disease Guided Platelet Reactivity Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assign PRU-guided non-PRU-guided group . In non-PRU -target group , dual antiplatelet therapy clopidogrel 75 mg aspirin 100 mg daily continue 6 month procedure patient follow single antiplatelet therapy clopidogrel 75 mg daily throughout follow-up period . In PRU-target group , dual antiplatelet therapy protocol non-PRU-target group patient PRU &lt; 234 second . However , patient PRU-target group PRU ≥234 second , rescue medicine add keep PRU &lt; 234 second .</detailed_description>
