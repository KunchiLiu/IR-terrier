	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety feasibility administer investigational drug ( mean Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved kidney cancer ) prior surgical treatment kidney cancer . The first drug call MEDI4736 , second drug call tremelimumab . Both drug work attach certain protein immune cell goal stimulate immune response cancer cell . This phase 1 trial , primary goal identify treatment safe possible side effect give prior surgery kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant MEDI 4736 +/- Tremelimumab Locally Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary Objective • To investigate safety feasibility neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dosing durvalumab +/- tremelimumab patient localize renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Secondary Objectives - To assess immune response neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dosing durvalumab +/- tremelimumab patient localize RCC measure increased density tumor-infiltrating CD8 T-cells . - To assess antitumor effect neoadjuvant durvalumab +/- tremelimumab patient RCC measure change tumor size . Correlative Objectives - To explore pharmacodynamic microbiome marker response checkpoint inhibition pre- post-treatment blood tissue sample - To understand change immunological milieu mediate pre-surgical immune checkpoint blockade - To investigate correlation PD-L1 expression pre-treatment biopsy increase immune infiltration neo-adjuvant treatment . Study Design : This study single-arm open-label phase Ib study neoadjuvant durvalumab +/- tremelimumab localize / locally advance , non-metastatic RCC patient suitable nephrectomy . Upon selection appropriate study , patient undergo compute tomography ( CT ) -guided biopsy renal mass obtain histological confirmation diagnosis , immunologic characterization RCC tumor . Peripheral blood also draw time screening . Patients subsequently receive systemic neoadjuvant treatment one 5 cohort define . Following systemic therapy , patient undergo nephrectomy . Type surgery ( open vs. minimally invasive , radical vs. partial ) template lymph node dissection discretion surgeon . Timing surgery relation adverse event and/or treatment adverse event neoadjuvant dose study drug discretion surgeon . Adjuvant therapy administer within 4-6 week surgery . Subsequent follow-up complete assess adverse event resolution long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
