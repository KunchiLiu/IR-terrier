	<detailed_description>To identify novel genetic variant cause skeletal dysplasia Qatari population additionally develop understanding variant influence skeletal biology molecular cellular level . Achieving goal split two aim : - Aim 1 : Perform clinical characterization study group patient various form skeletal dysplasia see pediatric orthopedics clinic Hamad Medical center , HMC . This follow whole exome genome sequence analysis search novel pathogenic variant responsible clinical presentation patient - Aim 2 : The gene variant identify Aim 1 characterize determine effect osteoblast chondrocyte differentiation function . All subject recruit pool patient see Pediatric Orthopedic Consultants Bone Joint Institute . Subjects come clinic standard care . They identify visit candidate study . They tell study physician . If patient interested participation , physician introduce CRC him/her proceed consent process . Consenting study procedure might perform visit time allow , new schedule visit arrange time . This research also involve pedigree creation . Secondary subject ( family member relative ) tell study research subject . The secondary subject able read copy consent form , think participation , interested tell contact Investigators . A suitable time arrange , appropriate member research team , secondary subject visit clinic order proceed consent process study procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All included individual must provide informed consent 2 . Patients identified skeletal dysplasia 3 . All ethnic background acceptable 4 . Disease must genetic evident environmental cause . 5 . Evidence Mendelian Transmission determine fulfil one follow criterion : 1 . Multiple affect family member ( least firstdegree relative disease ) 2 . History consanguinity 3 . Severe disease newborn absence family history 4 . Syndromic disease single individual 5 . Congenital abnormality affect major organ system ( ) 6 . Mendelianized extremes common disease ( e.g . bilateral developmental dysplasia hip ) 6 . All age include 7 . Rare disease rare form know diseases 8 . Unaffected family member relatives individual primary syndrome 1 . Individuals consent include 2 . Individuals molecular diagnosis already establish alternative method ( e.g . karyotype know gene mutation ) 3 . Diseases environmental factor likely cause ( e.g . Traumatic bone injury Rickets ) 4 . Diseases late age onset rule Mendelian transmission 5 . Common Diseases late age onset rule Mendelian transmission ( e.g.Osteoporosis )</criteria>
