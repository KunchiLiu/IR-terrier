	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) work compare stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) stereotactic ablative radiation therapy ( SABR ) patient liver cancer remain attempt remove cancer make ( residual ) come back ( recurrent ) . TACE minimally invasive , image-guided treatment procedure use catheter deliver chemotherapy medication embolization material blood vessel lead tumor . SBRT SABR may able send radiation directly tumor cause less damage normal liver tissue . It yet know whether TACE effective SBRT SABR treat patient persistent recurrent liver cancer undergone initial TACE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoembolization Compared With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Residual Recurrent Liver Cancer Undergone Initial Transarterial Chemoembolization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine freedom local progression ( FFLP ) TACE versus ( v ) SABR patient persistent hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) TACE . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) TACE v SABR patient persistent HCC initial TACE . II . To determine overall survival ( OS ) TACE v SABR persistent HCC . III . To determine toxicity associate TACE SABR persistent HCC . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients undergo TACE . ARM II : Beginning within 2 week radiation set-up scan within 4 week fiducial seed implantation ( applicable ) , patient undergo image guide SBRT 3 fraction within 1 week 5 fraction within 2 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1-2 week , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
