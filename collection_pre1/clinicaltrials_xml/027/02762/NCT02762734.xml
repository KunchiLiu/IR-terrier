	<brief_title>Prevention Recurrence Suicide Attempt Adolescent Sending SMS ( MEDIACONNEX )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In industrialised country , incidence SA among adolescent ( age 10-19 year old ; 1 ) estimate 7 % 9 % ( 2-3 ) . Thirty percent adolescent make SA year . It appear previous SA `` independent powerful predictor futur attempt '' ( 4 ) . Moreover , one risk factor commit suicide make SA , particular year precede suicide . To prevent suicide , thus important prevent SA particularly recurrence . Research adolescent suicide attempter focus general risk protective factor ( 5-7 ) . But despite knowledge characteristic , rate SA recurrence n't decrease . So , creative care proposal limit . An early study conclude adolescent suicide attempter contact care system , risk SA recurrence ( 8 ) . These last decade , news way care prevent SA recurrence develop adult ' suicide attempter . These news care may divide 2 category : `` intensive care '' `` connectedness '' care ( 9 ) . The intensive care example specific therapies cognitive-behaviour-therapy dialectical behavior therapy ( 10-12 ) , partial hospitalization ( 13 ) , brief psychological intervention patient 'home ( 14 ) ... And treatment , rate recurrence decrease ( 11-13 ) . The `` connectedness care '' base fact `` keep touch '' patient encourage call case crises order avoid recurrence . Motto al . pioneer field connectedness 70 send letter regularly suicide attempt ( 15 ) . It might also send postcard ( 16-17 ) , phone call ( 18-19 ) SMS ( 20 ) … As intensive care , care may positive result rate recurrence number recurrence . By way , different care diverse result depend sex personality patient ( 21 ) . There clinical relevance sort care `` connectedness '' one easy use , low cost moreover , seem appropriate adolescent . Indeed , therapeutic alliance young patient easy install `` intensive care '' might prevent join care . Moreover , another study Nancy , France , fact lose follow-up caregiver appear risk factor recurrence , even 10-year suicide attempt . So , fact `` keep touch '' adolescent suicide attempt important probably could accept easily idea one medium often use : short message system ( SMS ) . There yet MobilHealth program adolescent adults specialty good result ( 22-24 ) . MEDIACONNEX study also propose ass effectiveness new way connectedness adolescent SA : base send SMS ( mail new medium ) , period 6 month suicide attempt , order allow recourse care easily limit risk suicidal recurrence . Design The MEDIACONNEX study simple blind , parallel group multisite randomize control trial compare program base SMS ( mail new medium ) addition usual care ( group MEDIA ) `` usual care '' ( group CLASSIC ) provide adolescent attempted suicide treat in-child adolescent psychiatry unit hospital East France . The comparison base rate recurrence suicide attempt two group . The primary objective determine whether use SMS ( mail new medium ) keep touch adolescent suicide attempter addition usual care , compare usual care , reduce delay recurrence suicide attempt 6 month SA . Secondary objective : Determine whether use SMS ( mail new medium ) keep touch adolescent suicide attempter addition usual care , compare usual care , improve evolution social network 6 month Determine whether use SMS ( mail new medium ) keep touch adolescent suicide attempter addition usual care , compare usual care , improve evolution depression 6 month Determine whether use SMS ( mail new medium ) keep touch adolescent suicide attempter addition usual care , compare usual care , improve evolution health-related quality life 6 month Determine delay recurrence suicide attempt 6 month end intervention send SMS ( mail new medium ) evaluate intervention effect recurrence stop Determine delay death suicide 6 month end intervention send SMS ( mail new medium ) evaluate intervention effect suicide stop Compare number callphone spend unit care adolescent group Media group Classic Participants Adolescent treat suicide attempt pediatric psychiatric unit participate hospital : Besançon , Dijon , Metz-Thionville , Nancy , Reims , Strasbourg , FRANCE . The SA define `` non-fatal act individual liberally cause self-injury ingests substance excess prescribe generally recognise therapeutic dosage '' ( 25 ) . All patient medical examination begin research . Adolescent recruit psychiatric evaluation within 24 hour admission pediatric unit participate hospital . Inclusion Criteria : To 13-17 year old To treat suicide attempt To write consent patient his/her parent participation research Non-inclusion Criteria : The parent or/and patient refuse wo n't able accept participate ( somatic understandability reason ) , Incarcerated patient Those without cell phone internet connexion new medium . Randomization The Zelen randomization use study ( 26-28 ) . In participate hospital , member research team screen adolescent suicide attempter adolescent suicide attempter meet eligibility criterion , his/her group study define randomization . This patient benefit usual care additional SMS ( group MEDIA ) usual care ( group CLASSIC ) . Then , member research inform adolescent 'psychiatrist present patient his/her parent design study , group patient . The psychiatrist also give information study gather `` informed consent '' . Intervention The intervention group MEDIA `` keep touch '' intervention send SMS ( mail new medium ) . The patient receive 6 SMS ( mail new medium ) 6 month SA . The first one 7 day SA last one 6 month . The first SMS ( mail new medium ) send soon SA study adult suicide attempter underline importance early start connectedness measure . The text message evolve time , adapt genre adolescent . The control arm represent group CLASSIC usual care . Outcome measure Primary outcome The primary outcome delay recurrence suicide attempt 6 month inclusion study . The recurrence date occurrence collect member research team participate hospital . Secondary outcomes The secondary outcome include evaluation evolution 6-month period SA adolescent ' social network use Multidimensional Scale Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS ) , evaluation evolution 6-month period SA adolescent health-related quality life use Kidscreen-27 VSP-A , evolution 6-month period SA adolescent ' depression use Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) . The score evolution compare group CLASSIC MEDIA . The delay recurrence suicide attempt 6 month end intervention send SMS ( mail new medium ) . The recurrence date occurrence collect member research team participate hospital . The delay death suicide 6 month end intervention . The suicide date occurrence collect member research team participate hospital . The number callphone spend unit care adolescent group Media group Classic . They note notebook plan purpose . Instruments The text message worked focus group peer adolescent . A pilot study also carry 2015 ( MEDIADO ) refine content . The text message change time . They personalize surname patient name psychiatrist his/her immediate superior meet patient SA . The number unit underlined message patient encourage call whenever he/she feel need specify someone always present him/her . The Multidimensional Scale Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS ) 12-item self-report 5 possible answer item . It assess perception social support family member , friend , significant others . It already use country ( 29-30 ) translate validated French team Toulouse ( 31 ) . The three subscales , address different source support , identify find strong factorial validity . The MSPSS also good internal test-retest reliability well moderate construct validity . High level perceive social support associate low level depression anxiety . The Kidscreen-27 27-item self-report develop European group ( 32 ) , validate 12 European country . It evaluate physical wellness , psychological wellness , relationships parent , social network , relationship friend , school . The internal consistency good discriminate power . The VSP-A 37-item self-report 10 dimension , validate French . This self-report good internal consistency construct validity content validity also good ( 33 ) . The CES-D 12-item self report good internal consistency , validate French . The baseline personal , familial social characteristic collect medical record order explore factor influence outcomes . Statistical analyse The primary analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis use data randomize participant , although per protocol analysis primary outcome also report . There adjust center . Continuous variable describe mean ( standard deviation ) median ( range ) , categorical variable number percentage , appropriate . The Chi-square Fisher exact test use analysis qualitative variable Student Mann-Whitney test quantitative variable . Differences primary secondary outcome two group study test independently .</detailed_description>
