	<brief_summary>In healthy individual , body responds glucose ( sugar ) ingestion reduce amount release liver . At time , skeletal muscle increase rate remove glucose bloodstream , via action hormone insulin . This ensure blood glucose level remain controlled range . However , developed country , diseases metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes become prevalent , due dietary modification reduction physical activity . As one prominent barrier regular physical activity lack time , find way maximize health benefit exercise priority researcher . The investigator want understand potential difference effect six week aerobic training , exercise perform either breakfast prolong fast . Specifically , research aim investigate whether difference change process implicate glucose regulation secondly , subsequent eat physical activity behavior . By investigate change work explore exercise nutrition optimize benefit health weight loss .</brief_summary>
