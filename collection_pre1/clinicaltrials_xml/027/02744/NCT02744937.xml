	<brief_summary>Objectives : To determine whether TRUS-guided prostate biopsy perform patient continue low-dose aspirin ( LDA ) associate great incidence , duration , severity bleeding complication . Eligibility : Men 40-year-old elevate serum prostate-speciﬁc antigen level and/or abnormal digital rectal examination ﬁndings candidate PB . Design trial Prospective Randomized Trial Study treatment : Continuing low-Dose aspirin transrectal prostate biopsy Primary endpoint : The incidence , duration , severity bleed complication Statistical analysis sample size estimation : Fisher 's exact test chi-square test use explore difference two group categorical variable , Student t-test use continuous variable . Under assumption difference 25 % bleeding complication group , α=0.05 power=0.80 , 60 subject need arm . Assuming drop-out rate 20 % , target recruit number 150 total .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) -guided prostate biopsy ( PB ) currently standard diagnose prostate cancer one commonly perform urologic procedure . The complication occur procedure extensively describe previously . Bleeding complication , namely hematuria , rectal bleeding , hematospermia , frequent , report incidence 20 % 70 % , almost exclusively self-limiting mild moderate severity . There increase number patient require PB antiplatelet medication simultaneously . This middle-age elderly patient receive long-term antithrombotic therapy mainly prevention cardiovascular event , patient form majority risk prostate cancer . As surgical intervention , aspirin typically discontinue 7 10 day PB . However , discontinue aspirin might increase risk cardiovascular event , continue aspirin PB might necessarily increase severe bleed complication . Several study find increase bleeding complication patient continue low-dose aspirin . However , study retrospective , one randomize . Moreover , prospective randomize trial East Asian patient , low risk thrombosis increase risk bleed antithrombotic treatment acute coronary syndrome white patient . The aim present randomize study determine whether TRUS-guided PB perform patient continue low-dose aspirin ( LDA ) associate great incidence , duration , severity bleeding complication .</detailed_description>
