	<detailed_description>The objective propose study evaluate molecular image direct , three-dimensional ( 3D ) ultrasound guide biopsy system human patient . Prior study show Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) /Computed Tomography ( CT ) image PET molecular imaging agent , FACBC ( synthetic amino acid ) , sensitive FDA-approved prostate specific membrane antigen single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) radiotracer prostate cancer detection . FACBC image show high focal uptake tumor focus normal prostate thus could ideal information direct target biopsy prostate . This target biopsy system unique feature PET/CT image register 3D ultrasound image , result , suspicious PET lesion superimpose real-time ultrasound data ; fuse image use direct biopsy needle tumor target . The hypothesis study PET/ultrasound fusion target biopsy detect cancer per core standard 12-core TRUS guide biopsy . The specific aim include : 1 . To perform PET/CT direct , 3D ultrasound-guided biopsy determine fusion target biopsy detect cancer 2D transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) -guided biopsy 2 . To develop workflow perform deformable registration fusion PET/CT 3D ultrasound image human patient Thirty six patient , suspicion recurrent prostate cancer definitive therapy radiotherapy , recruit study . At least half patient positive imaging finding undergo 2D TRUS-guided biopsy well PET/ultrasound fusion biopsy . The propose study first-in-human trial use PET/CT image direct 3D ultrasound-guided biopsy prostate . The multimodality image approach combine high sensitivity PET real-time information ultrasound improve cancer detection .</detailed_description>
