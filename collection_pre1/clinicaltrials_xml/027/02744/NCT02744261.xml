	<detailed_description>HIV prevention global public health priority . Providing efficacious prevention method great likelihood use profound impact public 's health . Critical use `` acceptability . '' However , current conceptualization adherence acceptability fail fully articulate account pattern use non-use . Formulation property critically important drug delivery user experience . Microbicide developers thus opportunity directly control formulation 's impact acceptability adherence product use , well biological product performance . Microbicide product develop achieve performance standard behavioral ( user experience ) biological ( efficacy ) function . By incorporate user experience early product development process , developer greatest chance provide at-risk individual best prevention method science provide . Developing prevention product use vagina and/or rectum optimize user experience compartment increase likelihood product use consistently correctly . The impact global public health potential far-reaching , decrease HIV sexually transmit infection ( STI ) incidence prevalence woman men . Methodology Data Collection : This formative mixed method design volunteer ( N~20-30 ; ~10-15 male ; ~10-15 female ) first prescreened basic study eligibility use brief questionnaire . Those interested study eligible base response prescreen complete STI/HIV screening pregnancy test ( female ) . During course study , participant evaluate 3 product : 2 distinct suppository formulation 1 gel formulation represent range rheological biophysical property potential microbicides design rectal/dual compartment use . Participants evaluate experience suppository use ( compare gel use ) context receptive anal intercourse ( RAI ) among male female , context vaginal intercourse ( VI ) ( female ) . Each participant randomly assign order evaluate 3 product . Participants require complete brief phone survey ( &lt; 3 minute ) every day , begin day start first product evaluation period continue complete final study visit ( approximately 10-20 week ) . The phone survey include short set question sexual behavior product use time since last phone survey ( 24 hour ) . After sexual encounter include RAI/VI study product use , participant require complete web survey experience study product . After participant evaluate three product , participant complete individual in-depth interview study staff experience study product .</detailed_description>
