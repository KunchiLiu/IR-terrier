	<brief_title>Immune Predictors Response Pembrolizumab Therapy Stage IV Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator collect 50 milliliter blood sample patient first cycle Pembrolizumab therapy . White blood cell separate accord cluster differentiation ( CD ) marker CD4+ , CD8+ , CD14+ population use magnetic bead . A portion cellular fraction stimulate lab lineage-specific agonist cocktail . Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) purify unstimulated stimulate cell population pre- post-therapy timepoints patient . Lineage-specific transcriptomes quantitated used derive gene expression profile comparison clinical phenotype .</detailed_description>

Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 criterion evaluate CT PET ( positron emission tomography ) /CT assessment tumor burden . 1 . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . 3 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . 4 . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 5 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 6 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 7 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 8 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 9 . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 10 . Has active infection require systemic therapy . 11 . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . 12 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 13 . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . 14 . Has receive prior therapy agent program cell death ( PD ) 1 ( i.e. , antiPD1 ) PD ligand ( PDL ) ( i.e. , antiPDL1 antiPDL2 ) . 15 . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . 16 . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . 17 . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .</criteria>
