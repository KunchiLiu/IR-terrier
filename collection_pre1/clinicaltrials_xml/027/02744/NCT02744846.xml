	<brief_summary>The objective propose study assess effect different type , timing , amount antibiotic use first two year life ( Specific Aim 1 ) body mass index ( BMI ) obesity age 5 10 year ( Specific Aim 2 ) growth trajectory age 5 year . In Specific Aim 3 , investigator address big effect antibiotic obesity within subgroup population , different racial/ethnic group whether child 's mother get antibiotic pregnant . The data study come electronic medical record 600,000 child 42 healthcare system within 10 Clinical Data Research Networks ( CDRNs ) across United States . The investigator get information antibiotic prescribing first two year life , `` virtually '' follow child age 5 10 year see BMIs , many obese clinical standard ( i.e. , body mass index exceed 95th percentile age sex ) . In main analysis , CDRNs send individual data central site . Rather , use sophisticated computer program , study 's coordinating center send `` question data , '' thus protect privacy patient ' healthcare system ' record . In analysis , check well `` distribute research network '' approach work , work individual record whose identify information strip ( `` de-identified data '' ) . In Secondary Aim , investigator employ focus group parent in-depth interview clinician explore best put finding everyday practice . Throughout study , addition employ privacy-protecting approach analyze share data , investigator adhere principle inclusion , patient-centeredness , stakeholder engagement , effective governance , protection human subject . At end two-year project , investigator propose avenue dissemination scientific finding product .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short- Long-Term Effects Antibiotics Childhood Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibiotics among valuable medical discovery . Recent research understand bacteria gut use energy , however , raise concern whether broad-spectrum antibiotic , over-prescribed mild infection , prescribe early infancy may cause obesity childhood . Obesity common serious condition among US child , particularly child disadvantage population . Past study examine link antibiotic use childhood obesity small lack diversity well modern scientific tool gauge extent prescribe antibiotic lead excess weight gain . PCORnet , National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network , comprise large network data electronic medical record , provide ideal test bed address question . Further , clear caregiver clinician use result earlier study decide antibiotic prescribe faced common infection like ear infection . Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate comparative effect different type , timing , amount antibiotic use first two year life body mass index risk obesity age 5 ( primary outcome age ) 10 ( secondary ) year . Hypothesis : There `` dose-response '' relationship number antibiotic course give first 2 year life high BMI probability obesity age 5 10 year . This relationship strong broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribe first 6 month life . Specific Aim 2 : To assess comparative effect different type , timing , amount antibiotic use first two year life rate pattern childhood growth first 5 year life . Hypothesis : There `` dose-response '' relationship number antibiotic course give first 2 year life subsequent growth trajectory child pattern increase child 's risk later overweight obesity . This relationship strong broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribe first 6 month life . Specific Aim 3 : To explore effect different type , timing , amount antibiotic childhood BMI , obesity risk growth ( Aims 1 2 ) vary accord patient socio-demographic , clinical , maternal characteristic , include : 1 ) socio-demographic ( Child sex , Child race/ethnicity , Geography , base location clinical facility ) ; 2 ) Clinical ( Prescription medication also cause obesity , esp . corticosteroid , Low birth weight macrosomia term infant ) ; 3 ) Maternal subset data partner list section B link maternal child record ( BMI , Maternal receipt antibiotic pregnancy , Type delivery , i.e. , Cesarean v. vaginal ) . Hypotheses : The antibiotic effect vary socio-demographic maternal characteristic . Long-term corticosteroid use potentiate effect antibiotic childhood obesity . Secondary Aim : Through focus group in-depth interview , explore parent caregiver provider assess information relate current future benefit risk , particularly treatment antibiotic early childhood , substantial near-term benefit along moderate long-term risk . The investigator also explore clinician , health care organization , policy maker best present study finding help parent understand strength limitation context share clinical decision-making .</detailed_description>
