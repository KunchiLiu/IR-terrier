	<detailed_description>Integrin αvβ3 important member integrin receptor family express preferentially activate endothelial cell angiogenesis type tumor cell , low quiescent vessel cell normal cell . Therefore , integrin αvβ3 receptor become valuable target diagnosis response evaluation malignant tumor . The tri-peptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) specifically bind integrin αvβ3 receptor . Accordingly , variety radiolabeled RGD-based peptide develop non-invasive imaging integrin αvβ3 expression via single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Among RGD radiotracers study , several RGD monomer investigate clinical trial , preliminary result demonstrate specific image various type tumor , tumor uptake correlate well level integrin αvβ3 expression . Recently , several RGD dimeric peptide PEG linkers study . The new type RGD peptides show much high vitro integrin αvβ3-binding affinity single RGD tri-peptide sequence , importantly , exhibit significantly increase tumor uptake improve vivo kinetics animal model . As representative , 99mTc-3PRGD2 could easily prepare exhibited excellent vivo behavior animal model . No adverse reaction observe animal model date . For interest clinical translation 99mTc-3PRGD2 , open-label SPECT/CT study design investigate safety diagnostic performance 99mTc-3PRGD2 esophagus cancer patient . A single dose nearly 11.1 MBq/kg body weight 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg 3PRGD2 ) intravenously inject esophagus cancer patient . Visual semiquantitative method use ass whole-body planar thoracic SPECT/CT image . Adverse event also observe patient .</detailed_description>
