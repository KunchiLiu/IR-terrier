	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn investigational imaging scan help researcher predict patient may respond treatment . The result investigational scan compare result standard digital mammogram ( DMs ) ultrasound ( US ) . The investigational imaging scan use study : - Tc99m Sestamibi Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) , - Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Molecular Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , follow study schedule study 2014-0185 . While study , receive type chemotherapy call anthracycline neoadjuvant therapy . The study doctor tell type chemotherapy receiving , well schedule give . In addition test procedure describe consent study 2014-0185 , DCE-MRIs MBI scan 3 different time point . These perform : - Before start anthracycline therapy - When finish receiving anthracycline therapy - When finish receiving neoadjuvant therapy Before DCE-MRI , give contrast injection vein . Each DCE-MRI take 45 minute hour total , perform like normal MRI . Before MBI scan , receive injection 99mTc sestamibi ( type drug give energy see special camera , like mammogram ) . You MBI scan 5 minute receive Tc99m sestamibi . During scan , breast position 2 detector lightly compress . The detector 2 square camera , look similar mammogram camera . You seat entire procedure scan take hour . During first part image study , MBI scan first 5-10 patient may 20 minute longer normal , MRI scan take 10 minute longer normal . These scan may take long study staff adjust machine study . If doctor think need check status disease ( part standard care ) , also digital mammography ultrasound 3 time point . You receive result mammography ultrasound . Information , image previous scan medical history , also collect medical record . The result DCE-MRI MBI scan affect change course treatment , include type surgery may . You treat physician receive result MBI DCE/MRI result use treatment planning . Length Study : You study long receive chemotherapy part Study 2014-0185 . If unable one investigational scan due intolerable side effect , take study early .</detailed_description>
