	<brief_title>The Reinforcing Value Added Sugars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite long-term emphasis reduce intake add sugar , behavioral change hard instill amongst population . Foods add sugar highly reinforce , , reduce consumption order adhere dietary guideline ( DGA ) may difficult maintain . Sugar produce effect similar drug abuse increase extracellular dopamine release nucleus accumbens shell result reinforce effect . Reducing reinforce behavior challenging , term food , know whether reinforce value food high add sugar increase access food reduce . If , would present mechanistic barrier meeting DGA make dietary change general . That reinforce value behavior ( e.g. , eat sugar ) increase rate behavior decrease strong theoretical underpinnings `` Disequilibrium Approach '' . This theory predict circumstance reinforcement create limited change baseline access . According Disequilibrium Approach , response deficit result increase reinforcement . Applied propose study , Disequilibrium Approach would predict lower consumption dietary add sugar would increase reinforce value food high add sugar . The Disequilibrium Approach accurately predict increase relative reinforce value ( RRV ) snack food among child . However , dietary change would need occur whole diet level adult child meet DGA reduce add sugar intake . It important know reduce added sugar whole-diet level result increase reinforce value food high add sugar .</detailed_description>
