	<brief_summary>Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) ; activate application adhesive system dentin cause degradation collagen proteins loss bond strength adhesive restoration . Caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( CAPE ) show inhibitory activity dentinal MMPs . It hypothesise dentin pretreatment CAPE , MMP inhibitor , would beneficial bond resin material tooth substrate course time . This study evaluate effect 5 % CAPE pretreatment microtensile bond strength nanohybrid resin restoration apply total-etch self-etch adhesive system 10 patient ( 12-18 yr ) . Two standard cavity ( 3 x 3 x 4 mm ) prepare occlusal surface one two premolar teeth patient randomly assign four treatment group ( n=10 ) ; 5 % CAPE pretreatment total-etch adhesive ( TC ) , Total-etch adhesive ( control ) ( T ) , 5 % CAPE pretreatment self-etch adhesive ( SC ) , Self-etch adhesive ( control ) ( S ) follow restoration 3 month intra-oral functioning . After teeth extraction , specimens store distilled water+thymol solution 4°C inhibit microbial growth use one week period . Dentin-composite stick obtain restoration µTBS test scan electron microscopy ( SEM ) evaluation . Failure mode analysis perform microscopically . Data analyse statistically use Repeated Measure ANOVA ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Dentin pretreatment CAPE solution ( 5 % ) 60 second significantly increase composite resin restoration ' bond strength dentin applied either total-etch self-etch adhesive system . Thus use MMP inhibitor prior resin restoration . However long term clinical study need support use CAPE pretreatment along self-etch total-etch adhesive system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim present study evaluate effect caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( CAPE ) pretreatment use matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) inhibitor microtensile bond strength ( µTBS ) nanohybrid resin restoration apply total-etch self-etch adhesive system . A total 10 patient age 12 18 year old ( 4 male , 6 female , mean age:15 ) receive 40 composite restoration . The patient contralateral pair caries-free premolar plan extracted orthodontic treatment enrol study . This study perform protocol approve Ethical Committee Clinical Studies , Faculty Medicine , University Ege , Izmir , Turkey ( 04.10.2012 ; no:12-8/6 ) . The treatment perform informed consent receive parent patient . Included teeth function anomaly find neither teeth occlusion . Two standard cavity ( 3 x 3 x 4 mm ) continuous enamel cavosurface margin prepare occlusal surface premolar tooth.Totally four cavity patient randomly assign four treatment group ( n=10 ) ; Group TC : CAPE total-etch adhesive ( Syntac ; Ivoclar Vivadent AG ) , Group T : Total-etch adhesive ( control ) , Group SC : CAPE self-etch adhesive ( AdheSE ; Ivoclar Vivadent AG ) , Group S : Self-etch adhesive ( control ) . All cavity restore incrementally nano-filled hybrid composite resin ( Tetric-N-Ceram , Ivoclar Vivadent AG ) polymerization layer perform 40 second light-curing unit ( BluePhase Ivoclar Vivadent AG ) exceed energy output 500mw/sec .</detailed_description>
