	<detailed_description>War-associated injury often result soft tissue bone contaminate foreign material , lead infection ( Fares et al . 2013 ; Covey , Lurate , Hatton 2000 ) . Wound infection remain great risk life restoration function war-wounded survive first hour ( Tong 1972 ; Murray 2008 ) . The Syrian arm conflict break 2011 quickly deteriorate . Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) run emergency trauma project Ministry Health hospital Ar Ramtha , Jordan , less five kilometer Syrian border . At facility patient Syrian arm conflict receive treatment blast- gunshot-injuries . Wounds treat accord International Committee Red Cross war surgery protocol ( Giannou Baldan 2010 ) . Wound management heal difficult time consuming , often complicate infection antibiotic resistance . Recommendations treatment war-associated infection generally support cohort study ( Murray et al . 2008 ) . High rate war wound infection cause antimicrobial drug resistant organism show Middle East report generally include combatant . Due use body armor forward medical therapy data may applicable civilian setting . Furthermore , available study either perform old wound ( Teicher et al . 2014 ) available culture sample , disregard infection sign ( Sutter et al . 2011 ; Dau , Tloba , Daw 2013 ) . Without clinical sign infection , routine collection peri-debridement culture sample inappropriate war-associated injury ( Murray et al . 2008 ) . The differentiation contamination infect organisms crucial order avoid unnecessary medication , especially limit use broad-spectrum antibiotic overuse may lead development multi-drug resistant organism ( Eardley et al . 2011 ) . Cultures collect acute wound clinical sign infection analyze .</detailed_description>
