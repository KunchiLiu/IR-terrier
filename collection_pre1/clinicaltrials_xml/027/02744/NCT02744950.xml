	<brief_summary>Surgical defect scalp require closure via various technique suture placement . A traditional technique require dermal ( deep ) epidermal ( superficial ) placement suture close defect ; referred intermediate complex linear repair . However , scalp location high tension , thus closure take hour longer perform . A type suture placement refer `` pulley stitch '' require placement stitch along defect . The pulley stitch use area high tension close large defect . The purpose study compare scar result time take perform scalp closure via pulley stitch via intermediate/complex linear repair . To knowledge , study perform compare two technique . Such study would useful demonstrate comparable scar appearance reduce time perform scalp closure .</brief_summary>
