	<brief_summary>Endodrill new instrument biopsy sample GI-channel . The purpose study follow : - Compare EUS-guided Endodrill biopsy endoscopic ultrasound guide fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) term ability establish correct diagnosis submucosal tumor upper GI tract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EUS-Endodrill vs. EUS-FNA Diagnosis Submucosal Tumors Upper GI Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endodrill newly construct biopsy tool flexible endoscopic use . It use drill motion within case harvest solid biopsy tissue biopsy channel conventional flexible endoscope . It originally design sample tissue submucosal lesion . The investigator first study instrument finish . Endodrill safe use generates submucosal tissue compare biopsy conventional biopsy forceps . In study investigator want compare Endodrill instrument FNA ( modality EUS-guided ) term ability obtain correct diagnosis submucosal tumor upper GI-tract . Patients diagnose suspected submucosal tumor upper GI-tract enrol study . They first go examination EUS . If suspicion submucosal tumor confirm , investigator perform EUS guide FNA Endodrill biopsies patient.The harvest tissue evaluate senior pathologist clarify method generates correct diagnosis .</detailed_description>
