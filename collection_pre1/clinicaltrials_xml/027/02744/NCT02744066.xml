	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Patient Tolerance Nursing Ease-of-Use Novel Hearing Protection Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite best effort Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) caregiver , vulnerable fragile NICU patient frequently expose noxious level noise monitor respiratory equipment alarm , well routine NICU care practice . Particularly detrimental sleep auditory development patient exposure high frequency noise specifically design alert NICU caregiver important change patient status . This pilot study help evaluate fit , ergonomic design ease-of-use novel hearing protection system ( special ear-muffs along unique attachment mechanism ) specifically design top diminish transmission high frequency noise patient within NICU , allow transmission low frequency sound , mother 's voice .</detailed_description>
