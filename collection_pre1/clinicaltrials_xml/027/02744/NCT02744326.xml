	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct prospective study randomize control trial ( RCT ) involve child adolescent present primary mental health ( MH ) concern emergency department ( EDs ) Children 's Hospitals Clinics Minnesota ( CH ) . The investigator characterize primary MH concern 800 patient assess baseline access utilization external resource . All enrol patient follow 3-months initial visit determine ED revisit identify factor associate connection outpatient care . The RCT portion study involve 200 patient discharge ED referral outpatient MH provider , test novel text-message communication method parents/caregivers encourage complete follow-up care child . The experimental group receive tailor text message reminder regard follow-up appointment . Relevance : Pediatric ED visit MH issue increase , current system manage patient optimal . More information need accelerate change efficiently invest improve service available MH patient . Specifically , information need MH population need target , simple , reproducible intervention improve connection community resource . The propose study collect vital information need develop program improve outcomes reduce ED revisits pediatric patient visit EDs CH primary MH concern , set stage future work focus improve core outcome MH youth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Youth Visiting ED With Mental Health Issues : Pilot Text Based Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Significance The number youth visit ED MH issue rise dramatically last decade.1 EDs become safety net strain mental health system resourced lack adequate service meet demand impatient outpatient level.2 EDs bear high burden care child adolescent acute psychiatric illness , pediatric patient MH-related visit require substantial ED resources.2,3 Visits ED MH longer , likely triaged urgent evaluation result admission transfer compare visit reasons.4,5 ED revisits also also common pediatric MH patient , recent study find return rate 6-9 % within 72 hour , return rate around 30 % 4-year study period.6 ED visit child adolescent MH concern resource intensive , research crucial improve management patients.2,3 Information lacking resource need MH diagnostic subgroup : MH issue encounter ED physician cover broad range diagnosis . Bardach et al . examine MH hospitalization identify follow common diagnostic subgroup : depression , bipolar disorder , psychosis , externalize disorder , anxiety disorder , ADHD , eat disorder , substance abuse , reaction disorder autism.7 ED visit MH concern often think mainly involve suicide attempt , self-harm behavior psychosis , recent study large urban pediatric ED find almost half visit behavioral problems.8 Preliminary data describe almost half behavioral assessment do CH 2013 individual developmental disorder ( i.e . autism spectrum disorder ) . The number MH ED visit behavioral issue grow , limited information regard population.8 Overall , ED experience well document base upon diagnostic subgroup , critical difference MH patient depend primary concern , specifically connection outpatient resource risk ED revisit.8,9 In order efficiently help MH youth crucial obtain information regard service , differs diagnostic subgroup.8 Text-messaging improve MH referral follow-up : The ED represent suboptimal care set MH youth provide important opportunity identify child adolescent crisis connect external resources.8 Unfortunately , successful follow-up MH resource ED patient show low , study find follow-up rate 30 % .10,11 A recent study find 66 % patient visit ED suicidal behavior successfully follow mental health provider , positive number , one still show large need improvement.12 Strategies need improve successful follow-up MH outpatient referral failure comply ED discharge guideline could result worsen symptom return visit ED . While ED provider unique opportunity identify MH youth provide referral , also limited time resource . If intervention incorporate usual care ED , must simple , efficient , easy replicate . Automated text message reminder show increase attendance healthcare appointments.13 Over 90 % Americans report own cell phone 2013 , 81 % report use cell phone send receive text messages.14 In addition , cost personnel requirement need implement automate text message base system low , make unique intervention technique could easily incorporate usual care ED.15 A recent study find automate text message appointment reminder improve follow-up attendance primary specialty care adult ED patients.15 Additional research need examine potential text message strategy increase attendance follow-up appointment diverse population youth visit ED MH concern . Conclusion : The overall goal propose study collect vital information need develop program improve outcomes reduce revisits child adolescent present ED primary MH concern . Pediatric ED visit MH issue increasing.1 The current system need improvement , yet information need accelerate change , include information MH population need target , simple , reproducible intervention improve connection community resource . The propose project collect data cohort MH patient two large urban EDs characterize diagnostic subgroup current access care , follow patient 3-months post visit identify risk factor ED revisit barrier outpatient care , test novel text message reminder system focus improve linkage MH patient follow-up referral . The EDs CH provide vast majority emergent pediatric care within Twin City Metro area , substantial proportion visit mental health relate . The propose project provide unique opportunity meet study goal , set stage future work focus improve care outcome MH youth . Research Question 1 . Which pediatric MH patient visit ED CH need additional support ( low baseline access utilization outpatient care , high risk ED revisit , low follow-up outpatient referral ) ? 2 . Does target text-message communication method improve compliance ED discharge pediatric MH patient ? Specific Aims Hypotheses 1 . Characterize primary MH concern child adolescent visit EDs CH assess baseline access utilization external MH resource . Hypothesis : MH patient represent several subgroup primary concern subgroup differ baseline connection utilization community resource . 2 . Follow enrol MH patient post visit determine factor associate ED revisit barrier outpatient care . Hypothesis : Patients public insurance , visit ED self-inflicted injury , identify multiple barrier connect outpatient MH care higher rate ED revisits . 3 . Develop test novel text-message communication method focus increase rate discharge referral follow-up ED patient MH concern . Hypothesis : Patients randomize text-message communication system high rate follow-up care lower rate ED revisit compare patient receive usual care</detailed_description>
