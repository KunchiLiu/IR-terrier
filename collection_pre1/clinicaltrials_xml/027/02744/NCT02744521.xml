	<brief_title>Training Inmate Peer Educators Detecting Tuberculosis Developing Country Prison : A Cluster Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background justification Although global incidence tuberculosis ( TB ) fall average rate 1.5 % per year year 2000 2013 , TB remain major global health problem second lead cause death infectious disease [ 1,2 ] . An estimated 9 million people develop TB year 2013 one-quarter Africa , continent also high rate case death relative population [ 1,3 ] . In year , 5.7 million case detect notified National TB program ( NTPs ) , mean 3 million people `` miss '' TB control program [ 1 ] . The TB case detection rate ( calculate notification new relapse case divide estimate incidence per year ) 64 % global level World Health Organization ( WHO ) target ( 70 % ) [ 1 ] . Tuberculosis disproportionately affect vulnerable population prisoner . According review study high low-income country , prevalence TB prison 3 200-fold high general population [ 4,5 ] . A number factor overcrowd , inadequate ventilation , delayed case detection movement prisoner site site make prison high-risk environment TB transmission [ 6 ] . The emergence drug-resistant TB also make TB control effort complicate prison . [ 7 ] . If untreated , prisoner drug-resistant TB additional health hazard fellow prisoner staff [ 8 ] . Furthermore , TB resistant form TB spill community create public health hazard [ 9 ] . In sub-Saharan African prison , high burden human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection poverty make problem much bad [ 10 ] . Health care service also limit due lack diagnostic facility many TB patient remain undetected [ 11 ] . In recent study South African prison , example , prevalence undiagnosed TB report high 3.5 % [ 12 ] . Ethiopia , rank 8th 22 country high burden TB [ 13 ] , implement directly observe treatment short-course ( DOTS ) program since 1992 [ 14 ] . Currently , country achieve Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) halve TB incidence , prevalence , mortality 2015 [ 1 ] . However , case detection rate ( CDR ) remain low many develop country . The case detection rate form TB report 62 % still WHO target [ 1 ] . Ethiopia list among top ten country account 74 % ( 2.4 % million ) miss TB case [ 1 ] . Shortage health worker , low service coverage , low health seek behavior lack efficient TB diagnostics factor low case detection rate country [ 15 ] . Tuberculosis detection huge challenge Ethiopian prison [ 7,16 ] . Because lack skilled health professional laboratory facility , TB diagnosis rely referral prisoner health facility outside prison . As prisoner often recognize symptom TB use non-TB medicine relieve symptom , TB diagnosis often severely late [ 17,18 ] . As consequence , many prisoner TB Ethiopian prison remain undiagnosed [ 19 ] . Recently , report least half symptomatic pulmonary TB case leave undiagnosed hence untreated Northern Ethiopian prison [ 20 ] . Some patient remain undiagnosed two year [ 20 ] . This create opportunity transmission dissemination TB among prisoner also general community . In addition , although accurate data available TB treatment adherence , condition Ethiopian prison make TB treatment supervision difficult hence adherence full course anti-TB drug remain challenge TB patient [ 20 ] . This lead emergence drug-resistant strain , important challenge TB control . Thus , effort need improve TB case detection treatment adherence Ethiopian prison . Epidemiological model show employ active case find entry exit screening , frequent mass screening , use combination diagnostic tool ( usually sputum smear microscopy chest-X-ray ) , improve TB case detection prison [ 21 ] . However , resource constraint lack skilled health professional limit applicability prison poor country . Increasing health service coverage train health worker fill gap short period seem remote possibility . Therefore , need find alternative way could increase access diagnostic treatment service , ultimately increase TB case detection treatment success rate . In current study , investigator plan undertake cluster randomize control trial ass whether empower involve inmate peer educator TB control improve TB case detection , treatment success rate , pre-treatment symptom duration resource-limited prison set . 2 . Hypotheses Hypothesis 1 : Case detection rate : Compared control sit , TB case detection rate intervention site increase 50 % . Hypothesis 2 : Treatment success rate : Compared control sit , treatment success rate intervention site increase 10 % . Hypothesis 3 : Pre-treatment symptom duration : Compared control sit , proportion patient pre-treatment symptom duration &gt; =3 month reduce 30 % intervention site . 3 . Methods 3.1 . Study area study population This study conduct Northern Ethiopian prison . Ethiopia officially register prison population 112,361 ( 136/100,000 person ) 2010 [ 22 ] , high imprisonment rate observe sub-Saharan African country Kenya ( 121/100,000 person ) , Malawi ( 76/100,000 person ) . The fact prison overcrowd inadequately ventilate mean Ethiopian prison ideal transmission Mycobacterium tuberculosis [ 23 ] urge appropriate intervention . This interventional study conduct 16 main prison ( 8 match pair ) locate Amhara Tigray region include Mekelle vs. Shire , Adawa vs. Tembien , Humera vs. Adigrat , Mychew vs. Alamata , Wukro v Axum , Dessie vs. Woldya , Fenoteselam vs. Debremarkos , Debretabor vs. Bahir Dar one year period March 2016 March 2017 . This interventional study focus prison Northern Ethiopia consider feasibility . All prisoner 16 select prison study population . 3.2 . Study design inclusion criterion This match cluster randomize control trial randomization intervention treatment group carry within pair . Prisons match pairs basis location and/or number prisoner . Larger prison site locate main city Amhara Tigray region consider eligible small jail exclude . Accordingly , total 22 main prison ( 11 match pair ) eligible study five match pair Tigray remain Amhara region . All five matched prison pair Tigray include randomization consider proximity hence feasibility . However , investigator undertake random selection include three matched pair Amhara region consider feasibility financial constraint . 3.3 . Randomization Once required number match prison pair fix , randomization do within pair eight prison pair randomly assign intervention remain control group . One investigator Maastricht University n't information study prison perform randomization consult online randomization website ; random.org . The investigator undertake follow-up monitoring year ( March 2016 April 2017 ) outcomes measured 3.3.1 . Procedure After investigator discussion agreement concerned body Amhara Tigray region , eligible prison select accord inclusion criterion . Then investigator match select prison pair consider geographical location and/or number prisoner describe . After number require matched pair fix , randomization do intervention control group . 3.4 . Interventions 3.4.1 . Training inmate peer educator Before launch intervention program , investigator discuss objective procedure program prison administrator , prison health personnel , prisoner . Inmate peer educator , 3-6 prison , recruit consultation prison health personnel . The investigator , collaboration prison health personnel , provide 3 day train inmate peer educator use standard TB training material . The training focus basic fact TB : cause , transmission , symptom , diagnosis , prevention , treatment , outcomes . Inmate peer educator train provide health education TB , screen identify presumptive TB case , support TB patient adhere TB treatment . Moreover , inmate peer educator provide leaflet poster illustrate cause , transmission , main symptom TB , contain information TB curable proper treatment . Inmate peer educator also inform teach encourage fellow inmates isolation TB patient much setting allows . 3.4.2 . Educating prisoner perform TB screening After training , train prison peer educator start activity , investigator assess whether inmate peer educator really capable expect activity . The investigator make teach sample trainee front trainer evaluate inmate peer educator use checklist . Inmate peer educator also test whether cable identify presumptive TB case provide presumptive TB case non-presumptive TB case verify diagnosis TB expert ( trainer ) . Once tested capability , peer educator organize inmate group provide education TB , prevention , control every two week regular basis one year . Peer educator undertake routine TB screen use standardized TB screen protocol identify presumptive TB case referral . Inmate peer educator provide N95 mask use screen . Identified presumptive TB case ( , least , cough two week accord recommendation national TB guideline ) refer prison health personnel nearby hospital . 3.4.3 . Tuberculosis treatment follow-up Trained inmate peer educator follow encourage fellow patient adhere prescribe TB treatment undertake follow-up sputum examination accord national recommendation . Inmate peer educator provide health education consequence nonadherence TB treatment use prepared TB training module . 3.5 . Control Conditions At control site , involvement inmate peer educator train provide . The TB screen treatment activity follow exist referral system ( self-referral nearby hospital ) . However , prison personnel sit informed propose intervention . The prison personnel inform trial investigator n't know whether intervention effective . The investigator also inform prison personnel prison sit select chance intervention implement control prison investigator find trial effective helpful . Moreover , investigator provide standardize up-to-date referral protocol prison personnel control sit intervention site . 3.6 . Follow-up monitoring Supervisors assign intervention site ( prison ) regularly follow intervention progress , daily assessment activity give timely solution problem meet . The principal investigator also supervise activity closely regular visit phone call . Randomly select prisoner intervention site ask short random question check whether get intervention random time intervention . An intervention check also do collect data knowledge attitude practice ( KAP ) prisoner intervention site use standardized pre-tested KAP questionnaire face-to-face interview train prison nurse . Inmate peer educator involve facilitate interview baseline data , post-test perform trained nurse . Briefly , KAP questionnaire consist question etiology TB , mode transmission , prevention attitude prisoner whether afraid get infect TB bacillus . A sample prisoner select randomly proportional allocation total number prisoner intervention site data KAP score assess baseline end intervention ( 12 month ) . Only prisoner available prison intervention period eligible random selection . Finally , data also collect randomly select prisoner control sit KAP score two group compare . Supervisors also assign control site . They neither encourage discourage exist TB diagnosis treatment program site . But , supervisor regularly follow ongoing activity equal frequency intervention site . The principal investigator also supervise activity closely regular visit phone call . 3.6.1 . Contamination check Together supervisor , principal investigator undertake random assessment control sit regularly every week throughout intervention period check whether sort new TB control method peer education start control sit intervention site . Then , investigator give timely solution possible consider contamination result interpretation . 3.7 . Blinding Neither prison health personnel peer educator blind allocation . However , data analyzer laboratory personnel blind . 3.8 . Demographic clinical data collection Demographic clinical information pre-treatment symptom duration collect TB confirm case detect intervention control sit use pre-tested structured questionnaire . Patients ' sputum smear status , radiological finding treatment outcomes record referral site Directly Observed Treatment Short Course ( DOTS ) center group . The investigator also collect data size prison cell number pulmonary TB case detect previous two year start intervention intervention control sit consider possible adjustment . 3.9 . Laboratory Methods Diagnostic criterion For intervention control condition , TB diagnosis carry referral site use direct smear microscopy and/or chest X-ray ( routine available diagnostic method ) . Three sputum sample ( spot-morning-spot ) collect presumptive TB case direct sputum microscopy perform use Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique per national guideline referral site experience laboratory technologist . Chest X-ray also perform referral site . A presumptive TB case one initial sputum smear examination ( direct smear microscopy ) AFB-positive ; one sputum examination AFB-positive plus radiographic abnormality consistent active pulmonary TB determine clinician consider smear-positive TB case accord national guideline [ 24 ] . A patient symptom suggestive TB least 3 initial smear examination negative AFB direct microscopy , response course broad-spectrum antibiotic , radiological abnormality consistent pulmonary tuberculosis consider smear-negative pulmonary TB case [ 24 ] . All confirm TB case treat accord national guideline . The treatment regimen new TB case consist two month intensive phase treatment ethambutol , rifampicin , isoniazid pyrazinamide follow continuation phase treatment 4 month isoniazid rifampicin . Follow-up sputum examination conduct accord national recommendation outcome ( treatment success , failure , default , death ) record data collector ( trained prison nurse ) . A smear-positive TB patient least two negative smear include last month treatment report cured . A patient finish treatment smear result last month treatment least one previous occasion report treatment complete . If patient remain become smear-positive end 5 month later , he/she report treatment failure . A patient miss treatment eight consecutive week receive treatment least 4 week report defaulter . A patient transfer another record reporting unit receive treatment least 4 week whose treatment outcome report refer district report transfer . A patient die treatment report dead irrespective cause death [ 25 ] . 3.10 . Sample size calculation The number pair-matched cluster require study determine use formula suggest RJ Hayes S Bennett [ 26 ] pair-matched cluster randomize trial unequal cluster size show . The sample size calculate base follow assumption : estimate average annual pulmonary TB case detection rate ( CDR ) 40 % study prison ( estimate use unpublished review two year DOTs record study prison ) , expect detect 50 % increment case detection rate intervention period ( 40 % control group 60 % intervention group ) , power 80 % , coefficient variation 0.25 , significance level 0.05 . The number cluster fix consider primary outcome ( case detection rate ) . A coefficient variation 0.25 consider since full data match prison pair calculate exact value . C = 2+ ( Zα/2 + ZB ) 2 [ X0 x Av ( 1/X0j ) + X1 x Av ( 1/X1j ) + K2 ( X02 + X12 ) ] / ( X0-X1 ) 2 Where : C = number match cluster Zα/2 = level significance , 95 % = 1.96 Zβ = power study , 80 % = 0.84 X0 = estimate average annual smear-positive case detection rate control sit = 40 % X1 = estimate average annual smear-positive case detection rate intervention sit = 60 % K= coefficient variation = 0.25 Av ( 1/X0j ) = mean reciprocal cluster size ( person-years ) control group = 0.001 Av ( 1/X1j ) = mean reciprocal cluster size ( person-years ) intervention group = 0.0014 This computation provide cluster size 8.6 pair . Considering feasibility , investigator choose 8 pair . 3.11 . Study variables 3.11.1 . Outcome variables The primary outcome measure study case detection rate treatment outcome ( success , failure , death ) pre-treatment symptom duration secondary outcomes interest . Moreover , investigator also compare KAP score two group end intervention . Case detection rate ( CDR ) : Calculated notification new relapse case divide estimate incidence per year . The mean CDR compare within pair end intervention ( 12 month ) . Treatment success rate ( TSR ) : Cure treatment completion rate calculate number patient cure treatment complete divided total number patient report expressed percentage . Treatment success rate sum cure treatment completion rate . Pre-treatment symptom duration : Measured proportion patient pre-treatment symptom duration &gt; =3 month vs. &lt; 3 month . 3.11.2 . Predictor variables - The presence/absence intervention - Socio-demographic characteristic ( age , sex ) - Seasonal variation ( spring , winter , autumn , summer ) 3.12 . Operational definition Jail : A facility use temporarily detain suspected convict crime . Inmate/prisoner : Somebody confine prison punishment crime wait stand trial . Peer education : The teach share health information , value , behavior educate others may share similar social background life experience . Prison : A facility hold convict commit crime legal system deem especially serious long term sentence . 3.13 . Plan Analysis Collected data questionnaire laboratory analysis check completeness entry database . The data enter use Epi Data entry version 3.1 software . Frequency analysis run look range value , identify miss data possibly miscoded data . Then use SPSS 20.0 Windows analysis recommend cluster level analysis ( matched analysis ) . Considering prison unit analysis , mean CDR , TSR percentage patient symptomatic &gt; 3 month compare within pair use paired t-test sign test appropriate . The investigator also perform analysis date see trend outcome measure intervention period . 3.14 . Quality assurance methods The questionnaire pre-tested ensure reliability validity . Inmate peer educator thoroughly train TB screen procedure treatment supervision . The supervisor assign prison alone , principal investigator , supervise activity , rapid assessment general activity , give timely solution problem meet . Experienced laboratory professional involve microscopic examination quality control slide examine ensured regional laboratory region . 3.15 . Ethical Consideration Ethical clearance take Ethical Review Committees Mekelle University . A write co-operating letter take prison- administrator region . The participant include study provide write informed consent . Patients confirm tuberculosis refer get treatment . The confidentiality paper-based electronic patient data also safeguard throughout research activity even research complete . 3.16 . Dissemination result Once analyzed write , finding study submit Mekelle University , Maastricht University , Federal Ministry Health potential partner . Moreover , key finding study present scientific meeting conference lobby reformulation national TB control policy necessary attention give setting . The write manuscript also submit peer-reviewed journal publication . 4 . Trail registration The protocol clinical trial register Clinicaltrials.gov website .</detailed_description>
