	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ibrutinib brentuximab vedotin work treat patient Hodgkin lymphoma return ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , brentuximab vedotin , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving ibrutinib together brentuximab vedotin may better treatment Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Brentuximab Vedotin Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate anti-tumor activity two agent combination ibrutinib brentuximab vedotin , assess complete response ( CR ) rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability two agent combination evaluation toxicity , include type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . II . Obtain estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) , response duration survival ( overall progression-free ) . III . Describe outcomes patient ultimately undergo autologous allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation follow treatment ibrutinib/brentuximab vedotin . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collect deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) /ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) lymphoma specimens serial plasma sample future biomarker evaluation . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
