	<brief_summary>Rationale : Recent investigation suggest , certain concentration/meditation technique , possible modulate autonomic activity . The result recent randomize controlled trial investigate `` Wim Hof Method '' show direct biological effect in-vivo cytokine production strongly encouraging clinical evaluation technique 's efficacy immune-mediated inflammatory disease . Objective : To investigate whether add-on mindset &amp; physical therapy program base `` Wim Hof Method '' safely efficaciously applied patient active axial spondyloarthritis . Study design : Prospective open-label randomize controlled trial , safety efficacy . Study population : Twenty-four patient active axial spondyloarthritis 18 45 year age . Intervention : A 30-day training program add-on mindset physical therapy axial spondyloarthritis , use methodology design instructed Wim Hof . It involve breathe technique , train mindset concentration , gradual cold exposure . Main study parameters/endpoints : Safety evaluation program primary aim study . Secondary endpoint modulation serum CRP level . Exploratory objectives include modulation clinical disease activity ( ASDAS ) , quality life ( SF-36 , EQ-5D ) , depressive symptom ( HADS ) , predictive role generalize specific outcome expectancy ( EPQ-N , LOT-R , VAS scale ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Add-on Therapy Axial Spondyloarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Axial spondyloarthritis ( axSpA ) common systemic autoinflammatory disease affect approximately 7 1.000 individual . Recent investigation suggest , certain concentration/meditation technique , possible modulate autonomic activity . The endotoxemia experiment individual ( name Wim Hof ) use self-created concentration/meditation technique strongly supportive finding . The use technique - include breathe technique , train mindset concentration , gradual cold exposure - seem evoke control stress response . This response characterize sympathetic nervous system activation subsequent catecholamine/cortisol release , seem attenuate innate immune response . The remarkable result study individual lead randomise control trial technique Radboud UMC . Twenty-four healthy individual randomise receive instruction course technique instruction subsequently underwent endotoxemia experiment . The experiment involve intravenous administration low dos lipopolysaccharide measure in-vivo cytokine response clinical symptom . The result study show direct biological effect in-vivo cytokine production strongly encouraging evaluation technique 's efficacy clinical practice . The technique Wim Hof Method modulate scientifically reproducible mindset &amp; physical training program add-on therapy axSpA . Specifically , adjust potential functional limitation axSpA . Primary Objective : To investigate whether add-on mindset &amp; physical therapy program safely apply patient active axSpA use clinical safety parameter . Secondary Objective : To assess whether add-on mindset &amp; physical therapy program modulate objective sign inflammation patient active axSpA use serum biomarkers ( e.g . CRP ) . Exploratory objective : To assess whether add-on mindset &amp; physical therapy program influence Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score , quality life , depressive symptom ( HADS ) , explore predictive role generalize specific outcome expectancy patient active axSpA</detailed_description>
