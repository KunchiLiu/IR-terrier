	<brief_summary>The overall objective determine influence time ART initiation alcohol consumption HIV disease course , include detailed analysis important event occur shortly HIV acquisition . ART initiation immediately HIV infection ( Fiebig stag I-II ) largely result small HIV reservoir low HIV-associated systemic inflammation , link non-AIDS morbidity mortality . Immediate ART also reduce HIV-associated bacterial translocation may prevent dysbiosis , alteration intestinal microbiota link increased systemic inflammation . Immediate intervention , however , generally feasible information require consequence start ART later time-points , still early acquisition . The propose study conduct Lima , Peru , cohort 180 MSM acute ( Ab- , HIV RNA+ ) recent ( ≤ 3 month ) HIV infection . Alcohol use disorder present ~50 % HIV-infected MSM cohort , four time higher see among male general Peruvian population . Although role alcohol use HIV pathogenesis disease course remain unclear , study show correlation accelerate disease progression . In animal model clinical study , acute chronic alcohol consumption link bacterial translocation activation innate immune system , lead increase pro-inflammatory cytokine . The effect alcohol resemble early post-infection change bacterial translocation pro-inflammatory cytokine induce HIV impact HIV disease course ART initiation remain unexplored . Specific Aim 1 : To determine relative long-term benefit immediate vs. early vs. delay ART initiation . The investigator study outcomes 1.5 3.5 year MSM diagnose acute recent HIV infection . The investigator examine outcomes 3 group base time ART initiation : ) immediate : FI-II ( N~30 ) , b ) early : FIII-V ( N~50 ) c ) delay : 24 week diagnosis ( N~80 ) . The investigator anticipate CD4+ T cell count peripheral inflammatory marker FIII-V group delay group approach immediate treatment group ( FI-II ) time ; contrast , expect start ART `` early '' `` delay '' time point persistent change GI microbiome HIV reservoir . Specific Aim 2 : To determine impact alcohol use relative long-term benefit immediate vs. early vs. delay initiation ART . The investigator examine impact alcohol use critical event HIV infection . They hypothesize dose-dependent alcohol-induced change compound negative effect HIV lead great level dysbiosis inflammation , high early plasma HIV RNA , great `` seed '' persistence HIV DNA participant high-level alcohol use . The investigator assess viral load , GI microbiome metagenomics , pro-inflammatory cytokine , production msRNA analyze impact alcohol use subject prior ART initiation among ART-adherent participant persistent viral suppression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulating Impact Critical Events Early HIV Infection : Effect ART Initiation Alcohol Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Recent study suggest early initiation ART ( prior seroconversion ) prevent establishment HIV reservoir , eventually expand ART discontinue ( 1 , 2 ) . Early ART initiation , however , associate preservation CD4+ T cell low level total HIV DNA cell-associated RNA ( 3 ) well preservation gut Th17 cell , thereby avert major driver HIV-related immune activation limit size HIV reservoir ( 4 ) . When , contrast , ART initiate Fiebig III ( FIII ) later , many HIV-associated change already occur , include seed HIV reservoir , damage GI mucosa , initiation inflammatory cascade ( 4 ) . Some effect may relate development dysbiosis ( markedly different composition gut microbiota might drive continued inflammation ) . Since ART initiation within week HIV acquisition viable public health strategy , important completely understand relative long-term benefit initiate ART early time infection ( FI-II ) oppose short ( FIII-V ) long delay ( 24 week ) . The effect alcohol microbial translocation pro-inflammatory cytokine unlike early change HIV infection ( 5-7 ) ; however , alcohol 's role HIV pathogenesis progression well define . Since possibility high-level alcohol use mitigate benefit early ART emerge potentially important public health issue , investigator evaluate impact time ART initiation well alcohol use HIV pathogenesis Peruvian men sex men ( MSM ) , high-level alcohol use common . They study outcomes 1.5 3.5 year MSM diagnose acute ( Ab- , HIV RNA+ ) recent ( ≤3 month ) HIV infection . Three group base time ART initiation study : ) immediate : FI-II ( N~30 ) , b ) early : FIII-V ( N~50 ) c ) delay : 24 week diagnosis ( N~80 ) . The overarching hypothesis : 1 . Initiation ART soon HIV infection dampen perturbation GI microbiota , reduce HIV-induced inflammatory change , decrease seed reservoir . Initiation ART FI-II great benefit . The investigator anticipate CD4 count peripheral inflammatory marker FIII-V group group treat 24 week approach FI-II group 1.5 3.5 year ; contrast , investigator expect change GI microbiome HIV reservoir time modest . 2 . Irrespective time ART initiation , alcohol use compound negative effect HIV generate great level dysbiosis , microbial translocation , up-regulation inflammatory pathway , seed HIV reservoir . To investigate hypothesis , address follow two specific aim : SPECIFIC AIM 1 ) To determine relative long-term benefit immediate vs. early vs. delay initiation ART . Initiation ART Fiebig I-II , theoretically appeal , infeasible clinical practice duration FI-II short ( 10 day ) antibody-based test , use almost world-wide , unable diagnose FI-II . Six month ART initiate shortly seroconversion ( FIII ) improve many immune parameter , although near normal level see ART initiated FI-II ( 4 ) . Longer-term follow-up seropositive participant start ART ~2-8 month HIV acquisition compare initiating ART FI-II need see whether marker inflammation residual viral load might continue improve 6 month , decrease difference group . Methods : investigator evaluate 3 group use specimens equivalent time ART initiation total 3.5 year ART , compare CD4 count , time reach undetectable VL , GI microbiota , inflammatory marker . The size replication-competent reservoir PBMCs compare use measurement multiply splice viral RNA ( msRNA ) degree low-level infection new cell assess production circular viral DNA ( 2LTR HIV DNA ) . They model size persistence viral reservoir across ART-compliant study subject . In subset individual group , proviral integration site define ART initiation 1.5 3.5 year assess maintenance reservoir proliferate CD4 cell . SPECIFIC AIM 2 ) To determine impact high-level alcohol use relative long-term benefit immediate vs. early vs. delay ART initiation . High-level alcohol use result change GI microbiome , increase dysbiosis gut permeability , change associate up-regulation inflammatory pathway ( 8-13 ) . Dysbiosis present many HIV-infected patient . The extent dysbiosis correlate establish marker HIV disease progression consequent inflammatory process contribute HIV disease progression , even treated individual . Methods : The investigator use monthly data alcohol use ass alcohol consumption continuous , time-varying predictor . In participant time diagnosis , multiple timepoints prior ART enrol defer group , ass VL , GI microbiota metagenomics , pro-inflammatory cytokine , production msRNA . They compare factor subject report alcohol use , focus event occur shortly HIV acquisition . Specimens uninfected chronically infected subject available control . Finally , among ART-adherent subject persistent viral suppression , investigator assess inflammatory marker HIV reservoir without high-level alcohol use 1.5 3.5 year ART initiation .</detailed_description>
