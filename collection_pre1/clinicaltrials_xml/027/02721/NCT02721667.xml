	<brief_summary>Hypertension affect 70 % Canadians age 65y . Seniors hypertension high risk cardiovascular disease death . Most risk mediate high blood pressure ( BP ) . However , senior also risk side effect BP lower medication . These life threaten costly . Therefore , BP monitoring required ensure BP level recommend range ( neither high low ) . Home BP monitoring use ensure BP right range recommend patient high BP . Studies health care system show , optimally perform home monitoring , reading teletransmitted ( electronically send care provider ) . Additional study indicate BP control improve health care provider ( usually pharmacists nurse ) specifically assign review teletransmitted BP reading , use protocol , make therapeutic adjustment . However , study need conduct within Canadian healthcare system prove telemonitoring±case management cost-effective . In addition , proof senior consider telemonitoring usable acceptable require . The investigator conduct 200 patient randomize trial community-dwelling senior compare home BP monitoring alone telemonitoring plus case management , comprehensively assess cost-effectiveness , usability , acceptability . Our partner include TeleMED , medium size Canadian technology company wealth experience medical data management transmission ; Pharmacare , provide case-management service . The study take place senior ' supportive living residence ; virtue residing institution , senior complex care need . This intervention , effective , cost-effective safe , widely implement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telemonitoring Protocolized Case Management Hypertensive Community Dwelling Seniors With Complex Care Needs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Assess 'real world ' effectiveness , safety cost-effectiveness home BP telemonitoring combination protocolized pharmacist case management community-dwelling senior diabetes hypertension . Background : Hypertension , present 70 % senior , cause devastate cardiovascular complication premature death . Despite critical importance health , high BP uncontrolled 35 % senior diabetes ( i.e. , undertreatment ) . Conversely , antihypertensive drug therapy excessively low BP , cause serious adverse effect warrant drug discontinuation dose reduction ( i.e. , overtreatment ) . Both undertreatment overtreatment lead potentially preventable harm thus need minimize . Office BP measurement currently use monitor vast majority Canadians hypertension ; however , inaccurate Canadian guideline ( May 2015 ) instead strongly endorse use home BP home reading accurate convenient measure . Home reading take 3 way : 1. patient alone ( bears responsibility give reading provider ) ; 2. via telemonitoring , reading automatically summarize send care provider ; 3. telemonitoring plus protocolized case management , summarize reading review case manager ( usually nurse pharmacist ) authorize adjust treatment . Telemonitoring case management use Canada validation data country lack pre-requisite tech infrastructure exist . The patient alone method use exclusively many barrier pitfall ( include failure take proper number reading , report reading , calculate mean BP , use information optimally manage inappropriately high low BP ) . Design : In 1-year pragmatic , prospective , randomized open label trial blind ascertainment endpoint , 200 patient randomly assign ( 1:1 ) one 2 study arm : enhance usual care ( home BP monitor alone ) home BP telemonitoring plus protocolized case management . Randomization perform independent study team ( EPICORE Centre ) centralize computerized concealed process , stratify baseline BP ( versus 140 mmHg systolic BP ) . Outcomes assessor analyst mask allocation status . Blinded assessment primary endpoint ( 24-hour ambulatory BP ) perform . Methods : All participant receive validate electronic upper arm oscillometric BP device ( A &amp; D Ltd. UA-651BLE ; San Jose , CA ) set top box ( hub wireless data transmission secure server ) . Participants without internet access also receive cellphone data plan . Pushing single button activate device initiate BP measurement , auto-transmitted set top box via bluetooth connection . The academic research team collaboration TeleMED , Canadian base telemedicine company , build data transmission protocol ( use Secure Sockets Layer [ SSL ] encrypt data transmission ) TeleMED build maintain health portal platform . Four BP measurement take daily 1 week ( home BP series ) . If BP high low , home BP series do month BP therapeutic range . Once control , protocol repeat every 3 month , recommend guideline . Teletransmitted BP reading summarize within secure health portal use TeleMED software , use calculate overall weekly mean . Temporal trend plot . BP teletransmission occur study arm use differently . Consecutive , consent senior ( ≥65 year ) hypertension , recruit senior supportive living residence include ( necessarily limit ) 43 Greater Edmonton Foundation ( GEF ) Seniors Housing ( www.gef.org ) Rosedale Seniors ' Living ( rosedaledevelopments.com ) residences ; none resident currently receive telemonitoring case management . They follow study team period 1 year ; outcome assessment occur 6 12-months post randomization .</detailed_description>
