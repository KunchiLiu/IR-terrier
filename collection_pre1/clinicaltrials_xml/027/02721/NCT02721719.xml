	<brief_summary>The cause Inflammatory Bowl Disease ( IBD ) know , study patient IBD find patient make unusually strong immune response intestinal tissue bacteria normally live healthy gut . These overactive immune response might result imbalance T-lymphocytes , type white blood cell recognize respond threat like infection damage tissue . In healthy tissue , type T-lymphocytes call T-regulatory cell control excess inflammation prevent T cell , call T-effector cell respond . We believe T-regulatory cell somehow less active IBD , result damage intestinal tissue T-effector cell . T-lymphocytes , include T-regulatory T-effector cell , guide different part body 'alpha4beta7-integrin ' molecule . Vedolizumab Entyvio work block home molecule T cell reach intestine , stay blood aggravate IBD . This study help understand Vedolizumab help heal decrease symptom Ulcerative Colitis . The effect Vedolizumab different type T cell human intestine yet study . However , investigator think Vedolizumab shift balance T cell intestine towards heal T-regulatory cell less damaging T-effector cell . The purpose study measure different type T cell participant ' blood intestinal tissue Vedolizumab treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role CD4+ T Cell Subsets Mechanism Action Vedolizumab Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) umbrella term Crohn 's disease Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) , think cause disruption intestinal epithelial cell barrier , leading change intestinal flora consequent aberrant activation mucosal immune system . The result chronic intestinal inflammation highly dependent different subset CD4+ T helper ( Th ) cell . For example , correlative data suggest Crohn 's disease driven exaggerate Th1 Th17 cell response , since inflame lesion contain increased level cytokine associate cell include IFNγ , IL-12 , IL-17 IL-18 . In contrast , although Ulcerative Colitis family disease , typically associate Th2 cell since patient high level IL-13 intestinal mucosa compare patient Crohn 's disease healthy individual . Recent evidence implicate newly emerge Th9 subset Th cell pathology UC . The development function Th cell pathogenic potential kept check another subset CD4+ T cell , know regulatory T cell , Treg . In healthy individual , intestinal lamina propria large proportion Tregs , evidence simply lack Tregs lead IBD , suggest Tregs critical role control intestinal homeostasis . Indeed , work animal model early phase clinical trial show restoration Treg function ameliorate IBD . These data suggest effective therapy need promote function Tregs . Hence order understand mechanism action new therapeutic critical assess impact balance effector regulatory CD4+ T cell . Homing effector regulatory T cell intestine control variety integrins chemokine receptor , evidence expression alpha4beta7-integrin molecule ( α4β7 ) T cell key role process . Since Vedolizumab ( Entyvio ) specifically block interaction α4β7 ligands , express mucosal tissue , therapeutic effect IBD presume related reduction T cell traffic intestine . However , biologic agent specifically affect home Tregs versus effector T cell unknown . In human , Tregs peripheral blood report express low level α4β7 compare effector T cell , relative expression different subset ( i.e . Th1 , vs. Th2 , vs. Th17 ) CD4+ T cell unknown . Interestingly , intestine also subset Tregs produce IL-17 express high level α4β7 , functional relevance cell IBD unknown . In addition , mouse , expression α4β7 CD4+ T cell unstable inflammatory condition , suggest study circulate T cell healthy individual may accurately reflect integrin expression state inflammation . Understanding Vedolizumab affect localization circulate versus tissue-localized subset CD4+ T cell key understanding therapy work . Also unknown signal α4β7 affect development and/or function different subset CD4+ T cell . In T cell , integrins mediate homing , also provide tissue-specific signal . For example , act costimulatory molecule 10-12 influence cytokine production . The molecular basis effect T cell well characterize , cell integrins activate PI3K pathway , provide pro-survival signal 16 . Since show activation PI3K pathway regulate balance effector versus regulatory T cell 17 , possible blockade α4β7 may reduce PI3K signal favor development Tregs . In support possibility , show fibronectin , ligand α4β7 , inhibit development Tregs . This observational study determine expression pattern function α4β7 effector regulatory CD4+ T cell , define treatment Vedolizumab affect home function cell . We hypothesize treatment Vedolizumab shift balance effector regulatory T cell two mechanism : 1 ) alter migration different subset CD4+ T cell intestine ; 2 ) promote Treg stability consequence reduce PI3K signal downstream α4β7 .</detailed_description>
