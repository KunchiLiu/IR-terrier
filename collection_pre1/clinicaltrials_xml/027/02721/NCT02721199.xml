The use respiratory muscle EMG assess neural respiratory drive ( NRD ) demonstrate predictor readmission patient admit hospital COPD . The technique apply 'spot ' reading limited duration due need hand analysis data . It perform trained clinical physiologist remove interference data standardise data gather . New automate software allow long period observation , mostly unsupervised , result , NRD measurement likely affect various source variability .

	<detailed_description>Introduction Patients admit hospital acute exacerbation COPD risk significant in-hospital morbidity mortality . Current marker treatment success involve integration basic physiological variable ( respiratory rate , heart rate , oxygen saturation ) , clinical examination patient report symptom change . Whilst use physiological parameter gold standard remain concern patient deterioration often detect escalate effectively . This lead development implementation range clinical physiological composite score medical early warning score National Health Service ( NHS ) early warn score . However , score validate general rather specific population concern regard use respiratory patient groups.The use parasternal intercostal muscle EMG ( EMGpara ) report track clinical change identify treatment failure hospital admission acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) select unselected cohort . In pilot work measurement take research equipment data analyse individually trained physiologist . The clinical physiologist ensure standardisation record condition proximity medication , patient position , time day recent activity . The effect clinical physiological factor EMGpara minimise operator preventive measure , control measurement time , limitation record duration exclusion artefactual change EMGpara . The development automate software allow frequent sample continuous monitoring , potentially permit early detection clinical deterioration . With automated system however , clinical physiological factor need carefully consider , particular measurement perform unsupervised less closely supervised environment . This feasibility study therefore design investigate repeatability EMGpara hospital-based AECOPD management ( i.e . EMGpara change reflect change clinical status ) . It give u insight potential control/mitigation measure implementation , order ultimately minimise false reading . Study objectives To investigate clinical physiological factor may affect measurement EMGpara acute set enhance clinical effectiveness EMGpara identify treatment failure clinical deterioration .</detailed_description>
