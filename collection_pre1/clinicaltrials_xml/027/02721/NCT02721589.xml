	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Tolerability Using SHR-1210 Advanced Solid Tumor Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single center , nonrandomized , dose-escalation Phase 1 study evaluate safety tolerability SHR-1210 subject advance solid tumor fail current standard antitumor therapy . The safety tolerability SHR-1210 assess ongoing review clinical laboratory test , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , adverse event . Evaluations immune safety also conduct ( immune-related adverse event ( AEs ) , labs autoimmune serum , inflammatory event , immunogenicity ) . Safety evaluation ( clinical laboratory ) perform baseline , study treatment , throughout study . Efficacy assess every 8 week . The study consist 3 period : screening ( 28 day first dose ) , treatment , follow-up ( 3 month last dose study treatment ) .</detailed_description>

Female subject agree pregnant lactating begin study screen least 3 month receive last dose study treatment . Both men woman reproductive potential must willing able employ highly effective method birth control/contraception prevent pregnancy . A highly effective method contraception define one result low failure rate , , less 1 % per year use consistently correctly 8 . Able understand sign inform consent form ( ICF ) . 1 . Subjects active autoimmune disease history autoimmune disease , history syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive medication , include limited following : rheumatoid arthritis , pneumonitis , colitis ( inflammatory bowel disease ) , hepatitis , hypophysitis , nephritis , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism , except subject vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy . Subjects follow condition exclude study : asthma require intermittent use bronchodilator , hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement , vitiligo , Graves ' disease , Hashimoto 's disease . Additional exception may make medical monitor approval . 2 . Known history hypersensitivity component SHR1210 formulation . 3 . Concurrent medical condition require use immunosuppressive medication , immunosuppressive dos systemic absorbable topical corticosteroid . Doses &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent prohibit within 2 week study drug administration . Note : corticosteroid use purpose IV contrast allergy prophylaxis allow . 4 . Active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ( indicated clinical symptom , cerebral edema , steroid requirement , progressive disease ) . Subjects brain meningeal metastases previously treat must clinically stable ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] least 4 week apart show evidence new enlarge metastasis ) discontinue immunosuppressive dos systemic steroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week study drug administration . 5 . Uncontrolled clinically significant medical condition , include limited following : ( 1 ) congestive heart failure ( New York Health Authority Class &gt; 2 ) , ( 2 ) unstable angina , ( 3 ) myocardial infarction within past 12 month , ( 4 ) clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmia ventricular arrhythmia require treatment intervention . 6 .
