	<brief_summary>Sepsis constant concern ICU , frequent severe , require early diagnosis prompt implementation etiological treatment . The bacterial infection common associate high morbidity mortality . Diagnosis base detection micro-organism ( bacteria ) confirm diagnosis tailor antibiotic treatment . Blood culture positive 30-35 % case diagnosis often base body evidence use biomarkers . No biomarkers ( even combination biomarkers ) evidence confirm refute diagnosis sepsis alone . During sepsis , gram + gram - circulating often present small amount ; detect sensitive specific tool follow pretreatment blood sample ( innovative technology Bacti-DIAG ) . The main objective multicentre study Bacti-DIAG-Rea test prospectively , suspicious population resuscitation sepsis , new bacterial biomarker . Secondary objective ass whether Bacti-DIAG provide time precision gain ( gram + v gram ) patient 's care include diagnosis treatment . All ICU patient clinical criterion Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) sepsis suspect include : addition sample take routine care patient 4 tubes whole blood collect 5mL . The definitive diagnosis sepsis SIRS confirm retrospectively two independent expert blind Bacti-DIAG . The area ROC curve detection gram + gram calculate associated detection limit determine meet objective study . It plan include 400 consecutive patient SIRS criterion sepsis 300-360 analyze biometric biological data base subsequent evolution patient . The care patient blind result new biomarker Bacti-DIAG</brief_summary>
