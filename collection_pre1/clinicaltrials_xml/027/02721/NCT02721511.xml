	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety Efficacy Novel Furosemide Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study , treatment hospital set simulate patient would treat home feasibility study . The result pilot use inform design feasibility study . The future feasibility study test concept remove need professional care furosemide administration allow proportion patient go home treat safely home . A total 10 patient study use open label approach ass efficacy , tolerability safety subcutaneous administration novel furosemide regimen , administer subcutaneously . Patients refer hospital treatment fluid overload complete screening treatment phase . Subjects meet eligibility criterion administer test dose 80mg furosemide USP administer intravenous ( IV ) bolus 2 minute . Fluid intake restrict 2-hour observation period . Only patient respond test dose commercially available 80mg intravenous ( IV ) furosemide ( alternatively , bumetanide 2 mg IV ) mean diuresis excess 400 mL 2 hour eligible enter treatment phase study Investigational Medicinal Product . Patients respond equivalent dose furosemide bumetanide part clinical care heart failure hospital within 24 hour recruitment require test dose eligible entry study provide meet entry criterion study . Non-responders treat hospital usual care . Investigational Medicinal Product : Subjects Diuretic Responders treat Investigational Medicinal Product period 24 hour . Furosemide Injection Solution , 8 mg/mL ( 80 mg total dose ) administer subcutaneously mean B. Braun Perfusor® Space Infusion Pump System . The pump program deliver 80mg furosemide 5 hour 30mg administer first hour follow 12.5mg/hour 4 hour . Subjects treat twice daily dosing , default , may reduce daily desire reduce daily urine response . The duration frequency treatment determine attend cardiologist . If subject require diuresis 24 hour , convert usual care time . If attending cardiologist make determination time diuresis adequate , subject 's participation study stop , patient convert usual care . Urine output every 24 hour record , daily weight . Serum potassium , sodium , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine hemoglobin assess daily . All patient monitor heart rhythm continuously hospitalization . Temperature every 8 hour record , injection site assess daily sign erythema .</detailed_description>
