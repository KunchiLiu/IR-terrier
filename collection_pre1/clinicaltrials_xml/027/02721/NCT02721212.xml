	<brief_summary>54 inpatient participant randomly divide two group ( experimental conventional ) . Individual experimental group treat accord establish protocol ARMEO Spring ( 30 minutes/session `` Armeo Spring '' 30 minutes/session conventional treatment 5 days/week 6 week ) . The conventional treatment consist passive active assist mobilization upper limb , traditional training base Bobath concept . Inpatients control group treat conventional treatment training session 60 minute 5 days/week 6 week . All patient evaluate blind observer use outcome test enrollment ( T0 ) , treatment ( T1 ) follow 6 week later ( T2 ) . We assess impact functional recovery ( Functional Independence Measure - FIM scale ) , strength ( ARM Motricity Index-MI ) , spasticity ( Modified Ashworth Scale-MAS ) pain ( Numeric Rating Pain Scale -NRPS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact New Technology Functional Recovery Upper Limb Post Stroke Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Authors conduct double blind randomize control trial . Informed consent obtain participant procedure conduct accord Declaration Helsinki . The protocol ( N° U0074917/11110 ) approve Local Ethical Committee Bergamo , Italy . A number clinical trial show significant advance upper limb recovery use different sensory - motor technique , include intensive repetitive movement , constraint-induced movement therapy , functional electrical stimulation treatment , use robot-assisted therapy association virtual reality . Robot-assisted virtual reality intervention show effective conventional intervention achieve improvement upper limb function , however effect size report recent review small datum always report cost-benefit ratio challenge use virtual reality technology rehabilitation . Robot aid rehabilitation increasingly use stroke rehabilitation , broad spectrum apply technology motor non-motor aid system , pose problem match clinical need patient proper device . In immediate post stroke period motor recovery usually allow use non-motored robot device use motor robot aid month delay obtain valuable clinical result . The wide range available device certainly richness clinical possibility also critical factor select suitable technology tailor clinical feature patient actual state art . This affect comparison interpretation literature far publish . Virtual reality therapy recreate favorable condition motor learning . Functional recovery achieve use-dependent cortical reorganization . The time/intensity application therefore pivotal point learn process . Its duration standardize varies 3-4 20 hour total treatment make result accordingly variable , add bias data interpretation . A prerequisite gain best result patient selection early application possible.All factor , ascribe possible cause small effect size report recent literature compare robot-aided virtual reality rehabilitation versus traditional rehabilitation alone.In group patient hemiparesis follow stroke , compare efficacy neurorehabilitation program consist combination non-motor robot-assisted therapy virtual reality ( Armeo®Spring ) conventional therapy primary aim verify punctual application suggest single paper able improve difference efficacy treatment , therefore , create well effect size . And , secondary arm , possible improve clinical picture also post-acute stroke patient secondary aim , motor selection intensive treatment improve small effect size report literature .</detailed_description>
