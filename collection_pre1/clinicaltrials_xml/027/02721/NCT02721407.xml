	<brief_summary>The goal clinical trial study feasibility efficacy anti-CD22 : TCRz:4-1BB chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) -modified T ( CAR-T ) cell treat recurrent patient refractory resistant lymphoma anti-CD19 : TCRz : CD28 CAR-T cell . Recently , cancer immunotherapy , treatment aim arm patient immunity specifically cancer cell , emerge promising therapeutic strategy . Among many emerge immunotherapeutic approach , clinical trial utilize CARs B cell malignancy demonstrate remarkable potential . CARs combine variable region antibody T-cell signal moiety confer T-cell activation target specificity antibody . Thus , CARs MHC-restricted vulnerable MHC regulation tumor . However , define recession evaluable lesion , persistence efficacy CAR-T cell still restrict `` target '' selection . Previous clinical study largely utilized CD19 vivo target CAR-T cell , preferentially become refractory resistant due heterogeneity lymphoma . This clinical investigation test hypothesis whether anti-CD22 CAR-T cell work effective lymphoma patient refractory resistent anti-CD19 : TCRz : CD28 CAR-T cell .</brief_summary>
