	<brief_title>Study Evaluation Efficacy Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) Patients With Rare Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base disease type . There 10 group enrol study 10 different disease type test . Up 25 participant enrol 10 disease group . Study Drug Administration : You receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 21-day study cycle . The time dose may increase side effect . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Every week Week 9 , every 2 week Weeks 9 54 , every 4 week Week 81 treatment end , whichever come first , complete questionnaire health feeling . This questionnaire either email receive phone call automate voice system ask question . Between Days 15-21 Cycle 1 : - If doctor think possible , tumor biopsy perform PD test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Every 9 week : - You CT scan , MRI , bone scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn tumor marker test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD test . On Day 1 Cycles 4 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot check thyroid function ( every 3 cycle ) . - Urine collect routine test ( every 3 cycle ) . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . If doctor think need , test may perform often . Stopping Pembrolizumab : If cancer get bad 24 month study , stop take study therapy . You complete safety follow-up visit disease status monitor every 8 week image scan . If point time cancer get bad , may eligible receive additional 12 month treatment pembrolizumab Second Course . When stop taking study drug ask come safety follow-up visit 30 day later start new treatment cancer , whichever come first . Second Course Treatment : If stop take study drug disease go away , disease come back later , may able start take study drug . This know `` Second Course Treatment '' . Depending tumor type , tumor marker data also collect study . Repeated Tests If The Disease Gets Worse : If image scan show cancer may worsen , may ask another imaging scan least 4 week later confirm . The study doctor discus option period scan , may include follow : - Continue receive treatment study drug ; - Have study drug hold time follow-up scan ; - Discontinue study instead receive FDA approve drug . You may eligible receive treatment different investigational drug . If decide stay study confirmation scan , eligible receive drug worsen disease confirm . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 24 month , long doctor think best interest . If disease get bad complete 24 month treatment stop treatment , may continue take drug 12 month doctor think best . You longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . End Treatment Visit : After last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD test . - You CT scan , MRI , bone scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn tumor marker test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . - If doctor think possible , tumor biopsy perform PD test . - If visit happen Week 81 , complete questionnaire health feeling . Follow-Up Visit : Within 30 day last pembrolizumab dose : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test , check well blood clot , thyroid function test . - Urine collect routine test . Every 9 week last pembrolizumab dose : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You CT scan , MRI , bone scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn tumor marker test . Every 12 week last dose pembrolizumab , contact phone ask . The call take 15-20 minute . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve treatment certain type melanoma non-small cell lung cancer , however approve advanced cancer . In study use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 250 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
