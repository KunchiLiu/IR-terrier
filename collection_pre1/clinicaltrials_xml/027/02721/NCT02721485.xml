	<brief_summary>Salt fluid use extensively acutely ill patient admit hospital . Two salt fluid commonly use Normal Saline Ringer 's Lactate . Both used rehydrate patient , restore fluid volume help stabilize blood pressure fail organ . Both salt fluid use several decade . Until recently , think fluid essentially equivalent minor difference relate concentration salt component ( sodium chloride ) buffer ( Ringer 's Lactate lactate buffer ) . Recent data suggest salt fluid contain less chloride like Ringer 's Lactate , cause less acid blood , less kidney failure , less death . However , study date small weak design possible important difference affect patient . Hence , research team conduct robust pragmatic clinical trial several academic community hospital randomize use either Ringer 's Lactate Normal Saline period three month . The trial yield high quality robust data determine Ringers Lactate reduce death re-admissions hospital . Before embark large-scale trial , important conduct small ( pilot ) trial evaluate large trial feasible costly . In small trial involve less 4 hospital , investigator determine well fluid intervention adhere hospital , record long take receive approval research ethic board ready start study . The investigator also record challenge develop solution relate operation trial , describe important clinical outcome data essential design plan large trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Other administration oxygen , crystalloid resuscitation fluid common intervention administer majority hospitalize patient . These fluid may use life save measure re-establish hemodynamic stability , rehydration , replace loss maintain intravascular volume surgical setting . In province Ontario alone , approximately 1 million patient per year receive one resuscitation fluid hospital admission . The two common usual care resuscitation crystalloid fluid Normal Saline Ringer 's Lactate recently evidence suggest one crystalloid fluid clinically superior . However , safety Normal Saline question due high chloride content association development hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis . Studies healthy volunteer observational study critically ill surgical patient population associated saline increase risk acute renal injury requirement dialysis , post-operative infection , death increase resource blood transfusion use . The evidence base currently weak give majority study observational suffer methodological weakness include confound indication , selection bias , inability disentangle effect specific fluid due interaction co-interventions administer . As , several author editorial call adequately power randomize control trial clinically relevant outcome determine Ringer 's Lactate indeed superior Normal Saline resuscitation . Given widespread use , small difference clinical outcome crystalloid resuscitation fluid highly relevant . Furthermore , small absolute difference important clinical outcome translate significant saving hospital health care system . To illustrate , death hospital re-admissions reduce absolute 0.5 % , would translate approximately 2500 life save saving 10 million dollar Ontario health care system . Hence , collaboration Canadian Critical Care Trials Group , Crystalloid FLUID Choices Hospitalized Patients ( FLUID ) trial examine whether Ringer 's Lactate compare Normal Saline reduce clinically important outcome death , hospital re-admissions - outcome particularly relevant hospital health care system . This proposal large pragmatic cluster cross-over comparative effectiveness trial conduct academic community centre Ontario . It involve waiver consent novel design making use provincially available health administrative data Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) facilitate data collect trial . The trial answer fundamental fluid resuscitation question much less cost comparison individual patient randomize controlled trial . It help build expertise capacity future trial similar design province Ontario throughout Canada . However , prior embark large-scale trial , imperative conduct pilot trial determine feasibility optimize trial design .</detailed_description>
