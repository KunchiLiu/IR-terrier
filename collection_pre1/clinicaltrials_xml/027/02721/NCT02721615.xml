	<brief_summary>About thousand people year United Kingdom survive spinal cord injury leave paralysed wheelchair-bound . The annual cost care spinal cord injury victim half billion pound . We propose spinal cord injury , cord pressure injury site rise , damage spinal cord secondary ischaemia . The value measure reduce cord pressure spinal cord injury unknown . The injured spinal cord compress bone malalignment cord swell . Current management involve realign fix bony fragment use metal screw , rod plate . We hypothesise : 1 . Bony realignment alone adequately decompress swollen cord , remain compressed surround dura . 2 . That duraplasty reduces intra spinal pressure effectively bone realignment alone . 3 . Localised hypothermia reduces intra spinal pressure improve metabolism . We develop novel method measure cord pressure metabolism injury site spinal cord injury determine whether cord pressure rise , long , impact spinal cord metabolism . This pilot study find whether spinal cord pressure metabolism measure spinal cord injury whether effected treatment choice .</brief_summary>
