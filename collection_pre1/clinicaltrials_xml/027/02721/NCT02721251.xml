	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) highly prevalent among Veterans , associate significant mortality multiple morbidity . Available treatment limit effectiveness treat OSA alleviate associate morbidity . The investigator ' previous research find reduction OSA severity approximately 25 % follow modest exercise training . That effect occur independent weight loss raise excite possibility exercise combine weight loss could reduce OSA least 50 % unique health benefit OSA patient . Following screen baseline assessment , 90 overweight Veterans age 18-60 year OSA randomize one three 16-week treatment : ( 1 ) exercise training ; ( 2 ) 10 % weight loss ; 3 ) exercise + weight loss . Changes OSA relate morbidity compare treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Approximately 15-20 % adult obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , evidence indicates prevalence OSA perhaps twice high among Veterans . OSA clearly link increased mortality multiple morbidity , undoubtedly contribute high prevalence health problem among Veterans . Current treatment OSA well tolerate , often limited efficacy , often result improvement health . The investigator ' recent research demonstrate 12 week moderate exercise training elicit reduction OSA ~25 % , well significant improvement mood , fatigue , quality life , cardiovascular health . Interestingly , health benefit exercise , investigator ' research consistent research show exercise reduce OSA independent change body weight . These study raise excite possibility exercise training combine modest weight loss could elicit chronic reduction OSA 50 % . Objectives : The investigator ' Objective compare effect 16 week exercise train alone , weight loss alone , exercise + weight loss OSA severity associate morbidity . Methods : Following extensive screen baseline assessment , N=90 overweight/obese Veterans ( age 18-60 year ) mild severe OSA randomize one three 16-week treatment . ( 1 ) Exercise Alone ( n=30 ) involve train 4 day per week supervision clinical exercise physiologist . It include aerobic exercise ( treadmill , cycling , elliptical ) gradually increase 30-45 min 4 days/wk , well resistance exercise ( 15 min ) 2 days/week . ( 2 ) Weight Loss Alone ( n=30 ) involve structure meal plan ( include meal replacement shake bar ) , weekly counseling design elicit reduction body weight 10 % . ( 3 ) Exercise + Weight Loss ( n=30 ) involve exercise weight loss intervention treatment . Outside intervention , participant ask maintain usual exercise diet habit , verify , respectively , actigraphic record 24-hr food recall . Before treatment , participant undergo 5 days/nights home-based actigraphic diary-assessed sleep , one night laboratory polysomnographic record sleep , include OSA severity . Comorbidity measure include pre- post-treatment change blood pressure , glucose , insulin , lipid , hemoglobin a1c , body weight/composition , inflammation ( e.g. , CRP , IL-6 ) . Also measure monthly change self-reports sleep quality , functional outcome sleepiness ( FOSQ ) , snore symptom . A 3-month follow-up include home assessment OSA , well sleep quality , FOSQ , snore . Mediation analysis explore whether improvement OSA mediate change percent deep sleep , body weight , trunk body fat percent , trunk total mass , respiratory muscle strength , upper airway obstruction assess laboratory . Implications Future Research . Demonstration reduction OSA 50 % would result extensive subsequent study . These would likely include study dose-response effect ; comparison different mode exercise ; study feasibility telemedicine approach intervention ; comparative efficacy study vs. PAP ; mechanistic study , example , upper airway collapsibility composition ( e.g , via MRI ) ; study positive health outcome , extensive heart imaging .</detailed_description>
