	<brief_summary>This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial total 100 patient free gallstone baseline . The study involve take oral drug ( Ursodeoxycholic Acid 250mg ) placebo twice daily period six month undergo total three abdominal ultrasound ( 6 month , 12 month , 18 month ) check gallstone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Ursodeoxycholic Acid Use Prevention Gallstone Formation After Sleeve Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant proportion patient know develop gallstone phase rapid weight loss bariatric surgery . A small percentage patient develop symptom abdominal pain , nausea , vomit , occasionally serious symptom relate gallbladder disease . Those patient may require surgery removal gallbladder even though risk gallbladder surgery increase patient group . The investigator would like provide patient undergone Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy drug reduce risk develop gallstone phase rapid weight loss surgery . The drug , Ursodeoxycholic acid , FDA approve reduction gallstone formation obese patient undergo rapid weight loss never proven effective , randomize controlled study , subgroup obese patient undergo Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy . If prove , investigator intend influence current practice patient offer Ursodeoxycholic Acid reduction gallstone formation complication follow Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy . In randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial , subject approach principal investigator clinic information take part study , decision make undergo Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy weight loss . The surgeon answer question thereafter . The investigator clarify participation voluntary alter routine care whether patient participates . The study involve take oral drug ( Ursodeoxycholic Acid 250mg ) twice daily period six month undergo total three abdominal ultrasound ( 6 month , 12 month , 18 month ) check gallstone . Patients gallstone free initial ultrasound satisfy study inclusion criterion . Ultrasound test radiation free pose additional risk subject . A total 100 patient need recruit . The sample comparable current study sufficient prove disprove hypothesis low risk error ( ref ) . The patient either receive placebo drug study , placebo dispense pharmacy color ursodeoxycholic acid . The principal investigator radiologist measure result blind whether subject receives drug placebo . The study need involve human subject result applicable human subject . The risk small drug FDA approve 13 year post-marketing experience related indication know well tolerate . All effort make protect privacy confidentiality subject include protect personal information remove identifier data record store identify code separate location , study material password protection lock key time .</detailed_description>
