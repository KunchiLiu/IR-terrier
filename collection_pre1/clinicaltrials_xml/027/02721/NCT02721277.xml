	<brief_summary>Parenteral nutrition ( PN ) provide intravenous nutritional supplementation infant unable absorb adequate enteral nutrient secondary insufficient intestinal length function . In early PN-associated cholestasis , dose traditional soy base lipid limited 1 g/kg/day often limit growth capacity parenteral nutrition-dependent infant . Inadequate growth directly relate poor neurological outcome , failure facilitate mechanical ventilation , less growth neonate 's already damage intestine . Ultimately , outcome lead severe disability death . To mitigate deleterious effect optimize growth , parenteral nutrition-dependent infant cholestasis adequately grow 1 g/kg/day soy-based lipid emulsion must great intake lipid meet need weight , length , head circumference growth . SMOFlipid contain mixture 4 different lipid source : soybean oil provide essential fatty acid , olive oil high monounsaturated fatty acid less susceptible lipid peroxidation polyunsaturated fatty acid , medium-chain triglyceride show faster metabolic clearance long-chain triglyceride , fish oil provide supply omega-3 fatty acid . The utility Omegaven soy-based lipid emulsion limit restrict 1 g/kg/day cholestatic infant . SMOFlipid safe provide usual goal infusion amount 3 g/kg/day . Because product include omega-6 omega-3 lipid , provide benefit omega-3s liver provide enough omega-6s meet essential fatty acid requirement . Its use situation growth inadequate baby must restrict 1 g/kg/day expect improve growth likely markedly increase chance good neurological outcome survival . The aim research study determine unique formulation SMOFLipid cause less hepatic inflammation compare soy intralipids .</brief_summary>
