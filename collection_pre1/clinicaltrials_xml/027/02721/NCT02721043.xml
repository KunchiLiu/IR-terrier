	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety , tolerability , immunogenicity Personalized Genomic Vaccine 001 ( PGV001 ) subject advanced non-hematologic malignancy . PGV001 peptide vaccine base patient 's tumor sequence . Each patient 's tumor sequence peptide correspond tumor make . These peptide combine adjuvant Poly-ICLC ( Hiltonol® , Oncovir ) make PGV001 . The adjuvant Poly-ICLC add boost immune response peptide together expand immune cell target cancer .</brief_summary>
