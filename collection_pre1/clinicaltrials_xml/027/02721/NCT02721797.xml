	<brief_summary>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome ( EDS ) inherit disease collagen , find connective tissue , skin . EDS patient suffer joint skin problem ( skin hyperextensibility , joint hypermobility ) along large range disorder , include , delay wound heal atrophic scarring , easy bruising , tissue fragility , gastrointestinal gum problem . There many different type EDS , different mechanism action , well understood . This study use advanced microscopy technique call atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) scan electron microscopy ( SEM ) analyse change collagen result EDS , compare normal collagen . These change view micron nanoscale level ( 1,000 100,000 x magnification ) , focus difference collagen construction process call cross-linking . These change could potentially help clinician understand root cause EDS symptom , provide deep knowledge cross-linking disorder collagen . Increasing knowledge collagen affect EDS patient , may lead improved treatment option patient .</brief_summary>
