	<brief_summary>This randomise control cross-over trial involve adult cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient Royal Brompton Hospital , London investigate outcome measure use airway clearance trial . Each participant attend research facility two visit . Participants randomly assign order perform study session . Visit A involve period rest 60 minute in-between assessment ; Visit B involve session airway clearance ( ACT ) utilise ACBT supervise specialist physiotherapist adult CF . Participants perform outcome measure ( OM ) test impulse oscillation system ( IOS ) , lung clearance index ( LCI ) , spirometry , either rest ( visit A ) perform supervise ACBT session ( visit B ) use electronic impedance tomography ( EIT ) session . IOS , LCI spirometry repeat session . Sputum collect throughout ACT rest session 30 minute session complete . Questionnaires ask patient view OMs complete end study visit . Analysis base upon difference outcome measure in-between study day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Question : Does use new assessment tool box ( Electronic Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) , Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) , Impulse Oscillation System ( IOS ) ) give result sensitive change effect airway clearance technique ( ACT ) ( Active Cycle Breathing Techniques ( ACBT ) ) low variability good repeatability stable adult patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) traditional gold standard outcome measure force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) sputum wet weight ? Hypothesis : The use new outcome assessment tool box allow sensitive information effect ACTs stable adult patient CF current gold standard measure . This randomise control cross-over trial involve adult cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient Royal Brompton Hospital , London . Participants control . Each participant attend research facility two visit . Prior start study assessment session participant question ensure stable state disease ( characterise symptom treatment change 28 day prior visit ) . All participant continue time prescribe dose inhaled medication direct prior study . Subjects control . Subjects randomly assign order perform study session . Visit A involve period rest 60 minute in-between assessment ; Visit B involve session airway clearance ( ACT ) utilise Active Cycle Breathing Techniques ( ACBT ) supervise specialist physiotherapist adult CF . The ACT session last thirty minute minimum , 60 minute maximum consensus reach participant physiotherapist participant 's chest clear . Subjects perform OM test impulse oscillation system ( IOS ) , lung clearance index ( LCI ) , spirometry , either rest ( visit A ) perform supervise ACBT session ( visit B ) use electronic impedance tomography ( EIT ) session . IOS , LCI spirometry repeat immediately session . Sputum collect throughout ACT rest session 30 minute session complete . Questionnaires ask patient view OMs give completion last OM test complete study visit . There plan follow measurement participant study design . All usual medication permit study . Attention pay mucoactive drug ( Pulmozyme® , Mannitol® , Hypertonic saline ) ensure frequency dose inhalation study visit . Data analyse 3 group base upon disease severity . Analysis base upon difference outcome measure in-between study day .</detailed_description>
