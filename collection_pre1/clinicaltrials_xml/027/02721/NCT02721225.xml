	<brief_summary>More 20 million infant worldwide , represent 16 per cent birth , bear low birth weight , 96 per cent develop country . Bangladesh one high incidence rate ( 21.6 % ) world.The short-term consequence LBW 12 time high perinatal mortality . It estimate LBW cause 60 80 % neonatal death . For survivor , effect long last largely irreversible . Infants born LBW 2-4 time great risk develop acute diarrhea , pneumonia acute respiratory tract infection normal birth weight counterpart . Adults born LBW suffer increase risk high blood pressure , coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , obstructive lung disease , renal damage . Genitourinary ( GU ) infection , major risk factor low birth weight delivery affect large number woman industrialize develop world . In Bangladesh , high incidence UTI 21-25 year age group ( 44.61 % ) . The bottom line GU infection lactobacillus , healthy bacteria lose dominant . Recently , protective role commensal microbiota come focus infection-inhibiting function . Lactobacilli colonize gastrointestinal tract vagina either significantly modulate colonic microbiota increase number specific prebiotic bacteria lactobacilli bifidobacteria reduce undesired intestinal colonization pathogenic bacteria . Prebiotic like Fructooligosaccharide ( FOS ) know promote growth normal healthy flora like lactobacillus ( LAB ) . FOS supplementation early pregnancy improve vaginal gut microflora LAB , control GU infection improve pregnancy outcome promote infant 's growth development</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prebiotic Preventing Low Birth Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical research last ten year identify genitourinary ( GU ) infection , major risk factor low birth weight delivery affect large number woman industrialize develop world . It estimate 1 billion woman affect annually urinary infection worldwide . Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) also common bacterial infection pregnancy . In Bangladesh , high incidence UTI 21-25 year age group ( 44.61 % ) . The bottom line GU infection lactobacillus , healthy bacteria lose dominant . The role normal vaginal micro-biota urogenital health Recently , protective role commensal microbiota come focus infection-inhibiting function . Lactobacilli favourite probiotic ( `` health promoting '' ) bacteria . There clinical evidence show Lactobacillus strain GR-1 RC-14 show reduce UTI , BV infection associate yeast pathogen . Fructoligosacharride , prebiotic agent At present , considerable attention focus determine way increase number probiotic microorganism include lactobacilli colonize gastrointestinal tract vagina . Prebiotics substance either significantly modulate colonic microbiota increase number specific probiotic bacteria lactobacilli bifidobacteria reduce undesired intestinal colonization pathogenic bacteria mimic attachment site intestinal mucosa . Design method In , double- blind , placebo- control study , 210 early pregnant community woman ( 6-12 week gestation ) randomize either FOS placebo , administer orally , 6g/day 6 month . Vaginal smear urine sample follow LAB use Nugent 's score exclude UTI respectively . Birth event include weight document . Stool nasopharyngeal sample infant obtain week-24 , 30 , 36 see level LAB . Anthropometry diseases morbidity monitor infancy . Outcome measures/variables : - Primary : 1 . Incidence LBW ( birth weight 2500 gram ) - Secondary 1 . Rate vaginal intestinal colonization LAB and/or GU infection week 12 , 24 , 36 gestation gain z-score ( weight height , weight age height age ) infant birth</detailed_description>
