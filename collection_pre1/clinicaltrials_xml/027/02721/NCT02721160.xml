	<brief_title>Measuring Understanding Effects Performance Based Financing Scheme Applied Nutrition Services Burundi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Malnutrition huge problem Burundi . In order improve provision service hospital , health center community level , Ministry Health pilot introduction malnutrition prevention care indicator within performance base financing ( PBF ) scheme . Paying unit service qualitative indicator expect enhance provision quality nutrition service , PBF do , Burundi elsewhere , several service . The Nutrition PBF intervention The intervention focus child five year old . It follow standard PBF model Burundi combine quantitative indicator encourage increase service delivery ( see ) qualitative indicator . Quality nutrition activity assess quarterly , bonus penalty applied subsidy receive facility accord quality score . Table : Incentivized indicator Community health worker ( CHW ) level - nb case screen referred health center acute malnutrition ( AM ) - nb class promote good nutrition Health center ( HC ) level - nb case screen care severe moderate AM - nb growth follow-ups Hospital level - nb treat severe AM case complication - length stay All hospital nutrition service fall Nutrition PBF program . At low level , HCs intervention group CHW refer subject Nutrition PBF . Theory change The introduction nutrition activity PBF program translates policy maker ' belief PBF trigger positive change performance health personnel , facility system eventually impact household child . The investigator identify seven track transmission effect health facility performance : - The income track : injection extra financial resource might positive effect nutrition service , allow health facility manager recruit staff , good equip facility , etc . - The cash track : fact financial resource transfer directly health facility 's bank account allow latter rapidly autonomously spend . - The incentive track : extra resource condition upon high performance nutrition activity ; motivate community actor staff improve performance order boost health facility 's income ( bonus distribute among health worker ) . At facility level , effect service unclear : negative ( e.g . staff charge nutrition use responsible service overlook , relatively less financially reward ) positive others ( economy scope - i.e . dedicate effort nutrition activity , reduce effort require activity , thanks synergy ) . - The information track : contract , fee system relate information session , staff clearer view performance , far nutrition service concern . Feedback program may also guide decision improve . The investigator hypothesize positive effect nutrition service . However , incentive track , negative effect could activity remunerate may perceive non-important . - Supervision &amp; enforcement track : new scheme , verification extend nutrition activity ; mean interaction supervisor personnel charge nutrition . On top possible subsequent transfer information ( e.g . advice good practice ) , supervision may activate interpersonal motivator . - Culture provider level track : PBF scheme invite health facility manager develop work culture favorable innovation , flexibility , responsibility entrepreneurship . As PBF national policy five year , one assume already case Burundi . However , one exclude could positively influence nutrition department . - Health system track : argue PBF trigger several system effect [ 1 ] . Here , part effect might come supervisor impact evaluation ( e.g . MoH request UNICEF WFP well supply nutrition input ; WB solve problem may affect study ) . Another part might come health facility ( e.g . pressure upon Department Nutrition within MoH reliable responsive supplier ) . The investigator expect community actor refer malnourished child health center health center refer severe acute malnourish child referral hospital . This may trigger unexpected feedback loop . Method The research design consist mixed method model adopt sequential explanatory design . The quantitative component cluster-randomized controlled evaluation design : among 90 health center select study , half receive payment relate result malnutrition activity ( Nutrition PBF intervention group ) , half get budget allocation ( Control group ) . Qualitative research mainly carry end quantitative evaluation . The evaluation aim provide best estimate impact project malnutrition outcomes community well output health center level ( malnutrition care output ) describe quantitatively qualitatively change take place ( take place ) within health center result program . Data collection Quantitative data collection consist two round health center household survey : baseline survey implementation intervention , endline survey two year . The household survey collect information nutritional health status select child , age 6-23 month , well general information household ( include socio-economics , food security index ) . The health facility survey consist various tool . To get information malnutrition recovery rate , total 24 individual clinical file randomly select among file child five year old enrol moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM ) care program ( 12 file ) severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) care program ( 12 file ) last six month transcribe . In addition , organizational aspect health center well nutrition service record interview manager . To assess quality service , investigator combine two technique : patient-provider observation carry six pediatric consultation ( perform maximum two health worker ) exit interviews end observe consultation , order get information satisfaction level well record anthropometrics child . Finally , ass knowledge observe health worker , investigator use vignette measure practical knowledge different task perform : pattern pediatric consultation propose health worker ask question ( related history physical exam ) necessary arrive diagnosis propose treatment . Three vignette administer every health worker observe consultation . During survey round , lot quality assurance survey perform regularly field coordinator assess accuracy anthropometric data record . Most data enter `` real-time '' , irregularity detect corrected field coordinator continuous basis . Data entry do use electronic device . Android smartphones Open Data Kit software ONA internet data management platform choose purpose . The electronic data entry advantage reduce risk error record answer ( thanks automatic validity check ) , eliminate need double data entry paper software transcription decrease considerably time transcription . Some questionnaire though need perform paper ( like patient-provider consultation use observation grid paper ) : double entry session organize avoid entry error . Sample size assessment The sample size household survey compute small difference main outcome consider public health significance , i.e . reduction 25 % acute malnutrition prevalence ( 2.5 % point absolute term ) intervention center ' catchment area compare control center ' one . Assuming intervention result decrease prevalence MAM child age 6-23 month 10 % 7.5 % [ 2 ] , assume 65 child age 6-23 month survey catchment area health center , 90 health center need randomize either intervention control group , α-error 5 % β-error 20 % . The number child per health center increase 72 allow miss incomplete data , amount total 6,480 child age 6-23 month 90 select health center . In total , sample 6,480 child survey baseline , , two year start program , another sample 6,480 child age 6-23 month survey . Selection health center invite participate study do simple randomization ( computer-based random selection ) among 193 eligible health center , i.e . health center provide nutrition service ( treatment SAM MAM ) . The 90 select health center pair essential parameter organization function relation outcome ( MAM rehabilitation activity , volume activity , population catchment area , percentage recovery among malnourished child ) measure baseline survey . This use control potential confounding effect parameter . Within 45 pair , allocation intervention do randomly lottery system organize workshop December 2014 . The sample size clinical file within health center survey compute small difference main outcome consider public health significance intervention center . Assuming intervention result increase recovery rate acute malnutrition child under-24 month 80 % 90 % , α-error 5 % , power 80 % inter-cluster correlation ( ICC ) 0.15 [ 3 ] , minimum 12 clinical file per health center per nutrition service ( MAM SAM rehabilitation service ) need , among child register six previous month [ 4 ] . Analysis strategy plan First , descriptive analysis carry order understand main feature malnutrition management health service general Burundi health center level . Validation design perform baseline survey data compare treatment group control group . Second , survey round ' data , impact intervention assess multilevel statistical model random effect health center level . Continuous dependent variable analyze mixed-effect regression model , whereas categorical one ( e.g . recovery yes/no ) analyze logistic regression Poisson regression model . At population level , factor child malnutrition , household food security , socio-economic status , etc. , control . Interactions season , child age sex , stunt , socio-economic parameter analyze . An equity analysis also perform order understand whether intervention benefit poorer rich household . At health facility level , factor child malnutrition recovery , instance health facility staff ' knowledge know-how , control . Interactions child age sex , stunt MUAC analyze . Discussion Although PBF scheme bloom low in-come country , still need evidence , especially impact revise list remunerate indicator . It expect impact evaluation helpful national policy dialogue Burundi , also provide key evidence country exist PBF scheme confront malnutrition problem appropriateness extend strategy nutrition service .</detailed_description>
