	<brief_summary>Background rationale : Children hospitalise severe anaemia Africa high risk readmission death within 6 month discharge . No strategy specifically address post-discharge period . In Malawi , 3 month post-discharge malaria chemoprevention ( PMC ) monthly 3-day treatment course artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) child severe malarial anaemia prevent 31 % deaths readmission . The effect addition effect insecticide-treated bednets . There need design evaluate effective delivery mechanism PMC within health system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective trial determine optimum PMC delivery mechanism compare community- versus health facility-based strategy order inform policy . Study Type : This single-centre , match , cluster randomize , 5-arm , factorial design trial compare uptake PMC-DHP deliver health facility community-based approach without SMS/HSA reminder . Site : 90 village catchment area Zomba Central hospital southern Malawi Study Population : Inclusion criterion : convalescent child age less 5 year weigh &gt; 5 kg admit severe anaemia ( haemoglobin &lt; 5g/dL / Ht &lt; 15 % ) ; clinically stable , able take switch oral medication ; post-transfusion Hb &gt; 5g/dL . Exclusion criterion : blood loss due trauma , malignancy , know bleed disorder sickle cell trait , know hypersensitivity study drug , know heart condition , non-resident study area , previous participation study , know need enrolment prohibit medication schedule surgery course study . HIV infection cotrimoxazole prophylaxis exclusion criterion Study Interventions : All child receive Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( 3-day treatment course , give 2,6 10 week discharge ) either : 1. discharge + SMS Reminder ; 2. discharge + No SMS Reminder ; 3. discharge + HSA Reminder ; 4. OPD + SMS Reminder ; 5. OPD + No SMS Reminder Outcome Measures : Primary : 100 % PMC drug uptake ( defined administration 3-day treatment course , give 2 , 6 10 week discharge ) assess unannounced spot check . Follow-up procedure : Children follow 15 week passive case detection 2 phase : Pre-PMC ( 2 week hospital admission 2 week post-discharge ) ; PMC ( 2-14 week post-discharge ) Sample Size : A sample size 75 child per arm ( 375 total child ) allow detection 25 % increase uptake 50 % 75 % 10 % loss follow-up ( power 90 % , Î±=0.05 ) . Data Analysis : The % child receive IPTpd accord schedule compare relative risk ( 95 % CI ) , adjust prognostic factor baseline use log binomial Poisson regression adjustment cluster effect</detailed_description>
