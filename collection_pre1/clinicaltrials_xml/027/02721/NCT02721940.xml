	<brief_title>Mononuclear Cells , Platelets Zoledronic Acid Preventing Collapse Femoral Head Osteonecrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteonecrosis femoral head ( ONFH ) common degenerative disease cause variety factor , trauma , alcoholism , use corticosteroid , systemic lupus erythematosus . In ONFH , overall mechanical property femoral head change time , collapse femoral head result severe pain disability . Although numerous strategy treat ONFH , conservative treatment often ineffective . Once collapse femoral head occurs , hip replacement option ONFH patient . Therefore , important reduce osteonecrotic weaken femoral head early stage ONFH prevent subsequent head collapse . Studies show bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity , reduce bone resorption , retain bone trabecula , reduce apoptosis osteoblast osteocytes , promote new bone formation . Therefore , investigator choose use bisphosphonates prevent collapse osteonecrotic femoral head . Zoledronic acid potent bisphosphonate treatment ONFH . It reduce bone resorption preserve shape femoral head . In case , bisphosphonates give intravenously orally . However , systemic administration associate many complication , include osteonecrosis mandible atypical femur fracture . As previously report , poly ( lactic-co-glycolic acid ) act drug carrier facilitate local release zoledronic acid , find promote bone formation help avoid complication cause systemic administration . Using method administration , zoledronic acid reach locally therapeutic level , thereby prevent femoral head collapse . ONFH reduce viability bone marrow hematopoietic cell bone cell vary degree , even induce cell death . Adult red bone marrow two distinct part ; hematopoietic section contain hematopoietic stem cell , mesenchymal section contain mesenchymal stem cell promote bone regeneration . Core decompression technology reduce intraosseous pressure , improve venous return , promote revascularization femoral head , effectively reduce symptom osteonecrosis ; however , clinical efficacy currently unsatisfactory , probably insufficient bone formation repair . In recent year , use bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BMMCs ) show good short-term clinical efficacy treatment ONFH . However , long-term outcome unknown , know whether combined therapy platelet-rich plasma may effective treatment femoral head collapse early stage ONFH . Here , investigator propose prospective , randomize control trial ass clinical efficacy local administration enrich BMMCs , platelets zoledronic acid prevent femoral head collapse early stage ONFH . Safety assessment During trial , inspector responsible monitoring adverse reaction patient . If adverse reaction observe follow-up , patient urge call doctor assistance . Predicted complication include fever , joint pain , joint snapping , joint noise , joint swelling , limited mobility , itchy skin . Patients urge inform family member close friend observe symptom participate clinical trial . If patient question participate trial , inform contact doctor . All serious adverse event record detail—including date occurrence , duration , treatment , possible relationship therapeutic procedures—and report research director ethic committee within 24 hour . Data collection management All data collect case report form , include demographic information , disease diagnosis , concomitant disease . Data record electronically use double-data entry strategy . After follow-up , data check locked principal investigator . The locked data , modify , save subsequent analysis . All data relevant clinical trial save Chinese PLA General Hospital . Then , data statistically analyze professional statistician , statistical result report principle investigator responsible write research report . The Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) responsible data monitoring management throughout entire trial , ensure scientific accuracy , authenticity , integrity . Statistical analysis Data statistically analyze use SPSS 22.0 ( IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Measurement data normally distribute expressed mean , standard deviation , minimum value maximum value . Data non-normally distribute express low quartile ( q1 ) , median upper quartile ( q3 ) . Count data express percentage ( % ) . Where appropriate , two-tailed test use , statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 . Baseline data compare group , statistically analyze use two-tailed test α = 0.05 . Count data compare group use chi-square test Fisher exact test . Measurement data compare group use t-tests , nonparametric variable compare group use rank sum test .</detailed_description>
