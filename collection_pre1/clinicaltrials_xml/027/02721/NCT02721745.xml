	<brief_summary>While scientific community understand quite well muscle ache prolong exercise , origins mental fatigue remain totally mysterious . Existing theory remain psychological level , scarce support evidence . Mental fatigue typically occur long episodes human exert control motor cognitive process , instead execute routine stimulus-driven behaviour . However , work organization ( especially risky job like airplane control medical profession ) pathology due overload work ( like burn-out ) seem directly link neural fatigue . One consequences neural fatigue alter decision-making . As example , choice immediate monetary reward large delay monetary reward ( call intertemporal choice ) susceptible fatigue state underpinning neural network . The investigator propose exploratory study neural fatigue , induce either natural way ( perform cognitive task hour ) transcranial stimulation , use three main physiological measure ( Electro-encephalography measure neural activity , indirect calorimetry measure metabolic cost cognitive effort , pupillometry measure cognitive effort ) . This study allow good understand consequence neural fatigue cognitive function like decision make well associate physiological variable .</brief_summary>
