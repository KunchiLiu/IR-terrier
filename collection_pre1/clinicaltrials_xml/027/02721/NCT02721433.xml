	<brief_title>4-weekly Versus 12-weekly Administration Bone-targeted Agents Patients With Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone metastasis common patient advance breast prostate cancer . Skeletal metastasis associate reduced Quality Life ( QoL ) , pain skeletal-related event ( SREs ) ( defined pathological fracture , surgery/radiotherapy bone , spinal cord compression hypercalcaemia ) . Maintaining QoL avoid delay SREs main goal therapy . Patients therefore receive bone-targeted agent ( e.g . pamidronate , zoledronate denosumab ) typically give every 4 week . However , 4 week dose base convenience treatment could give concurrently chemotherapy . The half-life drug bone many month even year . Hence study perform evaluate 12-weekly therapy . These confirm similar palliative outcome 4 vs 12-weekly group breast prostate cancer patient . However , remain clinical equipoise dose interval physician prescribe . The current trial compare two schedule bone-targeting agent ( 12- vs. 4-weekly ) evaluate quality life , pain skeletal event within Canadian Health Care System . This study use `` integrated consent model '' involve `` oral consent '' rather write informed consent write process study compare standard schedule new administration schedule .</detailed_description>
