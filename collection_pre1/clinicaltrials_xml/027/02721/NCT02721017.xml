	<brief_title>Cryoanalgesia vs. Epidural Nuss Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain control major challenge physician , must ensure appropriate effective pain control patient , remain mindful many negative effect opioid dependence addiction . Nowhere press need child young adult , high risk drug abuse , post-operative care , since post-operative opioid use start point long-term pain issue . Postoperative pain control Nuss procedure , minimally invasive repair congenital chest wall deformity know pectus excavatum , remain significant problem 3000 patient undergo procedure year , mostly adolescents young adult . Many multimodal analgesic regimen try , optimal treatment remain unknown . This study test novel promise strategy use intra-operative cryoanalgesia Nuss procedure . Cryoanalgesia localize , temporary freeze peripheral nerve , perform time Nuss procedure . The study 20-subject prospective , randomized pilot trial compare cryoanalgesia thoracic epidural analgesia post-operative pain control patient undergo Nuss procedure . Subjects recruit patient already schedule Nuss procedure institution , undergo 1:1 randomization either cryoanalgesia thoracic epidural analgesia perioperative pain control . During hospitalization , patient ' opiate usage prospectively record , pain assess twice per day . Upon discharge , patient maintain log opiate use , return clinic 2 week , 1 month , 3 month , 1 year Nuss procedure post-operative assessment . Primary outcome length perioperative hospitalization , objective measure synthesize many different aspect procedure subsequent post-operative course , include pain control . Secondary outcome post-operative narcotic usage direct cost perioperative hospitalization . Side effect intervention also assess . This first systematic investigation cryoanalgesia local nerve block thoracoscopic procedure , first study involve use adolescent young adult . The result direct application undergo Nuss procedure repair pectus excavatum . Investigators also delineate reproducible protocol deliver cryoanalgesia thoracoscopically , ensure others safely effectively use method prof beneficial . Although focus small subset patient undergo Nuss procedure , standardize approach cryoanalgesia delivery thoracoscopic procedure positive effect patient outcomes cost hospitalization , technique could apply variety surgical procedure , well neuropathic pain .</detailed_description>
