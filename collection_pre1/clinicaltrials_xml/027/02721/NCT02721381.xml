	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy Self-directed &amp; Therapist-assisted Telehealth Parent Training Intervention Children With ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) chronic pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder characterize deficit social communication presence restrict repetitive behavior . Individuals ASD often require intensive comprehensive intervention across life span . There dramatic increase number individual diagnosis last two decade , current prevalence rate high 1 68 . However , correspond growth availability evidence-based intervention service , contribute high level unmet service need individual ASD family . The vast majority family child ASD report receive substantially few hour service recommend National Research Council . Furthermore , level unmet service need even high family reside rural medically underserved community . Thus , systematic research focus develop improve strategy dissemination implementation evidence-based ASD service high priority , particularly chronically underserved community . Parent training program one cost-effective ecologically valid way increase access evidence-based ASD intervention . Training parent provide intervention increase number intervention hour child receives improve child outcome . A number study demonstrate parent learn use evidence-based intervention strategy high degree fidelity child experience gain language social communication development , decrease disruptive behavior , great generalization maintenance child skill . These benefit recognize parent , report parent train effective practice promote child 's overall development . Parent training also improve family quality life increase parent self-efficacy reduce parent stress , particularly important give high rate stress depression find parent child ASD . Despite benefit , continue barrier dissemination train parent . Formal parent train program rare community-based early intervention setting young child ASD . For example , recent North Carolina survey , 8 % parent child ASD 4 report receive parent training . Barriers provision parent training include shortage trained professional , lengthy waitlists , limited financial resource transportation , lack child care , geographic isolation , time limitation . These barrier may even pronounce family live rural area , long distance , poor road , climatic barrier limit ability parent receive service . Thus , essential consider adaptation evidence-based parent training program non-traditional service delivery model increase access service . Telehealth , provision health service information Internet related technology , potential replace , least , augment traditional service model increase access evidence-based service . Users telehealth program able interact directly instructional content video , animation , active learning task , well individual , include expert clinician , via email teleconferencing system . The number individual access internet-based technology grow considerably recent year ( File T , 2013 ) , estimate 75 % U.S. households home computer high-speed internet , nearly 87 % adult able access internet home , work , elsewhere . Telehealth service become increasingly common 3,000 U.S. site use distance-based service delivery model provide patient care . Telehealth program reduce patient provider cost increase provider system coverage relative traditional in-person service delivery model . Such program show greatly improve care patient chronic disease , diabetes , heart disease , asthma , increase access evidence-based health promotion ( i.e. , smoke cessation , dietary change , physical activity ) , psychological ( i.e. , CBT depression anxiety ) , parent intervention . Patients often satisfy care receive telehealth service , efficacy study find moderate large effect telehealth intervention participant knowledge behavior change . Further , several recent meta-analyses find CBT deliver via telehealth effective traditional therapist-delivered intervention . Taken together , data suggest telehealth may serve promise alternative service delivery model increase dissemination ASD parent training program . Telehealth intervention either self-directed , participant engages interactive program pace , therapist-assisted , participant receive additional guidance train professional completes program . Self-directed program far great dissemination potential require train professional typically administer much reduce cost . At time , research telehealth CBT intervention mood anxiety find therapist-assisted program lead well client outcomes self-directed program . This finding may particularly relevant telehealth parent training intervention , research suggest parent coach important increase parent ' fidelity implementation , coach core component exist evidence-based parent training intervention child ASD . There grow interest extend telehealth intervention parent train child ASD ; yet empirical evaluation program limit . Several uncontrolled study self-directed telehealth parent training program show parent child ASD find program highly acceptable , program use associate gain parent knowledge evidence-based intervention procedure . Preliminary empirical study suggest parent learn implement evidence-based intervention technique fidelity use self-directed telehealth parent train program . A small control study find parent give access DVD-based self-directed program make great gain correct use pivotal response training ( PRT ) strategy , provide child language opportunity , display great confidence parent-child interaction , parent no-treatment control group . Using single-subject design , demonstrate parent improve correct use reciprocal imitation training ( RIT ) techniques complete web-based , self-directed program . However , one third participant require additional in-person coaching order meet pre-determined fidelity implementation criterion . In study , improvement child behavior target intervention also observe . Importantly , parent study indicate immediate feedback coaching expert clinician would helpful addition program . Several recent single-subject design study examine efficacy therapist-assisted telehealth parent training program child ASD . Researchers examine effect DVD-based web-based program conjunction weekly remote coaching session via video-conferencing teach parent Early Start Denver Model ( ESDM ) . Results suggest parent increase correct usage intervention strategy alter engagement style attentive responsive child therapist-assisted telehealth program . Furthermore , child study demonstrate gain important social communicative behavior ( e.g. , language , imitative behavior ) . In attempt evaluate relative contribution self-directed instruction remote coach parent learn RIT , researcher conduct second study measure parent ' use RIT technique child prior complete self-directed , web-based program , complete self-directed program receiving remote coach via video-conferencing , receive remote coaching . Similar previous study , parent improve correct use intervention technique response self-directed program , roughly third show additional benefit provision remote coaching . In addition , child demonstrate gain imitation skill ( target intervention ) onset treatment ; however , child gain robust coach portion program . These preliminary finding suggest telehealth parent train intervention highly acceptable parent child ASD , result improvement parent knowledge implementation evidence-based intervention technique gain child social communication skill . To date , study conduct head-to-head comparison self-directed therapist-assisted telehealth parent training intervention . However , data thus far indicate parent coaching may necessary , parent successfully implement evidence-based intervention technique fidelity . A nuanced appreciation contribution offer component , well parent likely benefit , make possible develop cost-effective delivery model service offer different level intensity , depend specific need family ( i.e. , stepped-care ) . ImPACT Online interactive , web-based telehealth intervention teach parent promote child 's social-communication skill play daily routine . The intervention content adapt Project ImPACT , manualized parent training curriculum use blend developmental naturalistic behavioral intervention technique , include follow child 's lead , imitate child , use heighten animation , use simplified language around child 's focus attention , environmental arrangement strategy , prompt , natural reinforcement child-directed activity . There strong empirical support intervention technique increase social communication child ASD . In addition , several study demonstrate efficacy original parent training curriculum increase parent fidelity child language skill . The original curriculum design implement 12 week either individual group format in-person parent trainer . The investigator adapt program intervention content present 12 interactive , web-based module lesson . These lesson administer standalone intervention ( self-directed model ) combination remote coaching ( therapist-assisted model ) . Program development guide technology acceptance model56 , medium richness theory57,58 , principles instructional design59 . To ensure usability , The investigator use iterative development process input focus group parent intervention provider , interview pilot participant . The investigator conduct feasibility trial self-directed therapist-assisted model 25 family , majority ( 75 % ) reside rural medically underserved area . Our data thus far strongly support acceptability feasibility web-based module remote coach protocol , suggest model use effectively reach individual reside underserved community . Further , data lend preliminary support positive effect program parent fidelity implementation , self-efficacy , child language . The next step evaluate ImPACT Online conduct fully-powered RCT control group evaluate comparative efficacy self-directed therapist-assisted telehealth intervention model key parent child behavior , well examine potential mediator moderator treatment outcomes . Statement Problem Research indicate early , intensive intervention lead significant improvement child ASD . There dramatic increase prevalence ASD past two decade , correspond growth availability evidence-based intervention service . This lead high level unmet service need individual ASD family . Parent train one cost-effective ecologically valid approach increase access intervention . Additional benefit include increase parent self-efficacy decrease parent stress . Yet , continue barrier involve dissemination train parent . Telehealth intervention potential replace , least augment , traditional service model increase access evidence-based service , particularly rural medically underserved area . There increase evidence suggest program reduce patient provider cost increase provider system coverage relative traditional in-person service delivery model . Although grow interest extend telehealth intervention parent train child ASD , empirical evaluation program limit , little known regard relative benefit self-directed therapist-assisted telehealth intervention ASD . Self-directed program far great dissemination potential require train professional typically administer much reduce cost . At time , research telehealth intervention disorder find therapist-assisted program lead well client outcomes self-directed program . A good understanding relative benefit two delivery format parent child outcome , well family format least effective , crucial development effective efficient telehealth parent training intervention . The specific objective project conduct randomize control trial examine effect novel , telehealth parent train intervention child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , ImPACT Online , parent child outcome . The investigator compare benefit self-directed therapist-assisted delivery format , examine moderator mediator treatment outcomes . The investigator anticipate self-directed therapist-assisted model ImPACT Online effective method teach parent use evidence-based intervention strategy increase parent self-efficacy compare web-based information control group . Parents ' use strategy greatly enhance amount evidence-based intervention child receive improve generalization maintenance skill , positively impact child 's language development . The investigator anticipate parent therapist-assisted group outperform parent self-directed group primary parent outcome measure group level ; however , moderator analysis may indicate parent approach less effective . These data key inform stepped-care model parent offer intervention different level intensity ( self-directed therapist-assisted ) , depend specific need family . Further , approach parent train successful , potential greatly increase access evidence-based intervention child ASD , especially live rural underserved area . Ninety family young child ASD assess pre-treatment ( T1 ) , randomize self-directed ImPACT Online , therapist-assisted ImPACT Online , web-based information control condition , receive treatment 4 month . Outcome assessment occur post-treatment ( T2 ) 3-month follow-up ( T3 ) . Aim 1 : To examine comparative efficacy self-directed therapist-assisted ImPACT Online parent outcomes post-treatment 3-month follow-up . The primary goal ImPACT Online teach parent use specific intervention technique promote child 's social communication development . As parent gain knowledge skill help child , self-efficacy parent expect increase . Thus , The investigator compare effect two telehealth intervention model parent fidelity parent self-efficacy post-treatment 3-month follow-up . It hypothesize family randomize either two telehealth condition demonstrate great gain parent fidelity parent self-efficacy post-treatment 3-month follow-up parent assign control group . Given research telehealth intervention disorder suggest added benefit therapist-assistance , hypothesize family randomize therapist-assisted telehealth condition demonstrate great gain parent outcomes relative parent self-directed telehealth condition post follow-up . Aim 2 : To examine comparative efficacy self-directed therapist-assisted ImPACT Online child outcomes 3-month follow-up . Parent use intervention technique time expect lead improvement child verbal language . Thus , The investigator compare effect two intervention model child verbal language 3-month follow-up . It hypothesize family randomize either two telehealth condition demonstrate great gain child verbal language follow-up parent assign control group . Given strong effect parent outcomes expect therapist-assisted intervention , hypothesize family randomize therapist-assisted telehealth condition demonstrate great gain child verbal language relative parent self-directed telehealth condition follow-up . Aim 3 : To examine whether pre-treatment parent stress moderate effect ImPACT Online parent fidelity parent self-efficacy post-treatment . Our goal identify family different telehealth delivery format least effective . Prior research indicate negative association pre-treatment parenting stress level treatment outcomes ASD parent training intervention . Thus , The investigator examine pre-treatment parenting stress putative moderator parent treatment response . It hypothesize effect ImPACT Online parent fidelity parent self-efficacy stronger parent low pre-treatment level parent stress . It anticipate pre-treatment parenting stress level may also differentially impact parent outcomes two telehealth delivery format . For example , high level pre-treatment parent stress may likely negatively impact parent outcomes self-directed group , parent additional support coach . Thus , also hypothesize relationship parent stress parent outcomes strong self-directed group therapist-assisted group . Aim 4 : To examine whether gain parent fidelity parent self-efficacy post-treatment mediate effect ImPACT Online child verbal language 3-month follow-up . In ASD parent training study assume improvement child outcome result improvement parent ' ability implement treatment . However , relationship rarely directly test . While parent fidelity likely candidate , also possible change important parent behavior , parent self-efficacy , may important factor promote child change . For example , may parent feel self-efficacious parent role may engage child often , high expectation child 's behavior , may effectively advocate child 's need , might result `` non-specific '' treatment effect . Thus , The investigator examine mediator child change well understand parent training model affect child outcome . Specifically , The investigator examine whether improvement child verbal language result treatment mediate change parent fidelity and/or parent self-efficacy . It hypothesize effect ImPACT Online child verbal language 3-month follow-up great child whose parent demonstrate great gain parent fidelity parent self-efficacy pre- post-treatment . Aim 5 ( exploratory ) : To identify predictor adherence ImPACT Online . In order fully capitalize benefit telehealth , important understand factor influence parent adherence ImPACT Online . The investigator select one program-level ( therapist assistance ) three individual-level ( computer/internet fluency , parent expectancy , treatment acceptability ) factor find influence adherence parent train and/or telehealth-based intervention previous work . The investigator also examine whether sociodemographic variable predict treatment adherence . It hypothesize therapist assistance predict adherence , therapist-assisted group exhibit great adherence self-directed group , computer/internet fluency , parent expectancy , treatment acceptability positively associate adherence ImPACT online . Finally , The investigator hypothesize sociodemographic variable find predict treatment adherence . Research Design Methods Participants . 90 child ASD age 18 72 month recruit study . This sample size determine adequate maintaining adequate power propose statistical analysis , allow attrition . To ensure sample include sufficient number participant traditionally underserved , The investigator oversample participant live federally designate rural and/or medically-underserved area , additional risk factor associate decreased access care , include low parental education , single-parent household , racial ethnic minority , immigrant status . To eligible , child must receive DSM-V-informed clinical diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder base Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) . In light research suggest diagnostic stability lower child 30 month . Results diagnostic testing young child sample interpret cautiously discuss parent sensitive transparent manner . Children history significant brain injury , know neurological genetic condition , significant sensory motor impairment , major medical problem exclude might expect respond differently child ASD require program modification . Participants recruit ongoing contact community agency professional serve young child ASD Michigan . The P.I . extensive experience recruit family young child ASD intervention study . Previous research effort , include pilot RCT ImPACT Online , strongly suggest The investigator able recruit propose number participant . The MSU Autism Lab use number strategy ensure retention , include maintain responsive relationship participate family , provide clinical consultation referral , maintain contact newsletter periodic family outing . Retention rate previous study , include pilot RCT intervention , 90 % . Group assignment . It possible group difference child age and/or developmental quotient ( DQ ) intake could affect internal validity study . Thus , participant stratify age ( 18-35 month ; 36-72 month ) developmental quotient ( DQ &lt; 50 ; DQ≥50 ) prior randomize . After stratification age DQ , participant randomly assign one three group use random permute block 6 . This approach show yield group closely balance regard size relevant pre-treatment characteristic . All pre-treatment assessment collect prior randomization prevent bias test base knowledge future group placement . Children three group continue receive exist educational programming . It expect non-treatment intervention participation differ systematically across group ; however , information amount type outside service change service collect child monthly basis throughout participation . All family express need computer high speed internet provide loaner laptop high speed internet service plan duration participation . Training plan coach fidelity Therapist-Assisted Group . Therapists provide remote coach master ' level project staff train fidelity coach procedure PI . Training include combination didactic training , observation remote coaching session , role play , hands-on coaching practice child ASD parent . All therapist require establish fidelity non-study participant prior begin study , determine &gt; 90 % correct implementation Coaching Fidelity Checklist ( Ingersoll &amp; Dvortcsak , 2010 ) . This training approach highly successful ensure fidelity therapist . Coaching fidelity data collect randomly select sample 20 % session analyzed ensure correct implementation remote coaching procedure . If therapist fall 90 % correct implementation , PI provide additional training feedback therapist re-establishes fidelity . Assessment protocol . Participants group receive assessment 3 time point : pre-treatment ( prior randomization ) ( T1 ) , post-treatment ( T2 ) , 3-month follow-up ( T3 ) . A 3-month follow-up chosen allow time child beneﬁt parent ' use intervention strategy , ensure follow-up assessment child complete within project period . Each assessment period consist three four hour test , involve direct child assessment , home observation parent-child interaction , parent-report measure parent child function complete family home . Examiners blind study objective treatment group assignment conduct assessment . Assessments require behavioral coding videotape score trained observer blind treatment condition . One-third assessment cod second , independent observer determine interobserver agreement . Families compensate $ 25 per assessment period ( $ 75 per family ) .</detailed_description>
