	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia remain leading cause maternal morbidity mortality , develop develop world . It complex , multisystem disease , severe form , affect cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , neurological haematological system . The University Cape Town-associated medical institution alone responsible treatment 800 woman 2014 , classify preeclampsia severe feature . Given complexity disease , anesthetic management Caesarean section patient remain challenge . Recent study begin demonstrate novel marker preeclampsia severity , include point-of-care ultrasound ( POC-US ) acid-base ( AB ) abnormality . For example , pilot study demonstrate approximately 25 % woman diagnose severe preeclampsia show sign increase intracranial pressure elevate lung water evaluate point care ultrasound . These finding could serve noninvasive marker disease severity , thus may use predict maternal fetal outcome preeclamptic woman . Point care ultrasound play increase role perioperative diagnosis , new , less expensive device continuously develop , likelihood play important role South Africa near future . In recent trial perform University Cape Town , comprehensive acid-base analysis severe preeclamptic woman demonstrate significant abnormality independent acid-base determinant . In addition , strong indication find change acid-base status preeclampsia pronounce early pregnancy associate urgent delivery . As clinical arena critically ill patient , acid-base abnormality associate increase lung water , increase intracranial pressure , outcome , hypothesize similar association might find severe preeclamptic woman . Therefore , one aim study evaluate association venous acid base abnormality ( inexpensive readily available test ) observe late onset severe preeclampsia organ manifestation identify ultrasound , well-validated robust tool identify manifestation . Investigators examine association ultrasound finding and/or venous acid-base abnormality urgent delivery . It intend subsequent comparison early- late onset preeclampsia , suitable tertiary site identify .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I . Introduction / Specific Aims Preeclampsia major cause maternal mortality ( 15-20 % developed country ) acute long-term morbidity mother newborn . It multi-system disorder characterise abnormal vascular response placentation , associate increase systemic vascular resistance , enhance platelet aggregation , activation coagulation system , endothelial dysfunction . Preeclampsia define number sign symptom , characterize multi-organ change encompass central nervous system ( CNS ) , lung , liver , kidney , systemic vasculature , coagulation , heart . Derived clinical arena intensive care medicine , new potential marker disease severity woman diagnose preeclampsia recently identify . Using noninvasive point-of-care ( POC ) ultrasound , pulmonary interstitial edema raise intracranial pressure identify 25 % 20 % respectively woman show feature severe preeclampsia . In addition , echocardiographic laboratory study woman diagnose preeclampsia indicate incidence diastolic dysfunction increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ( LVEDP ) 30 % . These finding could significant impact maternal outcome detail methodology anesthesia care parturient severe preeclampsia ( PreE ) , include mode anesthesia , position patient , fluid management , hemodynamic goal . In recent investigation perform comprehensive physicochemical acid/base analysis pre-eclamptic woman ( AB-PreE-Trial ) , presence simultaneous hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis hyperchloraemic acidosis identify . In addition , investigator find indication hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis mark early versus late onset disease associate mode delivery . In critical care arena show reduced albumin acid-base abnormality associate pulmonary interstitial edema , elevate intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , poor clinical outcome . Venous acid-base analysis may therefore widely available inexpensive marker pulmonary interstitial edema elevate ICP preeclampsia , potentially important impact anesthesia care . Therefore , one aim evaluate association elevate base excess change albumin concentration ( BE ( Alb ) ) pulmonary interstitial edema increase ICP ( evaluate non-invasive ultrasound ) patient late onset severe preeclampsia . Investigators evaluate association urgent delivery ( fetal maternal indication ) . Long-term goal use finding guide clinical decision-making anaesthetist identify individual patient acute organ system failure , help well plan anaesthetic management Cesarean delivery . Also , finding large future study could predict maternal fetal complication , show difference early- late onset disease . This significant future benefit South African context , preeclampsia lead cause maternal morbidity mortality . II . Aims Aim 1 : To explore association ultrasound finding and/or venous acid-base abnormality , urgent delivery . It hypothesise patient acid-base change secondary albumin , interstitial edema and/or elevate ICP experience great proportion urgent delivery , compare patient without abnormality . Aim 2 : To determine association pulmonary interstitial edema increase ICP change BE ( Alb ) . Primary Hypothesis : Based prior study show association low albumin increase extravascular lung water bad cerebral edema hypothesise mean BE ( Alb ) high patient pulmonary interstitial edema increase ICP ( assess POC ultrasound ) , compare patient without interstitial edema normal ICP . Point-of-care ultrasound validate method identify pulmonary interstitial edema elevate ICP . Sample size calculation : Aim 1 : Among patient late onset disease , prior data suggest 30 % patient BE ( Alb ) &gt; 4 meq/L , rate fetal distress &gt; 70 % population , compare fetal distress rate 25 % woman BE ( Alb ) &lt; 4 meq/L . Based observation 70 % woman late onset disease BE ( Alb ) &lt; 4 meq/L diagnosis , consider alpha level 0.05 power 0.8 , 70 patient need reject null hypothesis predict delivery status BE ( alb ) &gt; 4mEq/L . Aim 2 : In addition , available data suggest incidence elevate intracranial pressure interstitial pulmonary edema diagnose ultrasound severe preeclampsia approximately 25 % , elevate BE ( Alb ) find approximately 30 % patient severe preeclampsia . Prior data critically ill patient indicate mean albumin 2.8 g/dL ( SD 0.7 ) patient normal lung water , compare mean albumin 2.2 g/dL ( SD 0.7 ) patient increase lung water . When convert BE ( Alb ) scale ( assume mean pH 7.4 ) biologically plausible assumption similar relationship ICP , order show statistically meaningful difference mean BE ( Alb ) level among patient severe preeclampsia without interstitial edema without elevated ICP , need recruit total 80 patient , alpha level 0.05 power 0.9 . Furthermore , BE ( Alb ) scale , mean BE ( Alb ) low albumin group ( mean albumin 2.2 g/dL ) approximately equal BE ( Alb ) 4 meq/L may represent important clinical endpoint . Thus , assume normal distribution , 50 % group expect BE ( Alb ) &gt; 4 meq/L . The increased albumin group ( mean albumin 2.8 g/dL ) lie approximately 1 standard deviation decrease albumin group , assume normal distribution , would expect 18 % group exceed BE ( Alb ) &gt; 4 meq/L cut point . Using two proportion , chi-squared test sample ratio 3:1 , power 0.8 , alpha level 0.05 require total sample size 84 patient ( 21 ultrasound finding 63 without finding ) .</detailed_description>
