	<brief_summary>Clinical definition acute kidney injury ( AKI ) base increase serum creatinine decrease urine output . However , apply definition neonate remain challenge normal renal physiologic feature serum creatinine level expect increase first day birth , impaired sodium reabsorption concentrate ability . Because several limitation early detection AKI , investigator focus identify biomarkers predict AKI increase serum creatinine level . Investigators collect urine preterm infant administrate ibuprofen closing patent ductus arteriosus . To identify novel biomarkers , investigator analyze urine proteomics . To verify biomarkers , investigator use initial urine first day life preterm infant diagnose AKI within 7 day birth without risk factor AKI enrol institutional bio-repository .</brief_summary>
