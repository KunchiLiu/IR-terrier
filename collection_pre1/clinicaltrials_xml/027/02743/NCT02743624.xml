	<brief_summary>The indication mechanical ventilation ( MV ) include excessive work breathing , without evidence respiratory muscle fatigue . The setting MV still challenge base criterion understudied , often subjective observer-dependent . Despite several study , knowledge never do precise definition optimal range ventilatory support . Novel recognizable diagnostic technique apply . No single parameter breathe pattern good accuracy adjustment ventilatory support . Non-invasive measure P0.1 rate muscle relaxation may good accuracy adjustment ventilatory support .</brief_summary>
