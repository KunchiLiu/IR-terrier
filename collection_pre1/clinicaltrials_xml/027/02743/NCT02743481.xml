	<brief_summary>Background : The Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) study farmer spouse North Carolina Iowa . It also include people work pesticide Iowa . They answer questionnaire give data child bear since 1975 . Researchers want link data public data like birth death certificate . They want study early life exposure farm link cancer bad health outcome . Objective : To study data find link early life farm exposure negative health outcome . Eligibility : There human subject . Design : Researchers get public data two study state . This come thing like : Birth certificate Driver license Voter registration Death certificate Based plus AHS data , create study group . It call Early Life Exposure Agriculture ( ELEA ) . Researchers link ELEA data cancer data . This identify prevalence cancer . They study parent answer AHS . The topic include farm practice pesticide use . They determine ELEA exposure pesticide . Researchers analyze cancer pesticide result look link .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There increase evidence early life exposure may influence future health outcome although critical need fully understand may differ exposure receive later life . The farm environment include pesticide suggest increase cancer risk child adult . A review literature identify crucial gap knowledge highlight need accurate exposure assessment , include separate parental interview , specific pesticide exposure question , semiquantitative exposure measure use confirm information obtain questionnaire 2 . Some study suggest time exposure may particularly important . For example , study insecticide DDT breast cancer , researcher observe high risk among woman expose prior age 14 compare later life 3 . The agricultural environment also include exposure animal , allergen , endotoxin . These exposure may influence immune function , particularly expose young age , subsequently affect later cancer risk . The Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) prospective cohort study farmer spouses reside North Carolina Iowa , commercial pesticide applicator reside Iowa . At enrollment ( 1993-7 ) woman ( farmer spouses farmer ) provide information child bear since 1975 , include name , gender , SSN date birth . In previous analysis conduct use Iowa AHS data cancer incidence all-cause mortality child age 19 , finding suggest increased risk incident cancer among child associate use certain pesticide parent . The mortality analysis focus fatal injury sustain , indicative dangerous nature work farm6 . In collaboration researcher University Iowa , currently update previous analysis new cancer incidence information 2011 information provide University Iowa , perform linkage Iowa birth certificate identify additional child bear AHS participant 1975-2009 . With proposal , propose expand linkage Iowa include child previously include , link North Carolina registry first time identify additional 2 birth , cancer incidence mortality . This establish unique cohort agriculturally expose offspring , comprehensive information parent farm practice , well information . These data use evaluate hypothesis early life agricultural exposure influence cancer risk . Previous analysis focus childhood cancer ; include cancer diagnose birth adulthood .</detailed_description>
