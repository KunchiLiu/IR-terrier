	<brief_title>Sedentary Behavior Interrupted - A Pilot Study Acute Interventions Prolonged Sitting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sedentary behavior , characterize excess sitting time waking hour , detrimental health increase cardiometabolic disease ( e.g. , type 2 diabetes ) risk , independent moderate-to-vigorous physical activity . The mechanisms mediate unknown evidence-based method know effectively intervene sedentary behavior . The consequence prolong sit time particular interest older adult sedentary behavior cardiometabolic disease risk increase age moderate-to-vigorous physical activity may feasible . The investigator propose pilot feasibility test intervention sedentary old adult design interrupt prolong sitting time . Interrupting sit time sit-to-stand transition , stand walk break increase muscle use blood flow low part body . Thus , investigator believe frequent sit-to-stand interruption sit time efficacious sedentary behavior intervention , compare simply reduce sit time le frequent walking break , improve health outcome healthy age . The investigator hypothesize frequent sit-to-stands 5-hour sit period result health benefit observe simple 2-minute stand interruption , associated improvement metabolism endothelial function . This pilot , 10-participant study 1 ) generate preliminary data revise Program Project Grant application National Institute Aging ( NIA ) focus postmenopausal woman , fast grow age population high life-time risk cardiometabolic risk . This pilot study inform sit interruption modality design two project investigator ' Program Project Grant application : `` Project 1 : Sedentary Behavior Interrupted : A randomized crossover treatment trial acute effect biomarkers healthy age laboratory ( 86 participant ) '' `` Project 2 : Sedentary Behavior Interrupted : A randomized trial 6 month effect biomarkers healthy age physical function real world ( 660 participant ) . '' The current design pilot study enhance responsive feedback initial NIA submission . This pilot study increase knowledge sedentary behavior sit interruption intervention influence healthy age postmenopausal woman . SPECIFIC AIM The deleterious health consequence much sit independent moderate-to-vigorous physical activity . Understanding health consequence sit time particularly relevant old adult extremely sedentary high risk several chronic disease link sit time , include type 2 diabetes . Interestingly , sedentary behavior least study among old adult may benefit reduce sit time . Reducing uninterrupted sit time old adult research priority pervasiveness sit time , typically &gt; 8 hour per day , provide many opportunity intervention . Specific intervention require reduce sit habitual behavior reinforce social norm chair-dominant context . In pilot study , investigator focus three different type prolong sit interruption variable . Studies show frequent break sit may reduce risk cardiometabolic disease . In old adult , investigator anticipate frequent sit-to-stand transition impact metabolic , inflammatory biomarkers , particular relate mitochondrial endothelial function . A key limitation previous sedentary intervention study impact frequency sit-to-stand transition ; rather , decrease total sit increase standing time . Further , previous sedentary intervention study directly compare frequent sit-to-stand transition interruption interruption modality associate less frequent sit-to-stand transition , example , reduce overall sitting time ( stand ) occasional walk break . The investigator propose test sedentary behavior interruption modality disrupt prolonged sit explore mitochondrial- endothelial function-based mechanism action . Biologic theories suggest interrupt sit via sit-to-stand muscle contraction increase blood flow extremity key improve healthy age outcome . In controlled laboratory study prolong sit , 3 different interruption break type utilized . Ten sedentary , postmenopausal participant 55+ year age body mass index ( BMI ) 27-45 enrol . After screen enrollment , participant visit clinic 4 occasion 6-hour monitoring period , follow 1-hour sit run-in period , complete 4 5-hour sitting protocol . The 3 sit interruption protocol include sit interruption different break frequency type allow evaluation effect sit-to-stand transition interruption type acute metabolism health outcome . All study protocol include baseline , mid-point , end-of-study bathroom break urine sample collection additional bathroom break allow need . During protocol multiple time point , blood sample collect assess change biomarkers glycemic regulation ( glucose insulin area curve ) mitochondrial function course sit protocol . During protocol multiple time point , change endothelial function , specifically , blood pressure ( indirect measure ) femoral flow-mediated dilation ( direct measure ) , assess . Changes measure compare protocol . A small aliquot ( 0.5mL ) plasma sample urine sample collect protocol bank possible ancillary , exploratory study . This study crossover design participant control . The investigator hypothesize frequent sit-to-stands 5-hour sit period result health benefit observe simple 2-minute stand interruption , associated improvement metabolism endothelial function . The investigator test hypothesis follow aim : Study Aim : Using randomize , control crossover study design , assess feasibility metabolic endothelial function outcome acute bout prolonged sit ± stand walk interruption use target metabolic endothelial function biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>
