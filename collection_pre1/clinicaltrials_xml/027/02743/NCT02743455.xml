The first two subject ( 1st sentinel group ) one clinical site randomize Group 2 3 vaccinated MVA-BN-YF without ISA 720 . Subjects study personnel blind whether ISA 720 administer . Subjects monitor safety one day , pre-defined halting rule meet ( Section 9.5.1 ) two additional subject ( 2nd sentinel group ) one clinical site assign group previous subject assign . These subject vaccinate monitor . A total 4 sentinel subject vaccinate . Primary objective assessment safety , tolerability , reactogenicity MVA-BN-YF vaccine administer without ISA 720 ; comparison safety , tolerability , reactogenicity MVA-BN-YF vaccine administer without ISA 720 YF-VAX MVA-BN . Secondary objective : assessment immunogenicity MVA-BN backbone Yellow Fever virus ( YF ) antigen insert MVA-BN-YF without ISA 720 assess kinetics immune response , seroconversion rate , peak Geometric Mean Titer ( GMT ) ; assessment impact previous MVA-BN vaccination peak immune response YF antigen MVA-BN-YF ; comparison peak immunogenicity YF antigen 1 2 dos MVA-BN-YF without ISA 720 YF-VAX ; comparison peak immunogenicity MVA-BN backbone 1 2 dos MVA-BN-YF without ISA 720 MVA-BN ; assessment durability immune response YF antigen MVA-BN 6 month 2nd vaccination placebo administration .</detailed_description>
