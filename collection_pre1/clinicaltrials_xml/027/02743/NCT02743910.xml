	<brief_summary>This study do see possible use blood sample predict response treatment breast cancer patient receive preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) therapy . Research show breast cancer release tumor-specific DNA blood ( , DNA specific tumor cell cancer ) . This DNA detect blood test know plasma tumor-DNA `` ptDNA . '' This DNA separate find blood tissue sample serve `` instruction book '' `` genetic code '' cell make-up human body . The change ptDNA treatment , well surgery , may also help investigator understand patient 's risk cancer return long-term outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospectively design study . Up 229 newly diagnose invasive HER2-positive triple-negative breast cancer patient plan neoadjuvant therapy ( NAT ) enrol . Blood sample collect pre-operatively time diagnosis/prior NAT , post-cycle 1/pre-cycle 2 NAT , NAT/immediately surgery , post-operatively 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month , annually thereafter fund allows . Researchers also collect representative tissue sample diagnostic biopsy ( participant ) definitive surgery ( available ) . Additionally , look feasibility tumor DNA analyse urine sample , urine sample collect along blood sample ( urine tumor DNA utDNA ) . Next generation sequence perform core biopsy enrol patient tumor-specific mutation ( TSM ) discovery . Based finding , droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR ) plasma DNA sample also perform confirm presence TSM plasma diagnosis , one TSM chosen track plasma tumor DNA ( ptDNA ) mutation interest . Investigators perform ddPCR pre-operative plasma DNA sample assess presence ptDNA . Pathologists assess surgical specimen pathologic response ( complete response/pCR residual cancer burden/RCB ) . As primary endpoint , investigator assess number patient without preoperative ptDNA pCR versus residual disease . As exploratory endpoint , follow also perform : ( ) quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR ( QM-MSP ) diagnostic biopsy definitive residual surgery specimen ; , ( b ) circulating methylated tumor DNA ( cMethDNA ) assay plasma specimen ( baseline NAT ) , evaluate association pathologic response . Additional endpoint include association plasma tissue marker baseline , NAT , ( available ) surveillance long-term prognosis ( invasive disease-free survival/IDFS distant disease-free survival/DDFS ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnose , histologically confirm invasive breast cancer triple negative ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] , progesterone receptor [ PR ] , HER2neu negative ) HER2positive ( ER/PR status ) Unresected , untreated breast cancer T2 , T3 , T4ac ; N ( nodal status ) ; M0 ( metastatic ) ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Planning receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen contain taxane Â± anthracycline least 4 cycle . Patients HER2positive disease must also plan receive HER2targeted therapy . Diagnostic tumor material must available correlative analysis Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document No prior treatment current breast cancer , though prior use selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) prevention breast cancer acceptable . Women pregnant nursing exclude . No history another primary malignancy last 5 year prior registration . Patients prior history situ cancer basal localize squamous cell skin cancer eligible .</criteria>
