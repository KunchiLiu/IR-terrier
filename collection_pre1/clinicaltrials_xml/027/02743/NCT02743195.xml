	<brief_summary>The gastrointestinal ( GI ) ecosystem complex network bacterial cell , host cell tissue change age . Fewer number less diversity beneficial bacteria great number diversity non-beneficial bacteria occur age condition associate accelerated aging ( i.e . obesity , high fat diet ) ( 1,2 ) . This imbalance microbiota contributes increase inflammation gastrointestinal lining change integrity intestinal cell wall . Prebiotics , non-digestible carbohydrate , induce growth activity microorganisms contribute well-being host . Recent study show prebiotic treatment beneficial effect glucose level , lipid metabolism , inflammatory marker obese population ( 3 ) . The polyphenol blend rich anthocyanins , unique subgroup flavonoid demonstrate impact microbiome anti-inflammatory property ( 4,5,6,7 ) . This open-label study ass benefit prebiotic polyphenol blend healthy obese adult .</brief_summary>
