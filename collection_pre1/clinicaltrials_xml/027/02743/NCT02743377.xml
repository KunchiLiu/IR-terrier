	<brief_summary>Background : McCune-Albright Syndrome ( MAS ) disorder affect bone , skin , hormone-producing tissue . It associate mutation gene . This gene affect enzymes brain body . Researchers want learn one enzymes , Phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) , people MAS . Objective : To see people MAS high level PDE4 people without MAS . Eligibility : People age 18 old MAS participate protocol 98-D-0145 , Screening Natural History Patients Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune-Albright Syndrome . Healthy adult volunteer also need . Design : This study require 1 4 outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center . Some visit may take place day . Participants MAS screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test . Participants magnetic resonance imaging scan . Participants full body positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . A small amount radioactive chemical , [ 11C ] ( R ) -rolipram , give intravenous tube . Participants brain PET scan [ 11C ] ( R ) -rolipram . For , thin plastic tube also put artery wrist elbow crease area . For scan , participant lie bed slide scanner . They may wear plastic mask hold head place . They blood drawn . Participants MAS interview think mood . They may complete questionnaire feel think .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Imaging Phosphodiesterase-4 ( PDE4 ) Brain Peripheral Organs McCune-Albright Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : McCune-Albright syndrome ( MAS ) mosaic disease arise early embryonic somatic activating mutation GNAS , encode 3 &lt; = , 5 &lt; =-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) pathway-associated G-protein , Gs . Constitutive activation Gs lead increase cAMP signal brain , well peripheral organ , particularly bone . Although subject MAS show psychiatric neurological symptom , study attempt assess brain change individual . This protocol seek study change cAMP cascade brain peripheral organ individual MAS use [ 11C ] ( R ) -rolipram PET , bind phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) reflect cAMP cascade activity . Study population : Participants include 20 subject MAS 15 healthy subject group-matched MAS subject age gender . Both MAS subject healthy control one two PET scan : one whole body one brain scan . We expect 10 brain 10 whole body scan perform group . Design : Subjects MAS recruit participant 98-D-0145 Screening Natural History Patients Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune-Albright Syndrome ( PI : Michael T. Collins , MD ) . Only participant protocol ( 98-D-0145 ) provide self-consent without legally authorize representative recruit . Brain PET scan perform measure metabolite-corrected arterial input function . No blood sample perform whole body scan . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure obtain brain scan amount radioligand binding quantified distribution volume ( Vt ) . Calculated brain plasma data , Vt reflect rolipram bind PDE4 , correct individual difference metabolism radioligand regional blood flow brain . The secondary outcome measure obtain whole body scan area curve ( AUC ) radioactivity express standard uptake value ( SUV ) . SUV calculate normalizing radioactivity PET image injection activity body weight . Vt brain compare subject MAS healthy control . AUC compare within-subjects MAS area craniofacial fibrous dysplasia adjacent unaffected bone . AUC whole body scan also compare subject MAS healthy control . We hypothesize subject MAS show great rolipram binding healthy control brain region , well great rolipram uptake bone affect fibrous dysplasia unaffected bone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects MAS : At least 18 year age Able provide selfconsent Diagnosed MAS 98D0145 . Have craniofacial fibrous dysplasia neuropsychological symptom Healthy Subjects : At least 18 year age . Healthy base medical history physical examination . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects MAS : Serious medical condition , may interfere study procedure . Such condition include limited significant bone abnormality wrist area arm , make difficult place radial arterial line , clinically mark dysfunction liver kidney , may delay clearance [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) rolipram . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality link endocrine abnormality may interfere PET measurement affect safety participant study . Positive HIV test . Head trauma result period unconsciousness lasting longer one hour . Metallic foreign body would affect magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnet , fear enclose space likely make subject unable undergo MRI scan . Recent researchrelated exposure radiation ( i.e. , PET research ) , combine study , would allowable limit . Inability lie flat camera bed two half hour . Pregnancy breastfeed . Current substance use disorder base DSM5 . NIMH employees/staff immediate family member exclude study per NIMH policy . Healthy Subjects : Serious medical condition , may interfere study procedure . Such condition include limit clinically mark dysfunction liver kidney , may delay clearance [ ( 11 ) C ] ( R ) rolipram . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality may interfere PET measurement affect safety participant study . Personal history DSM5 diagnose Axis I disorder . Positive HIV test . Head trauma result period unconsciousness lasting longer one hour . Metallic foreign body would affect MRI magnet , fear enclose space likely make subject unable undergo MRI scan . Recent researchrelated exposure radiation ( i.e. , PET research ) , combine study , would allowable limit . Inability lie flat camera bed two half hour . Pregnancy breastfeed .
