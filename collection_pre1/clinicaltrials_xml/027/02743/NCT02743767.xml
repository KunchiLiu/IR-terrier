After first detection cause airway complication general anaesthesia investigator initiate five different intervention airway management , : immediate bag-valve mask ventilation administer muscle relaxant , optimize preoxygenation , introduce preinterventional checklist , increase usage video laryngoscopy immediate change provider case fail intubation . In second phase observational study investigator want evaluate five intervention reduce minor major airway complication general anaesthesia . Additionally , investigator want record many critical incident ( CIRS ) occur observational period many report involved stuff .</brief_summary>
