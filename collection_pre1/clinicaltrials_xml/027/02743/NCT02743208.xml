	<brief_summary>In recent year , short femoral stem introduce . Short stem design base traditional stem good clinical result . The assumed benefit short stem easy use mini-invasive surgery , preservation proximal periprosthetic bone stock well . Preservation periprosthetic bone proximal femur think secure long time anchor implant , reduce risk loosening . In addition , good proximal bone stock make later revision surgery less technically demand . However , short stem design could compromise stability prosthesis , report diverging result regard correct position short stem . This may due lack inherent aim provide tip traditional long stem . We want clinically evaluate stability bone remodelling pattern new short femoral stem base standard stem excellent long time result . In addition compare two different stem regard positioning , use newly develop guide broach short stem , standard broach long stem . Finally , patient report clinical outcome score evaluate respect implant biomechanical reconstruction . The aim study evaluate whether specific short femoral stem stable , safe use , provide expect beneficial effect bone remodelling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Short Femoral Stem Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) successful treatment osteoarthritis destructive disease hip joint , relieve pain restore function joint . In Norway 7000 patient undergo primary hip replacement every year , incidence increase . The femoral component hip prosthesis traditionally anchor femoral bone stem introduce femoral canal fixate cement , bony ingrowth . Over recent year , short femoral stem introduce , among reason meet increase popularity mini-invasive surgical procedure . The short stem mean easy introduce small incision like use muscle conserve anterior posterior approach . Secondly , biomechanically relevant , important design related benefit short femoral stem think prevent periprosthetic bone resorption . Bone remodels response mechanical loading . When stiff implant insert femoral canal , load `` bypass '' proximal femur implant , transfer bone distally . This result negative bone remodelling proximal femur , lead bone resorption , often term `` stress shielding '' . Stress shield observe around uncemented implant , mainly occur within first 6 - 24 month postoperatively . The extent implant coating , material stiffness , design size stem find influence degree stress shielding . The short stem thus design base theory proximal load transfer preserve metaphyseal bone . Loss proximal bone stock due stress shield controversial subject , several possible consequence . The exact clinical implication entirely determine , periprosthetic fracture challenge revision surgery recognize problem . In revision set favourable good proximal bone stock achieve primary stability implant . Peroperative fracture compromise stability implant may potential problem stress-shielded bone . Furthermore , already stress-shielded bone proximal femur may give wear debris easy access interface implant bone , result osteolysis . Short-term result short-stemmed implant encourage clinical paper , available implant lack long-time clinical documentation . Most paper stress shield randomize trial long short stem . There report increase revision rate challenge surgical procedure . Uncemented prosthetic hip implant dependent excellent primary stability achieve osseointegration long-term stability . It recognize excessive micromotion bone-implant interface associate formation soft tissue loosen implant . Micromotion 40μm lead partial bone ingrowth , value 150μm completely inhibit bone ingrowth . The main concern short femoral stem stability might compromise . This might due relatively less contact surface . There long term result stability short femoral stem available , vitro study show significant reduction stability prostheses comparable stem length Furlong Evolution . Malpositioning may result discrepancy reconstruct native biomechanical anatomy hip . Altered biomechanical property may influence clinical outcome survival implant . It show horizontal femoral offset , increase significantly use short femoral stem compare conventional femoral stem . Compared contralateral hip , horizontal femoral offset significantly increase use short stem . Increased femoral offset increase torsion force along stem , turn raise need primary stability avoid micromotion . It also show short stem wide range varus-valgus stem-shaft axis , On find significant difference biomechanical reconstruction hip use `` broach '' short stem , `` ream broach '' standard stem . If significant difference biomechanical hip reconstruction , affect patient report outcome ?</detailed_description>
