	<brief_title>Comparison Vonoprazan Esomeprazole Participants With Symptomatic GERD Who Responded Partially High Dose Proton Pump Inhibitor ( PPI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vonoprazan . Vonoprazan test treat people symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) partial response treatment high dose esomeprazole . This study look improvement heartburn symptoms participant take vonoprazan compare esomeprazole . The study enroll approximately 213 patient . All participant receive esomeprazole esomeprazole placebo-matching capsule ( capsule look like esomeprazole active ingredient ) 7-week run-in period . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one three treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Vonoprazan 20 mg - Vonoprazan 40 mg - Esomeprazole 40 mg All participant ask take one capsule time day throughout study . All participant ask record heartburn symptom diary every morning upon wake every evening go sleep . This multi-center trial conduct Europe . The overall time participate study 12 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic , contact telephone 1 week last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
