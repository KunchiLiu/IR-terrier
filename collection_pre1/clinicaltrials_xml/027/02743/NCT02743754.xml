	<brief_summary>Kidney injury serious complication cardiac surgery occur 30 % patient increase risk adverse outcome . Kidney injury initiate oxygen supply kidney drop level need normal cellular function , cause tissue oxygen deficiency ( hypoxia ) , activation inflammatory cascade , oxidative stress . Together , event impair tissue oxygenation , culminate impaired kidney function due cellular injury death . There effective therapy kidney injury cardiac surgery , evidence recovery possible process injury - i.e. , impaired oxygen delivery , increase inflammatory response , oxidative stress - ameliorate soon onset injury . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) - entails intermittent inhalation 100 % oxygen hyperbaric chamber pressure high one absolute atmosphere ( &gt; 760 mmHg ) - show positively affect process ( i.e. , improve tissue oxygenation , reduce inflammation , reduce oxidative stress ) . Thus , hypothesize HBOT reduce severity kidney injury cardiac surgery initiate soon onset injury . This hypothesis test human , support animal study . In first-in-human , unblinded , control pilot trial , 20 adult patient develop severe kidney injury soon cardiac surgery randomize ( obtain inform consent patient surrogate ) standard-of-care early HBOT . Severe kidney injury define ≥30 % drop kidney function within 6 hour surgery ( determined change creatinine surgery Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission ) . This degree injury occur ~ 2 % patient associate 12-fold increase risk complete kidney failure ( require dialysis ) death . Patients exclude relative absolute contraindication HBOT ( e.g. , severe ventricular dysfunction , ventricular assist device , severe respiratory dysfunction , pneumothorax , bronchospasm ) .</brief_summary>
