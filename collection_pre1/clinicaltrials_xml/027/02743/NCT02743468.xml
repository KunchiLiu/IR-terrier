	<brief_summary>Background : Respiratory disease affect 1 billion people worldwide . They grow public health concern . The lung constantly expose environmental factor dust , fume , microbe , pollutant . But much still know pollutant lead respiratory illness . Researchers want collect sample lung blood see genetics environmental pollutant affect cellular response function . Objectives : To study cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway enzyme affect macrophage function lung inflammatory response . Eligibility : Adults age 18 60 bronchoscopy . Design : All study visit take place NIEHS Clinical Research Unit Research Triangle Park , NC . At study visit 1 , participant screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test . They take test measure lung function . They answer questionnaire . Before visit , give list medicine take . They also must caffeine day visit . The visit last 3 hour . At study visit 2 , participant give blood sample . They undergo bronchoscopy . For , get intravenous line vein get sedative . Their airway numb . Cells collect lung . They fast 8 hour visit . They must someone else drive home visit . The visit last 3-4 hour . Participants get follow-up phone call 1 day study visit 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , cross-sectional study design provide consistent method obtain biological sample respiratory health-related information participant use research evaluate lung function ( e.g. , responses environmental agent air pollution particle , engineer nanomaterials , immune ligand ; role genetics cellular response function ) . Study participant adult volunteer , age 18-60 ( inclusive ) , meet eligibility criterion undergo bronchoscopy . Potential participant prescreened schedule final eligibility visit include medical history review , vital sign , physical examination , blood draw , pulmonary function test . After eligibility confirm , participant schedule biological sample collection , include blood draw bronchoscopy . The objective protocol investigate role cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) epoxygenase pathway enzyme , include soluble epoxide hydrolase ( sEH ; encode EPHX2 ) CYP2J2 proteins , macrophage function inflammatory response . The primary outcome measure evaluate macrophage phagocytosis ex vivo assay , compare group individual without EPHX2 CYP2J2 polymorphisms interest . Secondary outcome include evaluation ex vivo gene expression inflammatory receptor cytokine stimulate macrophage ( alveolar peripheral blood monocyte-derived ) , assessment low airway microbiome bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid , measurement eicosanoids cytokine serum BAL fluid .</detailed_description>
