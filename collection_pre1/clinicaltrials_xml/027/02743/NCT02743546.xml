	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity study drug know participant study staff ) , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , Phase 1b study . The purpose study see duvortuxizumab combination ibrutinib safe useful treat participant B-cell malignancy . This study conduct 2 part : Part 1 : Dose Optimization Part 2 : Dose Expansion . Part 1 determine dose duvortuxizumab give safely standard dose ibrutinib participant previously treat B-cell malignancy . Part 2 look previously treat DLBCL , FL , MCL , CLL participant respond safe dose duvortuxizumab combination ibrutinib . Part 2 also test whether dose Part 1 effective cancer therapy . The study consist Screening Phase , ibrutinib Run-In Phase ( Part 2 ) , combination ( duvortuxizumab plus ibrutinib ) Treatment Phase ( Day 1 , Cycle 1 continue completion End-of-Treatment Visit ) , End-of-Treatment Visit ( 30 day ( +7 day ) last dose study drug ) , Post-treatment Follow-up Phase . The end study define 12 month last participant receive first dose study treatment . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
