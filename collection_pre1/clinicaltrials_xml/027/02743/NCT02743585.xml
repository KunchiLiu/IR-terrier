	<brief_summary>Septic shock carry high mortality , may exacerbate inappropriate initial therapy . Inappropriate therapy may result unanticipated antimicrobial resistance . Conversely , positive blood culture may result contamination , lead unnecessary therapy procedure possibly prolong hospitalization . Clinicians may also resort broad spectrum antimicrobial hesitant de-escalate await susceptibility result . The investigator hypothesize rapid identification pathogens antimicrobial resistance ameliorate problem improve time optimal therapy , avoid unnecessary therapy ultimately improve patient outcome . While number in-vitro uncontrolled clinical study , paucity well-designed clinical trial objectively examine real-world clinical health-economic impact technology . To date one randomise trial perform US ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01898208 ) , set low endemic rate antimicrobial resistance . This companion study NCT01898208 . The investigator aim study clinical impact cost-effectiveness strategy rapid pathogen resistance detection set moderate high level antimicrobial resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Rapid Pathogen Identification From Blood Cultures ( RABbIT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : 1 . Rapid pathogen identification blood culture , include early identification resistance ( via specific genetic marker phenotypic test ) , allow timely initiation appropriate antibiotic therapy improve patient outcomes 2 . Rapid organism identification blood culture allow timely initiation effective optimal antibiotic therapy ; minimize use unnecessary antibiotic , include combination therapy Devices study propose study : 1 . BCID panel ( Biofire Diagnostics Inc. , bioMerieux ) : The BCID panel FDA-approved nucleic acid amplification test ( base nest polymerase chain reaction ) detect Gram positive , Gram negative , major Candida specie antimicrobial resistance marker ( mecA methicillin resistance , van A/B vancomycin resistance , blaKPC Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ( KPC ) ) directly positive blood culture &lt; 1 - 1.5 hour 2 . Rosco Diagnostica extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) carbapenemase screen kit ( Rosco Diagnostica ) : These kit CE-marked ( Approved European Union ) rapid chromogenic test ESBL/ carbapenemase detection blood culture culture bacterial colony .</detailed_description>
