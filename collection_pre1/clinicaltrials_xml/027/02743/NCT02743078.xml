	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis glioblastoma grade IV malignant glioma ( include variant glioblastoma i.e. , gliosarcoma , giant cell glioblastoma , etc. ) . Confirmation tumor recurrence progression contrast MRI ( without gadolinium contrast ) determine RANO criterion within 14 day prior registration patient recent resection glioblastoma stereotactic biopsy . Patients undergone recent resection ( within 5 week prior registration ) glioblastoma treat current recurrence prior study treatment must recover effect surgery ( include patient 's skin fully recover surgical wound ) Note : 4week window require surgery prior start treatment . For CNSrelated stereotactic biopsy , minimum 7 day must elapse prior registration . Residual disease recurrent glioblastoma mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , postoperative MRI scan must perform prior registration recommend within 96 hour postsurgery ( although 2448 hour would optimum ) . Note : Patients surgery postoperative contrastenhanced scan fall outside 5week window prior registration , must repeat MRI scan within 14 day prior registration . Patients two recurrence allow . Failure bevacizumab ( either monotherapy combination ) recent regimen confirm tumor recurrence MRI . The patient must fail one regimen bevacizumab . The patient must receive bevacizumab upfront treatment newly diagnose glioblastoma . There must minimum 14 day ( i.e. , interval equal great 14 day ) since last treatment bevacizumab registration History/physical examination within 14 day prior registration Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 within 14 day prior registration Age ≥ 22 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000 cells/mm3 Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dl acceptable . ) Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Urine protein : creatinine ( UPC ) ratio &lt; 1.0 within 14 day prior registration OR urine dipstick proteinuria ≤ 2+ ( patient discover &gt; 2+ proteinuria dipstick urinalysis baseline must UPC ratio do &lt; 1.0 eligible . If UPC ratio ≥ 1.0 patient undergo 24hour urine collection must demonstrate ≤ 1g protein 24 hour eligible ) . *Note : UPC ratio spot urine estimation 24hour urine protein excretion ; UPC ratio 1 roughly equivalent 24hour urine protein 1 gm . UPC ratio calculate use one follow formula : [ urine protein ] / [ urine creatinine ] : protein creatinine report mg/dL [ ( urine protein ) x0.088 ] / [ urine creatinine ] : urine creatinine report mmol/L Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) within 14 day prior registration ALT AST ≤ 3.0 x ULN within 14 day prior registration Patients full dose anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin LMW heparin ) must meet following criterion : 1 . No active bleeding pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g. , tumor involve major vessel know varix ) within 14 day prior registration 2 . One criterion must meet base patient 's therapy : 1 . Warfarin : Inrange INR ( usually 2 3 ) within 14 day prior registration 2 . Low molecular weight heparin Novel oral anticoagulant : stable dose within 14 day prior registration Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy time registration follow : 28 day administration investigational agent 28 day administration prior cytotoxic therapy follow exception : 14 day administration vincristine irinotecan 42 day administration nitrosoureas 21 day administration procarbazine 7 day administration noncytotoxic agent [ e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) ] Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior registration . Patient must maintain stable decrease dose corticosteroid least 5 day baseline scan . Minimum interval since completion radiation treatment time registration 90 day . Patient must provide study specific informed consent prior study entry . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3 year . ( For example , carcinoma situ breast , oral cavity , cervix permissible ) . Infratentorial tumor . &gt; 1 cm diameter blood see contrast MRI ( without gadolinium contrast ) Major surgery intrathoracic , intraabdominal intrapelvic ( exception craniotomy ) , open biopsy significant traumatic injury ≤ 4 week prior registration , patient minor procedure , percutaneous biopsy placement vascular access device ≤ 1 week prior registration , recover side effect procedure injury . Implanted pacemaker , defibrillator deep brain stimulator , implant electronic device brain . Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month prior registration . Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month prior registration Cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within last 6 month prior registration Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) within last 6 month prior registration Uncontrolled hypertension ( define SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg DBP ≥ 100 mm Hg antihypertensive medication ) within 14 day prior registration . Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration . Chronic lung disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration . Severe hepatic disease , define diagnosis ChildPugh Class B C hepatic disease . Known HIV positive patient . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g . active uncontrolled infection , uncontrolled diabetes ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . Skull defect miss bone flap , shunt , bullet fragment . Significant intracranial pressure per treat physician may require surgical intervention . Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception . Breast feeding woman . Prior allergic reaction bevacizumab severe adverse event bevacizumab . Known sensitivity conductive hydrogel . Prior treatment Optune® system . Active treatment another clinical trial .</criteria>
