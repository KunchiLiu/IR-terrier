	<brief_summary>Purpose : Cancer associate intravascular coagulopathy primary mechanism cancer-related stroke , particularly without conventional stroke etiology . Randomized clinical trial investigate efficacy vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant ( warfarin ) , low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant ( NOAC ) prevention systematic venous thromboembolism . However , relatively little known biological change underlie intravascular coagulopathy mechanism anticoagulation therapy patient cancer-related stroke . The aim study evaluate determine biological marker intravascular coagulopathy cause stroke monitoring effect anticoagulation therapy , patient active cancer stroke .</brief_summary>
