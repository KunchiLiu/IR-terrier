	<brief_title>Effectiveness Respiratory Physiotherapy Children With Neuromuscular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Many author demonstrate efficacy Physiotherapy Respiratory attend respiratory difficulty associate different type pathology ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , cystic fibrosis , tumor ) , however investigator find study scientific evidence demonstrate effectiveness program child Neuromuscular Diseases ( NMD ) , whose quality life expectancy depend largely proper handle Bronchial secretion delay deterioration respiratory function . The main objective study focus determine effectiveness physiotherapy treatment respiratory breathe difficulty child NMD . Deducing aspect impact program number visit hospital emergency department year , hospital admission respiratory infection suffer child , need antibiotic . Material method : This research analytical , longitudinal , prospective , experimental , evaluator blind study . It control two parallel group , randomize clinical trial . The sample consist child diagnose NMD . For evolution different variable spirometric test use variable related function respiratory , track sheet design researcher collect number hospital emergency visit year , well hospital admission , respiratory infection need antibiotic . These assessment make start program every four month . Patients randomize control experimental group , apply Respiratory Physical Therapy treatment subject first group perform Respiratory Physical Therapy program second . This program carry week physiotherapist , four time weekly home , family , one year .</detailed_description>
