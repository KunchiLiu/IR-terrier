	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize spatial analysis location data ambulance call improve prehospital care provide Aman Foundation Karachi , Pakistan decrease ambulance response time high acuity patient . In Aim 1 , investigator develop conceptual framework prehospital care low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) anchor project Aims 2 3 . In Aim 2 , investigator analyze location call identify geographic area delay response patient high severity illness . As part quality assurance/quality improvement practice , Aman Foundation routinely collect location data GPS device ambulances call . Based analysis Aim 2 , Aim 3 investigator position ambulance cluster delay ambulance call high acuity patient improve response time . This period compare previous , control period analyze identify possible new cluster .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The list top cause death lose disability-adjusted life-years ( DALYs ) globally include many condition initially present emergency set . These top cause include low respiratory infection , ischemic heart disease , acute injury . The morbidity mortality result cause minimized emergency treatment . A key element reduce morbidity mortality acute illness time patient transport medical facility , clearly demonstrate acute injury . Low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) shoulder disproportionate burden acute illness , yet also demonstrate reduced transport time hospital decrease odds mortality trauma patient LMICs . A lack equipment , poorly developed infrastructure , long distance report key barrier provision emergency care . Pakistan one LMIC burden many challenge prehospital care . Emergency medical system ( EMS ) recently establish Pakistan , prior last several year , patient routinely transport healthcare facility relatives , bystander , basic patient transport . Where formal patient transport available , transport time often prolong distance , traffic congestion , lack public cooperation . Geographic information system ( GIS ) analytic method may serve key tool decrease time transport acutely ill patient life-saving medical care . GIS , link geographic information public health data , use simulation decrease ambulance response time show decrease response time industrialized country . However , replicate highly developed country never demonstrate LMIC . The investigator hypothesize spatial analysis location data ambulance call improve prehospital care provide Aman Health Care Services Karachi , Pakistan decrease ambulance response time high acuity patient . Aim 1 : Develop conceptual framework prehospital care LMICs . As framework currently exist literature , investigator develop conceptual framework anchor project Aims 2 3 . The framework develop consideration relate health system frameworks literature . The investigator also consult expert field partner Karachi comment framework improve . Aim 2 : Analyze location call identify geographic area longer call high severity illness . Using GIS spatial analysis , investigator analyze Aman Ambulance 's exist data ambulance call find area Karachi routinely long response time . Aim 3 : Position ambulance cluster delay ambulance call high acuity patient improve response time . Over six-month period , ambulance reposition around cluster delay improve response time . This period compare calendar period previous year use logistic regression analysis determine decrease delay ambulance response . Spatial analysis also perform data intervention period assess presence cluster delay . This study potential use sustainable method analyze routinely collect data ambulance call shorten time patient acute illness receive appropriate medical care Pakistan , set substantial infrastructure human resource challenge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aman Foundation use The Medical Priority Dispatch System ( MPDS ) , commonly use fivetier triage system include follow category ( least acute ) `` alpha , '' `` bravo , '' `` charlie , '' `` delta , '' `` echo . '' For analysis Aim 2 Aim 3 , examine call `` delta '' `` echo '' patient . Ambulance call transport patient one healthcare facility another call patient refuse transport exclude analysis .</criteria>
