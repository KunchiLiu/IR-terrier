	<detailed_description>Background Significance Perinatal stroke affect than1 2,300 live birth . Perinatal stroke common cause hemiparetic cerebral palsy ( CP ) . Even prompt behavioral therapy , ongoing significant residual motor impairment common child . In case , innovative intervention take advantage early critical window optimize outcome urgently neededâ€”in infancy . Thus , understand early brain reorganization brain yet largely reorganized critical develop efficacious early intervention . Current pediatric study employ non-invasive brain stimulation , commonly use single paired-pulses Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) evaluate brain plasticity assess cortical excitability . To date , one infant study use TMS assess cortical excitability perinatal stroke . As unique aspect investigation , study combine Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) / Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) TMS provide additional opportunity assess cortical excitability corticospinal tract ( CST ) integrity infant perinatal stroke . Identifying association laboratory assessment result developmental outcome also critical . The General Movements Assessment ( GMA ) quick non-invasive way evaluate motor performance predict CP high-risk infant 20 week age ( correct age preterm infant ) . Thus , purpose study use MRI/DTI TMS comprehensively examine CST integrity cortical excitability infant follow perinatal stroke , identify association motor outcome evaluate GMA . Specific Aims/Study Objectives Aim 1 : Use TMS index maladaptive cortical reorganization assess relative excitability corticospinal projection hemisphere upper extremity musculature 3 5 month old infant confirm diagnosis perinatal stroke . Hypothesis : The ipsilesional hemisphere small `` map volume '' ( low cortical excitability ) contralesional hemisphere ( large map volume ) . Aim 2 : Index maladaptive cortical reorganization evaluate organizational integrity CSTs bilaterally via fractional anisotropy ( FA ) , standardize metric derive DTI , infant perinatal stroke . Hypothesis 1 : Ipsilesional CST low value FA contralesional CST . Hypothesis 2 : Smaller cortical excitability volume associate low value FA . Aim 3 : For infant perinatal stroke , examine relationship movement quality derive GMA cortical excitability CST integrity . Hypothesis : Atypical GMA outcome score associate low FA value lower ipsilesional CST excitability . Aim 4 : Record feasibility issue arise , monitor adverse event TMS cortical mapping MRI scan infant perinatal stroke . Hypothesis 1 : TMS MRI assessments infant perinatal stroke feasible . Hypothesis 2 : No seizure serious adverse event relate TMS MRI/DTI occur study .
