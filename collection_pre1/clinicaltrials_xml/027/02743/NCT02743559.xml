	<brief_summary>Fractures child common incidence increase . They common child small , narrow weak bone . Studies show fracture early childhood associate later bone strength . There several ( ) non-modifiable ( age , gender , race , genetics ) ( ii ) modifiable factor nutrition ( vitamin D &amp; calcium intake ) exercise contribute bone strength . Low calcium associate increase risk fracture . Vitamin D play pivotal role bone health increase absorption calcium gut . Investigators know previous research reduction bone strength child whose mother low vitamin D level pregnancy . Bone growth also achieve load bone childhood form regular sport activity gymnastics exercise programme . Equally achieve use whole body vibration ( WBV ) . WBV application vibratory stimulus body synchronous fashion bone make much strong reduce risk fracture later life . Thus WBV use mean assess bone responsiveness mechanical stimulation . Studies show stand vibrate platform 10 minute day significantly increase bone mass . Investigators ' research also show healthy boy make stand vibration platform 10 minute daily 5 day increase strength quality bone . Thus role diet mechanical loading considerable interest determine role bone health prevention fracture . Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study ( MAVIDOS ) large study conduct recently 3 different big centre ( Sheffield , Southampton Oxford ) . Results study show give high dose vitamin D pregnant woman every day 14 week pregnancy increase strength bone infant . In proposed study Investigators aim show vitamin D supplementation pregnancy affect response bone vibration child whose mother participate MAVIDOS study Sheffield . These child 4 year age participate study . The result study help inform public health policy vitamin D intake pregnancy . This also help investigator identify possible risk factor poor bone health child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Vitamin D Alter Bone 's Response Vibration ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aim determine whether antenatal vitamin D supplementation alters postnatal bone formation response mechanical stimulation . The skeleton respond mechanical stimulation increase bone size mass increment persist adult life may lower risk osteoporosis ( Daly , &amp; Bass , 2009 ) . In contrast , without mechanical stimulation , bone lose . Cells within bone - osteoblast osteoclasts - involve removal formation bone ; biomarkers Pro-collagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide ( PINP ) C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide type I collagen ( CTx ) surrogates respective tissue level activity . Whole body vibration ( WBV ) use one method deliver mechanical stimulation adult child . The investigator recently show healthy boy age 9-11 year , WBV experience 10 minute daily five day increase P1NP 25 % CTx 11 % ( Harrison et al. , 2015 ) . The investigator undertake another study recently determine effect reduce vitamin D intake pregnancy early life skeleton 's response mechanical loading use mouse model . Our unpublished data show antenatal vitamin D depletion substantially reduce loading-dependent increase cortical trabecular bone mass offspring mouse close skeletal maturity . The available human mouse data suggest antenatal vitamin D deficiency way influence bone become less responsive mechanical stimulation . The investigator ready explore human , assess responsiveness skeleton mechanical stimulation use WBV child expose high level vitamin D in-utero maternal supplementation vitamin D. Through study investigator able determine whether in-utero environment modify easily improve skeletal responsiveness activity improve skeletal health short long term .</detailed_description>
