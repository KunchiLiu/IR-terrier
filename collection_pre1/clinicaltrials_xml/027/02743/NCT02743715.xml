	<brief_summary>Neuromodulation technique treatment Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) expand great understand brain circuit involve disorder . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive neuromodulation technique study alternative strategy treatment-resistant OCD . The main study randomize , sham-controlled , double-blinded trial tDCS OCD patient unresponsive cognitive-behavioral therapy and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . Forty-four patient randomize two group : active simulate intervention . The intervention consist deliver electric current 2mA cathode , position bilaterally cranial region correspond supplementary motor cortex , anode position deltoid ( neutral region ) , 30-minutes , four consecutive week . The primary outcome reduction baseline YBOCS score tDCS treatment . Secondary outcome include measure depressive anxiety symptom , genetic marker , motor cortical excitability performance neurocognitive test .</brief_summary>
