	<detailed_description>Open-labelled pilot clinical trial Zepatier ( MK-5172 MK-8742/Grazoprevir + Elbasvir ) 10 HCV-negative subject end-stage renal disease receive kidney transplant HCV-positive donor . Eligible subject receive kidney transplant deceased-donor genotype 1 HCV , receive 12 week Zepatier kidney transplantation infection HCV confirm kidney transplant recipient .

To deem eligible liver transplant Penn , patient ( study subject ) must adequate cardiac function must examine hepatologist liver transplant surgeon . These two requirement represent major difference evaluation process kidney liver transplant .
