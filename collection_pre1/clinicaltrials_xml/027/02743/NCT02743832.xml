	<brief_title>A Study Tumor Budding Guiding Individualized Surgical Planning Early-stage Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral squamous cell carcinoma common malignant tumor oral maxillofacial region , prone early cervical lymph node metastasis . Lymphatic spread associate increase risk loco-regional recurrence , therefore , identification lymph node metastases preoperatively important optimal surgical therapy . Recently , cervical lymph node dissection ( CLND ) perform presence oral squamous cell carcinoma . However , whether cervical lymph node dissection necessarily perform presence early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma still controversial . CLND represent over-treatment case early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma . Therefore , How accurately predict whether patient perform CLND important . Our previous study show tumor bud closely relate lymphatic spread oral squamous cell carcinoma . The purpose study find whether tumor bud guide individualized surgical plan early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma .</detailed_description>
