	<brief_summary>Phase II study evaluate benefit combination anti-PD1 ( pembrolizumab ) anti-CTLA4 ( ipilimumab ) antibody advance melanoma . The study determine response rate combination evaluate clinical parameter progression-free survival safety combination follow anti-PD1/L1 antibody . The study also provide opportunity investigate blood tumor base factor may predict response anti-PD1 antibody combination anti-CTLA4 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Pembrolizumab Ipilimumab Following Initial Anti-PD1/L1 Antibody</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To determine irRECIST* response rate pembrolizumab ipilimumab follow initial progression stable disease anti-PD1/L1 antibody ( combination contain anti-CTLA4 ) subject advance melanoma . Secondary Objective 1 . To summarize progression-free survival ( RECIST v1.1 irRC ) combination follow prior treatment anti-PD1/L1 antibody . 2 . To assess safety combination follow prior treatment anti-PD1/L1 antibody . Exploratory Objective : To evaluate change tumor microenvironment biospecimens add ipilimumab pembrolizumab .</detailed_description>
