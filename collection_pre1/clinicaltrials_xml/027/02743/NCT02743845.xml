	<brief_summary>The Gene Discovery Core The Manton Center Orphan Disease Research base Boston Children 's Hospital study family rare , poorly understood undiagnosed , suspected genetic condition . The primary goal research well understand gene protein ( gene product ) involve rare disease . The researcher hope study allow improve diagnosis treatment individual rare disease future . Individuals rare/undiagnosed condition eligible enroll . Enrollment include : - Providing DNA tissue sample ( available ) - Access participant ' medical record Samples use genetic analysis ( primarily exome genomce sequence ) identify genetic cause individual 's illness . Individual research result return family health care provider confirmation clinical lab . If cause identify , report back family health care provider study 's genetic counselor . When possible , investigator also collect sample parent full-siblings well affect family member .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants may recruit Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) off-site collaborators/healthcare provider determine participant eligible . Participants may also contact lab directly hear research individual , recruitment material , study 's website ( www.childrenshospital.org/mantoncenter ) . After consent participation , individual rare disorder suspect , unknown/poorly understood genetic basis , family member ask participate study provide 1 ) relevant medical information/records family history 2 ) blood/saliva/DNA/RNA sample , 3 ) preexist tissue sample ( include preexist prenatal sample ) longer need clinical care ( available ) future tissue sample specifically research purpose . The medical record family history allow investigator gain good understand specific disease symptom see individual family . The blood/saliva sample use obtain DNA and/or RNA , and/or biochemical analyze identifying genetic base disease pathophysiology use various approach include genomic sequencing . Tissue sample obtain individual participant employ well understand gene expression protein interaction investigation ( limit ) immunohistochemical microarray analysis . This study project ongoing indefinite period time , participation continuous unless individual request remove study . Participants request withdraw time . Active participation primarily take place time enrollment case-by-case basis thereafter provide clinical update and/or additional sample . Risks include associate routine blood draws/saliva sample collection emotional distress associate genetic and/or medical research . Risks minimize much possible open consent process privacy/confidentiality safeguard , include certificate confidentiality NIH use de-identified , numerical code refer participant collaborator . Although immediate , direct benefit participant , possible benefit study include development new diagnostic test detail prognostic information participant family . In addition , study may lead good understand pathophysiology condition , lead development treatment cure rare common disorder future .</detailed_description>
