	<brief_summary>The study ascertain ability preschool lung function test distinguish healthy child wheeze , differentiate phenotype wheezy child ( high low risk asthma define API ) order predict response therapy , explore correlation preschool lung function test result symptom , order develop objective method monitor asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Development Novel Clinical Tests Diagnose Monitor Asthma Preschool Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Canada , common chronic disease childhood asthma . Childhood asthma place significant burden health care system ( refn ) . No objective preschool asthma diagnostic tool exist , current gold-standard , Asthma Predictive Index , provide information lung function symptom management . In study , hypothesize lung clearance index ( LCI ) , value derive multiple breath washout test , sensitive , responsive discriminative test preschool asthma . If prof useful monitoring diagnosis preschool asthma , LCI potential improve clinical management thus potentially significantly reduce hospitalization rate preschool child suffer asthma . In unique data set , investigator also compare relative utility force oscillation technique ( FOT ) preschool spirometry LCI order detect abnormality amongst child high risk preschool asthma . In addition , impact sleep apnea risk factor modifier asthma investigate study . Furthermore , change composition nasal microbiome wheeze episode role viral infection wheeze exacerbation explore . Finally , utility new method diagnose food allergy , basophil activation test , examine Canadian cohort .</detailed_description>
