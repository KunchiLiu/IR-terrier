	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study test protocol investigate longer-term effect torso weight physical activity , number fall , muscle activation ( muscle turn intensely ) five volunteer multiple sclerosis . The hypothesis study include : torso weighting ( 1 ) increase physical activity , ( 2 ) decrease number fall , ( 3 ) improve time coordination muscle activation balance perturbation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Effects Torso-Weighting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Torso weighting , use balance-based torso-weighting ( BBTW ) method , intervention address balance first challenging stability stand use series perturbation ( nudge ) resist rotation people . Challenging stability allow assessor determine directional instability . Once direction instability determine , small weight place vest-like garment retesting balance occurs . In study , participant test weight ( NW ) , sham weight ( SW ) , BBTW weighting ( WT ) . Following non-weighted baseline assessment , participant randomly allocate sham weight condition BBTW weight condition cross-over design . The initial condition ( NW ) last four week final two condition ( SW , WT ) last two week . Following condition , outcome measure reassess . Throughout study , participant ask wear commercially-available remote monitoring device ( e.g. , Fitbit Flex ) keep daily log physical activity number fall . During SW WT condition , participant wear assigned garment 2-4 hour daily .</detailed_description>
