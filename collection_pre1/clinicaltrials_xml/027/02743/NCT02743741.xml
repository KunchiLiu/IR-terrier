	<brief_summary>This prospective single arm , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety Lutetium-177 Octreotate patient neuroendocrine tumor positive Somatostatin receptor identify 68Ga-DOTATATE . 195 patient enrol totally . Patient progress neuroendocrine tumor evaluate tumor board first eligible patient undergo diagnostic Ga 68 PET scan . Patients show Somatostatin undergo 4 cycle Lu-DOTATATE treatment . Dose adjustment Cycle 2-4 make base individualized dosimetry , well creatinine clearance hematological parameter . Patients evaluate progression free survival 12 month last dose . Patients negative somatostatin receive 68Ga-DOTATATE treatment follow progression act control group .</brief_summary>

Patients objective evidence ( image , biochemical ) insufficient classify RECIST 1.1 criterion eligible provincial multidisciplinary tumor board discussion consensus progression eligibility reach . The tumor board would consider exemption base clinical radiological factor . 5 . Adequate lab parameter within 2 week enrollment : Serum creatinine ≤ 150 µmol/L GFR ≥30 mL/min Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L WBC ≥ 2 x 10^9/L platelet ≥ 100 x 10^9/L 6 . Adequate liver function test within 2 week enrollment : total bilirubin ≤ 5 x ULN ALT ≤ 5 x ULN AST ≤ 5 x ULN alkaline phosphatase ) ≤ 5 x ULN 7 . Signed informed consent 8 . Patients extensive bone metastasis ( e.g . &gt; 25 % bone marrow involvement eligible require careful monitor hematological reserve 9 . Subject 's willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 1 . Life expectancy &lt; 12 week 2 . An option curative surgical medical therapy local liver embolization feasible 3 . Candidate curative and/or debulking surgical resection 4 . Systemic , biologic , radioisotope , embolization therapy within ≤12 week prior study enrollment . [ long act somatostatin analog octreotide LAR® eligible must switch short act patient confirm diagnostic phase eligible 177Lu withheld prior administration 177Lu ] . Somatostatin analog withhold least 24 hour prior radiopharmaceutical administration . It may resume 7 day . 5 . Prior radiotherapy target lesion ( ) within ≤12 week prior study enrollment [ radiotherapy nontarget lesion permit ] . 6 . Prior radiotherapy 25 % bone marrow . 7 . Known brain metastasis ( unless metastasis treat stable ≥ 6 month ) . 8 . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( fast glucose &gt; 12 mmol/L ) . 9 . Comorbidities may interfere delivery 177Lu ( e.g . urinary incontinence ) . 10 . Secondary active cancer ( ) clinical biochemical progression within last 3 year . 11 . Pregnancy breast feed . Female subject must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female subject reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum ) prior enrolment . Male subject must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate 12 . Other condition , illness , psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation , 68Ga 177Lu administration , may interfere interpretation study result judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
