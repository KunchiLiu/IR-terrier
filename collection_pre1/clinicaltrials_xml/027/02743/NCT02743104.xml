	<brief_title>Ketamine v Propofol Sedation During Pediatric Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric bronchoscopy require moderate deep sedation order maintain patient comfort safety , optimize work environment physician performing procedure . There paucity pediatric research field pediatric flexible bronchoscopy data often extrapolate adult study . Propofol often use sedation drug procedure due rapid sedative effect favorable emergence profile . Propofol 's major limitation tendency cause apnea , occur relatively narrow therapeutic window . Apnea risk decrease patient 's age administer physician 's familiarity experience drug . Ketamine drug often use pediatric procedural sedation . Its pharmacologic safety profile wide , allow wide spectrum dose significantly reduce risk apnea compare propofol . Known adverse effect drug include emergence profile may accompany hallucination , bronchorrhea laryngospasm . Hallucinations may prevent use benzodiazepine concurrently possibly pronounce teenaged child compare infant , although post-sedation irritability latter group might expression . Bronchorrhea , usually significant concern procedural sedation , potential play noteworthy role bronchoscopy . Significant airway secretion create difficult work environment pulmonologist perform procedure . Patient safety may also affect , increase airway secretion reduce visibility pediatric airway narrow begin compromise placement bronchoscope . Potentially , might also impact child 's air flow gas exchange . Laryngospasm procedure potentially hinders passage scope beyond vocal cord might extend duration procedure . In investigator ' center , propofol often sedative drug choice bronchoscopy . Yet , ketamine use time due safety profile administer physician level comfort drug . Aim : To compare operator satisfaction adverse effect child present flexible bronchoscopy use ketamine versus propofol primary sedative agent .</detailed_description>
