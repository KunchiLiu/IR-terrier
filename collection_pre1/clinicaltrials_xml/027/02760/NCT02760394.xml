	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Patients With Chronic Stable Ischemic Heart Disease : An Option Therapeutic Angiogenesis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic heart disease lead cause mortality United States second common Israel . Myocardial ischemia prevail imbalance oxygen demand delivery myocardium occur : due increase oxygen demand beyond deliver increased coronary flow ; due restriction blood flow obstruction stenosis coronary circulation face preserve oxygen demand ; combination process . There two main cause restrict blood supply myocardium : Epicardial atherosclerotic coronary disease dysfunctional coronary microcirculation . The two process often co-occurring patient give similarity risk factor underlie . As blood vessel fail deliver adequate resting maximal coronary blood flow , either gradually many year abruptly course acute event , myocardial segmental compromise thus , global cardiac function deteriorates . The functional hallmark ischemic leave ventricular ( LV ) segment inadequate contractility , manifest hypokinetic akinetic segment examine use either invasive non-invasive LV functional study . Ischemic myocardial cell may progress cellular death , irreversible scar formation . However , cell may maintain viability . These viable myocardial segment particular clinical importance give ability resume contractility adequate optimal medical therapy and/or revascularization optimization . Gate SPECT technology allow evaluation myocardial perfusion myocardial segmental viability patient chronic ischemic heart disease . Studies evaluate ability myocardial perfusion study predict clinical outcome contradictory many show ability predict morbidity mortality endpoint others n't . However , intuitively conceivable invasive non invasive approach able reduce ischemic burden determine myocardial perfusion imaging , important goal treatment patient chronic ischemic heart disease . Different standard invasive approach percutaneous coronary angioplasty ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) show increase myocardial perfusion serial study compare intervention . Furthermore , non invasive anti-anginal medication calcium channel blocker , beta blocker nitrate well statin show similarly produce improvement myocardial perfusion image combination treatment , require modern evidence-based guideline . It presume non-invasive approach either decrease myocardial oxygen demand ( e.g . Beta blocker ) increase coronary dilation ( e.g . Nitrates ) therapeutic mean contribute ischemia reduction . During past decade , concept `` therapeutic angiogenesis '' emerge observation significant number patient candidate standard revascularization procedure incomplete revascularization conventional procedure like PCI CABG . For example , patient two three vessel coronary artery disease , complete revascularization successful 23 % 9 % case , respectively one report . The goal therapeutic angiogenesis induction new coronary arterial vessel effectively provide blood supply area myocardium subtend diseased occluded native coronary artery . These `` native bypass '' vessel could relieve myocardial ischemia , improve regional global leave ventricular performance , lessen symptom angina , potentially improve patient prognosis . Candidates pharmacological stimulation therapeutic angiogenesis cardiac ischemia include angiogenic cytokine Fibroblast Growth Factors ( FGF ) , Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors ( VEGF ) , Hepatocyte Growth /Scatter Factor ( HGF/SF ) , CXC chemokines interleukin 8 ( IL8 ) monocytes chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) , growth factor involve maturation vascular tree angiopoietins Platelet Derived Growth Factor ( PDGF ) transcription factor stimulate expression angiogenic cytokine receptor Hypoxia-Induced Factor 1α ( HIF1α ) . Following promising result pre-clinical non-controlled study , several randomize placebo-controlled trial human , use candidate , show best , modest clinical endpoint improvement perfusion enhance capability . Although therapeutic angiogenesis use angiogenesis-enhancing factor active research arena , still infancy strategy yet achieve acceptance adjuvant therapy chronic ischemic heart disease . In study , hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) propose possible vivo angiogenic stimulator improve microvascular myocardial perfusion . Surprisingly , HBOT extensively evaluate patient chronic stable ischemic heart disease date , evaluation cardiovascular disease primarily context acute coronary syndrome , amelioration ischemic-reperfusion injury stem cell research . HBOT investigate treatment numerous diseases 300 year . The principal effect HBOT increase solubility oxygen plasma level sufficient support tissue minimal oxygen supply carry hemoglobin . Transport oxygen mitochondrion , main site oxygen utilization within individual cell , occur diffusion , via stepwise decrease drive oxygen pressure gradient . Diffusion oxygen gradient vector indicate direction great rate change oxygen dissolve blood oxygen within cell/entire tissue . As whole , breathe oxygen hyperbaric condition show potent mean increase arterial oxygen tension , well tissue oxygen tension . For example , 2 absolute atmosphere ( ATA ) , plasma O2 tension rise 1110 mmHg , whereas normal environmental condition , i.e . sea level , reach 98 mmHg . As concluded , hyperbaric condition provide ten-fold increase amount O2 reach hypoxic cardiac tissue . HBO therapy well tolerate consider safe use accord standard protocol , oxygen pressure exceed 3 ATA treatment session limit maximum 120 min . Multiple study suggest HBOT enhance angiogenesis demonstrate enhance myocardial perfusion ( presumably via therapeutic angiogenesis ) human , never attempt . The investigator hypothesize chronically ischemic viable myocardial tissue state chronic oxygen demand/delivery imbalance physiologic ischemia-induced angiogenesis regenerative/repair process , aim restore oxygen delivery , `` burn '' . Since regenerative/repair process common denominator : energy/oxygen dependent , might possible HBOT enable metabolic change need reignite regeneration process , simply supply miss energy/oxygen . Method : After sign informed consent , patient randomize 1:1 manner treat control-cross group . After randomization , patient invite baseline evaluation include full review medical status complete physical examination . Patients instruct refrain change chronic medication life style ( e.g . exercise regimen ) avoid new medication unless clinically indicate approve study investigator . Quality life ( QOL ) assessment ( Seattle Angina Questionnaire [ SAQ ] translate Hebrew ) complete baseline every 2 month control period follow treatment period . After inclusion , patient undergo baseline myocardial perfusion study . Afterwards , patient randomize two group : treat group cross group . Patients treat group undergo HBOT treatment 2 month repeat same-protocol myocardial perfusion study questionnaire , enter 2 month control period . Patients cross group evaluate baseline , 2 month control period treatment 2 month period HBOT treatment ( cross HBOT ) . The following HBOT treatment protocol practice : 40 daily session , 90 minute 100 % oxygen pressure 2 ATA , five day week 8 week .</detailed_description>
