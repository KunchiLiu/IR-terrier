	<brief_summary>AMG 211 bispecific single-chain antibody construct bispecific T-cell engager ( BiTE® ) class target human carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA , CD66e ) ( tumor ) cell cluster differentiation 3 ( CD3 ) positive T-cells . AMG 211 potentially new target drug treatment relapsed/refractory gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma , since CEA express tumor . A well-known challenge current drug development use target therapy high level heterogeneity target expression present specific tumor type . Radio-labeling AMG 211 positron emission tomography ( PET ) radionuclide Zirconium-89 ( 89Zr ) enable non-invasive image quantification AMG 211 distribution cancer patient . By perform 89Zr-AMG211 PET scan prior treatment AMG 211 , uptake tracer primary metastatic tumor lesion normal organ distribution evaluate . By perform 89Zr-AMG211 PET scan AMG 211 continuous intravenous ( cIV ) treatment investigator able evaluate impact prolong steady state exposure AMG 211 tumor tissue uptake . The 89Zr-AMG211 PET image study may help identify patient likely benefit AMG 211 therapy .</brief_summary>
