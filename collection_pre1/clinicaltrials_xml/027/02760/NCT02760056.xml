	<brief_title>Thyroid Hormone Remyelination Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) : A Safety Dose Finding Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot , phase I , placebo control clinical trial short-term high-dose thyroid hormone promote remyelination MS . Permanent clinical disability MS likely cause neuronal damage degeneration follow recurrent demyelination progressive failure remyelination . Thyroid hormone ( TH ) require central nervous system ( CNS ) myelination development , CNS remyelination animal model MS , process similar developmental myelination , also find promote TH . This study ascertain safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose TH people MS , explore signal treatment efficacy mechanism , optimize procedure full scale clinical trial evaluate efficacy pulse TH promotion remyelination MS . The safety tolerability treatment assess use subject ' self-report symptom , validate Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale ( HSS ) , blood pressure measurement . The impact treatment remyelination do compare visual evoke potential ( VEPs ) treatment .</detailed_description>
