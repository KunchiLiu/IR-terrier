	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Functional Performance Outcome After ACL Repair With Internal Brace Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lesions anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) common ligamentous injury increase incidence . 77 % ACL insufficient knee result moderate high physical limitation . Different surgical treatment describe . ACL reconstruction either semitendinosus patella tendon graft regard gold standard operative therapy . Despite numerous study represent good excellent outcome ACL reconstruction , recent Meta-analysis Biau et al . 2006 reveal 40 % patient gain full functional recovery . Since native ACL consider important factor proprioceptive sensation , removal reconstruction might adverse influence muscular stabilisation , rehabilitation functional performance knee joint . Thus primary repair native ACL seem reasonable . For tear anterior cruciate ligament near femoral attachment new method surgical treatment apply . The InternalBrace method Arthrex perform arthroscopically involve reattaching ACL avulse femoral wall use FiberTape Arthrex . To author knowledge augmentation FiberTape Arthrex systematically evaluate . Promising result present recently use comparable method , show high patient satisfaction , fast rehabilitation high rate return pre-injury sport level . To assess functional performance , aim study develop new test battery consist strength test single-leg hop test ability distinguish functional performance injure uninjured leg patient ACL deficiency . Test batteries consist several hop test describe previous literature indicate good test-retest reliability measure low leg performance . The functional performance define use limb symmetry index percent individual low limb . This study aim determine LSI healthy subject use value achieve subject control group . A limb symmetry index ( LSI ) 85 % 95 % consider sufficient return pivot sport patient knee injury .</detailed_description>
