	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia common disorder affect approximately 2 % Canadian population . Patients diagnose fibromyalgia commonly present chronic , widespread pain well fatigue , depression , mood disturbance , cognitive symptom . As result , fibromyalgia negative impact patient 's quality life , negative financial impact , society , healthcare system , lose wage delay diagnosis . Therefore direct conclusive method diagnosis need . Recently , fibromyalgia diagnosis base modified American College Rheumatology Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria fibromyalgia . To assist diagnosis , recent evidence show compare healthy people , people fibromyalgia present difference functional MRI ( fMRI ) whole brain scan , well differences functional blood biomarker challenge test , know fm/a . The fm/a determines function immune system response stimulus , use previously show people fibromyalgia severely blunt immune response . Despite number treatment option available , intervention chronic pain remain largely ineffective . In light demonstrated effectiveness , safety , ease use previous study , radial shockwave therapy ( RSWT ) select inclusion present study . The main objective study determine efficacy effect RSWT compare placebo symptom frequently report association fibromyalgia . In addition , fm/a brain activity associate pain pattern ( fMRI ) may assist early diagnosis prediction treatment success patient fibromyalgia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At St. Joseph 's Care Group ( SJCG ) rheumatologist chronic pain physician determine client eligible participate study use inclusion/exclusion criterion ( outline attach grant proposal ) . Physician would ask client would open discuss possible involvement research study . If , member research team physicians visit client Chronic Pain Management program SJCG discus project complete informed consent process client would like participate . Following informed consent , participant would assign one two group follow restricted randomization procedure . This complete use open-source minimization software call Qminim . The process minimization ensure group size equal eliminate potential bias may introduce important clinical research small size . Group 1 receive Radial Shockwave Therapy ( RSWT ) group 2 placebo group . Once participant placebo group complete study , RSWT offer , although include data analysis . Participants group minimization base sex age follow range : 18-30 , 31-45 , 46-60 year . All participant information/group assignment cod maintain confidentiality . Group assignment unknown participant complete study ( withdraw study ) . The following initial assessment occur prior receive RSWT placebo : At SJCG : participant undergo quantitative sensory test allodynia hyperalgesia one physician . At Lakehead University School Kinesiology : participant basic demographic information height , weight age , measure record data abstraction form member research team . The participant also ask consider painful spot within 3 painful region his/her body . Participants mark 100 millimeter VAS scale point corresponds pain intensity region . The amount pain estimate measure millimeter distance `` pain '' marker mark provide participant question . This record data abstraction form . Pressure pain threshold next measure painful spot within 3 painful region use Baseline© Pressure Tolerance Meter ( 60 lb ) . Pressure apply perpendicular tissue three painful region indicate participant . The participant ask report pressure apply region become painful amount pressure shall record pound data abstraction form . A 30 second rest shall allow recovery technique shall apply painful location . The specific location painful region shall mark documented trained member research team . Next , participant ask complete Beighton Scoring Screen hypermobility , Beck 's Depression Scale , Pain Catastrophizing Scale questionnaire . All score record data abstraction form . At Lakehead University ( NOSM room 1002A , C , D E , F School Kinesiology SB-1028 ) : participant schedule blood sample drawn register phlebotomist . Specialized vacutainers use isolate Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMCs ) later use cytokine protein analysis . All blood take label participant code maintain confidentiality , store NOSM . At TBRHSC : 15 randomly select participant group undergo whole brain functional MRI ( fMRI ) image member research team TBRHSC . The scan include rest state fMRI , 8 minute scan alternate 30 second , 30 second evoked pressure pain stimulus , T1 high resolution anatomical image , diffusion tensor image . Please see attached grant proposal detail regard image method . Once initial measure complete , participant schedule begin allocate treatment base group assignment . Group 1 receive RSWT painful spot within 3 painful region , group 2 ( placebo ) receive similar treatment soft rubber cap apply applicator , leave air transmitter cap participant 's skin . Treatments space one week apart 5 week period time occur Lakehead University 's School Kinesiology , room SB-1028 . Upon completion treatment , participant complete measures/questionnaires perform begin study . Also , one vial blood take participant fMRI group , repeat imaging session detail . At conclusion study , participant invite participate focus group lead another research team member qualitative feedback regard study discuss . This patient-centred approach help investigator engage fibromyalgia community allow input guide future study design . It anticipate 50 participant enrol study . The main analysis comparison pre- post-outcomes , mean repeat measure study design . This design advantage minimize effect inter-subject variability . A power analysis perform priori determine sample size sufficient ; minimum detectable difference 10 % standard deviation ±15 % result power 0.892 .</detailed_description>
