	<brief_title>TURBt With Adjuvant Cryoablation Treat Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder tumor one commonly diagnose urinary tumor world . Worldwide , estimate 429,800 new case 165,100 death due bladder tumor occur 2012 . Transurethral resection ( TUR ) gold-standard treatment non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) . In muscle-invasive bladder cancer , TUR also play vital role bladder-sparing procedure regardless whether apply monotherapy combination chemo-radiotherapy . Whether radical resection tumor initially perform essential treatment bladder tumor . Incomplete TUR influence patient 's prognosis , regardless whether part NMIBC treatment part bladder-sparing trimodal therapy . However , quality TUR one great concern treatment bladder tumor . After initial TUR , approximately 70 % patient exhibit incomplete resection re-staging TUR . Of patient , 30 % exhibit residual tumor resection site . To solve problem , second TUR 4-6 week initial TUR recommend guideline , repeat TURs detect residual tumor 26-83 % case . The investigator seek identify therapy combine TUR eliminate residual tumor . As minimally invasive method , cryotherapy widely use urological tumor , include prostate tumor kidney tumor . With respect bladder tumor , cryotherapy remain exploration phase . Only study use compute tomography ( CT ) -guided percutaneous cryoablation treatment bladder cancer report . Unlike solid viscera , prostate kidney , bladder exhibit feature hollow viscera . Cryoablation transurethral approach could possible safety procedure ensure . A recent animal study conduct porcine model demonstrate feasibility safety transurethral focal , full-thickness cryoablation . No perforation observe two eight-minute freeze cycle . Based success transurethral cryoablation animal experiment , investigator perform study explore safety efficacy cryoablation adjuvant therapy TUR treatment bladder tumor .</detailed_description>
