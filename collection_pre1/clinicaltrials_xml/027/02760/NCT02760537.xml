	<brief_title>Lay Health Worker Model Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities Asian Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 . Develop train protocol certification program lay health worker ( LHWs ) People Asian background likely exhibit cultural relativism lean toward collectivism compare individualism . The personal interaction within self-identified cultural community may closely relate development perceive belief subjective norm , influence act upon identify health behavior ( Ajzen , Albarracin &amp; Hornik 2007 ) . The investigator develop lay health worker ( LHW ) model highlight effect culturally competent human educational interaction facilitate Chinese- , Korean- Vietnamese-American ( CKV-A ) community 's active behavior hepatitis B screening , vaccination , treatment . To develop efficacious effective LHW intervention contribute create critical mass toward sustainable Chinese , Korean Vietnamese ( CKV ) change , strategic approach include follow : 1. Review liver cancer education program guidebook English , ( develop previous project R25 ) . 2 . Refine/revise approaches work group review : Through series bi-monthly meeting participant community advisory board ( CAB ) , CKV-A community , health practitioner outreach worker , expert hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) liver cancer education ( Juon Lee ) , education evaluation ( Park ) , investigator confirm/specify approach available material develop additional assessment approach form English . 3 . Test validity subgroup language version pilot CKV group : Through assessment group ( n=10 ) CKV-As , investigator produce refine validated LHW protocol ( translation back-translation ) . It include common unique approach across/within subgroup ( ) congruent cultural value . 4 . Test pilot LHW implementation 5 . Establish LHW model certify satisfactory practicum experience Patient Navigation training module : Through ongoing assessment study participant participate health care system , investigator monitor LHW experiential learning module provide patient navigation function . The approach identify barrier hinder access timely screen , follow-up , treatment upon diagnosis . Recruitment : Earp et al . ( 1997 ) suggest effective LHWs would follow characteristic skill : ( 1 ) ability comfortably effectively access health care system ; ( 2 ) ability balance demand lay help life responsibility ; ( 3 ) interest AA 's health social issue ; ( 4 ) maintain close , supportive , reciprocal connection others ; ( 5 ) leadership skill . LHW model depend genuine natural helper function . To increase recruitment potential CKVs desire characteristic : First , investigator reach broad pool adult volunteer , regardless gender , income level , health care experience , characteristic also ability speak , read write Chinese , Korean , Vietnamese languages 2nd grade level . Second , adopt referral recruitment strategy social market theory ( Lefebvre et al . 1988 ) may effective people may responsive sense collective cultural group 's interaction , investigator recruit first 10 LHW candidate per ethnic group refer word mouth , faith-based organization leader , community advisory group , health social service agency . Finally , investigator expand recruitment continuously community . In Year 1 , investigator plan train total 60 certify LHWs ( 20 ethnic group ) . The investigator estimate retention 40 ( 67 % ) certify LHWs end Year 1 , base upon literature review ( Anderson 2000 ; Caulfield et al . 1998 ; Han et al . 2009 ) . To replace drop-out LHWs subsequent year , investigator plan recruit train total 30 additional LHWs ( 10 ethnic group ) Years 2 3 . Process Evaluation : Using evaluation model Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) ( Glasgow et al . 2001 ) , framework emphasize Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation Maintenance , investigator examine extent LHW program carry process intend . At individual level , investigator focus Reach ( R ) LHW certification program hepatitis B free event Efficacy/Effectiveness ( E ) LHW certification program . For group level aggregate individual , investigator assess Adoption ( A ) , Implementation ( I ) , Maintenance ( M ) . The investigator ass general administrative process LHW program study period select perspective fidelity ( e.g . logistic review , completion rate ) , dose ( e.g . satisfaction survey ) , method translate form tool ( Saunders , Evans , &amp; Joshi 2005 ) . Specific Aim 2 . To assess prevalence HBV infection provide screen test A total 600 Asian American adult ( 200 Chinese , Koreans , Vietnamese ) , 18 year age old drawn community . Recruitment strategy . The investigator two major channel recruit participant help certify LHWs include hepatitis B initiative Washington DC ( HBI-DC ) screen event Asian American Health Center ( AAHC ) . First , past 10 year , HBI-DC screen 3000 individual Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area approximately 8 11 % positive surface antigen hepatitis B virus ( HBsAg ) . Thus , many individual avail free testing service . LHWs announce upcoming screen event community advertise Korean church Chinese language school word-of-mouth . Our research team LHWs attend event recruit potential participant . Based previous experience , screen event attract 100 150 Asian Americans . Second , investigator go AAHC volunteer clinic recruit participant every Saturday . About 10 12 Chinese Korean patient visit clinic . Patients usually come family member . So , investigator estimate recruit 15 20 participant clinic every Saturday . Finally , investigator identify potential participant advertise ethnic medium ethnic grocery . Sample size estimate : Based previous study ( Juon et al . 2008 ; Hsu et al . 2007 ) , investigator estimate 10 % participant test hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) positive , 40 50 % HBV negative protect , 50 % unprotected . In preliminary analysis R25 , significant mean difference knowledge HBV transmission ( score range 0-10 ) intervention ( 7.21±1.83SD ) control group ( 5.54±2.07SD ) post-test . The investigator estimate sample size 50 intervention control group among unprotected . Assuming conservative rate attrition 20 % , investigator calculate study power base sample size follow-up . The sample size 50 pre-test detect mean difference knowledge outcome 96 % power ( 1-β ) type I error 0.05.Thus , propose sample size ( n=50 ) group among unprotected sufficient power . Our total sample size 600 ( 50/group x 2 group x 2 ( infect protected-50 % study population ) x 3 ethnic group ) . Specific Aim 3 . To implement LHW intervention among unprotected Procedures 1 . Pre-test/Education program : After obtain informed consent pre-test , screen test , blood banking , participant ask complete self-administered questionnaire English , Chinese , Korean , Vietnamese , assistance bilingual interviewer necessary . Then , LHW provide liver cancer education session participant small group set . 2 . HBV screen test/initial biospecimen banking : All participant receive hepatitis B testing . For blood sampling procedure , investigator part-time phlebotomist work field bilingual staff LHW . The phlebotomist draw two tube blood study participant study site . He/she transport one tube blood red-top tube certify clinical lab ( i.e. , Johns Hopkins Medical Institute ( JHMI ) , Quest , LabCorp ) hepatitis B test ( e.g. , HBsAg , HBsAb ( surface antibody HBV ) , HBcAb ( core antibody HBV ) ) . The tube process research sample banking . 3 . Informing result screen test : All participant receive result one week screening . Based screen result , participant categorize three group : ( 1 ) infect ( HbsAg+ ) , ( 2 ) unprotected ( HbsAg-/HbsAb- ) , ( 3 ) protect ( HbsAg-/HbsAb+ ) . The investigator order screen test review test result certify clinical lab . The investigator mail result participant unprotected protect . The investigator follow healthy participant protect . The investigator responsible informing result call infected individual . The participant provide counsel result mean treatment option . 4 . Follow infect : Those infect either refer primary care physician hepatologist directly hepatologist . If participant hepatologist , participant refer hepatologists study team . This base language preference geographic location . 5 . LHW Intervention/follow unprotected : Those unprotected randomly assign either intervention control group computer-automated random assignment . Randomization use assure equivalence group key factor may potentially influence primary outcome HBV vaccination ( e.g. , gender , age , education , length stay U.S. ) . LHWs conduct telephone intervention remind participant series vaccination Months 1 , 2 , 6 among assign intervention group . Those health insurance encourage complete vaccination provider . If participant health insurance , LHWs provide resource help intervention access vaccination refer AAHC , County Health Departments provide vaccination risk population . Those control group receive list resource mail offer free vaccination , local health department along result . Upon complete follow-up , investigator provide delay LHW intervention vaccination control group . Seven month mail result , unprotected follow phone ask status series vaccination promoter barrier vaccination . Their self-reported vaccination verify medical record . Participants ask provide information date vaccination , well location clinic doctor 's office participant receive vaccination . Participants also ask sign medical release form give project staff permission request medical record vaccination . The bilingual interviewer blind participant intervention control group post-test .</detailed_description>
