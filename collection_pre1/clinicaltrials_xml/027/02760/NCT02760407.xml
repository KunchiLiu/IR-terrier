	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safe effective study drug Olokizumab , patient Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) already receive , fully respond treatment methotrexate ( MTX ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Effectiveness Safety Two Dosing Regimens Olokizumab ( OKZ ) , Compared Placebo Adalimumab , Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Who Are Taking Methotrexate But Have Active Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal Phase III study ass safety , tolerability , efficacy OKZ subject moderately severely active RA respond inadequately MTX . The primary endpoint trial Week 12 . Olokizumab expect reduce disease activity improve physical function . The study expect provide safety information large group subject least 24 week period . Adalimumab 40 mg q2w SC include active comparator assay sensitivity non inferiority evaluation .</detailed_description>
