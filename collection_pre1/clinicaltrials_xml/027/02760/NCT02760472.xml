	<brief_summary>Most fatty acid , important development especially Omega-3 fatty acid brain development transfer third trimester mean premature infant transport via placenta interrupt infant dependent concentration breast milk vary depend mother 's diet store . It even suggest low Omega-3 would cause premature delivery . Many country much high level Omega-3 fatty acid breast milk find Sweden breast milk substitution generally supplement Long Chained Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids ( LCPUFA ) . Therefore supplementation give see give risk infant . On contrary , several study show mother eat equal less twice fish week pregnancy give birth infant impair development . Low Omega-3 level premature infants gestational age 23 40 week one reason Retinopathy Prematurity ( ROP ) development . Restoration Omega-3 , Dokosahexaenacid ( DHA ) Eikosapentaenacid ( EPA ) normal utero level may prevent ROP allow normal vessel growth survival . An increase Omega-3 level bring level within physiological range may prevent development ROP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Fatty Acids Study Preventing Retinopathy Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study Randomised Intervention , Single-Center Study Determine Role Fatty Acids Serum Breast Milk prevent Retinopathy Prematurity . Subjects meet inclusion none exclusion criterion enrol study . Upon entry study , subject randomize give unique subject number . A randomised intervention study 45+45 infant without major malformation bear gestational age le 28 week + 0 day perform . Randomization patient either : 1 . Conventional fatty acid supplementation regime Clinoleic ( Vitalipid infant Soluvit supplementation ) preterm infant Or 2 . SMOFlipid , ( soybean oil , medium chain triglyceride , olive oil fish oil ) , ( Vitalipid infant Soluvit supplementation ) , quotient Omega 6:3 2.5:1 order mimic physiologic relation fatty acid cord blood birth , preterm infant . Thus one group infant ( n=45 ) receive Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation . The time parenteral nutrition amount fatty acid give accord clinical routine . The randomization patient perform controller study . Randomization block 10 child block . Data collection After investigator receive informed consent parents/guardians , blood sample 0.2 ml child take accord present clinical practice possible cord ( 2ml ) day 0 , 7 , 14 , 28 postmenstrual week 32 , 36 40 . Blood sample mother Fatty Acids analyse take birth , day 7 gestational week 36 40 . At time ( except day 1 ) , breast milk sample take . Length cm , weight gram head circumference cm measure weekly . Screening ROP perform , least week , accord clinical routine use specific protocol . The investigator intend analyze content phospholipid do small amount blood , relatively insensitive short term fluctuation intake mirror composition many membrane body . The analysis make use gas-liquid chromatography . The method coefficient variability 1-3 % Fatty Acids concern .</detailed_description>
