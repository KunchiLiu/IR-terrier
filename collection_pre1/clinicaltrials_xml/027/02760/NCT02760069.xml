	<brief_title>Isopropyl Alcohol v Ondansetron Nausea Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize control trial test hypothesis nasally-inhaled isopropyl alcohol ( ISO ) plus oral placebo great anti-emetic efficacy compare oral ondansetron oral solution . By design , study double-blinded insofar neither investigator subject notify identity substance inhale swallowing . The study include post-study survey ascertain extent blind achieve . Potential subject present Emergency Department ( ED ) nausea and/or vomit . Investigators recruit convenience sample approach subject time initial triage solicit nausea verbal numerical rating scale ( VNRS ) score 0-10 patient report score 3 great eligible study . Informed consent obtain subject . Subjects allocate one three arm : ( 1 ) inhale isopropyl alcohol plus oral ondansetron ; ( 2 ) inhale isopropyl alcohol plus oral placebo ; ( 3 ) inhale placebo plus oral ondansetron . No subject receive inhale oral placebo ; subject allocate least one therapeutic intervention nausea . Both investigator study subject blind subject allocation . Regarding intervention , upon recruitment , patient administer oral solution ( placebo ondansetron ) treat nurse . A study team member instruct subject inhale one blind prep pad , hold pad approximately 1 centimeter naris , take deep nasal inhalation need nausea relief . The investigator remain arm 's length patient time avoid detect prep pad scent . Additionally , investigator also instruct subject avoid behavior action study would indicate preparation pad use . The investigator record finding data collection form . The primary outcome nausea measure 10 cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 30 minute . Nausea measurement also collect 10 , 20 , 40 , 50 , 60 minute , every hour 5 hour , disposition time patient provide one final nausea VAS score . The study team member present patient 's room interval evaluation . At time nausea measurement , patient offer another preparation pad ( ten pad ) . Investigators notify patient 's treat provider prompt consideration treatment rescue anti-emetic ( metoclopramide promethazine ) patient vomit patient request anti-emetic time . At time nausea measurement , pain score also measure 10 cm VAS . At time final disposition , patient provide satisfaction score 10-cm VAS ask indicate his/her belief whether pad treatment placebo whether oral solution treatment placebo . Similarly , study conclusion patient 's provider ask indicate his/her belief whether pad treatment placebo whether oral solution treatment placebo . Other data collect include time dos medication ( include preparation pad ) fluid administer , episodes vomit ( define forceful expulsion gastric content separate least 2 minute ) , disposition ( admission versus discharge ) , final clinical impression time disposition , time disposition . Subjects follow data collect entirety ED stay .</detailed_description>
