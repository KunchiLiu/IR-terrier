	<brief_summary>Prior deployment transcatheter heart valve ( THV ) , balloon aortic valvuloplasty ( BAV ) often perform rapid right ventricular pacing ( burst &gt; 180 bpm ) induction functional cardiac arrest 30 second . Aortic valve predilation aim facilitate cross aortic annulus , accurate valve positioning also provide information anatomy valve complex . However , BAV show number potentially detrimental effect . There limited experience balloon expandable Edwards THV need predilation ( BAV ) . Experience far document small , uncontrolled case series . The investigator aim document incidence several kind complication large , multicenter registry / prospective control cohort study identify association patient related variable outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aortic valve predilation aim facilitate cross aortic annulus , accurate valve positioning also provide information anatomy valve complex . However , BAV show number potentially detrimental effect , : - Functional cardiac arrest induce rapid pace lead transient coronary , cerebral , renal ischemia . - In patient reduced leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , prolonged cardiac depression rapid pace observe may result hemodynamic failure systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . Both associated high periprocedural mortality . - BAV identify major source thrombotic valvular material , thus increase risk coronary obstruction subsequent myocardial infarction and/or stroke . - The local trauma left-ventricular outflow tract cause BAV may potentially contribute aortic root rupture . The investigator aim document incidence cerebrovascular complication , paravalvular leakage operative outcome large , multicenter registry / prospective control cohort study identify association patient related variable outcome .</detailed_description>
