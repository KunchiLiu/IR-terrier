	<brief_summary>The objective study assess efficacy induction chemotherapy follow transoral surgical treatment neck dissection , definitive management moderately advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma . The surgical treatment carry Transoral Robotic Surgery ( TORS ) Transoral Laser Microsurgery ( TLM ) primary tumor , neck dissection management cervical lymph node . The primary outcome measure disease specific survival ( DSS ) . The secondary oncologic outcome measure locoregional control , relapse free survival , overall survival , Quality Life ( QOL ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current standard care advance ( stage III IV ) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma concomitant chemoradiation , surgery follow adjuvant radiation therapy without concomitant chemotherapy . These approach persistent significant lifelong side effect sequella related treatment , particular radiotherapy . The side effect radiotherapy ( augment concomitant chemotherapy ) include soft tissue fibrosis , loss salivary function , dry mouth , life long disturbed taste function , poor dental health rapidly decay teeth , dysfunction swallowing , significant loss mobility base tongue pharyngeal constrictor , loss laryngeal elevation , esophageal stricture , time severe side effect soft tissue necrosis osteoradionecrosis mandible . About 10 % patient undergoing chemoradiation oropharyngeal cancer develop long term swallow dysfunction feed tube dependency . As result , patient 's quality life ( QOL ) adversely affect . Improvements side effect profile treatment , functional outcome , QOL remain important area advancement treat patient population . Improvements functional outcome need achieve maintain improve oncologic outcome cure rate cancer , compare standard care . Use new Taxane base chemotherapy along Platinum drug ( Cisplatin Carboplatin ) high dose neoadjuvant setting , couple novel minimally invasive Transoral Laser Microsurgery ( TLM ) Transoral Robotic Assisted Surgery ( TORS ) , allow potential improve oncologic outcome well avoidance long term sequalla high dose radiation therapy head neck . These transoral surgical approach ( TLM TORS ) provide improve functional outcome compare traditional open composite resection complex reconstructive algorithm oropharynx . TLM TORS currently clinical use early ( stage T1 T2 N0 N+ve ) oropharyngeal cancer . An area adequately investigate treat moderately advanced oropharyngeal cancer combine neoadjuvant high dose chemo-induction follow minimally invasive transoral surgery ( TLM TORS ) neck dissection definitive treatment . This approach potential far improve functional outcome avoid short importantly long term permanent sequella radiation therapy oropharyngeal cancer treatment . This approach new paradigm treatment oropharyngeal cancer , significantly improve functional outcome cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
