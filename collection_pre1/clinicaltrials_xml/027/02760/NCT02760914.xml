	<brief_title>Adipose Tissue Inflammation Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study observational biochemical end-points disclose inflammatory mechanism various compartment adipose tissue patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) compare patient without significant CHD . Fifty patient CHD undergo coronary artery bypass surgery open chest procedure include 20 patient valve disease without overt CHD undergo open valve surgery serve control group . No specific restriction inclusion lack consent participate write oral information list . In patient undergo open heart surgery CHD , representative peri-operative biopsy epicardial , pericardial subcutaneous fat gather , carefully process deep-frozen 80 degree frost later analyse histological/cellular component messenger ribonucleic acid select inflammatory variable . Simultaneously , blood sample ( arterial blood start operation ) collect , process deep-frozen 80 degree frost later analyse relevant circulate inflammatory variable correlation analyse tissue sample , possibly also PaxGene tube messenger ribonucleic acid circulate leukocyte . The study conduct accord Declaration Helsinki , accordance approval Regional Ethics Committee .</detailed_description>
