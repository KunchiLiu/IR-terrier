	<brief_summary>The study aim investigate immunomodulatory effect thrombopoietin-receptor Agonist ( TPO-RA ) patient primary ITP , fail first-line therapy become intolerant . It hypothesize early phase autoimmune disease may exhibit strong immunomodulatory potential response stimulus , romiplostim . Such process may subsequently capable induce regulatory mechanisms tolerance . Romiplostim ( thrombopoietin-receptor agonist , TPO-RA ) administer subcutaneously weekly 22 week start dose 1mcg/kg body weight . The dose adjust base platelet count describe summary Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) .</brief_summary>
