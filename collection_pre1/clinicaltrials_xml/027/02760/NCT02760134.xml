	<brief_summary>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) well-established treatment modality renal stone . It offer high stone free rate less invasive open surgery . Nevertheless PCNL invasive technically demand procedure inherent risk complication . The troublesome morbidity bleed injury kidney adjacent structure . Complications PCNL tend associate accuracy tract placement size nephrostomy tract . To improve safety PCNL , trend toward use small small nephrostomy tract . With small nephrostomy tract , also arise problem compromised visual field increase difficulty stone extraction . Increase irrigation use pressure pump might improve visualization passive egress stone fragment , also may concomitantly increase intra-luminal pressure . The present system Super-Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( SMP ) develop address many deficiency . The basic component SMP system 8.0 F miniaturize nephroscope newly design irrigation-suction sheath enhance irrigation capability modify nephrostomy sheath continuous negative pressure aspiration . Its design intend prevent excessive intrarenal pressure also improve visualization stone fragment extraction . Little known renal pelvic pressure vivo SMP correlation might postoperative fever urosepsis . We measure renal pelvic pressure SMP determine whether improve renal pelvic pressure improve incidence postoperative fever .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence SMP Renal Pelvic Pressure In Vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate influence SMP renal pelvic pressure treatment renal calculus measure small 25 mm . Investigators single center randomize open-label trial，and investigator plan perform study First Affiliated Hospital Guangzhou Medical University China . Investigators plan begin study April 2016 end March 2018.One hundred patient renal calculus measure small 25 mm enrol study . By simple random sampling technique , patient assign two 50-patient group ( group 1 : F14 , group2 : F12 ) .All patient diagnose definitely operation non-contrast CT . Patients positive preoperative urine culture treat suitable antibiotic base culture sensitivity result least 72h SMP . Patients negative urine culture receive single dose broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis prior procedure . Surgical technique Routine preoperative preparation carry conventional percutaneous surgery . Under general anesthesia patient lithotomy position , open-ended 5F ureteral catheter advance renal pelvis direct vision . The patient turn prone position . Percutaneous access achieve use 18-gauge coaxial needle puncture select calyx fluoroscopic ultrasonic guidance . The success puncture confirm free flow irrigation fluid fluoroscopic image . Using guidewire , dilatation carry 10 F fascial dilator . Thenan irrigation-suction straight sheath , obturator , advance guidewire introduce pelvicalyceal system . The guidewireis remove , `` handle '' connect straight sheath . The irrigation port irrigation-suction sheath connect irrigation pump . The oblique tube sheath connect specimen collection bottle , bottle negative pressure aspirator . The irrigation fluid pressure set 200-250 mmHg . The suction pressure control set 100-150 mmHg . The irrigation deliver irrigation channel sheath . Thus , one-way flow create inflow come irrigation channel sheath immediately aspirate suction conduitof sheath . Stone fragmentation accomplish use either holmium laser pneumatic lithotripter . The tiny pulverized stone fragment pass around scope evacuate oblique sluice . If stone fragment large pass around scope inside sheath , scope withdraw slowly proximal bifurcation order create unobstructed channel large fragment evacuation . At end procedure , single fluoroscopic image obtain assess stone-free status . A Double-J stent place presence obstruct inflammatory ureteric edema , ureteropelvic junction obstruction , concurrent treatment ipsilateral ureteric stone rigid ureteroscope . The sheath remove , wound either sutured seal absorbable gelatin . For patient significant bleeding extravasation , nephrostomy tube place . Measurement Renal Pelvic Pressure In Vivo While prepare SMP , open-ended ureteric catheter , insert renal collecting system retrogradely , connect invasive blood pressure channel patient monitor baroceptor . The baroceptor fix onto horizontal plane renal pelvis ; zero adjustment , measurement renal pelvic pressure session . A computer collect renal pelvic pressure data second . Any factor cause high renal pelvic pressure notice . Data collection Data 2 group -demographic characteristic , site access , Hb decrease , CRP increase , WBC increase , postoperative pain , operation time , hospital stay , case tubeless , postoperative infection complication ( systemic inflammatory response syndrome , urosepsis ) , stone clearance rate need auxiliary treatment compare . Primary study endpoint : The renal pelvic pressure . Secondary endpoint : Postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome urosepsis , stone clearance rate , operation time , hospital stay . Demographic characteristic include age , sex , BMI , stone size location , etc . Stone size define maximum diameter . Operation time record time first percutaneous renal puncture completion stone removal . Hospital stay round near whole day calculate day surgery day discharge . Postoperative pain ( visual analogue scale [ VAS ] , use analgesic ) Postoperative comfort score ( Bruggrmann comfort scale [ BCS ] ) record . The rate hemoglobin decrease assess compare preoperative Hb level 24-hour postoperative Hb level . Primary SFR final SFR assess KUB day 1 1 month operation . Stone-free status define either absence residual stone fragment presence clinically insignificant residual stone fragment kidney define ≦ 3mm , asymptomatic , non-obstructive non-infectious stone particle . If procedure consider successful , double J stent remove outpatient 2 week . Follow-up include KUB non-contrast CT generally schedule 1 month . Bleeding severity judge treat physician , transfusion administer accord local practice guideline . Complications patient record accord modify Clavien classification system .</detailed_description>
