	<brief_summary>The NOVEL Observational longiTudinal studY ( NOVELTY ) observational study obstructive lung disease multi-country , multi-centre , prospective , longitudinal cohort study recruit patient diagnosis , suspect diagnosis , asthma and/or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Patients undergo clinical assessment receive standard medical care determine treat physician . Patients enrol NOVELTY follow yearly treat physician total duration three year . In addition , patient follow remotely every 3 month . The NOVELTY study collect data currently lack allow multinational data collection fill regional/local gap improve comparability across region .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NOVELTY study multi-country , multicentre , observational , prospective , longitudinal cohort study include patient physician diagnosis , suspect diagnosis , asthma and/or COPD . Patients undergo clinical assessment receive standard medical care determine treat physician . All patient enrol NOVELTY study follow yearly treat physician total duration three year . In addition , patient expect follow remotely every quarter . It estimate approximately 7,700 patient suspected primary diagnosis asthma 7,100 patient suspected primary diagnosis COPD enrol diverse set physician ( e.g . primary care physician , allergist , pulmonologists ) community hospital outpatient setting within country target NOVELTY . Exposure ( ) : The NOVELTY study longitudinal cohort study involve study specific medicinal product ; constitute disease registry . Information exposure treatment part routine care collect ( frequency , treatment , duration ) . Sample Size Estimations : The target minimum number 100 patient per diagnostic label ( asthma COPD ) , physician-assessed severity level country choose support many basic local reimbursement specific requirement reasonable precision , provide large sample size scientific question applicable across severity country . Therefore , consider targeted country , estimate approximately 7,700 patient asthma 7,100 patient COPD enrol . Statistical Analysis : After baseline data collection annual data collection , data summarize population overall pre specify subgroup , include country , demographic , exposure , symptom history , treatment history , concurrent clinical feature , treatment setting , socioeconomic set access healthcare , relevant . Patients ' change regard treatment , disease severity among variable observe baseline follow-up visit , also describe . To identify potential difference disease diagnosis severity classification physicians guideline , data collect lung function result , symptom questionnaire , exacerbation occurrence medication allow formal consistent classification patient accord relevant international guideline current future phenotypic/diagnostic classification . Multivariable model use assess following : occurrence exacerbation condition , include upper low Respiratory Tract Infections ( RTIs ) relationship clinical outcome , relationship Patient Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) disease control impact daily activity quality life , relationship healthcare resource use overall related respiratory disease disease severity , clinical outcome , disease type , etc . Multivariable analysis technique use identify phenotype endotypes , base biomarkers and/or clinical parameter associate differential outcome symptom burden , clinical evolution healthcare utilisation .</detailed_description>
