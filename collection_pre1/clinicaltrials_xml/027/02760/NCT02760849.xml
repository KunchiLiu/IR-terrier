	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare change female sexual function patient interval salpingectomy delay oophorectomy ( ISDO ) risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy ( RRSO ) woman carry genetic mutation . Researchers also want learn surgery affect quality life . RRSO standard surgery patient certain type genetic mutation , fallopian tube ovary remove time . ISDO surgery remove fallopian tube first , ovary remove second , later surgery . Most woman genetic mutation encourage remove ovary around age 40 50 . The decision timing remove ovary make doctor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Women Choosing Surgical Prevention ( WISP ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study arm base type surgery choose doctor . If choose ISDO , Group 1 . If choose RRSO , Group 2 . Group 1 : Surgery # 1 : Interval Salpingectomy ( IS ) : If Group 1 , study doctor discus salpingectomy surgery detail , include risk possible benefit . You ask sign surgical consent form . Most patient salpingectomy performed outpatient procedure . This mean likely go home day surgery . If study doctor plan stay overnight hospital reason , discuss . During surgery , inside abdomen look fallopian tube remove . If study doctor find anything surgery may cancerous , tissue sample complete ovary remove surgery test . If cancer find , gynecologic oncologist would perform cancer surgery . Post-Salpingectomy ( IS ) Follow-Up : One ( 1 ) month ( +/- 1 month ) surgery : - If doctor think need , may physical exam , include exam surgical incision ( wound ) review complication may surgery . If live near hospital , may do local doctor . If unable visit study doctor , contact phone . - The pathology ( tissue ) result surgery discuss phone call 1-month visit . If result benign ( show cancer ) , move ovarian cancer assessment period . However , result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist move Follow-Up Phase . Six ( 6 ) month ( +/- 3 month ) surgery : Â°You complete quality-of-life questionnaire . Ovarian Cancer Assessment Period : Every year ( +/- 3 month ) delay oophorectomy ( DO ) surgery : You physical exam , include pelvic exam . You transvaginal ultrasound look ovary . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) draw CA-125 testing . You complete quality-of-life questionnaire . You review sign Completion Oophorectomy Recommendation Form least every year study doctor . This form provide make sure understand current age recommendation surgery remove ovary ( DO ) . The yearly test result discuss . If result benign ( cancer ) , continue yearly test doctor decide Delayed Oophorectomy ( DO ) surgery . When doctor decide DO surgery , pre-oophorectomy test . Pre-Oophorectomy ( DO ) Tests : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may draw CA-125 test . - If doctor think need , may transvaginal ultrasound look ovary . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire - You complete medical questionnaire complete 1 5 year . - If doctor think need , may test . The study doctor discus pre-surgery test result . Surgery # 2 : Delayed Oophorectomy ( DO ) : If pre-oophorectomy test normal , study doctor discus plan surgery detail , include risk possible benefit . You ask sign surgical consent form . Most patient oophorectomy performed outpatient procedure . If study doctor plan stay overnight hospital reason , discuss . During surgery , inside abdomen look ovary remove . If study doctor find anything surgery may cancerous , tissue sample remove surgery test . If cancer find , gynecologic oncologist would perform cancer surgery . Post-Oophorectomy ( DO ) Follow-Up : One ( 1 ) month ( +/- 1 month ) surgery : - If doctor think need , may physical exam , include exam surgical incision ( wound ) review complication may surgery . If live near hospital , may do local doctor . If unable visit study doctor , contact phone . - The pathology result surgery discuss phone call 1-month visit . If result benign ( show cancer ) , move ovarian cancer assessment period . However , result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist move Follow-Up Phase . At 6 month ( +/- 3 month ) , 1 year ( +/- 3 month ) , 2 year ( +/- 3 month ) surgery , complete quality-of-life questionnaire . Group 2 : Surgery : RRSO : If Group 2 , study doctor discus surgery detail , include risk possible benefit . You ask sign surgical consent form . Most patient RRSO perform outpatient procedure . If study doctor plan stay overnight hospital reason , discuss . During surgery , inside abdomen look ovary fallopian tube remove . If study doctor find anything surgery may cancerous , tissue sample remove surgery test . If cancer find , gynecologic oncologist would perform cancer surgery . Post-Surgery ( RRSO ) Follow-Up : One ( 1 ) month ( +/- 1 month ) surgery : - If doctor think need , may physical exam , include exam surgical incision ( wound ) review complication may surgery . If live near hospital , may do local doctor . If unable visit study doctor , contact phone . - The pathology result surgery discuss phone call 1-month visit . If result benign ( show cancer ) , move ovarian cancer assessment period . However , result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist move Follow-Up Phase complete yearly questionnaire . At 6 month ( +/- 3 month ) , 1 year ( +/- 3 month ) , 2 year ( +/- 3 month ) surgery , complete quality-of-life questionnaire . Length Study : Your last study visit 1 month ovary remove . You continue complete questionnaire long possible . You take study early longer want participate cancer find IS RRSO surgery . Follow-Up Phase : You move Follow-Up Phase cancer find IS RRSO surgery , complete necessary quality-of-life questionnaire . You complete yearly follow-up questionnaire long possible . This investigational study . At time , surgery know low risk ovarian cancer RRSO . ISDO previously study may lower ovarian cancer risk . Your decision surgery make doctor . You sign separate consent form describe surgery risk detail . ISDO currently use research purpose MD Anderson . Up 300 woman enrol multicenter study . Up 45 may take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
