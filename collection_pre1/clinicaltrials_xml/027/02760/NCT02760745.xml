	<brief_title>Fever Shivering : Frequency Role Predicting Serious Bacterial Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Fever common complaint lack localizing sign pose diagnostic dilemma , mostly , , child 3 year age . Recent year study find common clinical marker Serious Bacterial Infection ( SBI ) ineffective confirm ruling suspect SBI environment low prevalence SBI develop country . Shivering ( chill , rigor ) febrile illness common complaint child 's true incidence unknown . It assume shiver appear frequently child SBI one study pediatric population find support assumption . No study find describe frequency shiver emergency department . Study purpose : To describe frequency febrile shiver pediatric population arrive emergency department 's relation Severe Bacterial Infection . Participants : Children age range 3 month 18 year present fever . Intervention : During study time frame frequency febrile shiver document . Patients febrile shiver meet inclusion criterion , sepsis workup do include blood sample inflammatory marker , blood culture , urinalysis urine culture urinary tact infection suspect . Other system ( CSF sampling , joint fluid aspiration , stool culture , chest x ray ) examine accord appropriate history clinical suspicion . The work do next consecutive patient present fever without shiver . Results : The frequency febrile shivering , positive culture , lobar pneumonia chest x ray . A comparison study control group make . Categorical variable compare use Chi square test Fisher exact test ( appropriate ) . Continuous variable compare use student test Mann Whitney test . The relation bacterial infection clinical variable analyze use logistic regression . Study group size : This pilot study . Investigators use convenience sample child admit shiver study period . Safety : All examination hold emergency department organic staff routine method do otherwise outside study setting . The emergency department hospital protocol patient identification infection control carry invasive procedure . Ethics : Parents ask agreement answer questioner part study agreement document . Informed consent ask patient , legal guardian . The study hold accord ethic rule Helsinki declaration approve local Ethics board . Access database restrict study investigator . The database encrypt password . After gather data statistical analysis information identify patient remove . The importance study : Fever child common complaint frequently pose dilemma extent workup need beyond clinical evaluation . This study aim examine frequency shiver among child present ED fever , ability predict risk severe bacterial infection .</detailed_description>
