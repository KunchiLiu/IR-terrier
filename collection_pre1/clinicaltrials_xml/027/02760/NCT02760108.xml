	<brief_summary>One person every 500 Parkinson 's around 127,000 people live condition UK . The aim study identify new gene predispose cause Parkinson 's Disease Parkinsonism . There press need study genetic makeup family member without Parkinson 's . As family share common genetic background , easy find new Parkinson 's gene study genetic makeup people Parkinson 's alongside member family . We particularly interested study genetic makeup two group people : 1. develop Parkinson 's age 45Í¾ 2. family history relative affect Parkinson 's . By identify genetic factor cause Parkinson 's , hope understand condition . Doing lead development well diagnosis , improved disease model , hope time , development well treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One person every 500 Parkinson 's around 127,000 people live condition UK . Unfortunately , progressive disease cure . Many treatment available improve maintain someone 's quality life , investigator would like develop treatment use much earlier disease process . These could slow disease prevent progressing . For people develop Parkinson 's clear underlying cause . However , investigator particularly interested minority people diagnose Parkinson 's either early onset disease and/or relatives affect Parkinson 's . The investigator believe variation inherit material ( gene ) sometimes cause disease , may run family . This open door range study effect gene variation nerve cell brain level , investigator hope lead new target treatment . It already know rare gene variant cause Parkinson 's . Some inherit call 'autosomal dominant ' way i.e . child person type gene change 50 % chance inheriting . However , also know everyone carry change go develop disease . Some people appear protect develop disease investigator would like understand well . Other variant , particularly important early onset Parkinson 's `` recessive '' , form inheritance low risk parent child . The investigator look closely genetic makeup people Parkinson 's comparison unaffected people comparison unaffected affect family member order find gene change cause Parkinson 's . Following identification genetic variation cause Parkinson 's , collaboration NHS researcher , investigator plan : 1 ) develop new NHS test Parkinson 's 2 ) develop new disease model act testbed new treatment</detailed_description>
