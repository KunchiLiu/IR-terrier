	<brief_summary>Anemia clinical manifestation , commonly observe patient inflammatory bowel disease , account significant loss quality life patient . The aim current study ass effect orally administer iron treatment , well response predictor patient inflammatory bowel disease remission present anemia . The study recruit 100 patient Crohn 's disease ( CD ) 100 patient ulcerative colitis ( UC ) diagnose regularly monitor Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center University Hospital Federal University Juiz de Fora , clinical , hematological , biochemical immunological assessment . Blood sample collect ( 10 ml ) follow test perform anemia patient ( remission ) begin treatment 8 week later : complete blood count , mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) , mean corpuscular hemoglobin ( MCH ) , mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ( MCHC ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , transferrin saturation index , ferritin , serum iron , hepcidin , quantitative C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) ) fecal calprotectin . In addition , quality life , anxiety depression fatigue questionnaire apply patient ( IBDQ , HAD Chalder ) . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion use diagnose anemia , therefore , hemoglobin low 12 g/dl woman 13g/dl men consider anemia ; hemoglobin low 10 g/dl consider severe anemia . Patients mild moderate anemia remission initially treat oral iron ( oral liposomal iron ) occurrence possible symptom related oral iron intolerance assess , well patient ' disease activity level quality life . The patient follow-up subject new laboratory test eighth oral iron treatment week . The result current study expect help assess oral iron efficacy response predictor , well side effect treatment impact quality life patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Study Design : Two hundred ( 200 ) patient inflammatory bowel disease remission - 100 patient Crohn 's disease 100 patient ulcerative colitis - randomly select . The patient inform participation study generate expense financial benefit . Any doubt may study clarify free participate . Their refusal result penalty change way serve . They may withdraw consent discontinue participation time . Laboratory test conduct University Hospital , accord follow-up routine apply patient inflammatory bowel disease , represent risk health different common blood test . The study protocol submit Research Ethics Committee University Hospital evaluation . All patient include study sign free inform consent form . The patient assess accord eligibility criterion demographic data ( age , gender ) body weight record first visit . They undergo interview ass symptom possible disease activity one week begin treatment . They also fill questionnaire quality life , anxiety depression another one fatigue treatment . Only patient complete 8-week treatment include study . Blood sample ( 10ml ) collect hematological , biochemical immunological assessment , treatment . The following hematological biochemical test perform patient anemia : complete blood count , MCV , MCH , MCHC , ferritin , transferrin saturation index , hepcidin , quantitative CRP , IL-6 fecal calprotectin . The blood collection perform biochemistry resident University Hospital Juiz de Fora , well examination , do supervision biochemistry professor University Hospital residency program . All patient study subject follow test : a. clinical assessment ; b. questionnaire quality life c. questionnaire fatigue d. questionnaire anxiety depression e. biochemical assessment ; f. ileocolonoscopy biopsy histopathological study . 2 . Study flowchart 1 . Phase I - Patient selection - Clinical , biochemical , colonoscopic histopathological assessment - Assessment IBDQ , HAD Fatigue scale 2 . Phase II - Supplementation oral iron - Monitoring complication 3 . Phase III - Clinical , biochemical , colonoscopic histopathological reassessment - Reassessment IBDQ , HAD Fatigue scale - Study completion 3 . Statistical analysis The collect data analyze specific statistical software ( SPSS -Statistical Package Social Sciencesâ„¢ , version 21.0 ) . The patient divide two group ( mild moderate anemia ) data analysis , accord hemoglobin level . The comparison group , well possible relation socio-demographic clinical variable , change IBDQ , HAD fatigue scale analyze parametric Student 's t-test , Chi-square test nonparametric Mann-Whitney test , whenever appropriate . Univariate multivariate logistic analysis perform identify possible independent predictor oral iron response within entire group . The result present odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . The statistical significance level set P &lt; 0.05 , comparison .</detailed_description>
