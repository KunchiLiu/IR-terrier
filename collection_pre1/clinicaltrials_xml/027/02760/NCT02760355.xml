	<brief_summary>In pilot study , investigator plan treat patient chronic hepatitis C due HCV genotype 3 infection use interferon-free regimen consist administration ribavirin sofosbuvir/ledipasvir - combination nucleotide RNA polymerase inhibitor non-structural protein 5A inhibitor . Patients undergo euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp , use tracer , indirect calorimetry ass whether viral suppression induce regimen capable reverse glucose metabolic alteration induce HCV liver extrahepatic compartment . Adipose muscle tissue biopsy also perform assess specific molecular change induce HCV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extrahepatic Insulin Resistance Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study show hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection induces insulin resistance , may progress type 2 diabetes susceptible individual . Despite fact HCV infect liver , insulin resistance patient appear originate mostly extrahepatic tissue , particularly muscle adipose tissue . The aim trial ass relative contribution hepatic vs. extrahepatic tissue pathogenesis insulin resistance chronic hepatitis C. To , 20 patient enrol single-arm , open-label study . Study subject include 10 patient without feature metabolic syndrome , another 10 metabolic syndrome . All patient receive regimen consist Ledipasvir 90 mg/Sofosbuvir 400 mg , one tablet day , associate body weight-dose adjusted , 200 mg-tablets ribavirin ( 1,000 mg two administration patient &lt; 75 Kg body weight , 1,200 mg two administration &gt; 75 Kg ) 12 week . Insulin resistance investigate baseline ( treatment ) 6 week treatment use euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp deuterated glucose : result obtain 6 week - i.e . time complete viral suppression - compare basal condition i.e . antiviral treatment .</detailed_description>
