	<brief_summary>Iodine essential trace element necessary synthesis thyroid hormones critical human growth development throughout lifecycle . Iodine particularly important pregnancy infancy brain neurological development . Severe iodine deficiency pregnancy cause severe mental impairment stillbirth mild-to-moderate deficiency associate impaired infant development . As , pregnant woman woman child-bearing age particularly vulnerable effect iodine deficiency . Globally , 241 million ( 30 % ) school age child iodine deficient . Historically , UK Ireland believe iodine sufficient concern express last decade regard iodine status UK Irish population . A study Irish woman 2004 report 55 % pregnant woman sample population moderately iodine deficient 53 % non-pregnant woman moderately iodine deficient . A study UK schoolgirl find 51 % mildly iodine deficient 16 % moderately deficient . Importantly , prevalence iodine deficiency high Northern Ireland 85 % sample iodine deficient . Iodine know interact selenium conversion thyroid hormone thyroxine ( T4 ) metabolically active triiodothyonine ( T3 ) hormone . Selenium also important immune , cardiovascular cognitive function . Selenium status report moderately low use pooled English data blood selenium concentration 1984 1992 . In addition , late National Diet Nutrition Survey report selenium intake recommendation several population group include woman childbearing age mean selenium intakes 76 % recommend 60µg/day . This national survey also report 49 % woman age 19-64 year fail meet lower reference nutrient intake 40µg/day . Milk dairy product major source iodine UK population also source selenium . The contribution milk dairy product iodine selenium intake greatest adult female ( 35 % 6 % respectively ) . Observational evidence repeatedly report milk consumption positively correlate iodine status iodine intake . Research Iceland New Zealand report milk consumption associate selenium status ; however unknown true UK population . To date , randomise control trial examine effect milk consumption either iodine selenium status . The possibility increase iodine selenium intake increase milk consumption , widely available consume foodstuff , population group vulnerable micronutrient deficiency investigate . This would add valuable data knowledge base iodine , ongoing debate appropriate mean increase iodine intake amongst woman childbearing age UK salt iodisation , key strategy prevent deficiency , implement . The aim study investigate impact cow 's milk consumption biological status iodine selenium among woman child-bearing age . The study 12 week randomised-controlled human intervention study . Participants randomise consume additional semi-skimmed milk Following amount , control group ( 0mls/day ) , intervention group ( 430mls/day 3l per week ) .</brief_summary>
