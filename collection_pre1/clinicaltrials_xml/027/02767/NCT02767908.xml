REC Reference Number:10/H0403/34 ) Programme ( RP-PG-0608-10020 ) demonstrate default delivery cessation support smoker hospital significantly increase uptake support double proportion smoker quit long term . Clinical experience indicate many smoker admit hospital , particularly illness cause exacerbated smoking , motivate smoke discharge also likely heavily dependent smoke many case disable lung heart disease , socially isolated , socio-economically deprive . On leave hospital , many participant return home environment smoke integral part daily life many year . It therefore surprising whilst many participant manage stay smoke-free hospital stay , relapse discharge common . The Investigators previous study , among smoker receive care similar recommend NICE , 62 % participant abstinent discharge relapse 4 week , 81 % 6 month . The Investigators hypothesise many relapse could prevent intervention help sustain cessation maintenance smoke-free home discharge .
