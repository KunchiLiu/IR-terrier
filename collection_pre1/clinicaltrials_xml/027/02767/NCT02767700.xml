	<brief_summary>The tumor tissue patient pancreatic cancer submit next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) data evaluate oncology treatment decision support ( TDS ) software tool medicinal product class 1 ( CE-marked ) . This software make evidence-based suggestion drug likely effective , ineffective , toxic ( FDA approve biomarkers ) . For patient fit second-line therapy , result recommendation judge tumor board .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tumor tissue patient ( surgical resection , biopsy ) use SWEDAC-certified DNA extraction NGS . Pseudonymised sequence data feed TDS software tool ( TreatmentMAP™ , Molecular Health ) base publish evidence , suggestion make , grade NCCN category approve drug indication otherwise , clinical evidence experimental . Same anticipate inefficacy . In addition , FDA-approved biomarkers toxicity analyse . This information take tumor board make decision whether information useful eventually recommend treatment give patient .</detailed_description>
