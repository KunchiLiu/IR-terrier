	<brief_summary>Background : Culture affect way person think illness . This affect seek help illness . It also affect choose treatment follow . This lead health disparity among certain group people . Breast colon cancer common cancer Latinos . Even though get cancer low rate population group , Latinos likely diagnose cancer advance stage . Researchers want study Latina woman immigrant believe cause breast colon cancer factor think play role disease . This understanding could lead good interaction Latinos doctor . Objective : To learn Latina immigrant believe cause breast colon cancer factor think play role disease . Eligibility : Women age 18 older : Were bear Latin America Speak Spanish Have never breast , ovarian , colon cancer Design : Participants interview person phone . This take hour . The interview record . Participants answer question : Their family cancer history What think cause breast colon cancer What think plays role disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Where Culture Meets Genetics : Exploring Latinas Causal Attributions Breast Colon Cancer Models Disease Inheritance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research understand source health disparity acknowledge addition biomedical risk factor , culture play important role differential health outcome . Consequently , understand cultural difference may influence health behavior key work towards reduce disparity . Causal attribution key component individual illness perception thus impact health behavior , may present health disparity population level . While research explore non-Hispanic White woman causal attribution breast cancer , less know Latina beliefs cause breast cancer , little know causal attribution colon cancer population . Understanding Latina causal attribution breast colon cancer may provide insight determinant cancer disparities population . Because subset breast colon cancer result single gene mutation , confer increase risk develop cancer , understand causal attribution Latina population relevant field genetics . This especially true since Latinas historically underutilized cancer genetic risk assessment counsel test service . As service become standard part general healthcare provision , become increasingly important understand way different cultural group interact genetic information . One way do investigate culturally inform mental model disease risk inheritance . This study seek describe causal attribution breast colon cancer explore mental model disease inheritance among Latina immigrant . A qualitative exploratory design include interview comprise free-listing , ranking , open-ended question use . Participants recruit NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program well use resource within Office Participant Recruitment . First , describe Latina causal attribution cancer . Next , use cultural consensus theory ( CCT ) identify describe common cultural model cause cancer . Finally , explore Latina mental model disease inheritance use free-listing openended question . 2 . Objectives specific aim . The objective study describe cultural model Latina immigrant regard causal attribution breast colon cancer well explore group mental model disease inheritance . Aim # 1 : To identify main causal attribution breast colon cancer among Latina immigrant . Aim # 2 : To use cultural consensus analysis identify presence absence share cultural model causal attribution breast colon cancer among participant . Aim # 3 : To describe mental model disease inheritance hold member Latina immigrant population . 3 . Brief Rationale Background : Latinos United States Hispanic Latino currently large minority group United States , constitute 17 % population 2013 accord U.S. Census Bureau . In Maryland specifically , 2010 census find 8.3 % population Hispanic Latino , July 2014 , U.S. Census Bureau estimate 9.2 % Maryland population Hispanic Latino . Notably , absolute number Hispanics Latinos Maryland double period 2000-2010 , indicating high level growth segment population ( http : //quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/24000lk.html ) . The U.S. Office Management Budget ( OMB ) define Hispanic Latino person Cuban , Mexican , Puerto Rican , South Central American , Spanish culture origin regardless race ( http : //www.census.gov/topics/population/hispanic-origin/about.html ) . For purpose proposal , term Latino/a refer people Spanish-speaking country Western hemisphere , Latino/a immigrants refer person bear one country since immigrate United States . Notably , work definition exclude people Spanish Brazilian nationality descent , mainly due cultural focus investigation .</detailed_description>
