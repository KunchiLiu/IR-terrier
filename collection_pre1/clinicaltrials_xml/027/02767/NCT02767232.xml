	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine use adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) , include intrathrombus administration rt-PA ( Activase/Alteplase ) , prevent post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) pediatric patient symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) compare optimal standard anticoagulation alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric High-Risk Deep Venous Thrombosis Lytic Outcomes Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>rt-PA , study drug , fibrinolytic drug indicate use acute myocardial infarction , acute ischemic stroke , acute massive pulmonary embolism adult . Previous study show ability rt-PA lyse venous thrombus patient deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , suggest successful rt-PA mediate thrombolysis prevent post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) . rt-PA deliver directly venous thrombus use catheter/device embed within thrombus physician imaging guidance . This method rt-PA delivery , catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) , think safer , effective , efficient previous method . The question whether CDT use rt-PA improves long-term DVT patient outcomes acceptable risk cost currently study ATTRACT Trial adult , yet address pediatric population . The rationale perform PHLO Trial base upon : - major burden PTS pediatric DVT patient U.S. healthcare system - report association rapid clot lysis prevention PTS - proven ability rt-PA dissolve venous thrombus proximal DVT - recent advance CDT method may lower bleeding risk , could , inadvertently , cause endothelial injury small caliber vessel pediatric patient - lack outcome evidence either anticoagulation catheter-directed thrombolysis child - major clinical controversy whether CDT routinely use first-line DVT therapy</detailed_description>
