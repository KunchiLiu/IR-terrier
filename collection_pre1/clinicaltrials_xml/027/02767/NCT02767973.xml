	<brief_title>To Identify Persons Who Are Susceptible WSP-induced Inflammation Examine Role GSTM1 Other Factors This Susceptibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Particulate matter ( PM ) lead cause respiratory tract cardiovascular disease United States world-wide . Wood smoke particle ( WSP ) derive wild land fire account significant fraction ambient air PM . Health effect associate WSP include acute bronchitis , asthma exacerbation , pneumonia , cough systemic inflammation . While effect see healthy asthmatic individual , many study indicate asthmatic increase susceptibility effect WSP . Though WSP-related effect cardiovascular ( CV ) disease less well document , WSP contribute PM level , PM exposure link CV health effect ( change heart rate variability , vascular reactivity , lipid profile ) . WSP wild land fire cause abrupt increase ambient air PM 2.5 level ( mean level ~250µg/m3 , peak level &gt; 1000 µg/m3 ) . Avoidance rapidly increase PM air pollution due wild land fire feasible , many people leave burn region . This screen protocol ensure ultimately adequate subject available test gamma tocopherol appropriate population . It identify volunteer ≥10 % increase % PMNs follow WSP challenge baseline value ( SA1 ) . This screening procedure identify various risk factor may increase risk experience airway inflammation related adverse health outcome follow WSP exposure . The GSTM1- genotype risk factor extensively explore . Researchers CEMALB report GSTM1- healthy volunteer ( HVs ) increase inflammatory systemic response O3 various component PM ( LPS70 Diesel exhaust particle ) . Using 10 % increase % PMNs define PMN responsiveness , result show GSTM1- volunteer 13 fold high risk PMN responders 0.06 ppm O3 . When examine % PMNs continuous measure , observe GSTM1- volunteer increase airway PMN response O3 well increase airway systemic PMN response LPS70 . The researcher CEMALB also examine various response feature 27 individual ( 13 healthy , 4 allergic non asthmatic , 10 allergic asthmatic ) define responsive ( R , n=18 ) non-responsive ( NR , n=9 ) O3 base airway PMN influx ( % PMNs ) . Among factor explore inflammatory response , baseline characteristic gene expression profile recover sputum cell . The researcher also observe within individual , PMN response O3 LPS correlate , anticipate WSP induce inflammatory response via mechanism similar pollutant .</detailed_description>
