	<brief_title>A Comparative Study Six Methods Measure Human Contrast Vision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human spectral contrast sensitivity function ( CSF ) good way estimate human vision letter chart commonly used ophthalmologist , optometrist optician . The current method use measure CSF often unreliable , due high variability measurement . This study compare four ( 4 ) new test two ( 2 ) currently use standard test . The contrast sensitivity function measure use six ( 6 ) method three time ( 3 ) two ( 2 ) eye two ( 2 ) occasion . Each subject CSF measure 6x3x2x2 = 72 time . In addition , CSF measurement , time use measure CSF number background variable subject record . After informed consent obtain , subject undergo visual examination . If match inclusion criterion include . At time early possible convenience , CSF measure use six method background information record . The follow-up measurement occasion occur 4 6 week ( 28 42 day ) first . To facilitate comparison previous study , CSF-measurements ( rel . contrast/cycles/degree ) convert log ( Base 10 logarithm ) scale . The unit thus log CSF ( LCSF ) [ log [ relative contrast ] /log [ cycles/per degree ] ] .</detailed_description>
