	<brief_title>eXalt3 : Study Comparing X-396 ( Ensartinib ) Crizotinib ALK Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate efficacy safety X-396 ( ensartinib ) vs. crizotinib patient ALK-positive NSCLC receive 1 prior chemotherapy regimen prior ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , obtain additional pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data sparse PK sampling , compare quality life ( QoL ) patient receive X-396 vs. crizotinib , evaluate status exploratory biomarkers correlate clinical outcome , obtain germline DNA sample possible pharmacogenetic analysis event outlier respect efficacy , tolerability/safety , exposure identify .</detailed_description>
