	<brief_summary>To study addition HAIC follow complete removal early stage liver cancer HCC prevent delay recurrence disease . Half participant receive two cycle HAIC hepatectomy , half return baseline surveillance schedule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy ( HAIC ) Hepatoma After Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high incidence HCC recurrence follow liver resection serious issue . The recurrent rate high 50-60 % 3 year 70-100 % 5 year . So reduce recurrence rate HCC , intervention try clinic , include transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , immunotherapy , interferon treatment etc . But adjuvant therapy prove effective long term efficacy clinical application remain explored . HAIC prove effective adjuvant treatment patient liver metastasis colorectal cancer randomize controlled trial meta-analysis , role adjuvant HAIC liver resection controversial . The result get different randomize control trial vary significantly bias patient selection , different study design，the small size sample , different drug use chemotherapy lack proper stratification , big sample size , well patient select well design randomize control trial need confirm role postoperative HAIC . Patients HCC receive curative liver resection ( R0 ) randomly assign 1:1 doctor receive adjuvant HAIC ( control group ) HAIC ( treatment group ) . All patient treatment group receive 2 cycle adjuvant HAIC within 3 month liver resection . The outcomes patient evaluate 5-years follow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 year old Informed consent Confirmation diagnosis HCC : For subject undergoing surgical resection histological confirmation mandatory ( post surgery pathology report require histological confirmation risk stratification ) . After qualify time scanning , independent radiology review diagnose CR ( residual tumor deposit radical therapy Assess level risk disease recurrence tumor characteristic moderate high risk Subjects undergone surgical resection treatment HCC curative intent within 4 month stag potentially curative treatment . At least 3 week ( 21 day ) 7 week ( 49 day ) , resection course , CT/MRI scan date . A timeframe 4 week surgical resection recommend . Male female subject ≥ 18 year age Confirmation complete response ( CR ) ( absence residual tumor curative treatment ) , eligibility scan independent radiological review . For subject undergoing surgical resection pathology proven complete removal tumor . Intermediate High Risk recurrence assess tumor characteristic . ChildPugh score 5 7 point . A ChildPugh score 7 point allow absence ascites . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess central lab mean follow laboratory requirement sample within 14 day prior randomization : Alpha fetoprotein ≤ 400 ng/mL Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 14 day prior start treatment ( assess centrally ) . Recurrent HCC ChildPugh score 7 point presence ascites . The following tumor characteristic : Low risk recurrence curative treatment define follow : local ablation patient : single lesion ≤ 2 cm surgical resection patient : single lesion ≤ 2 cm without microscopic vascular invasion , without tumor satellite histologically well differentiate . ≥ 3 lesion 23 lesion ≥ 3 cm size ( large diameter , unidimensional measurement ) prior curative treatment ( surgical resection local ablation ) single lesion ≥ 5 cm ( large diameter , unidimensional measurement ) size prior local ablation . Macrovascular invasion Extrahepatic spread ( include regional lymph node invasion adjacent structure ) History cardiovascular disease : History HIV infection Active clinically serious infection ( ≥ grade 2 NCICTCAE version 3.0 ) Subjects seizure disorder require medication ( steroids antiepileptic ) History organ allograft Subjects evidence history bleed diathesis Subjects undergoing renal dialysis Previous concurrent cancer distinct primary site histology cancer evaluate study EXCEPT cervical carcinoma situ , treat basal cell carcinoma , superficial bladder tumor [ Ta , Tis &amp; T1 ] cancer curatively treat ≥ 3 year prior study entry define sign informed consent . Uncontrolled ascites ( define easily control diuretic treatment ) Encephalopathy History GI bleed within 30 day randomization . Subjects history esophageal varix bleed follow effective therapy and/or treatment prevent bleed recurrence . Prior anti cancer therapy treatment HCC ( include sorafenib molecular therapy ) exclude . Major surgery within 4 week start study define sign informed consent , except surgical resection local ablation HCC . Autologous bone marrow transplant stem cell rescue within 4 month study entry define sign informed consent . Use biologic response modifier , colony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) , within 3 week study entry , define signing informed consent .
