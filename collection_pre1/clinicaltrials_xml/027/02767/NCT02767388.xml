	<brief_summary>Broadly speaking , goal study well understand influence chemotherapy treatment cognitive neural mechanism underlie human behavior . Extant literature lack diversity study cancer population treatment protocol , provide limited understand cognitive ability impair chemotherapy . To overcome limitation , study employ sophisticated battery test understudy cancer population . Eligible participant either patient diagnose Myelodysplasic Syndrome ( MDS ) demographically match healthy control patient . After MDS diagnosis treatment protocol establish , patient induct longitudinal study comprise three visit : 1 ) diagnosis prior chemotherapy treatment ( baseline ) , 2 ) one treatment cycle ( one month post-baseline ) , 3 ) three treatment cycle ( three month post-baseline ) . Patients undergo test battery design measure specific behavioral neural mechanism attention ; test either computer-based cognitive task simulate drive test immerse patient virtual drive scenario . During test , EEG concurrently measure non-invasive scalp electrophysiology recording ; EEG recording reveal underlying neural mechanism affect chemotherapy . Additionally , neuropsychological test vision , attention , memory administer , well questionnaires evaluate health , mobility , life space . Finally , blood sample collect examine level circulate inflammation-specific protein typically present cancer patient . This study allow u good understand mechanism chemotherapy influence cognitive performance . Results study influence administration chemotherapy treatment patient continue receive high medical care maintain optimal cognitive ability quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The broad goal research project develop core set biomarkers chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment ( chemobrain ) . Clinical study document mild cognitive impairment chemotherapy patient frequently within domain attention memory , though impairment observe across broad range cognitive ability . In addition , neuroimaging study demonstrate chemotherapy-related structural functional change distribute cortical area , include region fronto-parietal attention network . While study suggest chemotherapy treatment negatively impact patient health cognitive function , remain unclear chemotherapy affect neural mechanism cognitive ability . Current literature limit four major way : ( 1 ) research focus breast cancer population , provide little insight impact tumor type , ( 2 ) study examine parametric effect chemotherapy toxicity , ( 3 ) neuropsychological exam provide weak resolution specific cognitive function , ( 4 ) neural factor associate cognitive impairment difficult dissociate non-neural ( e.g . psychosocial ) factor . To overcome central limitation , investigator propose one-year longitudinal study aim systematically examine influence cancer stage treatment toxicity mild cognitive impairment observe Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) implement core battery behavioral neural measure attention . At diagnosis , MDS patient designate one five risk group ( low , low , intermediate , high , very-high ) base bone marrow assay result , risk group assign treatment protocol monotonically increase toxicity risk category , thus allow parametric evaluation cancer stage treatment toxicity measure attention . Our specific aim ( SA ) : SA1 : Quantify chemotherapy-related impairment attention-specific process MDS patient . H1a : No difference behavioral measure attention observe across MDS group prior treatment , MDS group perform bad healthy control . H1b : Exposure chemotherapy predict behavioral impairment attention , magnitude impairment link treatment toxicity . SA2 : Quantify electrophysiological measure attention-specific process determine link chemotherapy-related impairment neural activity cognitive ability . H2a : No difference electrophysiological measure attention observe across MDS healthy control group prior treatment . H2b : Exposure chemotherapy predict functional impairment electrophysiological measure attention , magnitude impairment link treatment toxicity . H2c : Chemotherapy-related impairment neural measure attention predict concurrent impairment behavioral measure attention ( H1b ) . SA3 : Implement control simulation on-road drive scenario probe specific attention process determine impact chemotherapy complex real-world behavior . H3a : No difference drive performance observe across MDS group prior treatment , drive performance well healthy control compare MDS patient . H3b : Exposure chemotherapy predict great impairment simulate drive performance , magnitude impairment link treatment toxicity . H3c : Impairments behavioral ( H1a ) neural measure ( H2a ) attention predict great impairment simulate on-road driving performance . Our empirical approach allow u rigorously study neural mechanism chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment . The current proposal aim extend previous research longitudinally investigate understudied cancer population whose constituent assign treatment group diagnosis , thus provide sufficient experimental control examine parametric effect cancer burden treatment toxicity specific mechanisms attention . Results obtain study critical understanding risk factor associate chemotherapy , allow clinician make informed treatment recommendation order reduce likelihood cognitive impairment maintain high quality life possible ever-increasing cancer survivor population .</detailed_description>
