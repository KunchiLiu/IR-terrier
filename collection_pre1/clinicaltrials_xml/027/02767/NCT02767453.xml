	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine limit effectiveness drain Total Shoulder Arthroplasty . Drains use joint arthroplasty procedure decrease infection rate , swell , number dress change require hospital stay . The use drain heavily investigate hip knee replacement literature , investigation regard use shoulder replacement , despite frequent use . Clinical benefit consistently document regard drain usage hip knee arthroplasty investigator hypothesize limited utility total shoulder arthroplasty well . The investigator perform prospective investigation total shoulder arthroplasty patients- divide two groups- half receive drain time surgery half receive drain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed Suction Drainage Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use closed-suction drain well study hip knee arthroplasty literature . Drains use intention decrease infection , ecchymoses , frequency dressing change . Some report corresponding decrease hematocrit patient receive post-op drainage lead increased transfusion need . Given clinical benefit consistently document regard drain usage knee hip arthroplasty , longer routinely use operation . The use drainage system shoulder arthroplasty , however , study benefit drain use regard patient outcomes questionable . As , study prospective investigation compare outcome two group total shoulder arthroplasty patient , receive drain time surgery without drain . The short-term outcome measurement include peri-operative hematocrit hemoglobin , infection rate , hematoma development , transfusion requirement , ecchymosis wound complication . Long-term outcome include shoulder functional score measure post-operative visit need revision shoulder surgery .</detailed_description>
