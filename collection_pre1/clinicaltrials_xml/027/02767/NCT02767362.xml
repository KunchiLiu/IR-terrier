	<detailed_description>This preoperative window , phase 0 study short-term atorvastatin treatment obese woman undergo surgical stag endometrial cancer . After recruitment complete , 24 pair endometrial biopsy hysterectomy specimens endometrial cancer patient treat UNC retrospectively obtain Department Pathology serve control . These case match stage grade endometrial cancer woman enrol phase 0 clinical trial undergo immunohistochemical analysis . Two previous phase 0 window study metformin endometrial cancer find difference Ki-67 expression preoperative endometrial biopsy hysterectomy specimen control patient , although difference see metformin treated patient . However , investigator plan include control group ensure change find pre- post-atrovastatin treated patient due effect drug versus difference type specimen examine ( i.e . endometrial biopsy specimen obtain clinic versus hysterectomy specimen obtain time surgery ) . In addition , enrol patient undergo repeat endometrial biopsy post- atorvastatin treatment time surgical staging . Thus , study investigator plan compare pre-treatment endometrial biopsy post-treatment endometrial biopsy hysterectomy specimen well historical control group .</detailed_description>
