	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Minimal Residual Disease Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy pembrolizumab minimal residual disease ( MRD ) -positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity profile pembrolizumab patient previously-treated ALL . II . To gain preliminary assessment MRD response translate relapse-free overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare disease assessment multiparameter flow cytometry ( MFC ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) newly-developed sensitive next generation sequencing ( NGS ) -based platform . II . To correlate response pembrolizumab immunologic marker peripheral blood bone marrow specimen . III . To evaluate treatment pembrolizumab measurable impact hematopoietic engraftment graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) patient subsequently undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete MRD response may receive 1 additional year treatment discretion investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week 2 year .</detailed_description>
