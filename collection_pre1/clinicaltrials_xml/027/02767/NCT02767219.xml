	<brief_title>The Use Bevacizumab Modulator Wound Healing Following Trabeculectomy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pharmacological enhancement trabeculectomy use Mitomycin C ( MMC ) significantly improve success rate . Despite , patient still mount aggressive scarring response post-operatively require additional subconjunctival injection antifibrotic agent , 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) reduce scar formation reduce likelihood surgical failure . There concern agent potentially toxic may result side effect keratopathy ( loss corneal epithelium ) also painful patient . For patient show clinical evidence potential scar formation , predictable less toxic modulator wound heal desirable . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) associate angiogenesis numerous pathological situation , include tumor growth , proliferative retinopathy , rheumatoid arthritis . VEGF also think play pivotal role ocular wound heal . It mediate signal transduction cascade lead tenon 's fibroblast migration proliferation collagen gel contraction site surgery , well angiogenesis . VEGF also cause persistent vascular permeability vasodilation level exist microvessels . Vessels increase permeability typically tortuous dilate clinical appearance within conjunctiva , suggestive future excessive wound heal scar formation follow trabeculectomy . Early intervention subconjunctival injection 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) therefore often consider clinical finding apparent , order modify course wound heal . The investigator propose pilot study look effect serial injection bevacizumab ( anti-VEGF agent ) modifying wound heal response patient show early sign future failure , compare 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . The purpose pilot also gather outcome data information relate safety recruitment view power definitive study address issue .</detailed_description>
