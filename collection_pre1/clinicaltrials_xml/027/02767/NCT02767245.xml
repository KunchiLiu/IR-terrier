	<brief_summary>Thyrotoxicosis hypermetabolic state increase utilization thiamine . Thiamine deficiency observe association hyperthyroidism . Several study document thiamine treatment could improve sign symptom congestive heart failure , even improve leave ventricular ejection fraction patient without thyrotoxicosis . This pilot study aim evaluate prevalence thiamine deficiency ass improvement cardiovascular function receive thiamine supplement thyrotoxic patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thiamine Supplement Patients With Severe Hyperthyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence thiamine vitamin B1 deficiency document 21-98 % patient heart failure . Thiamine multiple effect cardiovascular system . It important hemodynamic effect circulatory system well direct positive pharmacologic effect heart . Thiamine deficiency show cause cardiac hypertrophy , depressed cardiac contractility , dysrhythmias . Thiamine particular interest management heart failure several reason . Heart failure disease elderly whose micronutrient status need attention . Heart failure patient tend inadequate nutrient intake , associate thiamine deficiency . Use loop diuretic associate loss water-soluble vitamin , include thiamine . Several study examine role thiamine supplementation patient heart failure . Clinical trial patient congestive heart failure show thiamine supplementation increase systolic , diastolic , central venous pressure , decline heart rate increase leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) . Thiamine act vasodilator reduces afterload heart , thus improve cardiac function . Thiamine also report increase diuresis natriuresis patient heart failure receive diuretic . Thyrotoxicosis considerably increase demand thiamine . In vivo study rat model demonstrate thyroid hormone direct influence mitochondrion main source energy . Thiamine various form function important coenzyme macronutrient oxidation production adenosine triphosphate . Thiamine pyrophosphate work several oxidative decarboxylation reaction catalyst reaction Krebs cycle . Therefore , thiamine seem decrease case increase tissue metabolism . In previous case report , describe possible association thyrotoxicosis thiamine deficiency patient manifest Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome . Despite lack evidence benefit thiamine therapy patient severe thyrotoxicosis thyroid storm , expert recommend thiamine conjunction supportive treatment . We aim investigate effect thiamine cardiac function patient severe thyrotoxicosis prospective , randomize , open , blind end-point study use echocardiographic well clinical endpoint .</detailed_description>
