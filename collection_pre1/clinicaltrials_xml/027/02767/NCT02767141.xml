First , employ cross sectional , observational design investigator administer in-person survey 320 adult low food secure ( VLFS ) households child . Over 1 year later , investigator repeat select question conduct depth interview cohort ( n=28 ) participant . Descriptive statistic define magnitude association among strategy . Following bivariate analysis , investigator assess interdependency factor affect relationship log-linear model . The investigator analyze interview use hierarchically order , analytical coding structure . With Qualitative Comparative Analysis ( QCA ) , investigator develop typology VLFS create model treat food security outcome .

Food safety-related risky behavior level relate intensity food pantry use participation school food program . Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) affect association soup kitchen use risky food safety behavior . Key interview construct include become short food ; cop strategy ; decision use inform choice strategy ; manage devalue social status . Improved income stability necessary condition improve food security .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Food insecurity serious issue face household United States . In 2012 , time study begin , U.S. Department Agriculture report almost 15 % U.S. households one five household child consider food insecure . Over one third experience low food security ( VLFS ) , multiple indicator disrupt eat pattern due inadequate resource . These statistic particular concern child without consistent access sufficient nutritious food show sustain disadvantage , include effect cognition , academic performance , long-term nutritional status , psychosocial development . To improve food security , household utilize three type cop strategies- ( 1 ) participate federal feeding financial assistance program ( `` safety net '' ) , ( 2 ) obtain food nongovernment Emergency Food Providers ( EFPs ) , ( 3 ) use individually develop cop strategy . The objective study related develop well understand cop strategy VLFS household child use ensure household sufficient food . Specifically , study address two main research question : What interdependencies among three type cop strategy : participate federal feeding financial assistance program ( `` safety net '' ) , obtain food EFPs , use individually develop cop strategy . What decision-making process people VLFS household child use select cop strategy ensure household sufficient food ? The investigator conduct two-phased mixed-methods study cop strategy use VLFS household child &lt; 18 year North Carolina ( NC ) , use socio-ecological theoretical framework guide hypothesis , method , analysis . For phase I , investigator employ cross sectional , observational design . The investigator use two-stage sample recruit 320 client service provider offer assistance people limited resource within eight NC county high food insecurity rate . Trained interviewer administer in-person survey interview ask client socio-demographic question use three category cop strategy . Using longitudinal design , year Phase I , Phase II , investigator complete depth interview cohort ( n=28 ) Phase I participant , select use maximum variation sample . During largely unscripted interview , participant ask select number close end question Phase I , include 18 item food security module , ass change past year permit comparison time one two . To address first question , two two multi-dimensional contingency table construct analyze interdependency among three type cop strategy outcome . Descriptive statistic ( odds ratio , count percentage ) perform define magnitude association among cop strategy . Fisher 's exact test Chi-square statistic employ assess statistical significance interdependency among outcome . To determine interdependency among three cop strategy , assess individual household-level factor affect interdependency , investigator employ log-linear model . To address second research question , investigator formulate hierarchically order , analytical coding structure reflect key decision-making construct ( e.g. , knowledge cop strategy , perception risk accessibility availability cop strategy , barrier participation `` safety net '' program ) examine result term key construct . Lastly , response set question jointly review use Qualitative Comparative Analysis ( QCA ) , mixed-methods analysis technique . The investigator implement conventional , crisp set ( 1 ) develop typology household individual experience low food insecurity , ( 2 ) explore pathway improve food security status among participant follow-up interview . All procedure involve human participant review approved RTI International 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) .</detailed_description>
