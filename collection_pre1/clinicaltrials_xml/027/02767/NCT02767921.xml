	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study side effect recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein surgery treat patient transitional cell carcinoma bladder , prostate cancer , kidney cancer . Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may block enzyme need tumor cell multiply may also prevent growth new blood vessel bring nutrient tumor . Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility , adverse event associate , treatment soluble ephrin type-B receptor 4 ( sEphB4 ) -human serum albumin ( HSA ) ( recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein ) prior minimally invasive robotic surgery patient either muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma bladder ; clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( 4 cm great ) ; prostate cancer Gleason ( 7 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tumor response neoadjuvant sEphB4 measure imaging response pathologic response . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate expression ephrin type-B receptor 4 ( EphB4 ) eph-related receptor tyrosine kinase ligand 5 ( EphrinB2 ) archival tumor sample explore potential association outcome . II . To bank specimen future correlative biomarker study base result ongoing biomarkers analyse phase I sEphB4-HSA single agent . III . To evaluate change deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation surgical specimen treat sEphB4-HSA . IV . To evaluate infiltration immune cell tumor due administer sEphB4-HSA . V. To evaluate impact sEphB4-HSA vessel density tumor tissue . VI . To assess applicability use sEphB4-HSA treat genitourinary cancer . VII . To assess applicability use contrast-enhanced ultrasound image determine pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate . OUTLINE : Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute weekly 3 week ( 3 dos ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients agree may receive fourth dose additional week determine study medical oncologist . Two four week last dose recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein , patient undergo robotic-assisted radical cystectomy robotic-assisted radical partial nephrectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
