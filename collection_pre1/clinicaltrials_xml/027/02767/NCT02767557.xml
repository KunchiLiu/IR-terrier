	<brief_title>Study Nab-Paclitaxel Gemcitabine With Without Tocilizumab Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development new effective treatment strategy remain major challenge patient PC . High level IL-6 presence systemic inflammatory response PC patient report correlate bad survival . Preclinical PC model clearly show anti-IL-6-receptor antibody tocilizumab combination chemotherapy reduce tumor growth , number distant metastases local recurrence rate . Thus , blockade IL-6-regulated signaling pathway represent promise approach combination chemotherapy . Elevated C-reactive protein ( CRP ) alone combination hypoalbuminaemia ( Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score - mGPS ) induce IL-6 could feasibly represent surrogate marker IL-6 bioactivity stratify patient likely gain benefit target IL-6 .</detailed_description>
