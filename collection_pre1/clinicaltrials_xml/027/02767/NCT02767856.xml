	<brief_summary>This study design answer question : What Intermittent Occlusion ( IO-therapy ) glass prescribe day ( 12-hours ) total time treatment take 4 week instead current treatment time ( 4 hour ) take 12 week ? Children age 3- 8-years untreated moderate unilateral amblyopia enrol randomized 2 group : 1 ) Intense 12-hour IO-therapy Group 4 week treatment ; 2 ) Standard 4-hour IO-therapy glass Group 12 week treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The following criterion must meet patient enrol study : 1 . Age 3 &lt; 8 year 2 . Unilateral amblyopia associate strabismus ( comitant incomitant ) , anisometropia , Criteria strabismus : At least one follow criterion must meet : Heterotropia distance and/or near fixation examination ( without spectacle ) History strabismus surgery Documented history strabismus longer present ( judgment investigator could cause amblyopia ) Criteria anisometropia : At least one follow criterion must meet : &gt; 0.50 D difference eye spherical equivalent &gt; 0.50 D difference eye astigmatism meridian 3 . Amblyopic eye myopia ( &gt; 0.25 D spherical equivalent ) . 4 . Visual acuity , measure eye without cycloplegia within 7 day prior enrollment use ATS singlesurround HOTV letter protocol follow : Visual acuity amblyopic eye 20/40 20/80 inclusive Visual acuity sound eye 20/32 good Intereye acuity difference â‰¥ 2 logMAR line ( i.e. , amblyopic eye acuity least 2 line bad sound eye acuity ) 5 . No previous amblyopia treatment within 6 month . 6 . Spectacle correction ( applicable ) measurement enrollment visual acuity must meet follow criterion base cycloplegic refraction within 6 month : Requirements spectacle correction : For patient meet criterion strabismus Hypermetropia correct must undercorrected +1.50 D spherical equivalent , reduction plus sphere must symmetric two eye . Otherwise , spectacle correction investigator discretion . For patient meet criterion anisometropia combinedmechanism Spherical equivalent must within 0.50 D fully correct anisometropia Hypermetropia must undercorrected +1.50 D spherical equivalent , reduction plus must symmetric two eye Cylinder power eye must within 0.50 D fully correct astigmatism Cylinder axis spectacle lenses eye must within 6 degree axis cycloplegic refraction Spectacles meeting criterion must wear either : 4 week immediately prior enrollment , visual acuity amblyopic eye stable ( defined two consecutive visual acuity measurement least 4 week apart improvement one line ) An acuity measurement do follow way may consider first two consecutive measurement : current glass , trial frame full correction hypermetropia cycloplegia , new glass . 7 . Wearing optimal spectacle correction minimum 4 week time enrollment . 8 . Ocular examination within 6 month prior enrollment . 9 . Gestational age &gt; 34 week birth weight &gt; 1500 gram 10 . Parent willing accept randomization 11 . Parent willing contacted access phone 12 . Parent anticipate relocation outside area within study period . 1 . Amblyopic eye myopia worse 3.00 D spherical equivalent . 2 . Prior intraocular refractive surgery 3 . Ocular pathology impact vision 4 . Cognitive impairment prohibits accurate data collection</criteria>
