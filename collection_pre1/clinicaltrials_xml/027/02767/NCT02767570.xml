	<brief_title>Long-Term Effectiveness Walking Training Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize control trial investigate conservative treatment individual painful knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . The study recruit participant isolate , medial compartment knee OA . Subjects assign one two gait training group . Both group undergo gait analysis determine foot progression angle comfortable walk speed . Both group receive personalize gait retrain either alter foot progression angle achieve consistency natural foot progression angle . Gait retrain consist week session six week . The gait training use fade feedback approach , percentage weekly session feedback use decrease week week feedback use last training session . Throughout six-week training period subject encourage practice gait least ten minute per day . Subjects continue practice gait throughout remainder 52-week intervention . Subjects walk activity record use 3-axis pedometer , smart shoe log foot progression angle free-living condition . Compared baseline walking activity , participant instruct increase daily walk ten minute per day throughout 52-week intervention . All subject receive monthly phone call encourage maintain regular walk regimen . Walking activity monitor periodically use pedometer . Subjects receive knee MRIs weight-bearing knee radiographs start end study . All participant complete visual analog pain evaluation clinical knee score questionnaire study . The investigator expect subject group reduction knee pain course 52-week intervention . The primary objective study determine change pain baseline week 52 different two group .</detailed_description>
