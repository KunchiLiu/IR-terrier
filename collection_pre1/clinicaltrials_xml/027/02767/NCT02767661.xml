	<brief_title>Metronomic Capecitabine Plus Aromatase Inhibitor First Line Treatment HR ( + ) , Her2 ( - ) Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial endocrine therapy ( ET ) common choice hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) , HER2 negative ( HER2- ) metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) patient good tolerability , low toxicity durable response . The median time progression ( TTP ) initial ET HR+ , HER2- metastatic patient 9 month aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) . However , metastatic patient receive ET develop resistance conventional endocrine treatment ultimately . So novel agent , like palbociclib everolimus , approve effective improve efficacy standard ET . But fact face either palbociclib everolimus focus single checkpoint pathway responsible resistance ET . In clinical , patient without activation resistance-related pathway poor response endocrine therapy . And mechanisms resistance endocrine therapy complicate fully understood . So far , novel agent completely solve clinical problem secondary drug-resistance . Maybe broad spectrum anti-cancer therapy low toxicity good tolerability practical promising near future . Metronomic chemotherapy administration low-dose chemotherapy induce disease control metastatic cancer patient , low-incidence adverse effect . More evidence show activity metronomic therapy breast cancer . Metronomic therapy without endocrine therapy metastatic neoadjuvant setting show considerable efficacy . Although concept combination chemotherapy endocrine therapy simultaneously large abandon previous use tamoxifen intravenous chemotherapy show additional benefit , good understand biology endocrine therapy metronomic chemotherapy , 's worth evaluate whether endocrine therapy plus low-dose metronomic chemotherapy bring well clinical benefit rate without sacrifice quality patient ' life . In phase III study , investigate efficacy safety low-dose capecitabine plus AI treat metastatic HR+ , HER2- postmenopausal breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
