	<brief_summary>Cognitive decline dementia become important public health issue time medical science increase lifespan society become progressively old . A great deal cognitive decline due age explained decline work memory ( WM ) , mental function central cognition age deficit appear almost universally . Attempts use WM training increase WM ability old adult success , transfer performance enhancement cause train cognitive skill controversial . Another intervention show much promise noninvasive stimulation cerebral cortex use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , show increase performance many cognitive task . Here , investigator proposes use fMRI-guided TMS enhancement paradigm stimulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , region involve maintenance item WM , also manipulation , order create WM performance enhancement long lasting transfer cognitive task well . This achieve three study . In first investigator stimulate old young healthy adult perform different WM task increasingly engage DLPFC order demonstrate enhancement WM performance great old adult . In second third study , old adult receive active sham TMS two week daily session perform WM task . In second study , investigator hope demonstrate cumulative effect multiple TMS session , tandem synergistic effect simultaneous TMS + WM training , create WM performance enhancement great find WM train alone , whose effect long-lasting , continue month follow course TMS session . In third , investigator investigate whether WM enhancement generate two week TMS session generalize cognitive task . Success study provide proof principle long-lasting , transferable effect TMS remediate WM general cognitive deficit due age , point possible non-invasive brain stimulation therapy cognitive decline healthy age dementia .</brief_summary>
