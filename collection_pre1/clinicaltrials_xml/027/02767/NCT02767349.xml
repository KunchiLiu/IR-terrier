Subject must report moderate severe acute pain ( determined Numerical Pain Rating scale ( NPRS ) 0 = pain , 10 = worst pain ; subject must level 4 ) pediatric surgical procedure ( baseline ) require hospitalization . Sponsor preapprove list acceptable surgical procedure prior study start site . Surgical procedure preapproved list may acceptable case case basis approve medical monitor ( MM ) sponsor . 4 . Subject , female childbearing potential ( defined postmenarche ) , must agree abstain unprotected sexual activity study participation 2 week study exit/early termination . 5 . Subject , male reproductive potential , must agree abstain unprotected sexual activity study participation 2 week study exit/early termination . 6 .

Subject expect require surgery could influence study outcome ( eg , ventriculoperitoneal shunt repair set hydrocephalus ) . 3 . Subject abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) unless investigator determines ECG abnormality clinically significant . 4 . Subject screen pulse oximetry read &lt; 95 % awake . 5 . Subject history laboratory test result obtain screen show presence human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody , active hepatitis A immunoglobulin M. 6 . Subject laboratory value great 2 time upper limit normal ( exception white blood cell [ WBC ] differential value ) . Enrollment subject laboratory value 1 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , low limit normal , white blood cell ( WBC ) differential &gt; 2 x ULN , leave investigator 's discretion ( increase risk participation study base upon judgment investigator ) . 7 . Subject history renal disease , opinion investigator , would contraindicate study participation ; subject significantly impaired renal function , opinion investigator evidence estimate glomerular filtration rate calculate use pediatric appropriate formula Schwartz Equation ( Schwartz et al , 2009 ) . 8 . Subject history laboratory evidence bleed clot disorder condition . 9 . Subject know suspected history alcoholism , marijuana illicit drug abuse misuse within 2 year screen evidence medical history evidence tolerance physical dependence first dose MNK155 . 10 . Subject smoke used nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen evidence medical history . 11 .

Subject previous cardiothoracic surgery ( subject history patent ductus arteriosus ligations/surgery infant acceptable ) . 14 . Subject history condition might specifically contraindicate require caution use hydrocodone bitartrate ( HB ) , acetaminophen ( APAP ) , and/or ibuprofen ( use rescue medication ) per Investigator 's Brochure ( IB ) product information per appropriate package insert . 15 . Subject history drug allergy , hypersensitivity , intolerance include HB , APAP , ibuprofen excipients , opioid drug product , opinion investigator , would place subject particular risk compromise safety subject study . 16 . Subject donate significant loss whole blood ( 480 mL ) within 30 day screen ( unless receive transfusion hematocrit hemoglobin within reference range screen ) , plan donate blood plasma course study . 17 . Subject documented history pathologic , iatrogenic surgical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise subject 's ability swallow , absorb , metabolize , excrete MNK155 , include ( limited ) intractable nausea and/or vomiting , severe GI narrowing , perforation , obstruction , bleed , gastric band surgery . 18 . Subject history GI event ( eg , perforation , obstruction , bleed ) within 6 month prior screen GI event great 6 month screen , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study participation . 19 . Subject receive investigational product device within 30 day screen , schedule receive investigational device another investigational drug ( study ) course study . 20 . Subject use product contain hydrocodone APAP within 48 hour prior first dose MNK155 . 21 . Subject history condition might specifically contraindicate require caution use administration APAP HB , include hypersensitivity HB , debilitate patient , severe impairment hepatic , pulmonary , renal function , myxedema hypothyroidism , adrenocortical insufficiency ( Addison 's disease ) , central nervous system ( CNS ) depression coma , toxic psychosis , urethral stricture , acute alcoholism , delirium tremens , severe kyphoscoliosis , biliary tract dysfunction . 22 . Subject medical condition , abnormal vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate ) , body temperature , pulse oximetry ; physical examination ECG find screening , investigator 's medical opinion , would preclude safe participation clinical study .</criteria>
