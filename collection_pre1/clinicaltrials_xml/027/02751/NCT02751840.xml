	<brief_summary>Background . The prevalence obesity increase last two decade . To maintain body weight energy expenditure ( EE ) equal energy intake ( EI ) . A low EE predispose individual weight gain obesity also result low rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) . Caffeine ( Caf ) active food ingredient widely consume globally , important impact energy balance . Caf reduce appetite ( EI ) increase EE , thus , Caf potential role body weight reduction . Caf cause high total daily energy expenditure ( TDEE ) normal weight ( NW ) people compare obese ( OW ) . Moreover Caf link decreased fat oxidation OW . There differences OW NW Caf pharmacokinetics , difference report NW OW females effect RMR . There gender difference influence Caf metabolism . The investigator aware previous study compare effect Caf RMR NW OW men . Objectives . 1 ) To compare effect Caf coffee rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) value healthy normal-weight ( NW ) men overweight ( OW ) men . 2 ) To develop Caf intake frequency questionnaire ( Hebrew ) Hypothesis . RMR value high respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) value low NW compare value measure OW men . Methods . 33 men ( 16 NW 17 OW ) report laboratory 4 separate occasion ( placebo , Caf tablet , coffee decaffeinate coffee ) . During lab session undergo complete anthropometric measurement RMR measure ( one study condition ) use indirect calorimetry . Additionally , respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) calculate ratio CO2 production ( VCO2 ) O2 consumption ( VO2 ) ( VCO2/VO2 ) , blood pressure heart rate ( HR ) response record . The importance study result contribute scientific basis weight control health intervention program ( diet physical activity ) overweight men .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods . 16 NW 17 OW men report laboratory 4 separate occasion ( placebo , Caf tablet , coffee decaffeinate coffee ) separate 2-7 day . Before first meeting refill caffeine , physical activity medical questionnaire . The investigator recruit men healthy non-smokers comorbidities daily caffeine consumption 400 mg. Before meet participant comply guideline outline include fast 8 hour , avoid intense physical activity 14 hour moderate exercise 2 hour measurement . The meeting conduct morning first session include anthropometric measurement ( weight , height waist circumference ) body composition measurement use Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA ) digital caliper . Each session begin measure rest blood pressure heart rate ( Polar telemetric system ) , participant give randomly placebo Caf tablet coffee decaffeinate coffee , wait half hour measure RMR respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) , half hour use indirect calorimetry ( canopy system ) . Then measure blood pressure heart rate rest . The sample size calculate 16 participant group , accord expect change 3 % RMR value group power 80 % significance 0.05 . standard deviation ( SD ) .</detailed_description>
