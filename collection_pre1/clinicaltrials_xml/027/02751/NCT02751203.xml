	<detailed_description>Unintentional injury lead cause death young child United States ( U.S. ) responsible child death next three cause combine , , homicide , suicide cancer . Each year approximately 9,000 child die , 250,000 hospitalize 9,000,000 child treat emergency department preventable injury ( cost around $ 87 billion medical societal cost ) . Child adolescent unintentional injury death decline extent disease , resource direct reduce child injury commensurate burden pose . More 50 % injury occur around home , young child spend time . Common cause fatal non-fatal unintentional childhood injury include : fire burn , fall , drown , poison , suffocation . For example , residential fire account nearly 90 percent fire-related death . Almost 13,000 child injured TV tip-overs year . Medications leading cause child poison . Finally , home hazard include bunk bed , high chair , window , stove oven , button battery , laundry packet , toys—ubiquitous product home feature present nearly every U.S. home . Unlike disease cancer , need wait cure ... already one . Many injury prevent use safety equipment follow safety recommendation . Using know , effective countermeasure , namely , smoke alarm , carbon monoxide detector , stair gate , cabinet lock latch , anchor TV furniture prevent reduce consequence child injure . Unfortunately , overall rate safety behavior vary/are low ( add citation ) . Barriers related identifying hazard , find credible information recommendation , obtain safety product best-suited feature home make create safe home difficult parent caregiver . Interventions increase home safety behavior range provision educational material , health care provider counseling , safety product distribution , hands-on experiential learning provide safety resource center evaluate ( vary degree effectiveness ) , however , wide-reaching intervention , reach large/substantial parent caregiver audience , need . Offering tailor safety information multiple topic via single platform , combine ability acquire safety device , efficient mean reach large segment population may help reduce aforementioned barrier . Thus urgent need mobile technologies—that , program use mobile phone tablet , include apps text messaging , portable device deliver intervention—to reduce barrier help parent identify injury hazard home , consolidate credible injury prevention recommendation , organize information room feature , tailor child age , facilitate acquisition installation safety product , encourage track progress , thereby increase likelihood parent accomplish important life-saving safety task . Our long-term goal prevent reduce consequence home-related child injury . The overall objective propose research , next step toward attainment long-term goal , preliminarily evaluate mobile technology-based health behavior change intervention , Make Safe Happen® app , improve knowledge behavior prevention unintentional child injury . Our central hypothesis parent increase safety knowledge safety behavior ( self-reported observe ) , high behavioral intention make home safer utilize Make Safe Happen® app compare control group . The rationale underlies propose research derive Health Belief Model ( HBM ) explain individual 's perception threat pose health problem ( susceptibility , severity ) , benefit avoid threat ( perceived benefit ) , factor influence decision act ( barrier , cue action , self-efficacy ) effect decision whether take action avoid injury illness ( National Cancer Institute 2005 ) . The investigator plan objectively test central hypothesis , thereby , attain objective application pursue follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 . Determine whether mobile technology-based health behavior change intervention , Make Safe Happen® app effective improve safety knowledge prevention unintentional child home-related injury , compare intervention . Our work hypothesis parent caregiver receive intervention great safety knowledge parent caregiver control group . Specific Aim 2 . Determine whether mobile technology-based health behavior change intervention , Make Safe Happen® app effective increase behavioral intention prevention unintentional child home-related injury , compare intervention alternate intervention . Our work hypothesis parent caregiver report high behavioral intention likely complete task relate `` childproofing '' `` safety proofing '' home . Specific Aim 3 . Preliminarily investigate whether mobile technology-based health behavior change intervention , Make Safe Happen® app effective improve safety behavior , acquisition use safety device prevention unintentional child home-related injury , compare intervention . Possible Exploratory Sub-Aims Sub-aim # 1 . Evaluate race ethnicity potentially important modifier impact intervention . Sub-aim # 2 : Evaluate household income potentially important modifier impact intervention . Sub-aim # 3 : notification [ NOTE : app use period 1 week long , naturally receive notification currently propose ] Sub-aim # 4 : e-health literacy ( defined ability seek , find , understand , appraise health information electronic source apply knowledge gain address solve health problem ) ( Norman Skinner 2006 ) It anticipate aims yield follow expect outcome . First , investigator expect determine effect intervention parent ' safety knowledge , thereby demonstrate utility mobile app future unintentional child home-related injury prevention . Second , investigator expect learn whether intervention increase behavioral intention complete home safety behavior safety device acquisition . Third , investigator explore whether intervention increase safety behavior , acquisition use safety device . In exploratory aim investigator begin assess whether intervention adopt differently among parent vary races/ethnicities , suggest opportunity tailor intervention maximize impact . Next , investigator establish link parent ' behavioral intention relate home injury prevention behavior device use , inform future prevention effort expansion Make Safe Happen® program app . Finally , investigator provide new insight synergism care young child provide safe home environment free hazard . These outcome expect important positive impact provide safe home environment potential prevent reduce unintentional child injury death , detail next section .</detailed_description>
