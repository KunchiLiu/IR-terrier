	<brief_summary>Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) genetic disorder cause mutation tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase gene ( TNSALP ) . It cause impaired bone mineralisation , fracture , tooth loss , muscle weakness possibly adverse health outcome . The infantile-onset form severe , often fatal recent availability treatment ( Asfotase Alfa ) . The childhood-onset form less severe , adult-onset form mild , often unrecognised misdiagnosed osteoporosis . The less severe form disease well describe , available treatment much research adult . However , treatment available possibility clinical trial adult . To know whether need trial need determine significant personal economic burden associate less severe form HPP . The study consist clinical interview note review adult child confirm ( biochemical genetic testing ) HPP attend metabolic bone clinic Sheffield establish clinical problem healthcare use . There currently 26 adult 8 child attend clinic Sheffield . The information use plan data search health economic analysis burden HPP UK Clinical Practice Research Database collaboration Pharmatelligence ( healthcare data group base within University Cardiff ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational retrospective study describe clinical problem healthcare use adult child hypophosphatasia . Interviews conduct patient childhood- adult-onset hypophosphatasia ( parent child ) . Hospital note , appointment record GP summary care record also review . These source use describe clinical problem , problem affect daily function , healthcare service use . Patients attend single visit obtain informed consent conduct interview . Health problem specifically assess detail include : - Fractures - Dental problem - Skeletal complication - Mobility problem - Neurosurgical complication - Seizures - Respiratory complication - Depression anxiety - Side effect treatment include hypercalcaemia hyperphosphataemia Deaths also record Health care resource assessment include - Primary care episodes - Secondary tertiary care outpatient episodes - In-patient episode - Nutritional support - Therapy support - Dental treatment - Over counter medication use A case data report form develop iterative process period interview ensure data potential interest capture . Because condition well describe important data report limited area might already expect find problem .</detailed_description>
