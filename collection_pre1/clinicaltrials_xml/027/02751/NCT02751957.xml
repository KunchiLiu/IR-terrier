	<brief_summary>This Mentored Career Development Award lay foundation career focus address 2 specific Grand Challenges Global Mental Health priority : 1 ) improve child access evidence-based mental health care , 2 ) reduce duration untreated illness develop culturally-sensitive early intervention . The propose research aim assess acceptability , feasibility , impact brief caregiver-mediated early autism intervention adapt use low resource setting . Data pilot study would inform scalable early autism intervention program implementation underserved , low resource , low-literacy population globally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Improve Access Early Intervention Autism Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In proposal , investigator 's aim adapt parent-mediated version Early Start Denver Model ( P-ESDM ) conduct pilot study explore impact adapt intervention child caregiver outcome African setting . Importantly , work aligns objective Federal Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan : support community-based study ass effectiveness intervention broader community setting include scalable early intervention program implementation underserved , low-resource , low-literacy population ( 12 ) . The Early Start Denver Model ( ESDM ) ( 15 ) first empirically-validated comprehensive intervention toddler Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) . In study P-ESDM parallel propose study , Vismara et al ( 2009 ) demonstrate brief 12 week , 1 hour per week , P-ESDM program parent toddler ASD , one parent study acquire mastery ESDM technique 85 percent criterion fifth sixth intervention session measure ESDM fidelity scale . Furthermore , high level correct implementation ESDM technique maintain follow-up parent meet fidelity complete program , average percent accuracy range 93-97 % . The brief intervention also result sustained positive growth child social communicative behavior ( see Figure 1 ) ( 31 ) . More recently , NIH-funded randomize control trial ( RCT ) , Rogers et al ( 2012 ) find P-ESDM community intervention associate increase language cognitive outcome decrease ASD symptom , despite fact community intervention involve great number intervention hour ( 32 ) . Specifically , 10-point increase verbal developmental quotient ( DQ ) , 4-5 point increase overall DQ , decrease social affect symptom Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule ( ADOS ) find . Moreover , intervention result low level parent stress ( 33 ) . The site propose study Center Autism Research Africa University Cape Town ( Director , de Vries ) . South Africa offer unique opportunity study interaction among treatment , child , family , community context , thus provide preliminary information could help match right treatment right child/family . In recent multisite P-ESDM RCT Estes colleague ( 33 ) report parent-mediated intervention help maintain parental adjustment directly child diagnosed ASD . However , number negative life event significant predictor parent stress sense competence . Child caregiver factor , particularly prevalent South Africa ( eg . poverty , malnutrition , HIV/AIDS ) , know affect child cognitive social-emotional development ( 35 ) , well parent stress . Gathering data feasibility impact scalable early ASD intervention environment significant child caregiver contextual challenge exist , offer unique opportunity examine broad contextual factor involve cultural adaptation ASD early intervention . The investigator therefore document effect broader contextual factor ( e.g . caregiver mental health , negative life event , HIV/AIDS , poverty , see Table 3 : Measures ) treatment impact . In addition , study understanding implement mental health early intervention low middle-income country ( LMIC ) context , examine process use train , supervise , support counsel provider context . The long term goal proposal advance understand affordable , sustainable early intervention strategy developmental disorder , include ASD would benefit family regardless resource availability . Specific Aim # 1 : Adapt P-ESDM treatment manual training approach . P-ESDM brief , scalable caregiver-mediated early autism intervention . Specific Aim # 2 : Pre-pilot adapt P-ESDM intervention refine methodological detail experimental protocol . A pre-pilot P-ESDM conduct 6 preschool age child ASD . Specific Aim # 3 : Pilot RCT adapt P-ESDM 40 preschool age child ASD explore impact : ) child communication ability overall developmental outcome , measure language subscale composite score Griffith Mental Developmental Scales , b ) ASD social symptom , measure ADOS Social Affect score , c ) caregiver stress , measure Parenting Stress Index . Preliminary Studies/Data : Critical success sustainability project establishment collaborative relationship local researcher clinician South Africa , share goal enhance ASD service broad South African African community ( see de Vries letter support ) . In 2012 Center Autism Research Africa University Cape Town found Dr. de Vries , primary in-country mentor . The Center aim promote collaboration develop capacity across African continent ( 37 ) . Dr. de Vries certify trainer ASD 'gold standard ' diagnostic assessment African continent . He undertaken translation ADOS-2 ADI-R : ( 1 ) isiXhosa Afrikaans , two common language Western Cape Province ; ( 2 ) Kiswahili use East Africa . Work improve access service also begin . Three clinician Center Autism Research Africa train ESDM . They conduct preliminary work 34 ethnically diverse preschool-age child ASD . Using unadapted version ESDM , follow 12 week , 1 hour per week P-ESDM format , report high retention rate suggest P-ESDM may feasible approach low resource setting ( 37 ) . Children participate pre-pilot ESDM work recruit Western Cape Education Department autism wait list . This work help establish feasibility recruit young child propose study .</detailed_description>
