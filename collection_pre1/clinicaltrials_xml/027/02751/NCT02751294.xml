	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect Tafenoquine ( TQ ) 150 mg tablet ageing ( dissolution profile ) human exposure TQ compare relative bioavailability TQ tablets exhibit different dissolution profile healthy subject . This single-centre , 2-arm , randomized open-label , parallel-group study healthy subject . All subject arrive unit approximately 24 hour prior dose discharge 72-hour post-dose assessment complete . Subjects return outpatient visit Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 56 dosing . A total 14 subject ( n=7 subject arm ) plan enrol . All subject receive single dose study medication ( 2x150 mg TQ tablets + 30 mg TQ SIL solution ) participate 56-day post dose follow-up visit . To enable application peripheral microsampling plan paediatric study , comparison measure pharmacokinetic ( PK ) exposure via peripheral blood collection ( via microsampling ) venous collection also perform study .</brief_summary>
