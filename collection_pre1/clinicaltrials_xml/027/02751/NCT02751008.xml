	<brief_summary>Low bone mass osteoporosis underdiagnosed childhood environment prevalence unknown . In case secondary chronic disease conduct poor bone health condition thereby risk fracture increase . The aim study identify patient risk factor low bone mass determine Bone Mineral Density ( amount bone ) perform bone densitometry compare healthy population characteristic . Also investigator want evaluate bone quality application Trabecular Bone Score image obtain densitometry . As secondary objective investigator intend correlate data clinical variable identify important bone health clinical factor . In addition measure bone quality quantity demographic clinical process relate bone quality base variable collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis ( OP ) child rare disease whose incidence unknown , partly due lack diagnosis associate absence specific clinical symptom early stage disease . That active recognition disease pediatrician pediatrician rheumatologist essential prevent future complication : fracture comorbidity associate , include possible deformity need surgical correction . The diagnosis OP child adolescents require combination densitometric criterion ( low bone mass deficit mineralization ) clinical judgment clinically significant fracture . Any following fracture consider clinically significant fracture : Long bone fracture lower limb , vertebral compression fracture , two long bone fracture upper extremity . Low bone mass age consider Z-score measurement bone mineral density ( BMD ) less equal -2 , adjust age , sex body mass index . The Z-score value calculate subtracting average patient BMD BMD age group gender value divide standard deviation age group gender . DXA ( dual-energy X ray absortiometry ) lumbar whole body ( exclude head ) method choice measure bone mineral density ( BMD ) , since accurate skeletal location reproducible measuring BMD . Juvenile Idiopathic Osteoporosis rare entity , less 200 case described literature , whose diagnosis require exclusion secondary form osteoporosis . Among cause osteoporosis ( low bone mass ) secondary child population investigator : kidney disease , metabolic disease , hematological , endocrinological , gastrointestinal rheumatological , include chronic systemic disorder . The transplant cancer patient generally multifactorial risk osteoporosis ( immobilization , medical treatment , etc. ) . Also , nutritional cause another large block secondary form child / juvenile ( low bone mass age ) osteoporosis . Typical example malabsorptive disease celiac disease , cystic fibrosis chronic inflammatory bowel disease anorexia nervosa . Special attention pediatric patient treat nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , methotrexate , course , glucocorticoid , potent inducer inhibitor osteoclastogenesis osteoblastogenesis . Other medication affect great risk develop osteoporosis : anticonvulsant , anticoagulant chemotherapy . According ISCD ( International Society Clinical Densitometry ) perform DXA bone densitometry measure bone health assessment child increase risk fracture . They therefore candidate bone densitometry pediatric patient primary bone diseases potential secondary bone disease ( eg , pre-transplant chronic inflammatory disease , endocrine disorder , cancer history ) . While DXA validate technique today indirect measurement fracture risk able analyze change bone mineral content , recently intensify effort validate technique possible assess quantity also quality bone . Among highlight TBS ( Trabecular Bone Score ) software apply directly information obtain spinal DXA analyze trabecular number , thickness connectivity , provide extra information strength weakness vertebra . Its use spread routine clinical practice adult population safe increase time required exploration , however pediatric population include routine practice even though application could provide additional information DMO base treatment decision .</detailed_description>
