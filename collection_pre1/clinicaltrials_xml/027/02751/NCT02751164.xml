	<brief_title>Evaluation Association Between Day Time Admission Critical Care Acute Hospital Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Objective To conduct analysis Case Mix Programme database evaluate association day time admission critical care acute hospital outcome unplanned admission National Health Service adult , general critical care unit England , Wales Northern Ireland . 2 . Exposure The primary exposure variable day time admission critical care unit , divide week 14 time period : Monday 08:00-17:59 ; Monday 18:00-Tuesday 07:59 ; Tuesday 08:00-17:59 , etc . For summary table , collapse follow category : - Weekday daytime : Monday-Friday 08:00-17:59 - Weekend daytime : Saturday-Sunday 08:00-17:59 - Weekday night : Monday-Friday 18:00-07:59 next day - Weekend night : Saturday-Sunday 18:00-07:59 next day 3 . Outcome The primary outcome acute hospital mortality , define death ultimate discharge acute hospital . 4 . Key confounders The key potential confounders adjust analysis : - Age - Severe condition past medical history - Prior dependency - Number day hospital admission critical care unit admission - Location prior admission - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) within 24 hour prior admission critical care - Primary reason admission critical care - Acute severity illness - Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre ( ICNARC ) Physiology Score Age define age whole year time admission critical care unit include model linear term . Severe condition past medical history define accord Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II methodology must evident document six month prior admission critical care unit . Conditions categorise seven binary covariates : - Severe cardiovascular disease - fatigue , claudication , dyspnoea angina rest ( New York Heart Association functional class IV ) - Severe respiratory disease - shortness breath light activity due pulmonary disease home ventilation - End-stage renal failure - requirement chronic renal replacement therapy irreversible renal disease - Severe liver disease - biopsy proven cirrhosis , portal hypertension hepatic encephalopathy - Haematological malignancy - acute chronic myelogenous/lymphocytic leukaemia , multiple myeloma lymphoma - Metastatic disease - distant metastasis document surgery , image biopsy - Immunocompromise - radiotherapy , chemotherapy , daily high-dose steroid , HIV/AIDS congenital immuno-humoral cellular immune deficiency state Prior dependency assess base ability perform usual daily activity ( e.g . bathing , dress , go toilet , move in/out bed/chair , continence eat ) two week prior admission acute hospital prior onset acute illness , categorise : - Able live without assistance daily activity - Some ( minor/major ) assistance daily activity - Total assistance daily activity The number day acute hospital admission critical care unit admission categorise 0 day ( i.e . admission critical care unit calendar day admission hospital ) , 1 day , 2 day , 3-7 day 8 day . Location prior admission critical care unit categorise : - Emergency department/not hospital - Theatre ( emergency/urgent surgery ) - Ward , obstetric area intermediate care area Patients admit transient area ( e.g . imaging , specialist treatment area , recovery ) assign category accord previous location . CPR within 24 hour prior admission critical care define receipt internal external cardiac massage ( without defibrillation ) categorise either in-hospital ( administer in-hospital resuscitation team equivalent ) , out-of-hospital CPR . The primary reason admission critical care unit record use ICNARC Coding Method , hierarchical cod method specifically design record reason admission critical care . For descriptive table , primary reason admission categorise accord body system ( respiratory , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , neurological , genitourinary , endocrine musculoskeletal/dermatological ) . For model , primary reason admission categorise accord body system pathological/physiological process ( e.g . respiratory infection ) , category contain few 100 admission combine body system level . Acute severity illness assess use ICNARC Physiology Score base highest/lowest value 12 physiological parameter first 24 hour follow admission critical care unit . The APACHE II Score also report descriptor severity illness include model due collinearity age , past medical history physiology . Delayed admission critical care unit ( defined delay least one hour document decision admit patient critical care unit actual admission , subcategorised delay 4 hour versus 4 hour ) explore potential mediator effect day/time admission outcome . 5 . Handling miss data From previous analysis high-quality clinical database , level miss data anticipate low . Patients miss primary outcome key confounders ( age , location prior admission , primary reason admission ) therefore exclude analysis . Patients miss binary/categorical confounders/mediators assume low risk category ( i.e . severe condition past medical history , assistance daily activity , CPR , delay ) . Following standard approach , miss physiological parameter assume normal assign zero point ICNARC Physiology Score ( except patient miss physiology , exclude ) . 6 . Analysis Flow diagram study inclusion Number admission day/time admission ( 1-hour category ) Number admission day/time admission ( 14 category use analysis ) Characteristics include patient broad category day/time admission : - Age mean ( SD ) - Sex n ( % ) - Severe condition past medical history ( cardiovascular , respiratory , renal , liver , haematological malignancy , metastatic disease , immunosuppression ) n ( % ) - Prior dependency ( no/some/total assistance daily activity ) n ( % ) - Number day hospital admission critical care unit admission ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3-7 , &gt; 7 ) n ( % ) - Location prior admission critical care ( ED/not hospital , theatre , ward/intermediate care ) n ( % ) - Delayed admission critical care ( delay , 4 hour , &gt; 4 hour ) n ( % ) - Duration delay ( hour ) median ( IQR ) - CPR within 24 hour prior admission critical care ( , in-hospital , out-of-hospital ) n ( % ) - Primary reason admission critical care ( body system ) n ( % ) - ICNARC Physiology Score mean ( SD ) - APACHE II Score mean ( SD ) - Critical care unit outcome n ( % ) - Critical care unit length stay stratify outcome median ( IQR ) - Acute hospital outcome n ( % ) - Acute hospital length stay stratify outcome median ( IQR ) Logistic regression modelling , report odds ratio 95 % confidence interval . Three multilevel logistic regression model fit outcome acute hospital mortality ( include random effect critical care unit ) : 1 . Unadjusted model single covariate day/time admission ( 8-hour category ) 2 . Adjusted follow additional covariates : - Age ( linear ) - Severe condition past medical history ( binary ) - Prior dependency ( categorical ) - Number day hospital admission critical care unit admission ( categorical ) - Location prior admission ( categorical ) - CPR prior admission ( categorical ) - Primary reason admission ( categorical : body system pathological/ physiological process ) - ICNARC Physiology Score ( linear ) 3 . Including additional covariate delay admission ( delay , 4 hour delay , &gt; 4 hour delay ) evaluate mediation effect day/time admission The following hypothesis test conduct model : - The global effect day/time admission ( test homogeneity ) - A comparison weekend ( Sat 08:00-Mon 07:59 ) versus weekday ( Mon 08:00-Sat 07:59 ) - A comparison night ( 18:00-07:59 ) versus daytime ( 08:00-17:59 ) - A comparison weekend daytime ( Sat-Sun 08:00-17:59 ) versus weekday daytime ( Mon-Fri 08:00-17:59 ) - A comparison weekend night ( Sat-Sun 18:00-07:59 next day ) versus weekday night ( Mon-Fri 18:00-07:59 next day ) Post-estimation marginal predict mortality hold covariates value observe dataset ( zero random effect ) report day/time admission ( 14 category )</detailed_description>
