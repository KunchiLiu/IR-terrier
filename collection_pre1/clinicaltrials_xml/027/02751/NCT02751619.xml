	<brief_summary>Thoracotomy one painful surgical incision . Uncontrolled acute post-thoracotomy pain reduce deep breathing exercise secretion clearance increase incidence postoperative pulmonary complication include atelectasis , hypoxemia , postoperative pulmonary infection . Thus , effective analgesia crucial order reduce perioperative morbidity hospitalization time also prevent chronic post-thoracotomy pain . Thoracic epidural analgesia thoracic paravertebral analgesia currently standard strategy thoracic surgery difficult perform patient potential complication factor limit use . Systemic administration opioids simplest common strategy provide analgesia may associate several undesirable effect , respiratory depression , sedation , nausea , constipation vomit . In recent year , preventive analgesia become one promise strategy postoperative pain control . It base concept administer analgesic drug occurrence nociceptive input order prevent central sensitization . The efficacy preemptive analgesia unclear consensus efficacy control pain thoracic procedure . Pain follow thoracotomy multifactorial genesis include surgical incision , intercostal nerve injury , pleural inflammation , damage pulmonary parenchyma diaphragm . Thus , multimodal analgesia intercept signalize numerous location could effective single strategy target one site along pain pathway . Thus , present study , clinical hypothesis preemptive analgesia skin use new tool Lidocaine patch 5 % would improve analgesic effect systemic morphine analgesia control post-operative pain follow thoracotomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventive Skin Analgesia With Lidocaine Patch 5 % Controlling Post-thoracotomy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This unicenter , double-blinded , placebo control , parallel-group , prospective study conduct Thoracic Surgery Unit Anesthesia Intensive Care Unit Second University Naples January 2013 May 2015 . All consecutive patient undergo undergoing anatomical resection standard lateral thoracotomy treatment non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) randomly assign Lidocaine Placebo group 1:1 ratio change methods trial commencement type randomization eligibility criterion attend . For patient assigned active group , Lidocaine patch 5 % ( Lidoderm® , Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc , Malvern , PA , USA ) measure 10 x 14 cm contain 700 mg Lidocaine , apply cover plan skin incision , mark pen surgeon . Patch apply 12 hour night , remove subsequent 12 hour day , new patch apply level night . This process continue 3 day thoracotomy . In control group , placebo patch , identical appearance active patch contain Lidocaine , apply manner time . The pain service , surgical team , patient blind treatment group assign . All patient receive anesthetic protocol . All operation perform early morning patch remove . The general anesthesia induct i.v . midazolam 0.05 mg/kg , i.v . fentanyl 1-1.4 µg/Kg , i.v . propofol 2.5 mg/kg , i.v . rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg . The patient maintain desflurane 4-6 % , sulfentanil 0.5-1 micro/Kg , rocuronium bromide 0.6-0.8 mg/Kg , base heart rate blood pressure stability . A selective ventilation perform double-lumen endobronchial tube case additional analgesic inject surgery . All patient length skin incision standard muscle-sparing lateral thoracotomy . The latissimus dorsi muscle underlie serratus anterior muscle spar chest enter top unresected unshingled sixth rib . A standard Finocchietto chest retractor place slowly open avoid rib fracture . After completion appropriate anatomical lung resection , single 28 F chest drainage systematically place pleural cavity . The chest closure perform patient standard manner use intracostal suture . Patient extubated operating room transfer surgical ward . The postoperative analgesia perform intravenous morphine administer Patient Controlled-Analgesia ( Automed 3300 , AceMedical Co. ) delivery . Morphine 1 mg give request continuous infusion rate 1 mg/h . Both group 10 min lockout period safe high limit 20 mg 4 hour . If VAS score exceed 4/10 score , rescue analgesia intravenously administer accord standardized institutional protocol pain treatment pain relieve level fall VAS score &lt; 4 . Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) continue 2 day , patient could tolerate oral opioid medication and/or anti-inflammatory analgesic . However , medication consider analysis . The intergroup difference assess order evaluate whether pre-emptive analgesia obtain Lidocaine patch would effect pain score ( primary end-point ) , consumption analgesic , recovery respiratory function peripheral painful pathway ( secondary end-points ) .</detailed_description>
