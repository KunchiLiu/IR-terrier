	<brief_summary>This single-centre , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled , 6-treatment , 4-period crossover , incomplete block design , situ caries study healthy adult wear removable bilateral mandibular partial denture . The denture modify accommodate 4 gauze-covered specimen human dental enamel ( 4x3mm ) previously demineralize vitro form either S low-R lesion ( 2 specimen lesion type use participant ) . After 14 day twice daily product use off-site , 2 S lesion specimens remove study site , remain 2 low-R lesion specimen remove study site 14 day product use . To determine remineralization ability treatment , specimen analyze transverse microradiography ( TMR ) enamel fluoride uptake ( EFU ) , S lesions additionally analyzed surface micro hardness ( SMH ) low-R lesion additionally analyze quantitative light fluorescence ( QLF ) .</brief_summary>
