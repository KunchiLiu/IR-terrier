	<brief_summary>The investigator primary objective determine acute normovolemic hemodilution ( ANH ) pediatric cardiac surgical patient decrease volume blood product transfuse surgery immediate post-operative period compare usual care . This study enroll 24 pediatric heart surgery patient , age 6 month 3 year old undergoing either ANH prior initiate cardiopulmonary bypass standard care procedure use cardiopulmonary bypass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood transfusion associate bad outcome pediatric cardiac surgical patient . The major complication associate include increase blood loss surgery , kidney disease require dialysis , abnormal coagulation profile , increase vasopressor use , increased time spend ventilator intensive care unit . One strategy minimize blood product administration acute normovolemic hemodilution ( ANH ) . The investigator primary aim determine ANH pediatric cardiac surgical patient decrease volume blood product transfuse surgery immediate post-operative period , compare usual care . The investigator design randomize , control , open label study equally assign 24 pediatric cardiac surgery patient age 6 month 3 year two group receive either ANH prior initiate cardiopulmonary bypass usual standard care . Participants ANH arm study 10 ml/kg blood remove follow anesthetic induction . In order maintain normal circulating volume , collect blood replace equal volume 5 % albumin . All participant treat standardized protocol aim blood conservation include use retrograde arterial antegrade venous perfusion , small circuit size , intraoperative red blood cell salvage , low hemoglobin target trigger transfusion .</detailed_description>
