	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient develop bortezomib lenalidomide-resistant disease poor survival median 9 month , indicate new agent urgently need . Recent study show daratumumab single agent effective well tolerate heavily pretreated MM patient . However , approximately 60 % patient achieve partial response , ultimately patient develop progressive disease daratumumab therapy . The investigator demonstrate level target antigen CD38 , expression level complement inhibitory protein CD55 CD59 determine susceptibility MM cell towards daratumumab . In addition , MM cell low CD38 expression level high level CD55/CD59 time progression . Importantly , all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) upregulates CD38 level downregulates CD55/CD59 level MM cell , daratumumab naïve cell cell resistant daratumumab previous exposure drug . These alteration expression explain strong synergy ATRA daratumumab , MM cell derive daratumumab naïve patient patient daratumumab-refractory disease . These data form preclinical rationale clinical evaluation ATRA daratumumab MM patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient develop bortezomib lenalidomide-resistant disease poor survival median 9 month . This clearly illustrate new anti-MM agent need different mechanism action . Importantly , daratumumab monotherapy effective well tolerate heavily pre-treated lenalidomide bortezomib-refractory myeloma patient . However , approximately 60 % patient achieve partial response , ultimately patient , also achieve complete response , develop progressive disease daratumumab therapy . Factors determine susceptibility MM cell daratumumab include level target antigen CD38 , expression level complement inhibitory protein CD55 CD59 . At time progression , reduce level CD38 MM cell , whereas CD55 CD59 level increase . This indicate factor also involve development daratumumab-resistant disease . Importantly , ATRA upregulates CD38 level downregulates CD55/CD59 level MM cell , daratumumab naïve cell cell resistant daratumumab previous exposure drug . These alteration expression explain strong synergy ATRA daratumumab , MM cell derive daratumumab naïve patient patient daratumumab-refractory disease . These data form preclinical rationale clinical evaluation ATRA daratumumab MM patient . The investigator treat relapsed/refractory MM patient two stage . The first stage ( part A ) consist treatment daratumumab monotherapy . In case patient progressive disease cycle 1 , less minimal response cycle 2 , less partial response cycle 3 ( unless ongoing response ) single agent daratumumab , case patient progress daratumumab therapy previous response , ATRA add daratumumab ( part B ) . The aim study develop safe ATRA daratumumab combination suitable clinical use evaluation subsequent randomize clinical trial . To end , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ATRA daratumumab determine patient relapsed/refractory disease , treat daratumumab fail achieve partial response , develop progressive disease daratumumab treatment . This follow second part investigator examine effectivity toxicity profile combination MTD .</detailed_description>
