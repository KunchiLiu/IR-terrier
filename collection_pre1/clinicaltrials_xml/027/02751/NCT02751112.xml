	<detailed_description>The Hematopoietic Stem Cell ( HSC ) graft curative treatment lot hematologic disease , malignant , particularly leukemia . The acute Graft versus Host ( aGvH ) reaction frequent complication , could concern 50 % recipient . It mainly link immune characteristic donor act versus graft recipient . There huge need technology could predict risk aGvH , especially order select donor case several possibility , order reduce morbidity mortality graft . The Predictor ' kit allow predict acute severe form Graft versus Host disease graft peripheral hematological stem cell , assesment iNKT cell expansion .</detailed_description>
