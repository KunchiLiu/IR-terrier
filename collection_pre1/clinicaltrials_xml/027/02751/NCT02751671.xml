	<brief_summary>Background : The investigator recently evaluate new bladder stimulation technique obtain clean-catch urine infant age less six month . In study , report success rate 52 % . Measuring transversal bladder diameter prior procedure emergency point-of-care ultrasound ( ePOCUS ) could likely increase success rate technique describe bladder scan prior perform urethral catheterization . Objective : The aim study evaluate use emergency point-of-care ultrasound measure bladder volume improve clean-catch urine collection success patient less 6 month age compare child undergo technique without prior ultrasound . Methods : This randomize controlled trial perform tertiary paediatric emergency department . Participants include infant young 6 month age need urinary culture and/or analysis request attend physician . The intervention consist use emergency point-of-care ultrasound train research assistant . The primary outcome rate success procedure . Secondary objective evaluate time collect urine sample determine transversal bladder diameter correlate 90 % success rate procedure . Independent variable sex age . In group , train research nurse collect clean-catch urine sample use bladder stimulation technique . The success rate CCU procedure group calculate . The time require collect urine sample analyse . In group 1 , investigator determine transversal bladder diameter correspond success rate procedure &gt; 80 % . It estimate , worse-case scenario , evaluation 200 participant provide 95 % confidence interval small 10 % proportion . In addition , 20 participant successful CCU sample would allow evaluate 2 risk factor use univariate multivariate analysis . Expected result : This study demonstrate use emergency point-of-care ultrasound increase success rate stimulate clean-catch manoeuvre may avoid invasive urethral catheterization young child .</brief_summary>
