	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open-label , randomize , multiple dose , varied administration regimen study 2 part ( Parts A B ) . Part A utilize ascending dose cohort design sequential cohort . Each cohort evaluate DSMB safety . Additional cohort may add DSMB order determine optimal dose . Approximately 80 subject assign sequentially 1 follow dosing cohort ( 20 subject per cohort ) randomize 4:1 ratio ( active : placebo ) within cohort . Randomization stratify 2 HBeAg positive subject assign receive placebo . The cohort receive 100 200 mg SB 9200 must contain least 12 subject HBeAg positive . - SB 9200 25 mg match placebo administer QD 12 week treatment . All subject receive tenofovir 300 mg QD additional 12 week treatment . - SB 9200 50 mg match placebo administer QD 12 week treatment . All subject receive tenofovir 300 mg QD additional 12 week treatment . - SB 9200 100 mg match placebo administer QD 12 week treatment . All subject receive tenofovir 300 mg QD additional 12 week treatment . - SB 9200 200 mg match placebo administer QD 12 week treatment . All subject receive tenofovir 300 mg QD additional 12 week treatment . - Based data first 4 cohort recommendation DSMB , fifth cohort may necessary enroll . Another 20 subject may administer SB 9200 match placebo administer QD 12 week . All subject receive tenofovir 300 mg QD additional 12 week treatment . After informed consent obtain , subject enter Screening period , last 28 day . Once eligibility criterion confirm subject randomize , subject receive IP placebo 2-week supply capsule . All randomized subject receive IP match placebo total 12 week . No 2 HBeAg positive subject receive placebo per randomization scheme . Subjects start treatment period Day 1 . The PK sample collect Day 1 predose , 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 hour ( predose follow day ) . At Week 6 , sample time use collect PK sample subject collect steady state PK data . Subjects return biweekly entire 12-week IP treatment period , except begin IP administration , safety assessment include physical examination laboratory sample analysis chemistry , hematology , urine . Sample collection efficacy collect visit . A sample genotyping collect Day 1 . Sample collection Locarnini biomarkers biomarkers also occur predose Day 1 ; Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 14 ; End Study Visit . Samples cytokine level collect predose Day 1 , Week 6 , Week 12 . At Week 12 , end IP administration , subject return clinic administer IP 300 mg tenofovir . Samples collect explore potential drug-drug interaction SB 9200 tenofovir . All subject predose PK sample take take last dose IP / placebo together first dose tenofovir . Pharmacokinetic sample collect SB 9200 tenofovir 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 hour . Thereafter , subject receive tenofovir 300 mg QD additional 12 week 4-week supply . All subject return clinic Weeks 13 , 14 , 16 , 20 , 24 . Subjects safety assessment include symptom-directed physical examination safety hematology , biochemistry , virological study perform visit . After randomization study , subject eligible enroll separate extension study receive treatment tenofovir 52 week . In Extension Period , subject return clinic standard care ( SOC ) visit every 3 month laboratory test liver function virological efficacy include HBsAg , HBeAg , HBeAb HBV DNA . No study relate test perform . Safety report subject cohort continue subject first consent participate study 24-week duration IP placebo SOC tenofovir monotherapy Extension Period 30 day last dose administer . Part B utilize open-label , randomize , combination therapy design . The study design evaluate safety , tolerability , antiviral response choose dose regimen Part A administer 12 week , either alone combination tenofovir 300 mg QD . Randomization stratify base HBeAg status ( +/- ) , HBV viral load ( &lt; 10 ( 6 ) ≥ 10 ( 6 ) IU/mL ) , HBsAg baseline level ( &lt; 10 ( 3 ) ≥ 10 ( 3 ) IU/mL ) . Two 5 arm administer 2 optimal dose regimen monotherapy SB 9200 . Two 5 arm Part B administer 2 optimal dos Part A tenofovir 300 mg QD . The fifth arm administer tenofovir 300 mg QD monotherapy . In Part B , subject meet inclusion criterion randomize 1:1:1:1:1 fashion 1 5 treatment cohort 40 subject per cohort : - SB 9200 optimal dose 1 PART A alone - SB 9200 optimal dose 2 PART A alone - SB 9200 optimal dose 1 PART A administer tenofovir 300 mg QD - SB 9200 optimal dose 2 PART A administer tenofovir 300 mg QD - Tenofovir alone , 300 mg QD Subjects enrol Screening period , last 28 day . Once eligibility criterion confirm , subject receive IP 2-week supply capsule tenofovir give 4-week supply . Subjects require take IP per protocol 12 week . During 12-week treatment period , subject return clinic biweekly interval , except begin IP administration , safety assessment include physical examination laboratory sample analysis chemistry , hematology , urine . Sample collection Locarnini biomarkers occur Day 1 ; Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 14 ; End Study Visit . Sample collection cytokine level biomarkers immune response plasma sample also occur predose Day 1 Weeks 6 12 . Sample collection population PK analysis also collect predose Day 1 , 2 hour postdose Day 1 , Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 . Additional arm combination therapy may add explore different frequency administration . Depending data collect Part A , additional confirmatory arm may necessary . At Week 12 , subject administer tenofovir 300 mg QD additional 12 week , 4-week supply tenofovir . All subject return clinic Weeks 13 , 14 , 16 , 20 , 24 . Subjects safety assessment include symptom-directed physical examination safety hematology , biochemistry , virological study perform visit . After randomization study , subject eligible enroll separate extension study receive treatment tenofovir 52 week . In Extension Period , subject return clinic SOC visit every 3 month laboratory test liver function virological efficacy include HBsAg , HBeAg , HBeAb , HBV DNA . No study-related testing perform . Any subject randomize Part A Part B may consent take part 12-month Extension Period . Before study-related procedure perform , subject study procedure explain , include information regard nature study , subject must sign informed consent/assent form . During Extension Period , subject receive tenofovir return visit every 3 month follow-up safety efficacy assessment .</detailed_description>
