	<brief_summary>This study build evidence importance use safe drinking water nutritional treatment child affect Severe Acute Malnutrition ( SAM ) . The following hypothesis test : 1.The addition safe drinking water SAM treatment reduce exposure pathogen cause diarrhoeal disease , thereby reduce diarrhoea incidence among enrolled child . 2.Reductions pathogen exposure diarrhoeal disease result short recovery pe-riods child SAM . The study evaluate effectiveness safe drinking water reduce SAM treatment cost duration provide recommendation improve SAM treatment protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A four group randomize control trial ( RCT ) use evaluate effectiveness safe drinking water SAM treatment protocol . Intervention group include : 1 ) standard SAM treatment ( control group ) ; 2 ) standard SAM treatment + flocculent-disinfectant water treatment ( P &amp; G Purifier Water ) ; 3 ) standard SAM treatment + chlorine disinfectant ( `` Aquatabs '' , locally available mass market product ) ; 4 ) standard SAM treatment + ceramic water filter ( locally available mass market product ) . All intervention group receive standard SAM nutrition treatment hygiene education . The control group receive standard Community Managed Acute Malnutrition ( CMAM ) treatment household use exist water treatment method represent conventional CMAM program enable comparison study arm ( improved water provision method ) . A RCT identify rigorous gold standard methodology design feasible give context , appropriate determine whether safe drinking water effective CMAM program . Site level randomization use preferable individual randomization management perspective increase likelihood fidelity plan intervention . Limitations propose design include 1 ) potential bias study blind 2 ) possible contamination comparison group . In order minimize risk , effort make geographically separate comparison group reduce risk share water treatment product . Blinding possible give obviously different nature three PoU water treatment approach need control group .</detailed_description>
