	<brief_title>EEG Mapping During High Frequency/High Density Spinal Cord Stimulation Patients With Failed Back Surgery Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based reimbursement rule Belgium , trial implantation 4 week necessary implant definitive neurostimulator . The definitive neurostimulator implant minimum 4 week trial implantation , patient report 50 % pain reduction and/or 50 % reduction pain medication . Patients include study four extra study visit University Hospital Brussels . The first assessment take place week prior surgery , second minimal one month definitive implantation stimulator . The assessment consist fill Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) Pain Catastrophizing Scale ( PCS ) record brain activity pain protocol . Additionally , patient wear Actiwatch measure sleep pattern fill VAS diary ( back leg pain separately ) , one month baseline assessment one month second assessment .</detailed_description>
