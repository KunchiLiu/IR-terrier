	<brief_summary>This single-center , cross-sectional survey sensory examination conduct determine prevalence , sensory characteristic risk factor PPSP patient underwent cystectomy Washington University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital 2009 2015 .

	<brief_title>Persistent Pain After Cystectomy Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , open radical cystectomy ( ORC ) urinary diversion standard treatment patient muscle-invasive organ-confined bladder cancer . ORC involve complete resection local metastatic disease reconstruction functional urinary tract . Additionally , minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery show safe alternative open radical cystectomy . A total 29,719 patient underwent form cystectomy United States 2009 2011 . Both cystectomy procedure require midline incision pubic symphysis , virtually surgical incision , produce tissue injury inflammation , result acute post-operative pain . Acute pain surgery typically subside tissue healing ; however , patient go develop persistent post-surgical pain ( PPSP ) . It estimate 21-52 % people underwent thoracotomy , 21.5-47.3 % woman breast surgery , 4.7 % -18 % people underwent abdominal surgery develop PPSP . The incidence condition varies substantially type surgical procedure , also important factor affect mechanism PPSP . For example , thoracic surgery result predominantly neuropathic pain due intraoperative nerve injury , hysterectomy knee replacement surgery mechanisms PPSP seem predominantly inflammatory . However , data currently available prevalence potential mechanism PPSP cystectomy . Understanding prevalence , risk factor , potential mechanism underlie PPSP cystectomy serve basis investigating approach risk stratification prevention PPSP bladder cancer patient undergoing procedure .</detailed_description>
