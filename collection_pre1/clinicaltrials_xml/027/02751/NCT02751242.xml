	<brief_summary>The study team hypothesize patient risk diuretic resistance identify early Emergency Department ( ED ) hospital stay evaluate urine sodium potassium concentration initial dose IV loop diuretic . The goal pilot study prospectively study urinary electrolyte excretion determine pattern diuretic responsiveness . This study would utilize power interventional study aim study alternative method treat patient identify poor response diuretic ED hospital . This would expect significant impact patient 's hospital course , length stay adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Diuretic Resistance Patients With Acute Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient hospitalize acute heart failure ( AHF ) respond intravenous ( IV ) loop diuretic therapy , result symptom improvement discharge hospital 3-5 day stay . However , 20 % patient respond IV loop diuretic , find `` diuretic resistant '' . The treatment pathway cohort patient unclear . As result , experience significantly longer hospital length stay , consume healthcare resource , experience increase proportion adverse event . Clinicians currently reliable method predict become diuretic resistant . The diagnosis make hospitalization , base poor response diuretic result escalation therapy . The standard approach AHF therapy treat patient IV loop diuretic , know become diuretic resistant . When diuretic effective promote diuresis natriuresis urinary sodium rise urinary potassium fall . Those patient continue low urinary sodium despite IV diuretic administration risk develop diuretic resistance . Defining diuretic resistance base urinary electrolyte become clinically apparent would facilitate early change therapy , aim prevent prolonged hospitalization . Recently , method determine diuretic responsiveness base measurement urinary sodium first 6 hour diuretic administration report . This novel concept , suggest HF provider could identify poor diuretic responsiveness within 1-2 hour diuretic administration . This study conduct inpatient setting , subject enrol 4 day admission . Conducting similar ED-based study time initial diuretic administration would important determine early diuretic responsiveness also predict use formula urinary sodium output . The fractional sodium excretion , ( FeNa % ) , represent amount sodium excretion ( mmol/time ) percentage filter load [ plasma sodium concentration glomerular filtration rate ] . FeNa use several study assess diuresis HF patient . Baseline FeNa show reduce less 1 % patient HF baseline FeNa le 0.2 % associate diuretic resistance . Identifying effective therapy mitigate diuretic resistance improve symptom , decrease hospital length stay , conserve healthcare resource possibly improve morbidity mortality . Sodium reabsorption finely tune distal portion nephron sodium-chloride cotransporter ( NCC ) distal convolute tubule epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) collect duct . Although 5-10 % filter urinary sodium typically reach portion nephron , represent roughly 15-times average daily dietary sodium intake . Nearly 100 % sodium reabsorb set sodium depletion , hypovolemia , certain pathogenic condition ( congestive heart failure , decompensated cirrhosis ) . The aldosterone-sensitive collecting duct largely responsible fine regulation ability maximally active ENaC-dependent sodium reabsorption . Although ENaC activity expression measure vitro ( patch clamp ) animal study ( micropuncture , Western blot ) , assessment clinical study limit due inability access adequate tissue . Therefore , investigator use urinary sodium/potassium ratio index ENaC activity . The study team recently develop mass spectrometric assay urinary exosomal epithelial sodium channel ( Î³ENaC ) , demonstrate 15-fold increase low sodium diet aldosterone administration . This method represent significant technical advance provide clinical investigator tool measure ENaC expression future clinical study . The study team anticipate similar approach enable clinician measure expression additional relevant transporter channel .</detailed_description>
