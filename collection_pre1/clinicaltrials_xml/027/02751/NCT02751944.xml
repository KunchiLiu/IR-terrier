	<brief_title>NEM® Brand Eggshell Membrane Versus Placebo Exercise-induced Joint Pain , Stiffness , &amp; Cartilage Turnover</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Moderate exercise induce discomfort joint do infrequently do intensely long period . This discomfort often realize either pain stiffness joint focus exercise . For example , one 's knee hurt jog several mile , particularly jog first time . This study intend evaluate whether NEM® brand eggshell membrane alleviate joint pain stiffness , either directly follow exercise 12 hour post-exercise versus placebo . The study also evaluate NEM 's effect , , cartilage turnover via cartilage degradation biomarker c-terminal cross-linked telopeptide type II collagen ( CTX-II ) . Participants perform minimum 50 step per leg utilize aerobics step clinical site . They follow exercise regimen alternate day 2 week . Changes pain &amp; stiffness ( immediate &amp; 12-hour ) compare baseline placebo group . Blood &amp; Urine sample also collect baseline end Week 1 &amp; Week 2 . The change CTX-II compare baseline .</detailed_description>
