	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( CCE ) Versus Computed Tomographic Colonography ( CTC ) Identification Colonic Polyps Screening Population .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , randomize study evaluate efficacy CCE versus CTC identification colonic polyp screen population . Subjects enrol 20 clinical site United States . Subjects meet eligibility criterion screen gastroenterology site study participation baseline visit also include blood test renal function ( eGFR ) , evaluate randomized procedure day ( CCE versus CTC ) day blind unblinded OC procedure . Telephone follow-ups conduct 5 - 9 day CCE/CTC procedure 5 - 9 day unblinded OC procedure ass subject well-being capture AEs , regardless relationship CCE , CTC , OC procedure . All CCE RAPID® video CTC image evaluate local central reader . All study analysis base central reader result CCE CTC . Two set central reader utilize , one set reading CCE RAPID® video one set reading CTC study . Both group reader expert read process respective procedure . Readers provide report finding sponsor within 2 week capsule ingestion CTC procedure order allow subject return within 5 week capsule ingestion CTC procedure undergo confirmatory OC . The first OC procedure perform clinician blind CCE CTC result . Immediately follow blinded procedure , clinician review CCE CTC result report provide sponsor central reader , second unblinded OC procedure perform discrepancy CCE/CTC finding OC . Colonoscopy must perform person conduct local CCE reading , anyone review CCE/CTC result subject . Bowel preparation regimen three procedure type standardize across site .</detailed_description>
