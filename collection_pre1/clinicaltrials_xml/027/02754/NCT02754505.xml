	<brief_summary>Background : Few study show early rehabilitation Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) result well functional outcome hospital discharge reduce hospital stay . Effects early rehabilitation general ward directly transfer ICU length stay ( LOS ) hospital functional outcome miss . Methods : In prospective randomise control trial ( RCT ) 53 consecutive critical-illness-survivors enrol nine ICUs . Early rehabilitation program ( protocol ) consist exercise therapy , active breathing technique electrical stimulation discharge ICU ward-based care . The usual care group receive physical therapy order primary care team discharge ICU . LOS general ward transfer ICU record . Furthermore , Early-Rehabilitation-Barthel-Index ( ERBI ) , Visual-Analogue-Scale pain ( VAS ) , 3-Minute-walk-test ( 3min ) , Beck-Depression-Inventory ( BDI ) , State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory ( STAI ) , Medical-Research-Council-scale ( MRCS ) assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Patients All procedure describe study approved local Ethics Committee ( No . 375/2007 ) , informed consent obtain patient proxy . The study conduct prospectively 2008 2011 nine ICUs ( three medical , six surgical ; together 72 bed ) locate General Hospital Vienna/Medical University Vienna accord Helsinki Declaration 1975 , revise 1983 . Procedures ICU patient recruit soon suitable early ICU rehabilitation ( see inclusion criterion ) . After baseline measurement patient randomly assign early rehabilitation group . A computer-generated , permuted block randomization scheme use consider sex , age , LOS ICU diagnostic category allocate patient early rehabilitation group usual care group . Each assignment operate web-based randomization system ( http : //www.meduniwien.ac.at/randomizer ) investigator involvement . All include patient receive usual care physical therapy , order primary care team , stay ICUs . Unresponsive patient underwent passive range motion exercise limb . Once patient interaction achieve , matter patient mechanically ventilate , progressive early rehabilitation program initiate start active assist active range motion exercise breathe technique . If exercise tolerate , treatment advance bed mobility exercise , transfer upright sit sit balance activity . The early rehabilitation program progress participation activity daily live , sit-to-stand transferring , pre-gait exercise finally walk . Progression activity dependent patient tolerance stability ( systolic blood pressure 65 200 mm HG , heart rate 40 130 beat per minute , respiratory rate 5 40 breath per minute , pulse oximetry 88 % ) . Patients discharge general ward soon medical condition sufficiently stable , regardless functional status . Directly transfer general ward early rehabilitation group start early rehabilitation program , order experienced physiatrist . The early rehabilitation program consist coordinated exercise therapy neuromuscular electrical stimulation , two hour five day week discharge acute hospital . Exercise therapy include strength training ( three days/week , one three set 12-15 repetition , 8-10 exercise involve major muscle group : thigh , calf , buttock , trunk , shoulder girdle ) , aerobic exercise ( large muscle activity five days/week , 10-30 min/session , 50-80 % maximal heart rate ) active breathing technique . Exercise equipment use : Resistance band , free weight , weight machine , shoulder pulley , stationary bedside cycle ergometer , wobble board . Progression activity dependent patient tolerance stability . For neuromuscular electrical stimulation apply Compex-P© device produce biphasic symmetric impulse frequency 50 Hz pulse width 0.35 m ( stimulus regime : 8 on/24 ) five days/week , 30 min/session involve anterior thigh buttock . The usual care group receive single physical therapy session order primary care team transfer ICU general ward ( exercise therapy , neuromuscular electrical stimulation ) . Patients assess two medical student unaware randomization assignment . The medical student train experienced senior physician perform functional measure questionnaire . To maintain blinding , patient visitor instruct discuss previous intervention assessor primary care team . Furthermore , assessment occur 4 pm time distant therapy intervention . Statistics On basis ten pilot critical-illness-survivors admit intensive care , note mean difference seven day transfer general ward early rehabilitation protocol usual care reveal effect size 0.58 ( G*power 3.1.3 ) [ 39 ] . We calculate total sample size 40 critical-illness-survivors per group ( total 80 ) would need reach power 80 % use one side Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test significance level 0.05 . However inclusion time period new patient limit two half year 53 patient meet inclusion criterion willing participate . The primary endpoint , day hospital transfer ICU general ward , analyze intention treat per protocol analysis . The intention treat sample include patient , could transfer general ward General Hospital Vienna ( early rehabilitation group : n = 23 , usual care group : n = 27 ) , whereby patient randomize ICU transfer . Three patient already randomize exclude either unpredictable directly transfer another hospital ICU ( early rehabilitation group : n = 1 , usual care group : n = 1 ) , die ( usual care group : n = 1 ) ICU . The per protocol sample include patient randomize ICU , transfer general ward General Hospital Vienna , treatment really start ( early rehabilitation group : n = 19 , usual care group : n = 27 ) . For per protocol analysis , addition intention treat sample , four patient exclude early rehabilitation group receive additional treatment . The difference treatment usual care group analyze univariately log rank test , Kaplan-Meier curve plot . A Cox proportional hazard model apply analyze difference group , also account age , sex , diagnostic category admission , day ICU . We take time general ward patient treat General Hospital Vienna discharge , total time general ward ( day General Hospital Vienna + hospital ) patient treat General Hospital Vienna transfer another hospital . For patient , event ( discharge general ward ) occur within observation period , either lose follow ( mean transfer another hospital unknown LOS ) die . For patient take time general ward General Hospital Vienna transfer death , respectively , censor . In statistical analysis , censor consider patient experience event ( discharge general ward ) time censor . No assumption make may happen afterwards . The intention treat sample include five censor patient ( 3 early rehabilitation group , 2 usual care group ) per protocol sample three censored patient ( 1 early rehabilitation group , 2 usual care group ) . For analysis secondary endpoint ERBI , VAS , 3min , BDI , STAI , MRCS , descriptive statistic ( median , first quartile , third quartile , range ) carry baseline discharge hospital well difference discharge baseline treatment group separately include data patient randomize study . To compare hospital cost transfer ICU general ward early rehabilitation usual care group , descriptive statistic assess intention treat sample well per protocol sample . All analysis calculate statistic program SAS 9.2 R 3.0.1 . For primary analysis , p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
