	<brief_summary>Post-traumatic brain hypoxia/ischemia develop hour traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , intensity directly related neurological outcome . The threshold irreversible tissue damage follow TBI indicate particular vulnerability injure brain . Improving brain oxygenation severe TBI focus modern TBI management intensive care unit ( ICU ) . The calculation cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) , CPP = mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) - intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , become used estimator cerebral blow flow . To prevent ischemia due elevate ICP , current international guideline recommend maintain CPP 60-70 mmHg ICP 20 mmHg . However , episode brain hypoxia/ischemia , assess brain tissue oxygen pressure ( PbtO2 ) measurement , might occur despite optimization CPP ICP , independently associate poorer patient outcome . PbtO2 value low 15 mmHg 30 minute show independent predictor unfavorable outcome death . The aggressive treatment low PbtO2 associate improved outcome compare standard ICP/CPP-directed therapy cohort study severely head-injured patient . On basis finding , hypothesize early optimization brain oxygenation , together keep ICP CPP within recommended value , could reduce volume vulnerable lesion follow severe TBI possibly improve neurological outcome .</brief_summary>
