	<detailed_description>The study introduce highly accessible compel educational film design introduce , motivate , sustain patient exercise wellness amongst old hemodialysis patient , exercise counsel support nephrology staff family caregiver . Fit Dialysis film drama base focus group research old hemodialysis patient , family caregiver , health care practitioner highlight patient ' desire exercise well discouragement patient overprotective family , nurse ' preference patient sedentariness hemodialysis . Fit Dialysis tailor exigency out-patient hemodialysis setting acknowledge provide roadmap overcome disciplinary silo paternalism towards patient inhibit exercise hemodialysis , highlight life circumstance may influence patient ' self-management exercise behaviours home community . In order advance understanding way Fit Dialysis influence participant outcome , prospective 2-site parallel intervention trial implement compare film + 16-week exercise program one hospital , 16-week exercise-only program another hospital . Each hospital 12-week follow-up . Qualitative quantitative method use include semi-structured interview , physical fitness activity measure . These data use explore impact Fit Dialysis : knowledge/attitudes patient , family caregiver , staff regard exercise-based principle wellness ; education , motivation , maintenance patient exercise dialysis , home , community ; adherence exercise prescription ; patient physical fitness activity outcomes . The study also explore factor relate family caregiver , nephrologists , nurse , hospital administrator , patient ' home community environment may impact successful uptake key message Fit Dialysis . In intervention site ( film+exercise hospital ) , 30 patient view Fit Dialysis participate exercise program ; exercise-only hospital , 30 patient exercise . A family caregiver participate patient either view Fit Dialysis read information letter benefit contraindication exercise ( film+exercise hospital ) , read information letter ( exercise-only hospital ) . In film+exercise hospital , five nephrologists , 10 nurse 3 administrator also view film .
