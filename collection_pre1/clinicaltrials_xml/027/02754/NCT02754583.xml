	<brief_summary>SWIFT series 3 cluster-randomized trial design ass several alternative strategy trachoma control community treat many year mass azithromycin distribution . The first trial ( name WUHA ) compare community receive comprehensive Water , Sanitation , Hygiene ( WASH ) package receive intervention . The second trial ( name TAITU-A ) compare community randomize targeted antibiotic treatment versus randomize mass antibiotic trachoma , third trial ( TAITU-B ) compare community randomize targeted antibiotic versus randomize delayed antibiotic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trachoma blind disease cause ocular strain Chlamydia trachomatis . The Carter Center Proctor Foundation jointly conduct trachoma research Amhara region Ethiopia past 10 year , series clinical trial . We find repeat mass administration oral azithromycin greatly reduce prevalence trachoma , mass antibiotic unable thus far eliminate infection . The World Health Organization recommend antibiotic control trachoma , entire SAFE strategy ( Surgery in-turned eyelid , Antibiotics , Facial hygiene promotion , Environmental improvement latrine water point ) . The rationale SAFE strategy base many year observational study trachoma . Cross-sectional study find clinically active trachoma ocular chlamydial infection associate several indicator poor hygiene , include dirty face , face-seeking fly , long distance water supply , lack household latrine . There randomized trial test impact WASH improvement trachoma . In past , WHO recommend target antibiotic treatment individual active disease , could alternative treatment strategy would limit antibiotic use community perhaps cost-saving . However , little research assess targeted treatment strategy trachoma elimination follow repeated mass azithromycin distribution . Our long term goal eliminate trachoma even hyperendemic community . This cluster-randomized clinical trial determine role comprehensive package sanitation measure elimination trachoma . We monitor clinical disease photography , monitor infection newer chlamydial polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test ( Abbott m2000 ) sensitive early generation test , provide quantification . We monitor potential health benefit WASH intervention test overall cost effectiveness . We also assess compete strategy minimize antibiotic use : target azithromycin treatment child test positive ocular chlamydia . We model long-term cost-effectiveness compete strategy trachoma control completion several round mass azithromycin distribution . As ancillary trial , examine whether albendazole oral azithromiacin distribution alters intestinal microbiome . We also examine validity use rectal swabs versus bulk stool sample measure soil transmit helminth ( STHs ) . For ancillary trial , randomization unit person community .</detailed_description>
