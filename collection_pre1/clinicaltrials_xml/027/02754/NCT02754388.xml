	<detailed_description>Lung cancer one leading cause cancer-related death Taiwan . Early diagnosis lung cancer may improve cancer survival . Low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT ) think best screen tool lung cancer . However , grow concern radiation exposure , high cost , high rate false-positive screening result . Epidemiologic study western country show cigarette smoking major cause lung cancer , risk factor may include age , environmental pollution , occupational exposure ( included radon exposure ) , gender , race , pre-existing lung disease . Adenocarcinoma major type lung cancer Taiwan less attributable smoking . The investigator need different risk prediction model adapt investigator country . National Taiwan University Hospital Chu-Tung Branch initiate lung cancer screen LDCT since June 2015 . Many people get LDCT screen affordable price subsidy enterprise donation . The purpose study observe participant 2-year follow-up . Furthermore , data may connect another study `` Low dose compute tomography screening study nonsmoker risk factor lung cancer Taiwan '' （Non-smoker study）which implement hospital Taiwan . Aim 1 : Being control group non-smoker study , investigator collect relevant information participant validate modify risk assessment model . Applying questionnaire non-smoker study result LDCT screen different population . All data could provide extra information improve risk prediction model predict lung cancer non-smokers Taiwan . Aim 2 : To establish local epidemiological data lung pathology . From baseline data , screen result LDCT , telephone follow questionable lesion , collection patient 's medical record , linkage National Health Insurance Database , investigator able establish local epidemiology data lung pathology well information screen accuracy LDCT . Aim 3 : To examine psychosocial impact health behavior participant receive LDCT . Questionnaire survey provide understand anxiety life quality several time point since LDCT screen . The study investigate whether screen result associated health behavior change , smoking , drinking , exercise . Keywords : Lung cancer , Low dose compute tomography , screen , health behavior , psychological factor .</detailed_description>
