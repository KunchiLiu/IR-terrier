	<detailed_description>Background : Acute pericarditis relatively common disorder report incidence range 3.32 27.7 case per 100,000 person per year Western word.Potential complication acute pericarditis include pericarditis recurrence , cardiac tamponade constrictive pericarditis.To date limit clinical evidence prognostic factor outcome acute pericarditis ; use steroids/colchicine , kinetics C-reactive protein ( CRP ) acute phase underlie aetiology previously associate recurrence acute pericarditis . Nevertheless currently establish biomarkers risk stratify patient acute pericarditis . Methods : This prospective observational study three hundred ( n=300 ) patient first diagnosis acute pericarditis explore value plasma image biomarkers predict clinical outcome . Written inform consent obtain obtained patient . The protocol approve Institutional Ethics Committee ( ref . number 14167/20/08/2009 ) carry accordance principle declaration Helsinki . Diagnosis acute pericarditis choice treatment Acute pericarditis diagnose base clinical recommendation . Baseline clinical demographic data record case . In line current guideline , diagnostic work-up include clinical history examination , ECG , chest x-ray , echocardiography routine blood test include among others high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I CRP.12 In patient high risk feature secondary form complicate course13 additional test perform discretion attend physician . Ibuprofen 600mg tid aspirin 1gr tid give first line therapy least 7-10 day provide CRP normalize within time interval , subsequent taper follow 3-4 week . Steroids give dose 0.2-0.5mg/kg prednisolone equivalent dose another steroid CRP normalization symptom resolution follow taper accord recommendation . Indications steroid administration first line treatment include secondary cause pericarditis contraindication poor response NSAIDs treatment ( persist symptom and/or CRP elevation beyond 10 day treatment ) . Colchicine give case dose 0.5mg bid ( unless contraindicate ) halve patient age &gt; 70 year old body weight &lt; 70kg.Treatment failure first line medication and/or switch steroid reason record . Clinical follow-up All patient include followed-up outpatient ' clinic 2 week , 1 month , 2 month post-hospital discharge every 3 month thereafter ( earlier symptomatic ) total 18 month , give majority clinical complication appear within time frame.The composite clinical end-point poor response NSAIDs treatment ( define need switch 2nd line therapy ) development either recurrent , incessant constrictive pericarditis . Pericarditis diagnose incessant lasting 4-6 week less 3 month recurrent presence 4-6 week symptom-free interval 4-6 week 2 consecutive episode . Measurement plasma biomarkers The prognostic value plasma biomarkers CRP , troponin I , proinflammatory cytokine ( e.g . IL-6 , IL18 others ) patient acute pericarditis investigate . The value micro-RNAs ( miRNAs ) candidate biomarkers involve pathogenesis acute pericarditis also seek gene expression study . Measurement Imaging biomarkers Stored image datasets ( e.g.cardiac ultrasound image , cardiac compute tomography data etc ) use explore value image biomarkers ( e.g epicardial fat volume compute tomography , speckle-tracking analysis cardiac ultrasound ) predict clinical outcome patient acute pericarditis .</detailed_description>
