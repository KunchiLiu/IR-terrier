The investigator 4 aim study : Aim 1 : Undertake multiple-phase escalate gluten challenge assess safety gluten exposure hookworm-naïve hookworm-infected people CeD . Aim 2 : This phase Ib study recognize evidence support novel intervention rudimentary address amongst others follow question : ( ) The importance L3 dose Participant health , ( b ) importance L3 dose safety escalate gluten challenge ( c ) need comparator group phase II trial warrant . Aim 3 : Examine change intestinal T cell response induce hookworm infection gluten exposure . Aim 4 : Assess impact hookworm infection purify hookworm-derived protein gluten peptide-specific immune response ex vivo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial Phase 1b multicentre , multinational , randomize , double-blind single-blind arm open label extension phase , placebo control , clinical trial evaluate safety predictability escalate gluten consumption activate Coeliac Disease ( CeD ) ( ) small cohort people diet-managed CeD treat placebo ( n=10 ) , ( b ) cohorts follow low ( L3-10 ; n=40 ) medium ( L3-20 ; n=10 ) dose hookworm inoculum . Aim 1 &amp; 2/Clinical study : The primary outcome safety escalate 30-week gluten challenge hookworm naïve hookworm infect people CeD follow low medium-dose hookworm infection , assess change duodenal villous height crypt depth ratio ( V : C ) pre-trial ( week -2 ) post-challenge ( week 42 ) . This binary variable define safe gluten challenge complete V : C ratio &gt; 2.0 &lt; 20 % change value baseline fail drop occur prior completion gluten challenge V : C ratio &lt; 2.0 change baseline &gt; 20 % . Secondary outcome include safety low medium intensity hookworm infection intermediate ( 36 week ) later endpoint ( 42 week ) escalate gluten challenge , assess incidence adverse event , serious adverse event well general health . Secondary outcome measure include change V : C ratio baseline intermediate later endpoint , progression successful gluten challenge phase trial include liberal diet , mucosal intraepithelial lymphocyte count , Celiac Symptom Index ( CSI questionnaire ) , Celiac-Quality Life Score ( QOL questionnaire ) serum immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) tissue transglutaminase ( tTG ) level cohort . Aims 3 &amp; 4/Associated vitro cell measure ex vivo mucosal stimulation investigation : The associated study design fully explore immunological process underpin clinical outcome , take advantage mucosal tissue collect excess clinical requirement test individual component hookworm secretion believe hold great potential future therapy . These experiment complex often depend quality tissue cell collect . Study Procedure : After write informed consent obtain screen visit prior enrolment Participants may require haematological work confirm eligibility . Participants randomize receive hookworm larva ( L3-10 L3-20 ) suspend 2-3 drop water apply skin cover light dressing , Tabasco® Sauce solution ( Placebo Comparator ) . Before inoculation , Participant complete QOL questionnaire , submit fresh faecal specimen , undergo blood draw duodenal biopsy . Thereafter week duration participation , food diary CSI questionnaire submit . At designated time , gluten introduce escalate volume . Blood , faecal biopsy collection , QOL questionnaire also collect . To well evaluate independent effect L3 host immunity , L3-20 cohort undergo endoscopy week 12 lieu week 36 intervention . Safety Parameters/Analysis : General health assessment , physical examination vital sign obtain screen thereafter designate clinic visit ( symptom driven require ) . Incidence severity Adverse Serious Events include evidence gluten intolerance hookworm relate complication Participants evaluate formally structure questionnaire ( CSI weekly QOL designate time ) scrutinise designate research nurse informally Participant initiate personal contact research nurse clinician . As well , blood clinical safety histological result scrutinise contemporaneously ( designate research nurse designate researcher ) incidence severity laboratory abnormality . Blood result symptom score cod re-identifiable format add access-restricted secure database . Screening blood test include serum pregnancy test screening ( positive test exclude Participant enter trial ) urine pregnancy test pregnancy suspect throughout trial . The 12-month progression liberal diet monitor tTG evaluate monthly , monthly CSI evaluation Participant contact . Laboratory Parameters/Analysis : Blood analysis : Complete blood count ( CBC ) , IgA-tTG titre , liver renal function iron test screen serum pregnancy test perform Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology ( SNP ) Australia Canterbury Health Laboratories New Zealand . From residual blood , peripheral blood mononuclear cell harvest ( circumstance permit ) serum store . Faecal analysis : Samples collect anaerobic collection bag aliquot transfer provided screw top plastic jar , frozen -20°C short term storage transport , store -80°C long-term parasite egg quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) analysis perform nominated un-blinded personnel supervise Prof. James McCarthy QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute , result remain blinded trial personnel . Faecal sample also store future analysis bacterial community ( microbiota ) . Mucosal analysis : Duodenal biopsy ( 14 pinch biopsy , consistent previous trial ) take nationally trial accredit gastroenterologist support sedationist accredit facility . Four biopsy commit conventional histology . To ensure standardisation Biopsy forceps use Boston Scientific Radial Jaw® 4 - 2.8mm . Paraffin embed tissue section ( 3 μm ) stain H &amp; E anti-cluster differentiation 3 ( anti-CD3 ) . Clinical histopathology supervise specialist gastrointestinal pathology ( A/Prof . Andrew Clouston ) report contemporaneously clinical purpose . Best representative field image case select Prof. Clouston , cod re-identifiable format add access-restricted secure database , later score intraepithelial lymphocyte ( IEL ) % V : C single pathologist ( Dr. Greg Miller ) . At time point , two four biopsy tissue sample store -80°C 10 % glycerolRNA stabilisation solution future gene expression microbiota analysis . Total Blood volume : 50 ml per collection x 6 week minus 4 week 42 . 10 ml per month 12 month . Total 420 ml 2 year . Sample size determination : Gluten consumption toxic consume people CeD . Unlike conventional trial test intervention reverse disease , trial relies gluten toxicity promote disease activity . The trial primarily evaluate safety gluten exposure CeD hookworm-infected Participants . The escalate gluten challenge propose unprecedented , whilst liberal gluten consumption consume many people CeD either though ignorance diagnosis conscious decision comply medical advice , anticipated challenge adversely affect unprotected placebo control . Consistent concern , control cohort keep small . The study consist 60 participant , 10 control group , 40 low-dose hookworm group ( L3-10 ) 10 medium-dose hookworm group ( L3-20 ) .</detailed_description>
