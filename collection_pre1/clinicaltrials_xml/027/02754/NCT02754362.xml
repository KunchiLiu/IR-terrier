	<brief_title>A Toll-like Receptor Agonist Adjuvant Tumor Associated Antigens ( TAA ) Mixed With Montanide ISA-51 VG With Bevacizumab Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient receive dose vaccine , Poly-ICLC bevacizumab . The therapy consist 3 block . During first block , patient receive bevacizumab every 2 week 2 dos . During block 2 , patient receive vaccine + Poly-ICLC + bevacizumab week 1 , 3 , 5 7 . An MRI perform week 7 therapy . If significant progression , patient continue block 3 . During block 3 , therapy consist vaccine + Poly-ICLC monthly bevacizumab every 2 week 10 month . Keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) give positive control first vaccine . Immune study perform patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
