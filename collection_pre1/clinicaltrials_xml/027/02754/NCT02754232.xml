	<brief_title>Telemedical Training Chronically Ill COPD Patients : Cross Sectoral Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Description : Problem : Training important part treatment rehabilitation patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) train increase patient ' muscle mass , lead high physical performance , reduce difficulty breathe hereby improve patient 's ability make use medical treatment . Rehabilitation provide hospital train centres/outpatient clinic . However , transport tire patient , decline take part . This mean worsen condition increase readmission . Solution : - To develop well treatment patient severe COPD : Telemedical training patient COPD team . - To develop cross-sectoral practice telemedical training patient use , thus decrease readmission OUH 's patient severe COPD - To optimize patient ' journey across sector border use Lean method . The project relevance clinic target group : The study expect contribute improve treatment severely ill patient COPD cross-sectorally generate knowledge physical occupational therapist ' practice . The result expect contribute reduce readmission raise level evidence telemedical research training patient severe COPD . The study include patient severe COPD Odense Svendborg . It anticipate similar patient group similar difficulty , nationally well internationally , benefit finding . Background : More 430.000 people Denmark Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) ( Hansen et al. , 2008 ) . Characteristic COPD respiratory tract obstruction , completely reversible worsens time pass . Complications COPD : loss muscle mass , weight loss increase social isolation ( The National Board Health , 2007 ) . It well document systematic individually composed rehabilitation program , include training , effect patient ' functional level quality life ( National board Health , 2007 ) . Early rehabilitation hospitalization may break vicious circle , arise patient COPD . In cycle , hospitalization entail inactivity loss muscular strength , thus increase risk new aggravation re-admittance hospital result ( National board Health , 2014 ) . In addition , time study examine effect train daily activity ( ibid ) . To offer severely ill patient rehabilitation regional task . However , patient severe COPD often decline training , transport hospital exhaust . The result training group . The dilemma exist country ( Burkow et al. , 2013 ) . Inactivity mean stagnation daily life , affect function ( Williams et al. , 2011 ) patient family ( Wong et al. , 2005 ) Patients COPD , take part usual rehabilitation program due degree illness , recommend take part strength training replacement . The recommendation base solely consensus good clinical practice . Research lack ( National Board Health , 2014 ) . Few study examine telemedicine , COPD supervise training . Two study supervise team training , among others , patient COPD show great patient satisfaction increase experience social support ( Nield Hoo , 2012 , Burkow et al. , 2013 ) . One study show significantly decrease occurrence dyspnoea intervention group ( Nield Hoo , 2012 ) . In 2010-2012 OUH feasibility study attempt develop train program patient severe severe COPD reject establish rehabilitation program hospital . The study , encompass 50 patient year , test develop early effort use individually tailor home-training program base telemedical training . The result show potential relation previous telemedical training patient COPD . Considering scanty knowledge field , contribution produce knowledge great variation relevant . Project type : An randomise control Study ( RCT ) need reveal effect telemedical training muscle strength related every day chores see affect daily activity quality life . The RCT study : Aim : The aim study effect telemedical training activity daily live , quality life physical performance patient severe severe COPD . Hypotheses : This study design assess hypothesis patient severe severe COPD , thank training hospital , receive telemedical training experience great satisfaction daily activity , increase quality life increase physical performance patient receive telemedical training . Place project participant : Patients take part study admit OUH worsen COPD . The criterion inclusion exclusion criterion submit elsewhere . Design method : The project participant include consecutively intervention group control group two year . A power calculation show study , random sample size 100 patient , 50 group , show difference 2,7 second FTSST ( Stand - sit five time ) . The strength set 80 % . The calculation base standard deviation 4,8 FTSST 5 % to-sided significance level . If dropout rate 20 % allow , mean 128 person must include . The patient randomize intervention group control group baseline inform consent . Measurements make baseline , post-intervention follow-up , 3 6 month post-intervention . Patients intervention group receive telemedical training team 4 , 21 time , three time weekly seven week . During first three week regional physiotherapist responsible training . Municipal occupational -and physiotherapist manage last four week ' training . Patients control-group receive training refuse offer . They discharge municipal sphere rehabilitation plan . Data generation method : Function test questionnaire include quantitative study telemedicial training 's importance physical ability , daily activity health relate quality life patient severe severe COPD . Outcome measure submit elsewhere . The following parameter describe participate patient group : Sex , age , civil status , socio - economic status , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , forced expiratory volume one 1 second ( FEV1 ) expect value , FEV1 / force vital capacity ( FVC ) , Medical Research Council Breathlessness Scale ( MRC- dyspnea score ) , oxygen treatment home , treatment atomizer , usual inhale COPD treatment ( group ) , oral prednisolone treatment , home care , use tobacco . Whether telemedical training effect readmission patient COPD examine compare number admission intervention group control group . Data requisition Region 's IT . Analysis : The data continuously key Access database . Calculation analysis do use software program STATA ( abbreviation Statistic Data ) . The data analyze accord principle ‛intention treat ' . The level significance α place 0,05 power β = 0,8 . Descriptive statistic regression analysis use . Ethical consideration : The patient inform project 's goal , form content orally write form participation voluntary . Written consent must inclusion . Participants inform leave study time . The project leader file inclusion number correspond personal data securely accord applicable rule . The project register approve The Danish Data Protection Agency Danish Council Ethics . Documentation result , knowledge share distribution : Three article publish relevant international peer-reviewed journal . The Danish Lung Association continuously inform study 's status . The result distribute national international conference , study abroad . These include health professional forum Ph.D. study - depend result study . Database : Data project store via Odense Patient Explorative Network ( OPEN ) - specifically Redcap data management system . Redcap approve God Clinical practice ( GCP ) .</detailed_description>
