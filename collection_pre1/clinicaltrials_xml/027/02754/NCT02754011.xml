Progressive patient eligible treatment capecitabine : failure taxanes ( neoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic setting ) failure prior anthracyclinebased chemotherapy ( unless contraindicate ) 4 . Tumor overexpressing HER2 ( HER2 1+ IHC , IHC 2+ FISH/ CISH negative ) sample primary and/or secondary tumor 5 . A representative tumor specimen must available future research program . An archival tumor sample may submit ; however , one available , newly obtain tumor biopsy specimen must submit instead 6 . Measurable evaluable disease accord RECIST v1.1 criterion 7 .

Patient known hypersensitivity 5FU excipients ribociclib capecitabine 4 . Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement unless meet ALL follow criterion : At least 4 week prior therapy completion ( include radiation and/or surgery ) start study treatment Clinically stable CNS tumor time screen receive steroid and/or enzymeinducing antiepileptic medication brain metastases 5 . Patient impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) 6 . Patient known history HIV infection ( test mandatory ) 7 . Clinically significant , uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent event include follow : History acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery bypass grafting , coronary angioplasty , stenting ) symptomatic pericarditis within 12 month prior screen History document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) Documented cardiomyopathy Patient Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % determined Multiple Gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) screen History cardiac arrhythmia , e.g. , ventricular , supraventricular , nodal arrhythmia , conduction abnormality within 12 month screen Congenital long QT syndrome family history long QT syndrome Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 160 mmHg &lt; 90 mmHg screen Bradycardia ( heart rate &lt; 50 rest ) , ECG pulse , screen 8 . On screening , inability determine QTcF interval ECG ( i.e . : unreadable interpretable ) QTcF &gt; 450 msec ( use Fridericia 's correction ) . All determine screen ECG ( mean triplicate ECGs ) 9 . Patient currently receive follow medication ( see Table 9 detail ) discontinue 7 day prior start study drug : Known strong inducer inhibitor CYP3A4/5 , include grapefruit , grapefruit hybrid , pummelo , starfruit , Seville oranges That narrow therapeutic window predominantly metabolize CYP3A4/5 That know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes Herbal preparations/medications , dietary supplement 10 . Patient currently receive receive : systemic corticosteroid within ≤ 2 week prior start study drug , fully recover side effect treatment . The following us corticosteroid permit : single dos , topical application ( e.g. , rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g. , obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g. , intraarticular ) sorivudine brivudine within 4 week prior start capecitabine 11 . Patients concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition would , investigator 's judgement , cause unacceptable safety risk , contraindicate participation study compromise compliance protocol ( e.g. , uncontrolled hypertension and/or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , clinically significant pulmonary disease , clinically significant neurological disorder , chronic pancreatitis , chronic active hepatitis , active untreated uncontrolled fungal , bacterial viral infection , etc . ) 12 . Patient currently receive warfarin coumarinderived anticoagulant treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) fondaparinux allow 13 .
