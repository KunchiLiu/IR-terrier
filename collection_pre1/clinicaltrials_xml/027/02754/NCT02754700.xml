	<detailed_description>Real-time Optimized Biofeedback Utilizing Sport Techniques ( ROBUST ) represent innovative new approach reduce traumatic anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injury . Over last four decade , debilitate injury occur 2 10-fold great rate female compare male athlete high prevalence occur age 16-18 year . As consequence , large population female endure significant pain , functional limitation knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) early 5 year initial unintentional injury . To reduce burden OA , The National Public Health Agenda Osteoarthritis recommend expand refine evidence-based prevention ACL injury . There currently gap knowledge regard maximize effectiveness injury prevention training young female athlete . The long-term goal reduce ACL injury young female athlete . The objective application increase efficacy biofeedback training reduce risk ACL injury . This proposal test central hypothesis biofeedback methodology need maximize effectiveness neuromuscular prophylactic intervention . The rationale support proposal propose research complete , health professional successful prevent devastate ACL injury properly optimize target biofeedback train young at-risk female . This research innovative represent new substantive departure status quo recognize need optimize application biofeedback training . The work contribute clinically relevant data support future robust clinical trial . The propose research significant lead reduce rate ACL injury young female . Reduction female injury rate equal male would allow female annually continue health benefit sport participation avoid long-term complication osteoarthritis , occur 10 100-fold great incidence ACL-injured uninjured athlete .</detailed_description>
