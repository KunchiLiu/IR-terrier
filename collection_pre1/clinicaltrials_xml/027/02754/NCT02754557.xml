	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy physiologically-augmented breath-focused mindfulness-based intervention reduce symptom dissociation associate psychological trauma , well symptom posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The study evaluate whether physiological augmentation produce great change dissociative symptom , meditative engagement attentional control , compare non-augmented mindfulness . The augmentation comprise physiological feedback form vibration wrist . Vibrations deliver device place participant 's arm ; device vibrates proportion person 's breath .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiological Augmentation Mindfulness Meditation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronically traumatize people much high risk develop dissociative symptom , notoriously difficult treat , particularly context posttraumatic stress disorder symptom . Dissociation phenomenon involve feeling separation one 's body emotional state . Mindfulness practice , include breath-focused mindfulness meditation , know useful improve attention one 's physiological state , thus enhance feel `` connection '' one 's present experience . However , mindfulness-based practice naturally challenge task highly dissociative people . The present project propose use novel device use physiological feedback boost effect breath-focused mindfulness meditation population . This device element place wrist vibrates accordance one 's breath . The method capitalize `` bottom-up '' neurophysiological process . We plan recruit 60 highly dissociative traumatize people establish highly productive NIH-funded project . Participants randomly assign 8 session either breath-focused mindfulness meditation physiologically augment breath-focused mindfulness meditation . Electroencephalography data collect intervention session , fMRI data collect pre- post-intervention . These method use ass whether physiological augmentation produce : increase coherence `` network-like '' activity among brain region involve interoception ( awareness one 's bodily state ) ; selective attention breath ( increase tempero-parietal EEG gamma ) meditative engagement ( increased frontal EEG theta ) . Clinical neuropsychological measure use assess potential effect dissociative posttraumatic symptom , well selective sustain attention mindfulness ability . A follow-up conducted 1 month post-treatment examine sustain clinical cognitive effect .</detailed_description>
