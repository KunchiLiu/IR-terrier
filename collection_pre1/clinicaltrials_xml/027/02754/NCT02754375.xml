	<brief_summary>Biological marker depressive state study , usefulness predict therapeutic response unknown . This issue major depressive state remit several line treatment . rTMS ( repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ) non-pharmacological alternative treatment depression , effect cerebral function know episode resist conventional treatment . The investigator include 50 depressive patient fail respond two successive antidepressant medication , propose treatment low frequency rTMS 3 6 week . Cerebral functional image 18FDG-PET ( positon emission tomography ) assess begin end rTMS acute treatment , order measure induce metabolic change correlation clinical state . Patients respond rTMS acute treatment may continue therapeutic six month , investigator assess efficacy maintenance relate cerebral metabolic variation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SMTr-METAB : FDG-PET Assessment Cerebral Metabolism Resistant Depression Treated With rTMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In France , lifetime prevalence depression 21 % , major consequence : handicap , loss productivity , reduction quality life , increased mortality . The efficient long-lasting care depression consequently priority public health . Despite well-conducted conventional therapeutic strategy , estimate 30 % depressed patient respond antidepressant , 30 % present partial response , 40 % patient complete remission . Non-pharmacological alternative treatment promote , particularly repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . A recent meta-analysis 29 randomize control trial versus placebo report 29.3 % response rate 18.6 % remission rate active stimulation v respectively , 10.4 % 5 % placebo stimulation . However , predictive biomarkers response unknown , cerebral metabolism may good candidate . It admit depressive state correlate specific modification glucose metabolism circuit involve neurobiology depression . The amplitude change may correlate clinical severity may differ treatment type , cerebral metabolic change might additional guide treatment . Finally , therapeutic effect might normalize cerebral functional activity might early correlate clinical response . However study use functional imaging therapeutic approach understand physiopathology depression usable clinical practice routine . The investigator suggest use well-known analysis software ( Scenium software , Siemens GmbH ) allow automate analysis distribution cerebral metabolism mean F18-FDG TEP-TDM quantitative measure , express regional consumption glucose express g / 100 g / min every 18F-FDG TEP-TDM every region interest . Image register camera , remote injection tracer , last less 10 minutes.The software also allow compare data acquire patient standardized database . The investigator perform open study two center ( Monaco Hospital/Nice CHU ) 50 depressed patient age 40 65 year old , answer 2 line well lead antidepressant . Low-frequency rTMS propose acute cure ( 3 6 week ) monotherapy follow 6 month rTMS patient respond acute treatment phase . Cerebral metabolic modification ( location intensity ) calculate two PET-TDM every patient , realize acute treatment rTMS . We shall use SCENIUM software allow compare patient 's data standardize database . At end acute period treatment , propose patient respond pursue rTMS treatment consolidation phase 6 month . All patient longitudinally assessed consolidation period . One objective assess initial TEP-TDM data and/or amplitude induce metabolic variation associate stability clinical answer respondent patient</detailed_description>
