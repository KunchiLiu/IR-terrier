	<brief_summary>Many patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) experience muscle weakness . This muscle weakness occur whilst patient unconscious , immobile bed breathe machine ( ventilator ) . It develop quickly , soon become unwell . The investigator know weakness make harder patient regain normal level functional ability , stand walk independently . Physical rehabilitation , deliver physiotherapist , important patient recover critical illness help regain strength practice ability perform physical activity . These activity include sit edge bed , stand , step spot walking . However difficult know hard patient recover critical illness perform type activity - word , much energy require . Some patient may find certain activity hard easy others . By know energy requirement patient whilst take part different physical rehabilitation activity , physiotherapist may able accurate prescribing exercise design rehabilitation session patient practice achieve activity . In study , investigator measure energy requirement patient take part physiotherapy-led physical rehabilitation admission . To , investigator use different ventilator one normally use help breathing . This ventilator work exactly way , extra component build measure energy requirement . After rehabilitation session , patient return use normal ventilator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Feasibility Measuring Energy Expenditure During Physical Rehabilitation In Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) critical illness typically associate profound physical impairment include peripheral skeletal muscle waste dysfunction . These effect demonstrate rapid onset point ICU admission , affect high illness acuity great level , contribute development intensive care unit-acquired weakness ( ICU-AW ) define severe upper low limb muscle weakness . Clinically patient present significant limitation exercise capacity performance physical functional activity , deficit persist many year follow resolution original illness . Physical rehabilitation recommend address physical functional deficit associate ICU-AW , delivery advocate across continuum patient recovery pathway , commence whilst ICU , follow transfer ward beyond hospital discharge . Physical rehabilitation within ICU typically incorporate early mobilisation ( EM ) , characterise hierarchical progression increasingly functional activity active-assisted bed exercise , sitting-on-the-edge-of-the-bed ( SOEOB ) , stand , marching-on-the-spot walking . These activity summarise ICU Mobility Scale . In recent year , adjunctive technology include electrical muscle stimulation , interactive video-games passive cycle ergometry also utilised . Delivery early mobilisation feasible , safe effective improve short long-term outcome critically ill patient even early stage recovery whilst patient remain ventilated receiving form organ support . However , optimum 'dose ' physical rehabilitation deliver patient whilst ICU remains undetermined . Early mobilisation reflect clinically pragmatic approach patient management , data support intensity , frequency timing intervention . Furthermore , little know acute physiological response undertake type exercise patient population . Metabolic monitor provide information energy expenditure patient . However , direct method data acquisition use pulmonary artery catheter measure whole-body oxygen consumption unreliable use clinical practice diminish recent year . The non-invasive technique indirect calorimetry ( IC ) therefore emerge potential alternative may practically applicable clinical setting . Indirect calorimetry measure total gas exchange , oxygen consumption carbon dioxide production turn determine energy expenditure . However widespread clinical utility IC technique , offset number clinical factor may preclude use across patient e.g . cardiovascular ventilator instability , open chest drainage receive renal haemofiltration . Two study date use IC examine response physical rehabilitation activity perform patient ICU . Collings et al conduct randomise cross-over study 10 ICU patient complete either passive chair transfer active sit-over-the-edge-of-the-bed ( SOEOB ) one day , follow alternative activity consecutive day . The 'active ' SOEOB activity elicit significantly great increase oxygen consumption passive activity ( 90.69 ml/min ( 95 % CI 44.04 137.34 ) v 14.43 ml/min ( 95 % CI −27.28 56.14 ) , p = 0.007 ) . Hickmann et al examine active passive cycling critically ill patient healthy control , demonstrate increase oxygen consumption active exercise compare passive patient differ energy requirement compare healthy individual . This limited exist evidence-base demonstrate potential use IC characterise physical rehabilitation critically ill patient , restrict particular type activity fail capture sequential assessment patient rehabilitation progress increasingly functional level . Acknowledging potential clinical limitation apply IC measurement technique critically ill patient , aim study examine feasibility measure energy expenditure critically ill patient complete range physical rehabilitation activity ( characterise ICU Mobility Scale ) perform sequentially ICU ventilator wean unit ( Lane Fox Respiratory Unit , LFU ) admission use indirect calorimetry .</detailed_description>
