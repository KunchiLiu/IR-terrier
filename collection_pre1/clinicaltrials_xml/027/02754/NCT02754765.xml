	<brief_title>Evaluating Newly Approved Drugs Multidrug-resistant TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , randomize , control , open-label , non-inferiority , multi-country trial evaluate efficacy safety new combination regimens MDR-TB treatment . Regimens examine combine newly approve drug bedaquiline and/or delamanid exist drug know active Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( linezolid , clofazimine , moxifloxacin levofloxacin , pyrazinamide ) . The study enroll parallel across 5 experimental 1 standard-of-care control arm . Randomization outcome adapt use Bayesian interim analysis efficacy endpoint . Experimental regimen contain bedaquiline and/or delamanid 4 companion drug . Control-arm treatment may contain one follow ( bedaquiline delamanid ) companion drug , construct deliver accord local standard care consistent WHO guideline . Trial participation arm 104 week post randomization . In experimental arm , treatment 39 week ( participant experimental arm allow 47 week complete 39-week treatment course ) post-treatment follow 65 additional week . In control arm , treatment deliver accord local standard care ( consistence WHO guidance ) ; duration variable , approximately 86 week . Non-inferiority establish experimental arm lower bound one-sided 97.5 % confidence interval around difference favorable outcome control experimental arm great equal -12 % .</detailed_description>
