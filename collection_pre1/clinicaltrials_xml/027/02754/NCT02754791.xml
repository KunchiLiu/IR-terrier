	<brief_summary>Bloodstream infection cause significant morbidity mortality prompt identification essential part modern medicine . False positive result blood culture primarily due contaminant . It estimate 50 % positive blood culture represent contamination . These false positive culture , microbiological laboratory level , require significant additional resource workup . Additionally , result unnecessary antibiotic treatment hospitalization day , cause needless harm patient . Various method implement order reduce blood culture contaminant , include modify solution use sterilize skin feedback contamination rate . However , show bacteria colonize human skin surface fact colonize deep surface well . The SteriPath device diverts initial 1-2 ml blood remove potential skin plug contaminant . Thus , principle object study determination rate contamination blood culture take prior initiate intervention versus rate contamination use three intervention : Monthly feedback via departmental report card , chlorhexidine plus alcohol wipe SteriPath device . Secondary objective include ease use wipe SteriPath device estimate sensitivity SteriPath device use true bacteremia . If various intervention show reduce contamination , researcher also attempt estimate financial effect reduction , compare intervention cost estimate saving relate reduced contamination .</brief_summary>
