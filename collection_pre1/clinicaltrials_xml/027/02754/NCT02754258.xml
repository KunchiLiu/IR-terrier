	<brief_summary>The Problem : Obesity one leading cause chronic disease death . The efficacy diet exercise sustain weight loss long term weak . While pharmacotherapy effective behavior intervention maintain weight loss effect often sufficient achieve optimal health benefit . Current drug treatment may sub-optimal directly target reward value food , drive eat , food liking , impulsivity eat energy dense snack food , influence quantity quality food intake impact adherence need maintain weight loss . The Solution : The limitation current anti-obesity agent potentially addressed Methylphenidate ( MPH ) . We show MPH reduces food intake , dietary fat intake , hunger food reward , increase rest energy expenditure obese non-obese adult ; however , control field trial conduct obese individual without ADHD . Objectives/Hypotheses : Primary : To test effect MPH energy intake obese men woman . Secondary : examine effect MPH energy expenditure , body weight , impulsivity , food reward , olfaction . The investigator predict compare placebo , MPH show reduce appetite , along reduce impulsivity , food reward , smell function . Deliverable : This study may first establish short-term efficacy safety use MPH weight loss , successful , data inform large trial potentially identify MPH novel therapeutic agent treat obesity relate chronic disease predispose population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Methylphenidate Energy Intake Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Objectives Hypotheses Primary : The primary objective study examine whether Methylphenidate ( MPH ) dose 0.50 mg/kg ( exceed 100 mg/day ) lead sustain reduction energy intake obese adolescent adult . Based investigator ' pilot data adult , predict daily administration MPH 60 consecutive day produce reduction food intake ( lab free-living ) compare placebo , extend previous finding longer period time obese adolescent . Prior begin intervention , MPH placebo treatment group receive lifestyle advice ( eat exercise guideline healthy living ) . The primary outcome measure rely validate measurement energy intake ( lab lunch buffet lab 3 day food menu ) . Secondary objectives/hypotheses : The effect MPH component energy expenditure investigate . Based investigator ' pilot data , predict Baseline 60 day , MPH increase total energy expenditure ( TEE ) compare placebo , mostly great rest energy expenditure ( REE ) thermic effect food ( TEF ) . It hypothesize 60-day intervention MPH group experience significantly attenuate reduction REE compare placebo . We predict MPH group lose body weight 2 month , whereas , predict change body weight placebo . The investigator also explore effect MPH macronutrient preference consumption , reward value energy dense snack food . Based previous finding , investigator predict MPH reduce consumption energy dense , high fat/sugar food little effect consumption food low calorie , fat sugar . In addition , predict reduction intake energy dense , high fat/sugar food mediate reduction reward value food impulsivity measure well validated computerized simulation . Also explored effect MPH olfaction predict compare placebo , individual take MPH reduce smell function . It also predict MPH group show reduce appetite sensation , reduce reward value food , reduce impulsivity snack food , reduce palatability rating food compare placebo 2 month . Trial Design The trial design consist randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled 2 parallel arm study . The two randomly assign treatment group consist administrate placebo short-acting MPH two-times daily 1 hour meal period 2 month ( 60 consecutive day ) . Prior randomize either placebo group experimental ( MPH ) group , subject first respond recruitment poster , newspaper advertisement . Once determined initial screening participant still meet inclusion criterion , invite come laboratory screen visit determine whether meet eligibility criterion , sign informed consent , take test dose MPH order nurse closely monitor potential side-effects prior start 2-times daily dose MPH placebo . Trial Procedures The propose study consist six visit laboratory total twenty-four hour , follow : initial clinical screening visit ( 4 hr ) , three repeat measure test day ( 6hrs ; two baseline one 60 day ) , mid-point visit ( 1hr ) , Lunch Box visit ( 10 minute obtain laboratory food ) . School-aged participant miss school participate ; necessary , test able performed course weekend . After initial laboratory visit inform consent ( i.e . clinical screen visit ) , participant randomize Baseline 1 visit one two treatment group either receive placebo MPH two time daily 2 month intervention period start Baseline 2 visit . In order track physical activity energy expenditure , participant instruct wear accelerometer 1 week lab screen visit Baseline 1 visit , MPH placebo 1 week mid-point visit Final repeat measure test day . Upon leave Baseline 1 test day ( i.e . drug placebo ) participant receive 3 day supply food exclusively eat return lab 4 day later Baseline 2 repeated measure test day ( i.e . drug placebo ) . Similarly , 4 day prior Final repeat measure test day , participant visit laboratory `` Lunch Box '' visit obtain three day ' supply food eat exclusively . Participants return laboratory complete study Final ( day 60 ) repeat measure test day 3 day eat `` Lunch Boxes '' . For 1 hour mid-point visit ( day 30 ) participant weigh report perceive side-effects MPH placebo . At mid-point visit participant bring pill container verify compliance receive final 30 day supply drug placebo . At time participant ask begin new medication start over-the-counter medication part study 's safety monitoring protocol . A side-effects check list also provide participant upon leave Baseline 2 test session ; participant inform note perceive side-effects nightly first 14 day study medication instruct notify study coordinator soon specific side-effects note Major . Consent Clinical Screening Initial Screening Visit ( 4 hour ) Before begin study , meet study coordinator participant occur order get consent order participant ingest test dose MPH supervision nurse . The study coordinator contact participant order arrange time approximately 4 hour meeting . The weight height ( thus BMI ) measure upon arrival . The participant respond questionnaire , e.g . Wender-Utah Rating Scale ( assess trait compatible ADHD ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( assess depressive symptom ) , `` Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire '' ( assess eat style ) Drug Abuse Screening Test ( ensure underlie drug problem ) . If participant female pregnant include study ; thus pregnancy test administer determine pregnant refer visit family physician exclude study . If eligible , participant ask read sign consent form . Eligible participant see nurse administer measure outline Case Report Form , e.g. , physical exam , medical history assessment , baseline vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , etc . The nurse administer test dose 0.5mg/kg MPH period three hour ingestion MPH nurse closely monitor potential side-effects drug measure heart rate , blood pressure , follow detailed side-effects check-list . If point participant rate side effect `` Prohibitive '' , he/she exclude study . The participant also exclude enter study demonstrate abnormal ECG systolic blood pressure exceed baseline read 20mmHg diastolic blood pressure exceed baseline read 10mmHg , BP &gt; 160/100 , rest pulse increase 20 beats/minute baseline . As part comprehensive safety assessment determine eligibility , ECG data file collect store via USB external hard drive send CHEO cardiology read cardiologist . Once determined cardiologist ECG rhythm normal , cardiologist QI sign Case Report form , indicate participant eligible enrollment . If determine ECG read participant eligible , call study coordinator tell incidental finding subsequently inform visit family physician follow-up . The participant may bring consent form home study content signing . Prior leave initial screen visit participant instruct strap omni-directional accelerometer instruct fill log sheet gather information monitor wear take , need evaluate wear time seven day period . Participants instruct return accelerometer next visit , Baseline 1 . Free informed Consent During initial screen visit , candidate meet inclusion criterion , coordinator explain research protocol subject . This do order explain detail requirement protocol answer question potential participant . If potential participant still interested participate study , coordinator distribute , explain answer question regard consent form participant . The participant ask sign inform consent letter . Active Investigational Product Description pms-METHYLPHENIDATE ( methylphenidate hydrochloride ) racemate consist 1:1 mixture d-methylphenidate ( d-MPH ) l-methylphenidate ( l-MPH ) . pms-METHYLPHENIDATE mild central nervous system stimulant prominent effect mental motor activity . The mode action man completely understood , stimulant effect think due cortical stimulation possibly stimulation reticular activate system . There neither specific evidence clearly establish mechanism whereby methylphenidate produce mental behavioural effect child , conclusive evidence regard effect relate condition central nervous system ( CNS ) . Methylphenidate hydrochloride rapidly extensively absorbed tablet follow oral administration ; however , owe extensive first-pass metabolism , bioavailability low ( approx . 30 % ) large individual difference exist ( 11-52 % ) . Peak plasma concentration 10.8 7.8 ng/mL observe , average , 2 hour administration 0.30 mg/kg child adult , respectively . Methylphenidate eliminate plasma mean half-life 2.4 hour child 2.1 hour adult . The apparent mean systemic clearance oral dose 10.2 10.5 L/h/kg child adult , respectively 0.3 mg/kg dose , 0.565 L/h/kg intravenous dose racemate healthy adult volunteer . These data indicate pharmacokinetics methylphenidate hyperactive child similar healthy adult volunteer . The apparent distribution volume methylphenidate child approximately 20 L/kg , substantial variability ( 11-33 L/kg ) . The volume distribution intravenous dose ( Vss ) 2.23 L/kg racemate healthy adult volunteer . Following oral administration methylphenidate , 78-97 % dose excrete urine 1-3 % feces form metabolite within 48-96 hour . The main urinary metabolite ritalinic acid ( a-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid , PPAA ) ; unchanged methylphenidate excrete urine small quantity ( &lt; 1 % ) . Peak PPAA plasma concentration occur approximately time peak methylphenidate concentration , however , level several-fold great unchanged drug . The half-life PPAA approximately twice methylphenidate . Role CHEO Pharmacy Section C.05.010 Division 5 Regulations pertain sponsor 's ( i.e . Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario ) obligation regard Good Clinical Practice . The CHEO pharmacy follow obligations—compliant say Regulations—with respect drug/placebo management : drug acquisition dispensing , maintenance inventory accountability reconciliation record , label study medication , storage inventory , general record patient information form create patient binder . Note Division 5 , Health Canada mandate record must maintain period 25 year , CHEO pharmacy ensure maintenance record keep . Safety Assessments Trial Monitoring Clinical Safety Assessments The following assessment perform determine safety MPH Hydrochloride : vital sign ( blood pressure pulse ) ; monitor effects/symptoms ( side effect checklist ) . Those report show heighten blood pressure heart rate side effect test dos MPH clinical screening visit , e.g. , systolic blood pressure exceed baseline read 20mmHg , diastolic blood pressure exceed baseline read 10mmHg , BP &gt; 160/100 , rest pulse increase 20 beats/minute baseline reading exclude study . Subjective side effect measure 21 potential side effect ( e.g. , headache , nausea , nervousness , etc . ) subject rate intensity symptom use follow scale : 1 = none , 2 = mild , 3 = moderate , 4 = severe . A qualified registered nurse present throughout entire session . Furthermore , thorough emergency plan implement conjunction Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario ( e.g . code blue ) University Ottawa crisis arise . In addition , research unit equip complete first aid unit cart along automated external defibrillator employee train operate . All employee also require maintain valid CPR-C. Each participant supply `` study enrollment card '' study title , along emergency contact information CHEO pharmacy technician ( control study blind ) Qualified Investigator ( Principal Investigator—PI ) . This card act safeguard participant seek emergency medical help require know whether take drug placebo , thereby act aid clinical judgment stop treatment . The enrollment card also act tract if/when participant need unblinded treatment . Trial Management Monitoring Management The Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario Clinical Research Unit ( CHEO-CRU ) coordinate center study University Ottawa test site . The Principal Investigator study coordinator , along CHEO pharmacy , responsible day-to-day operation trial . CHEO-CRU provide CHEO pharmacy randomization table resultantly person unblinded . The randomization take place Initial Screening Visit complete determined participant eligible participate . Therefore , participant equal chance randomize drug placebo use computer generate random number program member CRU enter Baseline 1 test day . Treatment discontinuation In event subject withdrawn study due AE , AE record report , subject follow treated abnormal parameter symptom resolve stabilize . It clinician Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board determine AE either resolve reach stable state , follow-up necessary . Support determination document . The reason withdrawal study record appropriate case report form ( CRF ) . If subject remove study , continue schedule follow-up subject 's permission . There change follow-up schedule , except study treatment/intervention administer . If point subject longer wish participate follow-up , three month follow-up telephone call , participation study complete . If new evidence emerge literature indicate study dosage unsafe , study discontinue qualify patient offer effective/safer treatment . Data Safety Monitoring Board The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) independent group expert function independently arm 's length Study Investigators Steering Committee Study . The primary responsibility DSMB follow : 1. Review evaluate accumulate study data participant safety 2 . Make recommendation Steering Committee base review regard continuation , modification termination trial 3 . DSMB member must maintain strict confidentiality concern privileged trial result , phase DSMB review deliberation . 4 . No member DSMB direct involvement conduct study . No member financial , proprietary , professional interest may affect impartial , independent decision-making DSMB . The DSMB notify serious unexpected adverse drug reaction death within 5 work day knowledge SAE . It Qualified Investigator 's responsibility ensure DSMB apprise new safety information relevant study . The DSMB schedule regular basis often necessary . Regular review conduct yearly focus primarily safety issue . A designated third party analysis ( prepared study statistician ) deliver DSMB two week prior schedule review . Prior study initiation , DSMB member review study protocol , informed consent , Data Safety Monitoring Plans relevant document need ( case report form , manual procedure , etc. ) . During study , DSMB member review study protocol amendment . Adverse Events ( AE 's ) Serious Adverse Events ( SAE 's ) Adverse Events Adverse event ( AEs ) define symptom , sign , illness experience occur participate study , include admission outpatient . Abnormal clinical result consider adverse event abnormality : - result study withdrawal - associate clinical sign symptom - lead additional treatment diagnostic test - consider investigator Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board clinical significance . Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) A SAE adverse event dose : - result death - life-threatening - require inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - result persistent significant disability incapacity - result congenital anomaly/birth defect - serious ( important event ) - prolonged hospitalization , significantly beyond expect length stay - important medical event Serious Unexpected Adverse drug Reactions SAEs likely related study drug . Medical scientific judgment exercise decide whether expedite reporting appropriate situation important medical event may immediately life-threatening result death hospitalization may jeopardize patient may require intervention prevent one event list . Serious Adverse Event Reporting What Report - Any SAE meet definition Reportable Serious Adverse Event - All life-threatening fatal adverse event attribution possible , probable , definite The Sponsor Investigator notify Health Canada ( Office Clinical Trials ) event meet regulatory requirement expedite reporting , ( i.e . event BOTH serious AND unexpected ) , AND think relate protocol treatment ( causal relationship protocol treatment rule ) . Adverse Drug Reaction ( ADR ) report must file case : - ADR neither fatal life-threatening , within 15 day become aware information - fatal life-threatening , immediately possible , event , within 7 day become aware information - within 8 day inform Health Canada ADR , submit complete possible , report assessment importance implication finding This include serious event unexpected related ( i.e . possibly , probably , definitely ) protocol therapy . Investigators must notify Research Ethics Boards ( REBs ) document related submission must retain study binder site . The submission event local ethic board do soon possible ( within 30 day ) per local REB requirement . REB submission great 90 day date notification regard delinquent major deficiency assign . Important medical event may immediately life threatening , clearly major clinical significance . They may jeopardize subject , may require intervention prevent one serious outcomes note . Monitoring AE's/SAE 's : Any AE occurs time study participant/parent sign inform consent form time he/she complete telephone follow-up ( time early discontinuation subject study reason ) capture record . At contact subject , investigator ( designate ) seek information adverse event specific question , appropriate , examination . The intensity AE assess mild ( usually transient nature generally interfere normal activity ) , moderate ( sufficiently discomforting interfere normal activity ) , severe ( prevents normal activity ) . The maximum clinical intensity adverse event classify : - Mild : Signs symptom easily tolerate ignore . - Moderate : Symptoms cause discomfort tolerable ; ignore affect concentration . - Severe : Symptoms affect usual daily activity . The attribution adverse event classify : - Unrelated investigational agent/intervention - Not relate The AE clearly relate intervention - Doubtful The AE likely related intervention - Related investigational agent/intervention - Possible The AE may relate intervention - Probable The AE likely related intervention - Definite The AE clearly relate intervention An adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) untoward medical occurrence PI determines likely related study drug ( attribution possible , probably , definite ) . Feasibility There field study look effect MPH food intake ( neither main outcome secondary outcome ) . Therefore , way estimate effect size extrapolate previous laboratory study . In laboratory study investigator , effect size .93 attain 9 obese adult male primary outcome food intake mean energy intake kilocalorie MPH ( 0.5 mg/kg ) placebo 843.5 + 393.4 1095.9 + 271.1 , respectively . In second study 14 normal weight adult male female , effect size .69 attain , favour MPH ( 0.5 mg/kg ) food intake ad libitum buffet meal mean difference kcals -133 ( 1099 MPH minus 1232 placebo ) , standard deviation 192.0 kcals pair difference base t-tests . Based conservative effect size .69 , would possible detect significant difference kcals consume 60-day period MPH placebo use pair t-test alpha 0.05 , power 0.80 , 18 participant per group . Thus , plan include 40 participant per group enable investigator look trend energy balance ( secondary outcome ) variable , account expect drop-out 5-10 % . The plan run 3 new participants/month , thus experimental part study last approximately 14 month .
