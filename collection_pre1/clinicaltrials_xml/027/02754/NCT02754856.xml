	<brief_title>Tremelimumab ( Anti-CTLA-4 ) Plus MEDI4736 ( Anti-PD-L1 ) Resectable Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , receive FOLFOX bevacizumab vein 2 day Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . Participant also receive tremelimumab vein 1 hour MEDI4736 vein 4 hour Week 11 . After Week 11 , participant receive MEDI4736 alone vein 1 hour Weeks 21 , 25 , 29 , 33 . Between Weeks 15 17 , participant already schedule liver surgery . This mean participant receive FOLFOX , bevacizumab , tremelimumab surgery MEDI4736 surgery . Study Visits : During Week 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test test related participant 's immune system . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample used pregnancy test . Urine may also collect test . During Weeks 3 , 5 , 7 : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - During Week 5 , participant physical exam . Between Weeks 9 11 : - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw test relate immune system . - Participant CT scan . - Participant liver tumor biopsy check status disease biomarker test . To perform tumor tissue biopsy , affect area numb anesthetic small amount tissue remove small needle . Participant also receive anesthesia procedure . This discussed participant detail biopsy . During Week 11 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample used pregnancy test . Urine may also collect test . During Week 15 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test test relate participant 's immune system . - Participant CT scan . Between Weeks 15 17 , participant liver surgery part standard care . Participant sign separate consent form procedure . During Weeks 19 : - Participant also physical exam . - Blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check status disease , test relate participant 's immune system . During Week 21 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood sample used pregnancy test . Urine may also collect test . During Week 25 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Weeks 29 , 44 , 68 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 8 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - Participant CT scan MRI . During Week 33 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test test relate participant 's immune system . During Week 56 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check status disease , test relate participant 's immune system . - Participant CT scan . Length Study : Participant may receive FOLFOX bevacizumab Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . Participant may receive tremelimumab MEDI4736 1 week MEDI4736 alone additional 4 week . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up . Follow-Up : If participant stop treatment reason , ask come hospital study doctor may check health follow ongoing side effect discomfort get good . If disease get well remain , participant 's doctor continue check status disease part standard care , may include image scan and/or blood draws routine test . Follow-up continue 1Â½ year participant withdraws study . This investigational study . MEDI4736 tremelimumab FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . FOLFOX bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 35 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm colorectal cancer metastasis deem resectable general liver surgeon ( resectability may involve use ablative technique liver metastasis ) . Those patient know disease outside liver eligible ( except patient primary lesion place plan resection nonspecific lung metastases &lt; 1cm ) . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) =/ &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . 3 . All line prior therapy accept . Subjects prior hepatic extrahepatic resection metastatic disease include . 4 . Age =/ &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use tremelimumab combination MEDI4736 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 5 . Life expectancy great 6 month . 6 . ECOG performance status =/ &lt; 1 ( Karnofsky =/ &gt; 70 % ) . 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : ) leukocytes =/ &gt; 3,000/mcL ; b ) absolute neutrophil count =/ &gt; 1,500/mcL ; c ) platelets =/ &gt; 100,000/mcL ; ) total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional normal limit ( subject know Gilbert syndrome eligible total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) ; e ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) =/ &lt; 3 X institutional upper limit normal ; f ) creatinine within normal institutional limit OR g ) creatinine clearance =/ &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . 8 . Known MSI , BRAF , KRAS status . 9 . The effect tremelimumab and/or MEDI4736 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason immune checkpoint inhibitor well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 180 day last dose tremelimumab . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 10 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . An exception criterion patient enrol completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . If case 2 week must elapse prior begin immune checkpoint therapy . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder ( include inflammatory bowel disease [ eg , colitis Crohn 's disease ] , diverticulitis [ exception diverticulosis ] , celiac disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sarcoidosis syndrome , Wegener syndrome [ granulomatosis polyangiitis , Graves ' disease , rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc. ] ) . The following exception criterion : ) Patients vitiligo alopecia ; b ) Patients hypothyroidism ( eg , follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement ; c ) Any chronic skin condition require systemic therapy ; ) Patients without active disease last 5 year may include consultation study physician . 4 . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . 5 . Prior exposure T cell checkpoint inhibitor therapy . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen hepatitis C ( IgG RNA test ) indicate acute chronic infection . 8 . Positive test HIV . 9 . Women pregnant , include woman positive pregnancy test enrollment prior administration study medication , breastfeed allow study . 10 . Receipt live vaccine within 30 day study entry .</criteria>
