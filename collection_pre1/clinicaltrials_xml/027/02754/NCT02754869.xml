	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Assessment Small Bowel Motility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal motility refers contractile action gut serve mix food propel digestive tract . Although know involved range condition like chronic constipation , Parkinson 's Crohn 's disease , investigator never effective test study process . Advances medical imaging technology make possible see quantify process non-invasively use MRI . In study investigator first validate MRI base analysis robust valid , produce predictable result range know stimulus . The investigator apply technique cohort participant Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction . These participant know hypo-motile small bowel demonstration MRI technique would serve validation . The investigator also investigate two cohort people without gastrointestinal disease well understand technique may work clinical setting . By end project The investigator generate robust initial evidence validate MRI technique clinical data inform use research .</detailed_description>
