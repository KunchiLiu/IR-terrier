	<brief_title>Evaluation Trima Version 7.0 Platelets 100 % Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design evaluate change Trima Accel software ensure modify software meet FDA acceptance criterion leukoreduction platelet yield . The operating range system flow rate , anticoagulant ratio , storage condition , centrifugal force currently clear Trima Accel system . There change environment storage condition platelet , therefore , vitro vivo platelet quality data collect . This prospective , open-label , multi-center control study evaluate leukoreduction platelet store 100 % plasma collect Trima Accel system Version 7.0 software enhancement . Up 350 healthy adult subject enrol study ensure 93 single , 93 double 93 triple platelet product evaluable data point . Evaluable define complete platelet product meet protocol analysis exclusion criterion . Plateletpheresis per site standard practice per applicable FDA guideline FDA Collection Platelets Automated Methods , December 2007 Guidance Industry Pre-storage Leukocyte Reduction Whole Blood Blood Components Intended Transfusion , September 2012 .
