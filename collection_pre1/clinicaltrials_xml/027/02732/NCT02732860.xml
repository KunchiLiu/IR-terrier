	<brief_title>Personalized Patient Derived Xenograft ( pPDX ) Modeling Test Drug Response Matching Host</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Personalized patient-derived xenograft ( pPDX ) increasingly used tool drug development pre-clinical setting , show recapitulate histology behavior cancer derive . Although , commonly use productively pre-clinical disease model study disease biology drug response , use prospectively inform clinical management . pPDX employed inform clinical decision-making small study , show high concordance individual pPDX patient response therapy . While encourage , role approach breast , colorectal cancer population context genomic drug match strategy remain undefined . This created opportunity evaluate utility pPDX clinical predictor direct use chemo- targeted therapy combination comprehensive genomic epigenetic analysis patient TNBC , CRC select tumor type .</detailed_description>
