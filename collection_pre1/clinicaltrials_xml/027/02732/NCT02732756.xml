	<detailed_description>Teens attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) obtain less sleep peer , 75 % youth ADHD obtain insufficient sleep . This noteworthy since insufficient sleep associate multitude negative outcome typically develop teen , include academic underachievement , emotion dysregulation , mental health problem - outcomes occur high rate among teens ADHD . Our pilot work demonstrate insufficient sleep correlate depression , behavior problem , academic impairment teen ADHD specifically insufficient sleep clearly associate great attentional problem typical teen . However , experimental study examine whether sleep duration causally link attentional , behavioral , emotional , academic impairment teen diagnose ADHD . If sleep problem contribute functional impairment teens ADHD , represent overlook treatment target . Experimental study provide strong test causality , study use at-home sleep restriction protocol teens without ADHD show causal link shorten sleep duration impairment . However , administer at-home sleep restriction protocol may especially challenge teen ADHD due difficulty organize bedtime wake activity , well differences healthy teen biological circadian preference . Thus , critical first step examine sleep causally related impairment teen ADHD document feasibility use at-home sleep restriction protocol population . This study ( 1 ) evaluate feasibility use at-home sleep restriction protocol teen ADHD , ( 2 ) collect preliminary data examine whether shorten sleep duration causally link attentional , behavioral , emotional , academic impairment teen ADHD . These goal accomplish recruit 54 teen ADHD undergo three-week sleep manipulation protocol . Specifically , cross-over design use include week typical sleep follow week sleep restriction sleep extension . Sleep functioning assess three week daily sleep diary objective sleep measurement ( i.e. , actigraphy ) . After sleep condition , teens parent complete subjective objective measure attention , behavior , mood , academic . Findings study allow u identify address barrier administer at-home sleep restriction extension protocol teens ADHD pursue larger-scale experimental research examine sleep problem causally link impairment . This research clinically significant since teen ADHD frequently experience range impairment extend well adulthood . If short sleep duration contribute functional impairment teens ADHD , sleep represent modifiable overlooked treatment target .</detailed_description>
