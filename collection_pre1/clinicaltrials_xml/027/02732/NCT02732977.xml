	<brief_summary>Heart failure grow throughout pathology Europe . It public health issue economic issue . The management effective need early specific . Generic treatment ( medication , rehabilitation , hygienic dietary measure ) know 15 year demonstrate effectiveness , come s'ajouter solution specific , technically complex expensive implement . Because potential risk patient cost company , new technique need adapt case . The passage generic simple treatment everyone single treatment tailor patient require decision support tool clinician . These tool decision tree develop use mathematical statistical model feed patient data ( imaging , biology physiology ... ) implementation treatment . Predictive response model treatment apply particular pathology thus generate . It type model apply systolic heart failure complicate mitral regurgitation / cardiac synchronization generate project 150 patient include 3 European clinical study ( London , Brussels , Caen ) . In Caen include 30 patient single-center study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) clinical problem increasingly common throughout Europe , partly age population increase number patient survive myocardial infarction [ 1 , 2 ] . The IC progressive disease patient require hospitalization , long-term prognosis poor [ 3 ] . The treatment IC focus improve work fail heart via use specific drug , necessary cardiovascular intervention correct structural lesion ( mitral regurgitation ) correct disorganize contraction ( therapy resynchronization ) . However , IC disease complex multiple factor pathophysiological interdependent make difficult treatment choice optimal combination therapeutic optimal . The technology HPV predictive , tool process data , statistical model simulation biophysical incorporate factor pathophysiological tremendous potential help improve understanding response treatment context IC . In particular , potential improve selection patient cardiovascular intervention cardiac resynchronization therapy / intervention mitral valve [ 4 ] . Projects recent - European ( HPV Human physiological virtual ) national - develop large number technology , n'ont fully release environment clinic help care patient IC . The objective VP2HF project develop validate clinical setting computer model platform integrate non-invasive clinical imaging evidence acquire patient heart failure ( IC ) two reason : 1 . Identify patient , likely response different therapeutic intervention clinical data process decision support system . 2 . Optimize response intervention select patient maximize treatment response . This pilot study generate complete data set use parameterize model calculation . All patient accurate image assessment detailed assessment bio-signals time ( time point ) accurate ( show ) variation depend sustain cardiovascular procedure describe . Preoperatively - Evaluation symptom Minnesota Quality Life Questionnaire patient heart failure ( MLHFQ ) - 6 minute walk test - cardiopulmonary stress test ( CPET ) ass VO2 max - Reference initial Blood test ( CBC , urea electrolyte , NT-proBNP ) - 2D 3D cardiac echocardiography - Cardiac MRI include myocardial tattoo 3D sequence ( tag 3D ) 4D sequence blood circulation - Non-invasive measurement central blood pressure Peri-interference Whatever treatment envisage surgical team charge processing ( resynchronization , mitral clip , mitral valve repair mitral valve replacement ) operative technique monitoring procedure normally use operator . Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) consider 70 % patient cohort eligible CRT also eligible project . Invasive measurement leave ventricular pressure without stimulation may also acquire study acute hemodynamic effect CRT make comparison extent NBP order test validate noninvasive pressure estimate mechanical modeling tool . Repair replacement mitral valve : It expect 30 % cohort patient significant mitral regurgitation require intervention , mainly repair mitral valve occasional replacement mitral valve repair unsuccessful . In patient , repair carry trans-catheter track hemodynamic measurement aorta , leave ventricle leave atrium repair mitral valve use purpose test validate non-invasive estimate pressure mechanical modeling tool . Immediately surgery All patient echocardiography , non-invasive measurement central blood pressure . Followed 6 month We perform , 6 month surgery , complete postoperative evaluation unless cardiac MRI patient CRT ( review - indicate ) . addition standard care pathway exams non-invasive measurement central blood pressure The non -invasive blood pressure management Centron Diagnostics use humeral standard oscillatory cuff estimate PA peripheral central aortic pressure . For patient , experiment similar automatic blood pressure record . All patient benefit measure . Exams IRM3T Cyc√©ron ( M0 M6 )</detailed_description>
