	<brief_summary>Recent year , woman infertility become thus assisted reproductive technology apply broad range . And quantity twin pregnancy large large . However , complicate twin pregnancy subsequently increase include selective intrauterine growth restriction ( sIUGR ) , twin growth discordance , twin transfusion syndrome ( TTTS ) intrauterine fetal death ( IUFD ) . The occurrence complicate twin pregnancy lead cause morbidity mortality twin mother . Meanwhile , twin pregnancy , especially monochorionic type suffer high rate chromosomal anomaly structural anomaly . Therefore , important attention pay prediction , clinical evaluation occurrence chromosomal anomaly structural anomaly complicate twin pregnancy . So far , prenatal ultrasound acknowledge best method prenatal diagnosis evaluation twin pregnancy . By mean application prenatal ultrasound , detection fetal chromosome , secondary correlation analysis , investigator try build prenatal ultrasound monitor system twin pregnancy provide evidence choice intervention delivery time , order decrease morbidity mortality twin improve perinatal short long outcome . The goal study : ( 1 ) primary goal : prediction complicate twin pregnancy use prenatal ultrasound ; ( 2 ) primary goal : clinical evaluation perinatal outcomes twin pregnancy use prenatal ultrasound ; ( 3 ) secondary goal : analysis correlation prenatal ultrasound fetal anomaly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Value Prenatal Ultrasound Complicated Twin Pregnancy Its Correlation With Chromosomal Anomalies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design observational prospective cohort study . The primary outcome complicate twin pregnancy ( sIUGR , TTTS , IUFD , twin growth discordance ) . The main exposed factor discordance crown-rump length 20 % , discordance nuchal translucency 20 % , either twin abnormal amniotic fluid ( polyhydramnios oligoamnios ) , either twin abnormal umbilical artery flow ( elevate resistance index , absent reverse diastolic flow ) , either twin abnormal middle cerebral artery flow ( 1.5Mom ) , either twin abnormal ductus venous flow ( absent reverse a-wave ) . Meanwhile , demographic data collect confound factor analyze . Women twin pregnancy examine department enrol study . Ultrasound do 11-13+6 week , 16-18 week , 22-24 week , 30-32 week 37-39 week , perinatal outcomes collect , include diagnosis complicate twin pregnancy , happen , ultrasound index , delivery mode , delivery time , birth weight , neonatal outcome . When indication detection fetal chromosome , woman probably advise examination , non-invasive DNA , amniocentesis , umbilical cord screening , appropriate , write informed consent achieve every patient .</detailed_description>
