	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether surgical treatment , balloon kyphoplasty effective compare conservative treatment alone ( sham procedure ) assess clinical , translational , radiological &amp; patient outcome patient multiple myeloma . Subjects recruit study VAS score ≥ 6 give informed consent participate Melody Study randomise Arm 1 Sham Procedure Conservative treatment Arm 2 Balloon Kyphoplasty Conservative treatment . Subjects recruit Arm 1 ( Sham Procedure Conservative treatment ) cross Arm 2 ( Balloon Kyphoplasty Conservative Treatment ) VAS score ≥ 6 8-12 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Compare Conservative Management Vs . Balloon Kyphoplasty Treatment VCFs Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) account 10 % malignant haematological disease approximately 1 % cancer-related death Western country . MM characterise accumulation malignant plasma cell bone marrow lead impaired haematopoiesis high incidence bone involvement among malignant disease . MM bone disease result increase destruction bone compensate new bone formation . Approximately 80 % patient MM develop skeletal complication include bone pain , hypercalcemia , osteoporosis , osteolytic lesion pathologic fracture . Vertebral fracture may associate spinal cord compression neurological complication require surgery and/or radiotherapy . Osteolytic bone destruction debilitate manifestation MM , severe impact patient ' quality life responsible increase morbidity mortality . Furthermore , bone resorption activity show independent risk factor overall survival patient symptomatic MM . Moreover , myeloma-associated lytic bone lesion repair , even patient disease free year . More 50 % patient develop vertebral compression fracture ( VCFs ) either time diagnosis course diagnose disease . These fracture compromise spinal cord patient ' height stature , cause angulation spine , increase sternum pressure , eventually result sternal fracture compromise pulmonary capacity . 9 % loss predict forced vital capacity associate vertebral fracture . Deformity , Insomnia , depression , substantial physical , functional psychological impairment ultimately disability result severe vertebral compression fracture poorly manage presentation . Management spinal MM bone disease 1 . Bisphosphonates use bisphosphonates , inhibit bone reabsorption , treatment MM bone disease lead improvement quality life patient MM . 2 . Conservative ( non-surgical ) management ( standard care management patient multiple myeloma ) 1 . Pain relief 2 . Systemic chemotherapy Myeloma disease 3 . Bed rest 4 . Radiotherapy 5 . Physiotherapy 3 . Standard surgical procedure A . Open surgical decompression Anterior posterior decompression stabilisation internal fixation hardware bone grafting ( &lt; 0.5 % gross spinal deformity neurologic impairment ) . Higher morbidity mortality MM patient comorbid condition related age , disease associate end-organ damage immunosuppression B. Minimally invasive - Cement Augmentation 1 . Percutaneous Vertebroplasty 2 . Percutaneous Kyphoplasty ( i.e . Balloon Kyphoplasty ) COST BURDEN , HEALTH ECONOMIC IMPACT AND COST UTILITY ANALYSIS There little evidence difference across health system choice outcome multiple myeloma treat conservative treatment , chemotherapy spinal surgery three many treatment option manage multiple myeloma . The true cost associate current therapy addition supportive care , significant pose tremendous financial burden patient health care provider . There therefore need begin systematically optimise guidance treatment subgroup patient especially compare two treatment arm study , conservative treatment alone versus surgical treatment , balloon kyphoplasty . This study determine cost burden , health economic impact cost utility analysis combine quality life measurement , cost analysis allow calculation relative cost-effectiveness conservative treatment standard care versus standard care plus balloon kyphoplasty.17 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY Osteolytic lesion vertebral body frequent problem multiple myeloma patient predispose severe pain , vertebral fracture consequent neurological complications.Open surgical procedure stabilise correct deform vertebral body associate major complication group immunocompromised patient . In addition , open procedure often possible , due severely impaired strength bone tissue , allow safe application screw plat . As result standard management reduce local pain secondary vertebral compression fracture many year pain relief , radiotherapy element conservative management list . The development minimally invasive procedure kyphoplasty vertebroplasty demonstrate additional effective treatment option improve mobility quality life reduce pain . Percutaneous vertebroplasty involves injection acrylic bone cement vertebral body order relieve pain and/or stabilise fracture vertebrae case , restore vertebral height . Percutaneous Kyphoplasty ( Balloon Kyphoplasty ) perform insert balloon-like device ( inflatable bone tamp ) channel create hand drill fracture vertebra . The tamp position inserted vertebral body . The balloon inflate slowly normal height vertebral body restore balloon reach maximum volume . The procedure intend restore vertebral height correct kyphosis . It may also help improve pulmonary gastrointestinal function reduce likelihood subsequent vertebral compression fracture . The inflation balloon tamp create cavity vertebral body bone tamp withdrawn , bone cement inject cavity lower pressure , potentially reduce risk cement leakage . The cement increase strength vertebra intend provide pain relief .</detailed_description>
