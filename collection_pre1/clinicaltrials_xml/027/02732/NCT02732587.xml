Subjects participate two lab session , one prior take medication one follow 8-11 day AZD0530 . During session , participant receive successive dos alcohol 90 min period design raise blood alcohol level 80 mg/dl ; dose chosen close legal limit intoxication peak BAC observe prior research studies.Subjects monitor throughout lab session receive phone call two day follow 2nd lab session follow-up appointment one week 2nd lab session ass remain side effect medication . Once determined change pharmacokinetics alcohol AZD0530 , well difference behavioral cognitive response alcohol presence AZD0530 , investigator begin pilot study examine effect two dos AZD0530 behavioral measure relate alcohol self-administration follow fix dose alcohol alcohol abusive dependent heavy drinker , compare response obtain historical control treat placebo Study 1 .
