In 2006 national study find 5.8 million old adult ( 16 % ) report fall prior 3 month period 1.8 million injured . Falls fall-related injury important impact mobility , functioning , quality life old adult , many , result catastrophic mobility decline , loss independence institutionalization . The trend fall age population make critical problem time . Current evidence guideline recommend assessment several important risk factor provide individualize intervention old adult increase risk fall . Strength , balance gait training among potent intervention element . Evidence show fall risk benefit gain exercise completely lose within 12 week exercise continue . Therefore , persistence exercise physical activity critical long-term success fall prevention treatment . The propose project test feasibility preliminary efficacy innovative group-based fall prevention program call Living In Fitness Together ( LIFT ) . The program consist group-based physical therapy strength , balance , mobility flexibility training , individualized home program include walk physical activity , train group member support coach toward meet exercise physical activity goal . It consist 8 group session 6 week plus one group booster session deliver physical therapist , occupational therapist trained staff . The program design deliver progressive , tailor , challenge exercise intervention older adult risk fall empower old adult meet goal exercise physical activity train self-management , peer-coaching within exercise group . The aim project test feasibility implement fall prevention program peer-coaching context physical therapy practice , assess safety initial efficacy . The result study foundation formal clinical trial novel program exercise peer- coaching exercise adherence . This program potential incorporate physical therapy practice disseminate widely , important impact number fall fall-related injury occur old adult .</detailed_description>
