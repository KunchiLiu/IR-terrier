	<detailed_description>Respiratory dysfunction follow cardiac surgery well document due part location incision nature surgery ( Weissman , 2000 ; Garcia-Delgado M , et al. , 2014 ) . Patients undergoing cardiac surgery increase risk postoperative pulmonary complication include hypoxemia , atelectasis , pneumonia ( Weissman , 2000 ; Garcia-Delgado M , et al. , 2014 ; O'Donohue WJ , 1992 ) ; increase risk older individual individual obstructive lung disease ( Crowe &amp; Bradley , 1997 ; Weissman 2000 ; Jensen et al. , 2007 ) . Standard postoperative care include early mobility deep breathing coughing ( DB &amp; C ) ( Stiller K , et al. , 1995 ; Johnson D. , et al. , 1996 ) usually initiate within first 24 hour follow surgery . Although standard care sufficient instance , postoperative pulmonary complication ( PPCs ) remain significant problem follow cardiac surgery cause prolong length stay hospital increase morbidity mortality ( Weissman , 2000 ; Garcia-Delgado M , et al. , 2014 ) significant number patient . Positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) therapy think increase lung volume facilitate secretion clearance many population ( Orman J &amp; Wasterdahl E , 2009 ) show particularly effective individual obstructive lung disease ( Bott et al . , 2009 ) . In consideration well documented respiratory dysfunction observe follow cardiac surgery , PEP therapy may serve promise treatment facilitate recovery older , 'higher risk ' individual follow elective cardiac surgery . Thus , purpose study investigate whether addition oscillate PEP therapy effective standard treatment alone improve functional status time discharge , well decrease oxygen requirement incidence postoperative pulmonary complication ( e.g. , pneumonia , atelectasis , pneumothorax , pleural effusion ) 'high risk ' patient undergo elective cardiac surgery . Participants recruit London Health Sciences Centre London Ontario . Patients decide proceed elective cardiac surgery screen surgeon 's office , pre-admission clinic 6-inpatient ward eligibility participate study provide letter information . Each patient require provide write consent order participate study . The study approve Health Sciences Research Ethics Board Western University . Patients consent participation study see research coordinator patient 's pre-operative clinic appointment research coordinator explain purpose nature study obtain write informed consent . Also , time , patient demographic information collect , well baseline data chest x-ray ( CXR ) six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) . Pre-operative 6MWTs perform standardized 30 meter track basement University Hospital comply American Thoracic Society Guidelines ( 2002 ) . Patients enrol study randomize one two group day surgery ; OPEP treatment sham treatment group . On day surgery post-operative day ( POD ) 1 , research coordinator bring device ( OPEP sham depend randomization ) patient 's room . The sham device manufacture externally identical OPEP device allow patient blinding , however sham device contain internal mechanism provide expiratory pressure . All patient ( sham OPEP ) see physiotherapist day extubation receive instruction properly use device , addition receive standard post-operative care . Patients instructed set resistance device high set perform 15 breath sit position least twice per wake hour . The resistance number repetition may decrease adjust patient tolerance deem appropriate treating physiotherapist . Compliance measure log book complete patient and/or family . Patients reassess physiotherapist POD # 2 # 3 ensure proper technique compliance device . All patient continue receive standard care day per clinical pathway may receive additional cardiorespiratory PT technique deem necessary PT . Patients instructed continue OPEP treatment ( sham OPEP ) describe POD # 5 . Outcome assessment conduct blinded assessor . The outcome time outcome assessment describe outcome measure section terminate POD # 7 discharge hospital , whichever occur first . If patient require continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) , reintubation period , instruct stop use OPEP device outcome assessment occur POD # 7 .</detailed_description>
