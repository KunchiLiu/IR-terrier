	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate effect perioperative music maternal anxiety , hemodynamic response spinal anesthesia , postoperative pain medication requirement , overall maternal satisfaction . Investigators hypothesize woman expose perioperative music great overall satisfaction delivery experience . Investigators also hypothesize perioperative music lower anxiety level woman schedule cesarean delivery , result less profound degree spinal-induced hypotension prior cesarean delivery , result lower requirement analgesic postpartum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Music Satisfaction , Anxiety , Hemodynamics During Spinal Anesthesia Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study demonstrate preoperative anxiety associate profound hypotension spinal anesthesia cesarean delivery . Music show positive impact hemodynamic response patient satisfaction . To investigator knowledge , however , study evaluate effect music perioperative period cesarean delivery patient satisfaction hemodynamic response . The study conduct randomize unblended control trial three study arm : control ( music ) , intervention - Pandora® ( patient select music ) , intervention - Mozart ( pre-selected relaxing music ) . Eligibility criterion include pregnant woman , 18 year old , schedule elective cesarean delivery spinal anesthesia . Exclusion criterion include absolute contraindication neuraxial anesthesia include patient refusal , uncorrected coagulopathy , infection skin site epidural placement , increase intracranial pressure , untreated hemodynamic instability . Patients active labor , impaired hearing , want participate study also exclude . All subject recruit woman admit scheduled cesarean delivery Brigham Women 's Hospital . Investigators anticipate enrol 150 patient , 50 patient arm study . Participation begin time consultation day surgery , end post-anesthesia check postoperative day 1 . After recruitment consent , patient randomize use computer-generated randomization scheme use allocate patient one arm study . The three arm study follow : 1 . Control group : baseline hemodynamics anxiety screen ; music 2 . Intervention group - Pandora : A study investigator create station Pandora® music application base patient 's preferred music genre artist . 3 . Intervention group - Mozart : A study investigator turn playlist pre-selected Mozart music . At time recruitment , patient demographic data vitals sign collect . A baseline anxiety screen obtain ( group ) use verbal analog scale ( VAS ) anxiety score abbreviate State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) questionnaire . Thirty minute prior spinal anesthesia cesarean delivery designate music group music initiate , describe . 30 minute completion spinal placement , patient hemodynamics vasopressor requirement ( phenylephrine , ephedrine ) evaluate co-investigator 5 minute interval . Thirty minute arrival post-anesthesia care unit postpartum , postpartum anxiety screen obtain ( group ) use VAS STAI questionnaire . On postpartum day 1 , patient enrol study evaluate within 24 hour spinal anesthetic .</detailed_description>
