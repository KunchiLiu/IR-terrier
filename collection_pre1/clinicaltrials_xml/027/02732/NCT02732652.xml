	<brief_summary>In study , score base glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) profile subject suspicion renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) hypothesize distinguish malignant mass early actionable clinical decision desirable . For example screen population risk distinguish benign mass RCC patient refer surgery . To end , plasmatic urinary GAGs measure prospectively enrol subject result score correlate post-surgical definitive diagnosis eventual RCC size . A positive significant correlation suggestive GAG profiling use guide clinical intervention subject risk refer nephrectomy suspicion RCC . The biomarker patient high risk RCC monitor observe correlation disease progression . Also , biological significance positive correlation evaluate use gene expression profile . This data may also use improve diagnostic accuracy propose biomarker .</brief_summary>
