	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient Long-Term Home Oxygen Therapy ( LTOT ) reduction airflow totally reversible . This obstruction may associate abnormal inflammatory response lung result inhalation toxic particle , particularly cigarette smoke . Furthermore , COPD patient also present limit symptom physical exercise , significant extrapulmonary effect , include weight loss , nutritional abnormality skeletal muscle dysfunction . Hyperinflation identify major cause dyspnea currently believe already present early stage disease , cause limitation physical capacity . The progressive exertional dyspnea associate impairment activity daily live , decrease quality life bad prognosis . Traditionally , severity COPD define degree obstruction , measure forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) bronchodilator use ( post-BD ) classify mild , moderate , moderately severe severe disease . In group patient Advanced Pulmonary Disease ( APD ) , partial pressure value oxygen ( PaO2 ) low equal 55mmHg , arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) low equal 88 % ambient air ; PaO2 value 55-60 SaO2 low 90 % , evidence pulmonary hypertension polycythemia require LTOT , 15 hour / day , evidence increase survival . The aim study evaluate erythrocyte membrane stability COPD APD patient LTOT compare healthy subject . It cross-sectional , observational study evaluation erythrocyte membrane stability among group well lung function , physical testing , laboratory analysis , oxidative stress quality life questionnaire . As red blood cell cell responsible gas exchange lung peripheral tissue , since patient COPD APD gas exchange impairment compare healthy group , expect find difference erythrocyte membrane stability level oxidative stress among group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>COPD major cause illness death worldwide , represent significant economic social cost . In household , cause concern , limit social life leisure ; commits budget shorten life . In professional field , reduce productivity , anticipate retirement result pension payment benefit . In area health system , motivates repeat call emergency room , outpatient clinic frequent cause hospitalization , cause high cost government society . Most case attribute smoke . COPD often develop middle-aged smoker long time exposure variety disease related smoking age . COPD also significant extra-pulmonary effect ( systemic ) lead comorbid condition . Nutritional abnormality , weight loss skeletal muscle dysfunction well-recognized extrapulmonary effect COPD patient high risk myocardial infarction , osteoporosis , respiratory infection , bone fracture , depression , sleep disorder , anemia glaucoma . Thus , study aim investigate erythrocyte membrane stability patient COPD compare healthy individual , since loss damage red blood cell may relate worsen gas exchange patient cause , example , increase oxidative stress observe disease mechanism COPD patient , especially advanced lung disease . Cross-sectional , observational study , compare COPD patient Advanced Lung disease use Long-Term Home Oxygen Therapy healthy subject evaluate presence difference membrane stability red blood cell well difference pulmonary function test , physical test , laboratory analysis presence oxidative stress , well quality life . The result obtain analysis erythrocyte membrane stability , well oxidative stress functional laboratory test correlate , patient COPD Long-Term Home Oxygen Therapy control group order establish relationship variable also compare group determine difference among .</detailed_description>
