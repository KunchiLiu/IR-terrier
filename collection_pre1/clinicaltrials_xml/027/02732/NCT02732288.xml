	<detailed_description>Patients severe brain injury often slow accumulate recovery function . Recently , National Institute Disability Rehabilitation Research ( NIDRR ) publish data long-term outcome 9,000 patient , 400 suffer disorder consciousness ( Nakase-Richardson et al . 2012 ) . Patients follow 1 , 2 , 5 year outcomes several important unexpected result obtain : large majority patient initially minimally conscious state ( MCS ) continue improve recover consciousness within year recovery demonstrate continue 2 5 year timepoints many 20 % patient . In case outcomes include vocational reentry . Other study confirm MCS recovery occur long-time period lead good outcome significant recovery meaningful cognitive function despite endure convalesce MCS ( Luaute et al . 2010 , Lammi et al . 2005 ) . In ongoing study discover element electrical activity sleep may correlate level behavioral recovery observe patient ( Forgacs et al . 2014 , Thengone et al . 2012 ) . It unknown , however , whether change causally link behavioral recovery . Forgacs et al . 2014 show cross- sectional relationship retention key element sleep EEG architecture behavioral level . Thengone et al . 2012 correlate longitudinal change sleep architecture quantitative spectral measure behavioral recovery 4 patient severe brain injury . No study , however , use instrumental causal design address whether improvement sleep architecture promote patient severe brain injury , whether change wakeful behavioral level causally link instrumentally generate change sleep . Sleep process associate several critical process support cellular integrity neuron neuronal mechanism associate learn synaptic modification give face validity approach . ( Steriade , 1999 ; Tononi Cirelli , 2012 ) . For example , study healthy volunteer ( Huber et al . 2004 ) provide evidence local spindle density change associate learn specific information sleep period topographically related cortical population engage wakeful learning process . Additional evidence indicate recovery spindle within electrical architecture sleep associate recovery motor function stroke ( Gottselig , 2002 ) . Collectively , although limited number study exist biological basis improvement sleep architecture potentially drive recovery reorganization brain network organize wakeful behavior . These known association suggest possibility target normalization brain electrical activity sleep may aid recovery process . In fact , one human subject study program , central thalamic deep brain stimulation ( CT-DBS ) apply begin 20 year severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) correlate normalization sleep architecture begin time exposure continuous DBS . These finding strongly suggest link increase drive synaptic activity day modification sleep process subject expose CT-DBS daytime hour ( Adams et al 2014 ) . These finding improve likelihood bi-directional causal relationship sleep dynamic wakeful brain dynamic link change behavior . Thus , work hypothesis present study causal intervention normalize sleep process patient severe brain injury may aid recovery behavioral function . A well-studied mechanism organize normal pattern electrical activity characterize sleep body 's release substance melatonin . Melatonin produce brain release precise time day ( normally around 8-10PM ) signal brain initiate aspect sleep process day ( Dijk , 1997 ) . It possible exogenously trigger drive melatonin signal sleep process initiation sleep via oral dose agent ( Lewy et al . 1992 ) . Use oral melatonin supplement common pre- treatment expect travel delay sleep disturbance ( `` jet lag '' ) investigate treatment mood disorder ( Lewy et al . 1996 ) . Thus , propose study effect melatonin administration patient severe structural brain injury disorder consciousness . An exist , though small , literature support probable success study ; neurodegenerative patient melatonin supplementation show modest benefit improve cognitive noncognitive symptom ( Riemersma-van der Lek et al . 2008 ) . Pediatric patient traumatic brain injury consider treatment melatonin base similar consideration ( Keegan et al . 2013 ) What : We measure patient 's timing release melatonin provide dose melatonin standard time night ( 8PM ) test effect electrical activity sleep three month period . In addition brain electrical activity , record sleep behavioral data physical activity use activity monitor wear patient . Patient subject study study twice three month period three day inpatient visit undergo video monitoring sample brain electrical activity use paste electrode ( `` EEG '' ) , hourly saliva sample one day , participate behavioral test . Why risk proportionate ? Melatonin safe limit known adverse effect profile ( Buscemi al . 2004 ) Melatonin accumulate stop . We carefully monitor first dose in-patient stay . Moreover , ethical frame study clear intention treat . If hypothesis support patient meaningfully improve function .</detailed_description>
