	<brief_summary>Human adipose tissue recognize acceptable , highly abundant source adipose-derived regenerative cell ( ADRCs ) . ADRCs heterogeneous mixed population cell find adipose tissue include adult stem cell , leukocyte , connective tissue vessel-associated cell . Autologous adult regenerative cell think promote heal scar injured tissue . While investigator learn exact mechanisms every day , believe heterogeneous population cell influence local environment via cell-to-cell signaling , immune modulation , differentiation cell type . The use ADRCs treatment many different medical condition ( include cardiovascular disease , soft tissue defect , wound heal , many ) evaluate numerous clinical preclinical study around world . While considerable amount information regard cellular composition ADRCs isolate healthy donor , basically much data regard ADRC composition cardiac patient . In study , adipose tissue cell chronic heart ischemia patient , would otherwise throw away waste , provide researcher study cell objective characterize ADRCs derive patient heart disease compare heart disease state impact ADRC cell composition .</brief_summary>
