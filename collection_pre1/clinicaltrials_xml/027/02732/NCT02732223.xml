	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis , one major cause morbidity mortality worldwide , complex multifactorial disease trigger especially due high level plasma lipid involve three mainly condition : chronic inflammation , dyslipidemia oxidative stress . Taking account high cost disease management , eminent suboptimal response low compliance drug therapy , combine use natural bioactive compound able reduce atherosclerosis risk could provide additional protection . In study , effect three bioactive component , namely omega-3 fatty acid , plant sterols polyphenols present green tea , evaluate atherosclerosis biomarkers individual dyslipidemia control drug . It carry randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover clinical study , participation 70 subject . At intervention period , study participant receive package functional placebo treatment . Functional treatment package composed omega 3 softgels ( fish oil ) , chocolate containing plant sterol green tea . Placebo treatment compose corn oil softgels , regular chocolate , anise tea . Subjects advise consume softgels chocolate twice day main meal drink two cup tea per day . After evaluation inflammation , dyslipidemia oxidative stress biomarkers , subject great response functional treatment select additional 6 week functional intervention associate reduction hypolipidaemic drug intake , prescribe individually evaluation responsible physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From eligible subject , 70 participant recruit first visit , give informed consent . Also first visit , medical report confirm participant , anthropometric measure record blood sample collect . After first blood analysis result , participant stable parameter call second visit enrol randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover trial , 4 treatment period 6 week , correspond total 7 visit . At visit , blood sample anthropometric measure collect . At first intervention period , study participant receive package functional control treatment . Functional treatment package composed omega 3 softgels ( fish oil ) , chocolate containing plant sterol green tea . Control treatment compose soy oil softgels , regular chocolate , anise tea . Subjects advise consume 3 softgels 1 chocolate twice day , main meal , drink two cup tea per day . After 6-weeks washout period ( third visit ) , group switch ( crossover ) participant receive functional control treatment 6 week ( fourth visit ) . After biomarkers evaluation , subject great response functional treatment select additional 6 week functional intervention associate reduction hypolipidaemic drug ( statin ) dosage , prescribe individually evaluation responsible physician .</detailed_description>
