	<brief_summary>After reopen infarct relate artery primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) , microvascular damage relate myocardial territory terminate immediately . This ongoing nature microvascular damage lead myocardial malperfusion relate final infarct size . However , time course microvascular impairment /obstruction PPCI patient present ST-elevating acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) know . Routine primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) include balloon angioplasty ( thrombectomy ) follow immediately stent implantation . However , stent implantation perform thrombotic setting may lead microvascular damage cause distal embolisation induce distal microvascular spasm stretch coronary vessel wall . Furthermore , sudden exposure distal microcirculation high distal intracoronary pressure achieve immediate stent implantation may exaggerate myocardial oedema contribute microvascular damage substantially external compression . However , result study investigate efficacy delay stenting ( 24-48 hour later ) patient TIMI -3 flow achieve balloon angioplasty inconsistent . In study , STEMI patient undergo PPCI , epicardial reperfusion achieve ( TIMI-3 flow ) wire cross balloon angioplasty aspiration thrombectomy , randomise immediate delay stenting group . Delayed stenting performed time coronary auto regulation recover go determine base continuous intracoronary hemodynamic monitoring reperfusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gradual Versus Abrupt Reperfusion Primary PCI ( GUARD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show ischemia/reperfusion model reopen occlude epicardial coronary artery , follow initial hyperemic flow , myocardial blood flow area risk rapidly progressively decline get stabilise approximately within 30 minutes.This find implies , spite initial ischemic insult , coronary auto-regulation reperfused myocardial territory recovers . Nevertheless , recovery require time reperfusion achieve . During total occlusion epicardial coronary artery , pre-arteriolar sphincter expect paralysed widely open position response severely increase distal myocardial demand . Ischemic myocyte damage also contribute malfunction pre-arteriolar sphincter . Therefore , full restoration perfusion pressure distal infarct relate artery immediate stenting ( direct angioplasty ) may fail induce immediate adaptive autoregulatory response ( compensatory vasoconstriction ) relate microvascular territory , result inappropriately increase pressure damage microcirculation . During total epicardial occlusion , ischemia/hypoxia induced damage increase permeability capillary level lead loss structural integrity relate microvascular territory . After immediate stenting , severely damage microcirculation expose suddenly increase uncontrolled intracoronary pressure may consequently substantially contribute intramyocardial haemorrhage oedema . Therefore , hypothesise gradual reperfusion delay stenting perform coronary auto regulatory function recover may lessen myocardial oedema and/or haemorrhage preventing/limiting uncontrolled increase pressure distal microcirculation . The recovery coronary autoregulatory function reperfused STEMI patient assess continuous monitoring coronary ( microvascular ) blood flow resistance value restoration epicardial blood flow balloon angioplasty individual basis . In study , follow establishment TIMI-3 flow balloon angioplasty , patient randomize immediate delay stenting group . Continuous intracoronary hemodynamic monitorization perform re-opened infarct relate artery use coronary guide wire equip pressure flow sensor total 1hour group . In delayed stent group , stent implantation perform individual basis coronary hemodynamic data indicate coronary autoregulation recover ( initial hyperaemic flow response subside baseline microvascular resistance increase ) . Recovery autoregulatory function determine identification stabilisation baseline coronary flow velocity baseline microvascular resistance infarct relate artery balloon angioplasty . Stabilization decide compare basal coronary flow velocity microvascular resistance value measure non-infarct related coronary artery immediately PPCI value measure re-opened infarct relate artery . When baseline flow velocity resistance value record IRA get close value measure non-IRA , IRA stented . Intracoronary pressure flow data continuously monitor end 1 hour follow-up period . In immediate stenting group , stent implantation perform immediately follow angioplasty . Intracoronary pressure flow data continuously monitor use dual sensor coronary guide wire end 1 hour follow period .</detailed_description>
