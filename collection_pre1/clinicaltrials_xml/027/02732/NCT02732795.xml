	<brief_summary>Adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) one common pediatric surgery perform , estimate comprise 530,000 procedure child 15 year age . Historically , lead cause procedure recurrent infection ; however , recently surgical indication include sleep disordered breathe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Pre-operative polysomnography ( PSG ) recommend child suspect OSA prior undergo AT , although unclear whether sleep disorder breathe characteristic predict post-operative outcome complication . Obesity become epidemic pediatric population . More recently , increase population obese child present AT upper airway obstruction without tonsillar hypertrophy , similar adult etiology OSA . Obesity multisystem disease , cause fatty liver cardiac disease , defect glucose metabolism , insulin resistance , leptin resistance , create state chronic inflammation . Markers inflammation , include TNF-Î± , CRP , leptin , IL-6 IL-10 , abnormal obese patient also link severe OSA disease child even control BMI . In pediatrics , medication dose base actual body-weight calculation , however , recent report suggest dose method over-dosing patient obesity . Therefore , increase respiratory complication surgery may relate inappropriate intra-operative opioid dosing . Specific Aim 1 ( SA1 ) : To compare analgesic-guided opioid dose use actual body weight ( ABW ) base dose versus ideal body weight ( IBW ) dose adenotonsillectomy child OSA ( BMI &gt; /=75 % ) . The investigator hypothesize 1 ) weight-based opioid dosing compare dose base ideal body weight lead increase respiratory complication define ( ) upper airway obstruction , ( b ) hypoventilation , ( c ) oxygen desaturation without affect pain score immediately adenotonsillectomy . In addition , investigator believe 2 ) little statistically significant difference pain score ABW IBW patient . Specific Aim 2 ( SA2 ) : To determine whether biomarkers related obesity , chronic inflammation , OSA predict post-operative respiratory compromise AT . The investigator hypothesize inflammatory obesity-related biomarkers elevate overweight child OSA , obese child OSA , compare lean child OSA .</brief_summary>
