	<detailed_description>A common complication surgery temporary state confusion call postoperative delirium ( PD ) , affect particularly elder patient . Prior study find risk factor PD , present preoperatively , e.g . old age , cognitive impairment , sensory impairment , surgical intervention-related factor , postoperative care . However , preoperative risk PD screen routinely time-consuming require trained personnel . In 2014 , Delirium Risk Profile ( DRP ) , self-administered computer program tablet computer , develop University Hospital Basel assist preoperative screening . It test healthy cognitively impaired volunteer , well patient undergo surgery . The aim study provide normative data computer program DRP , enable clinician administer DRP routinely use tool Preoperative Evaluation Clinic .</detailed_description>
