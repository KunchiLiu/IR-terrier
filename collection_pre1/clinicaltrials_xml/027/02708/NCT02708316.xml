	<brief_summary>Research already find patient autistic spectrum disorder lack Prevotella intestinal type , schizophrenia patient may also show specific intestinal type , investigator want detect gut metagenome schizophrenia patient high-throughput DNA sequencing find specific intestinal type , achieve purpose schizophrenia diagnosis . According detection inflammatory factor blood , nerve growth factor cerebrospinal fluid , find mechanism gut-microbes-brain axis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Gut Metagenome Research Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective observational study conduct case recruit multi-center cooperation . Investigators plan collect 100 schizophrenic patient case group , 100 healthy people control group . Investigators use single drug risperidone treatment schizophrenia patient follow patient day 1 , third week , third month , sixth month first year . There two objective : 1. compare healthy population schizophrenia patient difference gut metagenome inflammatory factor blood , stool sample aim detect difference composition intestinal microorganism ; 2 . Observe change intestinal microorganism , inflammatory factor , γ－aminobutyric acid schizophrenic patient receive risperidone treatment accord blood , stool sample , cerebrospinal fluid follow-up period .</detailed_description>
