	<brief_summary>CKD-MBD ( Chronic Kidney Disease - Mineral Bone Disorder ) extensive disease include dysfunction mineral metabolism , bone metabolism cardiovascular disease context renal insufficiency . Clinical picture peripheral artery occlusive disease ( PAOD ) , Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) arterial hypertension favour among main risk factor ( smoking , obesity , etc . ) additional cardiovascular complication . For reason make sense monitor patient regularly . For purpose determination different biomarkers would appropriate control course disease . During various study biomarkers FGF23 , s-klotho , sclerostin , DKK1 , BMP2 , YKL-40 und MGP establish indicator disease activity , diagnostic criterion existence CKD-MBD risk marker incidence adverse event ( incl . death ) within scope CKD-MBD . For clinical routine care application parameter standard operating procedure ( SOP ) miss determination method relate optimal pre-analytic analytic procedure . These analysis necessary ensure reproducibility study result transfer parameter clinical daily routine risk stratification .</brief_summary>
