Prevention reduction increment important hemodynamic control . In randomized single blind study , aim study compare hemodynamic response two different laryngoscopy technique Glidescope Macintosh laryngoscope coronary cardiac bypass surgery patient . After induction institutional protocol cardiac bypass surgery , hemodynamic data include heart rate , systolic diastolic arterial pressure data record . Time intubation , age , sex , ASA status data also record .</detailed_description>
