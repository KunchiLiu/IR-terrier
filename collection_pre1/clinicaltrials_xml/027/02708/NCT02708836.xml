	<brief_title>Limiting Emergence Phenomena After General Anesthesia With Combined LMA ETT Airway Management Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence general anesthesia critical period anesthetic management ( 1 . Popat , 2012 ) . The noxious stimulus endotracheal tube well excitement stage anesthesia , commonly see prior return consciousness emerge general anesthesia , lead emergence phenomenon coughing , strain , restlessness addition physiologic derangement ( 2 . Atkinson , 1987 ) . Physiologically , emergence anesthesia associate rise sympathetic tone ( evidence elevate catecholamine level resultant hemodynamic change increase heart rate blood pressure ) , intracranial pressure , intraocular pressure . Airway tone reflex also problematic may depress linger pharmacologic effect anesthetic analgesic lead decreased airway obstruction aspiration event . Airway reflex may also exaggerate traverse excitement stage ; lead undesirable consequence cough , breath-holding , buck extreme case laryngospasm . A smooth emergence preferable patient require patient would tolerate physiologic change ( e.g . severe aortic stenosis coronary artery disease , would poorly tolerate tachycardia ) would risk term procedure perform ( cerebral aneurysm clipping , carotid endarterectomy , thyroidectomy : procedure stress fresh surgical wound hypertension strain would undesirable ) . Several airway management ( 3 . Koga 1998 , 4 . Perello-Cerda 2015 ) pharmacologic strategy ( 5 . Minogue 20014 , 6 . Nho 2009 , 7 . Guler 2005 ) employ provide smooth emergence general anesthesia . One efficacious strategy use supraglottic airway device rather endotracheal tube . Despite evidence support safety efficacy ventilation SGAs laparoscopic procedure ( 8 . Natalini 2003 , 9 . Belena 2012 , 10 . Carron 2012 , 11 . Bernardini 2009 ) , many anesthesiologist would prefer use ETT SGA case high ventilation pressure may require ( obesity , steep Trendeleberg position , pneumoperitoneum ) . In addition case require high ventilation pressure , ETTs prefer SGAs patient perceive high risk reflux pulmonary aspiration gastric content ( non-fasted , intestinal obstruction , gastroparesis , parturients ) , well case allow anesthesiologist little accessibility airway ( neurosurgical , ENT , etc ) . The Bailey maneuver ( manage airway ETT throughout case exchange LMA deeply anesthetize ( 12 . Nair 1995 ) , also show provide less stimulating emergence . Unfortunately , Bailey maneuver relatively contraindicated case perception reintubation would difficult , risk exchange function airway device one test outweigh potential benefit smooth emergence . The airway management technique investigation involve initially place LMA induction anesthesia . Once adequate ventilation accomplish use LMA , patient endotracheally intubate use fiberoptic bronchoscope situ LMA conduit ( 13 . Timmermann 2011 ) . General anesthesia maintain sevoflurane narcotic discretion primary anesthesiologist . The patient ventilate via endotracheal tube duration surgical procedure trachea extubated patient deep plane anesthesia release pneumoperitoneum return supine positioning . This technique potential method reduce stress emergence patient would benefit use endotracheal tube intraoperatively .</detailed_description>
