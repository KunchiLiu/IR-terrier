	<brief_summary>Visual puzzle use century facilitate early development kid . Mental Imagery Therapy Autism ( MITA ) unique , early-intervention application child Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . The app include bright , interactive puzzle design help child learn mentally integrate multiple feature object , ability proven lead vast improvement general learning . Success MITA puzzle could overtime result significant improvement child 's overall development , specifically realms language , attention visual skill . SCIENCE BEHIND THE PROJECT : MITA base Pivotal Response Treatment ( PRT ) , one best-supported therapy child diagnose ASD . MITA aim develop one four pivotal skill target PRT : child 's ability notice respond multiple visual cue present simultaneously . This ability typically impaired individual autism , lead commonly describe stimulus overselectivity , `` tunnel vision . '' Improving capacity discern respond multiple cue show reduce stimulus overselectivity , turn lead vast improvement general learning . The visual exercise follow systematic approach develop child 's ability notice multiple characteristic , feature object . MITA start simple exercise teach child attend one feature , size ( see screenshot 1 ) color ( screenshot 2 ) . Over time , exercise get difficult require child attend two feature simultaneously , color size ( screenshot 3 ) . In order solve puzzle , child must learn hold two piece information mind ( size color object ) make decision base combination feature . Once child practice attend two feature , program move puzzle require attend three feature , color , size shape ( screenshot 4 ) , eventually puzzle involve attend ever-increasing number characteristic . As child progress MITA 's systematic exercise , develop ability simultaneously attend great number feature , reduce propensity towards tunnel vision , thus develop essential component language . The ability mentally build image base combination multiple feature absolutely necessary understanding syntax , spatial preposition verb tense . MITA design early childhood intend long-term , daily use . It design engage educational , well adaptive responsive individual ability child .</brief_summary>
