	<brief_title>e-Unstuck : Interactive e-Learning Software Parents Support Executive Functioning Behavior Regulation Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance : The current prevalence Autism Spectrum Disorder 1 68 child , 69 % child intellectual disability ( ASDwoID ) . Individuals ASDwoID considerable risk maladaptive adult outcome ( e.g. , un- underemployment ) , executive functioning ( EF ) impairments significantly contribute risk . Unstuck On Target ( UOT ) empirically support EF intervention specifically target need ASDwoID population . It improve EF social skill child ASDwoID randomize control trial . Despite demonstrated success , significant geographical , scheduling , financial barrier parental adaptation Unstuck On Target ( UOT ) curriculum . Goal Innovation : The goal project develop test e-Unstuck , e-learning intervention ( 1 ) provide advanced training parent child ASDwoID implement evidence-based UOT curriculum home ( 2 ) build 3C 's proprietary , state-of-the-art , Dynamic e-Learning Platform , establish platform high rating quality , value , usability , feasibility end user . e-Unstuck make UOT accessible parent geographical , scheduling , and/or financial constraint provide parent key tool ( e.g. , video modeling , virtual simulation , personalize report ) increase efficacious adoption UOT principle , beyond provide UOT manual . e-Unstuck first dynamically adaptive , personalize , interactive software product specifically design deploy evidence-based EF intervention parent child ASDwoID . Specific Aims : The investigator accomplish five specific aim , two Phase I , three Phase II : ( 1 ) develop prototype e-Unstuck , ( 2 ) conduct feasibility test e-Unstuck parent child ASDwoID age 8-12 , ( 3 ) fully develop e-Unstuck software conduct iterative usability test parent child ASDwoID , ( 4 ) conduct pilot efficacy test 110 parent child ASDwoID randomly assign e-Unstuck intervention control condition receive in-person training UOT curriculum , ( 5 ) prepare e-Unstuck commercialization . Hypotheses : As result pilot efficacy test , investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) parent interact e-Unstuck software report great knowledge use UOT principle , less parent stress great parent sense competence , improve child EF social skill compare control parent , ( 2 ) parent spend time engage intervention show great improvement outcome variable , ( 3 ) parent interact e-Unstuck software find software high quality , value , usability , feasibility . Commercialization Plan : e-Unstuck unique commercial offering within large underserved niche market . Revenue generate direct sale parent child ASDwoID volume sale organization ( e.g. , school , clinic , parent support agency ) work child ASDwoID parent .</detailed_description>
