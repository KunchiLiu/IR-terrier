	<detailed_description>In study , healthy participant randomize one two parallel group : ( ) open-label ketamine active lamotrigine , ( b ) open-label ketamine matched-placebo control ( i.e. , sugar pill ) . All participant complete baseline rs-fMRI approximately 1-week prior ketamine infusion follow-up rs-fMRI 24-hours post-infusion . The subanesthetic dose ketamine ( 0.23mg/kg bolus follow 0.58mg/kg infusion approximately 60 minute ) administer via intravenous infusion occur MRS scan . Participants administer lamotrigine ( 300 mg oral dose ) matched-placebo control 2-hours prior start infusion .</detailed_description>
