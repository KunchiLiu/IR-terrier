	<detailed_description>In medical school around world , speculum examination teach use bivalved speculum , since type speculum commonly use clinical practice . Due oval shape vulva , alignment labium majora minora , aperture vaginal introitus commonly perceive vertical orientation . In reality however , vaginal introitus round vagina horizontal orientation : anterior posterior vaginal wall oppose , sidewalls become apparent anterior posterior wall separate . Nevertheless , common way teach speculum examination worldwide introduce speculum vertical orientation successfully insert vagina rotate 90Â° horizontal position . Once correctly position , slowly open visualize vaginal epithelium cervix . However , clinical practice , rotation speculum vagina may cause pain discomfort . Introduction speculum initially horizontal orientation , without rotation vagina , seem appropriate could potentially associate less discomfort pain woman undergo exam . In practice , minority clinician separate labium first , introduce speculum direct horizontal fashion , thus avoid potentially uncomfortable twist part procedure .</detailed_description>
