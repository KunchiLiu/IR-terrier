	<criteria>1 . All subject 18 65 year age . 2 . Primary Diagnosis Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) confirm structure interview use Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) , version 7 , minimum duration current episode 3 month 3 . Baseline Hamilton Anxiety ( HAMA ) score equal great 18 4 . The baseline EEG sufficient duration quality process quantitative analysis . 5 . Taking less equal 2 psychotropic medication stable dose minimum 2 week remain unchanged throughout duration study . 6 . Subjects willing able adhere intensive treatment schedule require study visit . 1 . Subjects unable unwilling give inform consent . 2 . Primary Diagnosis follow condition confirm MINI ( current unless otherwise state ) : 1 . GAD secondary general medical condition , substanceinduced . 2 .

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) currently treat . 3 . Subjects meet criterion Axis II cluster A B diagnosis base upon Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition , Text Revision ( DSMIVTR ) criterion , judgment Investigator may hinder subject complete procedure require study protocol . 4 . Subjects clinically define neurological disorder include , limited : 1 . Any condition likely associate increase intracranial pressure . 2 . Space occupy brain lesion . 3 . Any history seizure EXCEPT therapeutically induce Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) . Childhood febrile seizure acceptable subject may include study . 4 . History stroke . 5 . Transient ischemic attack within two year . 6 . Cerebral aneurysm . 7 . Dementia ( Montreal Cognition Assessment score le 23 ) . 8 . Parkinson 's disease . 9 . Huntington 's disease . 10 . Multiple sclerosis . 11 . Increased risk seizure reason , include prior diagnosis increase intracranial pressure ( large infarction trauma ) , currently take medication lower seizure threshold . 5 . Subjects follow treatment history : 1 . TMS within 4 week prior screen visit prior treatment sTMS 2 . ECT treatment within 1 year prior screen visit . 3 . Failure respond TMS ECT treatment ( i.e. , consistent Antidepressant Treatment History Form confidence level 3 high ) previous episode . 4 . Lifetime history treatment Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Vagus Nerve Stimulation ( VNS ) . 5 . Use investigational drug device within 6 month screen visit . 6 . Subjects adequately benefit current antianxiety medication ( ) 7 . Significant acute suicide risk judge investigator 8 . Cardiac pacemaker , implanted medication pump , intracardiac line , acute , unstable cardiac disease . 9 . Intracranial implant ( e.g. , aneurysm clip , shunt , stimulators , cochlear implant , stent , electrode ) metal object within near head , exclude mouth , safely remove . 10 . Clinically significant abnormality clinically significant unstable medical condition , indicate medical history , physical examination , ECG result , clinical laboratory testing , Investigator 's judgment might pose potential safety risk subject limit interpretation trial result , e.g. , uncontrolled thyroid disorder , hepatic , cardiac , pulmonary renal malfunctioning . 11 .
