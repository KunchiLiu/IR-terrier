	<brief_title>Improving Diet Exercise Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( IDEAL Weight ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous study , observe : 1 ) nearly half ALL patient overweight obese diagnosis , 2 ) patient , regardless start weight , gain significant fat mass first month therapy ( average 20-30 % ) , 3 ) obesity time diagnosis associate high likelihood poor response chemotherapy evidence persistent leukemia ( minimal residual disease ) induction therapy . Together , data show body fat significant risk factor ALL treatment failure , negative effect evident within first month treatment . Recent laboratory clinical data illustrates ability diet restriction physical activity improve chemotherapy efficacy , reduce treatment-related toxicity well overall quality life . Given importance successful induction therapy ALL predicting long term survival negative role obesity treatment success , study test complete personalize dietary exercise intervention pre-adolescents , adolescent , young adult newly diagnose B-precursor ALL ( `` pre-B ALL '' ) aim reduce fat gain induction therapy thereby improve treatment response , toxicity rate , quality life .</detailed_description>
