	<brief_summary>This prospective , observational , multi-center cohort study pediatric cardiac arrest . The purpose study determine association chest compression mechanic ( rate , depth , flow fraction , compression release ) patient outcome . In addition , investigator determine association post cardiac arrest care patient outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest child major public health problem . Thousands child year USA treat cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) manage cardiac arrest . Neurological outcome follow in-hospital CPR event often abnormal . As child neurological deficit follow CPR major burden family society , improve neurological outcome superior chest compression delivery CPR optimal care management cardiac arrest important clinical goal . Therefore , objective investigation obtain evidentiary support associate relationship quantitative CPR quality data ( depth , rate , chest compression ( CC ) fraction , compression release ) CPR , post-cardiac arrest care ( PCAC ) patient survival child suffer arrest within study ( RES-Q ) Network .</detailed_description>
