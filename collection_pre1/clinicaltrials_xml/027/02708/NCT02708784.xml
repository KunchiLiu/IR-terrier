	<brief_summary>The aim project develop new Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) image technique well diagnosis monitor patient muscular disorder . Muscle quality patient Late Onset Pompe Disease ( Acid Maltase Deficiency type 2 ) patient Myotonica Dystrophy evaluate , determine muscle strength relation muscle size muscle strength relation fat-muscle ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An MRI Study Muscular Diseases -Pompe Disease Dystrophia Myotonica-</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator focus rare Glycogen Storage Disease type 2 ( Pompe Disease ) , genetic disease characterize gradual replacement muscular tissue glycogen fat , result loss muscle mass muscle strength . Pompe disease particular interest since new drug recently develop approve , hitherto untreatable , condition . This treatment expensive , therefore great importance objective method examination monitor disease effect treatment . Until , monitor base primarily physical test 6 min walk test isokinetic dynamometry . These method may sensitive enough detect change short period slowly progressing-diseases . New MRI technique may useful monitoring myopathy . The disease investigator focus Myotonic Dystrophy , great similarity Pompe Disease . As Pompe disease , muscular tissue slowly degenerate fat infiltration occur . Hypothesis In study , investigator want test follow hypothesis : - Intrinsic muscle strength patient Pompe disease Myotonic Dystrophy linear correlate muscle fat volume ratio MR image . - Disease grade patient Pompe disease Myotonic Dystrophy correspond extent fat proliferation muscle low extremity . - Intrinsic muscle strength specific sensitive method reveal effect enzyme replacement treatment patient Pompe 6 minutes-walking-test . Methods Fifteen patient LOPD Denmark Germany ( Münster ) , 15 patient Myotonic Dystrophy 30 control include . The MR protocol include special T1 weight sequence DIXON ( 1x1x3mm3 ; TR : 5.31ms TE : 2.46ms ) enable acquisition muscle fat image 3 Tesla ( Magnetom-Skyra , Siemens AG , Erlangen , Germany ) . The MR scan consist 400 axial slice cover L1 ankle result total scan time 22½ minute . Muscle strength measure isokinetic dynamometry . The measurement do use Biodex System 3 PRO Dynamometer ( Biodex Medical Systems Inc. NY , USA ) standardize protocol developed . Maximal isokinetic strength extensor flexor dominate arm extensor flexor knee , ankle hip non-dominant low extremity measure . There known side effect relate MR-scanning . During examination , subject wear headphone order reduce high sound come scan machine . The scan painless use contrast . The disadvantage person lie motionless 20-30 minute . There security rule respect order avoid accident due metal attract machine 's strong magnetic field . No side effect associate muscle strength measurement Dynamometer . However , weak patient may bite tired examination , perform movement use force . Statistics Comparison baseline visit perform use conventional statistic method unpaired t-test non-parametric test Wilcoxon signed-rank test . In variation analysis several group ANOVA ANCOVA use . A significant difference p-values 0.05 determine , determine validity finding . With significant level 5 % power calculation estimate needed sample size 14 patient , power 90 % . The calculation base expect decrease muscle volume compare fat ( 1.2 vs 0.95 standard deviation 0.2 ) . The power calculation estimate , compare similar studyxiii sample size include extra 3 subject . Given rare condition PD , inclusion patient continue even require minimum achieve . The statistic calculation use patient Dystrophia Myotonica , include study great similarity Pompe Disease . Perspectives If MRI image sensitive method high specificity assessment muscle quality myopathy , technique may use diagnosis continuous validation proper treatment patient Pompe disease relate muscular disease . Clinical trial : Day one . Patients Pompe Disease Dystrophia Myotonica The patient come neurological department Aarhus University Hospital Nørrebrogade . Their muscle-strength measure Dynamometer ; measurement take approximately 2 hour . In addition , Pompe patient undergo 6 min walk test , vital capacity negative inspiration/expiration test , sit-to-stand test well structured neurological examination . This take 1 hour . After first part examination , patient drive , hospital minibus , MR center Skejby University Hospital , MR-scanning do . The total timeframe scanning , include change clothes , information scanning , take 1,5 hour . In case it´s possible make physical examination scan day , scan take place another day , within follow 7 working day . Healthy control The control subject receive neurological department Aarhus University Hospital Nørrebrogade . Their muscle-strength measure Dynamometer ; measurement take approximately 2 hour . Afterwards , drive , hospital minibus , MR center Skejby University Hospital , MR-scanning perform . The total time scanning , include change clothes , information scanning , take 1,5 hour . In case it´s possible perform physical examination scan day , scan take place another day , within follow 7 working day . Clinical trial : day 2 After 8 month , patient Pompe disease come new investigation . The examination , describe , perform .</detailed_description>
