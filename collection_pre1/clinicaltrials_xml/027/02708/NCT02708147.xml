	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate recovery child bronchiolitis without physical therapy treatment . The experimental group receive educational information 5 session physiotherapy protocol , home physical therapy office . The control group evaluate . For experimental control group lung sound record Wang 's respiratory severity scale calculate initially 3th , 5th 21st day computorized . After 3 month initial contact , interview phone relapse clinical sign bronchiolitis . It expect child receive physiotherapy well recovery control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Respiratory Physiotherapy Children With Bronchiolitis First Two Years Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due different opinion literature relevance respiratory physiotherapy treatment bronchiolitis , urgent need conduct study robust methodology explore impact physical therapy child bronchiolitis , especially non-hospitalized , consider different level severity bronchiolitis . This study aim evaluate recovery child bronchiolitis without physical therapy treatment primarily computerize respiratory sound . As secondary goal secondary measure register evaluate compare treatment , duration frequency bronchiolitis 3 month diagnosis . The plan recruit approximately 52 child ( age 2 ) 1st 2nd bronchiolitis diagnostic pediatrician . Then , researcher contact legal representative participant provide detailed information obtain consent form . Patients randomly assign conventional treatment group conventional treatment plus respiratory physiotherapy group . The experimental group receive 5 physiotherapy session home physical therapy office . The respiratory technique follow flowchart wich begin saline instillation nose nasopharyngeal clean technique . Then clear lung slow inspiratory slow force expiratory technique use . The application vibration also include flowchart . During session , educational information also provide . The baseline evaluation include sociodemographic , anthropometric clinical data , calculation Wang 's score well computerized lung auscultation . The lung sound recorded 7 anatomic region : trachea ( sternum node ) leave right anterior region ( middle clavicular line 2nd intercostal space ) , leave right lateral region ( axillary line 4th / 5th intercostal space ) , leave right back region ( 5 cm para-vertebral line 7 cm inferior angle scapular ) approximately 20 second . With exception sample characterization data retrieve first evaluation , measure take place remain three evaluation ( 3th , 5th 21st day ) . The experimental group still final evaluation ( auscultation , vital sign Wang scale ) end treatment session . A follow-up evaluation take place 3 month phone interview regard question recurrence bronchiolitis , well current presence symptom cough , sore throat , nasal obstruction , respiratory noise , difficulty sleep feed At end study expect good result experimental group , base robust methodology impact respiratory therapy child 0 2 year , treatment bronchiolitis order justify intervention physiotherapy area generate recommendation clinical practice .</detailed_description>
