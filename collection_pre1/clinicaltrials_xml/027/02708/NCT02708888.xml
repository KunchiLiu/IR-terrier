	<brief_summary>The aim study explore effect additional customized trunk exercise clinical biomechanical gait performance . Despite evidence demonstrate importance trunk control stroke , study effect trunk rehabilitation gait performance inconsistent . The finding study might lead new scientific insight importance trunk gait rehabilitation people suffer stroke submit rehabilitation hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Additional Trunk Exercises Gait Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To examine effect additional trunk exercise gait performance via clinical biomechanical assessment patient receive inpatient rehabilitation stroke . Design : The design study assessor-blinded randomize controlled trial . Prior evaluation , participant randomly allocate either experimental control group mean conceal envelope . The number patient require study calculated priori ensure sufficient statistical power . Analysis show sample size 30 patient group necessary detect difference ( ES1 ) 80 % use two-tailed hypothesis ( significance p=0.05 ) . Intervention : All patient receive multidisciplinary conventional stroke rehabilitation program provide rehabilitation staff . The control group receive series cognitive exercise focus aspect memory ( visual , auditory , work memory ) , attention ( sustained attention selective attention ) , executive functioning ( plan problem-solving ) . The additional training trunk train group focus trunk muscle strength , coordination selective movement . The training program consist task-specific movement upper low part trunk supine sit position stable unstable surface ( physio ball ) . The following trunk exercise perform : bridging , reach , lower/upper trunk rotation , lower/upper trunk lateral flexion , upper/lower trunk flexion , ... Outcome measure : 1 . Tinetti Test 2 . Gait parameter record 3D-Full body gait analysis : Gait analysis perform M²OCEAN movement analysis laboratory ( Multidisciplinary Motor Centre Antwerp , University Antwerp , Antwerp , Edegem ) . VICON analysis system ( ©Vicon Motion Systems Ltd. , London , UK ) golden standard 3D motion analysis . Eight infrared automate camera ( Vicon T10 camera , 100 fps , 1 Megapixel ) measure 3D coordinate reflective motion tracker . Two video camera record walk pattern participant sagittal frontal plane . In addition , initial contact toe measure base ankle trajectory reflective marker together 3 AMTI type OR 6-7 force plate ( 1000 fps , 46x50x8 cm ) 1 AccuGait® ( 1000 fps ) force plate recording . Subsequently , movement analysis lab equip 16 channel telemetric wireless electromyographic ( EMG ) system ( Arion Zerowire ) measure muscle activity . Recordings analyse use Vicon Nexus 1.8.5. software . Step time parameter gait kinematics filter ( Butterworth filter ) process Matlab® ( The MathWorks , Inc. , Natick , Massachusetts , U.S.A. ) . 3 . Trunk Impairment Scale , Barthel Index Follow-up . One month post intervention patient subject clinical biomechanical assessment measure sustainability trunk exercise time .</detailed_description>
