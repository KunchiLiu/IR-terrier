	<detailed_description>Inguinal hernia repair one common surgery perform general surgeon world . Tension-free Lichtenstein repair common technique use open repair , many surgeon perform laparoscopic hernia repair : total extraperitoneal repair ( TEP ) transabdominal preperitoneal repair ( TAPP ) . Laparoscopic surgery consider reduce postoperative pain , incidence wound complication time return activity daily live . Both technique base principle tension free repair rely mesh placement preperitoneal space exclude inguinal defect reinforce abdominal wall ; recurrence rate follow tension-free hernia repair report low range 1-4 % . Chronic pain inguinal hernia repair well recognize complication , irrespective technique . The incidence chronic pain estimate around 5-10 % . Many factor contribute development chronic pain , one factor type mesh fixation method . Common type mesh fixation method laparoscopic hernia repair traumatic fixation - use tack ( absorbable non-absorbable ) atraumatic fixation , e.g . use fibrin glue ; surgeon fix mesh . No fixation practice surgeon unilateral repair study show difference recurrence rate incidence chronic pain fixation fixation group , yet study hernia open small ( &lt; 3cm ) measure . It generally agree fixation indicate large hernia ( defect size &gt; 3cm ) , bilateral hernia recurrent hernia order avoid early mesh dislocation hernia recurrence . Study show use tack cause early postoperative pain . Manufacturers try develop self-gripping mesh aim reduce chronic pain . ProgripTM ( Covidien ) lightweight , self-gripping mesh compose monofilament polyester polylactic acid ( PLA ) microgrips indicate inguinal hernia repair . The resorbable microgrips provide immediate adherence surround muscle adipose tissue hernia surgery , result fixation method require . Studies show ProgripTM associate less pain early recovery period use open Lichtenstein repair , yet study ProgripTM laparoscopic hernia repair . In Hong Kong , TEP prefer approach surgeon perform laparoscopic hernia surgery . In trial , patient inguinal hernia suitable TEP recruit . TEP perform usual manner . Surgeon assess size hernia defect prior mesh insertion . For patient large hernia defect bilateral inguinal hernia require mesh fixation , randomize two group : ProgripTM non-ProgripTM group . For ProgripTM addition fixation necessary , non-ProgripTM fixation indicate . As tack know associated postoperative pain , fibrin glue designate fixation method non- ProgripTM group study .</detailed_description>
