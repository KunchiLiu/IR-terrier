	<detailed_description>Inflammatory disease paranasal sinuses occupy one lead position overall structure ENT-diseases . Puncture method conventional approach treatment suppurative maxillary sinusitis Russia present . However , relatively simple conventional treatment method number disadvantage . Fear unpleasant procedure justify . Generally , single puncture ensure healing , doctor install drainage perform repeat manipulation significantly reduce quality life disease period . There also certain risk puncture needle penetration adjacent area . Sometimes direct contraindication puncture exist ( intolerance topical anesthetic , blood clotting disorder , etc. ) . The puncture , independent method , relieve procedure rather pathognomonic treatment method , especially regard severe combine form sinusitis risk intracranial complication . Due lack standardized antibacterial drug inject sinus , multiple puncture erroneously consider able eliminate bacterial agent successfully . One promise trend regard treatment suppurative maxillary sinusitis adequate antibacterial therapy . Fluoroquinolones last generation , levofloxacin particular , highly active pneumococcus , effective vs. generation II drug intracellular agent ( Chlamydia spp. , Mycoplasma spp. , M.tuberculosis , rapidly grow atypical mycobacteria ( M.avium , etc. ) . At activity towards gram-negative bacteria reduce . An important property drug consist activity regard number bacteria resistant generation II fluoroquinolones . Due high activity agent upper low respiratory bacterial infection sometimes call `` respiratory '' fluoroquinolones . According publication , Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d . 5 day eliminate radiological sign disease end course 65 % subject , 35 % show positive change ( лю.лљ . Panyakina , 2012 ) . Based finding , otolaryngologist obtain higher therapeutic efficacy level 5-day course , since treatment term demonstrate violate compliance frequently . One option elevation daily dose . In particular , Rameez Shah ( 2013 ) publish data concern high efficacy levofloxacin daily dose 750 mg 5 day . Necessity search way shorten current course antibiotic therapy discussion level . Particularly , 24th European Congress Clinical Microbiology Infectious Diseases perform May 10-13 , 2014 Barcelona ( ECCMID 2014 ) repeatedly raise question concern revision current treatment standard clinical recommendation concern duration antibiotic therapy dose regimen . Based above-mentioned finding , would interest evaluate efficacy various antibiotic scheme ( respiratory fluoroquinolones protect aminopenicillin ) hospital condition .</detailed_description>
