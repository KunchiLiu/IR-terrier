	<brief_summary>Background : Infiltration GI T lymphocytes pathogenic mechanism ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . Vedolizumab ( VDZ ) humanize monoclonal antibody bind high affinity α4β7 integrin block α4β7+-MAdCAM-1 interaction , hence block key step GI lymphocytes T infiltration . VDZ demonstrate therapeutic effect UC CD . Investigators still lack adequate biomarkers predict clinical response biological treatment , specially avoid invasive procedure . Objective : Study whether circulate CD4+ CD8+ α4β7+ memory T lymphocytes surface marker might molecular marker response VDZ treatment patient UC CD . Methods : Prospective ( pilot ) study include 24 adult IBD patient ( 12 UC patient 12 CD patient ( patient fistulizing perianal disease exclude ) active disease prior failure anti-TNFα treatment start treatment VDZ . They receive VDZ standard induction ( 300mg intravenously , 0-2-6 week ) maintenance scheme ( 300mg intravenously , every 8 week ) . Epidemiological clinical data every patient record prospectively . Disease activity week 0 , 2 , 6 14 week evaluate validated clinical score , biological parameter fecal biomarkers . At week 14 response treatment evaluate ileocolonoscopy enteroMRI . Peripheral blood obtain every patient baseline , third infusion VDZ ( 6th week ) first maintenance dose ( 14th week ) . Blood lymphocytes isolated multicolor flow cytometry perform stored circulate memory T cell . Percentage absolute value circulate CD4+ CD8+ α4β7+ memory T lymphocytes well several surface marker related activation state ( HLA-DR , CD25 ) , Th17 phenotype ( IL23R , CCR6 , intracellular IL17A ) Th1 phenotype ( INFγ ) assess α4β7+ memory T cell .</brief_summary>
