	<brief_summary>Liver transplantation sole therapy end-stage liver diseases acute liver failure child adult . However , use life-saving technique limit due severe shortage donor liver . The number transplant currently perform approximately one-third number need accommodate 16,000 patient await organ US . Over 20 % patient liver transplant wait list die prior transplantation due organ shortage . The median waiting time 2011 300 day . Poor immediate graft function primary non function ( PNF ) clinically significant event , especially recipients marginal liver ( elderly donor , extend cold storage time , steatosis ) . PNF dramatic effect patient morbidity mortality , necessitate prolonged expensive stay intensive care unit , re-transplantation life-saving therapy patient fail liver graft due PNF . This exert great burden already scarce donor organ pool . Furthermore , biliary stricture ischemic cholangiopathy , result severe ischemia reperfusion injury , cause prolong hospital stay , long-term complication , increased cost . Targeted treatment , one propose application , reduce need re-transplantation , reduce biliary injury , potentially increase number donor organ available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Liver transplantation sole therapy end-stage liver diseases child adult . However , use life-saving technique limit due severe shortage donor liver , consequently , 1500 patients/year wait list die prior transplantation due organ shortage . Also , poor immediate graft function remain persistent problem especially recipients marginal liver , biliary stricture evolve reperfusion injury cause prolong hospital stay , increase health care cost , increase mortality . Furthermore , hepatic cold storage reperfusion transplantation setting cause mitochondrial dysfunction liver cell , constitute great risk primary nonfunction initial poor function liver transplantation . The tetracycline derivative minocycline safe widely use antibiotic posse cytoprotective effect prevention mitochondrial dysfunction variety disease model . Recently , show minocycline also protect graft dysfunction failure orthotopic rat liver transplantation cell death ischemia-reperfusion culture rat hepatocytes . Minocycline treatment specifically prevent mitochondrial dysfunction increase graft animal survival block necrotic apoptotic death pathway . Clinical study indicate severe deterioration mitochondrial function liver preservation provide strong impetus investigate minocycline effective agent decrease injury improve graft function human clinical transplantation .</detailed_description>
