	<criteria>Subject must 18 year age old Subject must willing give write informed consent Subject must diagnose ventral abdominal incisional hernia Subject must willing undergo laparoscopic hernia repair use intraabdominal placement ( without Component Separation Technique ( CST ) ) Surgeon must able fully close hernia defect . Defect closure define complete reapproximation fascial edge , leave gap . Since safety effectiveness Phasix™ ST Mesh bridge repair evaluate establish , defect close prior mesh use .
