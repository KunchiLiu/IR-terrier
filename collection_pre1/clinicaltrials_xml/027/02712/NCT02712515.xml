	<brief_summary>Essential tremor ( ET ) among common movement disorder , prevalent tremor disorder . It progressive , degenerative brain disorder result increasingly debilitate tremor , afflict estimate 7 million people US ( 2.2 % population ) estimate population study worldwide range 0.4 % 6.3 % . ET directly link progressive functional impairment , social embarrassment , even depression . Intention ( kinetic ) tremor arm occur approximately half ET patient , typically slow tremor ( ~5-10Hz ) occur end purposeful movement , insidiously progressive many year . Based direct indirect neurophysiological study , suggest pathological synchronous oscillation neuronal network involve ventral intermediate nucleus ( Vim ) thalamus , premotor ( PM ) , primary motor ( M1 ) cortex , cerebellum , may result production ET . In spite numerous therapeutic modality available , 65 % suffer upper limb tremor report serious difficulty daily life . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) emerge effective treatment option suffer medically refractory ET . The accepted target ET DBS therapy Vim thalamus . Vim project PM , M1 , supplementary motor area ( SMA ) receive afferent ipsilateral cerebellum . Moreover , electrophysiological recording Vim stereotactic surgery identify `` tremor cell '' synchronously discharge oscillatory muscle activity tremor . Clinical computational finding indicate DBS suppresses tremor mask `` burst driver '' input thalamus . The overall goal investigate neural signature tremor generation thalamocortical network record data DBS implantation surgery . Investigators record data macroelectrode implant Vim DBS therapy , additional 6-contact subdural cortical strip place hand motor cortical area temporarily burr hole open implantation DBS electrode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Motor Network Essential Tremor : Mechanisms Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research study goal advance understanding mechanisms essential tremor brain recording . The investigator collect brain signal person essential tremor undergo neurosurgical treatment ( deep brain stimulation implantation ) . By record implanted electrode deep brain stimulation along two non-invasive intraoperative monitoring electrode , origins tremor study human motor network . Moreover , perform recording deep brain stimulation delivery , mechanism deep brain stimulation modulate network suppress tremor investigate . During standard care DBS procedure neural recording perform participant recline position operate table . In addition neural recording standard ask patient move arm legs procedure . An additional intraoperative monitoring subdural electrode strip , use epilepsy tumor surgery perform functional mapping , place neurosurgeon DBS electrode place per clinical need patient . In addition , Ad-Tech Medical Instrumentation Corp. device use test response wireless sensor place participant 's arm , record EMG activity . Brain signal record use clinical FHC Guideline 4000+ system , capable record stimulation . This additional testing add approximately 30-45 minute surgical time .</detailed_description>
