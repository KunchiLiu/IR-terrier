	<brief_title>Evaluation Prolonged Apnea Supported High Frequency Non-invasive Ventilation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High frequency ventilation ( HF-V ) allow ensure oxygen delivery carbon dioxide clearance despite absence thoracic movement anesthetize , invasively ventilated subject . This technique could apply non-invasive interface ( HF-NIV ) , allow obtain prolonged apnea ( absence thoraco-abdominal respiratory movement ) awaken subject . Such application would interest several clinical application , e.g . lung image radio-therapy treatment lung cancer . The purpose study assess effect different HF-NIV setting apnea duration , carbon dioxide clearance oxygen delivery healthy subjets patient lung disease .</detailed_description>
