	<brief_summary>For asthmatic subject , combination inhale corticosteroid ( FF ) long-acting beta2 receptor agonist ( VI ) recommend use ( daily ) fraction exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) non-invasive airway inflammation marker . In randomised , double blind , placebo-controlled , two-period , crossover repeat dose study , duration action fluticasone furoate ( FF ) determine monitor return FeNO level baseline , follow treatment FF/vilanetrol ( VI ) asthmatic subject . Subjects meet eligibility criterion participate follow two treatment period : FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily placebo once-daily . Approximately 28 subject enrol order achieve 24 evaluable subject . A 2-week treatment period follow 21-day monitoring/washout period cross next treatment period . Total duration subject maximum 21 week . FeNO monitor 21 day treatment FF/VI together FEV1 ( 7 day ) .</brief_summary>
