	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate clinical algorithm diagnosis treatment provoke vestibulodynia ( PVD ) . The algorithm , distinguish four subtypes PVD : hormonally mediate PVD , hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction , congenital neuroproliferative PVD acquire neuroproliferative PVD , base patient 's history physical exam . The study follow patient diagnose PVD , one year , evaluate treatment outcome different subgroup . Investigators hope conduct prospective study , show clinical benefit improve outcome patient classify accord method may change common practice `` trial error '' base treatment , improve clinical result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Provoked vestibulodynia ( PVD ) term describe syndrome provoke , localize allodynia vestibule vulva , explain another condition , last 3 month . PVD define disease rather symptom . It think PVD represent group distinct disorder classify together produce pain anatomic location . Causes disorder include hormonal imbalance , mainly cause hormonal contraception , nerve fiber proliferation vestibular mucosa hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction . PVD may appear sexual debut first attempt insert tampon ( primary PVD ) new onset pain activity previously illicit pain ( secondary PVD ) . Studies find different factor genetic , inflammatory mediator , recurrent vaginitis , allergy trauma may involve development PVD . A high percentage patient vulvar pain report antecedent history vulvovaginal candida infection , although unknown represent true increase incidence misdiagnosis . It suggest repeated vulvovaginal infection trigger event woman lead chronic vulvar pain . This observation lead hypothesis patient neurogenic vulnerability , initiate event series event may lead chronic vulvar pain . Treatment vulvodynia generally predicate trial error basis , pathogenesis define . The result many form therapeutic intervention use , yet evidence remain largely inconclusive , response rate varies 40-85 % , many woman respond treatment . Unfavorable outcome therapy explain group patient different condition one diagnosis , study intervention might help one subset condition . This lead apparent lack effect , due dilution patient subpopulation . A different approach diagnosis treatment PVD suggest Dr. Andrew Goldstein . He classify PVD group , base history examination finding : 1 . Hormonally mediate PVD - The pain begin take hormonal contraceptive medication affect hormone , removal ovary , breastfeed menopause . Typically , patient low calculate free testosterone complain dryness decrease libido . The entire vestibule tender vestibular mucosa often dry thin . Treatment include stop hormonal contraception application topical estradiol testosterone vestibule . 2 . Hypertonic pelvic muscle dysfunction - In subgroup , pelvic floor ( PF ) muscle become tight tender . Patients often symptoms suggest hypertonicity ( urinary frequency , urgency hesitancy , constipation , hemorrhoid anal fissure ) , predispose factor , musculoskeletal disorder anxiety may coexist . Typically , pain much bad 4-8 o'clock position vestibule minimal pain upper vestibule . Treatment include PF physiotherapy , optional addition muscle relaxant ( valium suppository Botulinum toxin injection ) . 3 . Neuroproliferative PVD- In condition , woman increase number nociceptors vestibular mucosa . This group subdivide congenital acquire form . In congenital subgroup , vestibular pain always present , may sensitivity palpation belly button ( evidence congenital neuronal hyperplasia within tissue derive urogenital sinus ) . With acquired neuroproliferative PVD , pain may begin severe allergic reaction vaginitis . There tenderness entire vestibule . Treatments include topical anaesthetic , antidepressant , antiseizure drug , capsaicin cream vulvar vestibulectomy . Goldstein 's diagnostic algorithm claim allow differentiation different cause PVD . In , appropriate treatment subgroup select , success rate exceed report success rate PVD treatment study . Although investigator good personal experience method , algorithm evidence base . Objectives : The propose study prospective , cohort-based study , evaluate characteristic PVD-subgroups accord Goldstein 's algorithm , patient ' response treatment outcome . General aim : Define whether woman diagnose accord Goldstein 's algorithm experience high rate favorable outcome comparison report literature . This allow u study effectiveness classification well define subgroup . Specific aim : 1 . Describe population woman PVD attend clinic , distribution criterion characteristic woman category . 2 . Follow woman diagnose accord algorithm one year define treatment success . Methods The propose study prospective , cohort-based study . Patients recruit clinic vulvovaginal disorder Clalit Healthcare service Jerusalem . The diagnostic procedure , patient ' sub-classification propose treatment current protocol identical currently use clinic . Patients fulfill diagnostic criterion PVD willing participate study ask sign inform consent complete self-administered intake questionnaire request data PVD condition severity , various parameter quality life ( QOL ) , general health , Ob\Gyn history , sexual function , psychometric characteristic ( anxiety , depression etc ) demographic . After complete questionnaire , patient undergo standard evaluation , diagnose accord Goldstein 's algorithm . Instructions treatment give regard diagnosis . Patients instructed schedule follow-up appointment 3,6,9 , 12 month . During follow-up appointment assess regard vestibular tenderness use various parameter , well questionnaires QOL sexual function .</detailed_description>
