	<detailed_description>The central aim project characterize expression exosomal microRNA ( miRNA ) child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Currently , CDC estimate prevalence ASD U.S. child 1 68 . Yet , biological cause , diagnosis , treatment disease remain ambiguous . Growing evidence implicates genetic role ASD . miRNAs regulate genetic expression alter lymphocyte , neuron serum patient ASD . Recent study miRNAs show package exosomal vessel extrude neuron extracellular signaling tool . This knowledge provide novel approach examine genetic regulation central nervous system . We propose measure expression extracellular miRNA child ASD . Expression level miRNA blood saliva compare child autism normally develop control . The goal study identify genetic regulatory mechanism involve ASD provide potential biomarkers diagnostic screening . The primary endpoint study follow : 1 . Characterization brain-related miRNA saliva child ASD typically develop control child age two five year . 2 . Identification set miRNAs saliva plasma predictive ASD diagnosis severity ASD symptom . This aim enroll ASD control child age 12-24 month ( inclusive ) . Secondary endpoint include identification miRNA expression pattern correlate ASD symptom severity measure standardized neuropsychologic test characterize parental knowledge attitude towards epigenetic test context ASD..</detailed_description>
