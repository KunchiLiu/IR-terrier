	<detailed_description>Gilbert syndrome mild genetic liver disorder body properly process bilirubin , yellowish waste product form old worn red blood cell break ( hemolysis ) . Individuals Gilbert syndrome elevate level bilirubin ( hyperbilirubinemia ) , reduce level specific liver enzyme require elimination bilirubin . Most affected individual symptom ( asymptomatic ) may exhibit mild yellow skin , mucous membrane , white eye ( jaundice ) . Jaundice may apparent adolescence . Bilirubin level may increase follow stress , exertion , dehydration alcohol consumption , fasting , and/or infection . In individual , jaundice may apparent trigger one condition . Gilbert syndrome inherit autosomal recessive trait . Although Gilbert syndrome may become apparent shortly birth , may recognize many year . Episodes mild jaundice may appear young adult common male female . Frequently , episode jaundice overlook . Gilbert syndrome associate fluctuating level bilirubin blood ( hyperbilirubinemia ) . Bilirubin level may increase stress , strain , dehydration , fasting , infection exposure cold . In many individual , jaundice evident one trigger raise bilirubin level . Some affected individual report vague , unspecific symptom include fatigue , weakness gastrointestinal symptom nausea , abdominal discomfort , diarrhea . Gilbert syndrome inherit autosomal recessive trait . Genetic disease determine combination gene particular trait chromosome receive father mother . Gilbert syndrome cause mutation UGT1A1 gene locate long arm ( q ) chromosome 2 ( 2q37 ) . Chromosomes , present nucleus human cell , carry genetic information individual . The UGT1A1 gene contains instruction create ( encode ) liver enzyme know uridine disphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) . This enzyme require conversion ( conjugation ) subsequent excretion bilirubin body . Mild jaundice associate Gilbert syndrome occurs due reduce amount enzyme , result accumulation unconjugated bilirubin body . Bilirubin orange-yellow bile pigment mainly byproduct natural breakdown ( degeneration ) red blood cell ( hemolysis ) . Bilirubin circulate liquid portion blood ( plasma ) bound protein call albumin ; call unconjugated bilirubin , dissolve water ( water-insoluble ) . Normally , unconjugated bilirubin take liver cell , help UGT1A1 enzyme , convert form water-soluble bilirubin glucuronides ( conjugate bilirubin ) , excrete bile . The bile store gall bladder , call upon , pass common bile duct upper portion small intestine ( duodenum ) aid digestion . Most bilirubin eliminate body feces . Individuals Gilbert syndrome retain approximately one third normal UGT1A1 enzyme activity able conjugate enough bilirubin prevent symptom develop . However , case , especially affected individual fasting , dehydrate feeling well , mild jaundice may develop . Gilbert syndrome diagnose often males female . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
