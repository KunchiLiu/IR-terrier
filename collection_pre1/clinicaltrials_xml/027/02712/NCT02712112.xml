	<brief_summary>Recent preclinical study suggest potential possibility imatinib might promote tumor growth presence secondary resistance mutation [ 10 ] . This result imply intermittent dose schedule imatinib rechallenge might well continuous dose schedule term control tumor harbor secondary resistance mutation . In addition , heavily pretreated patient , even mild grade toxicity may significantly impair quality life , intermittent dose schedule may advantage context . Therefore , investigator hypothesize intermittent dosing schedule imatinib rechallenge might feasible effective patient TKI-refractory GISTs . This study assess feasibility intermittent imatinib dose schedule patient GISTs failure imatinib sunitinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Intermittent Dosing Schedule Imatinib Patients With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Refractory GISTs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomly assign imatinib arm either intermittent continuous dose schedule ratio 1:1 use computer-based system . Imatinib administer dose 400 mg/day , day food , form 100-mg tablet . Patients assign continuous dose arm receive imatinib without off-schedule , assign intermittent dose arm receive imatinib one-week on/one-week dosing schedule . Four week study treatment consider one cycle continuous intermittent dose schedule . In arm , imatinib treatment beyond multiple progression define RECIST version 1.1 permit , unless treat physician decide clinical benefit imatinib . Imatinib discontinue unacceptable toxicity patient 's withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
