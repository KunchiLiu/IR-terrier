	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND - Approximately 1,700 transient ischaemic attack ( TIAs ) occur annually NI TIA survivor often leave considerable functional impairment . TIA stroke share common risk factor cardiovascular disease . Cardiac rehabilitation post-myocardial infarction show significant reduction morbidity mortality , home-based programme produce good adherence similar outcome hospital-and community-based programme . However , value rehabilitation programme stroke prevention follow TIA minor stroke unclear . AIMS - determine novel rehabilitation programme , 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' , TIA/minor stroke patient develop , use MRC guideline develop complex health service intervention , approve home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme ( 'Heart Manual ' ) pilot 12-week trial novel programme . METHODS-All patient attend TIA clinic Belfast within 4 week first TIA/mild stroke invite participate . The novel home-based programme manual develop follow systematic review literature qualitative exploration target population , use focus group . A feasibility study develop pilot trial . The pilot trial recruit 3 different treatment : ( 1 ) standard care ; ( 2 ) standard care plus manual ; ( 3 ) standard care , manual plus pedometer ( promote physical activity ) . Interviews focus group employ assess intervention ' acceptability . The intervention , 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' refine modified stage research . CONCLUSIONS - The finding inform development novel secondary prevention programme , 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' , TIA/minor stroke patient trial test effectiveness longer-term potential improve outcome TIA/stroke patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPRITE - A Feasibility Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODS - The development novel home-based rehabilitation programme , adapt `` Heart Manual '' , follow guideline MRC develop complex health service intervention . The step guideline include : 1 ) explore relevant theory ; 2 ) model preliminary intervention select main component base literature qualitative research ; 3 ) pilot-testing preliminary intervention ; 4 ) develop definitive randomise controlled trial ; , 5 ) implement evaluate randomise controlled trial long-term . This study focus first three step MRC framework . Exploration relevant theory - Initially , literature relate cardiac rehabilitation secondary prevention TIAs minor stroke review follow search appropriate database input medical librarian . The research team ( include applicant , supervisor , collaborator steer group ) discuss key finding identify deem appropriate study setting , identification appropriate behaviour change theory use behaviour change taxonomy . Recruitment : Participants recruit two TIA/ 'minor ' stroke assessment unit , base Belfast , Royal Victoria Hospital Ulster Hospital . Patients typically see within one week suffer neurological symptom suggestive TIA . After confirmation diagnosis initial management day presentation , attend physician offer patient study information sheet invitation participate . If patient agrees contact , researcher telephone twenty-four hour later invite attend Clinical Research Facility , QUB participate study write , informed consent obtain . The number decline participate study record provide information recruitment rate . Developing intervention : From agree participate , initial purposeful sample patient invited focus group . Participants give manual approximately week focus group ask read attend focus group . The topic guide focus group base finding literature review include format lay-out manual , manual content potential improvement manual . Health social care staff involve clinical care TIA stroke patient , member voluntary organisation , relatives carers also invite participate focus group : initial plan sample individual would invite single group . Participants ' professional ' experience attitude towards key intervention identify literature also use model pilot intervention . With participant 's consent , interview focus group audio-recorded transcribed . Two researcher analyse transcript independently : familiarisation ; identify thematic framework ; indexing ; charting ; , map interpretation . Feasibility pilot study intervention - Baseline assessment : Following analysis finding literature review qualitative data , home-based vascular rehabilitation manual develop , adapt `` Heart Manual '' ( refer 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' ) accordingly . This novel manual pilot phase II clinical trial use outcome measure predict VO2max . As described , prospective trial participant invite attend Clinical Research Facility within 2 week initial TIA/'minor ' stroke event , initial assessment , write consent participate seek . Baseline assessment ( take approximately 60 minute ) complete prior randomisation ensure allocation concealment . All patient initially undertake submaximal exercise test supervision train physician exclude contra- indication exercise provide predict VO2max . All give , appropriate instruction , Actigraph GT3x accelerometer wear one week provide blind baseline physical activity assessment . Participants give stamp addressed envelope return accelerometer post applicant one week . Randomisation : Block randomisation use patient stratify , base age , sex diagnosis ( TIA/'minor ' stroke ) . Study group allocation reveal participant end baseline assessment follow completion initial measurement ( except accelerometry ) . Interventions : The control group ( Group 1 ) follow standard care guideline per treatment protocol provide healthcare professional hospital clinic . Group 2 receive home-based 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' well standard care ( propose duration six week ) ; whilst Group 3 additionally receive pedometer well 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' standard care . 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' programme explain Group 2 3 participant applicant end baseline assessment . The use pedometer , approach use goal set accompany diary also explain Group 3 participant time . 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' address modifiable vascular risk factor , manage one risk factor week , whilst encourage patient slowly increase activity ( propose ) six week programme set home address issue anxiety depression follow diagnosis TIA 'minor ' stroke . The manual therefore involve education motivation patient address risk factor . The facilitator ( applicant and/or stroke nurse ) also help identify local support resource , example smoking cessation service . 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' utilise behaviour change technique goal setting , barrier identification , set graded task , self monitoring , feedback , relapse prevention stress management . Self-set pedometer target emerge discussion applicant use simple motivational interviewing technique advise keep daily step-count diary . Telephone follow-up review , applicant , take place one four week per usual `` Heart Manual '' care well eight week three group , unless finding initial qualitative work would suggest alternative design follow-up plan would appropriate . These review include advice regard address modifiable vascular risk factor , appropriate , issue home-based vascular rehabilitation programme ( 'The Healthy Brain Manual ' ) pedometer target . Review assessment : All participant 3 month follow-up review appointment research nurse , keep blind random group allocation . This review take approximately sixty minute complete : nurse administer questionnaires self-completion repeat baseline measurement except submaximal exercise test ( assessment predict VO2max ) conduct trained physician . All participant ask wear Actigraph GT3x accelerometer , one week , provide post-intervention physical activity assessment return post way follow baseline assessment . End-of study qualitative assessment : At end pilot study , participant ask perception relevance , acceptability value intervention , use questionnaire , focus group semi structure interview . The manual developed stage research process per MRC guideline .</detailed_description>
