	<brief_title>`` Binaural Beats '' Non-drug Premedication Elderly Major Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Need surgery increase among elderly population , increase average life expectancy improve surgical anesthetic technique . A big problem kind patient high incidence delirium cognitive impairment post-operative period , increase age , depend type intervention ( especially Orthopaedics Cardiac Surgery ) administration agent , particularly sedatives opioids . Premedication usually carry use anxiolytic / narcotic drug order reduce anxiety discomfort relate intervention anesthesia . The preoperative anxiety fact increase demand intra post operative anesthetic analgesic contribute increase post operative pain . For reason use pharmacological premedication controversial elderly patient , risk side effect drug one side , discomfort result increase level anxiety absence premedication . . Some recent surgical guideline warn premedication drug patient sixty-five , consider occurrence delirium cognitive impairment may worsen prognosis , limit use drug strictly necessary immediacy surgical act . To reduce level anxiety without use medication , author use `` Binaural Beats '' . This simple technique , describe first time since Gerald Oster , include presentation two acoustic stimulus similar frequency two channel stereo headphone . The interference wave occurs level central nervous system , produce composite signal frequency result difference two original frequency . For example give acoustic stimulus 100 Hz ear simultaneously administer another acoustic stimulation 104 Hz opposite , ear person listens stimuli perceive `` Binaural Beat '' 4 Hz cause difference two frequency . These Binaural Beats interest thought cause hemispheric synchronization influence EEG frequency like light stimulation . The frequency 4 Hz ( delta-Tetha rhythm ) consider favor state calm relaxation . Binaural Beats already use human undergoing outpatient surgery uro-gynecological show help increase patient comfort reduce state anxiety pain without interfere negatively postoperative functional recovery . The level preoperative anxiety assess administer different tool .The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , widely use tool literature , handle reliability result . We expect administration listen session binaural beat 4 Hz frequency , possible effect relaxation result reduction level anxiety measure STAI scale , would result significant difference average value submit subject treatment control subject .</detailed_description>
