	<brief_summary>Intracranial aneurysm ( IA ) asymptomatic cerebrovascular abnormality affect 3.2 % general population . The devastate complication IA rupture , result subarachnoid haemorrhage lead severe disability death . Unfortunately , neither reliable clue diagnostic tool predict formation and/or fate IA give individual . Also , pharmacological drug available prevent rupture aneurysm subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhage . Current treatment invasive significant risk procedural morbidity . Thus , still , management patient IA remain extremely challenging still controversial . Although pathogenesis IA subject many study last decade , mechanism underlie IA formation , growth rupture still mostly unknown relevant animal model IA available . Familial history IA predispose IA formation rupture increase evidence suggest genetic component IA formation , heterogeneous mode inheritance penetrance . This project , gather neuroradiologists , geneticist vascular biologist , address urgent need understand pathogenic mechanism IA develop diagnostic predictive tool risk IA . The investigator propose identify IA-causing variant whole-exome sequence familial form disease . The investigator hypothesise functional analysis causal/susceptibility variant thus identify provide clue understand pathological mechanism IA formation , base develop diagnostic tool . This project aim meeting challenge . Based preliminary data already allow identify variant , combination genetic functional investigation , specific objective project : - To identify IA-causing variant familial form disease whole-exome sequencing ; - To understand function genes/variants formation rupture IA molecular cellular approach generation relevant animal model ; - To discover potential biomarkers risk IA formation and/or rupture .</brief_summary>
