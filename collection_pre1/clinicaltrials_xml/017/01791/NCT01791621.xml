	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) sufferer often find specific food exacerbate symptom ; identify food involve long arduous process . Different food allergy test market IBS sufferer healthcare practitioner easy way identify offend food . Which test method might best use ? This project compare result different food allergy method versus elimination/challenge diet determine method maybe superior IBS sufferer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Diagnostic Predictability Food Allergy Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A variety method available assess food item individual IBS may tolerate well . No study compare predictability method result Elimination/Challenge ( E/C ) diet individual suffer IBS , assess method might accurately identify Non Immune Mediated Food Allergies ( NIMFAs ) IBS suffers ' An understanding relative agreement test may help patient practitioner make good decision around best investigate NIMFAs IBS inform design large study topic . The primary objective study determine ability different laboratory method food test ( IgG titre , Cytotoxic assay electrodermal screen method ) food reactivity predict food individual IBS reacts assess via elimination diet adult population diagnose IBS ROME III criterion score great 200 IBS Severity Scoring System . The secondary objective determine inter-method agreement , individual level , sensitivity food identify via laboratory method , overall accord severity reaction ( high , medium , low , reaction ) . The third objective measure impact elimination possible food allergy symptoms IBS participant . The fourth objective determine whether intestinal permeability maybe contribute symptomatology IBS assess via intestinal permeability test . The fifth objective determine whether , period eliminate potentially reactive food , provide heal benefit gastrointestinal tract . 3 . Study Design This correlative hypothesis generate pilot study conduct single investigational site . This study open member public , staff , student Canadian College Naturopathic Medicine ( CCNM ) patient Robert Schad Naturopathic clinic ( RSNC ) suffer IBS . The study conduct CCNM Integrated Health Center ( IHC ) . Individuals interested participate screen two naturopathic doctor suitability . The screen process involve assessment inclusion exclusion criterion , confirmation symptom IBS ability commit follow dietary restriction . A second meeting another member study team also occur . Team member confer agree upon study participant select . The study participant contact phone invite participate study . The first visit schedule time copy E/C diet guideline email individual . At first visit , study participant complete Study Case Report , provide necessary blood sample laboratory test , undergo electrodermal screen food allergy , complete necessary symptom track form provide intestinal permeability test complete home prior initiate elimination phase study . The E/C diet guideline review question answer . Study participant contact telephone week 2 study member study team address dietary question may arise first week elimination diet . Subjects return clinic week 3 , 5 , 7 9 completion validate questionnaire , review study diary , query adverse event , compliance monitoring . At visit 3 ( week 5 ) , study participant also receive list food item introduce challenge portion study . The study participant provide second intestinal permeability test complete home prior initiate challenge phase study . The study participant study team member remain blinded result test completion study . The primary endpoint study degree agreement food item identify elicit reaction elimination/challenge diet versus food item identify laboratory testing . Cohen 's kappa statistical measure ass agreement . The secondary endpoint study degree inter-laboratory agreement reactionary food item across method ( laboratory electrodermal screen ) use study . Cohen 's kappa statistical measure ass agreement . The third endpoint study change score irritable bowel severity score system FAST symptom checklist end elimination diet phase baseline ( start study ) . The irritable bowel severity score system validate questionnaire use monitor irritable bowel syndrome . This score system incorporate measure pain , distension bloat due gas , bowel dysfunction ( constipation diarrhea ) quality life/global well validate reproducible sensitive mean measure symptom associate IBS . A numerical scale , 0 10 used measure symptom severity FAST Study Diet &amp; Symptoms Diary track form . The FAST symptom checklist document Dick Thom , naturopathic doctor , book `` Coping Food Intolerances : Surviving ninety . '' This checklist serve quick easy method study participant note symptom experience severity accord rating scale provide checklist . Study Duration Upon successful screening , washout period ( necessary ) , study participant participate full 9 week active treatment duration . At baseline ( week 1 ) , study participant complete validate IBS symptom questionnaire , FAST Study Symptom checklist , blood sample take necessary food allergy test electrodermal screening perform . Study participant return clinic week 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 complete validate IBS symptom questionnaire FAST Study Symptom checklist . During study visit , study participant query adverse event , study diary review , compliance monitor via diet diary . Study participant also re-queried compliance exclusion criterion protocol primarily respect confound factor new medication , natural health product . Study visit 3 7 expect take approximately 30 minute . The first visit take 1.5 hour final visit 45 minute .</detailed_description>
