	<brief_summary>The primary objective study ass effectiveness investigational binocular treatment improve vision strabismic amblyopes ( i.e. , patient lazy eye , poor vision one eye due present former eye misalignment ) . Patients randomize receive study treatment either strabismus surgery ( i.e. , corrective eye alignment surgery ) sham treatment surgery . The study hypothesis significant change vision neither pre post-surgery group significant change vision neither sham actual treatment group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This placebo-controlled , partially-randomized clinical trial . The patient assign one two group , Treatment Group A Treatment B group . To help minimize bias , blind staff member perform visual acuity assessment throughout study . The PI Sub-I 's remain blind treatment group may perform visual exam throughout study , necessary . Patients strabismus surgery prior recruit allow participate study , eligible , automatically assign Treatment Group A . Patients schedule strabismus surgery least six week screen clinic visit allow participate , eligibility determine . These patient include Treatment Group B randomize either actual treatment sham treatment . Each eligible participant include study blind treatment group s/he assign . The duration subject 's participation study 7.5 month . All subject baseline visit ass eligibility . Subjects Treatment Group A undergo strabismus surgery , previously perform , follow 6 week binocular treatment 3-6 month follow-up period . NOTE : There 4-6 week surgery start treatment allow full post-surgery recovery start treatment . Subjects Treatment Group B undergo 6 week treatment/sham follow strabismus surgery 3-6 month follow-up period . If treatment effect vision find , participant enrol sham treatment arm offer binocular treatment conclusion study follow surgery . Sham participant allow receive study treatment long complete study presence new medical condition follow surgery would consider reason exclusion treat physician .</detailed_description>
