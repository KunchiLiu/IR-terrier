	<brief_summary>The main aim clinical study find maximum dose give safely patient , potential side effect drug manage happens AZD3965 inside body . AZD3965 type drug call monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor use stop growth cancer cell kill cancer cell block action one proteins involve move chemical compound cell body . This first time type drug give patient . The drug capsule take daily . The study two part . In Part 1 , small group patient treat increase dos find high safe dose best dose give patient Part 2 study . Approximately 18 patient advance solid tumour lymphomas treated part . In Part 2 , dose find safe Part 1 give three group patient either prostate cancer , gastric cancer diffuse large B cell lymphoma . 15 patient treat group . Patients need visit hospital weekly two month every fortnight . Patients regular blood urine test , scan , heart trace eye test amongst clinical test . Research blood sample also take look happen drug inside body . Treatment continue patient 's cancer start grow continue maximum 12 month cancer respond drug . It important explain first study drug patient advance cancer unlikely patient benefit directly take part study may help improve future treatment cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial AZD3965 Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 follow roll six dose escalation schedule AZD3965 tolerate dose MCT1 inhibit ( measure least four-fold change relative baseline peak lactate level PBMCs ) and/or maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define . Approximately 36 patient advance solid tumour lymphoma enter Part 1 . The final number depend number dose escalation require reach MTD tolerate dose MCT1 inhibit . A recommended Phase II dose ( RP2D ) propose safety , pharmacokinetic , proof mechanism lactate transport inhibition peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) result Part 1 . All patient Part 2 treat RP2D explore tolerability dose schedule explore proof principle MCT1 inhibition tumour type show express MCT1 ( prostate ) AZD3965 show effect pre-clinically ( gastric diffuse large B cell lymphoma ) .</detailed_description>

Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , opinion Investigator DDO exclude patient . 3 . Known brain leptomeningeal metastasis . 4 . Patients know retinal disease macular degeneration affect visual acuity assess ophthalmologic test . 5 . Ability become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrollment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral , injected implant hormonal contraception condom , intrauterine device condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) trial six month afterwards consider eligible . 6 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] trial six month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner advise use barrier method contraception ( example , condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 7 . Any major surgery precede eight week prior start treatment major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 8 . Patients unable swallow oral medication . 9 .
