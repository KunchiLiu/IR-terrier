	<brief_title>Sirolimus Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe magnitude , inter-individual variability time course sirolimus-induced change fast serum glucose triglyceride . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess candidate genetic variant correlation change fast glucose and/or triglyceride . II . To assess tumor response Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST , version 1.1 ) explore whether correlation response change fast glucose and/or triglyceride . III . To assess toxicity Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , version 4.0 ) explore whether correlation toxicity change fast glucose and/or triglyceride . IV . To quantify determine functional status circulate regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive sirolimus orally ( PO ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
