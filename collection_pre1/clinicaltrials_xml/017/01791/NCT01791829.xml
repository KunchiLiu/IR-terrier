	<brief_summary>This multicentre , single-arm prospective cohort study evaluate risk ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence ( IBTR ) follow breast conserve surgery ( BCS ) group woman postulate low risk recurrence . Women luminal A breast cancer determine immunohistochemical ( IHC ) low risk clinical testing ( see ) treat endocrine therapy ( tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor ) five year treat breast irradiation ( BI ) . Subjects follow 10 year assess recurrent disease , new primary cancer survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Cohort Study Evaluating Risk Local Recurrence Following Breast Conserving Surgery Endocrine Therapy Low Risk Luminal A Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The independent prognostic ability luminal A subtype demonstrate two retrospective analysis prospective trial suggest luminal A combined know clinical prognostic factor could use select patient treat BCS low risk IBTR could avoid BI . Given use intrinsic subtyping combined clinical factor identify woman could avoid BI would major change clinical practice , propose prospective study necessary confirm approach accurately identify group woman low risk IBTR follow BCS . We anticipate risk IBTR low risk group likely low observe previous trial ( predict &lt; 5 % 5 year &lt; 10 % 10 year ) several reason : first , selection criterion ( node negative , luminal A , &gt; = 55 year , tumours &lt; = 2cm , excision margin &gt; = 1mm post-BCS , absence lobular cancer , extensive intraductal component lymphovascular invasion ) restrictive previous trial second , risk IBTR steadily decrease time due improvement mammographic screening , pre-op staging , tumour localization , surgical practice . The expected low failure rate unlikely warrant use radiation . A prospective cohort study identify appropriate efficient design primary hypothesis group patient low risk IBTR identify . A randomized trial could address effectiveness radiation cohort patient , would require much large sample size detect small difference , would clinically meaningful . During conduct trial anticipate patient meet study criterion decline study enrollment , continue receive BI BCS .</detailed_description>
