	<brief_summary>The propose study double-blinded randomize control trial compare patient specific instrument solely standardized instrument pre-operative planning use placement acetabular cup prosthesis use total hip arthroplasty . The investigator enroll 36 patient consented total hip arthroplasty treatment hip pathology . This treatment standard care . Patients receive standard care pre- post-operative care placement standard care implant commercially available FDA approve general use clinical indication use patient . All patient receive pre-operative CT scan surgical planning comparison post-operative CT scan . The difference intervention group creation use patient specific instrument pre-operative planning session . These instrument use placement index peripheral guide wire direct acetabular preparation placement shell assist standard surgical instrument . Print-offs pre-operative plan also use treatment group . The post-operative scan perform within two week surgery treatment control group . The investigator analyze difference acetabular shell placement ( acetabular version abduction angle ) pre-operatively plan CT scan . These difference compare control experimental group .</brief_summary>
