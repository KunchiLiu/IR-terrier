	<brief_summary>Vasovagal Syncope ( simple postural faint ) common cause acute loss consciousness . Postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) common chronic form postural lightheadedness . Together afflict many Americans , mostly young woman , prevent gainful employ school attendance . The underlying mechanism know . Our past work suggest simple molecule , nitric oxide , act subvert normal blood flow control cause blood pool gut stand . Our proposal show mechanism behind problem indicate effective medical treatment . Patients compare healthy control subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vasovagal Syncope ( VVS , simple faint ) common cause transient loss consciousness acute episodic form orthostatic intolerance ( OI ) . Postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) common chronic form OI . Both define debilitating symptom sign upright relieve recumbency . Pathophysiological mechanism remain elusive although past work show excessive upright central hypovolemia result splanchnic pool due defective splanchnic arterial venous constriction . Preliminary data support hypothesis production nitric oxide ( NO ) enhance patient result reduce sympathetic noradrenergic neurotransmission pre-junctional post-junctional site . Our approach two-fold : 1 ) We use intradermal microdialysis laser Doppler flowmetry ( LDF ) delineate microvascular mechanism NO modulation noradrenergic neurotransmission free confound systemic reflex change . 2 ) We systemically apply mechanism model orthostatic stress , low body negative pressure ( LBNP ) , measure cardiac output inert gas rebreathing , regional blood volume , regional blood flow use plethysmographic technique focus splanchnic change , muscle sympathetic nerve activity peroneal microneurography . We study synaptic peripheral neurotransmission Norepinephrine affect supplemental NO nitric oxide synthase inhibitor .</detailed_description>
