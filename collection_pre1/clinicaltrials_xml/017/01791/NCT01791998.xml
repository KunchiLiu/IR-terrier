	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Thermal Image Guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate procedural success rate use Visualase magnetic resonance ( MR ) -guided laser system target , access , thermally monitor , focally ablate MR-visible breast cancer lesion . 2 . To obtain preliminary data ablative success use pathologic assessment specimen excise subsequent ablation . OUTLINE : Patients undergo MR-thermal image guide laser interstitial thermal therapy ( LITT ) 1 hour . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-7 day .</detailed_description>
