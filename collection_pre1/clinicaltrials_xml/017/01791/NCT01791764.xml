	<brief_title>Hospital Mortality Patients Submitted Pharmacoinvasive Strategy With Tenecteplase ( TNK )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention main therapy patient ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction . However , significant portion patient wo n't receive optimal treatment due small number tertiary center interventional laboratory available 24 hour day , 7 day week . Specially large urban center rural area , tertiary care hospital restrict specific region , alternative approach must develop . The pharmacoinvasive strategy emerge alternative patient admit primary care center . It base up-front intravenous thrombolytic therapy transfer tertiary center early , systematic , coronary intervention perform 3 24 hour administration thrombolytic drug , even case successful reperfusion obtain .</detailed_description>
