Proper nutrition normalize blood sugar level , improve blood lipid prolong life people diabetes , accord Swedish Council Health Technology Assessment ( SBU ) . Dietary treatment therefore see pivotal treatment diabetes . This project aim evaluate two method structure training patient type 1 diabetes : 1 .

Eight Swedish specialist clinic participate 24 patient clinic enrol . The hypothesis structure group education heart healthy food choice low glycemic index provide improvement glycemic control quality life advance carbohydrate counting T1DM , compare regular routine . An additional hypothesis structure education healthy food choice low glycemic index lead large CVD risk factor reduction T1DM compare carbohydrate count regular routine structure education healthy food choice low glycemic index lead heart healthy food choice T1DM compare carbohydrate count regular routine . Lastly , hypothesis structure education healthy food choice low glycemic index lead cost effective T1DM compare carbohydrate count regular routine .</brief_summary>
