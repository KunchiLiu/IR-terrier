	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing Standard Wound Closure Techniques Versus TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cohera TissuGlu® study pivotal , prospective clinical investigation randomize , control , multicenter non-inferiority study compare standard wound closure technique drain ( control ) standard wound closure technique plus TissuGlu® drain ( test ) abdominoplasty . TissuGlu® apply test group prior standard closure abdominal flap thereby eliminate deadspace fascia flap . No closed suction drain inserted test group . The control group receive close suction drain per standard care . It hypothesize elimination deadspace wound test group prevent post-surgical fluid develop cause seroma number invasive treatment related aspiration test group inferior management removal drain aspiration seroma control group . The study conduct 130 patient ( 65 test , 65 control ) 5 site .</detailed_description>
