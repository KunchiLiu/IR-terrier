	<brief_title>1st-line Activity Dovitinib Correlation With Genetic Changes RCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose prospective , single centre , non-randomised , open-label , phase II study evaluate activity dovitinib treatment naïve population patient advance RCC . Background : Prior middle last decade , systemic therapy patient advance RCC immunotherapy ( interleukin-2 interferon-alpha ) limit effectiveness multitude side-effects . Since 2006 , 6 targeted therapy FDA-registered treatment advance RCC ; anti-VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( sunitinib , sorafenib pazopanib ) , anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab ( interferon-alpha ) mTOR inhibitor ( everolimus temsirolimus ) . These treatment significantly advance outcomes patient disease unfortunately represent cure . The median overall survival patient treated standard first-line therapy ( sunitinib ) 2 year median PFS subject receive agent 11 month . This mean typical time take subject develop resistance standard first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) treatment , evidence significant tumour growth imaging , 1 year . Despite recent rapid advancement treatment option subject advance RCC , still unmet need effective therapeutic option patient disease improve survival make step towards ultimate treatment aim patient metastatic disease - cure . Available data suggests dovitinib active agent metastatic RCC . If efficacy heavily pre-treated RCC population , one would expect considerably active move forward first-line setting . Dovitinib broad-targeted receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) primarily active three receptor mediate tumour growth survival : vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) . A distinguishing feature dovitinib ( compare anti-VEGFR TKI 's ) FGFR inhibition . Up-regulation fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( FGFR1 ) pathway demonstrate metastatic RCC postulate mechanism resistance anti-VEGFR therapy . This think one reason dovitinib activity subject treat prior anti-VEGFR therapy . If move FGFR inhibition forward first-line setting ( use dovitinib ) hope able prevent delay development resistance acquire FGFR up-regulation . We hope may allow subject remain first-line therapy much longer improve survival outcome group patient . Dovitinib study heavily pre-treated subject metastatic RCC , phase I/II study look active . If efficacy heavily pre-treated RCC population , possible would active move forward first-line setting . While good prognostic marker risk-stratify subject RCC , lack predictive marker guide u patient best serve different agent available use . It therefore imperative drug development study disease companion biomarker analysis identify potentially useful predictive biomarkers future research . This study also aim explore ( use FISH ) amplification/deletion status range genes-of-interest , select relevance biology RCC mechanism-of-action dovitinib . Amplification/deletion gene validate use DNA sequencing . The status genes-of-interest correlate outcome subject treat dovitinib . The hypothesis study dovitinib demonstrate anti-tumour activity administer subject advance RCC first-line setting activity correlate FGFR gene amplification status . The primary objective evaluate activity dovitinib treatment naïve population patient advance RCC . Secondary Objectives : - To determine gene amplification status FGFR-1 , -2 , -3 patient population - To measure strength correlation measure clinical efficacy FGFR gene amplification status - To evaluate safety Exploratory Objectives : - To assess amplifications/deletions gene relate RCC biology group subject treat dovitinib . - To correlate gene amplification status DNA gene sequence . - To evaluate difference tumour gene status primary metastatic sample subject post-treatment biopsy elucidate mechanism resistance dovitinib . - To evaluate effect dovitinib bone metastasis pain . Investigational treatment : Thirty patient great Auckland region treat dovitinib ( 500 mg p.o . o.d. , 5 day on/2 day ) disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient withdrawal death . The primary analysis perform 20 progression and/or death event occur . No interim efficacy analysis plan study . However , independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) review data collection ( include analyse adverse event information ) meet specify time point study . Visit schedule : Patients attend clinic visit every 3 week treatment . Tumour response assessment occur every 9 week week 54 , every 12 week thereafter disease progression ( estimate median time disease progression = 16 month ) . Once patient complete study treatment , patient continue follow 3-monthly approximately 2 month 20 death event occur . For patient three separate phase study : pre-treatment ( screen &amp; baseline ) , treatment follow-up . Pre-treatment phase ( Screening/Baseline ) : The patient must provide sign informed consent form ( ICF ) prior study related procedure . A screening period 28 day allow assess eligibility . Radiologic evaluation ( CT head , chest , abdomen pelvis ) baseline tumour measurement use RECIST v1.1 perform . Other screen baseline assessment include ECG &amp; echocardiogram ass cardiac function , performance status assessment ( ECOG &amp; WHO ) , physical examination ( include buccal cavity ) , height , weight &amp; vital sign . Laboratory investigation include haematology , chemistry , amylase , lipase , serum lipid profile , coagulation , urinalysis , thyroid function , cardiac enzymes pregnancy test ( applicable ) . Disease specific information , general medical information include medical history , concomitant medication , prognostic group accord Heng criterion demographic data also collect . Treatment phase : This study fix treatment duration , patient continue therapy disease progression , intolerable toxicity withdrawal . Following study inclusion initiation study treatment , patient visit site day 1 , 8 15 cycle 1 , day 1 every subsequent cycle . Patients first dose study treatment Day 1 , Cycle 1 . A study cycle define period 21 day . Tumour response evaluate every 3 cycle registration week 54 , every 4 cycle document disease progression . ECOG performance status assess day 1 every cycle . Safety assessment routinely perform include collection adverse event ( AEs ) , Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) , concomitant medication , vital sign , physical examination , weight , haematological biochemistry assessment , urinalysis , thyroid function cardiac enzyme . ECG , amylase , lipase , serum lipid coagulation measure clinically indicate . An echocardiogram perform week 12 24 , clinically indicate . Plasma storage collect Day 1 Cycles 1 3 . Participants bone metastasis plasma collect C-telopeptide testing day 1 week 1 , 2 13 , complete Quality Life questionnaire ( FACT-BP ) 4 time point : day 1 weeks1 , 2 , 4 13 . The End Treatment ( EOT ) visit take place approximately 7 day last dose dovitinib . At visit follow assessment perform follow data collect : physical examination , ECOG performance status , weight , vital sign , adverse event , concomitant medication , antineoplastic therapy , haematology , biochemistry , amylase lipase measurement . Safety follow-up : All patient discontinue study treatment safety follow-up visit within 30 day last dose dovitinib . Safety assessment include collection AEs , SAEs , vital sign , concomitant medication new antineoplastic therapy . Patients progress invite provide ( optional ) additional biopsy sample tumour , least 10 day last dose dovitinib , new anticancer therapy initiate . Efficacy follow-up : Patients discontinue study treatment reason progression continue radiologic assessment , use schedule patient remain treatment , document disease progression . Survival follow-up : Patients discontinue study treatment followed-up survival every 3 month clinical visit telephone call death occurs , patient lose follow-up , withdraws consent follow-up survival . Further treatment discretion investigator . Statistical Methods : All data present descriptively mean , median proportion . Progression free overall survival first dose dovitinib disease progression death determine use method Kaplan-Meier . The correlation PFS , OS baseline biomarker status well FGFR gene amplification status measure use Spearman 's rho . Generalized estimate equation ( GEE ) repeat measure also use test significance change biomarker amplification status relative baseline . Ordinal logistic regression analysis use repeated measure structure apply compare bone pain control treatment period relative baseline . Sample Size Calculation Expected Duration : The response rate ( RR ) report sunitinib , study phase III trial versus interferon first-line setting approximately 31 % , 95 % CI range 26 36 % ( Motzer , NEJM 356 : 115 , 2007 ) . The target sample size phase II study 30 , base assumption RR dovitinib would fall within range sunitinib . With sample size , prevalence dovitinib RR use RECIST 1.1 measure precision extend 15 percentage point , 95 % probability .</detailed_description>
