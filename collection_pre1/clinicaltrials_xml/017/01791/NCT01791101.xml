	<brief_summary>This Phase II multicentre study . Patients administer eltrombopag 50 mg/daily . If patient n't achieve response 2 month therapy stop eltrombopag ; patient achieve response 2 month therapy , continue eltrombopag maximum period 24 month ; 40 patient need . In stage I , 22 patient enrol ; ≤ 4 response first evaluation 2 month ( 18 % ) see , trial stop ; 5 response see , accrual continue . In stage II , 18 patient enrol . If ≤ 12 ( 30 % ) responses observed 40 patient , conclude study drug active enough . If ≥ 13 response observe , conclude eltrombopag worth study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eltrombopag Patients With Delayed Post Transplant Thrombocytopenia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence delay thrombocytopenia patient undergo allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplant ( SCT ) nearly 20-40 % ( 1-2 ) . Chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) seem frequent pathologic condition associate post SCT delay thrombocytopenia . Previous study indicate occurrence delay thrombocytopenia poor prognostic factor outcome patient undergo SCT , particularly patient cGVHD . In experience , 27 71 patient ( 38 % ) develop post SCT delay thrombocytopenia , median platelet count 29 x 109/L ( range 7-86 x 109/L ) ; cGVHD associate delay thrombocytopenia 54 % case . The platelet count &gt; 50 &lt; 100 x 109/L 8 patient ( 30 % ) patient 50 x 109/L 19 ( 70 % ) among 9 20 x 109/L . The median post SCT survival 12 month patient develop delay thrombocytopenia vs. &gt; 36 month patient without delayed thrombocytopenia . The rate patient alive 12 , 24 33 month SCT 41 % , 41 % 7 % among patient delay thrombocytopenia vs. 93 % , 87 % 87 % ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . In patient cGVHD incidence mortality significantly high develop post SCT thrombocytopenia , i.e . 8 13 ( 61.5 % ) vs. 2 19 ( 10.5 % ) ( p=0.005 ) . Our data confirms result previous study . Therefore , occurrence delay thrombocytopenia patient undergo SCT poor prognostic factor improvement condition may favourably affect patient ' outcome . The pathophysiology cGVHD relay post SCT delay thrombocytopenia complex partial understood . Biological clinical evidence support autoimmune-like thrombocytopenia increase platelet destruction ; mechanism also suggest response therapeutic strategy generally adopt treat classical immune thrombocytopenia steroid , high dose intravenous immunoglobulin , splenectomy , rituximab . However mechanism consistent impaired platelet production also suggest . Adopting index plasma glycocalicin , plasma thrombopoietin ( TPO ) , circulate B cell produce anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody , Yamazaki et al . study 23 SCT recipient prolong isolated thrombocytopenia apparent cause engraftment failure , recurrence underlying malignancy , microangiopathy drug compare data observe similar cohort SCT recipient thrombocytopenia , patient primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) aplastic anemia . Despite frequent occurrence antiplatelet antibody response , patient post SCT thrombocytopenia show glycocalicin index TPO status similar see aplastic anemia . TPO level normal nearly 30 % patient . Recently , Bao et al . show improved regulatory T-cell ( T-regs ) activity patient chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) treat thrombolytic agent , suggest possible role platelet count improve T-reg function restore immune tolerance . On ground similarly ITP , stimulation thrombopoiesis thrombolytic agent could beneficial patient persistent post SCT thrombocytopenia platelet count cGVHD manifestation . Eltrombopag ( Revolade ) thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicate treatment adult patient ITP relapsed/refractory splenectomy ; eltrombopag may consider second line treatment adult non-splenectomised patient surgery contraindicate . Eltrombopag also development treatment thrombocytopenia due hepatitis C virus HCV , chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia MDS/AML .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients develop delay thrombocytopenia , i.e . Platelet count 50 x 109/l 3 month SCT ; Patients underwent allogeneic SCT match relate unrelated donor ; Patients develop CGVHDrelated delayed thrombocytopenia . The definition cGVHDrelated delay thrombocytopenia : platelet count 50 x 109/l month 3 SCT presence clinical , radiological and/or laboratory find indicative cGVHD ( grade ) ; Patients underwent SCT lymphoma ( Hodgkin nonHodgkin , indolent aggressive ) , multiple myeloma ; Sexually active male accept use condom intercourse take drug 12 month stop treatment father child period . A condom require use also vasectomise men ( well intercourse male partner ) order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Refer also Appendix C. Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study ; For study population , nonchildbearing potential define current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause ( please refer Appendix C ) ; OR Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject practice adequate contraception 30 day prior start eltrombopag , negative pregnancy test prior start eltrombopag , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 6 month completion treatment . Written inform consent obtain subject . Patients underwent SCT aploidentical donor cord blood ; Patients underwent SCT diseases different lymphoma multiple myeloma ; Patients life threaten bleeding complication ; Patients expect survival &lt; 1 month ; Patients delay thrombocytopenia related medical condition cGVHD ; Patients progressive non stabilize cGVHD necessitate intensification immune suppressive treatment last 2 week ; Patients need introduce increase dosage steroid , immune suppressive cytotoxic agent time enrolment study start eltrombopag ; patient already treatment fix , stabilize dosage steroid immune suppressive agent cGVHD may include study ; Patients receive concomitant erythropoietin treatment ; Patients active deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) ; Patients venous occlusive disease ( VOD ) ; Patients grade 34 hyper bilirubinemia ; elevation hepatic enzyme cGVHD consider criterion exclusion . Patients baseline elevation hepatic enzyme monitor carefully order point possible addictive eltrombopag related hepatotoxicity ; Patients hepatic cirrhosis ; Patients transplant relatedmicroangiopathy ; Patients active infection ( CMV reactivation include ) ; Patients hypersensitive study drug ; Patients unable stop medication know cause drugdrug interaction eltrombopag .</criteria>
