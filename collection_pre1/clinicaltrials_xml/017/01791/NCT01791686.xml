	<brief_summary>This study evaluate study drug ( CDX-1135 ) patient dense deposit disease ( DDD ) . The objective evaluate safety activity repeat dose CDX-1135 pediatric adult patient DDD . After screen , eligible patient enter Induction Period . The Induction Period 4 week . Following normalization complement activity , patient enter Maintenance Period.The total treatment duration 26 week .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Among criterion , patient must 1 . Patient and/or parent/legal guardian ( appropriate ) must give write informed consent 2 . Four ( 4 ) year age old 3 . Must DDD , confirm renal biopsy within 6 month study enrollment ( Confirmation University Iowa investigator require ) . If patient post transplant , repeat renal transplant biopsy must show C3 dominant glomerulonephritis , patient must history know DDD native kidney 4 . Signs abnormal complement pathway activity 5 . Serum creatinine level must abnormal 6 . Screening lab value criterion : 1 . Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dL 2 . Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm^3 3 . ALT AST ≤ 3.0 x upper limit normal 4 . C3 serum &lt; 50 % low limit normal 5 . 24 hour urine protein &gt; 1000 mg/day , urine protein : creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 7 . Both male female patient childbearing potential enrol must use adequate birth control trial 1 month stop study drug 8 . Willing able comply study procedure , include prestudy vaccination ( meningitis , haemophilus pneumococcus ) agree renal biopsy Week 13 end study 9 . Any antiproteinuric medication ( eg , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin II receptor blocker ) must stable dose 4 week prior first dose CDX1135 Among criterion , patient must 1 . Dialysis low estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m^2 4week period prior Screening 2 . Active untreated systemic bacterial infection 3 . Pregnant lactate 4 . Rituximab therapy ( unless discontinue B cell level immunoglobulin level normalize study entry ) 5 . Immunosuppressive therapy ( except low dose steroid [ ≤10 mg per day ] give nonDDD related condition asthma ) . Exceptions make renal transplant patient , may receive appropriate therapy need maintain transplant ( i.e. , prevent rejection ) 6 . Treatment complement inhibitor within 3 month study entry investigational drug , device , experimental procedure within 4 week prior enrollment 7 . For renal transplant patient : histology finding treatable rejection ( i.e . usual transplant physician would seek treat ) . Chronic allograft nephropathy exclusionary provide patient 's glomerular filtration rate meet entry criterion 8 . Preexisting condition association potential cause DDD ( i.e. , Monoclonal Gammopathy Undetermined Significance ) alternate glomerular disease 9 . Cancer except adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer , curatively treat situ disease , cancer patient diseasefree ≥ 5 year 10 . Myocardial infarction within 1 year screening , congestive heart failure , arrhythmia persistent medication screen chronic lung disease 11 . Known HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C 12 . Any medical psychological condition would increase patient 's risk study would interfere interpretation study</criteria>
