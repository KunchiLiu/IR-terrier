	<brief_summary>This study look new drug call AZD4547 test treatment oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer . AZD4547 drug specifically `` block '' protein call fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR1 ) involve process help cancer cell grow . These protein may also responsible development resistance hormonal therapy use treat breast cancer . AZD4547 yet approve use breast cancer therefore use study research drug . The investigator also test theory necessary high level FGFR1 present body see benefit AZD4547 . ( Stage 1 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD4547 &amp; Anastrozole Letrozole ( NSAIs ) ER+ Breast Cancer Patients Who Have Progressed NSAIs ( RADICAL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study carry two stage . Stage 1 find suitable dose AZD4547 use together class drug call nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor ( e.g . anastrozole letrozole ) i.e . dose cause many unacceptable side effect . Patients hormone sensitive ( oestrogen receptor positive ) breast cancer , whose current treatment anastrozole letrozole recently stop work properly eligible stage . Stage 2 assess efficacy AZD4547 , base change tumour size 12 week ( progression prior week 12 ) , use combination either anastrozole letrozole patient hormone sensitive ( oestrogen receptor positive ) breast cancer , progress treatment either anastrozole letrozole set . In stage , study look well new treatment tolerate . Each patient allow take part either stage 1 2 . The study run 9 Hospitals across England Scotland .</detailed_description>
