	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether NXN-462 , selective nNOS inhibitor , effective reduce pain level patient post-herpetic neuralgia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy , Tolerability , Safety NXN-462 Patients With Post-Herpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NXN-462 design target nitric oxide synthase system ( NOS ) , specifically neuronal NOS ( nNOS ) isoform . By design , NXN-462 potent inhibitor nNOS good affinity , little affinity range G protein-coupled receptor , ion channel , enzyme . NXN-462 develop oral therapy treatment neuropathic pain syndrome , include PHN . This drug design strategy provide new therapeutic paradigm treatment chronic neuropathic pain .</detailed_description>
