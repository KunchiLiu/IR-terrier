	<detailed_description>Background Significance Prostate cancer common cancer second-leading cause cancer death amongst men United States . Initially , tumor biopsy guide detected conventional B-mode transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) . Unfortunately , prostate cancer highly variable ultrasound echo pattern may indistinguishable normal prostate , sonographic appearance BPH overlap prostatic carcinoma , limited accuracy conventional ultrasound , produce sensitivity specificity prostate carcinoma 40-50 % . There therefore urgent need good localization accurate biopsy prostate cancer . Sonoelastography image technology predicate reproducible difference backscatter ultrasound signal produce compression tissue vary stiffness . It permit measurement elastic property tissue . These measurement transpose onto conventional anatomic ultrasound image , produce colorize overlay allow direct visualization anatomic distribution tissue stiffness . Previously , several study report feasibility sonoelastography distinguish benign malignant nodule thereby guide biopsy . These assessment base change anatomic appearance nodule compression transrectal ultrasound probe . However , report specify criterion use determine lesion see elastography lesion see histopathology , ass whether biopsy plan assistance sonoelastography would intersect foci prostate cancer , address histopathologic characteristic area prostate falsely positive sonoelastography . If sonoelastography accurately delineate foci tumor prostate B mode ultrasound , could use guide biopsy , would fewer missed cancer biopsy . In addition , sonoelastography-guided biopsy may representative ultimate Gleason Score tumor . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To determine whether prostate biopsy plan sonoelastographic guidance would likely random prostate biopsy intersect foci carcinoma prostate gland . Aim 2 : To determine whether prostate biopsy plan sonoelastographic guidance would likely random prostate biopsy yield histopathology representative final Gleason Score obtain pathologic assessment resect prostate .</detailed_description>
