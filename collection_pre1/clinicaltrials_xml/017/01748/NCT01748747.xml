	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study vaccine therapy resiquimod treat patient stage II-IV melanoma remove surgery . Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell tumor cell . Biological therapy , resiquimod , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . It yet know whether Gag:267-274 peptide vaccine resiquimod effective give together separately</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Resiquimod Treating Patients With Stage II-IV Melanoma That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate immune response immunization regimen determine optimal regimen term immune response recommend phase II testing . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate adverse event profile immunization regimen . II . Evaluate disease-free survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe immunological efficacy vaccine preparation Gag267-274 ( Gag:267-274 peptide vaccine ) resiquimod , measure frequency interferon ( IFN ) gamma production peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) . II . Examine immune response tumor antigen analog MART-1a ( MART-1 antigen ) versus xenoantigen Gag267-274 . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 treatment group . ARM I : Patients receive MART-1 antigen Gag:267-274 peptide vaccine emulsify Montanide ISA 51 VG subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive MART-1 antigen emulsify Montanide ISA 51 VG SC follow resiquimod apply topically day 1 . ARM III : Patients receive MART-1 antigen Gag:267-274 peptide vaccine emulsify Montanide ISA 51 VG SC follow resiquimod apply topically day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 24 month .</detailed_description>
