	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify biological marker might predict premature infant higher risk develop BPD , correlate presence marker infant symptom lung function first year discharge hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) common form lung injury trigger premature birth unavoidable exposure treatment regularly use premature infant , include mechanical ventilation oxygen well condition occur frequently among premature infant include infection . Almost infant bear prematurely expose either mechanical ventilation , extra oxygen , many develop least one infection ; however , premature infant develop BPD . There currently way identify infant risk develop BPD , prognostic diagnostic test determine severity lung disease first year discharge hospital . The application UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry quantification urinary biomarkers oxidative stress important technical innovation permit sensitive reproducible analysis urinary biomarkers minimal sample preparation well define disease phenotype . Establishing direct correlation biomarkers oxidative stress GRP accelerate investigation mechanism lead chronic pediatric lung disease childhood origins pulmonary disease .</detailed_description>
