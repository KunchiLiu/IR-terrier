	<brief_summary>The Severe Asthma Research Program III NIH cooperative agreement involve 7 clinical center encompass multidisciplinary partnership asthma clinician-scientists scientist expertise immunology , pulmonary physiology , molecular genetics , molecular phenotyping , imaging , bioinformatics . These clinical center jointly recruit volunteer asthma observational longitudinal follow-up study . However , center also conduct specific mechanistic research project participate institution . The University Pittsburgh 's SARP III study determine molecular clinical stability asthma phenotypes time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The longitudinal follow-up study divide characterization longitudinal phase . During characterization subject undergo baseline evaluation include include answer questionnaire , lung function testing , chest tomography . Subsequently , determine steroid responsiveness , subject receive one intramuscular dose 40 mg 1ml ( 1 mg/kg child &lt; 18 year old , 40 mg maximum . Participants University Pittsburgh undergo bronchoscopy provide airway sample . The longitudinal phase include 36 month follow-up time annual visit phone call every 6 month . During , participant answer questionnaire provide sputum sample two occasion , perform lung function test . The SARP III longitudinal follow study ( center ) determine long term stability implication clinical molecular asthma phenotype identify potential systemic biomarkers phenotypes The University Pittsburgh center test hypothesis ) mast cell signature present longitudinally maintain severe asthma ; b ) That persistent signature determines short long term outcome interaction lung inflammatory cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Asthmatic Subjects Previous asthma diagnosis FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility ≥12 % airway hyperresponsiveness reflect methacholine PC20 ≤16 mg/mL ( Historical methacholine data previous NIH trial [ SARP I II , AsthmaNet , ALAACRC , ACRN CARE ] allow ) . Exclusion criterion include follow : Pregnancy characterization phase Current smoking , Smoking history &gt; 10 pack year ≥30 year age , smoke history &gt; 5 pack year &lt; 30 year age ( Note : subject smoke history , smoke within past year ) , Other chronic pulmonary disorder associate asthmalike symptom , include ( limited ) cystic fibrosis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic bronchitis , vocal cord dysfunction ( sole cause respiratory symptom PI 's discretion ) , severe scoliosis chest wall deformity affect lung function , congenital disorder lung airway , History premature birth 35 week gestation , Unwillingness receive intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide injection . Evidence participant family may unreliable poorly adherent asthma treatment study procedure , Planning relocate clinical center area study completion , Any criterion place subject unnecessary risk accord judgment Principal Investigator and/or attend physician ( ) record , Currently participate investigational drug trial . Healthy Controls : Inclusion Criteria Healthy subject age 18 65 At least 3 7 subject per center age 35 old History chronic disease affect lung : Chronic airway disease ( asthma , cystic fibrosis , COPD , chronic bronchitis , bronchiectasis ) ; Interstitial lung disease , sarcoidosis , occupational lung disease ; Obstructive sleep apnea ; Vocal cord dysfunction ; Severe scoliosis chest wall deformity . A history suggestive allergic rhinitis ( base best judgment physician investigator ) . A history eczema . Chronic sinusitis . An improvement FEV1 12 % follow 4 puff albuterol . Chronic systemic disease require ongoing antiinflammatory treatment . Current use beta adrenergic block agent cholinesterase inhibitor ( medicine use treat myasthenia gravis Alzheimer 's disease ) . Smoking history &gt; 10 pack year ≥30 year age , smoke history &gt; 5 pack year &lt; 30 year age ( Note : subject smoke history , smoke within past year ) . Respiratory tract infection within past 4 week . Pregnancy . History premature birth ( &lt; 35 week ) . Any criteria place subject increase risk complication study procedure , accord judgment Principal Investigator and/or attend physician ( ) record .</criteria>
