	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis bacterial infection cause 1.1 million death annually worldwide . Diagnosis disease often time consume challenge . Many case tuberculosis require advance expensive diagnostic method restrict availability resource limited country burden tuberculosis high . The development rapid point care diagnostics require . Published data confirm train African giant-pouched rat able identify M. tuberculosis culture olfactory recognition . A first trial use electronic nose report rate detection 85 % tuberculosis patient . A trial close June 2011 remain unpublished , yet . The olfactory pattern potentially allow recognition tuberculosis remain unknown . This trial aim detect first pattern volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) bear potential development fine tuning . A technical prototypic device Siemens use pattern detection . The study compare 3 group patient : - patient confirm active pulmonary tuberculosis ( n=20 ) - patient inflammatory lung disease ( pneumonia , sarcoidosis , COPD , bronchial carcinoma ) ( n=20 ) - healthy volunteer work hospital visit hospital regularly Detailed data study subject collect trial order eliminate confounding factor . Furthermore , detailed data surroundings patient , surroundings technical device operator capture . Hypothesis : The pattern exhale volatile organic compound allow detection pulmonary tuberculosis</brief_summary>
