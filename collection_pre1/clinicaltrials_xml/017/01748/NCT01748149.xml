	<brief_title>Vemurafenib Children With Recurrent/Refractory BRAFV600E-mutant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , safety pharmacokinetic trial determine MTD and/or select recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) vemurafenib child recurrent refractory glioma contain BRAFV600E BRAF Ins T mutation . Using RP2D , study team conduct Phase 0 study pre-surgical cohort 10 patient require debulking surgery time recurrence . These patient receive neo-adjuvant vemurafenib , thus allow study team measure intra-tumoral drug concentration target inhibition . An expansion cohort enrol allow study team preliminarily estimate efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically confirm diagnosis glioma ( WHO Grades IIV ) eligible . Patient tumor must test positive BRAFV600E mutation UCSF Molecular Pathology central laboratory . If mutation confirm prior test archival tumor available confirm presence BRAFV600E mutation , patient must tumor biopsy collect tumor sample mutation confirmation . Patient must less 18 year age registration safety study . Patients must &lt; 25 year age Phase 0 Efficacy Cohorts . Patients neurological deficit deficit stable minimum 1 week prior registration . Patients must able swallow tablet ( applesauce , part bioavailability `` crushed '' six patient cohort ) . Patient must MR imaging perform within two week first dose drug . Karnofsky Performance Scale ( KPS &gt; 16 yrs age ) Lansky Performance Score ( LPS ≤ 16 year age ) ≥ 60 assess within two week prior registration . The patient must fail least one prior therapy besides surgery radiation chemotherapy ( either cytotoxic biologic agent ) prior study registration . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Patients must receive last dose know myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy least three week prior study registration least six week nitrosourea . Biologic agent : Patient must recover toxicity potentially related agent receive last dose biologic agent ≥ 7 day prior study registration . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval discuss study chair . For biologic agent prolonged halflife , appropriate interval since last treatment discuss study chair prior registration . Monoclonal antibody treatment : At least three halflives must elapse prior registration . Such patient discuss study chair prior registration . Radiation : Patients must : Had last fraction local irradiation primary tumor ≥12 week prior registration ; investigator remind review potentially eligible case avoid confusion pseudoprogression . Had last fraction craniospinal irradiation total body irradiation &gt; 12 week prior registration Bone Marrow Transplant : Patient must : ≥ 6 month since allogeneic bone marrow transplant prior registration ≥ 3 month since autologous bone marrow/stem cell prior registration Corticosteroids : Patients receive dexamethasone must stable decrease dose least 1 week prior registration . Growth factor : Off colony form growth factor ( ) least 1 week prior registration ( filgrastim , sargramostim , erythropoietin ) least 2 week long act formulation . Organ Function : Documented within 14 day registration within 7 day start treatment . Adequate bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/μl ( unsupported ) Platelets ≥ 75,000/μl ( unsupported ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL ( may support ) Adequate hepatic function : Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal age SGPT/SGOT ( ALT/AST ) ≤ 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal age Adequate renal function : Creatinine clearance Radioisotope GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2 serum creatinine base age follow : Less equal 5 year age= Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) 0.8 ; Older 5 10 year younger= Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) 1.0 ; Older 10 15 year younger= Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) 1.2 ; Older 15 years= Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) 1.5 Electrolytes : Sodium : ≥ 130 ≤ 145 mmol/L Potassium : 3.4 4.8 mmol/L Calcium : ≥ 7 mg/dL Magnesium : ≥ 0.7 mmol/L Nutrition : Albumin ≥ 3 g/dL Cardiac : QTc interval &lt; 450 msec EKG . Female patient childbearing potential must pregnant breastfeeding . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test . The effect Vemurafenib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception : ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation , four week dose vemurafenib cease . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 week completion study drug administration . All skin lesion suspicious keratoacanthomas/cSCC find baseline dermatology visit must excise . Signed informed consent accord institutional guideline must obtain . Specific inclusion criterion PreSurgical Cohort : Patients 25 year age eligible presurgical cohort . Patients 1825 year age treat adult FDAapproved dose 960 mg BID enrol immediately . Patients le 18 year age enrol treated pediatric MTD define Safety Cohort . Surgical patient must tumor need removed/debulked accessible neurosurgeon . Need surgery must patient take drug 10 day surgery . Specific inclusion criterion Expansion cohort : • Expansion cohort open tissue drug level PreSurgical cohort meet criterion ( Tumor tissue drug concentration great 50 nM ) . Patients 25 year age eligible expansion cohort . Patients 18 25 year age take adult dose 960 mg BID . Patients le 18 year age take MTD define safety cohort . Patients clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) likely interfere study procedure result . All patient know clinical diagnosis Neurofibromatosis Type 1 exclude . Patients receive anticancer investigational drug therapy . Patients uncontrolled seizure eligible study . Previous BRAF inhibitor use vemurafenib , GSK2118436 sorafenib . Patients QTc interval &gt; 450 msec factor increase risk QTprolongation arrhythmic event ( e.g. , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history long QT interval syndrome ) include heart failure meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV definition exclude . Required use concomitant medication prolong QT interval . A comprehensive list agent potential cause QTc prolongation find http : //www.azcert.org/medicalpros/druglists/browsedruglist.cfm ? alpha=A Patients inability return followup visit obtain followup study require assess toxicity therapy . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vemurafenib . Negative result BRAFV600E screen test perform UCSF .</criteria>
