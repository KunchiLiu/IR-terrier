	<brief_summary>TREX phase IIIb , multicenter , randomize , control clinical study . Subjects randomize 1:2 `` monthly '' ( control arm ) `` treat extend '' protocol ( comparator arm ) respectively . TREX assess safety , tolerability efficacy intravitreal injection ( IVT ) 0.5mg ranibizumab give monthly 100 week follow pro nata ( PRN ) treatment 56 week compare Treat Extend protocol 156 week patient wet age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Subjects treat treat extend protocol receive 3 consecutive IVT 0.5 mg ranibizumab ( visit 2 , 4 5 ) . Starting week 8 , subject achieve `` dry '' macula ; sign active exudation resolve begin Treat Extend protocol ( visit lengthen 2 week interval every visit dry macular maintain ) . At begin 104-week endpoint subject initially randomize TREX cohort transition PRN re-treatment exudative disease activity 12-week interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial compare result 2 cohort , different treatment interval , assess safety , tolerability efficacy IVT ranibizumab treatment wet AMD . Specifically , trial evaluate ability reduce amount visit IVT ranibizumab treatment need maintain exudation-free macula . Subjects cohorts follow total 156 week . Cohort A ( control arm , monthly , n=20 ) Subjects receive monthly treatment IVT 0.5 mg ranibizumab Day 0 week 100 . Monthly treatment define every 28 day ( ±7 day ) . Dosing occur earlier 21 day previous treatment . Week 104 - Week 156 Starting week 104 subject see monthly treat IVT ranibizumab pro nata ( PRN ) base pre-defined re-treatment criterion . Retreatment criterion PRN phase Re-treatment initiate follow criterion meet : - Presence abnormal intraretinal subretinal fluid high resolution SD-OCT. - Presence new intraretinal subretinal hemorrhage relate AMD examination . - 10 letter loss previous visit , relate active wet AMD opinion treat investigator Cohort B ( comparator arm , TREX , n=40 ) Subjects receive minimum 3 consecutive IVT 0.5 mg ranibizumab ( visit 2 , 4 5 ) . Starting week 8 , subject achieve `` dry '' macula ; sign active exudation resolve ophthalmic exam SD-OCT evaluation begin Treat Extend protocol . For macula consider `` dry '' must meet following criterion : 1 . Resolution intraretinal subretinal fluid 2 . Resolution subretinal hemorrhage relate active exudative AMD Resolution pigment epithelial detachment ( PED ) require macula consider `` dry '' . Small intraretinal cystic area observe SD-OCT acceptable correspond macula consider dry . The criterion specific ; see reference image ( Appendix D ) examples acceptable intraretinal cystic space . When cyst describe Appendix D present macula consider dry notate SD-OCT interpretation . Also , minimal increase retinal thicken SD-OCT without definitive intraretinal subretinal exudative fluid observe correspond macula consider dry . Once `` dry '' macula achieve interval visit lengthen 2-week increment , every visit macula `` dry '' . IVT ranibizumab render every visit , early 7 day target date later 7 day target date ; interval visit individualize base patient 's response treatment . The interval injection exceed 12 week After subject extend beyond 4-weeks develops recurrent exudative disease activity , eye treat treatment interval next visit reduce 2 week , compare previous treatment interval . The interval treatment reduce 2-week interval dry macula establish . Once dry macula achieve , interval visit extend 1-week interval , instead 2-week interval . For example : If recurrent exudative disease activity detect 8-week interval , eye treat interval next visit reduce 6 week ; macula dry 6-week interval , interval increase 7 week . If macula dry 7-week interval , interval increase 8 week , etc . Once eye extend 1-week interval , recurrent exudative disease detect , treatment interval next visit reduce 1 week , compare previous treatment interval , continue decrease 1-week interval dry 4-week interval reach . Once dry macula establish , recent interval treatment maintain one additional visit ; macula remain dry time , interval extend 1-week increment . If eye exhibit recurrent exudative disease activity 3 time give interval unable extend beyond interval , eye continue treatment next shorter interval 3 consecutive visit . After 3 visit , interval visit extend 1-week interval , macula remain `` dry '' . If eye exhibit recurrent exudative disease activity , interval decrease 1-week interval macula `` dry . '' The eye continue treatment interval 3 consecutive visit extend 1-week . This pattern repeat 3 visit `` dry '' interval repeat time eye become `` wet '' attempt another 1-week extension . Evidence recurrent exudative activity Clinical evidence recurrent exudative disease activity require reduce interval treatment include follow : 1 . Evidence subretinal intraretinal fluid SD-OCT classify small intraretinal cystic area unrelated active exudative AMD ( Appendix D ) minimal increase retinal thicken SD-OCT without definitive intraretinal subretinal fluid 2 . New macular hemorrhage relate active exudative AMD . 3 . ETDRS VA loss 5 letter previous measurement due neovascular AMD disease process correspond SD-OCT evidence fluid macula . 4 . Increase CRT 50 micron due active exudative AMD . The isolated presence PED , enlargement PED , constitute evidence exudative disease activity . If eye ETDRS VA decrease ≥ 4 line ( 20 letter ) subretinal macular hemorrhage 1DD large , point trial , subject subsequently treat ranibizumab every 4 week . Week 104 - Week 156 Starting Week 104 subject achieve `` dry '' macula , 12 week interval see monthly treat pro nata ( PRN ) base pre-defined re-treatment criterion . Study visit schedule occur every 28 ( ±7 ) day relative date week 104 visit . Retreatment criterion PRN phase Re-treatment initiate follow criterion meet : - Presence abnormal intraretinal subretinal fluid high resolution SD- OCT. - Presence new intraretinal subretinal hemorrhage relate AMD examination . - 10 letter loss previous visit , relate active wet AMD opinion thetreating investigator Starting Week 104 , subject NOT achieve extension 12-week treatment interval continue treat extend protocol . At time week 104 156 subject achieves `` dry '' macula , 12-week interval , immediately begin monthly PRN treatment base pre-defined re-treatment criterion . Study visit schedule occur every 28 ( ±7 ) day , relative date 12-week interval achieve . Subjects treat visit achieve 12 week interval ( date PRN treatment begin ) .</detailed_description>
