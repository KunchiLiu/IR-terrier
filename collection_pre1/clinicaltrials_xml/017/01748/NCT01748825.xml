	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm solid tumor standard therapy know prolong survival fail standard therapy exist . Patients must measurable disease evaluable disease escalation phase ; 6 additional patient enrol MTD evaluation PK PD endpoint ( Expansion Cohort A ) . For 6patient BRCAmutation expansion cohort , patient must measurable disease ; however , tumor biopsy optional . For Expansion Cohort B , patient must tumor amenable biopsy ( excisional incision biopsy skin H &amp; N lesion visualization ) willingness undergo tumor biopsy patient undergoing procedure due medical necessity tissue may collect , tumor biopsy tissue previous research study medical care available submission registration . Criteria submission tissue : Tissue must collect within 3 month prior registration Patient receive intervening therapy cancer since collection tumor sample Tumor tissue must meet minimum requirement Patients must complete chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , biologic therapy great equal 3 week ( &gt; 5 halflives , whichever short ) prior enter study . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND/Phase 0 study equal 1 week palliative radiation therapy . Patients must recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event . Age great equal 18 year age . ECOG performance status less equal 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal . The effect AZD1775 develop human fetus unknown . For reason molecular inhibitor Wee1 kinase know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential ( WoCBP ) may include acceptable contraception place two week study entry , duration treatment study drug , 2 month last dose AZD1775 . Male patient involve study must agree avoid procreative unprotected sex ( i.e. , use acceptable form contraception ) must donate sperm study 3 month last dose AZD1775 . Where female partner pregnant use effective birth control , men advise abstain study 3 month last dose AZD1775 . Female partner , childbearing potential , men participate clinical study AZD1775 also require use effective contraceptive measure partner study drug 3 month thereafter . Male patient advise arrange freezing sperm sample prior start study wish father child AZD1775 3 month stop AZD1775 . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother study drug , breastfeed discontinue prior first study drug woman refrain nurse throughout treatment period 14 day follow last dose study drug .
