	<brief_summary>Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) unparalleled efficacy treat severe depression resistant common modality treatment , antidepressant medication . Although treatment ECT benefit many individual treatment resistant depression ( rate high 50-75 % ) , widespread use hinder social stigma associate treatment , well significant cognitive side effect . Moreover , ECT precisely target , since produce widespread activation brain surface , turn , affect many different functional area . Magnetic seizure therapy ( MST ) currently investigate alternative ECT , focus one area brain . Rather apply electrical stimulus induce seizure , do ECT , MST use repetitive magnetic stimulation produce seizure . Preliminary research suggest MST result therapeutic effect comparable produce ECT , without negative side effect cognition . The propose study randomize , control trial , efficacy side effect profile MST compare ECT . If successful , result study may lead increase treatment availability accessibility , well lessen substantial health care cost associate treatment resistant depression .</brief_summary>
