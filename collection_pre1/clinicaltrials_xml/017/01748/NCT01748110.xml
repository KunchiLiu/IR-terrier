	<detailed_description>This project ass whether health-promotion intervention initiate prior continue beyond radical prostatectomy treatment clinically localized prostate cancer result improvement overall health , health-related quality life , specific urological outcome , specifically recovery EF urinary continence . While abundance literature support harmful impact obesity prostate cancer risk , delay diagnosis , surgical outcome , pathological outcome overall mortality , paucity data impact health/fitness intervention immediate post-operative quality life outcome . Data support benefit lifestyle intervention term overall health come Look AHEAD trial [ 1 ] , demonstrate clinically significant weight loss improvement diabetic control cardiovascular risk factor obese , type 2 diabetic . It expect intervention result beneficial change participant ' overall health status represent short term improvement objective clinical measurement ( reduction weight , BP , serum cholesterol fast serum glucose level ) , overall health-related quality life . The investigator also hypothesize intervention result improve post-operative urological outcome , namely accelerated return urinary continence EF . Urologists good position promote healthy living , initiate intervention prior surgery provide foundation healthy lifestyle enable patient maintain aforementioned benefit well beyond surgery , extend beyond urological domain . The goal prove patient participate one two lifestyle intervention , intense health promotion intervention less intense text-message program , report improve physical parameter : BMI , BP , metabolic parameter ( fast serum glucose , serum cholesterol ) , health-related quality life , recovery EF urinary continence ( latter three report questionnaire ) compare patient give standard advice prior radical prostatectomy . Specific Aim : To evaluate mean randomize , control , clinical trial relative benefit cost intensive health-promotion intervention , compare less intensive intervention consist regular daily text message health reminder , compare standard advice give patient undergo radical prostatectomy . While intuitive healthier patient feel well easy recovery radical prostatectomy , exist evidence thus far support . The investigation apply single center , randomize , clinical 18 month study design employ validate instrument assess health relate quality life status , EF urinary continence . The study design single center , randomize , clinical 3-arm study , compare effect intensive lifestyle intervention base Look AHEAD regimen vs. less intensive text message intervention vs. standard lifestyle advice typically provide prior radical prostatectomy . For control arm , participant complete post-operative assessment month 3 , 6 , 12 18 repeat baseline questionnaires measure . Please note recruit patient local , follow-up questionnaire obtain via mail , physical parameter derive direct contact patient 's local care provider . In event possible , rely patient self-report . Standard practice associate surgery postoperative laboratory test perform . Patients may use phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ( sildenafil , tadalafil vardenafil ) follow surgery conventional `` on-demand '' therapy erectile dysfunction ( ED ) . For text message ( Tailored Rapid Interactive Mobile Messaging-TRIMM ) arm , standard care , plus : `` Push '' `` pull '' -type text message deliver frequency 3-4 times/day , start least 4 week prior surgery continue 8 week postoperatively . Specific content develop field-tested acceptability . Patients ask select three seven possible health-related goal target specific category , include dietary ( increase fruit vegetable consumption ) , exercise ( walk ) behavioral ( less eat response stress ) goal . All text message participant also receive semi-weekly message relate specific urological goal relate surgery , perform Kegel exercise maintain intimate relationship . At least one message daily require response , target feedback give base response . For example , participant issue pedometer ask record daily step . If step report day goal , automatically generate instructions/praise/alternatives proffer . For intensive intervention , standard care , plus : Weekly meeting , start least 4 week prior surgery continue 8 week postoperatively , consist support group meeting 3 times/month use Look AHEAD curriculum modify short term intervention , plus monthly individual follow-up visit . This individual monthly visit would include focused evaluation participant , include review goal feedback progress . The intensive intervention provide relevant diet exercise education support long-term lifestyle change . The intensive intervention facilitate physician trained provider . At monthly visit , patient 's weight record review activity diet log conduct . A topical lesson correspond Look AHEAD curriculum [ 1 ] give participant would give chance discus lesson road-blocks progress occur . Participants issue pedometer ask record daily step , use surrogate physical activity . The sample size 25 patient randomize study arm . There total 5 arm ( total 125 patient ) , study divide base patient proximity Johns Hopkins Hospital . Local patient ( defined patient able physically present study session well follow-up appointment ) randomize 3 arm : control , TRIMM intensive intervention . Distant patient ( defined patient able present study session well follow-up appointment ) randomize 2 arm : control TRIMM . Study procedures involve screen inform consent initial consultation , baseline evaluation include medical clearance completion validate questionnaire . Randomization achieve computerized random number generator , patient stratify base age . Assessment tool consist IIEF questionnaire , Quality Erection Questionnaire ( QEQ ) health relate quality life instrument : RAND 12-item Health Survey ( SF-12 ) Expanded Prostate Cancer index Composite Short Form ( EPIC-26-sexual urinary domain ) . Standard practice associate surgery , blood transfusion postoperative laboratory test perform . Patients prescribed phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ( sildenafil , tadalafil vardenafil ) 1 month follow surgery use conventional `` on-demand '' therapy . Adverse event monitoring perform .</detailed_description>
