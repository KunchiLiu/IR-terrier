	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Reducing Oral Pain Dry Mouth After Surgery Patients With Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively determine long 4-day course dexamethasone ( equivalent ) management postoperative pain dysphagia follow transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) superior current standard single injection dexamethasone 10 mg . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect postoperative corticosteroid postoperative dysphagia follow TORS . II . Determine effect postoperative corticosteroid length hospital stay follow TORS . III . Determine complication associate postoperative corticosteroid use TORS . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously ( IV ) time surgery orally ( PO ) every 8 hour 4 day follow surgery . ARM II : Patients receive dexamethasone IV time surgery placebo PO every 8 hour 4 day follow surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
