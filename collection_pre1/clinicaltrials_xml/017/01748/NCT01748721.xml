	<brief_title>MORAb-004 Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose MORAb-004 ( anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004 ) administer intravenous infusion every week child refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity MORAb-004 administer schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics MORAb-004 child refractory cancer . IV . To monitor development human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) child receive MORAb-004 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity MORAb-004 within confines phase 1 study . II . To examine tumor endothelial marker-1 ( TEM-1 ) PDGFRB level tissue plasma sample potential biomarkers MORAb-004 activity . III . To correlate baseline expression TEM-1 PDGFRB ( issue plasma ) clinical parameter include disease response exploratory manner . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004 intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
