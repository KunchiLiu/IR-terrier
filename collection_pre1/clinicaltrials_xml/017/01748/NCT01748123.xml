	<brief_summary>- Clinical equipoise exist respect important question , `` What best initial diuretic treatment Hypertension '' ? A pragmatic comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) study compare Chlorthalidone Hydrochlorthiazide could help inform decision make common problem . - The investigator aim harness power bioinformatics ( use web-based data-capture electronic health record ) online medium ( collaboration ) order facilitate CER `` usual-care '' setting . This process may also provide foundation test wealth important clinical question commonly arise delivery contemporary healthcare would otherwise left unanswered . - To end investigator develop website , EBMtrialcentral , eligible physician go online join collaborative network . Physicians enroll eligible patient study . These include under-served urban patient . Clinical information enter online ( use secure database house Johns Hopkins ) , patient consent obtain electronically treatment recommendation randomly allocate either 25mg daily oral HCTZ 12.5mg daily oral Chlorthalidone . The investigator aim increase 50mg HCTZ 25mg Chlorthalidone 8 week compare effect BP measure 24 hour monitor . - The investigator ' primary hypothesis non-blinded , random , parallel allocation 12.5mg daily Chlorthalidone ( titrate 25mg 4 week ) demonstrate clinically meaningful ≥5mmHg improvement BP control ( measure change BP baseline use 24hr ABPM ) compare 25mg daily HCTZ ( titrate 50mg 4 week ) newly hypertensive patient follow usual-care clinic set 8 week . They also analyze difference side-effects safety ( serum electrolyte ) two medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EBMtrialcentral- Comparing Initial Diuretic Therapies Using Collaborative Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- BACKGROUND : The application many traditional randomized control trial ( RCT ) find real-world practice question . To end , comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) evolve . However , remain ample evidence U.S. trial become increasingly cumbersome expensive . Moreover , 90 percent fail meet enrollment goal . In contrast , significant recent technological advance bioinformatics social medium . However , thus-far , combine potential yet achieve field medicine . The stage set amalgamation three discipline ; CER , bioinformatics social medium . EBMtrialcentral non-profit website develop Johns Hopkins University idea use online social network actually perform CER trial . By harness power social medium , EBMtrialcentral could open world opportunity conduct clinical research bring randomization `` usual care '' . - OBJECTIVES : 1 . To determine social network website create , among group academic physician , pre-specified objective use website conduct CER trial . 2 . To perform pilot-study though website . This study randomly allocate initial anti-hypertensive treatment strategy , use guideline recommend diuretic agent . - METHODS : 1 . Website development-A test website , EBMtrialcentral.org , initiate . By visit website , eligible physician able join collaborative network . Once member physician identifies eligible patient agrees participate , consent form generate online formal enrollment . A therapeutic strategy randomly allocate via website . The investigator ' platform would require parsimonious imputation secure patient data . Follow-up pragmatic guideline-directed . Data initially manage protected online database run `` project REDCap '' . Patients patient advocate stakeholder invite help IRB website development . 2 . Pilot study-Despite strong evidence chlorthalidone , hypertensive patient prescribe diuretic currently receive HCTZ . However , two randomly compare adequately power study . The investigator require 80 newly hypertensive urban subject detect great 5mmHg mean automate BP difference two group 2 monthly follow-up visit ( 8 week total , standardized effect size 0.7 base prior data ) . The investigator include ethnic under-served subject . Exclusion criterion include compelling indication alternative anti-hypertensives . Non-blinded random allocation generate online .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman eligible hypertension , receive antihypertensive medication , average office BP value within last 6 month ≥140/90 mmHg . Patients hypertensive urgency exclude ( BP ≥180/120 mmHg ) . We also plan exclude `` compelling indication '' ACE inhibitor Betablocker therapy ( per JNC 7 ) . These include ; history diabetes ( prior HbA1c ≥6.5 % , fast glucose ≥126mg/dl , history insulin oral hypoglycemic use , microalbuminuria ) , myocardial infarction within last 3 year , know LVEF &lt; 50 % . Other safety exclusion ; history chronic kidney disease ( serum creatinine ≥1.8 mg/dL ) , know allergy study medication , inability provide consent , history significant noncompliance miss appointment , history poorlycontrolled gout history fall autonomic dysfunction subject age &lt; 21years ≥90yrs .</criteria>
