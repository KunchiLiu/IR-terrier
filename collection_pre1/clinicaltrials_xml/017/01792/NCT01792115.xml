	<brief_summary>Background : - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) excess accumulation fat liver cell . It associate obesity , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes . Some people NAFLD excess fat liver . However , people may develop bad form NAFLD liver injury scar . This form , call non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , lead liver failure , liver cancer , death . Not much know people develop NASH others . - Lifestyle change diet , exercise , weight loss decrease liver damage NAFLD . Some study show vitamin E also help treat NAFLD . The dose vitamin E use study almost 40 time recommended amount vitamin E intake food . It unclear whether low dose could achieve effect . Researchers also want study vitamin E work different dos treat NAFLD . Objectives : - To find effective dose vitamin E treat NAFLD . - To gain good understand NAFLD NASH develop , predict respond treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age suggestion non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - For first 12 week study , participant meet nutritionist . They personalize diet exercise plan . Treatment monitor diary questionnaire fill home . Participants also wear pedometer measure physical activity . - After 12-week period , participant full physical examination follow test : - Blood test - Glucose tolerance test - Imaging study ( DEXA scan magnetic resonance imaging ) - Liver fatty tissue biopsy - Two week test , participant start vitamin E treatment . They take two pill day , take fat-containing food . - 4 week start treatment repeat full evaluation imaging test , blood work , liver fat biopsy . - Participants take vitamin E take 120 week . They monitor visit every 8 12 week . At end 120 week , another full evaluation , image test , blood work , liver fat biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver With Different Doses Vitamin E</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common cause liver test abnormality western world , increasingly rise cause liver-related morbidity mortality . Vitamin E , fat-soluble anti-oxidant recently find effective treatment NAFLD ; however , mechanism action unclear . In controlled clinical trial vitamin E treatment show significantly reduce hepatic fat burden , suggest mechanism reduce oxidative stress involve . Furthermore , optimal dose vitamin E treat NAFLD unknown . We propose phase IIa study determine optimal dose vitamin E mechanism site action . In study aim enroll 90 patient NAFLD . Initially , patient undergo 12 week intensive lifestyle modification . Following , patient randomize treatment 3 different dos natural vitamin E ( rrr- -tocopherol 200 , 400 800 IU/d ) 24 week . The primary end point efficacy normalization liver enzymes reduction liver fat content magnetic resonance spectroscopy . Patients undergo liver adipose tissue biopsy vitamin E treatment 4 week therapy , biopsy sample use measure change gene expression marker oxidative stress . This coupled extensive phenotyping treatment use serological , radiological dynamic endocrine testing aim find dose-response characteristic vitamin E NAFLD , allow u understand mechanism action . After 24 week randomize treatment , patient switch dose 800 IU/ml continue treatment 30 month , end another liver biopsy perform . From phase ass effect dose increase vitamin E liver enzymes fat content , determine effect long-term treatment histological outcome .</detailed_description>
