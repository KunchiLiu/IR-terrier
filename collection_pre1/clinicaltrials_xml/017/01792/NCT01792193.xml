	<brief_summary>In previous work , investigator analyze concentration gut-derived peptide ( ghrelin , pancreatic polypeptide [ PP ] ) serum patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The investigator show secretion pattern differs PD patient control . Beside ghrelin pancreatic polypeptide gut-derived peptide ( e.g . Glucagon-like-Peptide 1 [ GLP-1 ] , Amylin , etc . ) might relevant PD well . The rational investigate gut-derived peptide neurological disorder Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) base follow consideration : - Receptors gut-derived peptide express Central Nervous System ( CNS ) structure affected neurodegenerative process underlie Parkinson 's disease - Gut-derived peptide involve modulation high brain function ( mood , cognition , reward-related behaviour ) frequently alter Parkinson 's disease . - The secretion gut peptide ( co- ) regulate vagal nerve dysfunctional Parkinson 's disease . - Certain gut-derived peptide ( ghrelin , GLP-1 ) stimulate neurogenesis might able prevent cell death neurodegenerative disorder , include Parkinson 's disease . Objective : Collection CSF serum sample standardize way order quantitatively measure concentration gut-derived peptide ( ghrelin , leptin , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [ GIP ] , GLP-1 , amylin , PP , peptide YY [ PYY ] , insulin ) . Scientific question : 1 . Do CSF ( serum ) concentration gut peptide differ PD patient control ? 2 . Do CSF ( serum ) concentration investigate peptide correlate clinical / epidemiological characteristic investigated subject ( age , gender , BMI , disease duration , severity motor impairment , presence non-motor symptom , co-morbidities , medication , etc . ) ?</brief_summary>
