	<brief_title>MR-Guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate oncologic efficacy laster interstitial thermal therapy ( LITT ) primary endpoint undetectable cancer magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -guided biopsy treatment zone 3 month follow treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate oncologic efficacy 12 month follow treatment base biopsy treatment zone . II . To determine treatment-related safety toxicity . III . To longitudinally assess urinary sexual function year follow treatment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo MR-guided LITT . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
