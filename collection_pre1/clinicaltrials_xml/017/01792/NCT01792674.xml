	<brief_summary>Care pregnant field unexpected emergency occur , however emergencies rare hence competence difficult learn . Therefore , relevant use simulation-based medical education . Many question simulation optimise learn remain unanswered . A major question simulation setting 'in situ simulation ' ( i.e . actual patient care unit ) versus 'off site simulation ' ( i.e . training room simulation center ) impact learn . Objectives : To study effect 'in situ simulation ' versus 'off site simulation ' learning outcome , safety-attitudes , team performance clinical performance simulate set plus stress motivational inducing effect simulation setting . Design : Randomised trial . Primary outcome : Written knowledge-test . Exploratory outcome : Safety Attitudes Questionnaire , team- clinical performance score , validate stress inventory , salivary cortisol , Intrinsic Motivation Inventory questionnaire perception simulation organisational change need . Perspective : To provide new knowledge contextual effect different simulation setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>'In Situ Simulation ' Versus 'Off Site Simulation ' Obstetric Emergencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Care pregnant deliver woman field unexpected emergency , example emergency caesarean sectio , postpartum bleed severe preeclampsia , may potentially harm mother baby , occur . Obstetric emergency rare hence nature difficult learn real life . Therefore , relevant simulation-based medical education , i.e. , train mannequin scenario . In non-systematic review conclude repetitive medical simulation associate improved learner outcome . However , many question simulation optimise learn emergency remain unanswered ; e.g. , different kind simulation setting 'in situ simulation ' versus 'off site simulation ' impact learn individual team level . Objectives : In randomised trial authentic obstetric-anaesthesia team study effect 'in situ simulation ' versus 'off site simulation ' participant learn outcome , safety-attitudes , team performance plus motivational stress induce effect different simulation setting potential association learn performance . Interventions : The experimental intervention training 'in situ simulation ' mean train actual patient care unit , situation labour suite operation theatre . The control group receive train 'off site simulation ' , i.e. , train room away actual patient care unit . In two different simulation setting , scenario conduct participant comprise authentic team specialise obstetrician obstetric trainee final training year , trainee obstetrician , midwife , auxiliary nurse , specialise anaesthetist anaesthesia trainee final training year , trainee anaesthetist , anaesthesia nurse , surgical nurse . Design trial size : Single-centre investigator-initiated randomise superiority trial . We choose calculate require sample size base experience knowledge test . We assume standard deviation 24 % , difference experimental control mean 17 % . With alpha set 0.05 , beta set 0.80 intraclass correlation 0,05 sample size add 93 participant . It plan include 100 participant . Outcomes : Primary outcome : 1 ) Knowledge write test multiple choice question . Exploratory outcome : 1 ) Safety Attitudes Questionnaire SAQ ) . 2 ) Team performance score measure Team Emergency Assessment Measure ( TEAM ) . 3 ) Clinical performance simulate set . 4 ) Salivary cortisol . 5 ) Validated stress inventory ( Stress-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI-1 ) cognitive appraisal ) . 6 ) Intrinsic Motivation Inventory ( IMI ) . 7 ) Questionnaire evaluate participant ' perception simulation , debrief , change need organisational level . Time schedule : 2 year start plan 1st April 2012 . Randomisation start approval Regional Ethics Committee Danish Data Protection Agency . The intervention 'in situ simulation ' versus 'on site simulation ' describe protocol schedule spring 2013 .</detailed_description>
