	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine effect two week daily dose inhale salt water mist ( hypertonic saline - HS ) actual measurement mucociliary cough clearance patient chronic bronchitis type Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD . Defective mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) central development and/or worsen several kind lung disease , include COPD/chronic bronchitis ( CB ) , cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , bronchiectasis . In case , defective MCC lead development lung infection damage airway ongoing inflammation cause person 's inability clear mucus lung . The investigator ' previous study show administration inhale HS ( hypertonic saline ) acutely accelerate MCC CF , also repetitive use `` reset '' baseline rate MCC within 2 week . It likely sustained effect HS MCC responsible ~60 % reduction frequency pulmonary disease exacerbation , reduce antibiotic use improve lung function long-term study HS CF volunteer . As result , HS become standard therapy CF lung disease success raise optimism similar benefit might occur patient CB . In study investigator use mildly radioactive particle , technetium bound sulfur colloid , measure compare sustain effect mucus clearance two week daily dose 7 % hypertonic saline versus low salt control treatment subject CB . We also collect sputum breath condensation analyze protein inflammatory change might occur exacerbation . Our long term goal improve understand MCC health disease develop good therapy support and/or restore MCC patient diseases reduce lung infection .</brief_summary>

Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) 3580 % predict , inclusive , FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 70 % 4 . Produces mucus least 2 day per week , average 5 . History smoking ( â‰¥ 10 pack year ) Volunteers exclude study meet follow criterion : 1 . Uses oxygen continuously daytime hour ( nighttime use OK ) 2 . Requires &gt; 10mg per day prednisone ( equivalent corticosteroid dose ) chronically 3 . Concomitant presence congestive heart failure , active coronary syndrome , disease opinion investigator would increase risk result participation 4 . Recent change respiratory medication , include acute antibiotic systemic corticosteroid intervention within last 4 week 5 . History intolerance hypersensitivity hypertonic saline short act inhaled beta agonist 6 . Significant broncho reactivity examination pulmonary function test ( PFT ) , opinion investigator would increase risk HS use 7 . Radiation exposure within 12 month prior study participation would cause exceed Federal Regulations participate study 8 . Subjects positive pregnancy test 9 . Subjects , opinion Principal Investigator , participate study Subjects may temporarily exclude screen experience respiratory tract infection require treatment antibiotic and/or steroid . They may become eligible screen four week complete treatment provide symptom resolve .</criteria>
