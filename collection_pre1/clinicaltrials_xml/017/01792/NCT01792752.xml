	<detailed_description>Study Design The overall goal project implement evaluate community-level , structure approach , `` Enhanced HIV Care Access Retention Intervention '' drug user San Juan , Puerto Rico . It bring HIV care directly five San Juan neighborhood high proportion HIV-positive injection drug user ( IDUs ) reside . The enhanced care intervention comprise 4 component : A ) neighborhood-level HIV Testing Campaign identify HIV-positive drug user aware HIV status , B ) Treatment Re-engagement Campaign use patient navigator out-of-care HIV-positive IDUs , C ) Patient Navigator Linkage Care Substance Abuse Treatment team newly diagnose care HIV-positive IDUs D ) Mobile HIV Care Clinic staff HIV clinician facilitate linkage retention care . The intervention evaluate use randomize roll-out design , refinement stepped-wedge design . The intervention rolled-out 6-month interval five neighborhood . The order neighborhood receive intervention determine randomly . Once neighborhood begin receive intervention , continue receive intervention throughout remain period study . The number individual serve intervention enter care , appointment adherence , viral load health service substance abuse treatment utilization document . The success intervention determine examine proportion virologic suppression time independent assessment cohort approximately 400 HIV-positive drug-using individual draw five neighborhood include intervention . The primary evaluation outcome study see whether intense saturation intervention result person assessment cohort offer receive intervention service impact viral load . Assessment Cohort Exposure intervention evaluate assessment cohort intervention strategy roll 5 intervention neighborhood . Eligible participant ( define ) schedule baseline appointment , ask bring documentation HIV status available . At baseline visit , participant : 1 ) review sign consent form ; 2 ) complete rapid HIV test ; 3 ) provide blood ass CBC ( include CD4 plasma HIV RNA ; 4 ) complete behavioral assessment use audio computer assist interview ( ACASI ) . Participants recruit assessment cohort counsel importance HIV care risk reduction practice follow exist standard within Puerto Rico . At end baseline visit , participant compensate time travel cost remind next scheduled visit six month 's time . Participants follow six month interval period 30 month ( 36 month neighborhood 5 ) . At assessment point ask complete behavioral assessment use ACASI blood drawn CD4 viral load .</detailed_description>
