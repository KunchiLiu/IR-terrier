	<brief_summary>The study 's purpose address challenge provide stage-appropriate chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) education care develop innovative program use CKD Patient Navigator system EHR ( electronic health record ) -based enhanced electronic communication system specific CKD patient her/his physicians/caregivers . The investigator plan randomize controlled trial innovation examine utility effectiveness special intervention . The investigator ' CKD registry aid identify patient recruitment randomize control trial . Patients randomize one four group . The four group : 1 ) control group use MyChart ; 2 ) enhance personal health record ( PHR ) include MyChart consist 35 website choose disseminate CKD stage-specific goal care CKD education ; 3 ) patient navigator , lay professional trained specific chronic kidney disease navigation focus need patient base National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ; 4 ) patient navigator combine enhanced MyChart . The investigator hypothesize CKD Patient Navigator program develop prepare , proactive patient-caregiver team usual care ; enhance PHR produce inform , engage patient usual care ; CKD Patient Navigator arm enhance PHR demonstrate slow rate decline eGFR ( glomerular filtration rate ) usual care . The result study lay foundation large multi-center national clinical trial build upon feasibility knowledge gain plan grant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal research ass effect innovative intervention CKD decline renal function among patient CKD stag 3b 4 . First , CKD Patient Navigator program create , adapt use Patient Navigators successfully oncology . Second , enhance PHR develop use electronic communication disseminate CKD stage-specific goal care CKD education . Third , randomize control trial conduct use factorial design investigate clinical impact cost-effectiveness two intervention - CKD Patient Navigator enhance PHR compare usual care CKD Stage 3b/4 patient . As conceptual framework propose study , investigator use Chronic Care Model develop Edward H. Wagner , M.D. , Director The MacColl Institute Healthcare Innovation , Director The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation national program `` Improving Chronic Illness Care '' Senior Investigator Group Health Research Institute Seattle . The model emphasize synergy community , health care system , technology personal interaction achieve optimal functional clinical outcome among people chronic disease . It adopt National Kidney Disease Education Program ( NKDEP ) achieve many goal relate kidney disease . With help CKD registry , investigator recruit patient outpatient clinic main campus family health center locate surround Cleveland area . Patients recruit trained study coordinator . All patient inform study procedure purpose research , verbally write informed consent document , two copy must sign patient study coordinator enrollment . Upon enrollment , patient provide $ 25 stipend . The investigator identify CKD Registry recruit eligible patient CKD stage 3b ( eGFR 30-44 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) Stage 4 ( eGFR 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . The majority data come EHR derive CKD registry . The investigator obtain baseline demographic characteristic ( age , gender , race ) , comorbidities , medication use , smoke status baseline visit . Further , CKD stage specific laboratory data collect routinely i.e. , whether laboratory parameter measure measure , whether laboratory measure blood pressure target limit . Details nephrology , vascular access , transplant referral obtain baseline visit . The primary outcome study change eGFR two-year study period .</detailed_description>
