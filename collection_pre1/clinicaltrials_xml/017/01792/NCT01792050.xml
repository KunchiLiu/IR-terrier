	<brief_title>Study Chemotherapy Combination With IDO Inhibitor Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 232,340 US woman diagnose 40,030 woman die breast cancer 2013 . Metastatic breast cancer terminal condition treatment palliative nature . The median survival patient metastatic breast cancer approximately 2.5 year . The standard therapy currently use include anti-estrogen therapy ( anastrazole , letrozole , fulvestrant , tamoxifen ) , chemotherapy agent ( taxanes , capecitabine , navelbine , gemcitabine , eribulin , ixabepilone ) , target therapy ( trastuzumab , lapatinib ) , supportive care agent ( zolendronic acid , denosumab ) . While breast cancer typically respond well treatment , response transient disease become refractory continued therapy . Also , quality life significant issue patient many therapy associate significant side effect . Well tolerate , novel agent improve efficacy exist chemotherapy agent would prove quite useful manage metastatic breast cancer . Preclinical data derive MMTV-Neu mouse autochthonous tumor study interaction indoximod various chemotherapeutic agent . Mice 5-10mm tumor enrol control treatment group . Mice treat indoximod alone , chemotherapy alone ( paclitaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , others ) , combination indoximod chemotherapy . treatment indoximod paclitaxel alone cause retardation tumor growth model regression see . combination indoximod plus paclitaxel cause 30 % tumor regression histologically significantly enhanced tumor cell death combination versus either agent alone . This synergism abrogate mice underwent CD4+ T cell depletion prior treatment combination , suggest immune response play role observed effect . Based data report suggest systemic immunomodulating drug like indoximod synergize chemotherapy agent taxanes , decision make devise combination therapy docetaxel paclitaxel indoximod metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm estrogen/progesterone receptor ( ER/PR ) +/ ; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , metastatic breast cancer . Metastatic disease evaluable imaging . May measureable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Patients also nonmeasurable disease include bone metastatic disease , evaluate bone scan , PET MRI . Any number prior endocrine therapy metastatic setting allow . The patient must receive prior chemotherapy agent metastatic setting . Prior treatment adjuvant docetaxel paclitaxel allow disease relapse occur great 12 month completion adjuvant therapy . Age ≥18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤1 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) . Life expectancy great 4 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL , absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL , platelets ≥100,000/mcL , total bilirubin within normal institutional limit , aspartate aminotransferase AST ( SGOT ) / alanine aminotransferase ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal , creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Patients know brain metastasis eligible tumor treat definitive resection and/or radiotherapy neurologically stable least 1 month steroid . Male female subject child produce potential must agree use adequate form contraception avoidance pregnancy measure prior study entry , enrol study minimum one month completion study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy treatment metastatic breast cancer eligible . Patients radiotherapy within 3 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier eligible . Patients currently receive investigational agent . Patients know active , untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . Those previously treat inactive brain metastasis evidence active disease document brain MRI least 4 week radiation steroid may eligible . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition docetaxel tryptophan contain substance . This would include Ltryptophan 5hydroxytryptophan supplement . Also patient history severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 exclude . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study indoximod immunoregulatory agent potential abortifacient effect due fetal rejection maternal immune system . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother indoximod , breastfeed discontinue mother treated indoximod . Also , docetaxel paclitaxel category D cytotoxic agent administer pregnant female . Known HIVpositive patient acquired/inherited immunodeficiency ineligible due possibility affect response indoximod high risk active opportunistic infection . Patients one active malignancy time enrollment . Patients receive prior experimental active immunotherapy consist target monoclonal antibody ( ipilimumab ) pharmaceutical compound exclude . Patients active autoimmune disease ( i.e . psoriasis , extensive atopic dermatitis , asthma , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , multiple sclerosis ( M.S . ) , uveitis , vasculitis ) , chronic inflammatory condition , condition require concurrent use systemic immunosuppressant steroid reason would exclude study . Any patient allotransplant kind would exclude well . This would include xenograft heart valve avoid potential risk immune reaction cause valvular degeneration . Mildintermittent asthma require occasional betaagonist inhaler use mild localized eczema exclude .</criteria>
