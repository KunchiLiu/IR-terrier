	<brief_summary>The study intend collect specimen support application genome analysis technology , include large-scale genome sequencing . This study ultimately provide cancer researcher specimens use develop comprehensive catalog genomic information least 50 type human cancer . The study create resource available worldwide research community could use identify accelerate development new diagnostic prognostic marker , new target pharmaceutical intervention , new cancer prevention treatment strategy . This study competitive enrollment study conduct multiple institution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Collection Surplus Surgical Tumor Tissues Pre-surgical Blood Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enroll subject diagnose various cancer schedule undergo surgical treatment . Prior schedule surgery , subject ask donate 10-20 ml blood sample . After surgery , surplus tissue ( include tumor adjacent normal tissue ) require diagnosis collect . Subject clinical information collect , include basic demographic information , medical history , family history , current cancer history treatment . After surgery , final pathology report obtain subject 's surgical specimen . In instance base cancer indication require , longitudinal data may also collect frequency every 6 month per year . Longitudinal data include information study subject survival disease recurrence .</detailed_description>
