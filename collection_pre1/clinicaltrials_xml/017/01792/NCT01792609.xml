	<detailed_description>The MIMO Study Group propose conduct prospective randomize control trial order determine whether low implant density cohort equivalent clinical radiographic result high implant density cohort . This study propose trial equivalence . The null hypothesis significant difference exist percent major Cobb angle correction high- low-implant density cohort Lenke 1A curve type , common scoliotic curve pattern ( 73 ) . Consecutive qualify patient screen enrolled high-volume spine surgeon 14 site randomize spinal instrumentation low- high-density screw pattern . Patients return 3-months , 1-year , 2-years exam , radiograph , collection patient-reported outcome score . The Harms Study Group Foundation serve collaborate organization provide database development management , secure online data collection , centralize radiographic measurement , data quality control . The University Minnesota team lead study design , protocol development , IRB/data use agreement contract , patient randomization , statistical analysis , include quarterly data review . Imaging obtain either EOS system use calibration belt radiograph , allow subsequent 3D model deformity . Six enrol site currently capability ( EOS - Montreal , St. Louis , Iowa , Mayo , DuPont , San Diego ) . An additional five site already calibration belt - Dallas , New York , Baltimore , Boston , U. Rochester ) , new calibration belt fabricate additional site . The Montreal site supervise collection radiographic data 3D capability assist troubleshoot radiographic quality control . Although study primarily power detect change percent correction major coronal curve , preliminary data gather axial sagittal plane correction well complication , surgical factor , patient-reported outcome .</detailed_description>
