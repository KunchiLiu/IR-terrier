	<brief_summary>TARGIT-Boost international randomise clinical trial design test hypothesis tumour bed boost deliver single dose target intraoperative radiotherapy ( TARGIT-B ) superior conventional course external beam radiotherapy boost ( EBRT-Boost ) , especially woman high risk local recurrence . It pragmatic trial participate centre use local predefined inclusion/exclusion criterion entry trial . Only centre access Intrabeam® ( Carl Zeiss ) eligible enter patient trial . Eligible patient high risk local recurrence breast conserving surgery . After give consent patient randomise either TARGIT Boost EBRT Boost . All patient receive whole breast EBRT . They may receive adjuvant treatment deem necessary . The protocol recommend patient follow six monthly interval three year annually . The primary endpoint ipsilateral breast recurrence rate . Secondary endpoint relapse-free survival , site recurrence , overall survival ( breast-cancer specific non-breast cancer death ) patient satisfaction quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Intra-operative Radiotherapy Boost With External Beam Radiotherapy Boost Early Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN : A pragmatic multi-centre randomise clinical trial test whether TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy tumour bed Boost ( TARGIT-B ) superior term local relapse within treat breast compare standard post-operative external beam radiotherapy boost woman undergo breast conserve therapy high risk local recurrence . Patients enter primary surgery small proportion case , post-pathology . SETTING : Specialist breast unit UK , USA , Canada , Australia Europe ; 31 centre currently recruit TARGIT-A trial several ready join . TARGET POPULATION : Breast cancer patient suitable breast conserving surgery , high risk local recurrence . Details inclusion exclusion give part 2 . Briefly patient either young 45 old , need certain pathological feature confer high risk local recurrence breast cancer . HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BEING ASSESSED . The TARGIT Technique : The Intrabeam® ( Carl Zeiss , FDA approve CE mark ) miniature electron beam-driven source provide point source low energy X-rays ( 50kV maximum ) tip 3.2mm diameter tube . The radiation source insert tumour bed immediately excision tumour switch 20-35 minute provide intra-operative radiotherapy accurately target tissue high risk local recurrence . The physic , dosimetry early clinical application soft x-ray device well study . For use breast , technique first develop pilot University College London . The radiation source surround spherical applicator , specially design ( available various size ) produce uniform field radiation surface , enable delivery accurately calculate dose prescribed depth . It insert tumour bed appose surgical suture and/or mean . As x-rays rapidly attenuate dose distant tissue reduce ; also allow use standard operating theatre . 20 Gy deliver tumour bed surface 20-35 minute , radiation switch , applicator remove , wound close normal way . This simple technique potentially several advantage convential external beam radiotherapy , interstitial implantation radioactive wire conformal external beam radiotherapy . The first pilot twenty-five case perform UCL use TARGIT technique replacement boost dose radiotherapy ; full dose external beam treatment subsequently give . The phase II study 300 patient publish recently update long term data along favourable toxicity cosmetic outcome result individual cohort . A mathematical model TARGIT develop recently ( funded Cancer Research UK ) suggest could superior conventional radiotherapy . Translational research find TARGIT impairs surgical-trauma-stimulated proliferation invasiveness breast cancer cell . This effect radiotherapy may act synergistically tumouricidal effect yield superior result . MEASUREMENT OF COST AND OUTCOME : Patient assessment clinical examination ( 6 monthly x 3 year yearly x 10 year ) mammography ( yearly ) . ulstrasound ( need ) . Primary outcome : histologically/cytologically proven local recurrence . Secondary : site relapse breast , overall survival , local toxicity ( RTOG LENT SOMA criterion ) , cosmesis , quality life , patient satisfaction health economics . The cost cost-effectiveness TARGIT versus EBRT , boost , calculate NHS personal social service ( PSS ) perspective . Costs directly incur patient also assesed , since EBRT boost likely impose additional time travel expense patient family .</detailed_description>

Lobular carcinoma Extensive Intraductal Component ( EIC ) 6 . A list ( one many ) high risk factor present ( predefined policy document ) give high risk local recurrence . 7 . Patients either HER2 positive HER2 negative include . 1 . Bilateral breast cancer time diagnosis . 2 . Patients severe concomitant disease may limit life expectancy 3 . Previous history malignant disease preclude entry expectation relapsefree survival 10 year 90 % great ( e.g. , nonmelanoma skin cancer , CIN , etc ) . 4 . No 30 day elapse last breast cancer surgery ( axillary ) randomisation patient postpathology stratification unless part specific clinical trial address question time tumour bed reliably identify , e.g. , ultrasound .</criteria>
