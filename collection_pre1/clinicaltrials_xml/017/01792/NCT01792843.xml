	<brief_title>Cognitive Phenotypes Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment frequent PD , even non-demented patient . However , substantial heterogeneity clinical presentation cognitive deficit PD 2 also progression . This heterogeneity possibly reflect diversity neuronal damage cause disease recent study suggest different clinical influence risk develop dementia . Most study cognitive phenotype PD use predefined category , demented vs. non-demented , PD-mild cognitive impairment vs. cognitively intact patient . However , approach may miss less obvious unexpected presentation . To end , first part study , use data-driven approach ( cluster analysis ) identify different cognitive phenotype PD . With approach phenotypical profile arise data without priori assumption , five cognitive presentation identify : i° ) cognitively intact patient ( 19.39 % ) , ii° ) patient slight mental slow mild executive dysfunction ( 41.29 % ) , iii° ) patient slightly impair overall cognitive efficiency deficit cognitive domain except recognition memory ( 12.93 % ) , iv° ) patient severe mental slowing , impair overall cognitive efficiency , severe cognitive impairment domain , include memory ( 23.88 % ) , v° ) patient severe impairment cognitive domain ( 2.51 % ) . From result , could hypothesize cognitive deterioration PD progress along continuum , exception fourth group also exhibit memory deficit . This group may characterize different underlie pathology , comorbidity Alzheimer 's disease . The role vascular factor also consider . The objective current project : 1. validate identify cognitive profile prospectively new population use confirmatory cluster analysis . 2. identify specific anatomical correlate identify cognitive profile magnetic resonance-imaging ( MRI ) scan 3. identify specific functional correlate identify cognitive profile high-density EEG ( hd-EEG )</detailed_description>
