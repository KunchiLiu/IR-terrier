	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2A Study Minerval Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , non-randomized study patient advance solid tumour include malignant glioma . The study perform two phase - dose escalation phase follow standard `` 3+3 '' design establish dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) safe dose 2-OHOA follow two expand safety cohort ( approximately 10 malignant glioma approximately 10 advance solid tumour suitable biopsy ) treat maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . If MTD well tolerate expand safety cohort , dose becomes recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . During dose cohort , least one week must elapse first subsequent patient receive treatment 2-OHOA . Patients may receive palliative localize radiotherapy , need ( however , lesion target lesion evaluation treatment response ) . Safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics efficacy evaluate study pre-defined timepoints</detailed_description>
