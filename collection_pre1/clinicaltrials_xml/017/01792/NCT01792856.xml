	<brief_title>Coaching Intervention Patients With Early Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background , current evidence key reference Psychotic disorder include schizophrenia severe mental illness affect 3 % population constitute enormous burden patient society . They cause profound disruption patient ' function include independent living skill , relationship , scholastic vocational development , rank World Health Organization third disable medical condition . In attempt minimize long-term disability , numerous early intervention ( EI ) program psychosis establish worldwide past decade . It base premise shorten treatment delay provision phase-specific treatment initial year psychosis improve illness outcome . Literature indicate patient receive EI well clinical functional outcome treat standard psychiatric care . Nonetheless , accumulate evidence suggest significant proportion early psychosis patient exhibit functional deterioration even presence clinical remission . Studies also consistently show patient psychosis frequently experience motivational deficit diminish goal-directed behaviour key negative symptom predictive functional outcome . Functional disability thus represent unmet therapeutic need EI psychosis . In regard , shift therapeutic focus symptom control functional enhancement . It also increasingly recognize patient ' perspective take consideration conceptualize functional recovery develop recovery-oriented service improve functional outcome . Owing lack effective treatment address functional impairment , recently , emerge interest adopt life coach complement intervention specific focus motivation functioning . Life coach defined collaborative , solution-focused , outcome-oriented systematic process aim facilitate enhancement life experience goal attainment individual various life domain . It base theoretical framework positive psychology behavioural change model , target build individual 's potential via foster hope , motivation , self-efficacy self-regulation . The principle life coach thus closely align recovery orientation emphasize self-initiation empowerment via person-centred strength-based approach . In fact , empirical evidence suggest hopelessness low self-efficacy associate poor function early psychosis . Conversely , increase motivation show enhance functional cognitive outcome schizophrenia . Additionally , study evaluate coach non-clinical population find significantly improve subject ' motivation psychological wellbeing . Despite grow recognition adoption life coach approach mental health service , rarely apply early course psychotic disorder . Jockey Club Early Psychosis ( JCEP ) project territory-wide specialized EI service launch August 2009 provide 3-year phase-specific intervention adult patient present first-episode psychosis ( FEP ) psychiatric unit Hospital Authority ( HA ) . To promote early functional recovery , JCEP project develop recovery-oriented intervention base life coach approach ( recovery-oriented coaching ) addition case management . This structured , group-based coaching program incorporate cognitive-behavioural solution-focused therapeutic component . The program facilitate patient undergo active change process via identification achievable goal , formulation action plan , provision feedback progress monitoring goal attainment . Unlike majority therapy focus mainly symptoms functional deficiency , program strength-oriented aim facilitate patient gain sense agency achieve sustain functional improvement via firstly , enhance motivation , self-regulation competence positive reinforcement obtain successive accomplishment self-determined goal ; secondly , provide autonomy-supportive treatment environment context recovery expectation ; thirdly , facilitate formation supportive social network group-based setting . We previously examine perception early psychosis patient recovery , achievement adequate functioning regard key element signify recovery . Our early study FEP patient EI reveal less one-fifth achieve recovery 43 % remitted patient functional remission end 3-year follow-up . Thus , line literature , finding indicate urgent need develop effective intervention optimize patient ' functional outcome early illness stage otherwise regard critical window opportunity minimize long-term disability . In context , recovery-oriented coaching program specifically address motivational functional impairment may prove effective psychosocial intervention promote functional recovery , thereby worthy systematic evaluation patient early psychosis .</detailed_description>
