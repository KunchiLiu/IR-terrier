	<brief_summary>Hand psoriasis/eczema common problem characterize itchy , erythematous scaly lesion often long last relapse course . Treatment difficult considerable number patient partially respond current treatment . Several study show therapeutic effectiveness combination topical psoralen long wavelength ultraviolet A radiation ( PUVA ) treat hand psoriasis/eczema . Topical PUVA several short- long-term side effect . Narrow band ultraviolet B ( NB-UVB ) emerge recently important treatment variety photoresponsive disease include psoriasis eczema . For condition ( hand psoriasis/eczema ) NB-UVB show similar therapeutic result PUVA less side effect . There study publish efficacy NB-UVB hand psoriasis/eczema .

	<brief_title>Topical Psoralen Ultraviolet Light A Versus Narrow Band Ultraviolet Light B Treatment Recalcitrant Dermatoses Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hand dermatoses common problem characterize itchy , erythematous scaly lesion often long last relapse course . Patients present severe cutaneous change classify severe recalcitrant hand dermatosis . Treatment difficult considerable number patient partially respond current treatment . Current treatment regimens mainly involve use high potency topical corticosteroid , limited affect . Systemic treatment modality utilize serious side effect limit improvement disease . Several study show therapeutic effectiveness combination topical psoralen long wavelength ultraviolet A radiation ( PUVA ) treat hand dermatosis . Topical PUVA commonly associate mild local sunburn reaction often necessitate temporarily withhold treatment decrease light dose . This subsequently lead delay response prolongation treatment . Long term side effect include age skin , hyperpigmentation , small increase risk skin cancer common systemic PUVA . Narrow band ultraviolet B ( NB-UVB ) emerge recently important treatment variety photoresponsive disease include psoriasis eczema . For condition ( hand psoriasis/eczema ) NB-UVB show similar therapeutic result PUVA less side effect . There study publish efficacy NB-UVB hand psoriasis/eczema . Our hypothesis NB-UVB topical PUVA result least comparable improvement hand psoriasis/eczema less side effect associate NB-UVB . We plan conduct prospective single-blind randomize clinical trial compare efficacy safety topical PUVA NB-UVB treat hand psoriasis/eczema . Study Objectives 1 . To compare effect topical PUVA NB-UVB visual cutaneous symptom patient present recalcitrant hand dermatosis . 2 . To compare side effect profile topical PUVA NB-UVB treat patient recalcitrant hand dermatosis .</detailed_description>
