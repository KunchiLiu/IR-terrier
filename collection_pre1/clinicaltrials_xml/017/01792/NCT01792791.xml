	<brief_summary>Arthritis nation 's common cause disability . An estimated 50 million U.S. adult ( 1 5 ) report doctor-diagnosed arthritis . Twenty three million U.S. adult work age ( 18-64 year ) arthritis ; age group arthritis-attributable work limitation affect 1 3 people . An estimated 12 % patient seek intervention symptomatic arthritis etiology previous trauma involve joint . The purpose study examine inflammatory compound joint fluid ( synovial fluid ) , joint lining ( synovium ) , blood among subject isolate intra-articular fracture . The hypothesis early level intra-articular inflammation marker joint tissue degeneration follow articular fracture human knee predictive development PTA ( Post Traumatic Arthritis ) . Early level intra-articular inflammation marker joint tissue degeneration identify human knee joint follow articular injury predictive development PTA mouse knee . Samples blood , urine synovial fluid take span frame surgery synovial fluid ORIF ( Open Reduction Internal Fixation ) surgery . Two MRIs ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) part study 4 week 18 months.Participants complete set questionnaire ( KOOS : Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ) 4 week 18 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-traumatic Arthritis Associated With Joint Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 patient close unilateral articular fracture knee require operative treatment enrol 18 month period . Tissue sample include synovial fluid injured contralateral knee , serum urine collect pre-operatively time frame ORIF . If patient need one surgery ( ORIF ) sample collect . MRI image injured knee obtain fixation week 6 8 18 month . Tissue sample analyze established biomarkers joint inflammation degradation . Patients follow 18 month assess sign post-traumatic arthritis . Imaging plain film MRI occur 18 month . MRI image analysis cartilage thickness composition change assess injured knee . Assessment articular cartilage joint space narrow KOOS correlate biomarkers may indicative predictive joint degeneration development PTA .</detailed_description>
