	<brief_summary>Endoscopic cholangiography procedure perform image bile duct perform therapy like removal bile duct stone . It currently standard care remove stone bile duct find frequently cause complication like infection sometime life threaten . Therapy biliary tree , like example stone removal , frequently require inserting tool open duct cut muscle control secretion juice liver . Cutting muscle help secure easy access bile duct . It also help facilitate drag stone . On certain occasion place wire bile duct fail instead wire keep enter pancreatic duct whose opening adjacent bile duct opening . There evidence suggest keep wire pancreatic duct facilitates place second wire bile duct possibly straighten duct . On certain occasion also fail resort cut muscle pancreas bile duct simultaneously facilitate access bile duct . The attempt enter bile duct high risk inflammation pancreas know pancreatitis . This make decrease number attempt place wire duct desirable . One way facilitate placement wire bile duct cut start open pancreas duct aim toward bile duct muscle . This often cut bile duct sphincter expose bile duct opening . The study try answer cut bile duct sphincter muscle direction bile duct immediately wire enter pancreatic duct make easy place wire bile duct compare try place wire bile duct without cut opening . While cut muscle canincrease risk pancreatitis , repeat attempt access bile duct also increase risk pancreatitis . So cut pancreatic muscle facilitate entry bile duct decrease number attempt enter bile duct might better way approach patient difficulty enter bile duct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT Double Wire Technique With Without Transpancreatic Sphincterotomy Difficult Common Bile Duct Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , non blind randomize control trial . We screen offer enrollment patient present Mayo Clinic Arizona ERCP native papilla indication cholangiography sphincterotomy . Informed consent obtain preoperative area obtain consent ERCP . We randomize patient fail deeply cannulate CBD use sphincterotome ( Autotome , Boston Scientific ) 0.035 '' guidewire ( 0.035 '' Jagwire Dreamwire , Boston Scientific ) 5 minute 5 attempt wire pass stable configuration Pancreatic duct ( PD ) . We exclude patient contraindication undergo ERCP , contraindication sphincterotomy ( e , g , , abnormal anatomy , uncorrectable coagulopathy ) pancreas divisum . Patients randomize 1:1 use opaque envelope block 4 stratified gender . ( Gender stratification necessary risk ERCP vis pancreatitis different male female ) . In randomized DWT group , PD wire leave place , catheter remove reinserted next PD wire second wire attempt CBD cannluation previously describe ( 1 ) . In randomized TPS , pancreatic sphincterotomy perform sphincterotome . The catheter remove PD wire leave place . The catheter second wire insert CBD cannluation attempt DWT group . All patient receive 5Fr pancreatic stent indomethacin 100 mg rectally reduce risk pancreatitis per standard care ( patient contraindication NSAIDs ( e.g. , sensitivity Indomethacin , aspirin class , active peptic ulcer disease ) receive Indomethacin . Patients fail DWT ( least 10 minute 10 attempt ) may cross TPS endoscopist 's discretion . Further care patient receive standard care . We contact patient around month later telephone ask procedure relate complication report u . outcome measure assess day 1 end procedure day 30 .</detailed_description>
