	<brief_summary>The investigator investigate effect combine exposure diesel exhaust allergen lung function immune system . After expose individual either filter air carefully control level diesel exhaust exposure chamber , The investigator use procedure call bronchoscopy ( whereby thin , flexible tube pass throat lung ) place small amount allergen directly lung . 48h later , bronchoscopy repeat sample collect lung . After 1mo , entire procedure repeat alternate exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose/Objective : To study effect diesel exhaust particle lung function allergic response . 2 . Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : DE exposure augments systemic oxidative stress allergen challenge allergen-sensitized individual . Hypothesis 2 : DE exposure augment allergen-specific immune response allergen-challenged airway sensitize individual . These response great asthmatic individual non-asthmatics . 3 . Justification : The use diesel engine increase fuel-efficient gasoline engine . However , diesel engine produce different emission gasoline engine . Diesel exhaust emit tailpipe `` on-road '' diesel engine vehicle ( diesel car , bus truck ) `` non-road '' diesel engine ( locomotive , marine vessel construction equipment ) . Diesel exhaust consist gaseous particulate air pollutant . Since people asthma allergic disease appear sensitive air pollution , would like know diesel exhaust ( DE ) affect respiratory immune system . We expect response may occur detectable careful examination cell tissue ( e.g. , bronchoalveolar lavage ( fluid lung ) , blood , urine ) . Understanding potentially subtle change help u prevent health problem associate air pollution future . 4 . Research Method : This blind crossover experiment two condition ( DE filter air , FA ) , randomize counter-balanced order . Data collection condition separate 4-week washout period . Following exposure , The investigator use bronchoscopy ( perform Vancouver General Hospital Endoscopy Suite ) deliver diluent-controlled segmental allergen challenge ( SAC ) . 24 h post-SAC , airway reactivity assess methacholine challenge . 48 h post-SAC , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , airway brush tissue biopsy obtain region analysis immune activation . Nasal lavage sample also collect examine response upper airway blood urine study examine systemic response . Spirometry methacholine challenge use assess effect airway function</detailed_description>
