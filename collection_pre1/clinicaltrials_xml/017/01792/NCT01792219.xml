	<brief_title>Interprofessional Collaboration Health Care Outcomes Nursing Homes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction The extent different health care professional work together affect quality health care provide . Government body organization different medical paramedical profession emphasize importance interprofessional collaboration health care ( IPCIHC ) . It assume model work together particular attention process professional develop integrated cohesive answer need client/family/population . The outcome rather difficult evaluate therefore important understand effectiveness intervention aim improve IPCIHC improve quality care . Despite large number publication interprofessional collaboration , high quality research , evidence rigorous evaluation need support decision maker . It especially require specific conclusion certain population context drawn . The age population expect major driver increase demand long-term care service . Delivery health care population require high level coordinate teamwork effort provide good quality care . But quality care ? To assess 'quality care ' first define depend whether one assess performance practitioner also contribution patient health care system . As described American Medical Association , quality care `` care consistently contribute improvement maintenance quality and/or duration life '' . Donabedian conceptualized quality care inter-related structure , process outcome component . Structured example 'staffing ' , process action patient example restraint . And outcome indicator assess patient 's end result example fall . Interprofessional collaboration intervention seem result positive effect health care outcome . Nevertheless need concrete information effect interprofessional collaboration chronic geriatric patient . Overall positive effect interprofessional collaboration intervention chronic geriatric care mainly find outcomes fall incidence , transition , quality life , medication change cost . 2 . Research question What effect learn collaborate accord interprofessional model healthcare process outcomes chronic geriatric patient nurse home ? 3 . Study objectives 3.1 Primary objective To investigate effectiveness learn interprofessional collaborate quality indicator 'care safety ' ( fall incidence , medication , hospital visit ) quality indicator 'caregivers care organization ' ( absenteeism ) . 3.2 Second objective To investigate effectiveness learn interprofessional collaborate level intensity care knowledge interprofessional collaboration work model . 3.3 Third objective To investigate effectiveness learn interprofessional collaborate chronic geriatric patient level health-related quality life , independence cognitive functioning . 4 Study design The investigator set cluster randomize control trial primary health care aim investigate effectiveness train interprofessional collaboration . Patient orient outcome assess chronic geriatric patient nurse home , include pre-post assessment intervention short long term follow-up . Eligible nursing home invite participate study intervention group control group . When informed consent receive , baseline measurement perform . The nursing home randomly allocate control intervention group . Data collection resident perform researcher assistant blind allocation , involve data analysis . For control group data gather baseline 12 month . For intervention group data gather baseline , measurement do 6 month 12 month point . All data manage researcher involve data analysis . After allocation , research team discus allocation specific measurement schedule management board nursing home . Once schedule agree management board research team , nurse home personnel also receive allocation specific information . All personnel ask actively participate study ask informed consent . Finally , also eligible resident nurse home receive allocation specific information ask informed consent . The intervention consist educational module title 'to learn collaborate interprofessionally ' . The intervention concern two educational module . The first module ( module 1 ) 10 hour course . It problem-based interactive learning method real life case . This first module concern definition , get know ( discipline ) , make care plan , discus ethical case , reflect competence 'interprofessional collaborator ' finally present reflection feedback . Also second module ( module 2 ) 10 hour course . In module 2 important get personal level . Small team form . The team guide tutor/educator . In 3 session 3 hour participate professional reflect upon competence collaborator check learnt . Also module bottle neck collaboration collect tutor/educator . The intervention take place nurse home need logistic issue take place University Antwerp . In last session one hour team member present insight gain session collaborator . Finally formulate learn goal future . In study quality care describe population term healthcare process outcome express choose outcome ( macro , meso micro level ) interrelation . The investigator aware fact outcomes quality care measure specific population . So investigator chose basis literature discussion expert outcomes . The main hypothesis study : intervention effect quality care chronic geriatric patient nurse home .</detailed_description>
