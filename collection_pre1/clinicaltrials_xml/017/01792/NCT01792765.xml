	<brief_summary>Kidney stone common , inflict significant degree pain renal damage . Some stone become obstructed ureter , tube drain kidney . In order remove stone , Urologist team use fluoroscopic guidance , involve continuous X-ray . Flouroscopy delivers significant dose radiation patient , well health care team , show serious health consequence . Previous study show certain population , like pregnant woman , stone manage use ultrasound guidance . The investigator propose mid distal ureteral stone could manage use ultrasound guidance conjunction conventional stone removal technique ( ureteroscopy , lithotripsy , ureteral stent placement ) , lieu fluoroscopy , thereby minimize radiation healthcare staff patient . The investigator hypothesize distal ureteral stone identify efficiently fragment remove ultrasound guidance safe effective manner without use radiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Ureteral Calculi Using Ultrasound Guidance : A Radiation Free Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol consent study Urology Clinic Dartmouth Hitchcock Memorial Hospital randomize prospectively fluoroscopic versus ultrasound guide group . A computer randomization program use randomize patient test control group . Randomization take place consent participate study , case book accordingly . Consent participate study obtain patient 's followup appointment . At time initial clinical encounter provide consent form information regard study . Once chance look contact whether would consent study . If , randomize consent form sign morning procedure . Each group consist 25 patient . This pilot group size determine base feasibility recruitment study period funding availability . All patient receive preoperative antibiotic select accordance previous urine culture sensitivity respective allergy applicable . Intraoperatively , patient place dorsal lithotomy position . All patient general anesthesia , treatment arm , standard care . All procedure begin standard cystourethroscopy , removal previous ureteral stent , passage wire proximally renal pelvis . The ultrasound group undergo intraoperative transabdominal ultrasonography designate ultrasonographer , presence wire , later ureteral stent , within renal pelvis confirm via ultrasound patient . The control group undergo standard verification wire stent placement via fluoroscopy . Operative time well radiation fluoroscopy time record compare two group . At institution , procedure schedule 140 minute OR time base previous experience group individual surgeon . Stone free rate determine one month post operatively KUB renal ultrasound compare group . Intraoperatively , concern poor visualization , lack progress , technical difficulty relate use intraoperative ultrasound , safety concern , technique abandon conventional fluoroscopy use patient group . This apparent first 15 - 30 minute procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Selection criterion include adult patient mid distal ureteral stone â‰¤8mm , stented prior present intervention . Ureteral stenting prior ureteroscopy standard Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center , test control group stented two week prior procedure . Initial ureteral stenting perform use conventional fluoroscopy discretion surgeon may acute set within scope trial . The mid distal portion ureter refers segment ureter extend upper portion sacrum distally bladder . Patients exclude trial surgical resection involve bladder ureter , history know ureteral stricture . Also , adult patient ( &gt; 18yo ) .</criteria>
