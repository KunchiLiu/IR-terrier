	<brief_title>Increasing Physical Activity Stroke Survivors Using STARFISH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Stroke one lead cause long-term disability western country ( Donan et al . 2008 ) . Stroke survivor often deconditioned predisposed sedentary lifestyle limit performance activity daily live , increase risk fall , may contribute heighten risk recurrent stroke cardiovascular disease ( Ivey et al . 2005 ) . There good evidence effectiveness regular physical activity ( PA ) primary secondary prevention several chronic disease e.g . stroke , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , colon cancer , breast cancer , hypertension , obesity osteoporosis ( Warburton et al . 2006 ) . Walking may one accessible form exercise stroke population . STARFISH mobile phone application design encourage user become physically active . Phase 1 project involve development current STARFISH ensure fit purpose people follow stroke . This do collaboration stroke survivor family necessary . The study investigate use STARFISH 6 week increase physical activity programme potential improve health well people follow stroke , include residual , physical , sensory visual impairment . Description STARFISH The current version STARFISH smartphone-based programme design behavioural change intervention encourage user become physically active . The sensor within standard smartphone record number step take per day individual . Each person represent fish within fish tank participant see mobile phone display . When participant active fish blow bubble swim faster , participant reach target number step per day , fish 's fin tail grow . Aims Objectives The overall aim adapt STARFISH use stroke survivor undertake feasibility study evaluate acceptability potential effectiveness STARFISH group . The objective : 1 . To use participatory co-design approach develop STARFISH software interface ensure STARFISH fit purpose use people stroke . 2 . To explore likely effectiveness STARFISH increasing level PA people post stroke . 3 . To explore likely acceptability STARFISH people post stroke . 4 . To provide sufficient data effect size STARFISH outcomes related amount physical activity undertaken , quality life , general well-being fatigue , walk speed , metabolic health biomarkers ( BMI , blood pressure , lipid profile , rest heart rate ) undertake power calculation establish sample size require fully power , randomise control study . Design &amp; Methods Design Following MRC guidance , propose mobile phone application development pilot evaluation comprise 2-phase ( sequential ) mixed-methods programme research . Phase 1 involve development current STARFISH mobile phone application . This involve participatory co-design application ensure suitability stroke survivor . Phase 2 involve piloting revise STARFISH application participant assess feasibility recruit target population , potential support participant become physically active , improve health behaviour deliver physical mental health benefit . The Phase 2 finding inform decision whether proceed large scale evaluation . Methods Up 6 stroke survivor attend Western Infirmary physiotherapy outpatient clinic recruit phase 1 study . Another 24 patient mild moderate stroke-related walking dysfunction single stroke recruit Chest Heart &amp; Stroke affiliate group . Potential patient give verbal write information study research team member . Patients willing take part study advise telephone researcher via contact detail Participant Information Sheet . Thereafter , participant willing participate study suitable date/time assessment arrange telephone , confirm letter . Phase 1 . An initial co-design session six people stroke undertaken elicit view current STARFISH application adapt meet need . For example , fish may require large allow stroke survivor see physical impairment upper limb voice activate command may beneficial . The software require modelling work sense different gait pattern people stroke thus ensure accurate counting step . Thereafter , STARFISH application refine prototype user trial ( 3 week ) undertake . Another co-design session organise evaluate change final revision application . Phase 2 . Participants initial visit Clinical Research Facility ( CRF ) study explain give mobile phone ask carry phone seven day establish normal level PA . They return CRF end seven day period baseline measure ( see ) agree activity target set . They randomise either intervention ( n=12 ) control group ( n=12 ) . The intervention group follow STARFISH programme six week . After three week group invite return CRF informally discuss progress PA target review amended necessary . During intervention period participant give contact number research assistant call experience problem . Control participants carry phone six week , allow recording level physical activity . Control participant access daily step access STARFISH app . All participant return CRF six week final measure take . All participant give daily activity result form short report . A summative focus group undertaken establish view participant area technical feasibility include accessibility , ease use effectiveness system . Participants : Phase 1 . Up six people stroke , participate phase 2 study , involve development/co-design stage . Phase 2 . Twenty four adult mild moderate stroke-related walking dysfunction single stroke randomise intervention ( n=12 ) control group ( n=12 ) . The randomisation process carry use seal opaque envelope contain participant 's unique number . All participant provide standard smartphone . Control participants carry phone six week without STARFISFH . STARFISH undertaken group four member group represent fish within tank , fish distinguishable colour belong specific individual thus participant get feedback activity level member group , real time , via visual representation fish fish tank . Different goal set different individual group , along goal whole group . The study design around framework base Control Theory , technique know successful behavioural change , include : goal setting , action planning , self-monitoring , review goal provide feedback performance ; social support likely act influence . Data collection Data collect follow : Demographic : Age , sex , height , weight , BMI Disease specific : Resting heart rate , blood pressure , Blood analysis ; blood lipid , LFTs , CRP , HBA1c The Ten-Meter Walking Test ( 10 MWT ) assess walk speed ( m/sec ) 10m distance , measure research assistant . Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) self report questionnaire evaluates impact fatigue . It contain 9 statement score 1 7 scale . A total score le 36 suggests patient may suffer fatigue . A total score 36 suggest patient may need evaluation physician . Instrumental Activities Daily Living Scale contain 8 item assess complex activity ( term `` instrumental activity daily live '' ) necessary function community setting . The high score , great person 's ability . The research assistant examine scale . Stroke Specific Quality Life Scale ( SS-QOL ) self-report questionnaire consist 49 item 12 domain energy , family role , language , mobility , mood , personality , self-care , social role , think , upper extremity ( UE ) function , vision , work/productivity . The domain score separately , total score also provide . Higher score indicate good functioning . Psychological General Well-Being ( PGWB ) Index . A measure self-representations intrapersonal affective emotional state reflect sense subjective well-being distress consist 22 item measure component psychological well-being anxiety , positive well-being , self-control , depression , general health vitality . Scores range 0 110 high score suggest good well-being . The PGWB index self-administered . Descriptive statistic use summarise variable . Where appropriate , comparison patient control use Students t-test UMann-Whitney analysis parametric non-parametric distribution respectively .</detailed_description>
