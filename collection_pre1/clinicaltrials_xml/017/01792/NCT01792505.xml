	<brief_summary>Malignant glioma aggressive among common brain tumor . A diagnosis carry median survival approximately 24 month . The current standard treatment surgical resection follow radiation therapy chemotherapy substantially prolong survival even treatment option show exhibit small increase survival primarily benefit certain ( i.e. , young ) patient subpopulation . Cancer vaccines represent one novel therapy malignant glioma . The goal body recognize tumor cell foreign produce response fight recur tumor cell . A promising mean cause immune response body create immunity use dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell Vaccine With Imiquimod Patients With Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dendritic cell small group cell contain everyone 's white blood cell population . These cell responsible let immune system know something foreign body . Dendritic cell help body ward disease alert immune system . Imiquimod FDA-approved cream immune response modifier , use off-label study . Imiquimod cream ( 5 % , 250 mg ) self-applied topically patient 4 x 5-cm outlined area healthy skin overnight day 1-5 cycle . Application removal time record treatment diary . Dendritic cell inject intradermally imiquimod-treated site day 3 . Cycles repeat every 2 week total three injection . This study examine effectiveness use Imiquimod DC vaccine , previous study within oncology department study effectiveness DC vaccine . Imiquimod ( Aldara , 3M ) one good characterize imidazoquinolines one currently approve clinical use topical ointment . It demonstrate possess antiviral antitumor property , approve treatment genital wart . Vaccination study animal model indicate imidazoquinolines boost magnitude quality T cell response . It consider Toll-like receptor agonist control activation dendritic cell . In human , show topical imiquimod treatment may enhance immunogenicity melanoma vaccine . Additionally , injection immature DCs imiquimod-pretreated skin lead DC activation situ enhance migratory capacity drain lymph node cancer patient . In study , investigator test safety feasibility imiquimod vaccine brain cancer induce potent immune response previously observe . In prior Phase I Phase II study , patient receive chemotherapy follow DC demonstrate long progression free overall survival patient receive DC chemotherapy alone . The use DC vaccine consider investigational yet approve FDA , investigator obtain IND use vaccine . The purpose study determine whether standard therapy tumor resection surgery follow DC vaccine Imiquimod generate ( start ) immune response , provide long progression-free survival . Subjects clinically indicate resection surgery consent screen study vaccine trial ( IRB # 9225 ) , subject tumor tissue analyze order verify eligibility study . Study procedure include follow : laboratory blood draw , urinalysis screening , immunological testing , administration quality life questionnaire , neurological exam , MRI testing , leukapheresis dendritic cell , review adverse events/concomitant medication . Patients screen enrolled clinical trial due screen failure notify reason screen failure . Pre HIV counsel appropriate referral resource provide . If screen failure due positive HIV test , appropriate post HIV counseling provide appropriate referral make . The chart patient screen failure destroy . The patient ' chart enrol study keep locked cabinet research office . Patients assign unique identifying code know research team . Data capture various source document , , necessary , abstracted hospital medical record experience registered nurse . The electronic data viral test accessible research personnel .</detailed_description>
