	<brief_summary>The GI MRI Research group University Nottingham develop new , non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques image gastrointestinal tract . The investigator want characterise ; collaboration College Pharmacy University Michigan , fast volume gastric small bowel liquid time course 2 hour drink FDA recommend 240 mL water drink oral solid dosage form test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>240 mL Water Drink Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Solid oral delivery frequently use route administration pharmaceutical drug product . Along important physiological parameter , volume liquid small intestine ( SILV ) potential greatly influence rate extent drug dissolution absorption GI tract , `` oral bioperformance '' . Modeled small bowel absorption drug vary five-fold SILV decrease 500 50 ml . To obtain reasonable prediction oral bioperformance scientist must design meaningful vitro dissolution test mechanistic drug transport model capture range SILV human . However , little known liquid volume gut , mostly due invasiveness previous technique . A recent study draw great attention possibility liquid small intestine exist discrete liquid `` pocket '' hence would also desirable monitor time course volume individual water pocket small intestine . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ideal tool carry serial non-invasive image gastrointestinal function . MRI inherently suit image liquid material ability exploit image liquid undisturbed gastrointestinal tract . Gastric empty measurement long establish validate . Small bowel liquid volume measurement recently validate naso-duodenal infusion . Ultimately , finding study provide novel insight volume distribution ingest liquid gastrointestinal tract .</detailed_description>
