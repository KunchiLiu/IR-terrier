	<brief_summary>Low triiodothyronine ( T3 ) syndrome defines decrease T3 level critically ill . This decrease T3 level observe congenital heart surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass . Previous large study , Triiodothyronine Infants Children Undergoing Cardiopulmonary bypass ( TRICC ) study show T3 supplementation decrease time extubation infant less 5 month undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass . Intravenous regiment know effective maintain T3 level pediatric cardiac surgery . This drug preparation however commonly use many country due relatively high cost and/or simple lack availability . The use oral T3 treat postoperative low T3 level pediatric patient report far , although recent adult study show benefit use oral T3 cardiac surgery . The purpose study determine oral T3 supplementation could prevent decline serum T3 child less 2 year age undergoing congenital heart surgery use CPB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Research Ethics Board National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita approve study write , informed consent obtain parent legal guardian randomization . Randomization block permutation perform determine treatment group assignment . Randomization occur day surgery nurse investigator . A pharmacist involve study prepare study medication . Investigators participant blind assign group end study . Thyroid hormonal level analyze standard 3rd generation thyrotropic-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , serum free T4 ( FT4 ) , free T3 ( FT3 ) , total T3 ( TT3 ) Micro particle Enzyme Immunoassays ( Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , USA ) . The serum total T4 ( TT4 ) assay use Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay ( Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , USA ) . Hormone level measure induction anesthesia , study drug give ( T0 ) 1 , 6 , 18 , 36 72 hour removal aortic-cross-clamp . Baseline clinical data collect included age , gender , birth weight , type operation , Aristotle score . Diagnosis operative procedure classify high low risk Aristotle score cut ≥ 9 high risk . As modify factor , measure duration surgery , cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) time , cross-clamp time , ultrafiltration CPB degree hypothermia CPB , use amiodarone . Non-pulsatile perfusion technique use CPB . Steroid ( methyl prednisolone 35-50 mg/kg ) give CPB . We use povidone-iodine skin disinfection subject . Although study power detect clinical difference treatment group , clinical outcome parameter measure potential guide subsequent adequately power large treatment study . Serum lactate measure 1 hour , 4 hour day 1 post surgery . Hemodynamic monitoring include heart rate , heart rhythm , blood pressure record hourly first 6 hour every 6 hour 72 hour surgery . Overt symptoms hyperthyroidism ground immediate removal subject study . Time extubation length stay intensive care unit hospital record . Statistical analysis sample size : The primary efficacy analysis assess difference treatment ( high-dose , low-dose ) control group regard effect T3 supplementation measure TT3 FT3 serum level . We anticipate difference 2.0 pg/ml FT3 standard deviation 0.8 pg/ml group . For statistical power 80 % identify treatment effect level significance 0.05 ( 2-sided ) , target total sample size 45 subject , 15 treatment group . Demographic data , safety clinical outcome compare use X2 test . Continuous variable characteristic outcomes analyze use one way ANOVA data normal distribution Kruskal Wallis test normally distribute data . Repeated measure ANOVA use analyze thyroid hormone level clinical outcome variable measure repeatedly time . Paired Student 's t-test parametric Wilcoxon sign rank test non-parametric test use evaluate mean difference hormone level clinical outcome time treatment group . Statistical significance define p-values less 0.05 . Descriptive statistic report mean ± standard error mean .</detailed_description>
