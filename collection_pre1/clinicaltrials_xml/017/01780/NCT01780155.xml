	<brief_summary>Background : - Some premature baby develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) . BPD ROP long-term chronic disease lung eye , respectively . BPD associate receive mechanical ventilation treat respiratory distress syndrome , cause lung inflammation scar . ROP cause poor development blood vessel eye , may lead blindness . Because premature baby develop BPD ROP , researcher want study gene could associate disease . They look premature infant parent see genetic component BPD ROP . Objectives : - To study gene may associate BPD ROP . Eligibility : - Premature baby bear weight less equal 1,250 gram . - Parents premature baby . Design : - Parents answer question mother health pregnancy . - Delivery medical information collect baby hospitalization first month birth . - Parents provide saliva sample inside cheek . - A saliva sample also collect baby within 28 day birth . If baby need tracheal aspiration ( removal fluid throat ) , tracheal fluid sample also collect . - Parents followup interview child health 6 month , 12 month , yearly 6 year birth . - This genetic study . Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Understanding role susceptibility gene risk BPD ROP may lead immediate identification population require personalized medical care , assessment innovative prophylactic therapeutic intervention future . Our purpose establish hospital network prospective cohort triad compose premature newborn birth weight less equal 1250 g parent , examine role candidate susceptibility gene development BPD ROP . Our hypothesis presence single-nucleotide polymorphisms candidate gene associate differential susceptibility BPD ROP . As initial model , loss-of-function substitution position -617 NRF2 promoter region hypothesize associate great risk severe BPD prethreshold ROP premature infant birth weight less equal 1250 g .</detailed_description>
