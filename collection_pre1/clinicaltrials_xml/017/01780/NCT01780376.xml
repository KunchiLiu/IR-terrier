	<detailed_description>Whole-body vibration ( WBV ) , method exercise training , become increasingly popular physical therapy , rehabilitation , professional sport , increasingly use beauty wellness application due beneficial effect neuromusculoskeletal system . These benefit include improved strength , power , flexibility , jump height , balance . However , little known physiological mechanism underlie effect WBV muscular performance , although presence reflex muscle activity WBV show . Tonic vibration reflex commonly cite mechanism explain effect WBV muscular performance , although conclusive evidence TVR occur . Studies report direct vibration apply muscle tendon stimulate muscle spindle , thereby cause tonic vibration reflex occur . As highlighted study , muscle spindle discharge send spinal cord Group Ia afferent muscle tendon vibration . There , activate motoneurones cause muscle contract . However , report sensitivity muscle spindle decrease increase presynaptic inhibition occur Group Ia afferent fiber vibration . The bone myoregulation reflex ( BMR ) another neurologic mechanism use explain effect vibration muscular performance . BMR reflex mechanism osteocyte expose cyclic mechanical loading induce muscle activity . Osteocytes embed bone matrix interconnect numerous dendritic process , form wide , mechanosensitive cellular network . Osteocytes expose cyclic mechanical load send mechanical input signal central nervous system , influence neuronal regulation muscle activity . Investigators hypothesize latency WBV-IRMA different latency TVR . Primary aim study determine latency WBV-IRMA . Secondary aim investigate whether WBV-IRMA explain TVR . Twenty healthy young adult men plan include study . Participants stand upright knee lock WBV . PowerPlate Pro5 use WBV . WBV high amplitude 25,30,35,40,45 50 Hz apply . Surface electrodes place soleus muscle . To measure TVR latency , piezo-electric accelerometer place achilles tendon achilles tendon stimulate spring base mechanical reflex hammer .
