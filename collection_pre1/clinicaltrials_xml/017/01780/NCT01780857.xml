	<brief_summary>This study do learn less common `` type '' psoriasis , call palmoplantar pustulosis ( PPP ) . The majority current treatment use type psoriasis moderate effect PPP . Thus , investigator believe PPP may different disease entity altogether , require different therapy . As , investigator hope discover immune signature condition . An immune `` signature '' unique way combination gene , cell , protein immune system work person . Because psoriasis type psoriasis patient diagnose , PPP , condition abnormal immune system function , important understand overall function immune system condition ( , find immune `` signature '' ) . This study help identify immune system `` signature '' people PPP . The investigator laboratory technology allow read genetic `` signature '' person 's blood cell . Genes contain instruction make living thing . Genes contain cell ' DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) . Most DNA among human , small difference people DNA may explain people develop different disease . DNA gene contains help produce RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) , turn help make protein people 's cell . Differences type protein amount different protein people 's cell produce affect person 's immune system . To help investigator determine immune `` signature '' PPP , examine different gene , cell , protein active patient PPP versus patient condition . The investigator examine gene , cell , protein skin ( skin sample ) blood ( blood draw ) . The goal develop new treatment skin condition . To , investigator need compare skin blood patient particular type psoriasis sample healthy patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I . SPECIFIC AIM Specific Aim . To identify transcriptional signature skin blood patient palmoplantar pustulosis ( PPP ) . II . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Despite major advance elucidate molecular pathway chronic plaque psoriasis ( CPP ) , immunopathogenesis PPP , less common `` variant '' psoriasis , remain elusive . It characterize development inflammatory sterile pustule palm sol affected individual , exceptionally painful , interfere walk manual activity impinge significantly quality life . Current systemic biologic treatment use treat CPP moderate effect patient PPP , support suggestion PPP separate disease entity distinct immunopathogenic basis . Moreover , spontaneous paradoxical development PPP frequently observe patient treated anti-tumor necrosis factor-Î± therapy , agent typically use treatment CPP . Genetic analysis also distinguish patient PPP CPP . At investigator ' institution , microarray analysis blood transcriptional pattern permit crucial advance characterize immunopathogenesis immune-mediated condition systemic lupus erythematosis systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis . The investigator wish examine transcriptional profile skin blood patient PPP identify immunopathogenesis condition identify potential therapeutic target . The investigator validate finding cellular protein level use flow cytometry , immunohistochemistry measure serum level proteins blood Luminex ELISA .</detailed_description>
