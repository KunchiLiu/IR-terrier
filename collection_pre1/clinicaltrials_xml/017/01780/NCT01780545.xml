	<brief_summary>This randomize , open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluate whether suppression Hsp27 ( Heat shock protein 27 ) production use OGX-427 , second-generation antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO ) , combination docetaxel prolong survival time compare docetaxel alone participant locally advance metastatic urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) relapse refractory receive platinum-containing regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Docetaxel +/- OGX-427 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . Eligible patient stratify base time prior systemic chemotherapy ( &lt; 3 v ≥ 3 month ) Bellmunt prognostic factor criterion , include Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &gt; 0 , hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dL , presence liver metastasis ( 0 versus 1-3 risk factor ) . Within stratum , participant randomly assign equal probability either investigational arm ( Arm A : docetaxel + OGX-427 ) control arm ( Arm B : docetaxel alone ) . INVESTIGATIONAL ARM OGX-427 + DOCETAXEL ( Arm A ) : LOADING DOSE PERIOD : Participants randomize onto investigational arm ( Arm A ) receive OGX-427 begin load dose period prior initiation docetaxel treatment . The first dose OGX-427 loading dose period must administer within 5 work day registration randomization . During load dose period , participant receive three separate administration 600 mg OGX-427 intravenously ( IV ) ( day -9 -1 ) . There must least one `` non-infusion '' day administration OGX-427 ( i.e. , every day ) load dose period third load dose OGX-427 day 1 cycle 1 . There 7 day last loading dose day 1 cycle 1 . TREATMENT PERIOD : During treatment period , participant randomize arm receive : - OGX-427 600 mg IV weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 21-day cycle . OGX-427 must administer prior docetaxel day 1 cycle . - Docetaxel ( 75 mg/M2 ) IV day 1 21-day cycle . Docetaxel administer immediately follow completion OGX-427 infusion . OGX-427 MAINTENANCE : Following completion 10 cycle docetaxel , 600 mg OGX-427 continue administer IV weekly maintenance therapy participant disease progression ( i.e. , stable disease well ) . Participants without documented disease progression discontinue study treatment due toxicity relate OGX-427 also continue receive OGX-427 maintenance long complete disease assessment follow least 2 cycle chemotherapy . Maintenance OGX-427 continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONTROL ARM - DOCETAXEL ALONE ( Arm B ) : TREATMENT PERIOD : During treatment period , participant randomize arm receive : - Docetaxel ( 75 mg/M2 ) IV day 1 21-day cycle . The first dose docetaxel must administer within 5 work day registration randomization . Participants continue receive docetaxel day 1 21-day cycle disease progression , unacceptable toxicity relate docetaxel , voluntary patient withdrawal , maximum 10 docetaxel cycle . FOLLOW-UP FOR BOTH ARMS : Imaging study perform every 6 week ( i.e. , completion cycle 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10 ) disease progression sign symptom new worsen disease ; compute tomography scan ( CT ) chest/abdomen/pelvis prefer magnetic resonance imaging scan ( MRI ) acceptable , especially participant increase risk contrast-related nephropathy contraindication . For Arm A , scan perform every 2 cycle ( 6 week ) +/1 week 21-day cycle docetaxel administration every 6 week maintenance OGX-427 administration disease progression ; Arm B , scan perform every 6 week 21-day cycle docetaxel administration disease progression . All scan complete subsequent cycle schedule begin . Bone scan repeat , positive baseline , every 6 week first 4 cycle treatment ( i.e. , end cycle 2 4 ) every 12 week thereafter disease progression ( i.e. , end cycle 8 , end treatment , maintenance OGX-427 [ Arm A ] ) . All participant End Treatment ( EOT ) visit discontinue study treatment . All participant follow documented disease progression . Once disease progression document , participant enter survival follow-up period . All participant must follow survival primary endpoint . During survival follow-up period , data collect every three month regard cancer therapy , secondary malignancy , survival status . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Life Expectancy : Greater 3 month Hematopoietic : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mcL - Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL - Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Hepatic : - Bilirubin ≤ 1.1 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( ≤ 2.0 x ULN secondary Gilbert 's disease ) - Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN Renal : - Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Cardiac : - Symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction within 3 month randomization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically document metastatic locally inoperable advanced urothelial carcinoma ( bladder , urethra , ureter renal pelvis ) ( T4b , N2 , N3 , M1 disease . NOTE : Aberrant differentiation squamous , glandular ( adenocarcinoma ) , micropapillary eligible unless tumor consider pure histological variant accord pathology report . Participants small cell histology eligible . Participants must measurable disease define least one target lesion irradiate accurately measure least one dimension RECIST v1.1 criterion . Participants must receive prior systemic chemotherapy treatment metastatic urothelial carcinoma . NOTE : Up 2 prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen give metastatic disease set urothelial carcinoma allow . Specifically , subject must meet one follow criterion : 1 . Progression treatment regimen include platinum salt ( e.g. , carboplatin cisplatin ) OR 2 . Disease recurrence within one year neoadjuvant adjuvant platinumbased systemic chemotherapy , measure date last dose chemotherapy surgery day inform consent sign Participants must ≥18 year since dose adverse event data currently available use OGX427 participant &lt; 18 year age . Minimum 21 day elapse since prior major surgery , recovery adverse event . Minimum 14 day elapse since prior radiation therapy , recovery adverse event . The effect OGX427 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . History treatment docetaxel set . Participants treat prior paclitaxel eligible . Prior enrollment OncoGenex Phase 2 Study OGX42702 . Participants may receive investigational agent . Participants know brain spinal cord metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . NOTE : Brain imaging required unless patient symptom physical sign central nervous system ( CNS ) disease . History allergic reaction severe hypersensitivity reaction drug formulate polysorbate 80 antisense oligonucleotides . Peripheral neuropathy ≥Grade 2 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Cerebrovascular accident pulmonary embolus within 3 month randomization . Pregnant woman breast feed woman exclude study risk fetus due docetaxel chemotherapy OGX427 systemic treatment ( fertility toxicology study complete OGX427 ) . Active second malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer incidental prostate cancer find cystectomy ) : active secondary malignancy define current need cancer therapy high possibility ( &gt; 30 % ) recurrence study .</criteria>
