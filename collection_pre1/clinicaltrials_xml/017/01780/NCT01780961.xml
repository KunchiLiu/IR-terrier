	<detailed_description>Prospective database contribute substantially advancement clinical medicine surgery . Examples contribution databases include improve understanding treatment outcome rare pathology , long term outcome , incidence uncommon complication common disease , repercussion infrequently perform complex procedure . ( 1-3 ) Problems identified database review lead improvement patient care guide plan numerous prospective study . The value databases incrementally increase number patient enrol length time database maintain . Recently databases used create test nomogram , increasingly implement refine patient prognosis stratify patient clinical trial . ( 4 ) We anticipate prospective database become valuable look future . Increasingly , molecular marker identify think important patient outcome treatment response . When link pathologic tissue , clinical database use initial test newly identify marker determine warrant independent prospective review . An independent prospective analysis perform marker costly time consume . A prospective database comprehensive , accurate , ultimately less time consume retrospective review test set marker novel question arise . This study augment prospective database patient esophageal cancer undergo investigation /or surgery Washington University School Medicine . This database periodically updated patient record computerize medical record patient continue routine follow-up care . These data use address question regard treatment and/or disease-specific outcome . In addition , seek acquire , store analyze tissue blood sample patient . Samples process stored Tissue Procurement Facility Washington University School Medicine . We use material support ongoing effort identify serum marker application early diagnosis , prognosis treatment efficacy . Markers identify link clinical outcome data capture database . Using database , able link patient treatment outcomes analysis perform previously collect pathologic specimen research specimens correlate result patient ' treatment response outcome time efficient cost effective way . The incidence esophageal adenocarcinoma rise . This trend note last decade go hand hand decrease incidence esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . Overall number patient esophageal cancer diagnose annually United States steadily increase . Esophageal cancer afflict approximately 19,000 patient annually United States . Broadly speak , esophageal cancer diagnose early stage metastatic disease distant organs relatively advanced stage evidence metastatic disease distant organ . Unfortunately patient metastatic disease receive palliative therapy survival quite limited . Stage I - III esophageal cancer often treat either primary surgery combination preoperative postoperative chemoradiation therapy along surgical resection . For stage I esophageal cancer , surgical resection usually suffice patient upwards 70-80 % five year survival . For patient stage III esophageal cancer , patient usually undergo induction chemoradiation therapy follow surgical resection . Induction chemoradiation usually involve two cycle % Fluorouracil cisplatin 5040 Gy external beam radiation therapy . This aspect treatment well standardize ( 5 ) . For stage II esophageal cancer , surgery form backbone therapy , however , clear consensus among treat physician efficacy role chemoradiation therapy patient . In patient undergo chemoradiation therapy prior surgery esophageal cancer , note 15-30 % patient complete pathologic response therapy . Thus tumor detect resected specimen patient . Therefore , theoretically , patient undergo unnecessary resection . There currently way predict patient would pathologic response short resect esophagus thus expose patient significant morbidity mortality associate major operation . The significant impact next-generation sequencing cancer genomics ability re-sequence , analyze compare match tumor normal genome single patient . With significantly reduce cost sequence tremendously enhance throughput , within realm possibility sequence multiple patient sample give cancer type . Genomic analyse last year , significant contribution Genome Center Washington University St. Louis , ( 6-7 ) lead significant advance understand behavior certain tumor include leukemias glioblastoma . Specifically , acute leukemia , center show certain genotype tumor predict favorable unfavorable outcome patient analyze . These finding replicate least 3 independent study separate AML cohort . Our goal project would develop understanding genomic profile esophageal carcinoma change treatment . Furthermore availability tissue chemoradiation therapy , would able identify change genome malignancy induction therapy . Also resection specimens able identify patient significant response therapy ( include complete pathologic response ) others significant response therapy progressive disease despite therapy . This may help u identify genomic feature spectrum esophageal carcinoma predict response therapy chance longitudinally study disease clinical course patient . Specifically would achieve obtain tissue specimen malignancy prior therapy time initial diagnosis initial endoscopy patient . Subsequently patient would undergo routine therapy would base upon clinical stage disease . Eventually patient come back definitive resection , would able access pathologic profile ass response induction therapy also study genomic profile tumor tissue induction therapy . A prospective database would maintain Division Cardiothoracic Surgery would able link clinical outcome process tissue ( pathologic specimen , research specimen plasma ) enable high level correlation study perform . Proper use resource aid considerably ability advance field care future patient esophageal cancer . Our eventual aim analyse genome esophageal cancer would identify patient population complete pathologic response chemoradiation therapy carcinoma esophagus . We able identify genomic difference , , tumor tumors partial response/no response/progressive disease induction chemoradiation therapy . If analysis sufficiently predictive efficiently dichotomize patient category base upon genomic profile , lead groundwork clinical trial patient certain specific genomic profile would treat chemoradiation therapy carcinoma esophagus , thus preclude unnecessary surgery significant attendant morbidity mortality . As already know , 15-30 % patient undergoing induction chemoradiation therapy clinically fall category . The well know morbidity esophagectomy include significant pulmonary problem , anastomotic leak , cardiovascular problem , chyle leak , venous thromboses , amongst major problem . The rate morbidity esophagectomy vary 20-40 % . Also 3-14 % risk mortality esophagectomy . ( 8-9 ) Therefore , tool effectively predict patient require esophagectomy treatment carcinoma esophagus would extremely useful clinically .</detailed_description>
