	<detailed_description>Background The weight malaria fall heavily young child pregnant woman study safety antimalarial pregnancy lactation . The recommended medication use radical treatment P.vivax primaquine . The 2010 WHO malaria guideline recommend use patient P.vivax infection area low transmission , absence contraindication . Primaquine contraindicate pregnancy . The postpartum period present key opportunity definitively treat woman suffer multiple malaria relapse pregnancy . The 2010 WHO malaria treatment guideline allow primaquine use lactation study date quantify primaquine excretion breast milk dose breastfed infant would expose unknown . The investigator propose study pharmacokinetics primaquine maternal infant plasma breast milk 14 day radical treatment P.vivax . Rationale The global burden malaria great , approximately 1-2 million death year many time number productive day lose illness . Plasmodium vivax prevalent malarial specie , result 132-391 million clinical infection year 80-90 % malaria Asia , Middle East , Western Pacific . Despite prevalence , P.vivax focus research recently , effect optimal treatment still fully understood . Though infrequently fatal infection , P.vivax cause high level morbidity due chronic nature infection . Because dormant liver stage ( hypnozoites ) , illness continue recur year , even effective treatment eliminate parasite blood . In setting hope malarial eradication , mean infected person continue host even vector-borne transmission temporarily interrupt , could potentially start new cycle transmission relapse . Each relapse cause significant amount morbidity small mortality risk infect . These burden magnify pregnancy woman experience relative immune suppression experience relapse every 4-8 week . P.vivax malaria pregnancy associate low birth weight anaemia ; thrombocytopaenia ; increase risk fetal loss , premature delivery , neonatal infant mortality ; , area , risk congenital malaria ( severe , sepsis-like illness ) . In Southeast Asia , investigator propose conduct study , majority case congenital malaria vivax infection . These woman may respite postpartum period , relapse spaced apart , frequently relapse subsequent pregnancy . New pregnancy end lactation common many malaria endemic area , include setting , make definitive treatment vivax infection woman challenge absence data safety primaquine breastfeed infant . Though anti-malarial pharmacopeia expand past decade , primaquine remain definitive treatment hypnozoite form Plasmodium vivax ovale . First synthesized 1946 , 14 day treatment eradicate parasite liver . However , medication associate risk methemoglobinemia , acute intravascular haemolysis glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficient host ( common malaria-endemic area ) . The elevation methemoglobin generally modest asymptomatic , occasionally significant methemoglobinemia cause cyanosis shortness breath require discontinuation medication . Primaquine consider safe pregnancy possible risk haemolysis methaemoglobin fetus . The recent WHO malaria guideline ( 2010 ) conflict information use lactation . They cite breastfeed contraindication primaquine administration P. falciparum malaria , permit use primaquine P. vivax lactation breast feed infant G6PD deficient . No study ever do lactate woman determine safety primaquine breastfeed optimal time administration , however , relaxation guideline infancy suggest potential safe use lactation . Some author note primaquine 's daily dosing might allow safe breastfeed mother pump milk time peak milk concentration expect discard milk . Some inference expect behavior primaquine lactation drawn know pharmacologic property . Primaquine pharmacokinetics well characterize healthy subject malaria patient single multiple oral dosing . Peak concentration reach within 2-3 hour dose plasma elimination half-life ~7 hour . It extensively distribute tissue largely metabolize inert carboxyprimaquine , major plasma metabolite , undergoes biotransformation unknown metabolites probably toxic parent compound . The identification metabolite human difficult pursue expect aminophenol metabolites unstable . Until recently , technique separate positive negative enantiomer primaquine carboxyprimaquine possible , obscure toxic therapeutic mechanism drug . Primaquine limit oral bioavailability adult plasma concentration generally low , make dangerously high concentration maternal milk unlikely theoretical standpoint . However , recent data suggest previously unrecognized sex difference exist pharmacokinetics medication men woman , woman accumulate high drug concentration men . Since side effect primaquine appear dose-related , find could significant . The time maximum concentration 2-3 hr ( long woman men ) investigator would expect see short lag reach peak breast milk concentration . Primaquine low molecular weight ( 259 ) slightly basic pH make likely transfer breast milk . Literature medication pharmacokinetics breast milk sparse begin capture interest researcher human right activist note woman often systematically exclude medical research virtue pregnant lactating status . As result , two state pharmacokinetic property drug remain poorly understood , much clinical therapeutic approach base consensus conjecture . No pharmacokinetic study do measure primaquine excretion breast milk . A study do antimalarial lactation show low level drug breast milk treatment . The frequent venous sample necessary pharmacokinetic research ideal participant , especially pediatric population . Recent effort make evaluate usefulness capillary saliva sample alternative sample measure .</detailed_description>
