	<detailed_description>Purpose : To determine whether use transurethral lidocaine prior transurethral catheterization sterile urine collection decrease procedural pain child 0-3 year old . Primary Aim 1 . To measure difference pain via Faces , Legs , Activity , Cry Consolability ( FLACC ) Pain Scale score time transurethral bladder catheterization urine collection child receive intraurethral 2 % lidocaine jelly prior catheterization . Secondary Aims 1 . To assess gender difference pain control transurethral bladder catheterization without pain control use intraurethral 2 % lidocaine jelly . 2 . To assess patient discomfort administration intraurethral 2 % lidocaine jelly . To assess parental impression discomfort intervention control group . 3 . To assess pain associate administration intraurethral 2 % lidocaine jelly . 4 . To measure difference pain via Modified Behavioral Pain Scale ( MBPS ) score time TUBC urine collection child receive intraurethral 2 % lidocaine jelly prior catheterization . Rationale : Urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) lead cause serious bacterial infection young infant child . Diagnosis UTI patient age group generally require obtain urine sample via transurethral bladder catheterization ( TUBC ) . TUBC painful , yet standard practice include analgesia infant child need procedure . Lidocaine commonly use topical anesthetic . Lidocaine jelly administer urethra prior catheterization , typically via preloaded syringe ( eg , Uro-Jet ) FDA approve indication . Lidocaine jelly antimicrobial characteristic sterile preparation , alter urine culture result . This study randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness local 2 % lidocaine analgesia instill urethra reduce pain distress child le 3 year require TUBC . Reducing pain distress associate TUBC important treatment goal , yet limit research child effect intraurethral analgesia TUBC . There grow evidence child receive inadequate pain control invasive procedure may suffer long-term effect . This Randomized Clinical Trial ( RCT ) could provide evidence drive change practice infant child require bladder catheterization , reduce pain distress child undergoing procedure . Study Design : This study enroll 68 child approximately 1 year . Inclusion criterion include age 0-3 year , English Spanish speaking guardian present provide consent , medical indication TUBC patient 's emergency department ( ED ) visit . Exclusion criterion include severe developmental delay impaired mentation ; neural tube defect , paraplegia , condition alter urethral sensation ; know urethral stricture , anatomic abnormality reconstruction ; history sexual abuse ; patient weight le 2.3 kg ; allergy previous adverse reaction lidocaine ; previous enrollment study ; prior successful attempt TUBC previous 7 day Subjects randomize receive either usual care TUBC 2 % lidocaine jelly administer intraurethrally approximately 5 minute prior TUBC . Group assignment block randomize stratify gender . In lidocaine group , 2 % lidocaine would administer intraurethrally via blunt tip Uro-JetÂ® 5 minute TUBC . Lidocaine would administer usual care group . Both lidocaine administration ( applicable ) TUBC videotape . Research team member gather information parental impression discomfort patient medical history well adverse event . A trained , blind observer review videotape procedure assign pain score use Faces , Legs , Activity , Cry Consolability ( FLACC ) scale . The FLACC scale validate pain scale utilized pre-verbal child , assess pain 5 separate behavior procedure . For TUBC , pain score record baseline , catheterization , one minute . After assign FLACC score , research team member review video assign MBPS score . MBPS pain score record baseline , catheterization , one minute . Following score TUBC procedure , patient intervention study arm also FLACC pain score assign one minute , , one minute administration lidocaine .</detailed_description>
