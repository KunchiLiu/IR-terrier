	<brief_summary>Patients coronary artery disease often prescribe drug call statin research show , lower cholesterol , reduce risk heart attack complication long-term . Experimental study suggest statin may also rapid anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant anti arrhythmic action ; however , whether effect benefit patient remain proven . The purpose STARR trial ( Statin Therapy Atrial Refractoriness Reperfusion injury ) evaluate whether short course commonly use statin ( atorvastatin , 80 mg day ) decrease inflammation stabilises electrical property upper chamber heart post operative period patient undergoing cardiac surgery heart-lung machine either valve replacement and/or coronary artery bypass grafting . It also examine whether treatment protect heart sustain tissue damage blood supply restore period ischaemia course surgery.In addition also explore impact intervention biology vessel use bypass surgery fat tissue vicinity heart &amp; blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evidence pre- perioperative statin treatment may reduce occurrence post-operative atrial fibrillation improve clinical outcome patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) major vascular surgery largely generate observational study . In recent meta-analysis 6 randomize trial ( 2 postoperative atrial fibrillation ( AF ) predefined outcome ) evaluate use perioperative statin treatment patient undergoing cardiac surgery ( n=651 patient total - study size 40 200 patient ) , statin use find reduce patient ' relative risk develop postoperative AF 43 % ( RR 0.57 , 95 % CI 0.45,0.72 ) absolute risk 14 % ( 95 % CI 8 % ,20 % ) . Although finding would consistent rapid , possibly , lipid-independent antiarrhythmic effect statin , important limitation ( e.g. , single-centre , small size , lack continuous ECG monitoring , mostly `` ancillary '' finding '' ) less bearing current clinical practice , mostly include statin-naïve patient . For reason , recent guideline management AF give strong recommendation use statins prevention postoperative AF . Thus , whether intensive statin treatment perioperative period confer cardio protection reduction atrial oxidative stress &amp; improvement atrial electrical remodelling remain demonstrated.As endothelial function strong determinant clinical outcome , improvement vascular redox state &amp; increase nitric oxide bioavailability arterial &amp; venous graft patient undergoing cardiac surgery may improve post operative outcomes.However still unclear whether high dos atorvastatin could confer additional beneficial effect human vessel . Adipose tissue ( AT ) release vasoactive molecule &amp; adipokines affect myocardial vascular biology . Recent evidence suggest statin may favourably alter AT biosynthetic activity increase AT release adiponectin ( An adipokine show anti-inflammatory anti-atherogenic effect ) turn improve vascular &amp; myocardial redox state . However limited data effect statin human adipose tissue biology finding date base cell line and/or relevant mouse model .</detailed_description>
