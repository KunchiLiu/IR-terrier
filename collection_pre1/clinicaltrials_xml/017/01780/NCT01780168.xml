	<brief_summary>Background : - Inborn error metabolism ( IEM ) affect body immune system function . People IEM also special dietary restriction may affect function immune system . Researchers want good understand IEM may affect immune system function . Objectives : - To study IEM may affect immune system function . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age IEM . - Healthy volunteer least 2 year age . Design : - Participants come NIH Clinical Center least 1 evaluation . Depending level participation , participant may return additional visit . All participant ( parent ) must keep detailed food diary 3 day initial visit . - At study visit , participant provide blood sample . Females childbearing age provide urine sample . - Participants offer hepatitis A vaccination already give . If visit occur flu season ( roughly September March ) , offer seasonal/H1N1 influenza vaccine . - Children 2 8 year age may require booster shot depend history vaccination . - At follow-up visit ( ) , participant provide additional blood sample . - Participants may return yearly flu vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The biochemical perturbation child inborn error metabolism ( IEM ) may affect immune response . As result , increase risk infection also hamper ability develop protective immunity vaccination . Characterizing perturbation immunity ability provide protective immunity IEM critical . Immune deficiencies well characterize IEM . Viral infection play significant role precipitate life-threatening acute metabolic decompensations various IEM . Seasonal variation respiratory gastrointestinal virus recent reduction herd immunity vaccine preventable disease place vulnerable population significant risk . The standard care patient routine childhood vaccination . However , underlie IEM enzymopathies may affect efficacy vaccination immune responses general . In protocol , clinically evaluate immunologic status patient IEM . Routine inpatient outpatient admission last 2-3 day may involve blood drawing , radiological procedure , nutrition assessment biometrics . Immune challenge may perform use vaccination seasonal influenza , Hepatitis A , pneumococcus ( PPV23 ) . Follow-up appointment schedule end study period . The overall study objective describe immune status patient population . The population consist patient previously evaluate NIH , physician referral , family direct study clinicaltrials.gov well patient advocacy group . All patient evaluate NIH Clinical Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients gender ethnicity age 2 year older eligible enroll protocol . Patients diagnose base determination several parameter may include : plasma ammonia , acylcarnitine profile , amino acid and/or organic acid pattern . Some DNA mutation enzyme analysis know pending . Participants need medically and/or nutritionally manage local metabolic provider . We obtain write consent patient review medical record home physician confirm eligibility . Healthy volunteer gender ethnicity 2 year old also eligible enroll vaccination arm protocol . These individual vaccinate blood collect outpatient set visit 1 2 . Influenza vaccination normally offer seasonally public . Hepatitis A vaccination currently part pediatric vaccination schedule . Volunteers compensate participation study . Healthy volunteer may local community , family member patient IEM . Patient healthy volunteer exclusion criterion include : le 2 year age , inability travel NIH medical condition , recent vaccination , severe reaction egg , latex , severe reaction previous immunization . The Principal Investigator may decline enroll patient reason base clinical judgment . Other criterion may lead exclusion include , example , reside hospital , patient treat intercurrent infection antibiotic evidence acute infection . Furthermore IEM patient , patient regular/local metabolic , genetic endocrine physician and/or family physician , pediatrician , internist also exclude . For IEM patient , Dr. McGuire contact potential patient local metabolic physician discus patient past medical history , detail last visit , current metabolic status determine whether patient appropriate candidate protocol . Closer schedule visit , Dr. McGuire confirm detail patient formula recipe medication . Lastly , family contact Dr. McGuire member study staff one week prior pending inpatient admission confirm patient metabolically stable ready visit NIH state relative health , adequate supply special formula , medication supplement .</criteria>
