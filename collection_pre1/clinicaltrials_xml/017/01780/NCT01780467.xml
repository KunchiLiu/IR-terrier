	<brief_summary>Use lay language . Many decision involve possibility gain lose relative status quo . The loss aversion behaviour cognitive concept explain people sensitive possibility lose object money possibility gain object amount money . We hypothesise dopamine could involve loss aversion behaviour . To highlight , choose model dopaminergic depletion : Parkinson 's disease The primary purpose protocol study role dopamine loss aversion phenomenon compare brain activity parkinsonian patient without treatment L Dopa , expose mixed ( gain/loss ) gamble use money . The second purpose highlight role dopamine depletion compare patient without treatment v healthy pair control . 2 group : - 20 parkinsonian patient ( test two time : without treatment L dopa ) - 20 healthy pair control Description protocol patient : J0 : Inclusion visit ( duration : 4h ) : - motor assessment ( UPDRS ) - neuropsychological psychiatric assessment ( MMS , MATTIS , BREF , Stroop , Ardouin scale , UPPS , MADRS , Hamilton , LARS ) . J0+1 day J0 +2 day : 2 visit MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) acquisition ( without treatment ) : Each acquisition compose orientation sequence+ anatomic sequence + functional sequence . For healthy subject , one visit 2 hour include MMS , MADRS MRI acquisition .</brief_summary>
