	<brief_summary>Innovative strategy reduce adult smoke prevalence include use genetic information motivate cessation , ultimately , tailor cessation pharmacotherapy . Success intervention depends , part , smoker ' interest participation genetic testing relate cessation understand use result ( i.e. , genetic literacy ) . The recent availability genetic risk test nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene ( CHRNA3 ) variant ( rs105173 ) associate nicotine dependence make highly feasible investigate smoker ' interest use genetic information nicotine dependence . Therefore , primary purpose study determine impact intervention provide smoker educational session genetic contribution smoke nicotine dependence plus genotype result rs1051730 smoke cessation outcome compare receive educational session . Secondary purpose determine : ( ) impact genetic education know personal genotype result genetic literacy outcome ( b ) feasibility recruitment retention method study address genotyping nicotine dependence . Primary outcome cessation-related behavior cognition indicate abstinence . Secondary outcome cognition emotion indicate genetic literacy . Knowledge gain study potential clinical translation genotyping becomes part smoke cessation , health-care provider understand address factor influence smoker ' adaptation genetically-informed cessation treatment . The study use longitudinal , repeated measure design ( experimental , control ; N=90 ; 45/group ) . All participant receive 90-minute educational session genetic contribution smoke nicotine dependence donate buccal swab sample genotyping . The investigator randomize participant two group : receive genotyping result genetic counseling session ( experimental ) ( control ) . Follow-up data collect group baseline week 2 , 6 , 10 experimental group receive genotyping result , brief follow-up study termination occur week 12 . Control group participant offer genotyping result end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim study : Aim 1 . Determine impact know personal genotyping result nicotine dependence risk smoke cessation ( primary ) outcomes week 2 , 6 , 10 . The working hypothesis cessation-related behavior : 1 . When compare control group , experimental group great : ( 1 ) smoking abstinence ; ( 2 ) use formal smoking cessation program ; ( 3 ) contact health-care provider cessation ; ( 4 ) use pharmacotherapy , ( 5 ) use self-management strategy cessation . 2 . There difference number quit attempt experimental control group . The working hypothesis cessation-related cognition : 1 . When compare control group , experimental group higher self-efficacy smoke cessation . 2 . When compare control group , experimental group higher abstainer lower smoker self-schemas . The secondary aim : Aim 2 . Determine impact know personal genotyping result nicotine dependence risk secondary genetic literacy ( secondary ) outcomes week 2 , 6 , 10 . The working hypothesis genetic literacy-related cognition emotion : 1 . When compare control group , experimental group great : ( 1 ) knowledge genetic contribution smoking , ( 2 ) mental representation indicate endorsement genetic risk nicotine dependence , ( 3 ) accurate perception genetic risk nicotine dependence , ( 4 ) self-efficacy use genotyping result . 2 . There difference psychological distress experimental control group . Aim 3 . Explore smoker ' perception experience contextualize participation genetic education genotyping nicotine dependence risk . We conduct focus group intervention control group participant week 2 6 intervention group participant receive genotyping result . Aim 4 . Determine feasibility intervention informs people personal genotype result nicotine dependence risk large clinical trial , include evaluation enrollment ( recruitment efficiency , attrition , problem solution ) , intervention fidelity ( delivery , receipt , enactment ) , data collection , subject acceptability intervention , estimation effect size sample size determination future , large clinical trial .</detailed_description>
