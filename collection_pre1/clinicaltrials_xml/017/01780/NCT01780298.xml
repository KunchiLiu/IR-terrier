	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common inflammatory disease airway affect approximately 10 % individual age 40 year smoke history . The disease characterize increase number airway white blood cell ( neutrophil , lymphocytes monocyte ) . Stimulation white blood cell result release different agent inflammation . Some agent give indication presence severity disease measure . This case control study conduct The Heart Lung Centre , London , UK . The study aim determine biomarkers differentiation subject COPD ( GOLD Stage 1-2 current smoker ≥ 10 pack year smoke history ) three match control group : one non-smoking subject ( never smoke ) , one ex-smokers one current smoker . COPD subject match non-COPD subject gender , age ethnicity . The study include range physiological measurement include lung function , computerize tomography scan ( CT scan ) , cardio pulmonary exercise test computerize multichannel lung sound analysis ( Stethographics ) . In addition , lung inflammation assess cellular molecular biomarkers use e.g . transcriptomics proteomics technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At screen visit , subject consent obtain prior conduct study related procedure . Informed consent may obtain registration/review visit Centre conduct thus prior visit 1 . The screen visit involve obtain demographic data medical history information well perform safety assessment vital sign measurement , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , clinical laboratory test . An induced sputum sample obtain ensure subject produce adequate sputum sample . Smokers receive information smoke cessation screen visit follow-up telephone call . Subjects come back center four occasion meet inclusion/exclusion criterion screen : - visit 2 : 4 21 day screen , - visit 3 : 3-14 day post visit 2 , - visit 4 : 3-14 day post visit 3 . A follow-up telephone call conduct 3-10 day post visit 4 .</detailed_description>
