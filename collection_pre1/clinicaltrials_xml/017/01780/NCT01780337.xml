	<detailed_description>Despite widespread advance treatment coronary artery disease grow use automate external defibrillator implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) treat ventricular arrhythmia , sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) due ventricular arrhythmia remain major public health problem . National estimate SCD out-of- hospital cardiac arrest range 400,000 450,000 event annually . Although cardiac mortality rate decline time , proportion cardiac death sudden increase time major advance device therapy prevention treatment SCD take place . This unfavorable trend consequence inability accurately identify die suddenly lethal ventricular arrhythmia disseminate effective preventive strategy population risk . Observational evidence indicate depression associate risk SCD , patient coronary artery disease well individual without heart disease . In patient ICDs , depressive symptom associate increase risk shock ventricular arrhythmia , suggest ventricular arrhythmia common depressed individual . A leading candidate mechanism may account association depression ventricular arrhythmia involve cardiac autonomic dysfunction ; instance , multiple study show depressed individual abnormal heart rate variability . Recent evidence emerge potential importance oxytocin cardiovascular response stress depression . Oxytocin 9-amino acid peptide produce hypothalamus release central nervous system bloodstream . Oxytocin hormone neurotransmitter function , affect target include hypothalamus , amygdala , hippocampus , brainstem , heart , uterus , region spinal cord regulate autonomic nervous system . Polymorphisms oxytocin receptor associate improved cardiovascular response laboratory stress human . Exogenous administration intravenous oxytocin prairie vole model isolation show protect heart rate response social isolation improve heart rate variability . In addition , intranasal oxytocin administer human augments sympathetic parasympathetic modulation heart rate . Initial study intravenous oxytocin demonstrate direct effect cardiac arrhythmia animal model , even include termination ventricular fibrillation , suggestive quinidine-like action myocardial excitability . However , administration intravenous oxytocin woman delivery associate abnormality cardiac repolarization even induce ventricular arrhythmia . Therefore , although reason believe administration exogenous oxytocin may affect probability arrhythmia , direction impact unclear .</detailed_description>
