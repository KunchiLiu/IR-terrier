	<brief_summary>Background : - Asthma lung condition cause difficulty breathe decrease lung function . Some people asthma severe disease symptom . They may less responsive standard treatment steroid . Researchers want compare severe asthmatic mild moderate asthmatic people without asthma long period . This information may help identify new treatment people whose asthma well control standard medication . Objectives : - To compare severe asthmatic mild moderate asthmatic , healthy volunteer , study progression outcomes disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose asthma least 1 year . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - This study involve initial visit NIH Clinical Center participant . Selected participant may ask return repeat visit number year . The test result participant asthma compare healthy volunteer . - All participant screen physical exam medical history . - Participants may ( necessarily ) follow test visit : - Complete medical history physical exam - Blood , urine , sputum , nasal cell sample - Breath test heart lung function test - Six-minute walk test measure ability exercise - Imaging study chest x-ray , bone density scan , sinus scan - Allergy skin test - Vocal cord exam - Overnight sleep study - Participants may remain study long willing participate develop health problem interfere study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Observational Study Severe Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma common disease significant public health problem , affect one every 10 individual , nearly 30 million people US alone . About 5-10 % asthmatic severe disease difficult control standard therapy . Severe asthmatic consider relatively resistant corticosteroid , mainstay therapy asthma . Furthermore , chronic corticosteroid therapy often result side effect adversely affect outcome . Thus , effective treatment option , safe , cost-effective easy administer , need severe asthmatic . As understanding asthma evolves , become clearer distinct phenotype differ regard demographic factor age , sex race , also , perhaps importantly , regard clinical , physiologic biologic characteristic . This heterogeneity may reflect distinct pathogenic mechanism result airflow obstruction clinical presentation asthma . In turn , good understanding different factor contribute disease severity pathogenesis necessary identify new , personalized treatment management approach severe asthmatic . Our goal gain well understand pathogenic mechanism differentiate severe asthma mild moderate asthma , include role above-mentioned factor disease control . In , hope discover novel pathway manipulate achieve primary aim develop new therapy severe asthmatic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All volunteer subject must least 18 year age must able provide inform , write consent participation study . Subjects recruit irrespective age , sex , race ethnicity . Eligibility study determine basis follow inclusion exclusion criterion . INCLUSION CRITERIA ASTHMATICS Subjects must 18 year age . Subjects must diagnosis asthma , define American Thoracic Society , least one year enter study . Subjects must history reversible airflow obstruction , define positive response inhale bronchodilator positive methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge ATS criterion . Severe , refractory asthma define 2000 ATS workshop consensus criterion . Refractory asthmatic meet one major criterion least two minor criterion outline Table 1.This definition applicable patient condition exclude , exacerbate factor optimally treat , poor adherence appear confound issue . Compliance medication adherence assess initial subsequent visit question subject medication use ( selfreport ) . If asthmatic subject fulfill criterion severe asthma , classify mild moderate asthmatic . Subjects must ability provide informed consent . INCLUSION CRITERIA NONASTHMATICS Subjects must least 18 year age without clinical diagnosis asthma . Subjects must evidence obstructive airway disease , define ATS criterion spirometry , negative methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge . Subjects must ability provide informed consent . Subjects match asthmatic gender age ( +/ 10 year ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Any concurrent condition ( medical , social behavioral ) , opinion research team , would preclude confound acquisition interpretation data delivery care .</criteria>
