	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety PKs RAL give HIV-1-exposed newborn infant risk acquire HIV-1 infection . The study also seek determine appropriate dose regimen RAL safely give infant first 6 week life . The study enroll 50 mother-infant pair . Mothers follow discharge labor delivery unit , infant follow 24 week birth . Infants assign non-randomly 1 2 cohort . Each cohort include two group infant : RAL-naïve group include infant born mother receive RAL delivery , RAL-exposed group include infant born mother receive least one dose RAL within 2 24 hour delivery . A minimum 12 infant enrol Cohort 1 . All infant Cohort 1 receive RAL oral granule suspension single dose within 48 hour birth , addition standard care ARV drug PMTCT , second dose RAL 7 10 day life . A minimum 20 infant enrol Cohort 2 . Within Cohort 2 , RAL start within 48 hour birth RAL-naïve infant 12 60 hour birth RAL-exposed infant . Both RAL-naïve RAL-exposed infant Cohort 2 receive RAL 6 week , addition standard care ARV PMTCT . Dosing determine base analysis data generate Cohort 1 study . Study visit infant Cohorts 1 2 occur study entry Week 24 include medical history , physical exam , blood draw , , select study visit , PK sampling . Note : As January 2017 , enrollment follow-up Cohort 1 ( RAL-exposed RAL-naïve group ) enrollment Cohort 2 ( RAL-naïve group ) complete .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Maternal Mother either know HIV1 infect prior labor identify HIV1 infect time labor immediate postpartum period . More information criterion find protocol . For Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ( RALnaive ) : Mother high risk transmit HIV infant evidence follow : Mother receive ARV therapy current pregnancy prior onset labor delivery ; HIV RNA level great 1000 copies/mL within 4 week ( 28 day ) prior delivery ; receipt ARV le 4 week ( 28 day ) delivery ; ARVs 4 week longer take ARV 7 day prior delivery ; mother documented drug resistant virus least one class ARV drug . Note : Mothers may receive prenatal and/or intrapartum ARVs . Note : For Cohort 2 RALexposed , requirement mother determine 'highrisk ' transmit HIV infant . Maternal write informed consent study participation Maternal Known maternalfetal blood group incompatibility evidence presence unexpected clinically significant maternal red cell antibody know capable cause hemolytic disease fetus/newborn Mother receive RAL part combination antiretroviral ( cART ) regimen delivery intend breastfeed infant For Cohort 1 ( 6 mother ) Cohort 2 RALnaïve : Mother received RAL prior delivery Infant For Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ( RALnaive ) : Fullterm infant expose HIV age 48 hour less . Infant may receive 48 hour standard care ARV prophylaxis enrollment . For Cohort 2 ( RALexposed ) : Fullterm infant expose HIV age 60 hour less . Infant may receive standard care ARV prophylaxis/treatment enrollment . Infant gestational age birth least 37 week No know severe congenital malformation medical condition compatible life would interfere study participation interpretation , judge examine clinician Birth weight least 2 kg Able take oral medication Parent legal guardian able willing provide sign informed consent For Cohort 2 RALexposed Group : Infants bear mother receive least one dose RAL within 2 24 hour delivery . Note : Based mother 's selfreport confirm medical record available . Note : For Cohort 1 RALexposed Group infant bear mother receive RAL part ARV regimen . Infant Infant bilirubin exceed American Academy Pediatrics guideline phototherapy , use infant 's gestational age risk factor describe protocol Clinical evidence renal disease , edema , ascites , encephalopathy For Cohort 2 RAL naïve , Cohort 1 ( RALnaive RALexposed ) : Receipt disallow medication ( phenytoin , phenobarbital , rifampin )</criteria>
