	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose brentuximab vedotin combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) administer every three week child relapse primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . II . To define describe toxicity brentuximab vedotin combination gemcitabine administer schedule . III . To determine complete response ( CR ) rate treatment four cycle gemcitabine brentuximab vedotin among patient relapse refractory HL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity brentuximab vedotin combination gemcitabine within confines Phase 1 study . II . To describe overall response rate ( ORR ) 4 cycle therapy among patient relapse refractory HL . III . To describe proportion patient HL able mobilize adequate yield cluster differentiation ( CD ) 34+ stem cell gemcitabine brentuximab vedotin . IV . To describe relationship disease response among patient HL change thymus activation-regulated chemokine ( TARC ) treatment , determine specific micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) profile correlate response treatment . V. To describe frequency Fc gamma receptor IIIa ( FcγRIIIa ) -158 valine ( V ) /phenylalanine ( F ) polymorphism among patient experience pulmonary toxicity protocol . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study brentuximab vedotin follow phase II study . ( Phase I complete amendment 4 ) Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients CR course may go protocol therapy stem cell transplant . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month .</detailed_description>
