	<detailed_description>Dance Dance Revolution ( DDR ) may offer innovative highly effective format deliver exercise program people MS . It fun , engage interactive video game require player move foot target match rhythm song . In addition , DDR , involve aerobic exercise cognitive training , ideal intervention improve cognitive functioning MS . The purpose pilot study examine use DDR novel highly specific exercise intervention improve mobility cognition among individual MS. We guide follow three specific aim hypothesis : Specific Aim 1 : Determine eight-week exercise program administer use DDR improves dynamic balance people MS relative wait-list control group . Hypothesis 1 : Dynamic balance measure Berg Balance Scale improve DDR intervention wait-list control group . Specific Aim 2 : Determine DDR intervention , combine fitness cognitive training , course eight-week intervention , positive effect domains process speed executive control , wait-list control group . Hypothesis 2 : The DDR group relative wait-list control group , show significant improvement cognitive functioning assess Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT ) , measure process speed , executive functioning . Specifically , hypothesize give severe deficit process speed executive control , participation DDR intervention , result significant improvement PASAT , widely use measure assess cognitive functioning patient MS . Specific Aim 3 : We also examine whether improvement cognitive process engender DDR PASAT support change underlie neural circuit , infer pattern event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) activation obtain 3 Tesla scanner . Hypothesis 3 : Improvements cognition index high accuracy score faster reaction time PASAT , accompany change recruitment underlie neural process infer functional magnetic resonance imaging . MS participant DDR group show increase recruitment attentional network , specifically prefrontal parietal cortex , cortical region responsible successful performance PASAT task .</detailed_description>
