	<brief_summary>The investigator enrol 3-12 month old infant diagnosis tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) new study early marker autism . The study look early sign autism population ( TSC ) autism common . The goal project use behavioral testing , MRI EEG technique identify child risk develop autism start 3 month age continue 36 month age . Throughout study , investigator recommend Early Intervention service child show early sign autism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Biomarkers Autism Infants With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This five-year multi-site study use MRI EEG technology identify developmental precursor Autism Spectrum Disorder patient Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) . The study enrol infant five TSC center throughout country , include Boston Children 's Hospital , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center , University Alabama Birmingham , University Texas Houston University California Los Angeles . The main goal study identify early sign autism child TSC look brain MRI/diffusion tensor imaging , EEG behavioral/neuropsychological method . Eligible infant age 3-12 month evaluate longitudinally regular visit interval 3 year age . Study Objectives 1 . To characterize developmental precursor ASD large number TSC infant use prospective multi-center design : Infants TSC evaluate longitudinally age 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 36 month . At age , child undergo standardized evaluation , use cognitive adaptive measure . At age 24 36 month , formal assessment autism perform . Clinical data include medication use , seizure history , EEG activity , genotypic variation , co-morbidities record determine specific clinical factor modify course development . 2 . To identify biomarkers advanced diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) help predict development ASD TSC infant : The investigator hypothesize decreased white matter integrity perform annually first 3 year life , include DTI sequence tractography . Radial , axial , mean diffusivity fractional anisometry calculate time point change time correlate development ASD determine relative risk . Individual measure time point compare ASD non-spectrum group assess individual impact measure time . 3 . To identify biomarkers quantitative EEG help predict development ASD TSC infant : The investigator hypothesize altered functional connectivity , measure qEEG coherence high frequency oscillation , correlate development ASD TSC . Quantitative EEG ( qEEG ) , EEG coherence/gamma frequency ( 30-50Hz ) , high frequency oscillation encompass ripple ( 80-250H ) fast ripple ( 250-500 Hz ) measure time point . Changes time correlate development ASD determine relative risk , comparison individual measure two group . EEG finding also correlate MR result obtain couple functional connectivity measure EEG structural connectivity measure DTI .</detailed_description>
