	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis disease characterize reduced bone mass increase skeletal fragility , predispose increased fracture risk . The presence low trauma fracture powerful predictor future fracture 50 % patient fragility fracture suffer subsequent fracture next 10 year ( Center Jacqueline R , 2007 ) . Osteoporotic fracture associate increased morbidity mortality also high financial cost . However , less 20 % patient present low trauma fracture receive appropriate post-fracture osteoporosis management ( Little Eccles , 2010 ) . The hypothesis lack information assessment consequences patient physician raise explain gap recommend care usual practice . The aim PREVOST program ass efficiency patient-centered osteoporosis prevention program , fragility fracture upper limb , improve post-fracture management osteoporosis ( ie BMD test / osteoporosis treatment ) woman 50 year old . This open randomize controlled trial aim compare BMD osteoporosis treatment prescription rate 6 month inclusion two group : `` intervention '' receive information fracture osteoporosis ( oral write ) , phone call reminder write information give family physician , `` control '' receive usual care without information .</brief_summary>
