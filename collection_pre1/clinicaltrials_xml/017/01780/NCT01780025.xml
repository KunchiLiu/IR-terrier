	<brief_title>Objective Measures Implantable Hearing Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new technique , call Direct Acoustic Cochlear Stimulation , recently introduce restore hearing patient severe hearing loss due immobility small ossicle middle ear , stapes . A piston-like prosthesis , place inner ear , connect implantable mechanical stimulator , name DACS . Unfortunately , active middle ear implant , correct function technique check surgery , lead possibly variable outcome hearing . In project , objective auditory evoke potential , like Auditory Steady-State Response ( ASSR ) , use measure efficacy method inner ear stimulation . This highly innovative , non-invasive research provide valuable insight new promise way inner ear stimulation may give unique possibility measure correct connection implantable hearing device inner ear .</detailed_description>
