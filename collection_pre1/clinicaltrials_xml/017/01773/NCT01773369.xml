	<brief_summary>Early childhood injury perinatal ( around birth ) stroke devastate child life problem life , typically close normal lifespan . One 'opportunity ' present brain injury early life compare later adulthood young brain much plastic ( malleable ) receptive intervention . This particularly true neural circuit still development . We test hypothesis early ( &lt; 2 yr old ) , intensive leg training improve walk train train &gt; 2 yr old . We determine change induce train motor sensory pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Motor Training After Perinatal Stroke Enhance Walking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children 8 mo 3 yr old unilateral perinatal stroke randomize either : 1 ) Immediate Training , 2 ) Delayed Training group . The Immediate Group train 3 mo shortly recruitment . The Delayed Group go measurement time recruitment 3 mo later ( train ) obtain 3 mo change score serve control measure Immediate Group . The Delayed Group also train 3 mo delay , control measure take . Comparison improvement make child start train &lt; 2 yr old &gt; 2 yr old answer question training &lt; 2 yr old good &gt; 2 yr old . Finally , determine long term effect training , compare outcome trained child another group child injuries intensive training ( i.e. , old training study ) , child turn 4 yr old . Clinical , kinematic electrophysiological measure take help u understand efficacy treatment , also neural mechanism might underlie improvement outcome . We measure outcomes multiple time change score interest . All child change age , critical compare change score without intervention .</detailed_description>
