	<brief_summary>The purpose study test use tool ( NOTSSdk ) ass provide feedback trainee surgeon ' non-technical skill . It focus two aspect : reliability rating trainee surgeon use NOTSSdk ; content quality feedback give trainee base observation use NOTSSdk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing NOTSSdk Clinical Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific research question : - How many situation ( =operations ) necessary ass use NOTSSdk , get reliable rating trainee surgeon ' NTS ? - What impact NOTSSdk feedback tool content feedback conversation regard NTS ? - How trainee perceive usefulness feedback session ? - How raters perceive usefulness rating feedback session ? Materials method We aim sample 15 trainee one hospital . Demographic data collect regarding : gender , age , postgraduate experience ( years/months ) , surgical experience ( years/months ) , specialist train level assessor trainee . Procedure The head surgical department inform project ask permission recruit trainees assessor . Participants inform project orally write prior commencement . Surgeon assessor trainee give NOTSSdk handbook familiarize system study . The assessor receive short guidance provide assessment give feedback use NOTSSdk immediately first operation . After first assessment feedback session , assessor offer short structure guidance fill assessment form provide structure feedback . It also allow assessor solve ambiguity , ask question get explanation category element NOTSSdk . Eligible operation : laparoscopic cholecystectomy , hernia repair , laparoscopic appendectomy , small bowel obstruction , hemicolectomy - depend trainee 's competence . Reliability study Each trainee assess one surgeon assessor use NOTSSdk operation . Each trainee assess two occasion . Assessors vary accord availability . This produce app . 30 assessment total . Feedback study Data collect connection data gathering reliability study , data provide assessor trainees occasion . After operation surgeon provide feedback trainee base his/her observation . This feedback session observe audio record primary investigator . After feedback session trainee surgeon individually survey explore perception feedback session usefulness . After last feedback session assessor survey perception NOTSSdk feasibility . Data analysis Reliability study Generalizability theory apply analyze many operation necessary observe reliable assessment . First different variance component ( trainee , assessor , case etc . ) estimate ( three facet , balance design trainee nest within assessor nest within operation ) . These used generate Generalizability coefficient estimate overall reliability use NOTSSdk depend number assessor operation observe . Feedback study We use qualitative content analysis emergent theme explore content feedback session special focus : - Frequency NTS topic discuss time - Frequency TS topic discuss time Descriptive statistic use present trainee ' perception usefulness feedback present assessor ' perception usefulness feasibility rating feedback .</detailed_description>
