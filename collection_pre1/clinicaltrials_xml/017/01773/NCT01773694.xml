	<detailed_description>Physicians commonly instruct patient keep wound dry 2 3 day follow surgery . The rationale may source water like shower , bathtub , swim pool may increase risk infection . There may also concern change dress early post-operative period increase risk bleed complication . However , patient 's routine quality life disrupt asked avoid bathing , exercise , swimming . These issue never formally study . This study test hypothesis whether early post-operative wetting influence infection rate , bleed complication , appearance surgical wound . Patients present Penn State Hershey dermatology clinic surgical removal cancerous non-cancerous skin lesion invite participate . There change standard surgical treatment . The dress study participant . After surgery , study subject consent participate randomize receive one two set post-operative instruction . One group direct keep initial post-operative dress intact dry 48 hour . The second group remove dress 6 hour wet wound 10 minute whatever manner choose ( shower , bath , pool , hot tub , etc. ) . After initial dress remove ( 48 hour 6 hour ) , group perform identical post-operative care , consist cleanse wound soap water follow application petrolatum ointment dry dressing . All participant follow-up 7 14 day surgery earlier experience problem . At time , site assess clinical evidence infection bleeding . If former present , bacterial culture obtain confirm wound infection patient treat antibiotic . Physicians perform assessment blind patient 's status ( early wetting group ) . All subject also complete questionnaire inquire wet wound surgery well two questionnaire ask quality-of-life function affect . Participants follow-up 6 month blind investigator ass cosmetic appearance scar use establish scar rating tool . The data study provide valuable evidence base guidance surgeon draft wound care instruction patient . If hypothesis prof correct , patient may spar inconvenience post-operative water avoidance , diminish disruption life cause skin surgery .</detailed_description>
