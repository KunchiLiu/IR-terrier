	<brief_summary>The appropriate initial oxygen concentration resuscitation extremely low birth weight infant establish use large well design , randomize , blind , prospective trial level oxygen utilized practitioner situation highly variable . This propose trial use target oxygen saturation level first 15 20 minute life compare low high initial oxygen level resuscitation infant , large enough evaluate short term outcome survival without oxygen 36 week survival without retinopathy prematurity , long term outcome survival without significant neurodevelopmental impairment 2 year age . Such information urgently require provide evidence basis initial oxygen concentration resuscitation preterm infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Room Air Versus 60 % Oxygen Resuscitation Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Premature Infants Resuscitated Oxygen Air ( PRESOX ) trial , prospective randomize clinical trial extremely premature infant assess use low high oxygen concentration initial resuscitation . The hypothesis infant resuscitate low oxygen concentration birth increase survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) initial hospitalization , increase survival without neurodevelopmental impairment . Previous study mostly term newborn infant demonstrate initial resuscitation room air compare 100 % oxygen result improved outcome overall decrease mortality . The analysis study demonstrate reduction mortality significant preterm infant include trial . A number small clinical trial demonstrate feasible treat preterm infant low versus high concentration oxygen carefully monitor oxygen saturation minute follow delivery . As review previous observation demonstrate reduction death use low oxygen concentration , imperative large study preterm infant conduct determine lower compare high oxygen concentration initial resuscitation lead improve short long term outcome include survival without neurodevelopmental disability . The PRESOX trial randomize infant 23 week gestation 28 week gestation require resuscitation birth receive either room air 60 % oxygen . Oxygen saturation monitor first minute life initial oxygen concentration titrate use unique purpose build device track oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) within choose target limit . The target choose allow infant oxygen saturation follow increase see normal preterm infant require resuscitation . Following resuscitation infant transfer Neonatal Intensive Care Unit management follow usual care unit . In subset infant , level antioxidants infant 's blood urine measure Dr M Vento . This portion study already fund combined Spanish Ministries Health Science . Antioxidants known increase exposure oxygen . The infant return neurodevelopmental follow examination age two year . This trial provide urgently need evidence establish optimal care fragile preterm infant .</detailed_description>
