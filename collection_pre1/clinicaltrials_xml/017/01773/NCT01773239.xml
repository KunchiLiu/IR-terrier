Approximately 3540 % subject recruit female , approximately 5060 % potential subject EuroAmerican , 1020 % AsianAmerican , 1520 % Latino , 1520 % AfricanAmerican . The subject sample reflect racial ethnic diversity Northern California prevalence schizophrenia across gender age period . The investigator study volunteer subject high risk psychosis clinically stable , ages 1235 . Approximately 3540 % subject recruit female , approximately 5060 % potential subject EuroAmerican , 1020 % AsianAmerican , 1520 % Latino , 1520 % AfricanAmerican . Our subject sample reflect racial ethnic diversity San Francisco Bay Area . The study volunteer healthy control match age gender subject high risk psychosis . The study subject medication change study researcher . If subject 's personal doctor change medication , change simply document study researcher . Investigators recruit subject clinical diagnosis schizophrenia , schizophreniform schizoaffective disorder first psychotic episode within last 5 year , good general physical health ; age 12 35 year ; Is fluent proficient English language ; neurological disorder . In addition , subject must achieve clinical stability , define outpatient status least 3 month prior study participation , plus stable dos psychiatric medication least one month prior study participation use follow operationalized definition : stable low moderate dose antipsychotic medication ( &lt; 1000 mg. chlorpromazine equivalent ) least 4 week prior study , plus stable dos psychotropic medication ( anticholinergic , benzodiazepine ) least 4 week prior entry . However , subject require medication participation . Minors must parental/legal guardian consent participate .

This study also recruit subject meet criterion Prodromal Syndrome define SIPS : Attenuated Positive Prodromal Syndrome : Ideas reference , odd beliefs magical thinking , paranoid ideation , odd thinking speech , odd behavior appearance prodromal level intensity rat level 35 Scale Prodromal Symptoms ( SOPS ) . Symptoms must occur average frequency least per week past month . Brief Intermittent Psychotic Syndrome : Positive symptom rat psychotic intensity score 6 SOPS disorganize dangerous , last 1 hour per day average frequency four day per week one month , begin past three month , currently present least several minute day frequency least per month . Genetic Risk Deterioration Syndrome : Schizotypal personality disorder OR first degree relative DSMIV psychotic disorder , PLUS significant decrease functioning define 30 % great drop GAF score last month compare 12 month ago . High Risk Syndromes : Individuals experience subthreshold psychotic symptom without restriction frequency onset , functional impairment , family history psychosis . Investigators recruit age gender match healthy comparison subject meet criterion Axis I diagnosis SCID . They meet prodromal criterion Prodromal Questionnaire administer screen . All subject must good general physical health ; Fluent proficient English language . Minors must parental/legal guardian consent participate . Although investigator request family member also participate clinical assessment , require proband eligible . Individuals diagnosis schizophrenia need within 5 year onset , might pass first part study . Also , must least 18 year age due developmental consideration social cognition software someone age 18 . The 16 healthy control also run part study age gender match individual diagnosis schizophrenia . Recent Onset Schizophrenia Subjects : Investigators exclude subject history psychoactive substance abuse past 6 month determine DSMIV criterion SCID interview . Prodromal Subjects : Psychotic disorder previously diagnose schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder psychotic syndrome define SIPS : Fully psychotic symptom occur least one hour per day minimum average frequency 4 day per week one month OR psychotic symptom seriously disorganize dangerous . Healthy Control Subjects : Criteria meet Axis I diagnosis SCID . Healthy control first second degree relative diagnosis schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder . Any previous psychiatric hospitalization exclude healthy control study . Any subject presenting significant danger self others require inpatient treatment refer treatment evaluate study eligibility acute care treatment longer necessary . Subjects also exclude neurological disorder , mental retardation ( IQ &lt; 70 previously document , intellectual testing , necessary ) , autism . Physical disability prohibits test ( deafness blindness ) . Subjects exclude currently meet DSMIV criterion alcohol/substance dependence meet criterion within last 6 month OR prodromal symptom present use withdrawal alcohol/substances OR subject unable attend assessment sober .
