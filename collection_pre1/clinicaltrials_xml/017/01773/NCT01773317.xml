	<brief_summary>A prospective randomized control trial use evaluate efficacy post-operative perturbation training . 80 patient regular participant activity involve cut , pivot , jumping , lateral movement prior injury range age 14-40 time injury eligible . All eligible subject must undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction single surgeon use quadruple hamstring autograft soft tissue allograft designate preoperative postoperative rehabilitation University Delaware Physical Therapy clinic . Using prospective randomize design , 40 subject receive University Delaware Physical Therapy post-operative treatment protocol block randomize sex 40 patient receive 10 session post-operative perturbation training addition standard agility return activity progression forty receive standard agility return activity progression . Post-operative perturbation training initiated athlete least 8 week post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction , full range motion achieve 80 % quadriceps strength symmetry , criterion currently use begin return activity progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For many year , laboratory examine functional capability movement strategy individual sustain anterior cruciate ligament injury knee . Using battery clinical test measure athlete , learn individual respond similarly injury . Some athlete , call potential copers , experience high level function injury . Rehabilitation involve specialized training call perturbation training allow majority potential copers successful return sport short-term . Non-copers , however , group anterior cruciate ligament-injured athlete poor knee stability daily activity . The capability individual return sport limit , anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction typically recommend . Over last five year , begin investigate effect perturbation train non-copers . Non-copers represent majority anterior cruciate ligament-injured athlete , great interest distinct functional limitation , also large variability within group . Abnormal movement pattern common follow anterior cruciate ligament injury , strategy differ potential copers non-copers . During activity basic walking , non-copers reduce motion injure knee increase work do hip ankle , perhaps effort avoid knee instability . Non-copers limit motion knee activate several muscle around knee simultaneously . So may effective stabilize knee short term , strategy may cause alter potentially harmful loading pattern within knee joint . The abnormal movement alter muscle firing pattern anterior cruciate ligament-injured athlete believe mechanism knee osteoarthritis . Though anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction restore knee stability , surgery fully address faulty movement individual . Pre-operative perturbation train effective improve function normalize knee motion non-copers . Perturbation train improve ability non-copers return sport , suggest patient factor may relate post-surgical outcome . Women know great risk anterior cruciate ligament injury men , recently poor outcomes woman follow surgery also find . In response pre-operative training , woman demonstrate improve function gait symmetry , recover much slowly surgery demonstrate abnormal pattern knee joint load . Persistent faulty pattern woman warrant study research help u find way u address abnormality . This goal work determine whether perturbation training improve knee function reduce faulty adaptation anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction . Specifically , aim project investigate whether addition post-operative perturbation training result low loading , good movement pattern well functional outcome standard care .</detailed_description>
