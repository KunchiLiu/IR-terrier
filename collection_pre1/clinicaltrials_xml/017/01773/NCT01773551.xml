	<brief_summary>The purpose research study investigate whether breast density measure safe , painless image method ( call Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging - DOSI ) detect decrease breast density subject receive tamoxifen compare patient receive drug . If decrease density reliably detect , may help determine subject benefit take tamoxifen chemoprevention drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Quantitative Tissue Optical Index Breast Density For Prediction Hormone Therapy Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study develop safe , painless image method measure change breast density cause hormonal chemotherapy treatment tamoxifen . For many patient breast cancer , chemoprevention drug ( tamoxifen ) reduce risk recurrence . However , tamoxifen also cause serious side effect blood clot increase risk uterine cancer . Patients would benefit individualized method determine whether chemoprevention work . Recent study show course tamoxifen effective reduce risk woman exhibit &gt; 10 % reduction breast density compare woman little density change . The study suggest breast density predictor effectiveness tamoxifen . We propose use imaging method use safe visible near-infrared light measure breast tissue call diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging . Diffuse optical spectroscopic image allow patient follow treatment cost-effective , bedside , handheld scan probe . In study , examine whether diffuse optical spectroscopic image sensitive density change induce tamoxifen preventative hormonal chemotherapy agent . MRI use standard comparison . We expect discover 12-18 month , woman tamoxifen treatment show significant reduction breast density compare woman take tamoxifen , change monitor use DOSI alone . If validate , method could use determine tamoxifen treatment work individual patient could guide doctor decision end and/or switch different treatment . In addition , validate index density obtain use inexpensive , risk-free bedside technology could apply challenge problem measure individual risk breast cancer broad population .</detailed_description>
