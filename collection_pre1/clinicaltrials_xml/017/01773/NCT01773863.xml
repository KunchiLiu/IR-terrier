	<detailed_description>Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) common infection lead hospitalization intensive care unit common cause death associate infection disease . Epidemiological study show respiratory tract infection associate increase risk development acute cardiovascular cerebrovascular event . This link support study indicate influenza vaccination associate reduce risk hospitalization pneumonia well heart disease , cerebrovascular disease risk death cause influenza season elderly . Data connect acute respiratory tract infection cardiovascular event stem almost exclusively cross-sectional retrospective study pathophysiological relationship pneumonia cardiovascular damage still elusive . The first aim study analyze prevalence major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event ( MACCE ) patient hospitalized CAP , follow two year hospitalization . During hospitalization myocardial damage strictly monitor measure cardiac troponins discharge . Cardiac troponins establish marker myocardial damage . Cardiac troponin elevation see set acute coronary syndrome also variety condition directly relate flow-limiting coronary stenosis occlusion coronary artery , pulmonary embolism , sepsis , heart failure stroke . In setting , well document elevate circulating level troponins associate poor prognosis , regardless underlying disease . Sparse information exist concern significance troponin elevation respiratory tract infection . Most study investigate role troponin elevation patient admit hospital acutely exacerbate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ; recent study investigate specifically CAP , show correlation troponin elevation oxygenation impairment ; however , underlie mechanism explore . Inflammation play major role pathogenesis coronary artery disease . The increased concentration proinflammatory cytokine together activation coagulation , down-regulation anticoagulant mechanism enhance platelet aggregation may trigger atheroma 's instability , plaque rupture thrombus formation . Systemic coagulation abnormality include clot activation inhibition anticoagulant factor observe patient severe sepsis ; patient CAP similar change detect lung compartment . Changes clot system activation potential relevance could elicit myocardial damage several mechanism include coronary ischemia and/or direct inflammation cardiac cell . Concerning last point interest Protein C , anticoagulant factor anti-inflammatory property , reduce severe sepsis correlate disease severity mortality . Accordingly , infusion recombinant human activate Protein C improve survival patient severe sepsis due pneumococcal pneumonia . Until data exists behavior Protein C patient CAP interplay myocardial damage . Moreover data platelet reactivity activation pneumonia exist . Very limited data available common viral respiratory tract infection enhance platelet reactivity show . The investigator speculate inhibition Protein C well enhance platelet activity may implicate myocardial damage patient CAP . Therefore investigator perform prospective study investigate whether relationship exist . Data obtain could important clinical consequence : new therapeutic strategy target system could prevent myocardial damage eventually MACCEs patient .</detailed_description>
