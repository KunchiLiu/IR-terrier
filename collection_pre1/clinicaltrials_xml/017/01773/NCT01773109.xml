	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 study design characterize objective response rate ( define complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) ) Etirinotecan pegol ( NKTR-102 ) administer subject metastatic recurrent NSCLC failure 2nd line therapy . Up 37 eligible subject enrol University Pennsylvania . One cycle define 3 week . Patients follow clinically every week first cycle laboratory parameter physical exam . Response determine RECIST version1.1 2 cycle therapy . Patients stable disease ( SD ) , PR CR continue treatment six cycle . Those benefit six cycle option continue treatment . Patients progressive disease take study follow OS data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm metastatic recurrent NSCLC . Primary metastatic site may use histology . After failure 2nd line treatment two prior line therapy , one may oral TKI . Measurable disease ( Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document incontrovertibly either radiographically pathologically . For clinician rely biopsy documentation recurrence , must obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Age time study entry ≥ 18 year . Adequate hematologic function define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μL , hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL , platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL obtain within 2 week prior enrollment . Adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 × upper limit normal ( [ ULN ] ) , ≤ 5 × ULN presence know liver metastasis . Alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) ≤ 3 x ULN ≤ 5 × ULN presence know liver metastasis Adequate renal function define serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN . If creatinine ULN , patient 's measure calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) must ≥ 50 mL/min . Resolution chemotherapy radiation therapy related toxicity NCICTCAE version 4.0 Grade 1 low severity , except diarrhea ( must Grade 0 without supportive antidiarrheal medication ) alopecia ( grade ) . Women childbearing potential sexually active male must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior enrollment duration study participation . Protections pregnancy must continue least 8 month last dose study drug . Signed informed consent . Untreated central nervous system metastasis . Patients eligible clinically stable , steroids cranial irradiation ( whole brain radiation therapy , focal radiation therapy , stereotactic radio surgery ) end least 2 week prior enrollment , surgical resection perform least 2 week prior enrollment . History another `` active '' invasive primary cancer require ongoing treatment . Concurrent treatment anticancer therapy , include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy , chemoembolization , target therapy , investigational agent . Patients chemotherapy within 21 day ( 42 day nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) , radiotherapy within 14 day , biological therapy within 14 day , hormonal therapy within 7 day , investigational therapy within 21 day prior enrollment . Patients major surgery within 21 day prior enrollment . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection require parenteral antibiotic , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients chronic acute GI disorder result diarrhea severity grade ; patient use chronic antidiarrheal supportive care ( 3 days/week ) control diarrhea 28 day prior enrolment . Administration CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor , may induce inhibit irinotecan SN38 metabolism within 14 day prior cycle 1 throught study treatment . For list agent , see : http : //www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm Uncontrolled thrombotic hemorrhagic disorder .
