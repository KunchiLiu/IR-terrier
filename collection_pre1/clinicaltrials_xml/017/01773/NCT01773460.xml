	<detailed_description>With continuation endocrine treatment breast cancer adaptive upregulation different signal cascade include PI3K/akt/mTOR pathway result cell growth stimulation result resistance endocrine therapy . One way restore endocrine sensitivity inhibition mTOR pathway combination endocrine therapy lead increase PFS compare endocrine therapy alone . Guidelines recommend sequential treatment different endocrine therapy . It therefore appear reasonable explore sensitivity restore change subsequent endocrine combination partner Everolimus case failure combine endocrine-everolimus therapy .</detailed_description>
