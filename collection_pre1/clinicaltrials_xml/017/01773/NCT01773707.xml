	<brief_summary>The study 2-arm , multicenter , 1:1 randomize , placebo control clinical trial . All subject receive close monitoring development AGT T1DM . Subjects receive Abatacept placebo close monitoring development AGT T1DM . To assess safety , efficacy , mode action Abatacept prevent AGT T1DM . The primary objective determine whether intervention Abatacept prevent delay development AGT at-risk autoantibody positive non-diabetic relative patient T1DM . Secondary outcome include : effect Abatacept incidence T1DM ; analyse C-peptide measure OGTT ; safety tolerability ; mechanistic outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Purpose Rationale : In study , relative confirm two antibody , include mIAA , normal glucose tolerance eligible randomization experimental treatment placebo group aim determine whether experimental treatment prevent delay occurrence abnormal glucose tolerance type 1 diabetes mellitus . Individuals normal glucose tolerance earlier disease process ; , less beta cell destruction abnormal glucose tolerance frank diabetes , yet inevitably progress clinical disease essentially complete beta cell loss . Treatment early stage population inevitably progress type 1 diabetes provide great opportunity clinically important impact disease prevention . With abnormal glucose tolerance rather diabetes primary endpoint , study participant , regulator , funders , investigator able determine whether therapy alter disease progression . Therefore , rationale study individual immunologic marker T1DM normal glucose tolerance inevitably develop clinical T1DM . Prior development clinical T1DM progress normal glucose tolerance abnormal glucose tolerance ; abnormal glucose tolerance result clinical T1DM within 5 year almost 80 % subject . They condition differs overt diabetes duration autoimmune process result beta cell destruction . Intervention early course disease may effective intervention abnormal glucose tolerance clinical T1DM . Description Treatment Groups Subjects randomize receive either Abatacept placebo infusion along close monitor abnormal glucose tolerance diabetes . The infusion conduct approved TrialNet clinical site appropriate facility . All blood serum sample primary secondary outcome determination send Core Laboratories analysis . Clinical laboratory study may do local site . Participants randomly assign 1:1 ratio ( within two stratum define age enrollment : &lt; 18 18 old ) follow 2 group : - receive Abatacept ( intravenous infusion 0 , 2 , 4 week follow randomization , every 28+/-7 day ) thereafter total 14 dos . Close monitoring diabetes development duration study . - receive placebo intravenous infusion 0 , 2 , 4 week follow randomization every 28+/- 7 day thereafter total 14 dos . Close monitoring diabetes development duration study . Treatment Assignment After participant sign consent form , complete screen visit ( ) , meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , participant randomize receive either Abatacept close monitor placebo close monitoring . Participants randomize equal allocation group . The randomization method stratify TrialNet study site whether participant le 18 year age 18 year old . This approach ensure study site potential confounder . The TNCC generate randomization number table . Study Assessments During course study , participant frequently undergo assessment glucose tolerance status , insulin production , immunologic status , overall health well-being . Samples draw storage National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Disease ( NIDDK ) Repository TrialNet Laboratory Sites future analysis relate T1DM . Study Duration The study design provide 80 % power detect 40 % risk reduction occurrence abnormal glucose tolerance use two-sided test 0.05 level six year study duration . A total approximately 206 patient allocate 1:1 ratio two group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant TrialNet Natural History/Pathway Prevention Study thus , relative proband T1DM . Between age 145 year time enrollment TN01 age ≥ 6 time randomization trial . Willing provide Informed Consent parent legal guardian provide inform consent subject &lt; 18 year age . Normal glucose tolerance OGTT confirm within 7 week ( 52 day ) baseline ( visit 0 ) . If previous abnormal glucose tolerance , two consecutive OGTTs normal glucose tolerance . 1 . Fasting plasma glucose &lt; 110 mg/dL ( 6.1 mmol/L ) , 2 . 2 hour plasma glucose &lt; 140 mg/dL ( 7.8 mmol/L ) , 3 . 30 , 60 , 90 minute value OGTT &lt; 200mg/dL ( 11.1 mmol/L ) At least two diabetesrelated autoantibody confirm present two occasion , include mIAA . Confirmation 2 positive autoantibody must occur within six month prior randomization , confirmation involve 2 autoantibody . Weight ≥ 20 kg Baseline Visit . If female participant reproductive potential , willing avoid pregnancy undergo pregnancy test prior infusion . At least three month date last live immunization . Willing forgo live vaccine receive treatment study three month follow last study drug administration . Abnormal Glucose Tolerance Diabetes 1 . Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 110 mg/dL ( 6.1 mmol/L ) , 2 . 2 hour plasma glucose ≥ 140 mg/dL ( 7.8 mmol/L ) , 3 . 30 , 60 , 90 minute plasma glucose OGTT ≥ 200 mg/dL ( 11.1 mmol/L ) Insulin autoantibody ( mIAA ) . Are immunodeficient clinically significant chronic lymphopenia . Have active infection time randomization . Have positive PPD test result history previously treat TB , positive interferongamma release assay ( IGRA ) test . Be currently pregnant lactating , anticipate get pregnant within 3 month last study drug administration . Use medication know influence glucose tolerance . Require use immunosuppressive agent . Have serologic evidence current past HIV , Hepatitis B ( positive Hepatitis B core antibody surface antigen ) , Hepatitis C infection . Have serological evidence current CMV infection . Have evidence active EBV infection . Have complicate medical issue abnormal clinical laboratory result interfere study conduct cause increase risk . These include preexist cardiac disease , COPD , neurological , blood count abnormality ( lymphopenia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia ) .</criteria>
