	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention , case , GVAX vaccine , work prevent MDS AML relapse allogeneic stem cell transplantation . `` Investigational '' mean vaccine still study research doctor try find it-such side effect may cause , vaccine effective . It also mean FDA yet approve vaccine type cancer . You ask participate trial advanced myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Your doctor determine candidate allogeneic stem cell transplant treatment MDS/AML . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation standard treatment MDS/AML . It effective cell donor ( also know graft ) could form new immune system fight MDS/AML cell body . This also know `` graft-versus-leukemia '' `` GVL '' effect . In patient advanced MDS AML remission time transplantation , case , relapse remain number one cause transplant failure . As , clinical trial design ass whether add leukemia vaccine early transplantation could stimulate donor cell fight cancer improve transplant outcome . In recent year , researcher Dana-Farber Cancer Institute discover GVAX , vaccine make patient 's cancer cell engineer produce protein call GM-CSF , effective stimulating powerful immune response specific cancer . GM-CSF naturally occur hormone body help immune system fight infection disease . The GVAX vaccine make laboratory use virus ( call adenovirus , modify cause illness ) insert GM-CSF gene tumor cell . The cell irradiate , prevents able grow , administer patient series vaccination . A previous phase I clinical trial use GVAX vaccine patient MDS/AML allogeneic transplantation demonstrate GVAX vaccine safe , survival outcome encourage . The current randomized phase II study investigate vaccine gather information ass activity . If participate research study , `` randomize '' receive either GVAX vaccination placebo ( saline solution ) vaccination . Randomization mean put group chance . It like flip coin . There 50 % chance receive GVAX vaccine 50 % chance receive placebo . Neither transplant doctor ( ) know receive . The primary goal trial ass difference percentage cancer free survivor vaccinate vs. placebo group 18 month transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial divide four phase : 1 ) Pre-Transplant ; 2 ) Allogeneic Transplant ; 3 ) Vaccination ; 4 ) Post-Vaccination Follow-Up . Phase 1 : Pre-Transplant After sign consent form undergo screening test find research study . These test include medical history , physical examination , performance status , bone marrow aspirate biopsy , blood test , tuberculosis skin test , HLA antibody test , pregnancy test , urine test , ECHO , MUGA RVG measure heart function , chest x-ray , pulmonary function test dental consult . If test show eligible participate research study , enrol trial randomize receive either GVAX vaccine placebo vaccine transplant . After enrol study undergo additional research procedure include blood draw leukemia cell collection . Phase 2 : Allogeneic Transplant The transplant phase study begin admit hospital receive chemotherapy stem cell transplant . In week receive stem cell , treat chemotherapy . The combination chemotherapy give donor cell infuse call condition regimen . The chemotherapy condition give suppress immune system donor blood stem cell reject transplantation . The chemotherapy may also reduce number MDS/AML cancer cell body . In study condition regimen include 2 chemotherapy drug : busulfan ( twice day four time day 4 day ) fludarabine ( daily 4 day ) . Depending age clinical factor , transplant doctor decide whether receive high low dose busulfan . Between 1-2 day finish chemotherapy , receive blood stem cell marrow donor . This give transfusion central intravenous line ( IV usually place chest arm ) . Just prior immediately follow infusion stem cell , receive medication help prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , common complication transplant donor 's immune cell attack body . The medication receive prevent GVHD include Tacrolimus Methotrexate . You closely monitor per standard transplant care stem cell transplant . If receive high dose chemotherapy conditioning , stay hospital average 3-4 week . If receive low dose conditioning transplant , hospital admission transplant may shorter depend clinical condition . After stem cell infusion , may receive daily injection medication call rhGM-CSF , Leukine , help white blood cell recover fast . You may receive medication 2 week . You also give antiviral antibiotic medication prevent infection per standard practice transplantation . Between 20 30 day stem cell infusion physical examination , routine blood work blood draw future immune test . Between 30 45 day transplant return clinic visit include physical examination , routine blood work , blood draw future immune test bone marrow biopsy aspirate ass MDS/AML . Phase 3 : Vaccination You may begin receive GVAX placebo vaccination 30 45 day follow transplant , provide blood count recover , severe side effect transplant . If day 46 , blood count recover sufficiently , develop side effect GVHD transplant , meet condition necessary start vaccination portion trial , receive vaccination remove study . You continue receive standard post transplant care . If able begin vaccination day 30-45 transplant , GVAX placebo vaccine administer injection skin forearm thighs , 6 time period 9 week . The first 3 vaccination administer week 3 consecutive week last 3 vaccine give every week 6 week . All vaccination give outpatient clinic . On day receive vaccination , may wait several hour clinic laboratory make final preparation vaccine/placebo . During 9 week period vaccination , continue follow doctor least weekly basis monitor transplant possible vaccine side effect . Before first fifth vaccination , small amount leukemia cell ( previously collect transplant kill radiation ) inject skin ( like TB test ) see body react cause redness and/or swell . This call delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) test . Two three day DTH test , would encourage ( require ) return clinic skin biopsy DTH injection site . This allow researcher assess whether new immune system react injected leukemia cell microscope . At time , may perform skin biopsy GVAX/Placebo vaccination site , especially redness swell area . During course study , also draw blood regular basis evaluate immune cell effect vaccination may new immune system . If tolerate vaccination well , GVHD severe side effect transplant vaccination , complete total 6 vaccine . However , vaccination may terminate early develop side effect ( transplant vaccination ) resolve/improve 2 week , develop GVHD require steroid treatment , MDS/AML relapse need receive treatment . Phase 4 : Post Vaccination Follow-UP About 1 month last vaccination , physical examination , blood work , immune blood bone marrow biopsy aspirate ass status disease . You follow appointment 6 , 9 , 12 18 month follow transplant physical examination , blood work immune blood . At 12 18 month visit bone marrow biopsy aspirate ass status AML/MDS .</detailed_description>
