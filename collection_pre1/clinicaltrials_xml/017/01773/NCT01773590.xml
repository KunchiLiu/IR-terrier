	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate mechanism interplay allergy ( IgE Th2 mediate inflammation ) virus infection development asthma , well risk severity acute exacerbation asthma . Understanding mechanism identify new approach novel therapy prevention asthma development prevention/treatment asthma exacerbation . Such treatment potential major impact patient quality life result enormous reduction health care cost . A human model use identify dysregulated genes/proteins determine relationship disease outcomes . This study compare low airway response asthmatic healthy control subject undergoing rhinovirus ( RV ) experimental infection ( subject infect rhinovirus part study ) . This dual advantage investigate mechanisms natural model possible , well develop good model test novel therapeutic approach . The investigator analyse sample subject group , determine relevance human disease . Any genes/proteins show dysregulated related disease outcomes human model strong candidate immediate translation human intervention study . Up 12 asthmatic and/or healthy subject recruit preliminary pilot study . These subject ineligible enter main study due presence neutralize antibody RV16 ( ~50 % subject otherwise suitable study ) . These subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion main study . The 12 participant undergo test include single bronchoscopy , nasal sample blood test allow optimisation sample processing technique . They infect RV-16 . In main study investigator aim study 15 healthy volunteer 15 volunteer moderate asthma ( inhaled steroid treatment ) . Subjects undergo single baseline bronchoscopy 2 week prior inoculation RV16 virus . Following infection virus participant require attend regular sample collection include 2 bronchoscopies post-infection . Patients follow convalescence 6 week post infection .</brief_summary>
