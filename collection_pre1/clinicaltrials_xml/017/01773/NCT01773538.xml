	<brief_summary>The investigator wish investigate Continuous Reaction Time ( CRT ) method use diagnosis monitoring covert hepatic encephalopathy ( cHE ) patient cirrhosis liver . The hypothesis CRT method ( duration 10-2 minute ) serve tool diagnosis monitoring cHE alternative use Portosystemic Encephalopathy Test ( PSE ) ( duration 20-25 minute ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Covert/Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy Means Continuous Reaction Time Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The aim project investigate whether continuous reaction time measurement ( CRT ) suitable screen monitoring tool covert hepatic encephalopathy ( c/mHE ) . Method : Sub-protocol 1 : As part PhD protocol 100 healthy individual 50 chronic disease ( liver cirrhosis ) test use CRT PSE test . This determine normal range PSE test Danish population . Sub-protocol 2 : A total 120 ( aprox . 145 adjust drop out ) patient liver cirrhosis two Danish hospital examine CRT test closest get gold standard , namely portosystemic encephalopathy test ( PSE ) . We wish examine CRT test agree PSE test , may time consume perform everyday clinical practice , quality life score ( SF-36 Sickness Impact Profile ) . The relationship CRT PSE test various blood test Charlston co-morbidity score also examine . Sub-protocol 3 : Forty-four 120 included patient , regardless CRT test result , randomize treatment lactulose , rifaximin branch chain amino acid ( BCAA ) placebo lactulose , rifaximin BCAA . This evaluate whether CRT method able detect response treatment , see change psychometric test ( PSE CRT ) accordance quality life score predict subsequent development overt hepatic encephalopathy . Perspective : CRT method , prove good enough , continue Danish test choice hopefully widely used country . The validation test diagnosis covert hepatic encephalopathy give cirrhotic patient covert hepatic encephalopathy reduce quality life best opportunity diagnose offer appropriate treatment . If CRT method able identify population benefit anti-encephalopathy treatment screen monitoring test use .</detailed_description>
