	<brief_title>Detrusor Contraction During Ice-water-test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ice-water-test ( IWT ) first described 1957 Bors Blinn think differentiate lesion upper low motoneuron . In cat study , show IWT C-fiber mediate low motoneuron segmental reflex unmyelinated C fiber associate cold receptor . This explain positive IWT patient upper motoneuron lesion . In healthy human , IWT positive age 4 year becomes negative thereafter since reflex centrally inhibit . However , reflex might unmask neurological disease and/or injury . Considering C-fibers involve pathogenesis detrusor overactivity , IWT seem useful diagnostic tool daily practice . However , although many study publish IWT , unclear whether detrusor contraction IWT provoke ice water whether might cause rapid filling . Therefore , design randomize , double-blind trial .</detailed_description>
