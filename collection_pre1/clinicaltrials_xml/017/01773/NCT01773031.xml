	<brief_title>Pancreatic Duct Evaluation Autoimmune Pancreatitis : MR Pancreatography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoimmune pancreatitis ( AIP ) unique form chronic pancreatitis cause autoimmune mechanism respond well steroid therapy . One important issue AIP distinguish pancreatic cancer treatment totally different . An accurate differentiation AIP pancreatic cancer therefore crucial . Two important image finding AIP pancreatic enlargement pancreatic ductal stricture . When CT show typical diffuse sausage-like swell pancreas peripancreatic hypodense rim , easy differentiate AIP pancreatic cancer . However , typical case common , moreover , 30 % AIP manifest focal mass/enlargement pancreas , make differential diagnosis difficult . When pancreatic feature atypical CT , important find diffuse multifocal stricture main pancreatic duct characteristic feature AIP . In AIP , diffusely attenuate pancreatic duct thinner normal , appear CT. Pancreatography therefore necessary . Two current imaging tool demonstrate pancreatic duct endoscopic retrograde pancreatography ( ERP ) MR pancreatography ( MRP ) . ERP provide high resolution image use different projection enable various procedure include aspiration/biopsy stent insertion . However , use diagnostic ERP diagnose AIP debate ERP invasive procedure , potential complication include pancreatitis , perforation stomach duodenum . Moreover , difficult perform endoscopic procedure patient underwent gastric surgery . Whereas , MRP noninvasively image pancreatic biliary system time without risk procedure-related complication evaluate intrabdominal organ cross-sectional image . The relatively low spatial resolution MRP use 1.5 T compare ERP image may make difficult demonstrate fine change pancreatic duct AIP sometimes make false positive negative finding . The superiority 3.0 T 1.5 T MR system observe several study . However , study use 3.0 T MR system pancreaticobiliary tract report , furthermore , usefulness 3.0 T MRP diagnosis AIP yet investigate . The purpose study prospectively compare image quality MRP 3.0 T 1.5 T patient AIP use ERP reference standard .</detailed_description>
