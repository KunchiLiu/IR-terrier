	<brief_summary>Current Canadian Clinical Practice guideline emphasize need effective psychosocial adjunct pharmacotherapy schizophrenia ( Canadian Psychiatric Association 2005 ) . This randomize control trial seek contribute body evidence support psychosocial treatment assess effectiveness metacognitive training ( MCT ) cognitive remediation ( CR ) treat persistent positive cognitive symptom schizophrenia . MCT therapy design improve patient awareness insight cognitive bias frequently see schizophrenia ; associate decreased psychopathology ( specifically decrease positive symptom ) improve psychosocial function . CR therapy design improve performance variety neurocognitive function attention , memory , executive functioning ; associate improved cognitive psychosocial functioning . Both MCT CR compare treatment usual ( TAU ) do previously ( Kumar er al. , 2010 ; Moritz et al. , 2011 ) . Hypotheses : 1 . MCT produce great change delusion ( severity conviction ) CR TAU . 2 . CR MCT produce great change social/everyday function TAU . 3 . CR produce great improvement basic attention memory measure relative MCT TAU . 4 . MCT produce great reduction task measure target reason bias relative CR TAU . 5 . CR increase efficiency functional network work memory task relative MCT TAU . 6 . MCT lead great decrease neural response evidence match relative CR TAU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The objective research project ass relative effectiveness MCT CR treat persistent positive symptom schizophrenia stable patient population . Specifically , use verify measure examine impact intervention delusion conviction severity , well feature interest , include insight specific cognitive bias . We use functional neuroimaging , electroencephalography ( EEG ) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , measure change neural response subject perform various cognitive task . It expect improvement cognitive performance function see MCT CR correlate select improvement efficiency particular brain network . We anticipate double dissociation , subject decrease positive symptom follow MCT may present different pattern activation improve neurocognitive function follow CR . Procedures : Recruitment do inpatient outpatient department Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada . Diagnosis schizophrenia spectrum disorder confirm use MINI ( Sheehan , 1998 ) . Both inpatient outpatient recruit ; patient must identify suitable , determine treat psychiatric team . This suffice obtain 50 subject per condition 5 year . Participants complete screen baseline ( pre-treatment ) assessment randomly assign one 3 condition : 1 ) MCT , 2 ) CR , 3 ) TAU . Randomization subject occur complete baseline assessment , entry group involve roll intake model . Interventions administer twice weekly 8 week . The group run Clinical Psychologists PhD level psychology student . Allied health professional , Occupational Therapists Social Workers , may co-facilitate group . Baseline ( pre-treatment ) , midpoint , post-treatment assessment include symptom cognitive assessment , well self-reported measure , outline . Patients willing eligible also involve three task record fMRI data EEG data . fMRI scanning : Participants prepare EEG train graduate student , research staff , fMRI technician . Once scanner , subject perform three cognitive task use extensively previous research . EEG recording : Participants prepare EEG train graduate student research staff . The subject perform cognitive task fMRI procedure . Measurements : Symptom Ratings : General psychopathology assess use Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ; Andreasen , 1984 ) Scale Assessment Positive Symptoms ( SAPS ; Andreasen , 1984 ) . Delusion severity measure use Delusions Scale Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales ( PSYRATS ; Haddock , McCarron , Tarrier , &amp; Faragher , 1999 ) . All symptom rating scale administer trained raters blind treatment allocation subject . Self-Report Measures : Patient depressive symptom measure use Beck Depression Inventory , Second Edition ( BDI-II , Beck , 1996 ) . Patient perception quality life measure use World Health Organisation Quality Life scale ( WHOQoL ) . Patient perception stigma impact quality life measure use Internalized Stigma Mental Illness scale ( ISMI ; Ritsher et al. , 2003 ) . Patient perception self self-esteem measure use Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale ( RSES ; Rosenberg , 1965 ) . Cognitive Biases MCT psychosis fundamentally concerned dysfunctional thinking psychotic illness directly target cognitive bias know involved delusional thinking include jump conclusion bias , attributional bias , bias disconfirmatory evidence . Two cognitive bias commonly see schizophrenia evaluate use `` jumping conclusion ( JTC ) task '' ( also know `` fisherman '' task ) `` bias disconfirmatory evidence ( BADE ) '' task . These task develop , part , Principal Investigator describe previous research ( Lecomte &amp; Woodward , 2005 ; Woodward 2006a ; Woodward 2006b ; Woodward 2007 ; Moritz &amp; Woodward 2005 ; Woodward 2009 ) . The test Premorbid Function ( ToPF ) word-reading task use estimate premorbid intelligence ( IQ ) individual ( Wechsler , 2011 ) . The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence , Second Edition ( WASI-II ; Wechsler , 2011 ) provide measure current intelligence ( IQ ) . The Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ; Randolph , 1998 ) use review neurocognitive function individual , include attention , process speed , work memory , verbal visual memory . The trailmaking test provide measure basic attention , speed processing , mental flexibility , executive functioning ( Reitan , 1992 ) . The Controlled Oral Word Association test ( COWAT ; Benton et al. , 1994 ) verbal fluency task measure executive function . Insight The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale ( BCIS ; Beck , Baruch , Balter , Steer , &amp; Warman , 2004 ) administer evaluate patient ' degree insight cognitive bias limitation . Functional Neuroimaging Electroencephalography Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Electroencephalography ( EEG ) use assess relative involvement activation different neural network . The Sternberg Working Memory Task use order quantify level efficiency neural network responsible work memory ( Metzak et al. , 2012 ) . Two Evidence Matching Tasks ( e.g. , `` fish task '' `` bias discomfirmatory evidence ( BADE ) task '' ) use order quantify reactivity neural network responsible evidence matching ( e.g. , anterior-cingulate-based network ; Woodward et al. , 2008 ) . Feedback Participants After final session active treatment condition , patient ask complete questionnaire comprise 10 question acceptance subjective efficacy ( Moritz &amp; Woodward 2007a ) . Data accumulate therein use together frequency unattended session establish acceptability feasibility various treatment condition . Statistical Analysis Rolling group intake facilitation allow two four , two-month cycle condition per year 5 year , allow u obtain 50 subject per condition ( MCT , CR , TAU ) , sufficient produce power 0.8 detect large effect three group mean comparison design ( Cohen 1992 ) use p=0.05 cutoff significance .</detailed_description>
