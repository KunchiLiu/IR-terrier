	<brief_title>Utility Study Primovist-MRI HCC Staging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one leading cause cancer relate death worldwide , incidence continue rise even Europe United States . Recent advancement early diagnosis treatment modality significantly improve survival HCC patient , , small portion receive curative treatment . Treatment decision make HCC guide tumor stage , also affect tumor status presentation.Thus , intrahepatic tumor status pivotal treatment decision make determine prognosis HCC patient , especially possible candidate curative treatment . The current AASLD guideline recommend HCC patient typical HCC ≥1 cm liver dynamic compute tomography ( CT ) require investigation confirm presence HCC , appropriate treatment initiate base tumor stage . However , intrahepatic HCC lesion detect liver dynamic CT additionally detect Primovist-enhanced MRI.Although study evaluate usefulness Primovist-enhanced MRI HCC patient , study limit lack evaluation shift HCC stage inclusion patient suspicious intrahepatic HCC lesion already detect liver dynamic CT . Furthermore , give poor prognosis HCC patient recurrence curative treatment liver transplantation , surgical resection , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , accurate staging workup essential intrahepatic HCC , especially patient early early Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stag HCC . To date , however , evidence base recommendation make regard benefit add-on examination Primovist-enhanced MRI initial stag workups HCC patient candidate curative treatment diagnosis liver dynamic CT . In prospective multicenter study , therefore , assess usefulness Primovist-enhanced MRI initial stag workups HCC patient early early stage disease , suspicious intrahepatic HCC lesion liver dynamic CT. We examine whether Primovist-enhanced MRI could provide additional information BCLC stage , directly compare liver dynamic CT patient . Furthermore , ass whether add-on Primovist-enhanced MRI diagnosis HCC liver dynamic CT could aid treatment decision making patient .</detailed_description>
