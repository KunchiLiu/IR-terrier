	<brief_summary>Individuals bipolar disorder ( BD ) experience extreme mood swing , episode depression ( hypo ) mania . These episode associate poor functioning , bad course illness , high rate suicidality . It estimate 25 65 % individual BD attempt suicide 4 19 % individual BD eventually die suicide . Sleep disturbance identify primary prodromal well causal symptom mood episode recently , find associate high rate suicidal ideation behavior . Given role sleep may mood stability suicidality BD , seem imperative understand association sleep suicide sleep intervention may useful reduce suicidality BD . Thus , primary aim study use innovative home sleep monitoring device , Embla , examine association sleep suicidality adult outpatient BD . The Embla unique non-invasive device characterize sleep profile measure degree sleep fragmentation percentage rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep . The study duration five six week patient wear Embla device Week 1 , participate brief sleep intervention suicide Weeks 2 3 , 4 , wear Embla device one week ( Week 5 ) . This intervention consist three , 60-min session utilizes cognitive-behavioral therapy strategy ( e.g. , psychoeducation , cognitive re-structuring , problem solving , behavioral activation ) improve sleep disturbance . The investigator expect individual study entry sleep disturbance ( measure Embla ) report suicidal ideation behavior . The investigator also hypothesize pre- post-intervention , individual report less sleep disturbance well suicidal ideation behavior . Data research immediate practical implication provider patient first examination sleep phenotype suicide high risk population well explore association improvement sleep suicidality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder characterize episode depression well episodes mania ( abnormally high mood ) . Individuals bipolar disorder experience high rate suicidal ideation behavior , risk death due suicide estimate 20 time great general population . Moreover , research suggest among individual treat bipolar disorder , approximately 40 % report past suicide attempt . Other study suggest 25 65 % patient bipolar disorder attempt suicide 4 19 % individual successful . Among DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorder , suicide appear high bipolar disorder . Individuals bipolar disorder great likelihood current past suicidal ideation anxiety disorder , early age onset , severe course illness . Nevertheless , continue need information epidemiology risk factor suicidal ideation behavior population . Several study show sleep difficulty ( i.e. , insomnia , hypersomnia , poor sleep quality , nightmare ) significantly associate suicidal ideation , even control depression . These disturbance well document episode depression mania , sleep disturbance also show persist period relative mood stability . A common symptom bipolar patient experience manic episode reduce need sleep , several study use polysomnography identify decreased REM sleep latency manic episode . Utilizing self-report measure , study bipolar patient depressive episode identify variable rate hypersomnia insomnia common factor . However , research conduct use laboratory-based polysomnography depressive episode report disparate finding . This proposal involve test novel measure sleep architecture patient bipolar disorder , use newly available home sleep monitoring device call Embla ( www.embla.com ) . This device stick skin chest standard EKG-adhesive sticker capture electrocardiogram ( EKG ) sleep . The Embla device also measure movement , snore , body position , light level . The on-board storage allow 2-3 week nightly record . By use unobtrusive potentially informative measure sleep architecture , protocol allow longitudinal , objective information sleep disturbance compare corresponding mood state patient bipolar disorder . Overall , protocol investigate relationship suicidality sleep disturbance well assess whether brief CBT intervention sleep disturbance associate reduce suicidal ideation and/or behavior . Since research suggest CBT effective adjunct treatment reduce suicidality population , treatment insomnia improve sleep individual bipolar disorder , present research important implication prevention intervention suicide vulnerable population . To investigator knowledge , investigation look effectiveness CBT sleep suicidality bipolar disorder . Furthermore , past research rely almost exclusively subjective report sleep , study capture subjective objective measure sleep .</detailed_description>
