	<brief_summary>The propose research potential contributing limited empirical literature relationship maternal sensitivity motor development preterm infant . If indeed maternal attuned behavior find associated quality motor development , find support effectiveness physical therapy guide caregiver attune hold touch preterm infant . We hypothesize mother infant ' attunement observe interaction relate quality preterm infant ' spontaneous movement follow way : First , good maternal attunement infant need , particular attunement hold touch associate good quality spontaneous movement infant . Second , initiation and/or involvement infant interaction associate well maternal attunement infant . Third , initiation and/or involvement infant interaction associate well quality spontaneous movement well achievement developmental milestone . All hypothesis examine control maternal use SSC method hospitalization birth family demographic background .</brief_summary>
