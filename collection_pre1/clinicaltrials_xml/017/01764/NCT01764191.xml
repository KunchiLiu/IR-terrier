	<brief_summary>This study design provide patient suspected cardiac sarcoidosis ( CS ) potentially diagnostic 18F FDG PET/CT . CS difficult diagnose currently available method , therefore project allow access 18F FDG PET/CT scanning , may accurately diagnose presence CS . This study also provide additional data examine effectiveness safety profile 18F FDG condition . Accurate early detection important allow well management CS improve patient care . The purpose study provide access 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging patient clinical suspicion cardiac sarcoidosis , collect additional data safety effectiveness 18F-FDG PET/CT patient population</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : The purpose study provide access 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging patient clinical suspicion cardiac sarcoidosis , collect additional data safety effectiveness 18F-FDG PET/CT patient population . 2 . Hypothesis:18F-FDG PET/CT great sensitivity , specificity , accuracy compare current clinical gold standard diagnosis CS , Japanese Ministry Health , Labour , Welfare ( MHLW ) guideline 3 . Justification : Currently clinical diagnosis CS diagnose use combination diagnostic technique include image biopsy . Biopsies challenge difficult locate disease access desire biopsy location . MRI proven effective limited patient pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillators patient renal impairment unable MRI . Finally radionuclide scintigraphy Gallium-67 Thallium-201 ( 201Tl ) useful , non-specific sarcoidosis . 18F-FDG PET/CT significant advantage radionuclide image modality due superior resolution PET couple affinity inflammatory cardiac tissue metabolize FDG . 18F-FDG PET/CT find high sensitivity specificity conventionally use image modality . 4 . Research Method : This expand access study adult subject clinical suspicion CS invite participate , order identify potential site biopsy provide confirmation presence CS . Based population extrapolation diagnose suspected case CS British Columbia ( BC ) , well expert clinical opinion , estimate 10 15 patient per year enrol study . Over three year period , expect sample size 30 - 45 patient . All subject receive 18F-FDG PET/CT BC Cancer Agency ( BCCA ) - Vancouver Centre . 5 . Statistical Analysis : The planned sample size 150 patient . The primary endpoint provide PET/CT image patient diagnose suspected CS . The secondary end-point ass sensitivity , specificity accuracy 18F-FDG PET BC population . Confidence interval 95 % use ass use exact binomial distribution . All analysis perform direct consultation qualify statistician . Sensitivity ( ratio true positive lesion total positive lesion ) , specificity ( ratio true negative lesion total negative lesion ) accuracy ( ratio total correct study total number biopsied lesion ) 18F-FDG PET study perform BCCA obtain compare result PET scan composite outcome clinical examination , histopathological diagnosis , result available , result available imaging ( cardiac MRI , 201Tl , 67Ga ) . Confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) sensitivity , specificity accuracy calculate use exact binomial distribution .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 19 year old . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 3 . Able provide write informed consent . Patients must able tolerate physical/logistical requirement complete PET scan include lie flat 45 minute tolerate intravenous cannulation injection . Clinical suspicion cardiac sarcoidosis , include combination : Patients systemic sarcoidosis symptom suggestive heart failure ( eg . fatigue , dyspnea , edema etc . ) Idiopathic heart failure , particularly preserve systolic function variety Presentation arrhythmia ( eg . heart block , ventricular tachycardia , etc . ) Progressive heart failure symptom respond conventional therapy Other clinical presentation experience treat cardiologist cardiac sarcoid need rule ( ie . Heart transplant ventricular assist device candidacy ) Routine test CS inconclusive , : ECG Holter echocardiogram 67Ga scintigraphy inconclusive Cardiac MRI inconclusive possible conduct Patient renal dysfunction limit radionuclide image . Patients blood glucose &gt; 11.1 mmol/L ( 200 mg/dL ) measure glucometer immediately prior scan . Patients confirm diabetes . Patients unable comply dietary modification prolong fast per trial protocol . Pregnancy . Patients medically unstable eg . acute cardiac respiratory distress , hypotensive . Patients exceed safe weight limit PET/CT bed ( 204.5 kg ) fit PET/CT machine ( diameter 70 cm ) .</criteria>
