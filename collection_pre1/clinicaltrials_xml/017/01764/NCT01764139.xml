	<detailed_description>Introduction Vitamin D deficiency recently link range disease include chronic pain . Range vitamin D level classify deficiency less 50nmols , insufficient 50 75 nmols , adequate 75 150 nmoles , excessive 150nmol . Vitamin D deficiency also identify chronic pain patient present pain clinic Broomfield hospital . Vitamin D deficiency insufficiency common UK . Local audit Chelmsford show severe deficiency vitamin D among chronic pain patient . The major source vitamin D synthesis relies sunlight exposure likely affect modern lifestyle , increasingly work indoors daylight hour . This may particularly important combine residence northern latitude cloudy climate . Observational circumstantial evidence suggest may role vitamin D treatment chronic pain condition . Al-Jarallah &amp; colleague show ( 25 ( OH ) D level 11.4 Â± 6.07 ng/ml . ) 92.9 % vitamin D deficient among Kuwaiti patient primary knee osteoarthritis ( 21 ) . Our aim identify many percentage patient , knee pain , without major abnormal finding deficient vitamin D. If number significant , supplement improve pain ? If correctly supplement patient early enough , prevent deterioration knee joint ? These question may able investigate treat . Currently investigation vitamin D level do patient primary knee osteoarthritis ass relation radiological grade functional status , ass relationship pain . Research Aims , hypotheses We aim identify incidence vitamin D deficiency among knee pain patient . If prof significant , next step organise trial treat patient identify effectiveness adequate supplementation relieve pain . Our aim investigate around 50 patient . Recruitment English speaking patient whose knee pain resolve follow knee arthroscopy invite study . Sample size 50 patient . Patients explain purpose study plain English invitation . After give informed consent , sample blood take '25hydroxy vitamin D ' level . Study carry Broomfield hospital chronic pain department . Inclusion criterion Male &amp; pregnant female age 18-40 yr , continue experience knee pain follow normal Grade 2 knee arthroscopy finding . Exclusion Criteria Any type anatomical neurological cause pain , history seizure , regional pain syndrome , alcohol drug abuse , malignancy , patient clinically significant disease patient understand English exclude . Intervention procedure One blood sample per patient . Data management analysis The proportion patient vitamin D deficiency estimate data correspond 95 % confidence limit calculate use Wilson method . The mean standard deviation vitamin D level estimate data along correspond 95 % confidence limit obtain use bootstrap 999 sample . The statistical distribution vitamin D level also examine . Primary outcome measure study To identify percentage Vitamin D deficiency among knee pain patient</detailed_description>
