	<brief_summary>This bicentric , prospective , non randomize study . Pediatric adult patient treat . Rationale : MSC show promising effect reversal severe therapy-resistant acute GvHD . As common therapeutic line action share steroid resistant GVHD , important establish toxicity feasibility preparation infusion third party MSCs acute steroid resistant GVHD acute phase chronic steroid resistant GVHD . A total 10 patient ( pediatric adult ) need enrol study . Patients present clinical sign either acute chronic steroid resistant GVHD receive intravenous infusion least two fixed dos mesenchymal stem cell 5 7 day interval one , derive HLA unrelated donor different HSC donor ( third party donor ) regardless rate HLA mismatch . Primary objective establish feasibility toxicity preparation infusion third party MSCs treatment steroid resistant acute acute phase chronic grade II-IV GVHD . Secondary objective : 1 . To document efficacy MSC infusion steroid resistant acute acute phase chronic GVHD grade II-IV . 2 . To document rate GVHD recurrence MSCs infuse patient . 3 . To document relapse hematological malignancy post MSC infusion patient undergo MSCs treatment steroid refractory GvHD . 4 . To document overall survival MSC infuse patient steroid refractory GvHD .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Informed consent . 2 . Patients required meet follow inclusion criterion : Any patient undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation steroid refractory grade IIIV acute GvHD either occur post transplant , induce donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) Tcell add back , chronic steroid refractory GVHD acute phase . Patients may receive local best treatment steroid refractory GVHD . A positive biopsy GvHD require clinical sign symptom characteristic GvHD etiology exclude . See 6.4 acute GvHD grading . 1 . Steroids give , instance methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day , least 72h case progressive acute GvHD , 5 day case stable acute GVHD ( grade II IV ) chronic GvHD active phase , accord local policy . 2 . Despite treatment , patient unresponsive GvHD 5 day , progressive acute GvHD 72 hour . If single organ acute GvHD grade II gut liver , either progression single organ addition one two organ . As example , patient grade II acute GvHD skin , GvHD intense widespread , GvHD also include liver and/or gut . 3 . Patients steroid refractory GvHD fulfilling requirement mention ) b ) may treat second line therapy accord clinical guideline center prior enrolment study . 4 . Patients treatment best available local treatment steroid resistant GVHD interrupt ongoing treatment unless clinically require safety reason . 1 . Inability obtain informed consent . 2 . Patients document uncontrolled EBV , CMV fungal infection . 3 . Patients poor clinical condition life expectancy le 30 day .</criteria>
