	<brief_title>Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiographically Guided Management Optimise Outcomes Unstable Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) common form acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) lead global cause premature morbidity mortality . A coronary angiogram recommend intermediate-high risk NSTEMI patient detect obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) identify patient may benefit coronary revascularization . In ACS patient , stress test invasive management recommend functional information ischemia usually available . Therefore , usual care base visual interpretation coronary disease severity reveal angiogram treatment decision include medical therapy , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) . Since visual assessment angiogram may inaccurate , judgement make cardiologist every day practice subjective , potentially leading misdiagnosis incorrect treatment decision . Recent study ( DEFER , FAME , FAME II ) patient stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) present new approach diagnostic management CAD . Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) index physiological significance coronary stenosis define ratio maximal blood flow stenotic artery normal maximal flow . An FFR ≤0.80 evidence-based physiological threshold correlate presence inducible ischemia non-invasive testing . Alternatively , FFR &gt; 0.80 indicate patient manage safely medical therapy . DEFER FAME highlight benefit FFR measurement stable CAD accurately identify flow-limiting stenosis guide PCI lead improve outcome reduce cost compare angiography alone . In FAME 2 , compare optimal medical therapy alone , PCI combine optimal medical therapy reduce likelihood urgent revascularization patient stable symptom functionally significant coronary disease . Overall , FFR measurement identify exclude obstructive coronary artery disease high diagnostic accuracy , include patient prior MI . FFR measurement unstable coronary artery disease There uncertainty validity FFR measure patient recent MI . FFR measurement require maximal coronary hyperemia theoretically may less readily achieve patient recent MI , potentially , microvascular injury . The result several recent study support notion FFR measurement valid medically stabilize MI patient . First , Ntalianis et al measure FFR 112 non-culprit coronary lesion repeatedly ( average interval 35±4 day ) 101 patient recent MI find similar FFR value time-point . In one study , FFR correctly identify inducible ischemia SPECT 57 patient &gt; 6 day MI one study 124 ACS patient , defer revascularization lesion FFR ≥ 0.75 safe long term follow-up . In hospitalized patient recent MI angiographic intermediate coronary lesion , FFR-guided management reduce in-hospital cost compare deferred management revascularization guide myocardial stress perfusion scintigraphy . Finally , nearly one third patient randomize FAME history medically stabilize unstable angina NSTEMI five day randomization . The FAME investigator perform post-hoc analysis patient find similar risk reduction major adverse cardiovascular event FFR group compare angiography-guided group lead conclude benefit use FFR guide PCI multivessel disease may differ patient unstable vs. stable coronary disease . The FAME investigator conclude post hoc analysis could prove equivalence effect subgroup since FAME neither design power . Therefore , potential diagnostic , prognostic health economic impact FFR measurement inform management unselected patient recent ( i.e . &lt; 5 day ) medically stabilize NSTEMI establish . Specific uncertainties angiography-guided treatment decision NSTEMI . First , treatment decision non-obstructive ( FFR &gt; 0.80 ) culprit CAD lack evidence base guide management . On one hand , stent cover rupture coronary plaque might reduce risk recurrent thrombosis . On hand , optimal medical therapy dual anti-platelet drug high dose statin might suffice unnecessary stenting harmful ( e.g . stent thrombosis ) . Second , NSTEMI patient multivessel coronary disease , evidence lack whether non-culprit obstructive lesion undergo revascularization . A post-hoc analysis contemporary large scale Acute Catheterization Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy ( ACUITY ) trial find incomplete coronary revascularization multivariable predictor major adverse cardiac event 1 year risk relate number non-revascularized lesion . A post hoc analysis NSTEMI patient treat usual care find FFR disclosure influence cardiologist ' treatment decision lead improved diagnostic efficiency compare angiography-guided decision . Third , uncertainty remain whether maximal coronary hyperemia achieve patient recent MI use standard dose adenosine ( 140 micrograms/kg/min ) whether high dos adenosine ( 170 - 210 micrograms/kg/min ) might need . This question relevant since sub-maximal coronary vasodilatation could associate falsely elevate FFR value turn could result inappropriate decision favor medical therapy rather revascularization . Rationale trial FFR-guided management vs. angiography alone NSTEMI . FFR measurement current standard care NSTEMI patient . Therefore , study , FFR measure disclose angiography-guided control group . Second , FFR value relationship clinical outcome may differ patient unstable coronary disease compare patient stable coronary disease . In trial , FFR measure patient include angiography-guided control group ( 175 patient ) FFR measure disclosed clinical team responsible patient . Since patient followed-up clinical event , relationship ( ROC value ) FFR health outcome ( composite cardiovascular event ) prospectively evaluate . Third , since stress test appropriate acute MI patient , FFR-guided management could obviate need 'deferred ' management . Fourth , FFR potential guide decision revascularization culprit non-culprit lesion . Since data support stenting lesion functionally significant , investigator propose treatment decision consistently guide FFR value culprit non-culprit artery use establish FFR threshold 0.80 revascularization . Non-flow limiting lesion ( FFR &gt; 0.80 ) would treat optimal medical therapy flow-limiting lesion ( FFR≤0.80 ) revascularized PCI CABG . Fifth , stenting perform , post-stent FFR use ensure optimal stent result achieve i.e . FFR &gt; 0.9 culprit non-culprit lesion treat PCI . Study Hypothesis Routine FFR measurement feasible NSTEMI patient additive diagnostic , clinical health economic utility , compare current standard care base visual assessment angiogram . Methodology Overall aim : To generate evidence permit ( ) development new diagnostic disease management strategy accurately efficiently distinguish flow limit non-flow limit coronary stenosis , major challenge current revascularization strategy patient recent MI direct angiography alone . Primary Aims : 1 ) To determine treatment outcome NSTEMI patient whose management guide FFR disclosure differ compare patient whose treatment guide visual interpretation angiogram alone ( FFR measure , disclose ) . Secondary Aims : 1 . To determine feasibility safety routine coronary guidewire-based FFR measurement NSTEMI , 2 . To determine level agreement functional ( FFR ) visual assessment coronary disease severity NSTEMI patient , 3 . To assess proportion patient clinical response adenosine ( initial dose 140 µg/kg/min , maximum dose 210 µg/kg/min ) , reveal typical change heart rate blood pressure occurrence patient symptom , 4 . To determine relationship FFR value baseline procedure ( receiver operating characteristic ) cardiac event follow-up patient , 5 . To provide preliminary data whether FFR-guided management associate improved health outcome quality life long term compare angiography-guided treatment decision , 6 . To perform health-economic analysis . Standard care NSTEMI patient UK National Health Service The participate hospital adhere current guideline optimal medical therapy optimal revascularization . A left main stenosis &gt; 50 % epicardial coronary stenosis &gt; 70 % usually take obstructive lesion revascularization consider . In usual care , FFR normally measure minority patient ( &lt; 10 % patient overall ) standard care . Patients may candidate CABG discuss Multidisciplinary Heart Team meeting center . If stag PCI clinically indicate procedure take place index hospitalization . Setting Design A prospective randomize control trial conduct 6 UK center include 3 academic cardiothoracic center 3 non-academic regional hospital . Study population The investigator estimate 1400 consecutive NSTEMI patient know suspected Type 1 MI screen coronary angiography . The inclusion exclusion criterion list . Patients give informed consent randomize include follow-up registry . Catheter laboratory study protocol Once coronary angiogram obtain , cardiologist ass whether patient eligible base angiographic criterion continue study randomize . If case , randomization take place immediately catheter laboratory . All eligible patient include wherever possible minimize selection bias . The main angiographic inclusion criterion presence one non-critical coronary stenosis ≥30 % severity ( 1 ) amenable revascularization , ( 2 ) associate normal coronary blood flow ( TIMI grade III ) ( 3 ) opinion attend cardiologist FFR measurement feasible may diagnostic value . Although epicardial coronary stenosis 70 % usually accept threshold revascularization , minimum stenosis severity 30 % adopt FFR measurement study stenosis severity may visually underestimated . Inclusion stenosis &gt; 90 % severity permissible provided cardiologist believe FFR potential influence treatment decision base coronary patient characteristic . Left main stem disease include upper limit stenosis severity 80 % . The pressure wire ( Certus , St Jude Medical , Uppsala ) use provide FFR value across coronary narrowing ≥30 % severity appropriate . Randomization Once coronary angiogram acquire , cardiologist confirm whether patient eligible randomization . In case , randomization cardiologist initially state treatment plan base available clinical information include angiogram . The treatment plan record research team . Next , randomization follow-on immediately use web-based computer randomization tool provide independent Clinical Trials Unit . Ineligible patient enter registry . FFR inform group : FFR measure cardiologist immediately randomization FFR result use guide treatment decision base threshold 0.80 . An FFR ≤ 0.80 result treatment decision revascularization PCI CABG combine optimal medical therapy FFR &gt; 0.80 result treatment optimal medical therapy alone . Changes treatment compare treatment plan prior FFR disclosure record time . Angiography-guided group blinding : The patient clinical team responsible patient , include interventional cardiologist nurse , blind FFR .
