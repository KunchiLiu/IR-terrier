	<brief_summary>Heavy drinking ( HD ) risk factor HIV transmission common HIV+ individual general population . HD adversely affect health directly reduce adherence antiretroviral therapy ( ARTs ) , part due alcohol-induced cognitive impairment . Reduced drink improves cognitive performance adherence ARTs . Medications approve United States treat alcohol dependence small effect size . However , topiramate , FDA-approved anticonvulsant prophylaxis migraine , great effect size reduce drink promote abstinence alcohol dependent individual . To date , study effect topiramate HIV+ heavy drinker . The investigator propose conduct randomize , parallel-groups , placebo-controlled , 11-week trial topiramate 40 HIV+ heavy drinker want reduce stop drinking . There three primary hypothesis feasibility proof-of-concept study . First , investigator hypothesize topiramate-treated patient decrease frequency HD placebo-treated patient . Second , base score computerize neurocognitive assessment , investigator hypothesize topiramate placebo group show similar performance battery cognitive test . Third , base self-reported medication adherence , investigator hypothesize adherence ARTs great topiramate group placebo group . These finding provide preliminary data support definitive trial topiramate treatment HD HIV+ heavy drinker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topiramate Reduce Heavy Drinking HIV-Positive Heavy Drinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . General Design : This study employ 11-week , parallel-groups design ( TOP vs. placebo ) test effect topiramate ( TOP ) HD HIV+ individual current alcohol use disorder . We gradually increase dosage TOP 25 mg/day 150 mg/day 6-week period minimize adverse event . Random assignment treatment group double-blind condition maintain throughout study . B . Recruiting : HIV+ men woman recruit advertisement collaboration physician University Pennsylvania Health System ( UPHS ) invite refer patient heavy drink HIV+ patient create medical concern . Patients recruit use follow method : referral research center University Pennsylvania ( UPenn ) ; posting/distributing recruitment material community setting public post area mean provide community access material ( hospital , town hall , public library , YMCA , health fairs/organizations ) ; advertisement local medium ( include text ad newspaper , magazine ; radio ad local radio station ; web ad internet site web posting community message board research listing ) . These method successful Dr. Kranzler University Pennsylvania many investigator Treatment Research Center ( TRC ) UPenn . The TRC active center clinical investigation staff faculty highly experience capable conduct clinical trial . We use institution-approved recruitment material advertise regular daily drinker HIV+ want reduce drinking . We obtain permission select location distribute post approved recruitment material ( ensure comply institution ' guideline ) . We anticipate approximately 40 % patient woman minority patient represent least proportion general population Philadelphia . Based upon large number potential patient success recruitment prior study , include involve heavy drinker , confident ability achieve recruitment goal . C. Study Visits : At screen visit , patient provide informed consent read ability evaluate , medical psychiatric history obtain . Blood urine sample take routine clinical laboratory evaluation ( include GGTP ) , drug screening , pregnancy test female reproductive potential . Patients interview Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) . Patients exclude referred treatment . The baseline visit occur 1-14 day screen visit . Eligible patient undergo research evaluation , complete packet questionnaire , complete cognitive testing , interview research assistant . A physical examination perform study physician nurse practitioner . Eligible patient receive first counseling session first supply study medication subsequent treatment session day . We use urn randomization , probabilistic balancing procedure assign patient medication group group balance key variable ( Wei 1978 ) : sex , race ( white non-white ) , number HD day past month . During 11-week treatment period , patient return clinic weekly five week dosage medication gradually increase biweekly six week . For patient safety travel , instruct drink prior study visit . At visit , patient 's breath alcohol level , weight , vital sign measure . They complete questionnaire cognitive testing , interview research nurse use concurrent medication , occurrence adverse event , protocol compliance receive medical management intervention . During visit 9 ( end treatment week 11 ) , patient complete questionnaire cognitive test interview research evaluator concern alcohol consumption . Patients compensate end-of-treatment visit . Patients also interview research nurse use concomitant medication , occurrence adverse event , compliance protocol , assessment effectiveness acceptability treatment procedure ( Medication Questionnaire ; MED-Q ) . The nurse dispense 4 day medication taper instruct patient take medication period . Blood sample measure serum GGTP obtain assess validity self-reported drinking . A study nurse research coordinator call patient one week endpoint visit confirm subject complete medication taper . Continuing adverse event follow study nurse physician conclusion , feasible . Patients request ( clearly need ) additional treatment alcohol problem refer local treatment center . All patient ( include discontinue treatment prematurely ) ask complete end-of-treatment evaluation complete schedule assessment facilitate intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analyse . For patient withdraw early wish continue study visits/procedures , end-of-treatment procedure administer time withdrawal . Such patient also ask undergo in-person telephone follow-up end-of-treatment collection remain treatment-phase Timeline Followback ( TLFB ) data . D. Compensation : Patients compensate time transportation . E. Study Treatments : Throughout study , maintain double-blind condition respect medication administration . The research nurse , experience conduct alcohol pharmacotherapy trial , deliver medical management monitor medication , include capsule count measure adherence . The physician meet patient initially , meet least weekly nurse discus progress , evaluate patient event severe persistent adverse effect . The nurse dispense study medication prescribe physician . Patients severe psychological symptom ( e.g. , suicidal thought ) withdraw treatment referred appropriate clinical care . An effort make obtain outcome information randomize patient ITT analysis . In medication condition , TOP administer maximum 150 mg/day two divided dos . TOP purchase commercially formulate opaque capsule Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) University Pennsylvania School Medicine , purchase TOP commercially formulate medication capsule . Placebo formulate match active medication , inspection capsule permit two differentiate . F. Assessments : Laboratory/Medical Assessments : These assessment include screen patient medical exclusion criterion , assess potential adverse effect medication , corroborate self-reported drinking . Prior entrance study , patient receive : - A physical examination - Urinalysis urine toxicology - Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) - Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase Levels ( GGTP ) - A chemistry panel ( include electrolyte , liver enzymes , bilirubin , uric acid ) - Pregnancy test woman reproductive age ( conduct screen midpoint trial ) . At midpoint end 11-week treatment phase , GGTP repeat corroborate self-reported alcohol consumption . In addition elicit self-reported adverse event , weight vital sign ( blood pressure pulse ) obtain treatment visit . Psychological/Behavioral Assessments : - Sociodemographic information alcohol dependence family history obtain baseline . - Locator information : At baseline , research assistant obtain information patient locator nominate patient , help maintain patient treatment enhance follow-up data collection . - Psychiatric diagnosis : The Structured Clinical Interview ( SCID-I/P ; First et al . 2001 ) Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV ( DSM-IV ) use baseline classify patient accord presence absence standard psychiatric disorder accord DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association 1994 ) . - Alcohol use pattern medication adherence : The Timeline Followback ( TLFB ; Sobell Sobell 1992 ) use estimate current medication adherence alcohol consumption drink intake subsequent study visit . This interview procedure provide quantity/frequency alcohol consumption data period prior interview since last interview . - Cogstate computerize battery : To examine cognitive effect change drink behavior TOP treatment , administer 20-minute battery biweekly . We use task : Detection Task , Identification Task , One Card Learning Task , One Back Memory Task , Shopping List Task , Groton Maze Learning Test . - Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ) ( Decision Making Impulsivity ) [ 15 minute ] : The IGT ( Bechara et al . 1994 ) computerize gamble task intend simulate real-world decision making . Prior research indicate sensitive cognitive impairment HIV population ( Martin et al . 2004 ) well substance user . Because practice effect possible , IGT administer baseline , midpoint ( Visit 6 ) , endpoint ( Visit 9 ) . - Depressive symptom : Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) - Medication adverse effect : Patients provide subjective report adverse effect study visit use list adverse medication effect derive complete study TOP AD . - Adherence antiretroviral medication : We use Timeline Followback method determine percentage ART dose take day prescribe . - Checklist Cognitive Complaints : Individuals rate perceive impairment everyday function domains attention , memory , decision making . - General intellectual function : The Wechsler Test Adult Reading ( WTAR ; Pearson Education , Inc. ) - Dementia screening : The Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE )</detailed_description>
