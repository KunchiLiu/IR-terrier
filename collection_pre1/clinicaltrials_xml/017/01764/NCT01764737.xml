	<detailed_description>VX15/2503-N-101 single ascend dose-escalation , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety tolerability IV-administered VX15/2503 patient multiple sclerosis . This accomplish use dose escalation procedure start low dose VX15/2503 continue base predefined parameter maximum tolerate dose identify . Patients randomize 4:1 ratio receive VX15/2503 placebo . The patient study team blind treatment patient receives . The study drug , VX15/2503 , humanize monoclonal antibody bind semaphorin 4D ( SEMA4D ; CD100 ) antigen . Experimental evidence suggest antibody neutralization SEMA4D may represent new therapeutic strategy treat multiple sclerosis .</detailed_description>
