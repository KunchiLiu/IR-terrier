	<brief_summary>Adenoma ampulla Vater rare represent large proportion benign tumor occur small intestine . The symptom usually non specific due pancreaticobiliary obstruction . The diagnosis also make asymptomatic patient upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . Finally , adenoma discover screening procedure patient Familial Adenomatous Polyposis ( FAP ) . It demonstrate ampullary adenoma malignant potential mimicking `` adenoma-adenocarcinoma '' sequence already describe colon . So , complete removal mandatory . The exception represent subnormal ampulla low grade dysplasia ( LGD ) adenoma discover screen follow-up FAP patient . In case situation stable several year lead simple , annual biannual surveillance . Historically , treatment surgical , associate high mortality morbidity rate pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) high recurrence rate transduodenal resection ( 26 43 % ) . Endoscopic papillectomy ( EP ) represent alternative patient benign least non-invasive ampullary tumor . Unlike thermal ablative method laser photoablation argon plasma destruction , EP allow adequate histologic evaluation especially case en-bloc resection . This technique increasingly use last decade promise result . Nevertheless long-term result mainly report retrospective monocentric series . We intend evaluate , first large multicenter prospective study , long-term result endoscopic papillectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Papillectomy Early Ampullary Tumors : Long-term Results First Large Multicenter Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient select duodenoscopy , biopsy endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) . Adenoma least low grade dysplasia ( LGD ) require inclusion . Two criterion need asymptomatic patient LGD : - ampullary size &gt; 1 cm endoscopy case FAP ; - two series positive biopsy case sporadic tumor . EUS stag estimate follow : uT1 = tumor without invasion muscularis propria ( MP ) duodenum ; uT2 = invasion MP without invasion pancreas ; uT3 = invasion pancreas ; uN- = suspicious lymph node ; uN+ suspicious lymph node . Finally , intraductal pancreatic and/or common bile duct ( CBD ) growth estimate . Only uT1N- tumor without intraductal growth include . Exclusion criterion : - previously treat ampulloma ; - metastatic disease CT-scan ; - advanced tumor duodenoscopy ( ulceration induration involve duodenal roof papilla ) ; - advanced tumor ( &gt; uT1 and/or N+ ) and/or intraductal invasion EUS - absence adenoma resect specimen . Intraductal ultrasonography ( IDUS ) optional . IDUS stag consider follow : uTm = tumor without invasion duodenal submucosa ; uTsm = tumor invasion duodenal submucosa . Investigators 11 experienced endoscopists ( 10 center ) specialize pancreaticobiliary disease select follow : least 4 year endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) practice least six EP last 3 year . The procedure standardize : submucosal injection saline solution reserve duodenal extension around ampulla ; standard polypectomy snare use endocut current ; resection perform one fragment , piece-meal technique accept lesion large 2 cm . The size lesion estimate comparison open snare . The ampullary tumor snare base constant tension apply snare loop electrocautery lesion section . The endoscopist mention procedure consider complete . When need , hemostasis perform injection dilute adrenalin ( 1:10 000 ) and/or hemoclips . Realization additional procedure ( stone removal , biliary pancreatic sphincterotomy , biliary pancreatic stent placementâ€¦ ) leave endoscopist decision record . Patients hospitalize least 2 day procedure . During first 24 hour , fast proton pomp inhibitor ( PPI ) ( +/- antibiotic ) administration recommend . Feeding accept day 2 absence complication final discharge day 3 . Complications occur discharge record report health care provider patient subsequent FU session . We document complication grade severity accord Consensus Criteria . Treatment complication record . Finally , length hospital stay morbidity rate calculate . Size , number fragment , final staging state . In case duodenal submucosal invasion complementary surgery discuss . In case absence tumor resect specimen , experienced pathologist ( JYS ) perform second reading initial biopsy . A first endoscopic control perform 4 8 week retrieval eventual stent systematic biopsy . In case evident persistence tumoral tissue complementary resection do , possible , new endoscopic control 4 week later . Follow-up ( F-U ) perform 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 36 month , include clinical examination , duodenoscopy biopsy EUS +/- ERCP . Therapeutic success conclude case : 1 ) R0 resection = absence invasion duodenal submucosa resect specimen complete excision lesion ( residual tumoral tissue first endoscopic control biopsy , second control case iterative resection ) 2 ) recurrence long-term F-U . Therapeutic failure define : - early failure case duodenal submucosal invasion resect specimen and/or positive biopsy without possibility complementary resection first control ( second control case iterative resection ) ; - late failure case positive biopsy ( persistence recurrence ) FU .</detailed_description>
