	<detailed_description>Objective Some rare complication report patient ileal pouch-anal anastomosis ( IPAA ) colectomy chronic ulcerative colitis dysplasia carcinoma . The suppose pathway ileal pouch mucosa go adaptational change progress phase chronic pouchitis , dysplasia subsequently adenocarcinoma . The purpose study study development dysplasia ileal mucosa among patient Ulcerative Colitis previous hade risk factor develop cellular changes/dysplasia , i.e . previous dysplasia and/or carcinoma specimen . Methods In cohort 680 patient IPAA median follow-up time 18 year , 75 patient risk factor dysplasia identify . Sixty-five patient eligible inclusion , fifty-six patient accept participate study . Patients invited clinical examination , endoscopy macroscopic evaluation well mucosal biopsy . The biopsy review evaluate two independent pathologist , experience colonic pathology , concern morphological change , dysplasia potential carcinoma Results Architectural structural change , inflammation reactive atypia note rectal cuff ileal pouch . So far , none biopsy show genuine dysplasia follow 18 year ( Range 12-23 year ) . In respect full agreement two pathologist . Further microscopic evaluation plan rest participate patient .</detailed_description>
