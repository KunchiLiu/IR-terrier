	<brief_summary>Surgical wound infection remain serious problem despite aseptic technique use prophylactic systemic antibiotic . Such infection occur rate ~20 % high-risk patient receive long segment instrument spinal fusion deformity correction present potentially catastrophic consequence . Given , high cost treatment , payer system unable support expense , investigator must make every effort find new cost-effective way prevent complication . Increasingly surgeon seek address problem place lyophilize Vancomycin spinal surgery wound immediately prior wound closure . This method , know `` intrasite '' application , adapt technique use prevent infection joint replacement surgery . The motivation practice maximize antibiotic concentration within wound minimize systemic concentration toxicity , ( inverse situation use IV antibiotic ) . While popularity intrasite delivery grown rapidly , occur without prospective scientific evidence . Recently , three retrospective paper include nearly 2,500 treated patient , indicate intrasite Vancomycin reduces wind infection without increase adverse event [ 1-3 ] . However , publish data dose pharmacokinetics intrasite Vancomycin , let alone prospective trial efficacy safety . The investigator propose perform first prospective trial intrasite Vancomycin pharmacokinetics safety . Study objectives include standardize application dosing , define peak/trough concentration clearance parameter , verify bactericidal potency , dose selection use future study . This accomplished enrol group patient ( n=10 ) receive one three dose intrasite lyophilize Vancomycin ( 3 , 6 12 mg/cm2 ) , prior wound closure . Vancomycin concentration venous blood wound seroma fluid measure regular interval surgery establish pharmacokinetic parameter . Preliminary data regard local systemic adverse event include wound healing , fusion rate , toxicity prospectively collect . The ultimate goal learning-phase study gather sufficient information regard application , dose , pharmacokinetics , measurement strategy , adverse event prepare Phase III efficacy trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite extremely close attention aseptic technique use prophylactic IV antibiotic , wound infection rate posterior instrument spinal surgery high ~20 % publish study [ 4-13 ] . Such infection devastate patient , frequently require multiple re-operations remove replace spinal implant , lengthy hospital stay , prolonged course intravenous antibiotic , pain , immobility , increase risk complication . While cost initial surgical episode upwards $ 250,000 , total cost care increase quadruple number complication like wound infection occur [ 14 , 15 ] . Given impetus decrease healthcare cost federal reimbursement policy deny payment care surround wound infection , critical search cost-effective way prevent surgical wound infection [ 14 , 16 ] . For several decade standard care North America surgical wound infection prophylaxis IV cephalosporin administration within one hour incision , follow interval IV dose 24 48hrs post-procedure [ 5 , 13 ] . In setting antibiotic effectively treat less half identify infection-causing organism [ 17 , 18 ] . In response , group surgeon , include investigator ' institution , begin place lyophilize Vancomycin surgical wound bed conclusion procedure effort reduce wound infection rate [ 1-3 ] . The rationale behind intrasite antibiotic application increase local concentration antibiotic many time minimally inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) even moderately-resistant gram-positive organism , thereby increase bacterial kill rate [ 3 ] . It also think local antibiotic application minimize blood concentration drug , thereby minimize systemic complication like renal toxicity . Additionally , hypothesize intrasite antibiotic therapy could less inclined generate resistant organism due steep concentration gradient wound systemic circulation . The site potential infection ( wound ) receive dose antibiotic vastly exceed saturation concentration bactericidal effect systemic concentration remain extremely low . Bacteria therefore completely exterminated area wound elsewhere expose minimal concentration Vancomycin selection resistant organism avoid . While none hypotheses rigorously prospectively test , three retrospective study recently publish total 2,479 spinal fusion patient treat intrasite Vancomycin wound infection prophylaxis [ 1-3 ] . The large study demonstrate 0.99 % infection rate treatment group , among low rate ever publish [ 1 ] . Two study show large statistically significant decrease wound infection rate , compare historical control , use intrasite Vancomycin addition standard care IV cephalosporins . Preliminary evidence one study also indicate high level Vancomycin within wound low undetectable level within blood follow surgery [ 3 ] . All study specifically cite adverse event observe related treatment [ 1-3 ] . If intrasite Vancomycin prove safe effective prevent spinal fusion surgical site infection , treatment offer great clinical value reduce morbidity also decrease large unsupported cost . A future large prospective efficacy trial would require provide high-level evidence new mode antibiotic therapy order justify wide-spread adoption practice spine surgery . Such data population might also generalizable surgical wound large prompt paradigm shift infection prophylaxis type surgical wound . The propose study address necessary prerequisite large-scale efficacy trial , include basic pharmacokinetic preliminary prospective safety data .</detailed_description>
