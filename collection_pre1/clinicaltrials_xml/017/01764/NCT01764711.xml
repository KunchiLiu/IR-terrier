	<brief_summary>This study determine different chemical level blood low salt diet . This study compare normal volunteer Postural Tachycardia Syndrome ( POTS )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Stimulation Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome ( POTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients postural tachycardia syndrome subnormal increment aldosterone upright posture , might reflect blunt adrenal response stimulation upon assume upright posture . In AIM , propose assess adrenal response aldosterone stimulation intravenous adrenocorticotropin hormone . For protocol , subject enrol parent study approach sub-study . Subjects assure require participate study even choose participate parent study . There randomization specific sub-study . The order diet ( low sodium vs. high sodium ) perform part parent study , part sub-study . This sub-study perform LOW dietary salt phase . All subject previously screen evaluated part parent study . No screen perform exclusively study . Women childbearing potential serum pregnancy test part parent study . Pregnant woman allow participate .</detailed_description>
