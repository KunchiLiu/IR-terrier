	<brief_summary>Cerebral cavernous malformation ( CCMs ) cluster abnormal blood vessel brain spine . CCMs bleed cause stroke , seizure , headache . CCMs often cause inherited gene mutation ( alteration ) call CCM1 . There wide range disease severity even among family member disease , though natural history clearly describe particular population . This study examine factor influence disease severity collection blood sample , detail medical history , physical neurological exam , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain medical record . The specific goal study : 1. establish registry/database familial CCM case detail clinical data , 2. perform genetic test participant blood sample identify gene may influence development hemorrhage CCM lesion , 3. determine lesion growth study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study one three project participate Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium ( BVMC ) fund Office Rare Diseases Research , part National Center Advancing Translational Sciences ( NCATS ) , National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NINDS ) . The CCM project cross-sectional longitudinal study familial CCM1 patient . The study currently second 5-year cycle . During first 5 year cycle , CCM project focus recruit CCM1 case common Hispanic mutation ( CHM ) . For second 5-year cycle , expand recruitment include CCM1-CHM case , also CCM1 mutation carrier . We collect clinical , genetic , imaging , treatment , outcome data participant , follow cohort time understand natural history disease . For new study participant , ask : - Give permission study staff access medical record collect clinical information obtain copy MRI scan report - Fill questionnaire quality life , family history , medical/surgical history - Give blood sample and/or saliva sample - Give permission store use CCM resect tissue research ( undergoing surgery ) - Participate annual follow-ups update medical , surgical , neurological information</detailed_description>
