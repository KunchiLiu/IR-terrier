	<brief_summary>Main objective : observationally assess efficacy different antimicrobial Bloodstream Infection ( BSI ) due Enterobacteriaceae produce ESBLs carbapenemases . Specific objective : Bacteraemic infection due ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae : - To demonstrate β-lactam/β-lactam inhibitor associate bad cure rate mortality carbapenems control confounders , empirical definitive therapy . - To demonstrate fluoroquinolones definitive therapy associate bad cure rate mortality carbapenems control confounders . - To demonstrate empirical cephalosporin monotherapy associate bad cure rate mortality carbapenems control confounders infection others urinary tract infection . - To demonstrate association active aminoglycosides cephalosporin fluoroquinolines associate bad cure rate mortality carbapenems control confounders . - To demonstrate combination empirical definitive therapy associate well cure rate monotherapy control confounders . - For tigecycline , colistin , fosfomycin , hypothesis . The objective provide adjust estimation association outcome variable comparison carbapenem monotherapy accord clinical situation infection . Bacteraemic infection due carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae : - To demonstrate combination therapy associate bad cure rate mortality monotherapy control confounders . - To show carbapenems associate bad cure rate mortality use infection urinary tract cause isolates show MIC &lt; 2 µg/mL imipenem meropenem comparison cause isolates higher MIC , control confounders . - To show colistin use dose &gt; 6 million IU per day associate improved outcome comparison low dose , control confounders .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODS Study design : multicentre , international retrospective cohort study . Sites : multiple expert investigator different country invite . Conditions fulfil participate include availability database require data ability retrospectively collect data timely manner . Procedure The participant centre ask include : - Previously publish case : case include possible . The fact case previously publish specified database . - Additionally , participant ask include consecutive episode detect review database ( clinical , infection control microbiological record ) January 2004 June 2012 , accord follow criterion : - For ESBL producer : A minimum 20 maximum 50 case include centre ( recent one select ) . - Cases enzyme characterise least group level polymerase chain reaction , PCR , ( , CTX-M , SHV , TEM ) prioritise despite date diagnosis . - If enough number case PCR-characterized enzyme available , PCR-characterisation perform , total number case complete include case ESBL-production identify use standard phenotypic method . - For carbapenemase-producers : case carbapenemase characterise PCR include . All episodes limit 50 case per centre may include . Overall , avoid selection bias , consecutive case accord previous criterion include . Variables A common online database design . Individual access database provide . Main outcome variable : Cure rate day 14 Secondary outcome variable : Mortality 72 hour , 7 , 14 30 day , clinical improvement 72 hour , clinical cure day 28 . Explanatory variable : - Demographics - Severity chronic underlying condition : McCabe Charlson index - Acute severity underlie disease : Pitt score day BSI . - Type acquisition - Source BSI - Severity SIRS presentation - Microorganism , betalactamase , MICs - Empirical therapy - Definitive therapy Quality data . Data approve sign responsible investigator center . All data centrally review ; query send lack data show inconsistency discrepancy . Data analyse per center ; data show significant difference average requested review . Statistical Analysis Plan - Subcohorts patient treat treatment compare select . - A propensity score receive 2 treatment type compare calculate obtain non-parsimonious multivariate model logistic regression outcome variable treatment type . The explanatory variable include age , gender , center , type ward , acquisition , Charlson index , Pitt score , severity SIRS source . - After univariate analysis , multivariate analysis investigate adjust association treatment type main secondary outcome variable perform use logistic regression ( clinical response day 14 ) Cox regression mortality . If time death unavailable , logistic regression use 30-day mortality . Logistic regression also use 72-hour 30-day clinical response . The propensity score added case ; also , Charlson score , Pitt score , severity SIRS source add . Finally , interaction treatment type source classify urinary tract others include .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Episode clinicallysignificant monomicrobial BSI due ESBL carbapenemaseproducing Enterobacteriaceae , include community nosocomial one . For ESBLproducers , detection standard phenotypic method recommend CLSI enough ( although PCRbased characterisation prefer , see ) . For carbapenemaseproducers , characterisation least PCR necessary ( isolates carbapenemase production suspect base antimicrobial susceptibility profile plus phenotypic test alone acceptable , see ) . Subsequent episodes patient cause microorganism may include interval &gt; 3 month . No age limit . Polymicrobial nonclinically significant episode . Episodes potential contaminant ( e.g. , coagulasenegative staphylococci ) isolate one set blood culture typical source infection kind organism ( e.g . catheterrelated ) may include . Unavailability key data ( case count analyse potential selection bias ) Episode occur January 2004 .</criteria>
