	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn carfilzomib help control kidney cancer . The safety drug also study . Carfilzomib design block cancer cell repair . If cancer cell repair , may cause die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Refractory Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive carfilzomib 2 day week first 3 week 4-week study cycle ( Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 cycle ) . Each dose give vein 30 minute . Before receive study drug , give dexamethasone help decrease risk side effect first cycle . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . During Cycle 1 , receive extra fluid ( saline ) vein dose study drug . This part standard clinical care . This also do Cycle 2 , study doctor think need . You remain clinic extra hour receive dose Cycle 1 first dose Cycle 2 , receive additional fluid vein . If side effect drug , tell study doctor right away . The study doctor may lower dose keep dose level . Each study cycle 4 week . Study Visits : Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 cycle : - Your vital sign weight measure . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test Every 4 week ( +/-4 day ) : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug treatment may receive side effect . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test check blood sugar level pancreatic function , study doctor think need . You ask fast ( eat , drink water ) least 8 hour blood draw . Every 8 week ( +/-7 day ) : - You x-ray chest , CT scan chest abdomen , MRI scan brain check status disease . If doctor think need , also bone scan . - If become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , able follow study direction . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug treatment may receive side effect . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine blood sugar test . - You x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan check status disease . Long-Term Follow-up : After stop taking study drug , study staff check health status every 6 month rest life . The study staff collect information either check medical record , email , call telephone . Each call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Carfilzomib FDA approve commercially available treatment multiple myeloma . The use carfilzomib kidney cancer investigational . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
