	<brief_summary>Our goal advance palliative care person live AIDS ( PLWA ) life-limiting co-morbidities decrease suffer increase quality life ( QOL ) . Left without advance care planning ( ACP ) end-of-life decision , miscommunication disagreement may result family charge neglect court battle treatment choice , unmet care delivery unnecessary unwanted care , non-relative caregiver dismiss ( e.g . gay partner ) . We hope increase family ' understanding family member 's wish end-of-life care decrease conflict FAmily-CEntered Advance ( FACE ) Care Planning intervention . We also study communication , quality life , spiritual struggle . Families randomize either Control ( N=96 family ) FACE Intervention ( n=192 dyad ) . FACE family meet trained/certified researcher two 60-minute session schedule one week apart : Session 1 : The Respecting Choices Interview® ; Session 2 : Completion The Five Wishes© . Control family also meet researcher two 60-minute session schedule one week apart : Session 1 : Developmental History ; Session 2 : Nutrition Exercise . Questionnaires administer five time , Baseline 3 , 6 , 12 18 month post-intervention , average 2 year . AIM 1 . To determine efficacy FACE congruence treatment preference PLWA surrogates time , effect pattern congruence development trajectory healthcare utilization ( i.e. , distal outcome : number hospitalization , dialysis , ER visit ) . Hypothesis A : Development congruence may homogeneous FACE may influence pattern congruence development . Hypothesis B : Different pattern congruence development may different effect health care utilization . Hypothesis C : Compared Controls , FACE participant well maintain congruence time . AIM 2 . To determine efficacy FACE key component QOL PLWA . Hypothesis : FACE participant increase good maintain psychosocial QOL compare Controls . AIM 3 . To minimize health disparity ACP Blacks non Blacks identify factor associate disparity . Hypothesis : Blacks FACE intervention complete advance directive rate comparable non Blacks , significantly great rate compare Controls .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our goal advance palliative care person live AIDS ( PLWA ) life-limiting co-morbidities aim relieve suffer maximize quality life . One objective identify variable influence decision-making respect advance care planning ( ACP ) PLWA , well determine unique person-centered need subgroup PLWA , unknown . The negative consequence ACP poor ACP include : unmet care delivery unnecessary unwanted care , conflict erupt ICU , importance non-relative caregiver dismiss , example gay partner . A second objective identify `` best approach '' standard care ACP , key component palliative care , end life support . This approach may minimize health disparity likelihood identify surrogate decision-maker use advance directive . We propose build evidence base , theoretical model , FAmily-CEntered ( FACE ) Advance Care Planning intervention , HIV specific ACP program Black teens gain acceptance demonstrated efficacy increase congruence treatment preference universal complete advance directive surrogate decision-maker . Given demonstrate need benefit ACP low utilization among adult Black PLWA , propose meeting need build FACE model adult live advanced AIDS and/or life-limiting co-morbidities Washington , District Columbia ( DC ) city endemic HIV significant health disparity death rate race adequately-powered , randomize , clinical , 2-arm , single-blinded , controlled trial . We test efficacy FACE intervention increase congruence end-of-life treatment preference PLWA surrogate decision-maker , determine increase congruence maintain time . We also determine FACE acceptable primarily Black inner city adult PLWA . We recruit four hospital-based clinic randomize 288 patient/surrogate dyad ( N=576 subject ) 2:1 ratio either FACE Intervention ( N=192 dyads ) Control ( N=96 dyads ) . Participants HIV dementia , suicidality , homicidality psychosis exclude . Two 60-minuted session conduct trained/certified facilitator weekly interval : FACE Session 1 : The Respecting Choices Interview ( R ) ; Session 2 : Completion The Five Wishes ( c ) . Control also administer dyadic format : Session 1 : Developmental History ; Session 2 : Nutrition Exercise . Standardized self-report measure administer baseline , 3 month post-intervention 6 month post-intervention , 12 month post-intervention , 18 month post-intervention . Thus , participant follow average 2 year . This first study test ACP model , integrate person-centered ( GMM ) variable-centered analysis ( GEE ) ass study outcome .</detailed_description>
