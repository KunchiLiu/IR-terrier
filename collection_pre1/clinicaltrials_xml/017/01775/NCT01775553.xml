	<brief_title>Study High Dose Carfilzomib Multiple Myeloma Patients Who Have Progressed On Standard Dose Carfilzomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single center , phase II study high dose carfilzomib . Patients relapse relapsed/refractory myeloma progression disease standard dosing ( 20/27 mg/m2 ) schedule carfilzomib initially treat dose level 1 , carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2 . During Cycle 1 , patient receive either 20 mg/m2 day 1,2 ( subject receive carfilzomib part another clinical trial within last 4 week ) 56 mg/m2 ( subject enrol present study progression disease carfilzomib within last month - example subject enrol CMAP compassionate use carfilzomib ) . Thereafter , subject receive 56 mg/m2 remain dos give Cycle 1 Day 8 onwards . If minimal response well achieve ( therefore disease response recapture ) bone marrow biopsy repeat . If 56 mg/m2 tolerate , dose carfilzomib reduce dose level -1 i.e . 45 mg/m2 . If subject tolerate 45 mg/m2 dose would reduce dose level -2 i.e . 36 mg/m2 . If subject tolerate 36 mg/m2 , subject would come study . Dexamethasone 8 mg po/IV administer prior carfilzomib dos . Once patient develops disease progression study , patient may return receive maximum tolerate dose carfilzomib patient addition therapeutic dose dexamethasone ( total 20-40 mg weekly ) . An IMId ( e.g . thalidomide lenalidomide ) and/or alkylator also add carfilzomib 27 36 mg/m2 per investigator discretion either concurrent addition dexamethasone subsequent disease progression carfilzomib concurrent therapeutic dexamethasone .</detailed_description>
