	<brief_summary>Septic shock remain dominant cause death ICU 's developed world approximately 400,000 case annually US another 20,000 annually Canada . While many retrospective prospective review septic shock patient undertaken worldwide , many key question remain unanswered . These question include true incidence , associate morbidity mortality septic shock North America , key factor associate successful management marker suggest high probability complicate clinical course . Part reason persistence question , fact previous ongoing review septic shock severe sepsis either limited number ( typically &lt; 150 ) bias need eligible specific clinical trial ( typically , non-eligible patient follow data collect . We propose examine specific question within temporally comprehensive cohort septic shock patient review individual chart use define data-extraction template .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives - Determination impact rapidity implementation antibiotic therapy , source control ( require ) fluid resuscitation mortality septic shock - Utility persistence increase vasopressor need 1st 24 hour shock predictor complicate ICU course ( ICU duration &gt; 1 week ) death - Assessment initial biochemical parameter , co-morbidities new onset organ failure admission predictor complicate ICU course ( ICU duration &gt; 1 week ) death Data Collection : Data collection would perform combination study nurse 2nd 3rd year medical student hire summer research project . Research nurse student train principal investigator . A minimum 10 % chart randomly audit principal investigator ensure appropriate data extraction . This allow PI review correct discrepant coding issue judge specific question ( e.g . appropriateness antibiotics/presence effective antibiotic ) . Data Collection Tool : Attached . In addition , data ICU registry include basic epidemiologic data ( age , sex , pertinent medical/surgical comorbidities/risk factor , etc ) well Apache II</detailed_description>
