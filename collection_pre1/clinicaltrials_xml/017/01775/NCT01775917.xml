	<brief_summary>During recent decade need surgical evacuation uterus early miscarriage incomplete miscarriage question . It show observational approach , many case , good invasive one without increase incidence uterine infection . show misoprostol - prostaglandin E1 give miss abortion successful empty uterus 85 % case without need surgical intervention . recent year many woman prefer approach surgical one . Many try use sonographic sign endometrial thickness , presence gestational sac , color doppler differ blood clot gestational residuum uterus , decide accord sign wether need surgical evacuation expectant management could use . none method proven completely efficient predictor . In study investigator examine whether doppler index uterine artery help predict gestational residuum need surgical evacuation uterus could manage expectantly . The study hypothesis resistance uterine artery doppler low case intrauterine residuum oppose high resistance case without residuum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It 's prospective observational study take place gynecology department Carmel medical center Haifa , Israel . The study population woman diagnosis miss abortion match 8 week pregnancy less , incomplete abortion anembryonic pregnancy treat misoprostol gynecologic emergency room accord department 's protocol . department 's protocol treatment miss abortion match 8 week pregnancy less , anembryonic pregnancy incomplete abortion . woman usually get full explanation doctor emergency room possible treatment : 1. surgical evacuation i.e . dilatation curettage 2. treatment misoprostol 800 mcg give vaginally . treatment use routinely emergency room . If woman choose treatment misoprostol also tell study agrees participate study sign inform consent form . After get first dose misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally woman usually discharge home sonographic follow do several preset occasion ultrasound do vaginally sonographic index examine : presence gestational sac gestational residuum size , color doppler residuum , size uterus ... addition index routinely examine follow accord department protocol examine study index uterine artery doppler ( i.e . S/D ratio , resistance index , pulsatility index ) . accord department protocol day 3 first day follow , gestational sac still see uterus , endometrial thickness 30 mm , second dose misoprostol give , woman reexamine day 10 , surgical evacuation perform still finding ( gestational sac endometrium &gt; 30mm ) otherwise woman discharge last follow day 4-5 next menstruation , 's decided abortion complete uterus completely empty . gestational residuum find menstruation woman go surgical evacuation . In end compare uterine artery doppler index woman complete abortion fail misoprostol treatment need surgical evacuation . No change treatment do study base uterine artery doppler index , 's observational study .</detailed_description>
