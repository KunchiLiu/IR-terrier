	<detailed_description>This ancillary study E-Mechanic , National Institutes Health study 198 individual objective understand certain people fail lose weight exercise program . In E-Mechanic change body weight , body composition , energy intake energy expenditure measure 3 different exercise program 24 week duration . The 3 exercise program compare self-directed exercise , low dose exercise high dose exercise . The goal ancillary study undertake comprehensive assessment energy metabolism metabolic chamber group 60 obese individual enrol main study . We compare difference change 24h energy expenditure spontaneous physical activity 3 exercise program . We also test change energy metabolism might explain people n't lose expected amount weight 24 week exercise .</detailed_description>
