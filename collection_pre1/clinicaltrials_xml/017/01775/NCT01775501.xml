	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational combination drug learn whether drug combination work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean modify FOLFOX sorafenib combination still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , combination effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA yet approve modified FOLFOX sorafenib combination use study liver cancer . FOLFOX combination three drug : folinic acid ( leucovorin ) , fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , oxaliplatin . The dosage amount FDA approve drug modify slightly study . The FOLFOX combination approve FDA standard treatment colorectal cancer . However , approve treatment liver cancer . Sorafenib new drug , approve brand name Nexavar treatment liver cancer . It also currently test various cancer . Sorafenib work slow and/or stop development new cancer cell new blood vessel . By slow and/or stop growth new blood vessel around tumor , believe sorafenib prevents slow growth tumor . In research study , sorafenib , standard treatment , combine modify FOLFOX , show antitumor activity liver cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After agree participate study , patient ask undergo screening test procedure find he/she eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn patient take part research study . If patient test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , physical exam , performance status , electrocardiogram , assessment tumor , blood test , urine test , pregnancy test optional research biopsy . If test show patient eligible participate research study , he/she begin study treatment . If patient meet eligibility criterion , he/she able participate . If patient take part research study , he/she give sorafenib study drug-dosing diary treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) , time patient take study drug twice daily . The diary also include special instruction sorafenib . There 2-week Lead-in period , patient receive sorafenib alone first two week study . Cycle 1 begin patient receive combination sorafenib FOLFOX . For FOLFOX , three chemotherapy drug injected central vein patient 's chest ( portacath ) give every two week ( 14 day ) , start Day 15 Cycle 1 . The patient receive oxaliplatin first 2-hour infusion , follow leucovorin , 5-FU . The 5-FU infusion last 46 hour give small portable pump . The investigator ask patient come back clinic day 3 ( 46 hour begin 5-FU dose ) pump discontinuance . During cycle patient physical exam patient ask question his/her general health specific question problem he/she might medication he/she may take . As part research study patient undergo research blood test measure certain protein blood learn affect study treatment may disease . About 1 teaspoon blood drawn Days 3 14 first two week sorafenib alone , Days 14 28 post-treatment FOLFOX-sorafenib , available , time progression ( patient 's disease get bad ) . The patient 's blood pressure monitor every week first 6 week study ( week sorafenib lead-in period Cycle 1 ) . The investigator asses patient 's tumor chest , abdominal pelvic CT MRI scan every 8 week throughout study . After final dose study drug investigator ask patient come back clinic repeat follow procedure : medical review , physical examination , blood test , pregnancy test tumor assessment CT MRI . The investigator would like keep track patient 's medical condition rest his/her life . The investigator would like call patient telephone year see patient . Keeping touch patient check his/her condition every year help investigator look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
