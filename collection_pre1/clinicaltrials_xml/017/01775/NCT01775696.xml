	<detailed_description>Introduction : Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) characterize abnormal β-amyloid deposition associate Tau-based neurofibrillary tangle . The metabolism proteins modulate individual physiological background . In addition genetic factor , early brain inflammation presence spontaneous beta amyloid ( Aβ ) -specific immune response likely important influence amyloid pathogenesis , demonstrate recent neuropathological experimental study . In vivo measurement β-amyloid load brain inflammation become available development new tracer positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . So far , tracer brain inflammation limit ability detect change expression peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) , mainly present surface activate microglial cell . The recently develop [ 18F ] DPA-714 find good ligand PBR previous tracer . Inflammatory immune anti-Aβ response ( I2ARs ) likely occur early pathogenic protein cascade . They could thus constitute early marker AD diagnosis also play key role phenotypic presentation prognostic . Comparing sporadic AD familial form AD cause APP , PSEN1 PSEN2 mutation ( symptomatic at-risk non-symptomatic relative ) aid establish chronology pathological event define clinical impact . The main objective study investigate central peripheral inflammatory , well spontaneous Aβ-specific , immune response asymptomatic stage early stage AD combine molecular image technique blood biomarker analyse . The early preclinical stage AD study relative patient PSEN1 , PSEN2 APP mutation at-risk ( 50 % ) mutation carrier . The secondary objective 1. investigate specificity central inflammatory response ( DPA PET scan ) peripheral I2AR ( blood marker ) analyze correlation amyloid-binding radiotracer ( PIB PET scan ) ; 2. evaluate prognostic value central peripheral I2ARs disease evolution 2 year follow-up ; 3. compare central peripheral I2ARs sporadic genetic case AD ; 4. correlate initial amyloid load disease evolution sporadic genetic case AD 5. correlate I2AR biomarkers CSF biomarkers ( Aβ1-42 , tau phosphorylated tau ) consent lumbar puncture obtain ( optional ) . Each patient invite participate long-term follow-up study inform possibility brain donation research purpose . A library blood sample also collect stored Platform Biological Resources Salpetriere Hospital , allow future collaboration new diagnostic prognostic biomarkers base novel technique . Methodology : We propose conduct multimodal study , first transversal , longitudinal two year follow-up , base 1. molecular PET image couple [ 18F ] DPA-714 , marker central inflammation , PIB , marker amyloid deposition ; 2. peripheral I2AR analysis ( blood marker ) ; 3. analysis genetic factor ; 4. measurement regional cortical atrophy MRI . A group patient early stage AD ( CDR = 0.5 ) , define new diagnostic criterion ( Dubois et al , 2007 ) , compare group moderate AD patient define criterion NINCDS AIREN ( CDR = 1 2 ) , group patient another type dementia ( frontotemporal dementia ) control group . Recruitment sporadic AD patient control occur Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital . Teams geneticists Paris Rouen recruit patient know mutation at-risk asymptomatic first-degree relative . Every subject undergo follow examination : ( ) Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital , clinical neuropsychological assessment , 3T multimodal research MRI , blood draw 8 study panel plasmatic marker , measure blood level anti-Aβ antibody , evaluate Aβ-specific T lymphocyte response study potential genetic modifier ; ( b ) ORSAY Hospital , two PET scan perform day : first [ 11C ] -PIB PET scan , follow 3 hour later [ 18F ] DPA-714 imaging . Clinical follow-up conduct annually two year include MRI blood draw last visit . The previous study BIOMAGE , fund French National Research Agency ( ANR 2007 ) , demonstrate logistical feasibility project well efficiency patient control recruitment . The subject include BIOMAGE invite participate research project , thus utilize cohort DPA image I2AR marker . The duration research four year . Expected result perspective : This study evaluate contribution I2ARs AD progression . Inclusion sporadic familial form AD aid study chronology pathological event . We expect I2ARs appear early stage disease constitute new prognostic factor . I2ARs could also become therapeutic marker assessment novel anti-amyloid treatment may offer new insight development Aβ-specific immunotherapy strategy .</detailed_description>
