	<brief_summary>Study part 1 2 Assessment Zn absorption regular biofortified wheat : stable isotope absorption study woman childbearing age consume test meal prepare either biofortified Zn wheat , regular wheat post-harvest fortify wheat two different extraction rate . Study part 3 Assessment Zn absorption intrinsically extrinsically label wheat : stable isotope absorption study woman childbearing age , men , consume test meal prepare either intrinsically label Zn biofortified wheat , regular wheat post-harvest fortify wheat extrinsically label immediately consumption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Human Zinc Absorption From Wheat-based Meals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal study part 1 2 evaluate compare fractional absolute Zn absorption biofortified wheat cultivar ( 60 ppm Zn ) regular wheat ( 28 ppm Zn ) post harvest fortify wheat ( 60 ppm Zn ) total 3 test meal per study . The study conduct product base wheat high extraction rate ( study part 1 ) medium extraction rate ( study part 2 ) two separate group woman childbearing age . The goal study part 3 investigate difference absorption measurement intrinsically extrinsically label biofortified wheat . The label test meal nature fortificant ( extrinsic v intrinsic ) , total 3 test meal .</detailed_description>
