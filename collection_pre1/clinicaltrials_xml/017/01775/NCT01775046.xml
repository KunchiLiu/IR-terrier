	<brief_title>Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft With Captivia Delivery System Treatment Descending Thoracic Aortic Diseases ( VALIANT CAPTIVIA France )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data regarding use routine practice thoracic aortic stent graft France expect French National Authority Health ( HAS ) . Therefore , opinion report December 22 , 2009 , HAS make maintenance reimbursement approval stent graft dependent presentation result specific follow-up study carry cohort patient representative French population treat real-life condition use . This prospective cohort study must involve patient implanted registration LPPR ( List Products Services qualify Reimbursement ) . The result follow-up study must forward National Committee Evaluation Medical Devices Health Technologies ( CNEDiMTS ) examination year . The assessment follow-up could lead recommendation CNEDiMTS continue stop reimbursement concerned stent graft . In France , The Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft Captivia Delivery System register LPPR period 3 year since January 12 , 2011 . In order comply HAS expectation , Medtronic Bakken Research Center set long term non-interventional study Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft Captivia Delivery System .</detailed_description>
