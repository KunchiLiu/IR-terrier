	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well intravenous ( IV ) chemotherapy oral chemotherapy work treat patient previously untreated stage III-IV human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone , lomustine , etoposide , procarbazine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare efficacy standard cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone ( CHOP ) oral chemotherapy regimen acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -related ( AR ) -non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) sub-Saharan Africa respect overall survival ( OS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare objective response rate ( ORR ) person randomize CHOP oral chemotherapy . II . To compare progression free survival ( PFS ) person randomize CHOP oral chemotherapy . III . To compare safety tolerance person randomize CHOP oral chemotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe rate completion therapy person randomize CHOP oral chemotherapy . II . To describe adherence chemotherapy person randomize CHOP oral chemotherapy . III . To describe adherence antiretroviral therapy person randomize CHOP oral chemotherapy . IV . To describe effect therapy HIV control , measure cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4 count HIV viral load . V. To investigate correlate survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive CHOP chemotherapy comprise cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive lomustine PO daily ( QD ) day 1 ( course 1 3 ) , etoposide PO QD day 1-3 , cyclophosphamide PO QD day 22-26 , procarbazine hydrochloride PO QD day 22-26 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
