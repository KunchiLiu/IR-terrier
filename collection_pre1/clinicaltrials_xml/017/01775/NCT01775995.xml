	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) one common , costly disable condition . Treatment refractory CLBP include long-term opioid therapy even though often marginally effective . Prescription opioid abuse national epidemic . Development safe , effective non-addictive therapy chronic pain national priority . Mindfulness meditation promising , safe treatment chronic pain , mental health addictive disorder . When combined cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , standard care CLBP , may produce additive benefit . No study evaluate potential combined meditation-CBT intervention improve outcome patient opioid-treated CLBP . This unblinded 26-week pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) test method feasibility efficacy meditation-CBT improve health-related quality life ( primary outcome : pain severity physical function ) reduce opioid medication use ( secondary outcome ) among adults opioid-treated CLBP . Eligible participant adult least 21 year old , daily CLBP treat daily opioids ( least 30 morphine-equivalent mg/day ) least 3 month . They recruit outpatient clinic community setting , randomly assign one two study arm : meditation-CBT + usual care usual care alone . The targeted meditation-CBT intervention consist ) therapist-led group training ( two-hours/week 8 week ) , b ) at-home meditation practice ( least 30 minutes/day , 6 days/week ) . Control participants offer intervention study completion . Outcome measure , collect 0 , 8 ( directly post-intervention ) 26 ( 18 week post-intervention ) week gather data efficacy potential mechanisms action meditation-CBT intervention . This RCT test hypothesis , 26 week , meditation-CBT group participant ( meditation-CBT + usual care ) , compare wait-list control group ( usual care alone ) , improve health-related quality life ( primary outcome : pain severity physical function ) reduce opioid medication use ( secondary outcome ) . In addition , also decrease alcohol drug use/misuse , improve stress-sensitive measure economic outcome . Increased pain acceptance , mindfulness level stress reduction hypothesize mechanistic pathway . This study directly address national priority aim development effective , safe treatment CLBP reduction opioid use . Potential benefit accrue positive finding include improve quality life reduce opioid pain medication use among patient refractory , opioid-treated CLBP .</detailed_description>
