	<brief_title>Off-the-Shelf Splints Versus Occupational Therapy Splints Treatment Trapeziometacarpal Arthrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trapeziometacarpal ( TMC ) arthrosis common , particularly woman , consider normal part age process . Overall radiographic prevalence TMC arthrosis describe high 91 % patient old eighty year age . It increase steadily age 41 year , rapidly woman men . Another study , conduct Netherlands , show population 55 year old , 67 % woman 55 % men radiographic sign arthrosis hand . It also find distal interphalangeal ( DIP ) joint commonly affect ( 47 % ) , follow TMC joint ( 36 % ) . However , report symptomatic arthrosis , TMC arthrosis contributes pain disability arthrosis interphalangeal joint . Psychosocial factor recognize strong determinant highly variable pain intensity arm-specific disability . The pathophysiologic psychosocial difference patient present doctor treatment incompletely understood . A hand-based thumb spica splint interphalangeal ( IP ) joint free specific nonoperative palliative treatment TMC arthrosis . The goal splint wear improve comfort function . The data regard specific splint material limit , suggest shorter flexible splint preferred patient equally effective . Recently , investigator look difference thermoplast neoprene hand-based thumb spica splint treatment TMC arthrosis . The neoprene splint rat comfortable thermoplast splint otherwise difference . To investigator ' knowledge study look added value occupational therapy splint treatment TMC arthrosis . The investigator believe time spend occupational therapist ( OTs ) coach patient adaptive palliative measure valuable addition technical skill investigator draw conclusion investigator research prospective trial . The investigator propose two arm unblinded , randomize ( 1:1 ) control trial evaluate difference prefabricate off-the-shelf splint splint provide OT standard care coaching . The investigator want determine difference arm-specific disability , average pain , satisfaction average 2 month splint provide OT prefabricate off-the-shelf splint .</detailed_description>
