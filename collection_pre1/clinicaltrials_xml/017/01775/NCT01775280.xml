	<brief_summary>The study enroll patient non-resectable borderline resectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , intraheaptic choalngiocarcinoma ( IHCC ) colorectal cancer metastasis . Patients candidate liver transplantation limit extrahepatic disease . All patient treat radioembolization . Primary endpoint percentage patient downstaged resectability . Secondary endpoint radiologic response radioembolization , tissue response radiomembolization systemic immune response intra-tumoral T-cell response radioembolization . - Trial radiotherapy</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patients already consider radioembolization fulfil criterion include study . If radioembolization consider tumor board , inclusion study consider . Nonresectable borderline resectable liver tumor ( HCC , CRCM CCC ) assess multidisciplinary tumorboard . Nonresectability borderline resectablily base closeness essential nonresectable structure ( f.e . portal vein bifurca tion hepatic vein trifurcation ) insufficient liver volume resection , general performance status patient . Chemotherapy ( mostly applicable CRCM ) termininated least 4 week prior enrol patient study . Concomitant manoevers manipulate liver volume like portal vein embolization ligation twostage resection allow Male female patient 1899 year age Presentation case Multidisciplinary Meeting attend hepatobiliary surgeon , oncologist , hepatologists radiologist Written inform consent give patient Adequate liver function kidney function test , include follow . It possible perform endoscopic percutaneous stent placement achieve normalisation laboratory parameter . Women breastfeed use effective contraception sexually active , pregnant agree become pregnant 12 month thereafter . A negative pregnancy test inclusion trial require woman &lt; 50 year . Men agree father child participation trial 12 month thereafter . Effective contraception Patient compliance geographic proximity Exclusion criterion : Patients clinical indication radioembolization ( resectable tumor , need downsize ) contraindication ethical ground , woman pregnant breast feeding , significant concomitant disease state ( e.g. , renal failure , hepatic dysfunction , cardiovascular disease , etc ) base mentioned labaratory value preoperative cardiac assessment make patient unsuitable major surgery know suspected noncompliance , drug alcohol abuse , enrolment clinical trial within last 4 week , extrahepatic tumor burden , evaluate PET/CT chest CT . Potentially resectable small lung nodule hilar lymphadenopathy CT PET case MCRC mandate systemic chemotherapy prior enrolment trial already perform . The patient may enrol trial downstaged radioembolization finish systemic chemotherapy . Anatomic variant arteriogram prevents selective delivery chemotherapy liver ( discuss within group principal investigator ) Life expectancy &lt; 3 month Candidacy liver transplantation case HCC</criteria>
