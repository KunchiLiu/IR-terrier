	<brief_summary>In addition genetic susceptibility , immune system intestinal microbiota , diet hypothesize important factor onset progression Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ( IBD ) . Further insight factor affect disease activity may contribute targeted intervention improve disease burden healthcare cost patient . However , well-designed study explore role diet development exacerbation hardly available . The investigator hypothesize difference dietary pattern affect intestinal microbiota composition thereby contribute development exacerbation IBD . Furthermore , subgroup patient suffers malnutrition , although exact prevalence unknown since simple noninvasive screening tool validate IBD . The investigator hypothesize malnutrition frequently present IBD patient associate dietary intake disease characteristic .</brief_summary>
