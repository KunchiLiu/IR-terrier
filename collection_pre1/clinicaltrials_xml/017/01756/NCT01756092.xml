	<detailed_description>During past decade increase awareness potential free adipose cell graft treat variety problem reconstructive cosmetic plastic surgery . There encouraging report describe use autologous fat graft ( fat tissue harvest standard liposuction technique give patient re-injected another site ) treat breast deformity set benign previously treat malignant breast problem . There correspond large scale laboratory investigation effort potential adipose derived stem cell ( ADSC 's ) harvest liposuction induce differentiate various cell type mesenchymal cell line . The potential clinical utility cell treatment patient present breast deformity segmental mastectomy ( lumpectomy ) radiation therapy describe , study rigorous prospective manner . The investigator believe clinical use autologous fat cell graft unique advantage treatment breast deformity . The technique minimally invasive , easily repeat associate minimal surgical morbidity ( indeed may advantage improve appearance breast deformity area harvest ) , typically display rapid recovery , complication rate great ( probably less ) establish currently use surgical treatment ( ) breast problem , oncologically safe .</detailed_description>
