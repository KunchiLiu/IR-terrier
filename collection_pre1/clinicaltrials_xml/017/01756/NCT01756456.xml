	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess safety efficacy two dose regimen ( 10 µg/ml 20 µg/ml 6 time day ) recombinant human nerve growth factor ( rhNGF ) eye drop solution compare vehicle induce complete healing stage 2 ( persistent epithelial defect ) 3 ( corneal ulcer ) neurotrophic keratitis ( NK ) measure Reading Center evaluate clinical picture corneal fluorescein staining . Secondary objective study assess duration complete healing , improvement visual acuity improvement corneal sensitivity follow treatment rhNGF eye drop solution This combined phase I/II study . The phase I II segment study conduct 8 week , randomize , double-masked , vehicle control , parallel group study ( refer control treatment period ) follow 48 56 week follow-up period The design phase I phase II segment study identical exception phase I segment study randomization scheme different patient follow additional safety assessment blood sample PK ( pharmacokinetic ) profiling In ascend dose Phase I segment study two dos rhNGF 10 20 µg/ml evaluate sequential manner</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 18 year age old . 2 . Patients stage 2 ( persistent epithelial defect , PED ) stage 3 ( corneal ulcer ) neurotrophic keratitis involve one eye . . Patients Controlateral eye affect stage 1 NK enrol . 3 . PED corneal ulceration least 2 week duration refractory one conventional nonsurgical treatment neurotrophic keratitis ( e.g. , preservativefree artificial tear , gel ointment ; discontinuation preserve topical drop medication decrease corneal sensitivity ; therapeutic contact lens ) . 4 . Evidence decrease corneal sensitivity ( ≤ 4 cm use CochetBonnet aesthesiometer ) within area PED corneal ulcer outside area defect least one corneal quadrant . 5 . Best correct distance visual acuity ( BCDVA ) score ≤ 75 ETDRS letter , ( ≥ 0.2 LogMAR , ≤ 20/32 Snellen ≤ 0.625 decimal fraction ) affect eye . 6 . No objective clinical evidence improvement PED corneal ulceration within 2 week prior study enrolment . 7 . Only patient satisfy Informed Consent requirement may include study . The patient and/or his/her legal representative must read , sign date Informed Consent document studyrelated procedure perform . The Informed Consent form sign patient and/or legal representative must approve IEC/IRB current study . 8 . Patients must ability willingness comply study procedure . 9 . Patients must eligible National Health Insurance ( applicable ) . 1 . Patients stage 2 3 NK affect eye . 2 . Any active ocular infection ( bacterial , viral , fungal protozoal ) active ocular inflammation relate NK affect eye . 3 . Any ocular disease require topical ocular treatment affect eye course study treatment period . No topical treatment study medication provide study sponsor allow study protocol administer affected eye course study treatment period . 4 . Patients severe vision loss affect eye potential visual improvement opinion investigator result study treatment . 5 . Schirmer test without anesthesia ≤3 mm/5 minute affect eye . 6 . Patients severe blepharitis and/or severe meibomian gland disease affect eye . 7 . History ocular surgery ( include laser refractive surgical procedure ) affect eye within three month study enrolment . ( An exception precede statement allow ocular surgery consider cause stage 2 3 NK ) . Ocular surgery affect eye allow study treatment period elective ocular surgery procedure plan duration followup period . 8 . Prior surgical procedure ( ) treatment NK ( e.g . complete tarsorraphy , conjunctival flap , etc ) affect eye exception amniotic membrane transplantation . Patients previously treat amniotic membrane transplantation may enrol two week membrane disappear within area PED corneal ulcer least six week date amniotic membrane transplantation procedure . Patients previously treat Botox ( botulinum toxin ) injection use induce pharmacologic blepharoptosis eligible enrolment last injection give least 90 day prior enrolment study . 9 .

Patients punctual occlusion punctual plug insert prior study eligible enrolment provide punctual occlusion maintain study . 11 . Evidence corneal ulceration involve posterior third corneal stroma , corneal melt perforation affect eye . 12 . Presence history ocular systemic disorder condition might hinder efficacy study treatment evaluation , could possibly interfere interpretation study result , could judge investigator incompatible study visit schedule conduct ( e.g . progressive degenerative corneal retinal condition , uveitis , optic neuritis , poorly control diabetes , autoimmune disease , systemic infection , neoplastic disease ) . 13 . Any need anticipate change dose systemic medication know impair function trigeminal nerve ( e.g . neuroleptic , antipsychotic antihistamine drug ) .
