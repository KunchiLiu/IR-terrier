	<brief_summary>Death chronic liver disease double UK last decade . This largely due rise liver disease excess alcohol consumption , obesity relate fatty liver disease hepatitis B &amp; C infection . The current 'liver test ' identify liver injury damage advance stage . They neither estimate degree injury accurately help judge prognosis . The complication chronic liver disease result mainly raise pressure within liver . We currently measure pressure passing long catheter jugular vein neck liver . This invasive test carry small yet significant risk complication available outside specialise liver centre . Raised pressure within liver also associate change microorganism within gut . This lead increase infective complication among patient liver cirrhosis . We aim noninvasively measure pressure within liver use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . We recruit 49 patient chronic liver disease liver pressure measurement part routine clinical assessment . The participant attend Biomedical Research Unit MR Centre single 2hour visit . We also collect blood , urine stool sample . The diagnostic accuracy quantitative MRI technique validate pressure obtain via invasive test . The quantitative MRI technique also correlate biomarkers liver injury obtain blood urine sample . The stool sample obtain used characterise gut microorganism patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 18 year age . 2 . Patients HVPG measurement within last 6 week . 3 . Underlying portal hypertension due chronic liver disease alcoholic liver disease , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , chronic hepatitis B C heamochromatosis . 4 . Patients investigated clinical suspicion portal hypertension , normal portal pressure HVPG measurement . 5 . Ability consent participate study . 1 . Patients underlie disease NOT relate alcohol excess , NAFLD , chronic hepatitis B , C haemochromatosis . 2 . Abdominal/waist circumference great 112 cm ( 44 inch ) due scanner bore constraint 3 . Pregnant woman . 4 . Absolute contraindication MRI . Any patient indicates MR safety questionnaire suspect may metal eye ( ) require xray prior MRI scan confirm eye ( ) free metal . This verify use previous xray record . Any patient whose previous record indicate may metal eye ( ) patient without xray record xrayed purpose study . Any patient current metal eye ( ) , give MRI scan therefore recruit study .</criteria>
