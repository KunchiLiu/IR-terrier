	<brief_summary>Primary objective : - To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) BEZ235 administer twice daily ( BID ) single agent patient relapse refractory acute leukemia - To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) Secondary objective : - Assess safety tolerability daily oral administration BEZ235 BID schedule - To describe preliminary anti-leukemic activity BEZ235 patient acute leukemia - To correlate change pharmacodynamic biomarkers basic pharmacokinetic data Exploratory objective : - To assess pre-treatment phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway-related gene blast cell malignant cell derive blood bone marrow . - To assess pharmacodynamic change component PI3K-protein kinase B ( AKT ) -mTOR pathway bone marrow follow treatment potential predictive biomarkers pharmacodynamic ( PD ) activity BEZ235 association clinical response . - To identify potential resistance mechanism biomarkers may correlate efficacy response blood bone marrow sample pre-and post-treatment case resistance</brief_summary>

Patients Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) / breakpoint cluster region abelson tyrosine protein kinase 1 ( bcrabl ) negative B Tprecursor ALL relapse least induction consolidation chemotherapy refractory disease standard treatment available consider feasible . : 2 . Patients Philadelphia chromosome and/or bcrabl positive Bprecursor ALL CMLBP relapse refractory first secondline therapy include least two abelson tyrosine protein kinase 1 ( ABL kinase ) inhibitor . If point mutation threonine 315 isoleucine ( T315I ) bcrabl mutation identify , prior treatment second TKI require . : 3 . Patients Philadelphia chromosome and/or bcrabl positive Bprecursor ALL prior CMLBP presence minimal residual disease ( MRD ) presence T315I mutation highresistance mutation show unresponsive approve thyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . : 4 . Patients cytopathologically confirm diagnosis AML , either relapse refractory standard therapy , consider inappropriate candidate conventional salvage therapy . : 5 . Patients cytopathologically confirm diagnosis AML previously untreated due age , poor prognosis , concurrent medical condition consider inappropriate candidate standard induction therapy , refuse standard induction therapy B ) Target population : expansion cohort The target population dose expansion include category AML , ALL CMLBP patient dose escalation phase .
