	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , concurrent control study , design confirm efficacy NovoTTF-100A System patient recurrent GBM treat real life setting follow approval comparable BSC chemotherapy patient . The device portable , battery operate device approve treatment adult patient ( 22 year age old ) histologically-confirmed glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , follow histologically- radiologically-confirmed recurrence supra-tentorial region brain receiving chemotherapy . The device intend use monotherapy , intend alternative standard medical therapy GBM surgical radiation option exhaust .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-approval Study NovoTTF-100A Recurrent GBM Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE : The effect electric field generate NovoTTF-100A device ( TTFields , TTF ) test large prospective , randomized trial , 237 recurrent GBM patient . The outcome subject treat NovoTTF-100A device compare treated effective best standard care chemotherapy ( include bevacizumab ) . NovoTTF-100A subject comparable overall survival subject receive best available chemotherapy US today . Similar result show comparability NovoTTF-100A BSC chemotherapy see secondary endpoint . Recurrent GBM patient treat NovoTTF-100A device trial experience few side effect general , significantly few treatment related side effect , significantly low gastrointestinal , hematological infectious adverse event compare control . The device-related adverse event see mild moderate skin irritation beneath device electrode . Finally , quality life measure well NovoTTF-100A subject group compare subject receive effective best standard care chemotherapy . DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL : Patients GBM whose disease first recur despite standard treatment ( Surgery , radiation therapy , Temozolomide treatment ) meet requirement participation study recruit one two group base patient preference alone : 1 . Treatment NovoTTF-100A device , 2 . Treatment best standard care practice participate center . If recruit best standard care group , patient receive chemotherapeutic agent chosen base prior treatment standard care practice treat center . If recruit NovoTTF-100A group , patient treat continuously tumor progression . NovoTTF-100A treatment consist wear four electrically insulate electrode head . Electrode placement require shave scalp treatment . Patients continue treatment home maintain regular daily routine . During trial , regardless whether assign NovoTTF-100A treatment group best standard care group , patient need return every month hospital outpatient clinic examine physician . These routine visit continue long patient 's disease progressing . During visit clinic patient examine physically neurologically , well fill neuro-cognitive questionnaire . Adverse event data collect patients.. After follow plan , patient contact per month telephone answer basic question health status . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : TTFields alternate electric field low intensity . This mean change direction repetitively many time second . Since change direction rapidly ( 200 thousand time second ) , cause muscle twitch , effect electrically activate tissue body ( brain , nerve heart ) . Since intensity TTFields body low , cause heating . The breakthrough finding make NovoCure finely tune alternate field low intensity , term TTFields ( Tumor Treating Fields ) , cause significant slow growth cancer cell . Due unique geometric shape cancer cell multiply , TTFields cause building block cell move pile way cell physically explode . In addition , cancer cell also contain miniature building block act tiny motor move essential part cell place place . TTFields cause tiny motor fall apart since special type electric charge . As result two effect , cancer tumor growth slow even reverse continuous exposure TTFields . Other cell body ( normal healthy tissue ) affect much less cancer cell since multiply much slow rate . In addition TTFields direct certain part body , leave sensitive area reach . In conclusion , TTField hold promise serve brand new cancer treatment side effect promise affectivity slow reverse disease .</detailed_description>
