	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine doxycycline ( 100 mg bid ) inhibit ( least 40 % ) increase great transverse diameter small abdominal aortic aneurysm ( 3.5-5.0 cm men , 3.5-4.5 cm woman ) 24-month period observation comparison placebo-treated control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Treatment Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>N-TA^3CT randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled test hypothesis doxycycline 100 mg bid , reduce rate increase maximum transverse diameter small ( 3.5-5.0 cm among men 3.5 4.5 cm among woman ) abdominal aortic aneurysm . The primary outcome abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) maximum transverse diameter determine CT scan two-year follow-up allowance baseline ( pre-randomization ) diameter . Based anticipated growth rate 2.5 mm per year placebo group current threshold surgical intervention offer trial participant , ( 5.5 cm men , 5.0 cm woman ) , upper limit AAA size inclusion set 5.0 cm men 4.5 cm woman . Among subject , threshold repair would exceed exhibit persistent growth . Secondary outcome determine doxycycline affect measure , e.g. , MMP-9 level plasma whether effect relate aneurysm growth . Nineteen clinical site identify pool 1600 patient small aneurysm meet propose inclusion/exclusion criterion . Two hundred fifty-eight patient randomize placebo doxycycline aneurysm follow change diameter six-month interval use CT imaging . The alternative hypothesis doxycycline inhibit expansion rate 40 % two year observation . Patients enrol N-TA^3CT must able give consent participation meet study eligibility criterion .</detailed_description>
