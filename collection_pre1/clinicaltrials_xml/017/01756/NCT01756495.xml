	<brief_summary>This double-blind , 4-period , randomize , cross-over study conduct healthy adult subject . The purpose study characterize effect orally administer losmapimod electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameter focus cardiac repolarization measure correct QT interval ( QTc ) duration , compare placebo moxifloxacin . Moxifloxacin ( Avelox ) drug know potential create mild QTc interval prolongation ; therefore , serve positive control validate ability study detect change QTc interval . All subject participate 4 study period separate minimum washout period 5 day . Each subject receive one 4 regimen ( A = Losmapimod 7.5 milligram [ mg ] Twice daily [ BID ] x 5 day , B = Losmapimod 20 mg Once daily [ QD ] x 5 day , C = moxifloxacin 400 mg Day 5 , D = Losmapimod match placebo moxifloxacin placebo x 5 day ) 4 plan study period randomize , cross-over fashion . Subjects assign one four treatment sequence follow Williams design ( ABDC , BCAD , CDBA , DACB ) . Follow-up visit occur 10 14 day end Period 4</brief_summary>
