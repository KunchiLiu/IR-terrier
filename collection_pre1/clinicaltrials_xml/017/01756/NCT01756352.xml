	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The central hypothesis underlie propose research study FET-PET predict durable benefit patient receive anti-angiogenic benefit presumed recurrent GBM ( i.e . progression-free survival overall survival ) . We define one primary specific aim , expect obtain definitive result , two secondary aim , plan generate preliminary data support future , large project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FET-PET Evaluation Response Recurrent GBM Avastin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PET radiotracer FET provide measure large , neutral amino acid transport . This transport significantly upregulated malignant brain tumor . FET rarely give false positive finding set inflammation see high dose chemotherapy radiotherapy . FET label low-grade well high-grade glioma , contrast FDG , almost exclusively labels high-grade glioma . FET imaging may prove particularly useful set infiltrative tumor , contrast-enhancing MRI therefore detectable FDG . Management glioblastoma patient stable contrast-enhancing disease MRI increase sign edema difficult . This difficult distinguish simple edema infiltrative tumor . The former manage steroid latter manage chemotherapy , anti-angiogenic drug . FET may particularly useful assess change GBM patient receive anti-vascular agent Avastin . Avastin commonly use patient failure first-line treatment GBM . Not Avastin costly , also serious side effect internal bleed gastric perforation , severe hypertension , poor wound heal , renal toxicity . It important know patient fail Avastin treatment drug discontinue . Preliminary data Europe ( see figure ) suggest FET-PET accurately distinguish Avastin responder non-responders . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . GBM patient change MRI suggestive recurrence yet initiate antiangiogenic therapy . 2 . Age ≥ 18 3 . Anticipated survival &gt; 3 month 4 . Able give inform consent 5 . Capable undergoing scan without need sedation general anesthesia . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Active intracranial infection nonglial brain mass . 2 . Recent large intracranial hemorrhage ( &lt; 1 month ; size determine principal investigator ) 3 . Pregnant nursing . Quantitative serum hCG test perform prior initial -subsequent FET- PET scan female childbearing potential . Our BWH Radiation Safety Committee Partners IRB require stat serum ß-hcG pregnancy test . 4 . Patient live far BWH and/or unwilling/ unable return schedule image visit .</detailed_description>
