	<brief_summary>Recently , beneficial effect Meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) single automate thermal pulsation Lipiflow® system report several case report . In one study treatment compare hyperthermia ( iheat® ) 4 week . However , treatment recommendation lid hygiene accord MGD-report consist hyperthermia follow lid massage lid margin cleanse several month . To best investigator knowledge first randomize prospective study compare automate thermal pulsation treatment new Lipiflow ® system standard lid hygiene regime . The investigator suggest single treatment Lipiflow® superior lid hygiene regime .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Lipiflow®-Treatment Standard Lid Hygiene Regime</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once patient identify possible candidate study , he/she first inform verbally write study . After sign consent form he/she randomize either Lipiflow® treatment ( Lipiflow® group ) alternatively give instruction sheet verbal explanation lid warm massage ( lid hygiene group ) . After 3 month cross-over lid hygiene group Lipiflow® group conduct . A full examination perform 4 week 3 month therapy . All test perform physician trained graduate student Department Ophthalmology , Heinrich-Heine University . The examiner blind , i.e . know treatment patient receive receiving . Treatment Lipiflow® : The automate thermal pulsation Lipiflow® provide low risk therapy . After local anesthesia applicator insert . These look like kind goggles consist two part embrace eyelid front behind . Through rear part heat apply maximum 42.5° C. By isolate heat remain eyelid limited . Through front part gland massage perform . The treatment take 12 minute per eye do depend patient 's wish simultaneously one eye . The therapy approve FDA medical technical innovation also approve ISO CE Mark certification use Europe . Irritation minor trauma eyelid conjunctiva cornea , well violation eyelid conjunctiva cornea theoretically possible , extremely unlikely . Permanent damage eye report literature . In unlikely event , complication occur treatment , require additional treatment , perform department ophthalmology Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf . Test parameter : At time investigation , follow parameter evaluate : Lipiview® , Tear Lab® , Schirmer test , break-up time , corneal conjunctival fluorescein staining , Meibomian gland evaluation ( MGE ) , examination eyelid , Meibography , OSDI score , SPEED score All test parameter establish procedure common low risk harm patient . In detail : The Lipiview® device quantifies thickness lipid layer tear film use interferometry . For patient look kind camera recording tear film make , analyzed computer . Tear Lab® method measure tear film osmolarity . A pen-like instrument ( osmometer ) hold tear meniscus collect 100 nl tear within fraction second unit . There need local anaesthesia . By electrical impedance measurement , tear film osmolarity measure . The examiner read value digitally . The Schirmer test consist strip filter paper place conjunctival sac patient five minute . The filter paper absorbs tear fluid stain tear fluid line serve measure tear secretion . Tear break-up time time blink tear film show sign break . In study measure non-invasive Oculus-Keratograph 5 M® . The patient look kind camera recording tear film make analyze computer . Vital corneal conjunctival epithelium stain fluorescein . The dye adhere nonviable cell . The degree staining , judge investigator slit-lamp examination . For evaluation secrete meibomian gland specialize device ( Meibomian gland evaluator ) use , provide defined pressure lid . The examiner observe duct Meibomian gland assess many gland yield secretion . Examination eyelids do use slit lamp ass thicken significant vascularisation lid margin . To perform meibography lid illuminate infrared light . Functional acinus glands become clearly visible differentiated atrophic acinus . The number atrophic meibomian gland count score . OSDI ( Ocular-Surface-Disease-Index ) SPEED ( Standard Pattern Evaluation Eye Dryness ) questionnaires quantify symptom dry eye .</detailed_description>
