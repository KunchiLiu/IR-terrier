	<brief_title>Intestinal Decontamination With Rifaximin . The Inflammatory Circulatory State Patients With Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Ascites frequent complication cirrhosis , occur 50 % patient associate 50 % mortality two year . Bacterial infection patient cirrhosis frequent hospitalization important precipitate event development renal failure hepatorenal syndrome , hepatic encephalopathy possibly also variceal bleeding . High Child-Pugh Score , variceal bleed low ascitic fluid protein level associate high risk infection . The infection mainly trigger gut bacterial translocation , migration microorganism intestinal lumen mesenteric lymph node extra-intestinal site . Some study show derangement gut micro ecology patient liver cirrhosis , partly due decrease small intestinal motility , could cause small intestinal bacterial overgrowth . Combined structural functional alteration intestinal mucosa deficiency defense mechanism , bacterial overgrowth contribute bacterial translocation . Circulating bacterial DNA marker bacterial translocation may enhance endothelial dysfunction predict poor outcome cirrhosis ascites . Selective gut decontamination prevent spontaneous bacterial infection improve survival advanced cirrhosis , variceal bleeding patient spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) . Patients advanced cirrhosis , apart portal hypertension , characterize marked systemic vasodilatation , increase cardiac output low central blood volume . This could due raise level endotoxins blood induced inflammatory response . This induces increase expression activation nitrogen oxidase synthase lead excessive NO production vasodilatation . Moreover , high level cytokine ( LPS-BP , Interleukin-6 TNF-a ) , associate low systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) high cardiac output ( CO ) cirrhotic patient . In decompensated cirrhosis several vasoactive hormone activate counterbalance vasodilatation . In animal study , show oral antibiotic might reduce bacterial translocation vasodilatation splanchnic vasculature . Rifaximin seem attractive alternative exerts broad-range antimicrobial activity include gram-positive bacteria . Rifaximin induce less bacterial resistance act predominantly small intestine , site bacterial overgrowth cirrhosis . Rifaximin show reduce risk hepatic encephalopathy , less side effect traditional lactulose treatment . The hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) marker severity cirrhosis important prognostic value assessment risk complication cirrhosis . An uncontrolled study suggest rifaximin may decrease HVPG ( 8 ) . A recently publish pilot study furthermore suggest , rifaximin might improve systemic haemodynamics decrease cardiac output also increase glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Aim : This novel , investigational trial assess effect rifaximin pathophysiology haemodynamics patient liver cirrhosis , address effect rifaximin several organ marker level . We explore molecular physiological effect rifaximin rather confirm evidence already know beneficial effect . Hypothesis : We hypothesize intestinal decontamination rifaximin patient cirrhosis ascites interrupt bacterial translocation , diminish follow inflammatory response , prevent splanchnic vasodilatation portal systemic contraction thereby reduce risk clinical complication cirrhosis . Hence , rifaximin : 1 . Will decrease portal pressure , measure hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) . 2 . Will ameliorate peripheral splanchnic vasodilatation decrease cardiac output ( CO ) increase arterial blood pressure systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) . These effect also reflect trend towards normalization vasoactive hormone . 3 . Will improve renal function express increase glomerular filtration rate . 4 . Will regulate marker inflammation express decrease proinflammatory cytokine ( i.e . TNF-a interleukin ) high sensitivity CRP . 5 . Attenuate marker infection , express bacterial DNA lipopolysaccharide bind protein ( LPS-BP ) . 6 . Inhibit small intestinal bacterial overgrowth measure breath test intestinal transit-time subgroup patient . Methods : Trial design : This randomize , placebo control clinical trial . We aim randomize relation 2:1 , include 38 patient rifaximin treatment 19 patient placebo . These number base power calculation demand power 80 % probability true finding . Trial participant : Our trial population consist adult , legally competent patient liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh score B C ascites . Patients fulfill inclusion criterion recruit hospital capital region Denmark . The patient refer Hvidovre hospital liver vein catheterisation , diagnostic procedure include standard diagnostic programme liver cirrhosis . Initiation trial : The patient admit hospital baseline investigation perform , include clinical examination , blood sample , glucose breath test , blood urine culture , ascites puncture , faecal sample , examination continuous reaction time . On second day admission liver vein catheterization assessment renal function perform sample blood femoral artery hepatic vein drawn . Then patient randomize tablet rifaximin treatment placebo 28 day . During period treatment patient closely monitored outpatient visit contact telephone . End trial : At end trial period , patient re-hospitalized investigational programme repeat . After six month register follow Time schedule : November 2012 : Initiation trial enrollment first patient . November 2014 : Enrollment last patient investigation . May 2015 : End follow trial lock . Spring 2015 : Assessments analysis first data . Summer/Autumn 2015 : Publication result . Collaborating unit : Department Gastroenterology , Department Clinical Physiology Nuclear medicine , Unit Radiology Diagnostic Research Department Clinical Biochemistry , Clinical Research Centre , Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre . Rifaximin tablets placebo tablet deliver Norgine Denmark A/S , free cost , label packed Region Hovedstadens Apotek . The Good Clinical Practice Unit , Capital Region Denmark , monitor trial . Patients screen inclusion Departments gastroenterology , internal medicine hospital within Capital Region Denmark Implications trial : If rifaximin correct small intestinal bacterial overgrowth demonstrate improvement liver haemodynamics , renal function systemic dynamic , effect may contribute overall well-being patient prevent complication underlie cirrhosis risk infection , progression disease , admission hospital . It possible trial participant randomize rifaximin treatment experience improvement kidney function bowel function , less distress , flatulence diarrhea . It also possible group patient few complication cirrhosis , few admission hospital , few infection small risk variceal bleed SBP . It also possibility , certain , participant randomize rifaximin experience improvement mental status general condition , example less fatigue , good appetite strength . Participation trial contribute new knowledge foundation scientific background cause serious complication liver cirrhosis , thus enable u improve diagnosis treatment disease comorbidity . This pathophysiological investigational trial , besides mention benefit participant , also contribute possible development new treatment regimens liver cirrhosis . If intestinal decontamination rifaximin alleviate mechanism lead decompensation complication may potentially clinical impact advance cirrosis beyond prevent recurrent hepatic encephalopathy . The aspect prevention spontaneous bacterial peritonitis patient risk disease , potentially prophylaxis patient biochemical sign bacterial translocation .</detailed_description>
