	<brief_summary>Advances intensive care mechanical ventilation ( MV ) past two decade increase critically ill patient survival . However , patient require prolonged MV ( PMV ) deconditioned due respiratory insufficiency cause underlying disease , adverse effect medication , prolonged immobilization . Patients intensive care unit ( ICU ) often confine bed , result inactivity , immobility , severe osteomyoarticular system dysfunction . Our hypothesis early mobilization protocol improve peripheral muscle strength , perceive functional status , duration mechanical ventilation , ICU length stay critically ill patient . The purpose study evaluate effect implementation early mobilization protocol critically ill patient Intensive Care Unit University Hospital Santa Maria .</brief_summary>
