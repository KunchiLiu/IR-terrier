	<brief_title>The Effect Low Frequency STN DBS Sleep Vigilance Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In propose study , use within-subject randomized clinical trial measure objective change sleep architecture DBS `` '' compare effect different DBS stimulation parameter sleep architecture measure sleep study . The study design allow u address hypothesis low frequency deep brain stimulation parameter effective conventional setting improve sleep architecture wake-time vigilance . If hypothesis correct , low frequency setting could use sleep would prolong stimulator battery life , therefore decrease frequency require surgical battery change DBS . These data valuable consider clinical treatment strategy provide insight basic mechanism sleep dysfunction PD . The study may also contribute understand achieve maximum clinical benefit DBS minimize morbidity cost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects undergone bilateral subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) DBS surgery treatment PD . 2 . Stable DBS stimulator setting medication regimen least 6 week prior sleep study . 3 . Sleep dysfunction measure Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) ( score &gt; 5 ) 4 . 19 year age old 5 . Ability walk stairs 1 . Known narcolepsy 2 . Other previous surgical treatment Parkinson 's disease ( exception unilateral STN DBS ) include pallidotomy , thalamotomy , gene therapy procedure . 3 . Pregnant woman exclude study . 4 . Untreated obstructive sleep apnea . If obstructive sleep apnea discover first sleep study , subject remove study . After treat least 6 week continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , restart study . 5 . Inability walk without assistance , include cane , wheelchair , walker 6 . Cognitive dysfunction would prevent subject 's ability participate study . 7 . Blindness</criteria>
