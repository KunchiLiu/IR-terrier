	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) increase common disease . It range asymptomatic highly disable condition severe impact quality life . It term paroxysmal ( PAF ) episode last less 7 day , persistent ( PerAF ) last 7 day need intervention permanent ( PermAF ) accept long term rhythm . Treatment base symptom control prevention complication stroke . When attempt make restore normal sinus rhythm ( NSR ) , term 'rhythm control ' . Treatments rhythm control AF broadly divide pharmacological ablative . Ablative techniques1 typically perform percutaneously use catheter-based technology ( minimally invasive ) , though surgical technique also exist . They work principle perform series 'burns ' ( scar ) appropriate place prevent abnormal electrical signal form propagate within heart . The problem atrial fibrillation vast . Prevalence range 0.2 % 45-54 age group , rise 8 % 75s . Though majority patient satisfactorily treat medically , insignificant portion , drug either poorly tolerate ineffective . For patient , United Kingdom ( UK ) NICE guideline recommend consideration ablation procedure . In Derriford hospital alone see approximately 14 patient suitable AF ablation typical month . The electrophysiological consequence ablation unclear . It know whether complete bidirectional electrical block across ablation line isolate pulmonary antral region rest leave atrium prerequisite long-term cure Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) . Studies canine model atrial fibrillation suggest incomplete line block effective reduce AF burden complete line , however limited number follow study human assess patient recurrent AF also asymptomatic patient appear cure catheter ablation suggest complete electrical isolation pulmonary vein necessary cure . Advocates ablation without assess electrical block argue success rate human similar whether circumferential electrical isolation pulmonary vein achieve . Assessing freedom AF correlate presence absence complete bidirectional electrical block , intra-operatively post one-year follow-up , allow understand mechanism determine success failure AF ablation therapy . This important knowing treat patient AF still occur guide approach subsequent intervention . Though small risk involve study , question address significant impact development future AF ablation technique . Within group , 300 separate ablation procedure perform death significant complication . Previous group publish trans-septal observational study human demonstrate previous ethic committee appreciate importance work . The 2012 Heart Rhythm Society ( HRS ) /European Heart Rhythm Association ( EHRA ) /European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society ( ECAS ) consensus statement catheter surgical ablation AF recently highlight need novel trial design demonstrate 'durability pulmonary vein isolation ' repeat diagnostic electrophysiological study . This trial therefore increase understanding electrophysiological property associate successful ablation Atrial Fibrillation ablation HIFU procedure work .</detailed_description>
