	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I/II trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab give together local radiation therapy see well work treat patient recurrent melanoma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , colon , rectal cancer . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill cancer cell . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together radiation therapy may effective treatment melanoma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , colon , rectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Local Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Melanoma , Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma , Colon , Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To assess safety combine intratumoral anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA4 ) immunotherapy local radiation therapy patient melanoma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , colorectal carcinoma monotherapy ipilimumab safety lead-in . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To assess induction anti-tumor immune response use laboratory correlative study . 2 . To determine tumor response rate duration response unirradiated tumor sit patient advanced malignancy . 3 . To identify putative immunologic biomarkers tumor response . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study ipilimumab , follow phase 2 study . Only subject participated phase 1 portion study . The phase 2 portion study conduct . Patients receive ipilimumab intratumorally day 1 undergo local radiation therapy within 48 hour least 3 fraction . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 8 week , every 24 week 5 year .</detailed_description>
