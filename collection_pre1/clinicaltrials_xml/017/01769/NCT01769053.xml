	<brief_summary>In 2008 new ventilation strategy term variable Pressure Support ventilation ( PSV ) introduce , able increase variability respiratory pattern independent inspiratory effort . In experimental lung injury , variable PSV find improve gas exchange decrease inspiratory effort , reduce alveolar edema inflammatory infiltration compare conventional ( non-variable ) PSV . Importantly , variable PSV reduce peak airway pressure respiratory system elastance variability dependent manner.In addition , preliminary observation suggest variable PSV reduce work breathe improve patient comfort , know whether new ventilatory strategy able speed wean mechanical ventilation . Since variable PSV reduce mean pressure support , may lead fast reduction pressure support , therefore , short wean period conventional PSV . The hypothesis study variable pressure support ventilation reduces duration mechanical ventilation non-variable ( conventional ) pressure support ventilation .</brief_summary>
