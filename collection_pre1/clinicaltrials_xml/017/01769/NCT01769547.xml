	<criteria>Advanced incurable histologically confirm malignant pleural mesothelioma progress follow prior administration platinumantifolate base chemotherapy . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 . For patient pleural rind , measurable disease determine use modify RECIST criterion . Availability archival tissue . Less 18 year age . ECOG performance status &gt; 2 . Received &gt; two line systemic therapy . Patients receive last administration anticancer monoclonal antibody , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy ( except nitrosureas mitomycinC ) ≤ 4 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy . Patients receive last administration nitrosureas mitomycinC ≤ 6 week prior start study drug , recover side effect therapy . Patients receive radiotherapy ≤ 4 week prior start study drug recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity ( note : palliative radiotherapy bone lesion ≤ 2 week prior start study drug allow ) . Patients undergone major surgery ( e.g. , intrathoracic , intraabdominal , intrapelvic ) ≤ 4 week prior start study treatment recover side effect surgery . Prior use angiogenesis inhibitor . Patients another primary malignancy within 3 year prior start study treatment , exception adequately treat cancer basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer insitu carcinoma uterine cervix . ( Exception , patient localized prostate cancer treat within last 2 year currently hormonal therapy ) . Patients history pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) ≤ 6 month prior start study drug . Cirrhosis liver know hepatitis B C infection either acute consider chronic virus become undetectable : 1 . Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection : acute chronic infection depict positive HCV RNA test ( note : patient know antiHCV negative test HCV RNA , retesting HCV RNA 46 month later request confirm resolution HCV infection ) 2 . Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) infection : acute infection ( HBsAg+ without HBeAg+ detectable serum HBV DNA ) , HBV carrier evidence ongoing presence HBsAg detectable serum HBV DNA level Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection ( HIV test mandatory ) . Patients currently receive antiplatelet therapy prasugrel clopidogrel , full dose anticoagulation treatment therapeutic dos warfarin . However , treatment low dos warfarin ( e.g. , ≤ 2 mg/day ) locally accept low dos acetylsalicylic acid ( 100 mg daily ) prevent cardiovascular event stroke allow . Required use therapeutic dos coumarinderivative anticoagulant warfarin , although dos 2mg daily permit prophylaxis thrombosis . Note : Low molecular weight heparin permit provided patient 's PT INR &lt; 1.5 . Urine dipstick reading : Positive proteinuria , documentation +1 result protein dipstick reading , total urinary protein &gt; 500 mg measure creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m2 24 hour urine collection . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition dovitinib . Taking medication potent CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor ( dovitinib metabolize primarily CYP3A4 liver enzyme , every effort make switch patient take agent substance medication ) . History cardiac dysfunction ECHO MUGA scan outside institutional range normal patient impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include follow : 1 . History presence serious uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias 2 . Clinically significant rest bradycardia 3 . LVEF assess either 2D echocardiogram ( ECHO ) &lt; 50 % low limit normal ( whichever high ) , 2D multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) &lt; 45 % low limit normal ( whichever high ) 4 . Any follow within 6 month prior start study drug : myocardial infarction ( MI ) , severe/unstable angina , coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , transient ischemic Attack ( TIA ) 5 . Uncontrolled hypertension define SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 100 mm Hg , without antihypertensive medication ( ) . Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) allow prior study entry Preexisting condition ( e.g. , gastrointestinal tract disease ) , result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease impair ability swallow retain dovitinib tablet . Preexisting thyroid abnormality inability maintain thyroid function normal range medication . Patients follow condition : 1 . Clinically significant pulmonary GI bleeding great 30 cc precede 3 month 2 . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture , 3 . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day treatment . Patients brain metastasis . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g . active uncontrolled infection , uncontrolled diabetes ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . Any abnormal organ marrow function define : 1 . Leukocytes &lt; 3,000/microL 2 . Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/microL 3 . Platelets &lt; 100,000/microL 4 . Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) 5 . AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) &gt; 2.5X institutional ULN 6 . Amylase/lipase outside normal institutional limit 7 . Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5X ULN Creatinine clearance &lt; 60mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Pregnant lactate woman . Women childbearing potential , biologically able conceive , employ two form highly effective contraception . Note : Highly effective contraception ( e.g . male condom spermicide , diaphragm spermicide , intrauterine device ) must use sex ( female patient male partner ) study 30 day end study treatment . Contraceptives affect cytochrome P450 interaction ( e.g . oral , implantable , injectable , intrauterine hormonal contraceptive ) consider effective study . Women childbearing potential , define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) , must negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 14 day prior start study drug . Fertile male willing use contraception . Note : Fertile male must use condom spermicide . Highly effective contraception ( e.g . male condom spermicide , diaphragm spermicide , intrauterine device ) must use sex ( male patient female partner ) study 30 day end study treatment . Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Receiving investigational agent ( ) . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol . Inability understand unable provide write informed consent .</criteria>
