	<brief_title>Tivozanib Before Surgery Treating Patients With Localized Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility conduct trial tivozanib neoadjuvant set localize ( completely resectable ) renal cell cancer ( RCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tivozanib neoadjuvant setting . II . To compare tissue tivozanib pharmacodynamic purpose ( tumor infiltrate lymphocyte , myeloid derive suppressor cell , necrosis primary tumor exposure tivozanib ) . III . To assess overall response rate tivozanib primary tumor correlate radiographic change , , histo-pathological change pathology specimen post-nephrectomy . IV . To compare various growth factor ( vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] , interleukin-8 [ IL-8 ] , placenta growth factor [ P1GF ] ) baseline post treatment . V. To assess nephrectomy rate apply neoadjuvant tivozanib primarily resectable RCC population . OUTLINE : Patients receive tivozanib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . 25 day completion tivozanib , patient undergo curative nephrectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
