	<detailed_description>Main line study . Evolution patient 's health hospital discharge poorly document . We hypothesize information good quality concern might accessible relatively low cost patient , refer sentinel patient , would voluntary report health evolution dedicate website . The SENTIPAT study present proof concept study . It collect patient 's health evolution post-hospital discharge period 45 day . The study present randomize trial compare patient ' report issue two different method patient return home hospital discharge disposal internet connection available home ( refer `` eligible patient '' ) : `` Internet `` arm , sentinel patient solicit directly report data web-site especially devote collect data `` Telephone `` arm , data collect telephone interview 45 day hospital discharge . Investigations concern appearance/worsening symptom , healthcare resource utilization , quality life , patient ' satisfaction . Adverse event . An adverse event define non-related patient 's disease associate default excess care . A clinically significant event define one follow event : new symptom ( ) appear hospital discharge worsen symptom present hospital discharge , unscheduled rehospitalization consultation whatever reason , death ( patient lose follow-up investigated vital status ) . A validated event event consider adverse validation medical committee , blind term source declaration whatever source ( sentinel patient telephone survey ) . In addition , committee classify validate event accord criterion avoidability . Design . The main hypothesis study risk clinically significant validated adverse event least well report volunteer patient ( sentinel patient : Internet arm ) specific cohort follow-up ( Telephone survey arm ) . SENTIPAT present multi-center ( five department within hospital ) non-inferiority randomize trial compare internet telephone arm . Enrollment eligible patient perform basis consecutive patient discharge hospital participate department . Internet/Telephone randomization eligible patient stratify per department . In addition , order estimate distance representativeness eligible patient , substantial number patient internet access home ( refer `` non eligible patient '' ) also recruit compose third arm patient randomize : non eligible patient investigated via telephone interview 45 day discharge , patient Telephone arm . No intermediate analysis plan . Primary objective . The primary outcome criterion proportion patient report least `` clinically significant validate '' adverse event ( see definition ) occur period 45 day hospital discharge . The observed proportion Internet Telephone arm compare . Secondary objective . The secondary objective include : A ) relate primary criterion : - Nature , chronology , severity avoidability clinically significant adverse event - Proportion validate adverse event issue Internet Telephone report - Association adverse event occurrence ) patient 's perceived quality care/health ( SF-36 questionnaire , perceive health state-visual analogic scale-at admission , discharge , 45 day discharge ) , b ) post-discharge continuity care ( information transmit post-discharge referent physician ( ) patient ) . B ) relate proof concept sentinel patient : - Proportion eligible patient , active sentinel , characteristic compare patient population hospitalize department participate study . - Rate internet equipment utilization . - Rate participation completion questionnaire . - Estimate cost sentinel patient ' information system compare cost specific cohort survey . C ) relate objective assessing representativeness distance eligible patient : - Comparing whole set variable baseline ( i.e . inclusion , day hospital discharge ) non eligible eligible patient ( e.g. , socio-demographic characteristics-age , sex , social support- , hospital stay characteristics-reason , length , medication prescribe discharge- ) . - Comparing rate adverse event avoidable three arm ( Non Eligible , Eligible-Internet , Eligible-Telephone ) . - Making comparison relation hospital stay feature , post-discharge feature ( i.e . exclude post-discharge adverse event ) . - Measuring patient 's satisfaction ( SAPHORA-MCO© questionnaire ) quality life . The observed measure three arm compare . - Description healthcare resource utilized hospital discharge ( consultation include delay ) . Sample size . Calculation base non-inferiority two collection source ( Internet v Telephone ) clinically significant adverse event eligible patient . According Forster et al ( Ann Intern Med 2003 , Cmaj 2004 ) retain target 20 % patient present least event , equivalence limit 5 % . A 80 % power obtain inclusion 2050 patient , 1025 Internet arm , 1025 Telephone arm . In parallel , plan enroll 500 non eligible patient . The protocol plan total enrollment 2550 patient , 205 , 205 , 100 patient Internet , Telephone Non Eligible arm , respectively , five participate department . Statistical method . The result study present accord CONSORT recommendation adapt non-inferiority trial . Patients Internet Telephone arm constitute sample comparison internet telephone , constitute primary objective study . This population consider comparative cost study . Eligible v non eligible patient constitute sample study representativeness eligible patient sentinel vs non eligible patient . Primary analysis conduct use `` intention watch '' strategy , apply rule `` lose follow-up implies absence event correspond patient '' . Such imputation miss value appropriate reject non-inferiority hypothesis case important imbalance rate lose follow-up Internet Telephone group . However , intention treat usual non-inferiority trial . Therefore sensitivity analysis restrict patient follow-up data also conduct . Analysis primary outcome make determine bilateral 95 % confidence interval difference proportion patient least validate clinically significant adverse event Internet Telephone group , exclude value 5 % interval . Considering secondary analysis , within participate department , group comparison make use Mann-Whitney Kruskall-Wallis test quantitative variable , use Fisher 's exact test categorical variable , use Log-Rank test duration variable . Considering whole department , The Friedman test use quantitative variable Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test use categorical variable . Generalized linear regression model use multivariate analysis criterion within participate department ( multiple linear modeling , logistic regression , survival proportional hazard model ) generalize estimate equation model ( exchangeable correlation ) use department ' pool data . Analyses conduct use SAS R software . The primary perspective retain cost analysis hospital perspective . A complete analysis use societal perspective might consider later , include opportunity cost support sentinel patient . Most cost value directly issue study involve horary task value accord human capital approach . The cost sentinel surveillance include cost associate development maintenance associate information system . The cost telephone survey include relate call management organization operator human time . Time spent patient selection , inclusion , collection non-opposition agreement , event coding , validation , data analysis measure two group patient . Cost data balance participation rate questionnaire ' completion quality rate . In end , cost Internet Telephone strategy contrast corresponding detection rate adverse event . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio Telephone strategy v patient 's sentinel website estimate . Two situation consider : either limit study , website non-perennial , consider intensive use : example , model explore wide multi-center us website long period study ( latter imply increase maintenance cost also return investment website development ) . The cost-effectiveness ratio two situation may substantially differ two situation .</detailed_description>
