	<brief_summary>The primary goal work : ) establish unique collection mood disorder patient across life cycle , include child , adult geriatric patient , well-defined medical co-morbidities medication treatment outcomes University Hospitals Case Medical Center Department Psychiatry ; b ) establish collection nuclear family , include mother father , child diagnose mood disorder ; c ) perform systematic genetic analysis propose sample repository identify gene genetic variant contribute inter-patient variability clinical phenotype treatment response . Our primary hypothesis genetic variation may underlie individual variability disease susceptibility , clinical phenotype treatment safety , tolerability , effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study entail one-time blood draw use obtain phenotypic data DNA eligible mood disorder patient , parent ( applicable ) , treat within Psychiatry Department University Hospitals Case Medical Center ( UHCMC ) . In rare instance , participant unable cooperate blood draw , saliva sample collect instead draw blood . All eligible participant diagnose bipolar disorder major depressive disorder , parent child diagnose bipolar disorder major depressive disorder , see study visit Department Psychiatry University Hospitals Cleveland , 10524 Euclid Avenue , Cleveland , OH , 44106 . Required lab specimen collect University Hospitals Laboratory Services Department Psychiatry , analyze UHCMC Case Western Reserve University ( CWRU ) NIH sponsor sequence genotyping laboratory . DNA sample eligible subject undergo whole genome genetic analysis use array-based genotyping sequence technology . The clinical phenotype , treatment response profile genotype data analyze use single multivariate analysis order identify gene genomic region contribute inter-patient variability disease susceptibility , clinical phenotype treatment response . Alternatively , sequence cost decline continuously , DNA sample may undergo targeted genomic region deep sequence whole genome sequence analysis . Any clinical patient , research participant parent child patient , seven year old , within Department Psychiatry target enrollment . Eligible participant diagnose DSM-IV bipolar disorder ( type I , II , otherwise specify ) DSM-IV major depressive disorder , determine extensive clinical interview Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus ( MINI-Plus ) applicable parent child diagnose bipolar disorder major depressive disorder . The primary phenotype definition genetic analysis propose DSM-IV diagnosis ( BD MDD ) , phenotypic variable ( comorbidities etc . ) , treatment response , define either continuously ( change symptom measure ) categorically ( response/non-response ) , make basis structure diagnostic instrument . In summary , expect follow type phenotypic data ( show attach minimum data set CRF ) available majority participant : - Demographic information include gender , age ethnicity . - Psychiatric diagnosis history include age onset course mood disorder etc . - Family history illness include psychiatric disorder , diabetes cardiovascular disease . The additional clinical variable ( minimum dataset clinical trial ) may define mood disorder subtypes genetically homogeneous therefore likely reveal influence gene . Once participant sign informed consent form , blood sample approximately 4 teaspoon blood , saliva sample approximately half teaspoon saliva , collect DNA extraction . The DNA sample link phenotypic data collect study participant . The blood draw saliva collection minimum data set question procedure participant need complete decide participate study . The informed consent form specify demographic diagnostic information use study take participation within another study medical record clinical patient ; participant participate study provide consent use data retrospectively .</detailed_description>
