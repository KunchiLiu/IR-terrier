	<brief_summary>The recent swine origin influenza pandemic ( 2009 ) , new emergence swine origin H3N2v , delayed availability vaccine agent highlight need test optimize public health intervention strategy reduce transmission influenza . We use new technology biological particle collection ( U.S . Provisional Patent Application No . 61/162,395 , McDevitt et al. , Aerosol Sci Technol 2013 ) make fundamental observation infectious respiratory droplet study 200 naturally occur seasonal influenza case . We collect respiratory droplet shed participant breathe normally , talk , spontaneously cough . We characterize size distribution droplet contain infectious virus . We use basic data examine role large small respiratory droplet examine interaction host factor virus type impact shed infectious respiratory droplet . Subjects recruit web base respiratory illness surveillance system , health clinic advertisement campus community . Sitting collection booth create additional discomfort risk volunteer already suffer influenza infection . We recruit 1000 person symptoms acute respiratory illness screen collection nasopharyngeal swabs questionnaire . From among screened , recruit 250 give exhale breath sample , ask 50 people influenza return follow exhale breath sample two subsequent day . We hypothesize ( 1 ) fine aerosol ( &lt; 5 micron aerodynamic diameter ) contain viral copy coarse aerosol particle ( &gt; = 5 micron ) ( 2 ) fine aerosol contain culturable virus indicate fine aerosol infectious , ( 3 ) aerosol shed correlate virus load measure swab , ( 4 ) presence active cough sampling associate increase aerosol shed , ( 5 ) clinical symptom sign , include fever use predict viral aerosol shed .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study follow-on early project fund US Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) develop sampler study impact surgical mask reduce viral aerosol release person infect influenza virus . The funding organization direct control study design , execution , report access identifiable human data . The CDC IRB determine CDC engage human subject research cooperative agreement . Hypotheses : - Fine particle aerosol contain great number viral copy coarse aerosol particle . - Clinical symptom sign , include fever use predict viral aerosol shed - Fine aerosols contain culturable virus indicate fine aerosol infectious - Aerosol shed correlate virus load measure nasopharyngeal throat swab - Presence active cough sampling associate increase aerosol shed strong correlation find coarse fine particle virus aerosol</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Presence symptomatic respiratory infection evidence respiratory infection : During influenza season , subject enrol influenzalike illness ( symptoms fever either cough sore throat ) either positive point care rapid test influenza infection objectively document fever set document local influenza outbreak ( presence rapid test PCR confirm case ) . Onset within previous 48 hour Prior onset influenza season achieve enrollment target population end flu season , enroll subject cough , coryza ( stuffy runny nose , sore throat , sneeze ) , malaise ( fatigue ) characteristic 'common cold ' often result Human Rhinovirus , RSV , parainfluenza , extent influenza virus .</criteria>
