	<brief_summary>Objective : Demonstrate safety early use dabigatran follow TIA/minor stroke . Background : Although aggressive antithrombotic therapy show reduce number new ischemic event follow stroke/TIA , always offset increase risk hemorrhagic transformation . Dabigatran much safe previously test antithrombotic agent , respect intracranial bleeding therefore offer unique treatment opportunity high-risk patient . TIA/minor stroke represent large group cerebrovascular disease patient . A short-term intervention 30 day dabigatran treatment potential large impact population health perspective , give number patient may treat benefit demonstrate . Study design : This open label , single arm study . Patients TIA/minor stroke ( National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score &lt; /=3 ) treat within 24 hour symptom onset eligible . All patient treat dabigatran 30 day . The dose dabigatran determine age renal function ( patient &gt; 80 year old and/or GFR 30-50 ml/min receive 110 mg bid , patient receive 150 mg BID ) .The primary endpoint symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation . Patients ( n=50 ) TIA/minor stroke , define National Institutes Health Stroke Scale Score &lt; /=3 , undergo MRI , include diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) , well gradient recall echo ( GRE ) sequence , use assess hemorrhagic transformation . Patients repeat MRI examination 7 30 day assess hemorrhagic transformation new lesion development . The primary endpoint phase I symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation , define parenchymal hematoma day 7 MRI scan ( GRE sequence ) , associate clinical worsening ( &gt; /=4 point increase National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score ) . If dabigatran use safely population , second phase aim demonstrate rate new ischemic lesion development follow TIA reduce aggressive antithrombotic therapy . A randomized open-label , blind endpoint evaluation design employ . The investigator hypothesize dabigatran therapy administer within 24 hour symptom onset reduce rate new ischemic lesion , relative standard care , one week 30 day onset .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dabigatran Treatment Following Transient Ischemic Attack Minor Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) traditionally define focal neurologic deficit last less 24 hour , alternative definition base tissue injury recently proposed.1 This clinical definition base assumption TIAs associate complete resolution brain ischemia occur rapidly enough cause transient symptom permanent brain injury , i.e . stroke . A recently complete MRI research study University Alberta indicate TIA minor stroke actually represent continuum symptom secondary brain ischemia.2 There also substantial evidence period shortly TIA minor stroke one elevate recurrent stroke risk ; high 17 % 3 months.3 , 4 We previously report MRI marker new infarction actually present within 7 day index event 18 % patients.2 TIA minor stroke therefore see sentinel warn impend major stroke , offer potential window therapeutic intervention . Given large number patient suffer TIA/minor stroke , important identify target patient high risk early recurrence . Treatment Minor Stroke/TIA : A logical approach prevent early recurrence aggressive hyperacute antithrombotic therapy follow TIA/minor stroke , standard care acute coronary syndrome management . This treatment strategy aim prevent recurrent thromboembolism propagation exist thrombus . In acute coronary syndrome patient , antithrombotic therapy consist anticoagulant ( low molecular weight heparin ) combination antiplatelet agent ( ASA+high dose clopidogrel , recently prasugrel/ticagrelor ) . In ischemic stroke patient benefit traditional anticoagulant , particularly heparin , consistently offset increase incidence intracranial hemorrhagic complications.5 Combination antiplatelet therapy sometimes use empirically follow TIA/minor stroke , although may ideal approach either . A previous trial 392 patient demonstrated trend towards reduction recurrent event day 90 patient treated combination ASA clopidogrel 90 day ( Absolute Risk Reduction = 3.3 % [ 95 % CI -1.9 , 9.4 ] ) , also complicate excess hemorrhagic event . The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran effective antithrombotic agent show superior warfarin prevention cardioembolic ischemic stroke . Dabigatran unique unlike antithrombotic drug study cerebrovascular disease , appear associate much low risk intracranial hemorrhagic complication , include intracerebral subdural hemorrhages.7 This therefore appear ideal drug treatment acute cerebrovascular syndrome patient . MRI Surrogate Outcome Marker TIA/Minor Stroke : Our previous serial MRI study indicate rate new DWI lesion development TIA minor stroke population 22 % 30 day importantly 92 % lesion develop within first 7 day initial symptoms.2 The majority ( 90 % ) patient develop new lesion baseline DWI lesion area hypoperfusion evident perfusion image . Thus stroke 'recurrence ' fact appear represent completion natural history acute cerebrovascular syndrome . Having identify high-risk group patient , aim reduce rate development new lesion . DWI lesion load show highly predictive neurological functional recovery follow ischemic stroke , make ideal surrogate outcome marker small phase IIa study . The investigator design two-phase study aim demonstrate safety ( phase I ) efficacy ( phase II ) acute dabigatran treatment follow TIA/minor ischemic stroke . Phase I describe . The final design phase II dependent result Phase I . Study Aim Design Phase I : The primary aim phase I demonstrate safety early use dabigatran follow TIA/minor stroke . Phase I open label , single arm study . Patients TIA/minor stroke ( National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score &gt; /=3 ) treat within 24 hour symptom onset eligible . All patient treat dabigatran 30 day . The dose dabigatran determine age renal function ( patient &gt; 80 year old and/or GFR 30-50 ml/min receive 110 mg bid , patient receive 150 mg BID ) .The primary endpoint symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation . Patients ( n=50 ) TIA/minor stroke , define National Institutes Health Stroke Scale Score &lt; /=3 , undergo MRI , include diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) , well gradient recall echo ( GRE ) sequence , use assess hemorrhagic transformation . Patients repeat MRI examination 7 30 day assess hemorrhagic transformation new lesion development . The primary endpoint phase I symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation , define parenchymal hematoma day 7 MRI scan ( GRE sequence ) , associate clinical worsening ( &gt; /=4 point increase National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score ) . Sample Size : Phase I open label , single arm study . The primary endpoint symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation . A total 50 patient treated dabigatran . A priori stopping rule , base expect number patient experience hemorrhagic transformation group size , employ .</detailed_description>
