	<detailed_description>Background Drug misusers present addiction service wide range problem serious consequence drug overdose threat life . Accurately predict risk suffer drug overdose therefore play crucial role effective prevention drug overdose . So far , effect focus investigate predictive variable relate drug misusers ' subjective perception cop ability measure life experience treatment history . However , little attention direct factor associate aspect addiction consultation process , clinician great degree control patient interaction . Some initial empirical evidence suggest clinician ' patient ' facial expression predictive suicidal reattempt . It find doctor show high frequency intensity frown work suicide repeater non-repeaters . In addition , repeater patient find high activity mouth look downwards significantly often . This line study lay foundation new way prediction observation clinician-patient interaction . We therefore interested explore non-verbal behaviour clinicians patient consultation process potentially predictive patient 's risk suffer drug overdose . Regarding verbal communicative behaviour consultation process might influence patient care outcome , finding healthcare communication area consistently demonstrate patient-centred communication positively correlate improved patient health outcome . One key feature patient-centred consulting style clinician ' ability verbally recognize address individual patient ' emotional distress . To knowledge , first time investigate clinician manage patient ' emotional distress affect patient care outcome drug service set . No validated coding scheme far develop explore relationship aspect interaction drug service outcome . In area healthcare communication , Verona Coding Definitions Emotional Sequences ( VR-CoDES ) frequently use code patient expression emotional distress provider response . Although widely use variety context psychiatric context dental setting , yet use consultation involve drug user . We therefore interested test applicability system drug service set suitable modification . Drug addiction consultation usually emotion-provoking environment accurate perception patient emotion become precondition empathic response . The modification validate cod scheme suitable drug service context first useful tool help clinician recognize patient ' emotional concern thereby improve quality patient care . With modified version VR-CoDES analysis tool , aim identify factor associate aspect consultation process , particularly verbal non-verbal behaviour clinicians patient , improve understand drug misusers ' risk suffer drug overdose . The main research question summarize . Research question - What communicative behaviour observe interaction clinician drug user patient predictive patent 's risk suffer drug overdose ? In word , interested explore verbal non-verbal behaviour clinicians patient consultation process predict patient 's risk suffer drug overdose . - We also interest explore clinician respond patient ' expression emotional distress consultation process successful management emotional worry might relate improved patient satisfaction . Furthermore , keen investigate whether Verona Coding Definitions Emotional Sequence ( VR-CoDES ) reliably apply drug consultation context suitably modify . In word , whether patient ' expression emotional cue concern clinician ' response identify reliably cod use modify VR-CoDES . Research design It one year , pilot observational study video record clinician-patient consultation within single site NHS Fife Addiction Services , base Whyteman 's Brae Hospital Kirkcaldy . In future , site may consider achieve large sample size pilot study complete NHS Fife single site , largely due time constraint . The Overdose Risk Assessment Questionnaire ( ORA ) Treatment Outcomes Profile Questionnaire ( TOP ) two questionnaire already routinely use Addiction Nurses within NHS Fife Addition Services . We hope exert minimum extra workload staff participant respect normal implementation procedure questionnaire . Two piece information obtain ORA questionnaire include analysis . First , overall risk assessment score first assessment key worker video observation use compare behavioural factor emerge interaction predict patient drug overdose risk . For example , high risk assessment score might correlate high frequency patient 'looking ' non-verbal behaviour . Second , relevant information , depression emotional abuse , use predictor patient expression emotional distress consultation . Therefore regression correlational analysis conduct . Similarly , two piece information select TOP questionnaire include analysis study . First , number day patient injected non-prescribed drug past four week obtain one month video record session . This information use indicator patient risk suffer drug overdose , primary outcome study . Frequency duration behavioural data gather consultation interaction ( e.g. , clinician 's 'frowning ' , patient 's 'looking ' ) correlate outcome variable ( i.e. , number day patient inject drug ) . Second , patient 's rating overall quality life obtain TOP questionnaire use measure patient satisfaction secondary outcome study . Patient satisfaction also measure specifically developed questionnaire immediately consultation . Again , multiple regression analysis employ explore relationship predictor outcome variable . Methods • Main ethical issue The main ethical issue involve study relate record storage image clinicians drug user patient anonymity confidentiality participant ' information . We take every possible step address ethical issue include additional safeguard action deal unexpected incident . First , initial raw data record DVDs lock metal case temporary storage field secure locked cabinet University St Andrews transportation field University complete . Second , raw DVD file ( i.e. , patient consultation ) assign unique code digitalize store university computer internal hard disc cod analysis . Third , digitalize file permanently remove computer cod analysis complete . They export , face image digitally blur , onto external hard drive data encrypt access data file password protect . These encrypt data store two year follow end study original raw data DVDs permanently destroy end project . An audit record compile allow inspection progress video data file video DVD computer hard disc cod export external medium safe long-term storage . Audit monitor School Ethics Committee 6-month basis . It important note face participant video data permanently digitally obscured coding complete . We display video file wider audience ( e.g. , conference ) face image blur informed consent relevant participant obtain . In order protect anonymity personal detail confidentiality information provide participant , assign unique code participant participant identify data file . This cod book lock secure place research team member access . • Participants Sampling framework : In order answer research question aspects clinician-patient interaction addiction consultation predict drug misusers ' risk suffer drug overdose , seem population interest clinician patient provide use addiction service UK . In practice , ideal random sample proportionate stratify sample drawn population often feasible due limit resource time constraint . The sampling procedure adopt current study mix opportunity purposive sampling . Opportunities present form patient refer NHS Fife Addiction Services eligible staff member patient base Whyteman 's Brae service site invite take part . Sampling also purposive first session CDAS Addiction Nurse , patient naive Addiction Nurse regard interaction experience , use study interaction . It also consider important sample patient participant include approximately equal proportion men woman ; age profile representation young middle age group . Additionally , also important consider demographic information age , sex work experience sample staff participant . Inclusion exclusion criterion : All CDAS Addiction Nurses , provide one-to-one consultation service patient , base Whyteman 's Brae Hospital part NHS Fife Addiction Services eligible . All patient refer NHS Fife Addiction Services Fife wide triage contact point GPs , first session CDAS Addiction Nurses , eligible . Patient mental health problem well whose first language English exclude . Recruitment procedure : Staff participant recruit combination top-down bottom-up approach . Meetings head service team leader ( top-down approach ) discussion staff member ( bottom-up approach ) take place simultaneously , introduce project encourage participation . At staff team meeting , information project consent form opt-in reply slip leave meeting time ( 3-4 day ) decide whether willing participate . The consent form return research assistant prepay address envelope . We need minimum number 16 staff participant preferably four male four female 25-65 year old . Newly qualify stff member encourage participate well experience one . Obtaining patient consent achieve mainly help addiction service . An invitation package deliver potential patient participant Addiction Services behalf research team . As need minimum number 16 consultation session ( eight clinician two patient per clinician ) , patient participant preferably eight woman ( four 18-40 year old four 41-65 year old ) eight man ( four 18-40 year old four 41-65 year old ) . The invitation package include invitation letter , project information sheet consent form . Patients also give 3-4 day decide participate . The consent form return research assistant prepay address envelope . • Procedures data collection Observations clinician-patient interaction addiction consultation take place consultation room Whyteman 's Brae Hospital Kirkcaldy form audio-visual recording . The whole process record take 30 minute depend complexity individual case . It expect presence camera researcher detrimental effect clinician ' delivery service , likely upset patient . We use small sized digital camera place good distance ( approximately 2m clinician patient ) . The operation record system well practised setup complete good time minimize possible disturbance participant . The recording storage video file strictly follow ethical procedure describe main ethical issue application form , digitally obscure face image relevant participant secure data file lock cabinet . According research design ( collect minimum 16 consultation session eight staff participant two patient per staff member ) availability Addiction Nurses Whyteman 's Brae Hospital , 10 date proposal , expect Addiction Nurse participate average number approximately two video record session , last 60 minute total . This average 60-minute total observation time Addiction Nurse could spread 5 6 day depend appointment his/her patient . The total participation time patient participant video record session 30 minute depend complexity case . If either clinician patient feel unhappy record point observation , record stop immediately record data destroy . The Overdose Risk Assessment Questionnaire Treatment Outcomes Profile Questionnaire implement part routine practice Addiction Nurses . The Patient Satisfaction Survey , specially develop study , hand patient research assistant video observation . It complete within 5 minute end consultation . Patients advise complete survey absence clinician return letter box place Reception . This avoid possible pressure provide positive comment front clinician protect confidentiality information . There follow-up question initial survey complete . • Data analysis All video data analyse use Observer XT system . First , verbal non-verbal behaviour clinicians patient cod use modify VR-CoDES cod scheme . Both inter- intra-coder reliability check satisfactory level ( i.e. , Kappa ≥ .70 ) . Second , frequency duration certain behaviour calculate identify possible relationship certain behaviour outcome variable ( i.e. , risk suffer drug overdose and/or patient satisfaction ) . Third , sequential analysis employ detect pattern behaviour identify complex behavioural relationship . In addition , cod behaviours export statistical package analyse SPSS . Data gather survey method , patient satisfaction consultation patent previous depression use either outcome predictor variable correlate behavioural variable interaction .</detailed_description>
