	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) paramount diagnosis evaluation cancer involve gastrointestinal tract . EUS allow acquisition cellular ( fine needle aspirate - FNA ) tissue biopsy ( fine needle biopsy - FNB ) diagnostic purpose . This traditionally do fine needle aspirate needle insert tumor potentially malignant cell extract microscopic analysis . More recently , needle allow tissue biopsy histologic analysis FDA approve . The Echotip Procore ( Cook Medical ) core biopsy needle ( ETP ) , demonstrate provide excellent efficacy core biopsy sample . Final diagnostic yield use needle range 80-90 % appear significantly great EUS-FNA lesion require histology diagnosis . However , currently limit data prospective study compare EUS-FNA EUS-FNB ETP needle . The investigator propose randomize , prospective , cross-over study compare diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA EUS-FNB .</brief_summary>

This traditionally do fine needle aspirate needle insert tumor potentially malignant cell extract microscopic analysis . More recently , needle allow tissue biopsy histologic analysis FDA approve . We compare tissue sample obtain standard FNA FNB sample size 140 patient primary outcome diagnostic yield . Each patient randomize FNA FNA . If 3 pass on-site evaluation remain inadequate , endoscopist crossover arm .</detailed_description>
