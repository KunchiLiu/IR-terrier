	<brief_summary>With improvement response rate survival see HER2 positive patient treat HER2 blockade metastatic setting , use HER2 blockade neoadjuvant set increase antitumor effect show promise . Patients previously untreated localize HER2 positive esophageal , GE junction gastric adenocarcinoma enrol . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion receive neoadjuvant treatment concurrent chemotherapy radiation therapy begin day 1 treatment . During lead-in safety portion , optimal dose lapatinib determine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 5-FU , Oxaliplatin , &amp; Lapatinib Combined With Radiation Therapy Treat HER2 Positive Esophagogastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , Phase II study lead-in safety cohort . The study evaluate combination 5-Fluorouracil , Oxaliplatin Lapatinib radiation therapy neoadjuvant treatment patient previously untreated localize HER2 positive esophagogastric adenocarcinoma . Approximately 12 patient enrol lead-in cohort evaluate safety combination . Following lead-in cohort , Phase II commence 30 additional patient may treat . The starting dos administer follow : 5-FU 225 mg/mg2 continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion Days 1 - 42 XRT ; Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 Days 1 , 15 29 , give IV infusion , per institutional standard ; Lapatinib Continuous PO daily dose XRT ( final dose determine lead-in cohort ) .</detailed_description>
