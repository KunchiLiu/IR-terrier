	<brief_summary>This study build previous research provide compelling evidence deficient activity glucocorticoid endometrium cause increase menstrual bleeding . This study aim demonstrate glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone ) , already common use condition , ( eg treat medical condition asthma rheumatoid arthritis early pregnancy ) , reverse endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency result reduce menstrual blood loss . The study two stage , 12 month workup stage 3 year , response adaptive , dose-finding randomise controlled trial . The first stage involve two workup clinical study gather preliminary safety efficacy data first-in-Heavy Menstrual Bleeding use oral dexamethasone . They also provide methodological data series simulation study determine robust adaptive trial design specification . Workup study 1 : unblinded , six patient give Dexamethasone ( 0.75mg twice daily ) 5 day two consecutive menstrual cycle endometrial biopsy MRI two occasion ( nontreated cycle , second cycle treat Dexamethasone ) . Workup study 2; doubleblind crossover trial 14 woman -2 treatment block two cycle , either placebo Dexamethasone ( 0.75mg twice daily ) , randomise order treatment block - placebo Dexamethasone , vice-versa . Adaptive trial : 48 month double-blind , placebo control trial 108 woman evaluate effect Dexamethasone across range dos aim identify optimal dose study subsequent Phase III trial . Participants randomise receive one 6 active dos placebo 3 menstrual cycle . All study involve ask participant complete menstrual diary carry menstrual blood loss collection objectively measure blood loss . The investigator ' propose approach novel use synthetic glucocorticoid `` rescue '' luteal phase deficiency cortisol , thus improve endometrial vasculature hence vasoconstriction menses commences , thus reduce menstrual bleeding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Menstrual bleeding complaint affect quality life comprise substantial societal burden , include major impact health care use cost . Current medical therapy heavy menstrual bleeding ( HMB ) often ineffective and/or associate unacceptable side effect . There unmet clinical need target , effective , medical treatment strategy HMB . The investigator ' finding research mechanisms HMB lead conclusion woman HMB enhance endometrial inactivation cortisol 11βHSD2 result local endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency , change prostaglandin ( PG ) production , altered structure deficient vasoconstriction endometrial vasculature . The investigator therefore anticipate luteal phase `` rescue '' endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency provide novel approach therapy woman HMB . The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( Dex ) potent cortisol surrogate glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) agonist resists 11βHSD2 inactivation . In non-human primate study investigator observe striking reduction menstrual blood loss Dexamethasone administration . Objectives The investigator aim show proof-of-concept Dexamethasone administration woman HMB improve capacity endometrial vasculature efficient vasoconstriction menses commences , hence reduce menstrual bleeding . The investigator ' proposal novel use exist , well-characterised medical treatment ( Dex ) . Methods The Investigators propose parallel group randomise control trial woman HMB compare Dexamethasone ( range potential dos ) placebo treatment . The trial design response-adaptive , whereby randomisation probability change across time ensure maximum information obtain critical region underlie dose-response curve ( contain 'optimum ' dose ) . This added advantage relatively woman randomise dos emerge effective . Such design parsimonious way enable robust demonstration therapeutic effect Dexamethasone HMB , reliable identification optimal dose take forward future study Phase III trial . Work Up Stage Adaptive design require work stage enable simulation model necessary determine robust final design specification adequate power ( , expect number patient require lie range 100-108 ) . In addition work stage allow two clinical study execute . Data collect inform modelling simulation , also enhance mechanistic pharmacodynamic understanding observe Dexamethasone effect , invaluable preliminary check safety 'first-in-HMB ' use oral Dexamethasone . These study involve treat total 20 woman HMB two cycle Dexamethasone ( 1.5mg daily ) .</detailed_description>
