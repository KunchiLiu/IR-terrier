	<brief_summary>This research study test different dos RG-HRV16 find minimum dose need give research subject cold symptom least moderate intensity . The study also test safety RG-HRV16 . This information use future study ( example , test antiviral preparation , spray could protect get cold decrease cold symptom understand rhinovirus lead asthma worsen ) . RG-HRV16 common cold virus make new way use human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A First-in-Human Safety Dose-Finding Study New Type-16 Human Rhinovirus ( RG-HRV16 ) Inoculum Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhinoviruses frequently cause common cold . HRV16 ( Family Picornaviridae Genus Rhinovirus type 16 ) use extensively induce cold study experimentally inoculated volunteer design study pathogenesis cold effect antiviral medication . Experimental inoculation human rhinovirus type 16 ( HRV16 ) administer intranasally via aerosolization use University Wisconsin 30 year , proven safe tool reproducibly induce symptomatic cold . HRV link exacerbation asthma COPD , model use evaluate inflammatory mechanism test efficacy treatment common cold . Recent refinement technology available produce safety test reagent intend administered human volunteer part research protocols prompt u produce new lot HRV16 accordance standard current Good Manufacturing Procedures ( cGMP ) . For inoculum , use cDNA clone ( reverse genetics ) generate source virus , thus new virus inoculum refer RG-HRV16 . This approach two main advantage use virus isolate nasal secretion . First , several `` new '' respiratory virus ( e.g . metapneumovirus , bocavirus , SARS , rhinovirus group C ) discover past 10 year , little doubt additional virus discover . Therefore , impossible ensure nasal secretion choose isolation `` seed virus '' contain pathogen interest . This problem minimize use virus derive cDNA clone produce E. coli . Second , RNA viruses , HRV , mutate virus grow RNA polymerases error-correcting function . The cDNA clone , reproduce much accurate E. coli DNA polymerase , provide stable source virus sequence production future inoculum . This study represent first-in-human , phase 1 study assess safety RG-HRV16 human identify dose need produce moderate-to-severe cold 75 % HRV16-seronegative human volunteer .</detailed_description>
