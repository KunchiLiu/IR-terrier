	<brief_title>Exercise-induced Bronchoconstriction School Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Patients Study design It two-step study carry among school teenager . In first step school child screen EIB physical education ( PE ) lesson . Inn child physical exercise ( PE ) lesson spirometry perform . Children decrease FEV1 ( &gt; =10 % baseline ) and/or child EIB history within last 12 month ( symptom : dyspnea , cough , wheeze , chest pain during/after exercise ) invite clinic future evaluation qualify next step study . In second step child suspect EIB parent invite clinic . Three visit plan . Treatment long act beta agonist stop 24 hour visit ; antihistamine treatment stop 21 day first visit . First visit In child standardize exercise trade mil challenge together reversibility test skin prick test perform . Based result child divide follow group : - child EIB asthma ( EIB+A+ ) - child EIB without asthma ( EIB+A- ) - child without EIB asthma ( EIB-A+ ) - child without EIB without asthma ( EIB-A- ) Second visit Twenty child randomly select group . In child standardize exercise trade mil challenge perform together . Blood sample take challenge together exhale breath condensate sample order detect marker inflammation . Also exercise challenge exhale nitric oxide measure . Third visit Bronchial provocation challenge metacholine perform child . Methods - medical history physical examination - lung function test Pulmonary function test Pulmonary function test perform Master Screen unit ( Erich Jaeger Gmbh-Hochberg , Germany ) . Predicted value lung function variable base previous study healthy control provide manufacturer lung function test equipment . Flow-volume curve perform accord American Thoracic Society standard . The high 3 successful measurement take analyzed . The result express percentage predict value . All subject able perform spirometry . - exhale nitric oxide measurements The NO measurement perform accord European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society ( ERS/ATS ) recommendation chemiluminescence analyzer ( model 280i nitric oxide analyzer ; Sievers , Boulder , CO , USA ) deaned part per billion . The analyzer provide on-line continuous measurement NO single exhalation detection range 0.1 500 ppb . Environmental NO measure test never exceed 5 ppb . All subject study sit position , without wear nose clip . The subject exhale constant ﬂow rate ( 50mL/s ) total lung capacity residual volume without breath hold . They maintain constant mouth pressure ( 17 cm H2O ) monitor visual display order eliminate contamination nasal NO . Dead space nasal NO ( reﬂected NO concentration peak exhalation ) NO low respiratory tract ( determine plateau value peak ) record automatically use manufacturer 's software . Three fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) measurement plateau phase obtain , less 10 % variation . The mean value 3 successive , reproducible recording retain statistical analysis . - standardized exercise treadmill challenge Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction test use motor-driven treadmill ( Kettler , Ense-Parsit , Germany ) accord ATS/ERS guideline . The child instruct run 8 minute submaximal exercise load . The exercise test consist 2-minute warm-up 6 minute steady-state run treadmill incline produce heart rate least 95 % maximum predict age ( calculated 220 − age [ year ] ) . The slope treadmill 5.5 % ( 3° ) . Small adjustment workload ( treadmill speed ) make , necessary , achieve target hearth rate . Nasal clip use test , heart rate continuously monitor ( electronic heart rate scanner ; Kettler ) . The submaximal run treadmill perform speed ( exercise load ) test occasion ( randomization 4 week treatment ) child . The ambient temperature air-conditioned laboratory keep stable 22°C , humidity stable 40 % 50 % day study . Differences 1°C temperature 5 mg H2 OxL−1 air humidity test day patient accept . 14 FEV1 measure run , immediately , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , 20 30 minute run . Maximum percentage fall FEV1 exercise test calculate use follow formula : [ ( pre-exercise FEV1 - low postexercise FEV1 ) /pre-exercise FEV1 ] x 100 . The FEV1 value plot time treatment . The area curve ( AUC ) FEV1 value exercise 30-minute period calculate use trapezoidal rule . EIB define ≥ 15 % decrease FEV1 baseline within first 5 minute exercise . - exhale breath condensate EBC sample collect EcoScreen-II device ( Viasys Healthcare GmbH , Berlin , Germany ) . Samples exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) obtain child tidal breathe wear nose clip , describe previously [ 6 ] . The two-way non-rebreathing valve tube condenser serve saliva trap . After collection ( 10min ) , EBC rapidly freeze small plastic tube -80°C use dry ice store -80°C analysis . The material exhale breath condensate child diagnose asthma . The analysis perform use Quantibody Human Inflammation Array 3 ( RayBiotech , Norcross , GA , USA ) accord manufacturer 's instruction . This multiplex ELISA array kit allow quantitative measurement 40 human cytokine . Each standard glass slide consist 16 well , identical cytokine antibody array . All antibody positive control print quadruplicated every well . In first step , capture antibody bound glass surface slide . Next , 100 µl patient sample aray specific cytokine standard know concentration add well . After incubation 2 hour room temperature , array wash 5 time 150 µl Wash Buffer I twice 150 µl Wash Buffer II , 5 minute per wash. Next , array incubate 2 hour 1.4 ml biotin - conjugate antibody room temperature . Then wash protocol repeat addition 80 µl Cy3 equivalent dye-conjugated streptavidin well 1 hour . After wash array , fluorescence signal detect quantified Axon GenePix 4000B scanner GenePix Pro 6.0 software ( Molecular Devices ) . The result analyze use Q - Analyzer Software ( RayBiotech , Norcross , GA , USA ) . - metacholine bronchial provocation challenge Metacholine bronchial test provocation perform use dosimeter technique aerosol provocation system ( APS ) Pro ( Erich Jaeger Gmbh-Hochberg , Germany ) control tidal breathing . After pulverization physiological diluent , methacholine deliver four cumulative dos : 0,015 mg , 0,045mg , 0,18mg , 0,72mg . Metacholine base provocation test ( MBPT ) continue 2-min interval inhalation fall forced expiratory volume 1 ( FEV1 ) ≥20 % obtain . Provocative dose ( PD20 ) calculate linear interpolation log-dose-response curve ( 13 ) . - blood sample ( 5 ml sample ) : tryptase , lipoxin A4 serum level - also present study blood sample take challenge together exhale breath condensate sample order detect marker inflammation ( interleukin ( IL ) -1a , IL-2 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-9 , IL-12p70 , IL-13 , IL-17 , IL-22 , monocyte chemoattractant protein one ( MCP1 ) , toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) , macrophage inflammatory protein one alfa ( MIP1a ) , platelet derive growth factor ( PDGFBB ) , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase two ( TIMP2 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , transform growth factor beta one ( TGF-b1 ) , thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) - ELISA cysteinyl leukotrienes , leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , prostaglandin E2 - high pressure liquid chromatography ( ( PGE2-HPLC ) ) /mass spectrometry ) . Meaning : Practical assessment/The result propose study allow u assess prevalence define inflammatory background exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) school child . School absence , morbidity , co-morbidity affect physical activity verify undiagnosed patient treat . Significance environmental ( tobacco smoking , type exercise , temperature humidity exercise room ) individual ( age , gender , atopy , obesity , recurrent respiratory truck infection , presence chronic disease ) factor verify . New findings/Main finding study allow define primary prevention method EIB without exercise avoidance , new recommendation EIB treatment child : 1 . EIB screen real live environment ( exercise lesson school ) verify standardized exercise test clinic 2 . Defining individual environmental risk factor EIB school child 3 . Kinetics inflammatory marker ( exhale breath condensate serum ) exercise test 4 . Complex evaluation clinical inflammatory profile patient EIB with/without asthma . Findings field/To define marker inflammation EIB possible difference asthmatic non-asthmatic child with/without EIB . Effects/The goal project define prevalence inflammatory background exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) school child determine individual environmental risk factor EIB . The obtained result provide objective measure biological process lead bronchoconstriction exercise , might experience naturally school life . The result could apply management EIB patient without asthma . The result plan research publish journal national international impact , present symposium conference .</detailed_description>
