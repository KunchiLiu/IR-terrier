	<criteria>Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol . Written inform consent obtain subject . A male female age 18 year old ( reach age legal consent ) time study entry ( i.e. , informed consent sign ) . Subject diagnose one solid tumour ( define solid malignancy , i.e. , blood element malignancy ) . Subject receive receive cytotoxic immunosuppressive chemotherapy ( study vaccine administer late start second cycle chemotherapy ) . Life expectancy great one year . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study : Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause ; Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series . Subjects receive new , targeted therapy take together classical chemotherapy . Chronic administration and/or plan administration systemic glucocorticoid within one month prior first vaccine dose Visit 3 ( Month 2 ) . Inhaled , intraarticularly inject , topical steroid allow . Previous vaccination HZ varicella within 12 month precede first dose study vaccine/ placebo . Planned administration study HZ vaccine ( include investigational nonregistered vaccine ) study vaccine . Previous chemotherapy course le one month first study vaccination . Occurrence varicella HZ episode clinical history within 12 month precede first dose study vaccine/ placebo . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine study material equipment . Administration plan administration live vaccine period start 30 day first dose study vaccine end 30 day last dose study vaccine , , administration plan administration nonreplicating vaccine within 8 day prior within 14 day either dose study vaccine . HIV infection clinical history . Acute disease and/or fever time vaccination . Acute disease define presence moderate severe illness without fever , exclude underlying malignancy , well expect symptoms/signs associated disease treatment : Fever define temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F oral , axillary tympanic setting , ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F rectal setting . The preferred route record temperature study oral . Subjects minor illness ( mild diarrhoea , mild upper respiratory infection ) without fever , may receive first dose study vaccine/ placebo discretion investigator . Any condition , judgment investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution ( childbearing potential ) Month 3 ( i.e. , 2 month last dose study vaccine/ placebo ) .</criteria>
