	<brief_summary>Virtual environment information communication technology ( ICT ) offer large perspective field assistive care rehabilitation . As potentially endless , scenarios environment use use 3D provide immersive social interactive context enjoyable therapeutic exercise age population . In addition also possible use type serious game scenario easy use device lap top tablet . Social exclusion many cause , Apathy one common behavioural disturbance find old adult population alters significantly social emotional interaction .

Apathy along nosological characteristic dementia induces impairment autonomy level therefore dependence cognitive impairment worsen . The importance stimulation could relate concept engagement define act occupy involved external stimulus . Engaging old person without Alzheimer 's disease relate disorder appropriate activity show yield beneficial HRQL effect increase positive emotion , improve cognition , functional autonomy quality life . Accordingly , enrich environment high definition virtual representation city activity interest potential encourage patient get active safe interactive environment also create access enjoyable stimulating setting severe patient . The VR set VERVE propose personalise populated environment available two different , interlinked hardware platform : 1/ : standard game set-up home , nursing home day hospital therapy group ; 2/ mobile track internet device ( e.g. , IPad ) .
