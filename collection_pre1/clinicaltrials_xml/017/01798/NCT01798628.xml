	<brief_title>A Study Determine Effect Food Pharmacokinetics Abiraterone Acetate Healthy Male Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) , randomize ( treatment sequence assign chance ) study single dose abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administer orally ( mouth ) approximately 36 healthy male participant fast fed condition . Three dose abiraterone acetate administer 7-day washout period dose . The total study duration participant 21 day . Participants randomize one six treatment sequence ( ABC , ACB , BAC , BCA , CAB , CBA ) : Treatment A = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administer high-fat meal ; Treatment B = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administer low-fat meal ; Treatment C = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administer fasted state . No food ingest 4 hour post-dose . Participants confine clinical research unit day prior dose clinic discharge day follow dose treatment period . Serial pharmacokinetic sample collect safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
