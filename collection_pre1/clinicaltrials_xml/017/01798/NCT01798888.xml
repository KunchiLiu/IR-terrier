	<brief_summary>Background : - Current treatment alcoholism limited success . More half people alcoholism return uncontrolled drinking even treatment self-help program . One possible treatment use deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . DBS study ventral capsule/ventral striatum , region brain , reduce craving alcohol small group alcoholic . DBS approve treat disorder , Parkinson disease , treat alcoholism . Researchers want study whether DBS use treat chronic alcoholism . Objectives : - To see deep brain stimulation helpful safe people chronic alcoholism . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 60 year age diagnose chronic alcoholism . - Participants must try 10 year stop drinking alcohol , fail multiple treatment self-help program . They may current substance abuse dependence problem ( except alcohol nicotine ) . Design : - Participants start study enter separate alcohol detoxification study National Institutes Health . They monitor study blood test brain scan . - Participants 2 week baseline test . They include physical exam blood urine test . They also include test think memory , question current mood . - Participants surgery insert DBS device . Electrodes place brain battery pack place chest . Participants recover surgery continue alcohol detoxification program . - About 4 week surgery , participant separate two group . For one group , DBS device turn electrical stimulation participant monitor additional two week hospital find right set device . For second group , participant receive mock stimulation , real electrical DBS , also monitor additional two week hospital . - Participants return home 24 week . During time frequent study visit look DBS device . These visit include question mood memory , well image study . - All participant return additional two week inpatient stay hospital . Those participant initially receive mock stimulation device turn real electrical stimulation monitor two week find right setting device . Those participant initially receive real stimulation continue receive stimulation monitor two week . - Participants return home another 24 . All participant point actual electrical DBS . Participants continue frequent study visit year look DBS device . These visit also include question mood level alcohol craving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The purpose pilot clinical study test safety efficacy deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) nucleus accumbens , ventral striatum ventral capsule patient treatment-resistant alcoholism provide critical information planning subsequent clinical trial , include additional experience safety procedure . Study Population Ten patient 21 60 year age severe , treatment-resistant alcoholism enrol study . Design This study randomize , sham-controlled trial open-label extension explore use DBS nucleus accumbens , ventral striatum , ventral capsule ten healthy alcohol dependent men woman fail repeated alcoholism treatment . Neurosurgical implantation DBS nucleus accumbens , ventral striatum ventral capsule perform . Following surgery prior initiation titration phase , baseline cognitive behavioral testing perform . Approximately four week follow placement electrode , randomize , sham-controlled trial open-label extension institute whereby participant randomize blind undergo either titration two week follow 24 week DBS system ON , titration follow 24 week DBS system OFF . After 24 week DBS ON OFF , open-label extension phase occur . All participant readmitted hospital second two-week titration period . The cognitive behavioral assessment perform baseline repeat . Following inpatient titration phase , discharge hospital follow outpatient clinic 24 week DBS ON . Cognitive behavioral assessment perform baseline repeat end 24-week period . Participants follow monthly time 9 month , total approximately 24 month active enrollment . Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measures : Safety : Risks associate DBS alcoholism Efficacy : Alcohol consumption measure Alcohol Timeline Followback ( TLFB ) . Secondary Outcome Measures : Secondary outcome measure include : 1 ) change processing reward punishment measure decision-making task , 3 ) change mood measure Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale ( CPRS ) , 4 ) change participation social , physical , rehabilitative activity measure Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 ( MPAI-4 ) , 5 ) change overall life satisfaction measure Satisfaction Life Scale ( SWLS ) , 6 ) change alcohol craving measure Penn Alcohol Craving Scale ( PACS ) , ( 7 ) number alcohol relapse time alcohol relapse .</detailed_description>
