	<detailed_description>Preliminary signal clinical activity ganetespib single agent observe patient advanced NSCLC . A Phase 2b/3 Study ( 9090-08 ) initiate evaluate safety activity ganetespib combination docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone NSCLC . Study 9090-08 ongoing . Results interim analysis show combination well tolerate encouraging improvement efficacy , include overall survival ( OS ) observe . Update : An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC ) establish review accumulate unblinded safety data , efficacy data two specify Interim Analyses . The DMC monitor conduct trial ( include accrual/retention patient ) review risks benefit . The study stop first Interim Analysis due futility . The efficacy portion report base 05 October 2015 data cut number protocol-defined death event ( 336 ) first interim analysis achieve . The safety portion base final database lock 23 December 2015 .</detailed_description>
