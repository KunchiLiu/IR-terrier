	<brief_title>A Randomized Cross-over Study Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus ( NPH ) cause memory loss , walk , urinary difficulty . If NPH go unidentified untreated cause severe disability . The cause disease poorly understood . It may involve damage cause impaired blood flow brain . The standard method diagnose patient symptom NPH less accurate desire . Many time patient remain undiagnosed untreated others receive treatment due false-positive diagnosis . To treat NPH , small tube call 'shunt ' surgically place brain drain cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) help relieve symptom . Currently , report response rate shunt vary 31 % 89 % . Follow-up study show shunt may work long-term . This could due natural history disease , development disease , due short term 'placebo effect ' follow shunt placement surgery . Our group study patient NPH . All participant study shunt place . These shunt programmable , place , may open close doctor . Programming shunt require additional surgical procedure . All study participant divide two group . One group shunt open drain . The group shunt close ( drain ) . After 6 week , group switch . Those open shunt close , group close , non-draining shunt , open . Participants know shunt open ( drain ) close ( drain ) . Study participant follow two year . Any participant develop recurrent , new worsen symptom take study treat accord good medical practice . The purpose study ( ) look symptom improvement response drain shunt compare non-draining shunt ( placebo affect ) , ( b ) find 'predictors ' help doctor identify patient respond well shunt placement , ( c ) monitor long-term effect shunt , ( ) ass current diagnostic testing see method accurate . Eligibility Criteria : Inclusion Criteria 1 . Age Patients ( 60 85 year old ) . 2 . Clinically suspected Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus ( iNPH ) least gait impairment . 3 . Informed consent patient . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Etiology hydrocephalus iNPH . 2 . Patients capable provide informed consent . 3 . History intra-cerebral hemorrhage . 4 . Cardiac Pacemaker .</detailed_description>
