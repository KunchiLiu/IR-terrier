	<brief_summary>The study aim use cardiac MRI scan analysis technique evaluate difference cardiac function 12 month pace patient pace lead place different position within right ventricle ( apically septally ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Septal Vs Apical Pacing Right Left Ventricular Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prolonged pace right ventricular ( RV ) Apex show associated progressive leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction . This led interest alternative right ventricular pace site . Only study investigate effect alternative right ventricular pace site use three dimensional imaging . Using cardiac MRI volumetric left- right ventricular analysis three-dimensional reconstruction accurate compare trans-thoracic echocardiogram . St. Jude Medical develop MRI conditional pacemaker system enable first time investigate alternative pacing site use cardiac MRI . Patients already implant MRI conditional pacemaker system St. Jude Medical enrol study subdivide 4 group ( right ventricular pace lead position apically septally subdivided patient pace &lt; 50 % time 50 % ) . All patient undergo cardiac MRI enrollment 12 month later . Patients pace &lt; 50 % time undergo cardiac MRI without pacemaker stimulation visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have implant Accent MRI pacemaker Tendril MRI lead . Have RV lead implant apically ( group A ) septally ( Group B ) Are RV pace &lt; 50 % time ( group A2 B2 ) Are RV pace &gt; 50 % time ( Groups A1 B1 ) Are â‰¥ 18 year age . Are able provide write informed consent . Are willing able comply prescribe followup test schedule evaluation . Have permanent atrial fibrillation preserve intrinsic conduction Have nonMRI compatible device material implant ( e.g. , intracranial aneurysm clip , nonMRI compatible device material , metal alloy , etc. ) . Have lead extender , plug adaptor . Do RV lead implant apically septally . Are eligible group A1 B1 appropriate group already 20 patient enrol . Are eligible group A2 B2 appropriate group already 5 patient enrol Are currently participate another device drug investigation include active treatment arm . Are pregnant plan become pregnant duration study . Have life expectancy le 12 month Screening due lifethreatening condition . Are contraindicated MRI scan due reason .</criteria>
