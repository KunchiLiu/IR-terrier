	<brief_summary>A new bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical drug , call Radium-223 dichloride ( formerly know `` Alpharadin '' ) , currently development . It injectable aqueous solution contain radium-223 , radionuclide emit radiation another quality different distribution radiopharmaceutical currently use . After injection drug blood , large portion drug accumulate bone , irradiate skeletal metastasis . The drug expect retain longer painful site bone sit body , may alleviate pain radiation . Radium-223 expect efficacious regard target localised irradiation , also favourable safety profile . The radiopharmaceutical drug Radium-223 give human . In first clinical study man , so-called phase I study , safety , tolerance toxicity various radioactivity dose Radium-223 evaluate .</brief_summary>
