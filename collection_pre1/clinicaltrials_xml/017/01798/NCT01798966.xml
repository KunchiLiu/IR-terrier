	<brief_summary>Patients Thyroid Eye Disease ( TED ) often enlarge extraocular muscle higher orbital fat content due disease process . The confined space orbit hold enlarge orbital content create forward displacement and/or compression globe rise intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Many patient undergo surgical decompression , procedure fracture orbital bone , order allow space enlarge orbital content occupy . To date , data show intraocular pattern 24-hour period patient mechanical compression globe TED . It know pattern IOP consistent normal IOP pattern , glaucomatous pattern , perhaps completely different either . The goal project investigate pattern IOP patient require orbital decompression orbital congestion . Changes IOP 24-hour period study contact-lens embed sensor provide continuous data . This device previously investigate show safe well-tolerated . Monitoring pattern patient allow u compare Thyroid TED pattern IOP normal glaucomatous patient . Also , test patient orbital decompression surgery allow characterization intraocular pressure change mechanical compression globe relieve .</brief_summary>
