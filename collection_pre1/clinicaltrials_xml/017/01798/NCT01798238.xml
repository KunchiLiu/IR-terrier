	<brief_title>Teneligliptin ( MP-513 ) Versus Placebo Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Although many different oral antidiabetic agent currently available , approximately 50 % treat Type 2 diabetic subject reach currently accept goal HbA1c ( Oral communication , American Diabetic Association , 2008 ) Subjects frequently prescribe agent cause hypoglycemia , and/or weight gain . - In many country , commonly prescribe primary oral diabetes drug cause hypoglycemia weight gain , metformin , metformin cause gastrointestinal adverse drug reaction , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , abdominal pain loss appetite symptom , rare life-threatening lactic acidosis . - This decrease Power Hydrogen Ions blood ( &lt; 7.25 ) increase blood lactate ( &gt; 5 mmol / L ) associate reduced kidney failure kidney impairment , decrease metformin clearance thus accumulate metformin may occur lactic acidosis frequently . Also inconvenience , adjust metformin dose depend patient 's condition . - MP-513 expect safely used treatment type 2 diabetes risk hypoglycemia and/or weight gain report pre-existing diabetes therapy inconvenience relate dose adjustment depend patient 's condition , case fatal side effect . - Furthermore inhibitory effect Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV strong half-life longer compare dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor non-clinical trial , blood glucose moderating effect prove clinically significant clinical trial conduct Europe Japan development therapeutic agent patient type 2 diabetes consider promising . - Based previous study , objective study investigate efficacy safety subject type 2 diabetes mellitus adequately control exercise diet .</detailed_description>
