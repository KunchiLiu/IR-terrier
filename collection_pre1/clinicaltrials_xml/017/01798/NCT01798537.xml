	<detailed_description>Simplified Selective Digestive Tract Decontamination prevention ICU infection set high-level antibiotic resistance Scientific Background : Aerobic gram-negative bacillus ( AGNB ) , Gram-positive bacteria fungi responsible hospital acquire infection . This problem especially typical intensive care unit ( ICUs ) due complexity disease wide use invasive procedure . The common use empiric wide-range antibiotic therapy lead development significant resistance pathogen group bacteria define Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms ( MDRO ) . Among bacteria important virulent : Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae ( CRE ) , Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases ( ESBL ) , Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) , Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci ( VRE ) well Fluconazol resistant Candida . The main reservoir organism intestinal tract , raise possibility primary eradication may lead control MDRO epidemic . Selective Digestive tract Decontamination ( SDD ) study extensively last 10-15 year body evidence show method reduce acquire infection , bacterial drug resistance mortality various ICU setting . It point however many study perform unit low prevalence infection MDROs never perform unit CREs endemic . According described protocol , SDD perform combination oral antibiotic paste - Selective Oropharyngeal Decontamination ( SOD ) together enteral medication give gastric feeding tube , well day prophylactic intra-venous treatment early generation cephalosporin . This treatment method become standard care - mostly due concern new resistance develop prescribe enteral antibiotic , rise prevalence enteral infection VRE , Clostridium difficile MRSA acquire infection . Despite evidence SDD treatment period actually reduction drug resistance , Center Disease Control prevention ( CDC ) protocols survive sepsis campaign recommend SDD mean cop MDRO epidemic . In publish SDD protocol use wide-spectrum antibiotic cover range gram-positive , gram-negative bacteria fungi , without correlation result primary screening patient . Even though approach lead rise bacterial resistance , raise enough anxiety resistance within caregiver prevent penetration daily use . The endemic spread CRE infection Rambam Medical Center lead u focus pathogen SDD program , perform rigorous bi-weekly screening bacteria . We give enteral antibiotic treatment ( Neomycin + Polymixin E ) target AGNB , primary screening find MRSA Fungi , prescribe enteral preventive treatment ( Vancomycin Nystatin ) . Therefore , prospective study perform 2011 Rambam department critical care medicine , influence simplify SDD protocol acquisition AGNB infection ICU . The result show significant reduction blood stream infection change epidemiology colonization respiratory tract - resistant sensitive bacteria . There concomitant reduction use MDRO- target antibiotic . The propose multi-center study base successful experience focus influence simplify SDD protocol colonization infection MDROs israeli ICUs CREs endemic .</detailed_description>
