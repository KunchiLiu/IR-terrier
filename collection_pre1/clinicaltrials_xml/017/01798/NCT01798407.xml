	<brief_summary>This research study investigate safety , tolerability , benefit bilateral deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) lateral habenula patient treatment-resistant major depression ( TRD ) secondary either nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , bipolar disorder ( BD ) I . Six adult patient TRD treat single-site study Baylor College Medicine ; patient chronically symptomatic significant functional disability , demonstrate resistance standard somatic pharmacotherapeutic treatment . The primary outcome measure change 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS17 ) six month commencement stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study include follow part : 1. medical psychiatric evaluation , 2. implantation brain stimulation system , 3. follow include program psychiatric test implantation 1 . Medical psychiatric evaluation : During part study , investigator ask detailed question patient 's psychiatric medical history , ask list medication along response previous treatment . As part medical evaluation , patient ask give sample blood urine standard lab evaluation . All patient test presence drug abuse urine . All woman child bear potential also test pregnancy . If test result positive , patient continue part study , receive clinical care treat psychiatrist . 2 . Implantation brain stimulation system : Description Medical Devices The brain stimulation system implant inside patient 's body . The implanted system make three major part : - The lead make four insulated wire four electrode end . - The extension connect lead neurostimulator ( power source ) . - The neurostimulator ( battery ) power source system . The neurostimulator metal `` '' , depend model patient receives , range 2 3 inch diameter ½ inch thick . It contain small battery produce electrical impulse need stimulation . For study rechargeable battery use . Although battery life varies patient depend type intensity stimulation need good symptom relief , use rechargeable battery extend time must replace . Patients two neurostimulators implant , . The surgeon may place neurostimulators either near collarbone , within abdomen , need allow proper distance neurostimulators . Patients admit hospital either night morning surgery . The day surgery , follow step may occur : 1 . A metal frame attach head . The frame special instrument allow surgeon find correct path target site brain . Local anesthetic give pin , hold frame head , hurt . 2 . Pictures brain take use MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) and/or computer-aided tomography ( CAT ) scan . This allow surgeon determine area brain lead place . 3 . The patient go operate room two small hole drill skull , one lead implant . The patient receive local anesthesia procedure . 4 . The lead pass brain desire site . 5 . A cap place hole skull . The cap also hold lead position . 6 . The metal frame remove patient 's head . If extension neurostimulator implant right away , patient typically allow go home approximately 24-48 hour . The study doctor decide length patient 's hospital stay . 7 . The extension neurostimulator may place one two week lead implant . If , outpatient procedure perform general anesthesia ( ie patient asleep ) . Patients discharge home day determine stable condition . 3 ) Follow-up program psychiatric assessment The study physician want see patient follow surgery . Follow visit schedule patient implanted . During visit , study physician clinician assess patient 's condition use various standardized questionnaire . Frequent , non-invasive adjustment stimulation parameter may require achieve optimal symptom response . This adjustment period may take week month . 4 ) Duration treatment The optimization period generally last 6 month , modulation appointment schedule monthly need basis . If patient responds treatment , treatment may temporarily discontinue month 12 18 find response treatment . The patient tell discontinuation occur carefully monitored time . If symptoms worsen , patient inform treatment discontinue , option treatment restart . If patient continue well without stimulation , may offer opportunity continue without stimulation , consider remove device , restart stimulation . Because battery life approximately 7-9 year , every 7-9 year battery need replace . This require patient undergo brief surgery neurostimulator replace - neurostimulator contain small rechargeable battery produce electrical impulse need stimulation . When battery longer recharge , neurostimulator must replace . Once patient exit study , insurance may pay device replacement medical care relate device .</detailed_description>
