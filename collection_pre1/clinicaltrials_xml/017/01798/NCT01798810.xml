	<brief_title>Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen Reduce Surgical Site Infection After High Energy Fracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To compare proportion surgical site infection within 6 month patient treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compare treat without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . Secondary Objectives To compare specie antibacterial sensitivity bacteria patient develop surgical site infection study patient treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compare treat without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . To validate previously develop risk prediction model development surgical site infection fracture surgery To measure compare resource utilization cost associate surgical site infection study patient treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compare treat without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . Primary Aim : To compare proportion surgical site infection within 6 month patient treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compare treat without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . Hypothesis 1 : The proportion surgical site infection low patient treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . Secondary Aim # 1 : Compare bacterial specie antimicrobial susceptibility patient develop surgical site infection study patient treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compare treat without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . Hypothesis 2 : In patient develop infection , bacterial specie antimicrobial susceptibility profile treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen similar treat without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . Secondary Aim # 2 : To validate previously develop risk prediction model development surgical site infection fracture surgery . Hypothesis 3 : The previously develop RIOTS score highly predictive infection risk . Secondary Aim # 3 : Measure compare resource utilization cost associate surgical site infection study patient treat Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compare treat without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen . Hypothesis 4 : Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen associate low resource utilization cost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All `` high energy '' tibial plateau fracture treat operatively plate screw fixation . We define `` high energy '' tibial plateau fracture patient either : Initially treat external fixation treat 7 day later swell resolve . Gustilo Type I , II , IIIA open fracture , regardless time definitive treatment . All `` high energy '' pilon ( distal tibial plafond ) fracture treat operatively plate screw fixation . We define `` high energy '' tibial plateau fracture patient either : Initially treat external fixation ( without fibula fixation limit internal fixation ) treat definitively 7 day later swell resolve . Gustilo Type I , II , IIIA open fracture , regardless time definitive treatment . All `` high energy '' calcaneus fracture treat operatively plate screw fixation stag fashion . We define `` high energy '' calcaneus fracture patient either : Treated definitively 7 day later swell resolve . Gustilo Type Type I , II , IIIA [ 30,31 ] open fracture , regardless time definitive treatment . Ages 18 80 year Patients may coexist infection study fracture site , without antibiotic treatment . Patients may risk factor infection include diabetes , immunosuppression steroid medication , HIV , infection . Patients may head injury . Patients may treat initially temporary external fixator prior randomization . Patients may portion fixation ( e.g . fibula fixation pilon percutaneous screw across tibial plateau fracture ) prior definitive plate fixation , initial surgery randomization definitive fixation . Patients may orthopedic nonorthopaedic injury . Patients may preexist musculoskeletal injury , non ambulators , spinal cord injury . Tibial plateau , pilon , calcaneus already infected time study enrollment . Type IIIB , IIIC open [ 30,31 ] fracture Patient speak neither English Spanish . Transfer patient already definitive fixation . Severe problem maintain followup ( e.g . patient homeless time injury intellectually challenge without adequate family support ) . Patients intubated time consent . Patients whose oxygen requirement time surgery would prevent participate either study group exclude . History COPD chronic respiratory disease render patient oxygen dependent baseline . Current history Bleomycin use ( chemotherapy use associate oxygen toxicity ) . Patient currently pregnant .</criteria>
