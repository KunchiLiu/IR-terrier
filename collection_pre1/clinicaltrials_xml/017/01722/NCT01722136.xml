	<detailed_description>The overall goal determine whether energy expenditure compensation response 16 week aerobic exercise higher-dose great compare lower-dose intervention old woman , begin investigate underlying physiological mechanism influence energy expenditure change old woman . Changes component energy expenditure , well concentration plasma leptin serum free T3 , response two different exercise program ( 14 8 kcal/kg body weight weekly , 60-65 % VO2max , 4 days/wk ) compare old , non-obese woman ( 60-75 yr , BMI=18-30 kg/m2 ) . Specific Aim 1 : To determine whether differential change total daily energy expenditure component occur old woman response two exercise program different dos . State-of-the-art method use ( total daily energy expenditure doubly label water ; non-exercise activity thermogenesis use Physical Activity Monitoring System ; rest metabolic rate thermic effect food via indirect calorimetry ) . Primary Hypothesis : Due great decline NEAT , woman exhibit small increase total daily energy expenditure response higher-dose , compare lower-dose , exercise program , despite great increase rest metabolic rate thermic effect food . Specific Aim 2 : To explore whether differential change occur plasma leptin serum free triiodo-L-thyronine ( free T3 ) concentration old woman response 16-week aerobic exercise program two different dos . We hypothesize response higher-dose exercise program , woman exhibit large decrease plasma leptin serum free T3 concentration , compare lower-dose exercise program . We also determine whether woman exhibit great improvement plasma lipid , insulin sensitivity ( use homeostasis model assessment , HOMA , score ) , blood pressure , aerobic fitness response higher-dose , compare lower-dose , exercise program .</detailed_description>
