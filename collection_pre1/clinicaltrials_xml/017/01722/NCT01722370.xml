	<brief_summary>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) may develop low oxygen level , damage lung . Long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) give least 15 hour per day , establish indication benefit COPD . However , indication benefit ambulatory oxygen supplementation ( oxygen walk exercise ) less well understood , part due heterogeneity previous study design , lack long term follow . This pilot study supplementary ambulatory oxygen COPD , allow u ascertain mechanisms disease measure degree systemic inflammation pre post oxygen supplementation , measure change gene expression muscle mean microarray profile . Secondly , study utilise follow clinical parameter include home activity monitoring ascertain medium/long term benefit oxygen supplementation real life set . Our hypothesis exertional hypoxia result muscle dysfunction could prevent oxygenation .</brief_summary>
