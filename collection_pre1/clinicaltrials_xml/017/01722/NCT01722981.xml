	<brief_title>Percutaneous Tracheostomy - Systematic Comparison Among Three Methods : Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous tracheostomy routinely perform intensive care unit world number indication , : airway obstruction , need long respiratory support , improvement respiratory toilet , prophylaxis head neck procedures case severe obstructive sleep apnea . Several study show procedure safe economically efficient comparison open surgical operation operate room . In many place around world customary perform operation guidance bronchoscope prevent damage adjacent structure , high low position tube , damage posterior wall trachea approve final position tube . However , use bronchoscope depend availability equipment , knowledge operator , temporary occlusion trachea hypercarbia , increase length procedure , maintenance cost ( disinfection , replacement , etc. ) . Ultrasound perform percutaneous procedure may useful prevent damage para tracheal adjacent structure , prevent high placement tube . The use duplex sonography real-time visualization needle path do routinely procedures central venous catheterization , may improve safety accuracy percutaneous tracheostomy without cause airway obstruction hypercarbia . Feasibility procedure review article Rajajee et al . In institution number institution country , acceptable perform operation place tube high position near vocal cord direct laryngoscopy puncture trachea needle , location anatomy palpation neck . So far , systematic comparison make among three method .</detailed_description>
