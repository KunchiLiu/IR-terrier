	<brief_summary>You invite participate research study develop new way look abnormal areas/tissues colon . The current endoscope use look colon good , area n't look different naked eye , endoscope ca n't improve . We look use special fluorescent stain addition special endoscope design see abnormal area obvious naked eye . Currently specialize microscope fluorescent stain use clinical laboratory take several day process get result . It may helpful look area sample abnormal tissue endoscopy procedure . You ask let u spray `` fluorescent peptide '' right colon . Peptides small chain amino acid ( build block make protein ) link together . Our peptide chain 7 amino acid attach fluorescent dye call FITC ( like one use eye doctor ) . We prepare special `` fluorescent peptide '' target bind abnormal area present , `` glow '' special light use . In study , apply special fluorescent peptide spray catheter right colon ass safety . The colonoscope use study usual colonoscope use able see fluorescence . This phase 1 study . This mean first time use kind `` fluorescent peptide '' people . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve agent , allow u test study . The goal study see side effect use peptide . We use similar peptide 've develop esophagus 40 patient without side effect . This first test agent , wo n't use change colonoscopy do .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal research develop use fluorescence-labeled peptide ( Colon KCC ) affinity bind pre-cancerous mucosa digestive tract use image agent aid early detection colon cancer . Currently colon cancer prevention achieve endoscopic evaluation removal pre-malignant lesion ( adenomatous polyp ) endoscopic resection biopsy . Standard endoscopy use white light illumination able detect pre-cancerous tissue abnormal architectural feature , polyp mass . However , pre-cancerous lesion also flat appearance visually indistinct normal tissue ; case chronic ulcerative colitis / right-sided polyp . Furthermore , flat depressed lesion , difficult detect white light colonoscopy , may represent 25 % pre-malignant lesion may confer high risk malignancy . Integration molecular probe home diseased tissue high resolution image instrument could greatly improve diagnostic accuracy miss lesion polypoid non-polypoid morphology , include often fatal 'right-sided ' adenoma . Endoscopic image use fluorescent-labeled probe promise method achieve great specificity , spatial localization high image contrast detection neoplastic lesion . This study 'first-in-humans ' test safety topically apply peptide . A Phase I study safety topically-administered fluorescent heptapeptide detect neoplastic area colon propose . The study test safety administer agent human subject undergo clinically-indicated colonoscopy . Safety define occurrence adverse event administration topical fluorescence-labeled peptide surface intra-colonic mucosa .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The inclusion criterion propose clinical study : Subjects schedule outpatient colonoscopy . All subject medically clear procedure ( e.g . washout anticoagulant , comorbidities ) meet inclusion/exclusion include . Standard practice guideline safely proceed procedure sufficient study Adults age 18 year 100 Willing able sign inform consent Willing able get repeat clinical lab The effect Colon KCC Heptapeptide ( label 5FITC ) develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test day procedure receive Colon KCC Heptapeptide ( 5FITClabeled peptide ) agent postmenopausal . Postmenopausal woman define posthysterectomy , 40 least 18 month without menses birthcontrol . The exclusion criterion propose clinical study : Subjects know allergy negative reaction fluorescein derivative . Subjects active chemotherapy radiation treatment</criteria>
