	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) second leading cause cancer death United States . About 90 % CRC related death due metastatic spreadâ€”mostly liver lung . With adequate multidisciplinary patient selection , CRC liver lung metastasectomy significantly improve survival offer best chance cure . However , patient limit lung liver metastases clinically underserved poorly scientifically study . The individual indication resection decision make adjuvant systemic therapy remain challenge . More sensitive technique detect occult disease need metastatic CRC ( mCRC ) patient , perioperative analysis circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) may provide outstanding opportunity develop innovative method . We hypothesize CTCs enrich CRC liver and/or lung metastasectomy , isolate characterized attempt identify novel therapeutic target . CTCs believe cause metastasis may provide non-invasive alternative organ biopsy detection , characterization monitoring solid cancer . CTC number show strong predictor Progression Free Survival Overall Survival mCRC patient . The CellSearch system ( Veridex LLC , Ratinas , NJ , USA ) currently FDA approve test evaluation CTC number metastatic breast , prostate colorectal cancer . However , rarity CTCs blood lead limit capture efficiency CellSearch system fix cell , prevent molecular characterization CTCs functional assay primary cell culture . In protocol CellSearch system compare new technology , call Flexible Micro Spring Array ( FMSA ) device , develop Dr. Zheng , Department Bioengineering , Penn State University , University Park . This novel approach enable size-exclusion base filtration viable CTC enrichment . The FMSA device inexpensive , work rapidly , retain viable CTCs biological study . Using CellSearch system FMSA device , determine kinetics CTC shed circulation , develop effective system isolation , enumeration , enrichment CTCs , use system find characteristic different CTC population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More sensitive technique detect occult disease need metastatic CRC ( mCRC ) patient , perioperative analysis circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) may provide outstanding opportunity develop innovative method . Determine kinetics CTC shed circulation : Perioperative CTC detection potential explain CTCs shed blood . Findings could explain nature CTCs important impact understanding metastatic spread relevant clinical application . Since protocol include blood draw multiple time point different distance metastasis , result could clarify rarity absence CTCs peripheral blood mCRC patient explain dilution . Comparison patient CRC liver lung metastasis might help explain different pattern organ spread . Results study could establish CTCs prognostic biomarker identify candidate benefit metastasectomy candidate additional palliative systemic treatment high risk later recurrence . - Develop effective system isolation , enumeration , enrichment characterization live CTCs : One current issue CTC analysis enrichment rare cell blood . We plan analyze perioperatively draw blood use flexible micro spring array ( FMSA ) device . The FMSA mitigate stress experience CTCs isolation blood enables viable capture . The geometric design filtration pressure optimize maximize capture efficiency , enrichment leukocyte , tumor cell viability . Peripheral blood well blood direct tumor environment ( take OR suction system ) analyze compare sensitivity FMSA CellSearch device . Since FMSA allow isolation live CTCs , process single cell characterization . - Find characteristic different CTC population : We hypothesize CTCs enrich cancer stem cell marker well marker poor prognosis aggressive tumor growth . Our novel approach screen quantify panel biomarkers simultaneously analysis CTC marker utilize CellSearch system analyze CTCs unique . We view assays potential `` liquid biopsy '' screen marker prognosis , sensitivity chemotherapy , response therapy , well proteins involve proliferation , apoptosis , immune response . Furthermore , plan perform single cell analysis gene mutation gene expression . Next generation genomic sequence single CTCs may allow u determine genetic signature colorectal CTCs identify novel biomarkers CTC detection , disease monitoring , therapeutic efficacy . Furthermore , extent heterogeneity among initially isolate CTCs , compare primary tumor CTCs grow vitro , study . Single CTC analysis potential identify novel gene signal transduction pathway activate CTCs compare genomic profile primary tumor patient metastasis . Single cell genomic analysis CTCs highly innovative provide important information disease monitoring well shed light underlie biology CTCs .</detailed_description>
