	<brief_title>Trial Effect Adalimumab Vascular Inflammation Patients With Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients moderate severe psoriasis include multicenter , double-blind , placebo control study . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) Day 0 receive either adalimumab placebo . Adalimumab administer sub-cutaneously described Canadian product monograph ( 80mg follow 40mg Week 1 40mg every week ) . At Week 16 , patient receive two injection blind study product . Patients randomized placebo group receive two injection adalimumab ( 2 x 40 mg ) patient randomize adalimumab receive two injection placebo . As Week 17 , patient randomize placebo group receive 40 mg adalimumab every week Week 67 . Patients randomized adalimumab group continue receive adalimumab 40mg every week Week 51 . Efficacy assess 18-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) scan carotid MRI baseline , Week 16 Week 52 ( Week 68 patient randomized placebo ) . Safety assess physical examination , vital sign , adverse event collection , routine laboratory examination , pregnancy test , hepatitis B C serology ( screen ) , Purified Protein Derivative ( PPD ) Quantiferon Gold ( screen ) Chest X-Ray ( CXR ) ( screen ) .</detailed_description>
