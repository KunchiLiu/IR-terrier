	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) pomalidomide combination dexamethasone patient relapsed/refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) primary vitreoretinal lymphoma ( PVRL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ( overall response rate ) safety pomalidomide combination dexamethasone patient PCNSL PVRL lymphoma MTD expand cohort . II . To evaluate overall survival progression free survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study pharmacokinetics pomalidomide central nervous system . II . To identify predictive biomarkers responsiveness pomalidomide . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pomalidomide . Patients receive pomalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 2 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
