	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) affect 16 % adult population associate significant morbidity mortality . People high risk progressive CKD define sustained decline estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) and/or presence significant albuminuria/proteinuria . Accurate map bio-clinical determinant group enable improve risk stratification direct development well target management people CKD . To address requirement establish Renal Impairment Secondary Care ( RIISC ) study ; RIISC enrol cohort patient high risk progressive CKD compile comprehensive detailed bio-clinical phenotype , include vascular oral health phenotyping , enrolment subsequent follow-up .</brief_summary>
