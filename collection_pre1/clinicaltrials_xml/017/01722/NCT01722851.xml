	<brief_summary>To identify panel circulate miRNA marker could help identify breast cancer patient likely respond well neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy , indeed serve overall prognostic factor stratify patient risk category would guide management . Similarly , investigator aim identify panel circulate miRNA marker could monitor patient 's response chemotherapy hormonal therapy . Ideally suitable panel marker would show significant change expression level good-responders whilst little change would observe miRNA expression non-responders .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : 1 . To identify panel miRNAs , detectable circulation , alter breast cancer patient 2 . To identify specific combination miRNAs ( 'signatures ' ) associate breast cancer intrinsic subtypes , thereby could aid prognostication treatment plan individual patient basis . Secondary Objective : 1 . To determine systemic miRNA analysis use biomarker monitor response chemotherapy , neoadjuvant setting patient present breast cancer recurrence treat upfront chemotherapy This prospective cohort study , involve two study cohort : Cohort 1 : Newly diagnose breast cancer patient , Cohort 2 : Recurrent breast cancer patient Blood Sampling : - 1st ( baseline ) blood sample presentation commence neoadjuvant ( cohort 1 ) systemic ( cohort 2 ) treatment . - 2nd blood sample midway chemotherapy treatment ( 2nd cycle enrol 4 cycle regimen , 4th cycle prescribe 8 week regimen ) . - 3rd blood sample post-chemotherapy surgery ( applicable ) . - 4th blood sample 2-4 week surgery , last blood sample surgery envisage - 5th blood sample 12-18 month surgery 3rd blood sampling surgery envisage . GUH : Tissue sample take time biopsy and/or time surgery . All sample process miRNA quantification - panel 9 cancer-specific miRNAs measure sample , change patient 's miRNA expression level monitor course treatment . Blood sample process miRNA analysis , involve : 1 . Lysis use Trizol 2 . RNA isolation 3 . Assessing concentration integrity RNA use Nanodrop spectrophotometry 4. cDNA synthesis ( use miRNA specific stem loop primer ) 5 . PCR amplification relative quantification ( use miRNA specific probe )</detailed_description>
