	<brief_summary>Several study show stenting femoropopliteal artery lower leg lead improve overall result compare balloon angioplasty alone . However , scar tissue development occur within stent , process call restenosis . Treatment in-stent restenotic lesion high procedural success rate recurrence scar tissue frequently see . Several method propose treat in-stent restenosis lower leg artery mixed result note . In study hypothesize simultaneous tissue excision aspiration use JetStream Navitus device ( Medrad ) lead high rate acute procedural success low intraprocedural complication acceptable recurrence rate restenosis 6-month follow-up .</brief_summary>
