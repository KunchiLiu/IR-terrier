	<brief_summary>This study evaluate use intravitreal aflibercept ( anti-VEGF therapy ) patient type macular degeneration know vascularized pigment epithelial detachment . Previous study show generally poor outcome treat difficult treat form wet macular degeneration . More recently , multiple pilot study show positive benefit use anti-VEGF therapy . This study evaluate safety efficacy treat vascularize pigment epithelial detachment associate wet macular degeneration intravitreal aflibercept injection .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject ≥ 50 year age Subject willing participate study follow criterion protocol study . The study eye treatment naïve regard treatment neovascular AMD . Subject involve another clinical study currently . Subject willing follow protocol outline study . Ability understand inform consent willingness sign inform consent . Presence submacular vascularize fibrovascular PED . The investigator must search characteristic feature vascularize PED summarize : 1 . A notch irregularity associate orangeyellow round , oval , beanshaped elevation RPE smooth , convex surface see examination fundus photography ( FP ) . Fluorescein angiography ( FA ) show uniform staining PED welldefined margin , intense staining ( hotspot ) focus CNV . 2 . A fibrovascular PED occult neovascularization typically show stipple hyperfluorescence early phase increase hyperfluorescent stain leakage later phase FA variable surround margin . There may RPE fold . 3 . Regarding PED component retinal angiomatous proliferation ( RAP ) , early feature FP include intraretinal neovascularization ( IRN ) frequently adjacent small retinal hemorrhage lateral expansion irregularly stellate pattern development retinalchoroidal anastomosis eventual PED later phase . The investigator require perform indocyaninegreen ( ICG ) angiography baseline establish RAP lesion ruleout polypoidal vasculopathy lesion , since FA image may distinct . 4 . The investigator must also search feature associate PED indicate presence vascular component , i.e . hemorrhage , exudate , and/or chorioretinal fold . 5 . The investigator must confirm presence PED FA/FP OCT. Spectral Domain OCT utilized . Specifically , Spectralis OCT manufacture Heidleberg maintain uniformity site . The PED height , SA , GLD , volume measure OCT image . The characteristic OCT finding vascularize PED must confirm , include distinct elevation highly hyperreflective RPE layer mild backscatter underlie choroidal layer portion PED without CNV . For portion PED underlie CNV , typical OCT finding consist moderate hyperreflectivity contiguous overlie markedly hyperreflective detach RPE correspond CNV usually extend choroidal layer . Besides OCT characteristic confirmation must make FP/FA image vascularize PED , outline detail . Central foveal involvement PED CNV due agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) . The CNV may classic , occult , mixed , long associate PED . The CNV may within PED adjacent margin PED . PED ≤ 12 disc area size . BCVA ETDRS ≥ 19 letter ≤ 73 letter ( 20/400 20/40 ) . Evidence submacular fluid outside surround PED . Surface area submacular hemorrhage need &lt; 50 % entire PED . Submacular fibrosis need &lt; 50 % entire PED . Sufficiently clear medium ( cornea , anterior chamber , lens , vitreous ) OCT , FA FP . Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) 25mmHg less study eye , without use ocular hypotensive agent . Prior treatment neovascular AMD form neovascularization fellow eye , include antiVEGF form therapy target specifically fellow eye exclude fellow eye enrollment study . Prior focal corticosteroid treatment allow , long lack involvement study eye . However prior ( within 90 day Day 0 ) current systemic corticosteroid therapy ( oral intravenous corticosteroid treatment ) permit . Any prior treatment neovascular AMD eye propose enrollment ( nonnaïve eye ) , include previous antivascular endothelial factor ( antiVEGF ) therapy , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , radiation therapy , corticosteroid treatment , surgical treatment CNV , thermal laser treatment , prior treatment neovascular AMD . Known serious allergy aflibercept , fluorescein dye , drug pupillary dilation , topical anesthetic , sterilize solution ( e.g . Betadine Solution ) . Contraindication pupillary dilation study eye . Any condition ( include inability read visual acuity chart , language barrier ) may preclude subject ability comply study protocol requirement . Presence advance systemic condition endstage disease , advance Alzheimer Syndrome , endstage cancer , etc. , likely prevent subject completing study . Previous therapeutic radiation region study eye . Prior retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE ) tear study eye . Prior ocular surgery ( except YAG laser capsulotomy ) study within past 90 day . Anticipated ocular surgery ( except YAG laser capsulotomy ) next 12 month Prior therapy AMD ( except mineral vitamin ) , include laser . Prior vitrectomy Presence cause CNV PED due AMD . Presence substantial ocular disease ( CNV PED ) may compromise vision study eye and/or confound interpretation data ; e.g . substantial cataract , concomitant diabetic retinopathy affect macula , advance glaucoma , optic neuritis , optic neuropathy , atrophy , mark macular atrophy , ocular vascular occlusion , history retinal detachment , uveitis , viral form chorioretinitis , etc . Presence ocular disease AMD affect study eye , i.e . presume ocular histoplasmosis syndrome , android streak , pathologic myopia ( spherical equivalent ≥ 8 diopter myopia axial length ≥ 25mm ) , choroidal rupture , multifocal choroiditis , etc . Active ocular infection ( i.e. , bacterial , viral , parasitic , fungal ) either eye screen Serous PED without neovascularization polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ( PCV ) lesion exclude . Prior current systemic antiVEGF Prior ( within 90 day Day 0 ) current corticosteroid therapy ( oral intravenous corticosteroid treatment ) . Sexually active men* woman childbearing potential** unwilling practice adequate contraception study ( adequate contraception measure include , stable use oral contraceptive prescription pharmaceutical contraceptive 2 menstrual cycle prior screen ; intrauterine device [ IUD ] ; bilateral tubal ligation ; vasectomy ; condom plus contraceptive sponge , foam , jelly , diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge , foam , jelly ) *Contraception require men document vasectomy . ** Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month order consider childbearing potential . Pregnancy test contraception require woman document hysterectomy tubal ligation .</criteria>
