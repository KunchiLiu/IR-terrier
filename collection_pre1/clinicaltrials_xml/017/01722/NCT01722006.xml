	<brief_summary>Classical conditioning widely use study motivational property addictive drug animal , rarely used human . Here , establish procedure suitable study neurobiology individual determinant classical conditioning human . Healthy volunteer randomly assign four group receive methamphetamine placebo presence distinctive environmental cue pair unpaired condition . During session , subject perform task know activate ventral striatum fMRI study . The task perform presence distinctive context , consist screen background image beach mountain , accompany corresponding sound . Separate group subject carry task high low reward condition . Within two reward condition , one group ( pair ) , receive methamphetamine ( 20 mg , oral ) placebo consistently associate one context , ( unpaired ) receive drug placebo unrelated context . A fifth group ( pair ) perform task contextual cue absence monetary incentive . Before conditioning , participant carry series force choice task , change preference time analyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects assign one 5 group : Paired , high reward ( PairHi ; n=24 ) ; Paired , low reward ( PairLo ; n=24 ) ; Paired reward ( PairNone ; n=23 ) ; Unpaired , high reward ( UnpHi ; n=7 ) ; Unpaired , low-reward ( UnpLo ; n=9 ) . Each participant attend orientation session , follow four 4h conditioning session separate least 48h , 2h test session . During initial orientation session , subject practice computer task together environmental stimulus pair conditioning session , carry series choice task image ( see ) . All subject receive methamphetamine ( 20 mg ) two condition session placebo two session , administer double-blind condition . Subjects differ whether environmental stimulus consistently pair drug administration . The three pair group consistently receive drug placebo combination one two set visual auditory background stimulus ( see ) . The two unpaired group receive treatment combination one stimulus set one session , . During four conditioning session , subject perform series computer task . Depending group assignment , subject able earn high ( PairHi , UnpHi ) low monetary reward ( PairLo , UnpLo ) , contingent subject ' performance . Each run game begin credit prevent negative outcome early run . The PairNone group play game without monetary reward . The order three game background image use randomize across subject , remain constant within subject . Tasks present presence two distinctive compound stimuli consist background screen visible behind task presentation accompany correspond sound . One set stimulus depict summer beach view accompany sound ocean wave . The depicts summer alpine scenery accompany birdsong . The primary outcome measure change preference rating study stimulus , conditioning . This behavioral study , design develop novel procedure future image study .</detailed_description>
