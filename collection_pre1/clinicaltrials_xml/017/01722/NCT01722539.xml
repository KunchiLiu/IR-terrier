	<brief_summary>Considering fact : ( ) IPT malaria provide substantial protection anaemia malaria school child ( ii ) ; SP resistance significant impact prophylactic efficacy ( iii ) SP-PQ safe efficacious SP : investigator hypothesize antimalarial IPT SP SP-PQ improve haemoglobin concentration , reduce anaemia prevalence , malaria incidence parasitaemia , improve malnutrition school performance school-aged child Congo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact IPT With Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine Plus Piperaquine Schoolchildren</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY RATIONAL The education sector represent reliable system malaria control . Intermittent preventive therapy schoolchildren ( IPTsc ) likely feasible appropriate chemoprevention stable endemic area schoolchildren usually asymptomatic malaria infection consequently untreated practice . Therefore , proven effective , IPTsc would direct benefit schoolchild , contribute malaria control school , facilitate community-wide implementation control intervention i.e . vector control , Intermittent preventive therapy infant ( IPTi ) , prompt diagnosis treatment ( PDT ) . Nevertheless , evidence use IPTsc yet substantiate two clinical study far perform IPTsc hyper endemic area . Further clinical trial warrant setting . Through randomise control trial ( RCT ) ass efficacy safety , two IPT regimen versus control school child DRCongo . STUDY DRUGS Favourable drug use IPT balance long half-life efficacy , safety , tolerability potentiality cross-resistance selection . ( 16 ) Use long-acting drug would result few intake high treatment compliance . Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine establish used product indication IPT pregnancy . The drug proven safety tolerability child clinical trial . SP slowly eliminate allows 60 day antimalaria protection fully sensitive P. falciparum . Other long-acting drug available mefloquine , amodiaquine , piperaquine . However , due safety concern mefloquine might optimal IPT . Amodiaquine suitable IPT due 3 day treatment regimen may concern regard compliance . Piperaquine extensively use mass prophylaxis treatment since 1978 China malaria endemic country Asia . ( 20 ) Piperaquine long half-live point good IPT candidate endemic country SP resistance . For study sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combine piperaquine ( SP-PQ ) plus use . SP SP-PQ give 4 month interval line long half-lives ( around 20 day ) paediatric patient higher treatment compliance ,</detailed_description>
