	<brief_summary>The overall goal project develop novel family friendly intervention help teens poor metabolic control type 1 diabetes increase sustain daily self monitoring blood glucose low HbA1c . This important poor metabolic control long-term health implication . This project provide important information regard new effective way improve outcome among teen poorly control type 1 diabetes . Primary hypothesis intervention , MAxIM , : ( 1 ) help teen improve maintain glucose control , ( 2 ) improve decision making ( improve executive function reduce delay discounting ) , predict treatment outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes adolescent significant medical condition associate high economic cost increase mortality , incidence increase . Unfortunately , adolescent show poor adherence self monitor blood glucose ( SMBG ) recommendation poorer metabolic control adult . Although individual family-based intervention show promise improve metabolic control , critical need develop effective intervention . The overall goal DP3 project develop new innovative intervention target decision make help teen poor diabetic metabolic control increase frequency SMBG improve HbA1c . The target population teen age 13-17 type 1 diabetes HbA1c &gt; 8 % . Based prior work conceptual model , propose study develop pilot test novel , multifaceted , developmentally appropriate intervention aim improve adolescent decision making . An integrated set component target adolescent ' need frequent positive feedback , improved future orientation , motivational support . While past research indicate behavioral intervention frequently successful include multiple element , previous intervention combine multiple empirically-based component target key decision make lever one intervention . This new intervention , call MAxIM ( MotivAtion , Incentives , Memory ) use : 1 ) motivation enhancement therapy ( MET ) ( exist evidence-based treatment adolescent diabetes ) supplement cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) enhance behavior change ; 2 ) financial incentive daily blood glucose test parental monitoring provide frequent positive feedback ; 3 ) work memory training ( WMT ) , efficacious method strengthen specific cognitive process support decision-making future orientation . The intervention deliver family home via internet increase reach intervention family live distant treat endocrinologist . MAxIM teen parent friendly design increase engagement compliance intervention . Primary hypothesis MAxIM : ( 1 ) help teen improve maintain glucose control , ( 2 ) improve decision making ( improve executive function reduce delay discounting ) , predict treatment outcome . The unique set intervention hold promise improving adherence affect multiple basic mechanism determine poor decision making . The project develop novel , highly transportable , home base intervention design maximize sustain HbA1c reduction SMBG frequency time adolescent . Innovations include target multiple lever specific adolescent decision making , use technology deliver intervention family home , test cognitive predictor treatment outcome teens diabetes . Successful achievement study 's aim bring field closer cost effective , long-lasting intervention improve outcome among high-risk youth .</detailed_description>
