	<brief_summary>The use domiciliary non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure yield variable effect survival , quality life dyspnea .

	<brief_title>Trial Non-invasive Ventilation Stable COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) associate progressive decline lung function resultant chronic respiratory failure . This lead significant rate hospitalization , disability , death . COPD also associate sleep disorder breathe nocturnal hypoventilation , result nocturnal daytime hypoxemia hypercapnia . These , turn , contribute fatigue , dyspnea impaired quality life . Presence hypercapnia associate 33 % 5-year survival . Nocturnal NPPV theoretically rest overloaded respiratory muscle , prevent nocturnal hypoventilation , reset central respiratory drive patient hypercapnia . The use non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) late stage COPD appear logical change inexorable course , alleviate symptom improve quality life . While NPPV definite role management acute hypercapnic respiratory failure , role management late stage stable COPD controversial . Multiple study show survival benefit nocturnal NPPV chronic hypercapnic stable COPD patient . The effect quality life dyspnea score patient inconsistent . The variable efficacy might due late administration intervention course disease , presence advance hypercapnic respiratory failure . We seek assess effect apply NPPV index health-related quality life patient relative normocapnia . We hypothesize patient stable severe COPD improve quality life reduce dyspnea use NPPV .</detailed_description>
