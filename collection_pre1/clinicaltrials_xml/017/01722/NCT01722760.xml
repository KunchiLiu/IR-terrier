	<brief_summary>Children bear prematurely great risk develop chronic lung disease ( Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ) . With increase amount premature child , expect increase number child BPD . Today many way predict treat condition , child usually hospital several month birth . Many dismiss home oxygen . Children BPD typically often re-submitted hospital respiratory disease first couple year , problem throughout childhood adulthood . Other scientist find correlation BPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . The condition well treatment ( steroid ) , associate great risk adverse effect Cerebral Palsy , blindness , deafness mental retardation . The investigator wish find safe way identify child great risk develop BPD , could therefore benefit intensive treatment.An early diagnosis would increase possibility predict prognosis . Other study prove connection low vitamin A D high exhale nitrogen oxide ( NO ) lung disease . With trial investigator wish make reference material NO vitamins A D infant admit neonatal department two hospital Denmark , without treatment nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure . The investigator furthermore wish describe eventual connection BPD factor examine large group child 7 specific occasion within first two month life one year follow .</brief_summary>
