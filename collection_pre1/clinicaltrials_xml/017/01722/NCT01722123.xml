By choose status quo , decision-maker reserve option make alternate choice later time , thereby preserve possibility . Patients surrogates often make complex medical decision may little experience . Although clearly high risk , decision fatigue study population . To elucidate question , propose four arm study patient population high risk make complex decision . Participants randomly assign varied level decision make effort ass development resultant decision fatigue whether alters subsequent decision .</detailed_description>
