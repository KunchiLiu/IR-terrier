	<brief_summary>The investigator want find whether choline supplement protect muscle health young men common genetic vulnerability . Men , respond brief , intense set arm exercise common genetic profile , ask use choline supplement three week placebo three week . Before begin supplementation study 3 6 week investigator test response exercise challenge ask consume food record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An initial screening questionnaire determine general eligibility . The investigator screen white young male low moderate choline intake ( &lt; 450 mg/d ) CK response exercise ( high/low ) intense eccentric exercise ( 12 elbow flexor contraction non-dominant arm dumbbell 100 % maximal lift capacity ) 72 hour ( 3 day ) later draw 250 Î¼l capillary blood finger stick CK , metabolomic genetic measurement . The investigator plan recruit 30 CK responder 1958 A allele methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 ( MTHFD1 ) , present 60 % Caucasian male . All participant ask complete three day 24-hour diet interview online automate program provide National Cancer Institute . Participants intervention study also complete interview final three day two intervention period The recruit candidate initial exercise challenge intervention , second challenge three week first supplement ( randomized choline placebo ) , third challenge another three week complementary second supplement ( choline placebo first , placebo choline first ) . Samples identify code store indefinitely UNC Nutrition Research Institute permit analysis additional genetic marker relate muscle health choline metabolism capacity analysis marker become available . Such analysis may carry University North Carolina Nutrition Research Institute ( UNC NRI ) external laboratory provide service PI . Samples destroy additional analysis intend feasible anymore investigator continue research . Storage sample optional .</detailed_description>
