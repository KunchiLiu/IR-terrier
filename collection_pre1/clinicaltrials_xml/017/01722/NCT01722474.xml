	<brief_summary>The ASI Non-Invasive Arterial Stiffness Screening Device ( ASI Device ) investigational device development non-invasive assessment arterial stiffness . The ASI Device considerably small cost effective commercially available counterpart . As device readily portable , intend target use community ( home ) , oppose within hospital clinic setting . However , device still development , know whether capable determine arterial stiffness sensitivity consistency already commercial use . An added variable fact sensor ASI Device locate fingertip . Validation prerequisite obtain Health Canada approval device diagnostic purpose . The ASI Device test instrument capable provide similar measurement . Therefore , clinical trial compare ASI Device similar device necessary . The study compare measurement arterial stiffness central haemodynamic parameter obtain ASI Device similar measurement device already approve purpose Health Canada/United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Three Instruments Non-invasive Measurement Arterial Stiffness .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory , proof concept , open sequential registration comparative study design establish utility accuracy ASI Non-Invasive Arterial Stiffness Screening Device ( ASI-Device ) non-invasive vascular assessment arterial stiffness relative device already approve commercially available Canada United States . The pressure exert contraction heart create wave form , travel individual 's arterial trunk part body . The velocity ( speed ) wave form travel serve indicator degree arterial stiffness . The fast speed travel pulse wave stiffer artery . It demonstrate study contour ( shape ) waveform affect pulse wave velocity analysis shape acceptable surrogate determine pulse wave velocity ultimately determine severity arterial stiffness . This method analyse contour pulse wave determine severity arterial stiffness call pulse wave analysis ( PWA ) . The ASI Device non-invasively measure severity arterial stiffness derive pulse wave analysis . The study compare measurement arterial stiffness central haemodynamic parameter , derive pulse wave analysis obtain ASI Device , similar measurement SphygmoCor Px System AtCor CR-2000 CV Profiler Hypertension Inc , device already approval purpose Health Canada and/or United States Food Drug Administration . Three group individual seek ; 1 . Healthy participant ( n=25 ) 2 . Persons Type 2 Diabetes and/or Obesity ( n=15 ) 3 . Persons diagnose Cardiovascular/Vascular disease ( CAD PAD ) ( n=15 ) Participants ask provide write informed consent prior participation study . Eligible participant ask attend in-person visit undergo non-invasive vascular testing . Testing comprise : 1 . Pulse Wave Analysis use ASI Device 2 . Pulse Wave Analysis use SphygmoCor Device 3 . Pulse Wave Analysis use CR-2000 CV Profiler Although pulse wave contour analysis ( PWA ) demonstrate acceptable surrogate assessment arterial stiffness , Pulse Wave Velocity gold standard assessment arterial stiffness . As , VP-1000 , non-invasive vascular screening device , also use measure pulse wave velocity .</detailed_description>
