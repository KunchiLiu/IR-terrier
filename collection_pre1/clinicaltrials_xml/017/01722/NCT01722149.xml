	<brief_summary>MPM patient eligible surgical procedure like decortication pleuro-pneumectomy median survival 12 month palliative chemotherapy . Therefore , new therapeutic approach crucial need clinical situation . This phase I trial patient malignant pleural mesothelioma pleural effusion test safety fix single dose 1x10e6 adoptively transfer FAP-specific re-directed T cell give directly pleural effusion . Lymphocytes take 21 day transfer peripheral blood . CD8 positive T cell isolate re-programmed retroviral transfer chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) recognize FAP serve target structure MPM . - Trial immunomodulatory product / biological</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Re-directed T Cells Treatment ( FAP ) -Positive Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I trial patient malignant pleural mesothelioma . A fixed single dose adoptively transfer FAP-specific CD8 positive re-directed T cell give pleural effusion . Three patient time point screen operable treat re-directed T cell administer pleural effusion completion 3 cycle palliative chemotherapy . In case one AE grade III/IV one SAE - occurrence DLT judge treatment related independent safety monitor board - patient number expand 6 patient . The study stop one additional DLT occur also judge treatment relate . Patients treat 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cell injected pleural effusion . The study end 35 day adoptive T cell transfer . Re-directed FAP-specific T cell administer day 0 ( day 14 third cycle palliative chemotherapy ) . The study design demonstrate safety 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cell . The next patient enrol early , previous patient complete day +14 safety monitor board declare DLTs . The palliative chemotherapy part study protocol .</detailed_description>
