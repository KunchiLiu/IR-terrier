	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study give drug call levocetirizine patient colorectal cancer affect tumor response capecitabine bevacizumab . Capecitabine chemotherapy drug block tumor growth disrupt DNA RNA synthesis repair ( cell division survival ) . Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody block ability tumor grow spread inhibit growth blood vessel fee . Patients colorectal cancer develop resistance effect bevacizumab . Levocetirizine may decrease tumor resistance bevacizumab . Giving bevacizumab , capecitabine , levocetirizine dihydrochloride together may effective treatment refractory colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must histologically cytologically confirm refractory colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Patient must measurable disease defined lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥10 mm CT scan , ≥20 mm chest xray , ≥10 mm caliper clinical exam . Patient must document progressive disease within 3 month his/her recent cycle chemotherapy . Patient must refractory intolerant prior therapy fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , and/or antiangiogenic therapy . Patients KRAS wild type tumor must receive epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor cetuximab panitumumab . Patient must ≥ 18 year age . Patient must ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Patient must normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Patients must adequate renal function prior chemotherapy define serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level 2.0 Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Patient must able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document . Patient must history malignancy ≤ 3 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Patient must receive investigational agent . Patient must know active brain metastasis . Patients previously treat brain metastasis eligible . Patients know brain active metastasis must exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patient must history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition levocetirizine , capecitabine , bevacizumab , agent use study . Patient must know dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 mL/min Cockcroft Gault formula ) would prelude use capecitabine . Patient must know proteinuria ≥ 500mg/24 hour . Patient must uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patient must pregnant and/or breastfeed . Patient must negative urine pregnancy test within seven day study entry . Patient must know HIVpositive combination antiretroviral potential pharmacokinetic interaction levocetirizine , capecitabine , bevacizumab . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
