	<detailed_description>A . Introduction Review literature Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) broadly define alteration mental status cognitive function occur presence liver failure . The clinical picture HE arise complication chronic , rarely , acute liver disease . HE occur 70 % patient cirrhosis time course disease ( 1,2 ) . It characterize personality change , intellectual impairment depress level consciousness . HE may clinical unapparent ( minimal HE ) detect abnormal neuropsychometric neurophysiological test ( 3 ) . The common presentation overt HE occur patient advanced cirrhosis portal-systemic collateral circulation . Episodes HE patient cirrhosis induce precipitating factor , like dehydration , hypokalemia , large protein intake , gastrointestinal bleeding , constipation , infection , use psychotropic drug , alcohol intake acute liver injury ( hepatitis ) . Pathogenesis hepatic encephalopathy In patient liver cirrhosis , increase structural replacement hepatocytes connective tissue lead loss function hepatic parenchymal tissue reduction detoxification capacity liver . In addition , develop portal hypertension lead formation collateral circulation non-detoxified blood by-pass liver reach systemic circulation . Both mechanisms contribute neurotoxin present portal vein blood reach brain via systemic circulation . A number neurotoxin implicated pathogenesis HE ammonia important ( 4,5 ) . Fundamental conceptual advance understand hepatic encephalopathy confirm central role ammonia pathogenesis portosystemic encephalopathy . Ammonia disrupt function neurones astrocyte , give rise symptom hepatic encephalopathy . Classification/Grading HE classify type A ( Acute Liver Failure ) , B ( Portosystemic shunt without intrinsic liver disease ) C ( patient cirrhosis portal hypertension/or portosystemic shunt ) ( 5,6 ) . In cirrhotics , type C HE classify Episodic , Persistent Minimal HE . Chronic persistent overt HE patient relatively stable little day day fluctuation mental status . Episodic ( Unstable ) HE patient define previously stable , hour possibly day develop clinically discernible feature HE , require medical attention hospitalization . Minimal HE clinically inapparent detect abnormal neuropsychometric neurophysiological test ( 3 ) . A precise gradation HE essential prognosticate plan appropriate approach treatment . According severity , HE traditionally divide four stage base alteration state consciousness , intellectual function , behaviour , neuromuscular sign ( West Haven scale ) ( 5 ) . A new classification recently propose call SONIC classification ( 7 ) . This necessary differentiation minimal Grade I HE reliable , good inter-rater reproducibility identification Grade II HE . It suggest patient minimal HE Grade I HE group together . It stress worsen cognitive function continuum rather categorical emphasize Vienna 11th World Congress . It classify patient cirrhosis unimpaired impaired neurocognitive function . Impaired cognitive function subdivide Covert HE ( Minimal HE Grade I HE ) Overt HE ( Grades II-IV ) . It thus inclusive West Haven criterion , yet emphasize continuity oppose categorical . The neurocognitive function impair , unstable patient fluctuate acute confusional syndrome coma ( Grades I IV ) . They call Type C- episodic HE patient . Therapy hepatic encephalopathy The main objective therapy HE ( ) decrease intestinally derive toxin produce excessive bacterial activity decrease ammonia production ( b ) increase ammonia detoxification ( 1,2,8,9 ) . 1 . Decrease ammonia production : Enteric production ammonia decrease non-absorbable disaccharide lactulose lactitol non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin . Lactulose/lactitol pas small bowel undigested . In colon , bacteria degrade lactulose various organic acid ( e.g . lactic acid , acetic acid ) subsequent lower colonic pH . The mode ammonia lower may involve bacteriostatic effect , cathartic effect , enhancement conversion ammonia ammonium excess hydrogen ion . Presumably ammonium excrete feces eliminate ( 9 , 10 ) . Lactulose remain main stay therapy overt HE , despite paucity inconsistency clinical trial demonstrate efficacy ( 11 ) . The dosage adjust accomplish two three soft bowel movement day . Lactulose give nasogastric tube retention enema . The usual dose 30-120 ml day divide dos . Stool pH six . Side effect include bloat flatulence . Severe diarrhea dehydration hyperglycemia acidosis occur dosage high . Non absorbable antibiotic neomycin , metronidazole , paromomycin traditional antibiotic treatment HE ( 12 ) . Due ototoxic nephrotoxic side effect , neomycin use infrequently . Metronidazole cause much side effect therapy extend beyond two week avoid neuropathy . More recently rifaximin demonstrate good lactulose ( 13 ) lactitol ( 14 , 15 ) patient hepatic encephalopathy . 2 . Increase ammonia detoxification : Levels ammonia decrease detoxification . L-ornithine- L-aspartate ( LOLA ) , salt natural amino acid ornithine aspartate act mechanism substrate activation detoxify ammonia . Detailed mechanism action clinical trial LOLA discuss . L-ornithine- L-aspartate ( LOLA ) : L-ornithine- L-aspartate ( LOLA ) salt natural amino acid ornithine aspartate . 1 . Mechanism action : LOLA stimulate urea cycle ( metabolizes ammonia urea ) liver ( 16,17 ) . In periportal hepatocytes synthesize urea , ornithine serf activator ornithine transcarbamoylase carbamoyl phosphate synthetase . In addition , ornithine act substrate urea genesis . Hence , LOLA activate periportal urea cycle liver . Aspartate ornithine , conversion alpha- ketoglutarate , also serve carbon source perivenous glutamine synthesis . In skeletal muscle , LOLA upregulates glutamine synthesis substrate provision glutamine synthetase , although decreased muscle mass cirrhosis allow synthesis significant . Ammonia consume urea formation glutamine synthesis , thereby LOLA decrease blood ammonia level . Urea glutamine ( metabolism ) excrete via kidney . LOLA thus activate two important metabolic pathway human body detoxification ammonia . In cirrhosis , remain liver cell mass retain capacity detoxify ammonia oppose acute liver failure . 2 . Trials LOLA Hepatic encephalopathy : LOLA use many year treatment HE cirrhosis liver , especially minimal overt chronic low grade HE . The clinical efficacy LOLA already comprehensively investigate report therapeutic observation , clinical trial ( 16 , 18-25 ) meta-analysis ( 26,27 ) . In study , use LOLA infusion , oral administration combination two , document patient mild severe liver insufficiency . LOLA show statistically significant effect respect improvement mental state ( reduction HE grade ) , increase detoxification ( reduction ammonia concentration blood ) positive effect psychomotor function ( reduction time require number connection test ) Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy overt chronic Grade I-II Hepatic Encephalopathy , acute overt HE . With finding , evidence-based medicine criterion demonstrate efficacy fulfil . In recent randomized placebo control study conduct Karachi ( 25 ) , patient acute HE randomize receive LOLA placebo . NCT-A , ammonia level , clinical grade HE duration hospitalization assess . Improvement HE high ( n=40 , 66.7 % ) LOLA group ( n=28 , 46.7 % , p=0.027 ) . Duration hospitalization lower LOLA group compare placebo ( p=0.025 ) . No side effect observe either group . 3 . Adverse effect LOLA L-ornithine- L-aspartate usually well tolerate ( 18-25 ) . No serious adverse event report far clinical trial . The various adverse event report 14 % patient treated LOLA include : 1 . Nausea 2 . Vomiting 3 . Fatigue B . Materials Methods 1 .

Goyal , BC Sharma ) Study Intervention : The patient randomize receive either placebo LOLA dose 30 gram daily , intravenous infusion 24 hour . ( The study drug placebo provide Win Medicare Pvt Ltd. , 1400 , Modi tower , 98 , Nehru Place , New Delhi- 110019 ) . LOLA supply ampoule ( ampoule contain 5 gram LOLA 10 ml clear solution ) . Six ampoule ( i.e 30 g LOLA ) infuse 24 hour . The placebo vial ( 10 ml sterile water vial ) identically supply infuse . The dose LOLA ( 30 g 24 hour ) base previous study , show efficacy dose decrease ammonia level ( 17,26,28 ) . Both group shall receive treatment 5 day . Patients group continue hepatic encephalopathy end study period ( 5 day ) , receive standard care treatment , would counsel liver transplant . 4 . Laboratory test : Biochemical test : Hemogram , blood glucose , liver function test , prothrombin time , serum electrolyte , blood urea serum creatinine do baseline , 2nd 5th day treatment , earlier indicate . Serum AFP do admission . Serum cytokine level ( Interleukin 1 , 6 , 10 TNF-alpha ) level do baseline 5 day treatment . Microbiologic test : A diagnostic paracentesis do patient ascites , baseline , diagnose Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis . A repeat cell count ( Total differential ) shall do day 5 patient diagnose Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis . Blood culture , urine culture , culture aspirate endotracheal tube ventilate patient aerobic anerobic bacteria , fungi shall do . A chest radiograph shall also do . Ammonia estimation : Fasting venous ammonia level estimate use blood ammonia meter ( PocketChem BA ) baseline daily next 5 day . The PocketChem BA ammonia meter apparatus quick bedside blood ammonia estimation . It show acceptable precision , adequate linearity , satisfactory agreement enzymatic reference method commonly use clinical laboratory ( 29 ) . Measurement Principle : The PocketChem BA measure blood ammonia base micro-diffusion method . When blood sample ( 20 microlitre ) apply sample-receiving layer test area test strip , alkaline buffer agent ( borate buffer ) impregnate layer dissolve make specimen alkaline . The ammonium ion specimen gasify alkaline state ammonia gas . The ammonia gas pass pore spacer indicator ( bromocresol green ) trigger color development . As degree color development proportional concentration ammonia gas produce , blood ammonia level quantitatively determine measure color . Tests etiologic evaluation : Etiology cirrhosis take alcohol history significant alcohol intake ( 40-60gm/day female , 60-80 gm/day males 10 year ) . Each patient test Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg ) Anti-hepatitis C ( HCV ) antibody use third generation commercial ELISA . Wherever indicate , autoimmune hepatitis diagnose use antinuclear antibody , anti-smooth muscle antibody anti-LKM ; hemochromatosis use serum iron , TIBC , ferritin transferrin saturation . Each patient shall abdominal ultrasonography . UGI endoscopy would do , indicate . 5 . Standard Care Treatment : Standard care treatment patient cirrhosis overt acute encephalopathy shall give patient . 1 . Identification potential cause alter mental state i.e . head injury drug intoxication shall do . 2 .
