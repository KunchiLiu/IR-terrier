	<brief_summary>Some Dermatologists prefer absorbable suture non-absorbable suture closure punch biopsy site . The reason often preferred patient pay another visit get suture material remove . Also patient inconvenience return office suture removal1 . However , absorbable suture material currently use Dermatologists expensive . In order evaluate way reduce cost patient , compare less expensive suture material ( chromic gut ) one absorbable suture material currently use clinical practice ( PDS ) . Patients eligible choose participate study undergo punch biopsy suture use close skin . The type suture receive patient randomize , like flip coin . Group A receive PDS Group B receive chromic gut suture . After one week time , patient return clinic dermatologist evaluate biopsy site redness , wound infection , wound opening , scar formation . The patient give questionnaire evaluate satisfaction cosmetic outcome pain cause suture material . If suture come visit , patient ask report day suture fell . The patient return two time next two week receive questionnaire evaluation dermatologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Polyglactin 910 Chromic Gut Suture Closure Punch Biopsy Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Study This study seek compare two absorbable suture material ( PDS chromic gut ) closure punch biopsy sit . This information could contribute cost saving increase convenience patient . Background A punch biopsy full thickness skin biopsy perform Dermatologists diagnose various skin condition . The incision biopsy range 2 - 6mm width2 . There several recommendation way manage biopsy site include use non-absorbable suture nylon , heal second intention use absorbable suture PDS Polyglactin 9101,3 . The benefit absorbable suture non-absorbable suture reduce cost patient pay suture removal visit . Also , patient extra inconvenience return clinic second time2,3 . There one case literature compare absorbable non-absorbable suture material closure skin punch biopsy sites2 . Never , study compare two different absorbable suture set . We believe may less expensive suture material would yield performance current one . If case , information could benefit Dermatology community would provide less expensive alternative suture material close skin punch biopsy site . Therefore , would cut overall cost related routine procedure . Chromic gut absorbable suture make natural fiber sheep cattle intestine . It one first absorbable suture available inexpensive . The difference plain gut chromic gut chromic gut treat chromic salt allow retain tensile strength longer . The suture integrity last 10-14 day ( time suture begin absorption process ) complete absorption 15-60 day . Chromic gut document moderate high tissue reactivity4,5 . PDS absorbable , monofilament make synthetic material ( polyester ) . It new , expensive , absorbable suture material . The suture integrity last 45-60 day total absorption 180 day . PDS document low tissue reactivity show maintain tensile strength presence bacterial infection4,5 . Performance PDS chromic gut suture close punch biopsy site would compare study . We hope information collect could show less expensive suture ( chromic gut ) safely use closing skin punch biopsy site , therefore improve clinical practice procedure save health care system money . Number Subjects Up 100 subject anticipate project . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria In order patient participate study , must : 1 . Be age 18 old 2 . Having punch biopsy procedure perform benign reason 3 . Biopsy site shoulder ankles Exclusion Criteria Patients may participate study : 1 . Having punch biopsy procedure perform suspicious cancerous lesion include basal squamous cell carcinoma melanoma 2 . Biopsy site face , palm , sol groin area Vulnerable Subjects Elderly subject include study . However , subject coerce way participate . As subject , investigator explain purpose research nature duration procedure elderly subject . The investigator explain risk breach confidentiality , possible societal benefit associate study , right subject withdraw consent time without penalty . The investigator ask subject confirm fully understand issue , subject ask question research . Before data collection occur , subject 's question concern study must answer satisfaction . Method Subject Identification Recruitment Patients age 18 meet study 's inclusion criterion ask office visit willingness participate study compare two absorbable suture material ( PDS chromic gut ) closure punch biopsy site . Patients choose participate must sign consent form study protocol explain fully understood . The dermatologist perform punch biopsy close skin either PDS chromic gut suture . The patient randomize either Group A receive PDS suture Group B receive chromic gut suture . A nurse place patient group A B base whether even odd patient . Methods Procedures Applied Human Subjects During office visit , patient age 18 meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion invite participate study . Patients choose participate give verbal explanation study protocol investigator . A punch biopsy perform site close one simple percutaneous suture use P-3 needle aseptic technique . The type suture receive patient randomize . Group A receive PDS suture Group B receive chromic gut suture . The wound dress bacitracin adhesive bandage . The site treat twice daily bacitracin bandage change patient . After one week time , patient return clinic dermatologist evaluate biopsy site redness , wound infection , wound dehiscence , scar hypertrophy . The patient give questionnaire evaluate satisfaction cosmetic outcome pain cause suture . If suture come visit , patient ask report day suture fell . The patient return one week evaluation perform Dermatologist well give questionnaire . Lastly , patient return fourth total visit give evaluation Dermatologist well give questionnaire . Setting Mode Administering Suture Materials , Evaluation Questionaire Data collection take place follow location : • Face Skin Center Township Colony Park 201 Northlake Avenue , Suite 211 Ridgeland , MS 39157 Each participant educate study protocol data collection begin . The Dermatologist perform biopsy place suture . The patient receive bacitracin oitment apply biopsy site adhesive bandage administer . Patients give follow-up appointment one week . Patients return clinic one week . Their Dermatologist perform procedure evaluate biopsy site patient give questionnaire complete ask report applicable suture fell . This process continue every week one month . Data Collection , Storage , Confidentiality Data collect study personnel associate patient 's name . Study personnel interview subject order complete standardize questionnaire . Patients ' record keep locked filing cabinet data collection site . All digital patient information password protect . Access data limit investigator . Data keep six year follow completion study , shred destroy . Potential Risks Discomforts There financial risk associate study . There , however , risk breach confidentiality . Although breach confidentiality would reversible , would cause minimal harm subject , type suture patient receive sensitive medical legal problem . Protocol minimize risk associate study ensure low probability subject harm way . Patients ' record keep locked filing cabinet data collection site . All digital patient information password protect . Access data limit investigator . Data keep two year follow completion study , shred destroy . Risk Classification The overall risk classification research minimal . Minimizing Risks Patients ' record keep principal investigator 's medical office lock filing cabinet . All digital patient information password protect . Access data limit investigator . Data keep two year follow completion study , shred destroy . Potential Benefits There direct benefit patient participate study . Societal benefit expect research , provide information could contribute cost-saving strategy quality life enhancement associate skin punch biopsy . Risk/Benefit Ratio Payment Participation Subjects provide financial compensation participation study . Financial Obligations Subjects Subjects incur financial obligation result participate study except cost punch biopsy procedure . They charge follow-up visit . The cost punch biopsy procedure increase participation .
