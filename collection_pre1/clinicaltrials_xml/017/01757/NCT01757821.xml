	<brief_summary>The goal stroke rehabilitation restore function weak side body . However , often difficult task accomplish due damage stroke , increased excitability non-stroke side brain inhibits stroke side function optimally . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) non-invasive form brain stimulation enhance excitability stroke side apply low-frequency non-stroke side . By `` inhibiting inhibition '' ( i.e . disinhibition ) , rTMS promotes adaptive brain reorganization follow stroke . Previous research healthy individual demonstrate enhanced effect low-frequency rTMS precede high-frequency ( excitatory ) rTMS stimulation know priming . Our lab previously demonstrate safety 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS adult child chronic stroke . However , currently unknown whether addition prim stimulation low-frequency rTMS enhance excitability stroke hemisphere . Our study examine three rTMS intervention twelve adult ( least 18 year ) : 1 . ) 10 minute real priming follow 10 minute low-frequency rTMS , 2 . ) 10 minute fake prim follow 10 minute low-frequency rTMS , 3 . ) 20 minute low-frequency rTMS . Participants receive three intervention randomize order . Each week , participant complete two pretest 3 posttest session consist behavioral measure weak upper extremity function cortical excitability addition receive one rTMS intervention . Following week test treatment , subject take one week rest break crossing-over receive another intervention . We hypothesize follow : 1 . ) Primed rTMS result significantly reduce inhibition significantly increase excitation stroke side vs. fake prim rTMS low-frequency rTMS give alone 2 . ) Primed rTMS result great improvement paretic hand function . This study innovative intend compare prim unprimed rTMS stroke brain could acknowledge effective delivery method rTMS potentially yield great rehabilitative outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recovery follow stroke difficult neuronal death ischemic insult also maladaptive brain reorganization occur exaggerated inhibition impart over-compensating contralesional primary motor area ( M1 ) onto ipsilesional M1 via transcallosal pathway . Advancement stroke rehabilitation depend innovative treatment like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) posse ability disrupt excessive inhibition . Through previous NIH/NICHD funding , sponsor 's research team confirm safety efficacy rTMS adult ( 1R01 HD053153-01A2 ) child ( 1RC1 HD063838-01 ) stroke use 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS apply contralesional M1 produce disinhibition ipsilesional M1 . With feasibility prim rTMS demonstrate , propose research plan directly compare prim rTMS unprimed rTMS . The investigator investigate whether pretreatment inhibitory low-frequency rTMS excitatory high-frequency prim effective sham-primed low-frequency rTMS correct exaggerated interhemispheric inhibition act ipsilesional M1 . While may sound contradictory , Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro theory bidirectional plasticity support concept . The long-term goal discover effective rTMS protocol safely up-regulate ipsilesional M1 , render potent neuronal network voluntary recruitment . By study efficacy prim measured amount cortical excitability ipsilesional contralesional hemisphere , advantageous delivery rTMS may realize eventually incorporate research trial clinical practice . The study pose significant innovation explores role metaplasticity rehabilitation use rTMS . The investigator employ double-blind crossover study use twelve adult participant stroke . Because heterogeneity stroke type location subject , crossover design reduce variability subject serf control . Specific Aim # 1 : Compare effect 6-Hz prim vs. unprimed low-frequency rTMS cortical excitability chronic stroke.Cortical excitability explore TMS use ipsilesional paired-pulse testing , cortical silent period testing , interhemispheric inhibition ( IHI ) paired-pulse testing . Working hypothesis : 1 . Primed rTMS result great increase 3-ms 15-ms ipsilesional paired-pulse single-pulse ( ipsilesional PP/SP ) ratio unprimed rTMS , indicate decreased intracortical inhibition ( GABAA-mediated ) great intracortical facilitation , respectively . 2 . Primed rTMS result great decrease unprimed rTMS duration cortical silent period , indicate decrease inhibition ( GABAB-mediated ) . 3 . Primed rTMS result great increase IHI PP/SP ratio non-stroke stroke hemisphere direction correspond decrease IHI PP/SP ratio stroke non-stroke hemisphere direction unprimed rTMS . This consistent less inhibition impart onto stroke hemisphere non-stroke hemisphere great inhibition impart non-stroke hemisphere stroke hemisphere . Specific Aim # 2 : Compare effect 6-Hz prim vs. unprimed low-frequency rTMS functional outcome chronic stroke . Functional outcome assess paretic hand performance Box Block test . Working hypothesis : 1 . Primed rTMS result great improvement Box Block test .</detailed_description>
