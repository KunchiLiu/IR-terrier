	<brief_summary>RSV bronchiolitis child still associate significant morbidity mortality . RSV infection result increase mucus production , edema inflammation lower airway impair mucociliary clearance . Infants child age 1 year particularly vulnerable complication atelectasis secondary bacterial infection . These child often need non-invasive invasive ventilation . Atelectasis common child small airway decrease cough strength . There still much uncertainty treatment RSV . Treatment consist primarily supportive therapy tube feed additional respiratory support necessary . There also limit evidence use nebulizer beta-agonists and/or hypertonic saline . The cough assist mechanical in- exsufflator use primarily patient neuromuscular disease augment cough capacity . In patient , demonstrate use assist cough result significant decrease number respiratory infection . Moreover , evidence use case acute respiratory deterioration massive atelectasis , atelectasis correct intubation avoid . The aim study investigate use CoughAssist device child RSV bronchiolitis associate well respiratory outcome .</brief_summary>
