	<brief_summary>The primary curative treatment lung cancer patient surgery , chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy ( either depend extent disease ) . Surgical resection usually require removal lobe lung ( lobectomy ) . There , however , patient unable lobectomy . There several reason patient lobectomy include prior operation area lung poor lung function . Sub-lobe operation ( le full lobectomy ) , alternative patient . Types sub-lobe operation include wedge resection segmentectomy . However , randomize trial early stage lung cancer patient compare lobectomy versus wedge resection show bad local control cancer wedge resection . Therefore , localize disease wedge resection consider inadequate operation . This inadequacy compensate radiation seed add site wedge resection . Iodine-125 ( I-125 ) commonly use radiation seed purpose . I-125 , however , unfortunately relatively long half life ( time take activity become half ) 2 month . Therefore , patient technically 'radioactive ' average 6 month 1 year . This seriously compromise quality life . Cesium-131 another radiation seed may effectively treat lung cancer patient . Cs-131 previously use prostate cancer successfully . Cs-131 similar energy I-125 much short half life ( 9days compare 60 day I-125 ) . Patients receive Cs-131 radiation seed expect radioactive 30 day ( 1 month ) compare 180 day ( 6 month ) I-125 . The objective study use Cs-131 radiation seed lung cancer patient plan undergo wedge resection localize disease follow patient cancer control toxicity . These result compare pre-existing data I-125 treatment outcome lung cancer patient wedge resection localize disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A lobectomy ( removal full lobe lung removal Â¼ - 1/5 entire lung ) part primary curative treatment people lung cancer . There , however , patient unable lobectomy . There several reason patient lobectomy include prior operation area lung poor lung function . Sub-lobe operation ( le full lobectomy ) , alternative patient . Types sub-lobe operation include wedge resection segmentectomy . However , randomize trial early stage lung cancer patient compare lobectomy versus wedge resection show cancer control well individual wedge resection . Localized disease wedge resection alone therefore considered inadequate operation . This inadequacy , however , compensate radiation seed implant ( add ) site wedge resection . Iodine-125 radiation seed currently common radioactive material implant operative bed wedge resection . However , I-125 half-life 60 day . This cause patient `` radioactive '' 6 month 1 year . When individual radioactive must take necessary precaution result significantly compromise quality life . These precaution 1 ) continuous close contact ( le 3 foot ) significant duration time ( 15 minute ) , 2 ) close contact pregnant woman child , 3 ) adequate precaution especially air travel 4 ) risk radioactive seed displacement several month . The local control cancer treatment &gt; 95 % _ % . Cesium-131 novel radiation seed energy I-125 much short half life ( 9days ) . That mean Cs-131 seed give radiation faster rate . When radioactive seed give radiation longer radioactive danger radioactivity longer exist . With half life 9 day , Cs-131 give radiation 1 month . This significantly reduce time patient 'radioactive ' . Therefore , Cs-131 less negative affect quality life I-125 . In addition , Cs-131 's significantly faster rate radiation dissemination , faster grow cancer ( especially lung cancer ) cell kill efficiently thereby increase cancer control rate . In addition , less total radiation time may result reduce short term long term side effect . Cs-131 FDA approve use mostly prostate cancer . Our experience Cs-131 prostate cancer show well tolerate treatment excellent cure rate . The primary study endpoint assess local control localize lung cancer limited resection ( wedge resection segmentectomy ) Cs-131 seed placement comparison previously assess local control localize lung cancer limit resection I-125 seed placement . The primary objective ass local control wedge resection Cs-131 implant . The secondary objective ass quality life ( related side effect ) Cs-131 seed placement limit surgical resection lung cancer compare already exist data I-125 tolerability . Procedures part regular cancer care may do whether patient enrolls research study include : 1 . CT scan patient chest 2 . Medistinoscopy ( surgeon suspicious cancer patient 's lymph node ) , - If cancer spread lymph node , patient longer eligible study classification disease would longer NSCLC . Patients would alternately receive appropriate , standard treatment Standard procedures do patient part study ; 1 ) Quality life questionnaire Follow-up Patients monitor local recurrence , regional recurrence distant recurrence progression three year . Local recurrence : recurrence within lobe hilum ( N1 node ) , staple line treatment effect scar subside . Regional recurrence : recurrence within another lobe pleura side resection , ipsilateral mediastinal ( N2 ) node . Distant recurrence : recurrence within contralateral lobe , contralateral mediastinal ( N3 ) nod distant metastatic disease ( organ ) . Patients also monitor additional primary regional recurrence , histological confirmation whenever possible . Autopsy report obtain whenever possible . A copy death certificate also obtain . Protocol follow-up perform 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 month yearly 5 year . The yearly follow-up visit Years 4 5 consist either phone call clinical visit ( investigator 's discretion ) vital status . These follow-up visit occur + 60 day yearly anniversary date resection . A CT scan perform pre-operatively 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 month . QoL use SF36 UCSD Shortness Breath Questionnaire obtain pre-operatively 3 , 12 24 month . Post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy may give discretion treat physician . Postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy never perform . Evaluation Outcomes Local Recurrence ( primary endpoint ) Local recurrence indicate follow-up examination show growth primary tumor abnormality resect lobe CT scan . Since scar may occur adjacent brachytherapy site , CT scan obtain 3 month . This form baseline study local recurrence judge . Increased parenchymal opacification ( 25 % ) adjacent staple line/mesh line consider suspicious local recurrence . The repeated CT scan allow significant change observe even slight image artifact metal seed may interfere interpretation CT scan . Any suspicious area confirm needle biopsy . Scans Disease Relapse Unconfirmed Biopsy If biopsy suspicious area feasible , PET scan require . Copies PET scan , 3- month ( baseline ) CT scan current CT scan . Quality Life As secondary outcome , patient-centered quality life ( QoL ) data measure use SF36 dyspnea measure use UCSD Shortness Breath Questionnaire . [ Eakin , 1998 ] These ill patient significant pulmonary morbidity . It important quantify change overall health pulmonary-specific symptom population . Each patient act control . These validated instrument use many trial patient severe lung disease . Measurements undertaken 3 , 12 24 month surgery .</detailed_description>
