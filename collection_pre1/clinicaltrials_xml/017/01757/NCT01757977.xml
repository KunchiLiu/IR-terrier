	<brief_title>A Comparison Performance Standard Double Lumen Tubes With Vivasight DLâ„¢ Double Lumen Tubes Lung Isolation Patients Undergoing Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single lung ventilation frequently carry facilitate surgery lung pleura . In instance achieve insertion double-lumen endotracheal tube selectively ventilate one lung . Precise position tubes essential optimal performance . It become standard care perform bronchoscopy confirm tube position . A new double lumen endotracheal tube ( Vivasight DL ) recently develop . It feature standard double lumen endotracheal tube also incorporate internal camera , connect external screen , allow continuous confirmation tube position . This randomized , single blind controlled trial . The participant allocate two study group ( Vivasight DL standard DLT ) , primary airway management device respectively Vivasight DL double lumen tube standard double lumen endotracheal tube . Clinical Research Ethics Committee approval obtain . Suitable participant recruit write informed consent . Standard anesthetic preassessment anesthesia provide . Consenting patient pass inclusion exclusion criterion randomly allocate either 2 study group . Protocol attempt placement tube position confirmation follow . The investigator monitor number parameter , include time ease tube insertion , ability verify tube position primary imaging modality group , need perform tube position adjustment maneuver , need use fiberoptic bronchoscope case , quality lung collapse , problem ventilation . The primary hypothesis new Vivasight DL tube system provide comparable optical view fiberoptic scope view obtain via standard double lumen endotracheal tube order confirm optimal position .</detailed_description>
