	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics SP-8203</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , single-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study safety , tolerability , PK escalate single dos multiple dos SP 8203 healthy adult male female subject . In SAD Part , first cohort 8 subject randomly assign receive single IV dose either SP-8203 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) . Following medical review safety , PK , biomarker data , subsequent cohort 8 new subject receive high single dos SP-8203 ( 6 subject ) placebo ( 2 subject ) . Dose escalation continue single MTD SP-8203 identify . If single-dose MTD define within project dose range ( see Section 4.1.3 ) , additional cohort 8 subject may add receive high dos achieve objective study . Alternate dos may administer follow medical review result cohort . In MAD Part study first cohort 8 subject receive single dose SP 8203 every day 1 subject receive single dose placebo every day 7 consecutive day . Doses administer time ( ± 15 minute ) every day . Following medical review safety biomarker data , subsequent cohort 7 drug-naive subject receive high single dos SP-8203 ( 6 subject ) placebo ( 2 subject ) every day 7 consecutive day ( see Section 4.1.3 ) . Study drug dose-escalation continue multiple-dose MTD regimen SP-8203 identify . If multiple-dose MTD define within range , additional cohort 8 subject may add achieve objective study . Alternate dose and/or dose regimen may administer follow medical review safety , biomarker , PK result SAD Part , prior cohort MAD Part study . The MTD define high dose lead unacceptable toxicity one subject base frequency , nature , severity AEs safety parameter abnormality . The Investigator , Sponsor , Medical Monitor jointly assess general safety tolerability dose base available data prior escalate next high dose . Successive high dos administer previous dos adequately tolerate . Intermediate dos may test , dose level may repeat , appropriate , depend safety profile observe . Each subject complete Screening , Baseline , Treatment , Follow-Up Phases . The Screening Phase conduct outpatient basis within 30 day , sooner 3 day , prior start Baseline Phase . The Baseline Phase consist admission CRU final qualification assessment . In SAD Part , Treatment Phase consist dosing ( subject consider enrolled study ) , postdose safety assessment , blood urine collection next 48 hour . Subjects discharge approximately 48 hour study drug administration , provide available assessment clinically acceptable Investigator , return follow-up assessment 2-4 day later . In MAD Part , The Treatment Phase last 9 day follow first dose . Subjects dose morning 7 consecutive day . Safety assessment make , blood urine collect prior , prescribed interval postdose , next 9 consecutive day . Subjects discharge approximately 48 hour follow last dose , return follow-up assessment 2-4 day later . Safety evaluate physical examination , evaluation vital sign , 12 lead ECG , Holter monitoring , clinical laboratory blood urine test result , AE assessment . Blood sample determine plasma concentration SP 8203 metabolite , assessment Mn-SOD mRNA , FRAP biomarkers obtain immediately prior dose prescribed interval Treatment Phase . Urine sample collect predose pool urine sample collect postdose determination SP 8203 renal clearance metabolite .</detailed_description>
