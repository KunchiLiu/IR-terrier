	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study effect erismodegib ( LDE225 ) disseminate tumor cell ( DTCs ) patient stage III-III estrogen receptor ( ER ) -negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer . The presence DTCs complete treatment breast cancer may link recurrence disease . LDE225 may eliminate DTCs bone marrow reduce risk recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>PreRegistration Inclusion Criteria Diagnosis pathologic stage II III ER , PR , HER2 negative primary invasive ductal invasive lobular breast carcinoma . ER negative define Allred score 02 . PR negative define Allred score 04 . HER2 negative define IHC score 01 and/or notamplified FISH testing . All surgery breast cancer ( defined surgical excision cancer negative margin mastectomy ) must complete . Undergone axillary lymph node surgery ( either sentinel lymph node biopsy axillary lymph node dissection ) per institutional standard . Completed ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy radiation therapy recommend treating physician . Completed recent cancer therapy ( surgery , radiation , chemotherapy ) less 3 24 week prior registration . Note : patient receive experimental neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy surgical therapy ( exception Hh inhibitor ) participation clinical trial NOT exclude study long trial exclude patient enrol additional adjuvant clinical trial enrol trial compromise endpoint ( primary secondary ) primary clinical trial . In addition , patient must complete experimental therapy le 4 week 5 half life ( whichever longer ) 24 week prior registration . For patient enrol neoadjuvant / adjuvant / surgical trial , endpoint trial review prior consent patient sonidegib trial . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Patient ( legally authorize representative applicable ) must able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document . PreRegistration Exclusion Criteria Concurrent treatment standard therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , target therapy radiotherapy ) within 3 week start sonidegib . Treatment investigational anticancer agent within 4 week 5 halflives whichever longer , initialize treatment sonidegib . Previous treatment systemic sonidegib Hh pathway inhibitor . Diagnosis neuromuscular disorder ( e.g. , inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , spinal muscular atrophy ) concomitant treatment drug recognize cause rhabdomyolysis ( HMG CoA inhibitor ( statin ) , clofibrate gemfibrozil ) discontinue least 2 week prior start sonidegib treatment . If essential patient stay statin control hyperlipidemia , pravastatin may use extra caution . Known HIVpositive combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction sonidegib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Registration Inclusion Criteria Presence bone marrow DTCs completion intend breast cancer therapy include surgery , ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy therapy , radiation indicate . Note : Bone marrow aspiration perform consented patient evaluate DTCs provide patient meet eligibility criterion describe section . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Platelets ≥ 80,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x IULN Plasma creatine phosphokinase ( CK ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Able swallow capsule . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 7 day date registration . Women childbearing potential must agree use dual form adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control , nonhormonal IUD IUS , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 20 month final dose study treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Registration Exclusion Criteria Evidence distant metastasis present CT scan , bone scan , physical exam within one year prior entry trial . History malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition sonidegib agent use study . Planning embark new strenuous exercise regimen initiation study treatment . Muscular activity , strenuous exercise , result significant increase plasma CK level avoid sonidegib treatment . Diagnosis medical condition would lead lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract know malabsorption syndrome . Taking warfarin Coumadin derivatives potential interaction sonidegib . Receiving treatment medication know moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 drug metabolize CYP2B6 CYP2C9 narrow therapeutic index discontinue start treatment sonidegib . Medications strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor discontinue least 7 day strong CYP3A4/5 inducer least 2 week prior start treatment sonidegib . Concurrent uncontrolled medical condition may interfere participation study potentially affect interpretation study data . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant heart disease , include one following : Angina pectoris within 3 month Acute myocardial infarction within 3 month QTcF &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female screen ECG A past medication history clinically significant ECG abnormality family history prolong QTinterval syndrome Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Pregnant woman exclude study sonidegib Hh inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother sonidegib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated sonidegib .</criteria>
