	<brief_summary>The objective study determine safety , tolerability preliminary efficacy alemtuzumab infusion treatment CIDP . Eligible subject treat alemtuzumab begin study follow three year . During three year period , subject go monthly safety evaluation consist blood urine testing , symptom survey examination . Detailed neurological test include nerve conduction test , Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale ( CIDP/RODS ) Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale ( ONLS ) assessment perform every six month three year . The study also investigate compare responsiveness outcome measure use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label multi-center trial alemtuzumab treatment Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) . The study 4 phase . Approximately 16 eligible participant receive least one cycle alemtuzumab ( 5 day drug infusion ) . Additional cycle alemtuzumab ( 3 day drug infusion ) may provide discretion participant ' treat physician clinical worsening occurs . Phase 1 : Screening Participants meet inclusion exclusion criterion sign informed consent document enter screen phase undergo baseline evaluation . Phase 2 : Drug Infusion Participants receive alemtuzumab infusion use standardize protocol . Participants maintain prior CIDP therapy drug infusion follow regular interval . Phase 3 . Alteration CIDP therapy CIDP therapy may alter discretion treat physician - either taper , discontinuation , increase current additional medication . For participant chronic corticosteroid therapy , follow pulse IV methylprednisolone alemtuzumab cycle , corticosteroid taper rapidly far possible accord accord investigator 's discretion . While aim discontinue corticosteroid , recognize participant suppress pituitary-adrenal axis complete discontinuation may possible . Phase 4 : Extended Follow-up Each participant follow per protocol minimum 36 month . All participant undergo safety assessment monitor least 36 month last cycle alemtuzumab . Additional cycle alemtuzumab may provide discretion participant ' treat physician least 12 month interval cycle . NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS : Approximately 16 participant join study .</detailed_description>
