	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 study evaluate efficacy safety 1 mg/kg IV infusion SBC-102 ( sebelipase alfa ) administer every week patient late onset lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) deficiency ( cholesteryl ester storage disease ) . Late onset LAL Deficiency underappreciated cause cirrhosis , liver failure dyslipidemia . There currently standard treatment LAL Deficiency supportive care . Enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) may potential new treatment option LAL Deficiency patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study SBC-102 ( Sebelipase Alfa ) Patients With Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency/ ARISE ( Acid Lipase Replacement Investigating Safety Efficacy )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency ( LALD ) genetic disease characterize abnormal lipid accumulation many part body due mark decrease activity enzyme lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) . Although single disease , LALD present two major form : early onset late onset . Early onset LALD , also know Wolman Disease , characterize severe malabsorption , growth failure , hepatic failure usually fatal within first year life . The late onset form disease , also know Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease ( CESD ) , occur child adult under-appreciated cause fatty liver prominent microvesicular steatosis cirrhosis . Although natural history disease well study , serious liver complication frequently describe include early death liver transplantation . Other complication include premature atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) associate high level total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , often call `` bad '' cholesterol . The level triglyceride also high level high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol ( `` good '' cholesterol ) typically low . Current treatment mainly focus control lipid abnormality diet use lipid lowering medication . New treatment need patient LALD current treatment address aspect disease disease progression cirrhosis still occur . In pre-clinical study study patient LALD , treatment SBC-102 ( sebelipase alfa ) show produce improvement marker liver damage lipid abnormality . The purpose study examine effect use SBC-102 treat late onset LALD ( CESD ) placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blinded study affect child adult .</detailed_description>
