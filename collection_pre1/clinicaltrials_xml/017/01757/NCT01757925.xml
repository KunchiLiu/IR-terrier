	<brief_summary>Recently , researcher interested use game play , mechanic psychology health-related engagement behavior change . While initial study show increase health knowledge and/or behavior gaming , remain concern vehicle change associate perceive sedentary behavior ( 6 ) . More recently , commercially available game device able directly promote physical activity new set `` kinetic controller '' add game experience . UHG plan evaluate recent kinetic controller technology context second iteration JOIN ( describe ) implement among pilot group overweight and/or obese child whose BMI percentile 85th . This study evaluate effect commercial controller-free Exercise Gaming Entertainment Experience ( EGEE ) physical activity level context weight management program approximately 70 child age 6 to12 . The study compare difference physical activity level 16 week two group child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Center Health Reform Modernization UHG compare level physical activity , assess accelerometry , among child randomly assign WMA WM+E group . Specific aims evaluation : - Compare two group change daily minute physical activity ( mild , moderate vigorous ) session 1 , 8 15 , respectively ( Sessions typically one week part . Due holiday schedule , may lapse two week session ) . - Compare two group change daily minute sedentary behavior session 1 , 8 15 , respectively - Compare two group change relative weight ( weight , BMI percentile , BMI z-score ) session 1 , 8 , 16 week , respectively - Compare two group measure program satisfaction 1 , 8 , 16 week , respectively Participation post session one session require order eligible study requirement include : - A signed consent/ assent parent child . - The child must able participate physical activity similar exercise gaming - The family must TV/monitor support Microsoft Kinect - The family must internet connection home The family 's decision participate study affect child's'/ parent 's overall ability fully participate JOIN Program . All JOIN program material whether JOIN participant agree study . All aspect study conduct outside standard class time . Interested eligible participant schedule attend study visit immediately first JOIN class . During study visit , write informed consent/assent parent/child obtain . Once participant agree enroll consented/assented he/she inform study group he/she randomly assign . There two option : 1 ) weight management alone 2 ) weight management plus exercise gaming entertainment experience . Randomization occur group level ( i.e. , consented/assented child Wed 5 p group ) . Classes randomize pair 2 base enrollment . Treatment JOIN consist 16 weekly Core in-person group session follow 8 monthly mastery group session . While JOIN Program continue one year , study occur first 16 week . YMCA session last 75 minute include weight assessment child prior session . The group lead YMCA facilitator . The topic first 16 session list . Child Activity Monitor . At session 1 , 8 , 15 actigraph distribute participate child group 1 2 . Each child wear 1 week ( 7 day ) waking hour , return next session . An activity monitor provide feedback participant provide objective measure physical activity ( mild , moderate , vigorous ) well sedentary behavior download data . The GT3XE Triaxial Activity Monitor w/Extended MemoryÂ® ( produce Actigraph ) small , omni-directional accelerometer ( Actigraph ) , already approve FDA measure subject 's physical activity , energy expenditure level . The activity monitor ( Actigraph ) small , 1 inch 1 inch , device wear hip level attach adjustable belt ( also provide study ) . The belt worn clothing .</detailed_description>
