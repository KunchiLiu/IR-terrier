	<brief_summary>Cabazitaxel administer 20 mg/m2 IV 1 hour every 3 week , standard administration dose schedule . This application non-labeled indication cabazitaxel inform future drug development gastroesophageal malignancy , docetaxel remain approve first line agent , routinely use due excessive toxicity marginal efficacy . At conclusion study , hope demonstrate activity single agent cabazitaxel refractory gastric cancer , preferential activity one gastric cancer subtypes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Cabazitaxel Refractory Metastatic Gastric Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior initiate protocol therapy , patient undergo screen evaluation , do within 30 day protocol initiation unless otherwise note . Patients taxane naïve assign arm A patient prior taxane therapy assign Arm B . Each arm analyze separately primary study endpoint 3 month progression free survival rate ( PFS ) , define time start treatment date disease progression death . Cabazitaxel administer 20 mg/m2 IV 1 hour every 3 week . In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( ) , treatment may continue disease progression ; intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment ; unacceptable adverse event ( ) ; patient decides withdraw ; general specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . Patients follow 6 month removal study death , whichever occur first . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event follow resolution stabilization adverse event .</detailed_description>
