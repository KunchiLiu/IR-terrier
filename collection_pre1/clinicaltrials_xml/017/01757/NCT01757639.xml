	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety toxicity associate administration ipilimumab term dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , maximally-tolerated dose ( MTD ) cohort patient high risk myelodysplastic syndrome fail hypomethylating therapy , patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) underwent induction therapy plan intensive chemotherapy . ( Dose-escalation ) II . Determine optimal dose ipilimumab dose-expansion phase trial . ( Dose-escalation ) III . Better define immunologic profile associate ipilimumab use term regulatory T-cells ( T-regs ) dynamic change 2 separate cohort myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) AML patient optimal dose level . ( Dose-expansion ) IV . Obtain preliminary efficacy data ipilimumab term complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , hematological improvement ( HI ) cohort . ( Dose-expansion ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define immunologic profile associate ipilimumab use term T-regs dynamic change different dose level . ( Dose-escalation ) II . Define toxicity profile ipilimumab optimal dose patient cohort . ( Dose-expansion ) III . Obtain preliminary data potential correlation note ipilimumab-induced immunologic change observe toxicity clinical response . ( Dose-expansion ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . INDUCTION : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Beginning 12 week last dose induction ipilimumab , patient receive ipilimumab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 12 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least monthly 6 month .</detailed_description>
