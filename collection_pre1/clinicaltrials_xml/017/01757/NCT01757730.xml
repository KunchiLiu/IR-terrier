	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Elastography Method Estimate Stiffness Soft Tissues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently new novel noninvasive imaging-based technique know Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) develop capable quantify stiffness soft tissue liver , spleen , kidney , heart brain , breast , aorta etc . In MRE person lay MR scanner similar MR scan . In addition , drum ( passive driver ) place body ( area close region interest ) , connect long plastic tube run outside scan room . This drum tightly strap Velcro body well contact . Then end plastic tube connect active driver produce vibration frequency range 20Hz -2kHz . These frequency vibration transfer passive driver produce vibration body . These vibration track use MR scanner produce wave image . A post-processing wave image perform obtain spatial stiffness map . Currently , MRE clinical tool ass hepatic fibrosis many institution . MRE superior many invasive technique ( i.e . biopsy , catheter base Pressure-Volume measurement ) mechanical test noninvasive perform vivo physiologic condition . MRE could make stiffness widely available could revolutionize diagnosis treatment numerous disease affect stiffness soft tissue . For example Liver : diagnosis hepatic fibrosis , Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , liver tumor etc . Heart : diagnosis diastolic dysfunction , myocardial infarction , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , contractility etc . Aorta : Aortic aneurysm , hypertension etc . This technology completely noninvasive vibrational energy way required standard . Previous experience vibration like massage body . The risk research study minimal , mean believe different would experience routine clinical visit daily life . This study make participant ' health well . It benefit research.The specific aim study MRE use noninvasive tool diagnose different disease state soft tissue . In study apply technique adult volunteer test feasibility validation technique different organ .</detailed_description>
