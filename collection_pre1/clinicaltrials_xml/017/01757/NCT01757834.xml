	<brief_title>Shear Wave Ultrasound Elastography Noninvasive Diagnosis Thyroid Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid nodule common medical problem . With wide use various image modality , incidentally detect thyroid nodule become common . However nodules benign small proportion 5-10 % malignant . With increase number nodule detect , evaluation thyroid nodules present diagnostic challenge since image modality use evaluation present , i.e. , ultrasound ( US ) alone , low specificity approximately 50-70 % . In order improve specificity confidently diagnose malignancy thyroid nodule , fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy perform . In recent year , US elastography show high specificity 90- 98 % various study differentiate benign malignant nodule . US elastography work principle detect stiffness within tissue apply compression manual compression generation remote radiation force focus ultrasonic beam call shear wave . Shear Wave Ultrasound ( SWUS ) elastography objective method US elastography detect stiffness within nodule since strength shear wave generate know control . SWUS elastography show promise able noninvasively diagnose papillary carcinoma previous study involve preoperative patient . The investigator propose perform study investigate efficacy SWUS elastography diagnose malignant thyroid nodule noninvasively decrease number FNAs perform avoid FNA benign nodule . The Investigators enroll patient thyroid nodule undergo FNA biopsy surgery . We also propose compare routine US SWUS elastography combine use differentiate malignant benign nodule . The investigator hypothesize SWUS elastography use noninvasive screening tool , prior FNA , screen benign malignant nodule high level confidence reduce number biopsy future .</detailed_description>
