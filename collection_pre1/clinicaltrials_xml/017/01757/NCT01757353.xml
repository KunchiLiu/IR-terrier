	<brief_summary>The goal research study compare three harm reduction approach at-risk college student drinker . One approach provide generic risk-related information initial interview/questionnaire assessment session . A second approach use establish motivational interviewing framework ( Brief Alcohol Screening Intervention College Students ; BASICS ) provide personalized feedback follow-up session . A third approach also use BASICS , test utility personality-informed module approach inform social investment hypothesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While individual difference factor , trait self-control subjective college student role investment , appear important predictor excessive alcohol consumption relate problem , factor typically incorporate indicated prevention strategy . Indicated prevention usually focus group individual already express aspect health-related problem ( e.g. , heavy episodic drinking ) , , least , exhibit marker risk ( e.g. , early age first drink ) associate development health-related problem ( Gordon , 1987 ) . The primary aim current proposal incorporate personality-informed module exist motivational interviewing framework alcohol-related harm reduction test efficacy compare information-only approach ( i.e. , informational packet ) conventional strategy indicate prevention ( i.e. , Brief Alcohol Screening Intervention College Students , BASICS ; Dimeff et al. , 1999 ) provide evidence reduce risk alcohol-related problem randomize control trial ( Borsari &amp; Carey , 2000 ; 2005 ) . Motivational interviewing common technique use address ambivalence and/or resistance behavioral change . Motivational interview commonly use context health-related behavior , excessive alcohol consumption , individual might experience serious consequence ( e.g. , drive intoxicate ) , may still risk problem ( Miller &amp; Rollnick , 2002 ) . In motivational interviewing , tone collaboration attentiveness consider critical success interaction . The primary goal guide individual toward increased motivation change ( actual behavioral change ) responsive desire concern individual relates change , individual commit even modest change goal ( e.g. , consume beverage reduce alcohol volume situation know high-risk , rather favorite , high alcohol-by-volume beverage ) . Motivational interview well-suited accommodate personality-informed module change due emphasis individual 's unique profile factor . In BASICS , harm reduction approach use inform assessment content initial assessment session , well follow-up feedback session ( Dimeff et al. , 1999 ) . Consistent research show continuum problem alcohol externalize behavior ( Bogg &amp; Finn , 2010 ; Krueger et al. , 2002 ) , harm reduction approach emphasize movement toward reduce risk harm , regardless impact , positive movement , even person might farther along continuum harm ( Marlatt , 1998 ) . The current proposal seek test augmentation harm reduction approach BASICS normative enhancement approach derive social investment hypothesis Cumulative Continuity Model personality development ( Roberts &amp; Caspi , 2003 ) . According social investment hypothesis , process commitment normative role , college student , `` think exact form social control role demand embed context call individual act responsibility probity '' ( Roberts &amp; Caspi , 2003 ; p. 203 ) . To extent commitment , investment , involvement college student role foster , concomitant increase trait self-control expect well , independent harm reduction effect . As suggested finding describe , effect increase subjective college student role investment could deflect risky trajectory alcohol-related problem - effect could amplify correspond increase trait self-control . This normative enhancement ( NE ) approach posit particularly useful individual recognize steadfastly resistant even minor harm reduction effort convey motivational interviewing framework BASICS . The strategy normative enhancement approach capitalize individual 's goal involvement roles - especially role , college student , nominally voluntary nature .</detailed_description>
