	<detailed_description>Male undergoing elective AMC recruit surgical outpatient department Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital , Uganda . Patient age , marital status , smoke history motive seek AMC record participant . The investigator perform block randomization study day . Consenting participant select opaque envelope box randomization SR FG group . All AMC procedure perform locally-trained surgeon perform 100 prior FG procedure prior experience SR procedure . A study surgeon perform procedure hospital operate theatre . In study group , participant clean povidone iodine solution drape sterile fashion . Local anesthesia administer dorsal penile nerve penile ring block use 3mg/kg 1 % lidocaine . The surgeon measure participant SR group determine ring size . Patients suitable ring size available crossed FG group , remain SR group intention treat ( ITT ) analyse . An assistant measure operative time use stopwatch . For SR group , time begin ring begin fit , cease foreskin excise . For FG group , time begin first incision cease final suture complete . Patients discharge day procedure , provide sterile gauze dressing , inform change twice daily first follow-up appointment . All pre- post-operative assessment perform lead investigator one hour procedure , 3rd , 7th , 14th 21st post-operative day . The investigator measure incidence rate outcomes estimate relative risk SR versus FG group fit Poisson regression model robust error . The investigator compare time heal Kaplan-Meier survival curve measure difference group use likelihood ratio test . All analyse initially perform use ITT analysis , repeat as-treated analysis reallocate 7 participant cross FG group .</detailed_description>
