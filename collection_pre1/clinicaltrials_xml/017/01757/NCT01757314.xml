	<brief_summary>When surgery perform general anesthesia , catheter place vein administer drug saline . During major operation , additional catheter place artery order measure blood pressure closely withdraw blood sample frequent interval various laboratory test . This arterial catheter usually place feeling patient 's artery wrist insert guide-needle blind fashion . This procedure , time , lead delay failure due inability feel arterial pulsation well either due patient ' anatomy anesthetic effect . This study determine whether train Anesthesiology Residents use ultrasound technology application identify artery prevent problem associate conventional palpation technique . Our find lead well safer anesthetic management patient present major surgical procedure . Furthermore , find help u introduce education train ultrasound-guided arterial catheter placement Residency Program . The investigator propose follow anesthesia resident course 3 year assess skill level palpation ultrasound technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This update study previous IRB-approved research ( 0120070296 ) terminate prior conclusion principal investigator terminate employment UNDNJ . An arterial catheter routinely place immediately follow induction anesthesia , major operative procedure , order measure blood pressure continuously , perform frequent blood-gas analysis withdraw blood repeat laboratory testing . The arterial catheter traditionally place blindly palpate radial artery patient . This way place radial artery catheter encounter delay failure due condition obesity , arteriosclerosis , arterial spasm anesthesia-induced hypotension . Our study compare performance Anesthesiology Residents place arterial catheter traditional palpation-guided technique ultrasound-guided technique training ultrasound usage . The comparison utilize follow parameter : - Time take successfully place catheter - Number attempt need place catheter - Number puncture site change encounter - Failure rate resident technique - The need replacement catheter surgery The data collection do independent observer , member anesthesia care team research team . The Residents perform catheter placement member research team access data . If Resident fail place catheter , attend anesthesiologist rescue place arterial catheter method choice . In previous study , trend toward reduced failure rate decrease time insertion ultrasound technique . In study , investigator introduce research first-year Residents repeat exercise second third year train longitudinal fashion ass progress anesthesia training . The investigator plan enroll eight resident first-year class . Each resident perform eight arterial catheter placement technique . In addition , compare previous study , advance ultrasound machine use provide good visualization radial artery .</detailed_description>
