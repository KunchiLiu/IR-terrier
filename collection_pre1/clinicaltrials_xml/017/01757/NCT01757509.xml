The objective study : - To compare functional exercise tolerance , balance , motor performance quality life Parkinson 's disease participating set dancing class , use follow validated outcome measure : Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale 3 , Berg Balance Scale , The Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire The Six-Minute Walk Test . - To compare functional exercise tolerance , balance , motor performance quality life Parkinson 's disease participating set dancing class receive usual care . - To assess effect intervention care giver burden use Zarit Care Giver Burden Interview . Participants , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , randomly assign group receive set dance intervention along usual care control group continue usual care . Participants assess week intervention period begin week intervention period end use valid reliable outcome measure .</detailed_description>
