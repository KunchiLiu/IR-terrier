	<brief_title>Phase II Study Tocilizumab Patients With Glucocorticoid-refractory Acute GVHD After Allogeneic Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial test drug call Tocilizumab ( monoclonal antibody ) first line therapy subject steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease ( acute GVHD ) undergo bone marrow transplant . The purpose study test safety efficacy Tocilizumab differ dose schedule . There 2 phase study . Both phase include subject acute GVHD respond steroid treatment . Subjects enrol Phase IIp receive Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every week every 2 week . Subjects enrol Phase II receive one two dose schedule determine result Phase IIp . Depending dose assign , subject receive Tocilizumab every week every 2 week total 8 dos . The study medication may interrupt , withhold stop different reason . However , subject ask follow periodically one year start Tocilizumab treatment .</detailed_description>
