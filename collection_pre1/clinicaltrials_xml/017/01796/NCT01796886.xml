	<brief_summary>The pupillary examination major component clinical examination monitor brain-damaged patient intensive care . The occurrence abnormal size pupillary reactivity prognostic factor poor neurological outcome indicator neurological status degradation . To date , monitor pupil clinical . The subjectivity measure , lack reproducibility definition abnormality remain many obstacle development monitor early neurological deterioration . The recent development pupillometer electronics allow assessment responsiveness calibrate light stimulus . It offer reliable reproducible measure pupil diameter . The pupillometers fund association `` Gueules Cassées `` . This study aim establish relationship abnormal pupillary reactivity detection electronic pupillometer deterioration neurological status patient brain-damaged intensive-care unit ( ICU ) . This consider clinically relevant define low Glasgow Coma Score least 2 point 2 hour involve therapeutic action . If relationship demonstrate , temporal relationship data pupillometry patient 's neurological status remain establish precisely . This particularly relevant neurosurgical context aim define status electronic pupillometer intensive care also emergency room service , neurovascular unit pre-hospital care . Therefore investigator compare pupillometry data two patient group , define accordingly appearance absence neurological aggravation first 5 day treatment intensive care , time-frame define maximum risk period patient brain damage . The primary endpoint represent estimated area ROC curve correspond last measure change pupil size onset neurological deterioration bad fifth day non-aggravated . Thus investigator propose conduct prospective trial , aim record diagnostic value pupillary reactivity electronic pupillometer monitor neurological aggravation brain damage patient ICU . The duration follow-up subject exceed 5 day . The statistical analysis require recruitment 90 patient , set length inclusion 14 month .</brief_summary>
