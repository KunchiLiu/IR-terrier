	<brief_summary>Compared end-stage heart failure , patient 's situation usually greatly improved heart transplant ( HTx ) , exercise capacity remain sub-normal , also long-term , range 50 70 % study . While effective rehabilitation , include regular exercise , consider effective tool improve health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) prognosis cardiac patient general , knowledge effect different rehabilitation program among HTx recipient limit . Exercise training consider one central part rehabilitation , mode exercise use different study vary considerably . It document high intensity interval training ( HIT ) superior effect compare train moderate intensity cardiac heart failure patient . In contrast , HTx recipient denervated heart , HIT consider unphysiological . However , investigator recently demonstrate highly beneficial effect exercise capacity , muscle strength , body composition , reduce progression cardiac allograft vasculopathy HRQoL among long-term HTx recipient . In present study investigator want test hypothesis systematic aerobic exercise high intensity improve exercise capacity also newly transplant recipient , secondarily give favourable effect heart , peripheral circulation well HRQoL .</brief_summary>
