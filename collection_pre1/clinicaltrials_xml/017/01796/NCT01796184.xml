	<brief_summary>Background . Obesity , insulin resistance type 2 diabetes closely associate chronic inflammation characterize abnormal cytokine production . Some author find discordance glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) measure glycemic control , suggest `` glycation gap '' , define difference HbA1c concentration predict fructosamine concentration , could explain excess interindividual variation HbA1c . The present study aim examine association inflammation , sociodemographic ( age , gender ) lifestyle factor ( diet , exercise , alcohol , tobacco consumption ) , common disease . In addition , also examine level blood glucose , HbA1c , fructosamine `` glycation gap '' determine prevalence `` high glycators '' general adult population association lifestyles prevalent disease . Methods . Selection random sample general adult population single municipality ( A-Estrada , Pontevedra , Spain ) , stratify age . The initial sampling include 3,500 subject . Considering approximate 67 % participation rate , final study population would include 2,000 individual . The standard workup include structured questionnaire , skin prick test , periodontal examination , psychological test , physical examination blood determination allow categorization participant term basic demographic , profession , education level , socioeconomic level , quality life , physical activity , diet , alcohol consumption smoking , atopy , obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , liver disease . We determine blood level inflammation marker , HBA1c , fructosamine glucose . We collect urine sample microalbuminuria determination . In addition , blood drawn store Biobank Hospital . One half participant ( ~1000 individual ) undergo continuous glucose monitoring . The design cross-sectional , follow longitudinal study use population registry determination event ( mortality ) . Discussion . This comprehensive study general adult population provide excellent opportunity determine serum concentration inflammation glycation marker vary widely age , sex , common habit , metabolic abnormality , chronic disease . The finding study also help find relationship glucose profile HbA1c fructosamine concentration diet inflammation marker . Keywords : Inflammation , glycation , glycated hemoglobin , glycation gap , continuous glucose monitoring , obesity , allergy , periodontal disease , depression , metabolic disease .</brief_summary>
