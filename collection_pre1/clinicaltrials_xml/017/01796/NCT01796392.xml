	<brief_summary>The purpose research study investigational medical device design produce lung volume reduction diseased area lung patient severe emphysema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used Treatment Emphysema ( LIBERATE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Pulmonx Zephyr Endobronchial Valve ( EBV ) implantable bronchial valve intend decrease volume target region lung . It indicate treatment patient severe emphysema . The EBV place diseased region lung use bronchoscopy . Bronchoscopy way access lung use small tube camera end . As diseased region lung shrink size , healthy region may expand function efficiently , result improve breathing . The LIBERATE Study clinical trial two group . Participants assign random 'Treatment ' group 'Control ' group . The 'Treatment ' group receive Zephyr Endobronchial Valve ( EBV ) combination optimal medical therapy . The 'Control ' group receive optimal medical therapy alone . For every three participant study , two go 'Treatment ' group one go 'Control ' group . It hypothesize placement EBV , lung function improve compare standard medical therapy alone .</detailed_description>
