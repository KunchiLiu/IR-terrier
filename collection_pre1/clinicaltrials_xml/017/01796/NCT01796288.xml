	<brief_summary>This multi-center randomized control Phase II clinical trial . Patients oligometastatic stage IV ( number distant metastases ≤ 5 ) non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer treat second-line erlotinib150mg daily 3 month clinical benefit ( free-from progression ) randomize ( stratified accord smoking status different research center ) radiotherapy group ( n = 100 ) non-radiotherapy group ( n = 100 ) . Radiotherapy group ( experimental group ) patient start simultaneously radiotherapy gross tumor soon randomization ; non-radiotherapy group ( control group ) receive radiotherapy gross tumor . Erlotinib continuously use disease progression unbearable adverse effect , subsequently salvage therapy determine investigator . The primary endpoint PFS .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Has sign inform consent ; 2 . Male female age 18 year old ; 3 . Histologically cytologically identify nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer ; 4 . PS score 02 ; 5 . Stage IV patient distant metastasis ( accord late AJCC/UICC lung cancer staging , upper neck lymph node belong distant metastasis ; ipsilateral/contralateral mediastinal lymph node , supraclavicular low neck lymph node belong local regional area include distant metastasis ) , occur disease progression receive course systemic chemotherapy , n't complete plan course firstline chemotherapy intolerance refuse continue treatment ; 6 . Received secondline erlotinib treatment ; 7 . The patient take erlotinib 3 month efficacy evaluation find clinical benefit ( CR+PR+SD ) ; 8 . Metastatic NSCLC distant metastases number ≤ 5 ( metastasis organ , number count separate metastatic focus ) long diameter metastatic focus CT &gt; 1cm , brain ( include parenchyma meninges ) metastasis , malignant pleural/pericardial effusion , abdominal effusion allow ; 9 . Have never receive local treatment , include surgery , radiation therapy , radiofrequency ablation primary distant metastasis ; 10 . Patients must receive systemic PETCT examination treatment erlotinib , accurately identify status patient distant metastasis ; 11 . The diagnosis bone liver metastasis : 1 . On basis clinical symptom , image support necessary clinical diagnosis bone metastases ; clinical symptom absent , two imaging support bone metastases necessary clinical diagnosis bone metastasis ; adjacent bone metastasis ( two adjacent vertebral metastasis ) consider single metastasis . 2 . MRI enhance CT confirmation need liver metastasis diagnosis ; 12 . Have never receive targeted drug treatment EGFR inhibition ; 13 . If metastasis organ ≤ 4 amount metastatic focus ≤ 5 , determine radiation therapist research group judge patient tolerate positive focus ( include primary metastatic focus ) receive radiotherapy , radiotherapy dose select treat physician accord patient ' condition several regimen include conventional split curative dos palliative dos , hypofractionated radiotherapy ( detail please refer radiation therapy section ) ; 14 . Organ function level must meet following requirement : 1 . Bone marrow : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 × 109/L , platelet ≥ 80 × 109/L , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/L ; 2 . Liver : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( liver metastasis exist , ALT , AST ≤ 5 time upper limit normal allow ) ; 3 . Kidney : serum creatinine ≤ 2 time upper limit normal creatinine clearance ≥ 45mL/min ; 15 . For female patient : must natural menopause , surgical menopause , use medical allow contraceptive method treatment within 3 month treatment completion ; serum urine pregnancy test must negative ; must n't lactation . For male patient : surgical sterilization , take contraceptive measure treatment within 3 month treatment completion . 1 . The pathological type squamous cell carcinoma , mixed small cell component nonsmall cell lung cancer ; 2 . With brain metastasis regardless parenchymal meningeal metastasis ; 3 . Malignant pleural effusion , pericardial effusion peritoneal effusion ; 4 . The long diameter metastatic focus CT &lt; 1cm , amount metastatic focus &gt; 5 ; 5 . Metastases appear within organ simultaneously ; 6 . The efficacy evaluation erlotinib treatment 3 month show PD ( progression disease ) ; 7 . Local treatment use primary distant metastatic focus ; 8 . Radiation therapist think patient could n't tolerate/receive radiotherapy focus ; 9 . Has previously suffer interstitial lung disease , druginduced interstitial lung disease , active interstitial lung disease clinical evidence ; 10 . Chest CT find idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ; 11 . Patients multiple pulmonary bulla , chronic lung disease , acute lung infection ; 12 . With chronic toxicity induce previous anticancer treatment , undimunished high CTCAE level 2 ; 13 . Diagnosed accompanied malignant disease ( except basal cell carcinoma cervical carcinoma situ ) past five year ; 14 . According judgment investigator , serious uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g . heart , liver , kidney disease ) active infection ; 15 . Combined use phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampicin , phenobarbital , St. John 's wort ; 16 . Naïve patient never receive chemotherapy ; 17 . With previously clear history neurological psychiatric disorder , dementia ; 18 . Pregnancy lactate patient ; 19 . Patients receive antitumor medicine study .</criteria>
