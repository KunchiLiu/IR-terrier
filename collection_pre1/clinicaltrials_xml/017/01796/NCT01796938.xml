	<criteria>Subject inform give ample time opportunity think his/her participation give his/her write informed consent Subject willing able comply trial requirement Subject male female Caucasian , 18 70 year age ( inclusive ) If female , subject nonchildbearing potential ( postmenopausal hysterectomized ) use medically adequate contraception If female childbearing potential , subject negative pregnancy test Subject Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 20 34 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) Subject healthy without clinically relevant cardiovascular , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic , metabolic , endocrine , neurological , psychiatric abnormality detect Eligibility Assessment ( EA ) Subjects renal impairment also fulfill follow inclusion criterion : Subject clinically relevant cardiovascular endocrine finding EA Subject renal impairment . The subject assign 1 follow treatment group accord Creatinine Clearance ( CLCr ) value determine 2 7 day prior dose : Group 2 : 80 mL/min &gt; CLCr ≥ 50 mL/min ( subject mild renal impairment ) Group 3 : 50 mL/min &gt; CLCr ≥ 30 mL/min ( subject moderate renal impairment ) Group 4 : CLCr &lt; 30 mL/min ( subject severe renal impairment , dialysis 2 week EA end trial ) Inclusion criterion Group 5 : Subject inform give ample time opportunity think his/her participation give his/her write informed consent Subject willing able comply trial requirement Subject male female Caucasian , 18 70 year age ( inclusive ) If female , subject nonchildbearing potential ( postmenopausal hysterectomized ) use medically adequate contraception If female childbearing potential , subject negative pregnancy test Subject BMI 20 34 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) Subject clinically relevant cardiovascular endocrine finding EA Subject endstage renal disease ( CLCr &lt; 15 mL/min , determine approximately 2 7 day first dose ) treat extracorporal hemodialysis least 4 month Healthy subject : Subject previously participate trial Subject participate another trial investigational product within last 3 month currently participate another trial investigational product Subject donate blood comparable blood loss ( &gt; 500 mL ) within last 3 month prior EA Subject smoke 5 cigarette per day do within 6 month prior commencement trial Subject history chronic alcohol drug abuse within last 6 month prior commencement trial Subject consume 40 g alcohol/day ( amount correspond 1 L beer/day 0.5 L wine/day 120 mL liquor/day ) Subject positive test alcohol ( urine breath test ) drug ( urine test ) Subject clinically relevant change electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , second thirddegree atrioventricular ( AV ) block , prolongation QRS complex 120 m correct QT ( QTc ) interval &gt; 430 m ( male subject ) &gt; 450 m ( female subject ) Subject history present condition clinically relevant respiratory cardiovascular disorder , eg , cardiac insufficiency , coronary heart disease , hypertension , arrhythmia , tachyarrhythmia , status myocardial infarction Subject history present condition psychic abnormality , psychiatric neurologic illness , autonomic neuropathy , opinion Investigator , could jeopardize would compromise subject 's ability participate trial Subject history present condition seizure disorder Subject history present condition malignancy Subject history present condition renal disorder ( albuminuria , chronic infection ) renal impairment Subject history present condition Diabetes Mellitus thyroid dysfunction , especially Hyperthyreosis , endocrine disorder Subject clinically relevant allergy Subject know suspected drug hypersensitivity , particular trial medication Subject take concomitant medication currently within 2 week prior first day dose ( exception oral contraceptive Paracetamol [ maximum allow dose : 1000 mg/dose ] , allow 48 hour prior dose ) ; exception could make Investigator sponsor jointly consider medication acceptable Subject test positive human immunodeficiency virus 1/2 antibody ( HIV1/2Ab ) , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , hepatitis C virus antibody ( HCVAb ) Subject clinically relevant abnormality physical examination vital sign measurement ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg &lt; 100 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg &lt; 60 mmHg , pulse rate &gt; 100 beat per minute ( bpm ) &lt; 50 bpm ) Subject clinically relevant deviation norm clinical chemistry , hematology , urinalysis evaluation Exclusion criterion Groups 24 : Exclusion criterion 1 12 healthy subject also apply subject renal impairment Subject clinically relevant allergy Subject know suspected drug hypersensitivity , particular trial medication Subject take concomitant medication currently within 2 week prior dose could interfere investigational product Subject test positive HIV1/2Ab , HBsAg , HCVAb Subject clinically relevant abnormality physical examination vital sign measurement ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg &lt; 100 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg , pulse rate &gt; 100 bpm &lt; 60 bpm ) Subject clinically relevant deviation norm clinical chemistry , hematology urinalysis evaluation expect subject renal impairment , eg , hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL Exclusion criterion Group 5 : Exclusion criterion 1 12 healthy subject also apply subject Group 5 Subject clinically relevant allergy Subject know suspected drug hypersensitivity , particular trial medication Subject test positive HIV1/2Ab , HBsAg , HCVAb Subject take concomitant medication might interfere investigational product currently within 2 week prior dose Subject clinically relevant abnormality physical examination vital sign measurement ( systolic blood pressure &gt;
