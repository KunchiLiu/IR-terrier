	<detailed_description>The study hypothesize assume cardiovascular performance reserve physiologically detectable continuously monitored physiological control ( reserve control ) yet discover . High reserve rest characterize healthy person low reserve rest characterize low functional capacity e.g . heart failure . The low reserve severe morbidity . The reserve decrease reversibly aerobic activity may reach exhaustion threshold assume reserve control induce reversible fatigue dyspnea dissolve activity decrease . The reserve may estimate CVRI ( cardiovascular reserve index ) compute algorithm compose physiological measurement take patient visit ( compose blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , central venous pressure estimation , weight , height gender . In study investigator evaluate CVRI capability prediction functional capacity comparison clinical evaluation visit ( cross sectional comparison ) .</detailed_description>
