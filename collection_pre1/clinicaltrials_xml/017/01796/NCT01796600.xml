	<brief_summary>ConeBeam scanner ( CBCT ) widely technique use dental maxillofacial imaging . Patients set sit lay position , Newtom 5G CBCT allow analysis distal appendicular skeleton . The investigator ' hypothesis cone-beam scanner could detect characterize fracture extremities similarly multidetector CT ( MDCT ) . 150 patient 18 year require CT scan suspect distal limb fracture preoperative assessment enrol . The primary endpointis base ability cone-beam scanner properly characterize type fracture use classification derive Maurice E. Müller ( AO ) classification . Secondary endpoint concern depiction fracture , assessment soft tissue near fracture , quality image , inter intra-operator reproducibility tolerance patient examination . Patients MDCT consider reference exam , CBCT . Exams anonymized read twice two trained radiologist 3-6 week interval . The inter-observer agreement diagnosis fracture type two technique evaluate kappa coefficient . The evaluation diagnostic performance achieve studying sensitivity , specificity , negative predictive value positive predictive value , likelihood ratio . Kappa test perform evaluate consistency characterization fracture evaluation soft tissue near fracture . A Student test perform pair data distribution normal , Wilcoxon test . To assess patient 's tolerance , percentage ( painful , painful ) calculate technique compare use Chi2 test ( Fisher 's exact test chi apply ) .</brief_summary>
