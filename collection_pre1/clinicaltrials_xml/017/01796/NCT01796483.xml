	<brief_summary>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) remarkably improve motor function patient Parkinson disease ( PD ) . However , grow evidence suggest STN-DBS also cause executive inhibitory deficit impulsive behaviour ( Jahanshahi et al 2000 ; Schroeder et al 2002 ; Hershey et al 2004 ; Thobois et al 2007 ; Frank et al 2007 ; Ballanger et al. , 2009 ) . Despite widespread use , mechanisms action STN-DBS still unclear . Two reason might explain . 1 ) From theoretical point view , cognitive model executive control mechanisms incomplete . 2 ) From methodological point view , investigate cerebral activity STN-DBS limit technique incompatible locally implant electrode . This project rely double opportunity answer question offer recent theoretical methodological advance . First , investigation healthy subject ( Jaffard et al 2007 , 2008 , Boulinguez et al 2009 ) reveal essential function inhibitory control , far ignore , consist lock advance movement trigger process prevent undesired automatic anticipate response unattended stimulus . In word , key process executive control may act tonically stimulation occurs , call brain imaging study look proactive reactive activation . Second , recent advance EEG signal processing allow suppress electroencephalogram DBS-related artifact ( Allen et al . 2010 ) , provide tremendous opportunity use non-invasive technique high temporal resolution necessary disentangle proactive reactive brain activity . To knowledge , date study publish use EEG STN-DBS patient since Allen et al . 's paper . The first operational purpose project identify anatomo-functional origin STN-DBS-induced executive dysfunction use EEG recording classical stimulus-response task . Results expect first part project may help resolve long-lasting issue . Indeed , reactivity assess simple reaction time non-implanted patient well impulsivity STN-DBS patient know remain insensitive dopaminergic medication . Since proactive activity relate executive , inhibitory , control may support noradrenergic ( NA ) system , second purpose project test original hypothesis accord NA play central role akinesia STN-DBS side effect .</brief_summary>
