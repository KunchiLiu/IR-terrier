	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Proximal Caries Infiltration Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The hypothesis test Icon performs similarly establish prevention strategy early caries ( Oral hygiene instruction topical fluoridation ) caries arrest ; caries progression may image SFE laser optical device . Materials Methods : The investigator propose pilot study Icon vs. control include Oral Hygiene Instructions ( OHI ) topical fluoridation early caries arrest primary molar . Lesion depth perform standard-of care method , i.e . radiographs visual exam , plus novel optical device base scan fiber endoscope ( SFE ) technology laser light image early caries detection pediatric population . The investigator utilize SFE laser optical device prototype develop University Washington 's Human Photonics Lab ( HPL ) , device already human use application , include image cancer screening . Clinical Significance : This control trial ass positive effect white spot infiltration ICON may open new therapeutic strategy paediatric dentistry . Additionally , study would one first vivo dental application SFE optical device , would add novel early caries visualization technique armamentarium detect caries progression .</detailed_description>
