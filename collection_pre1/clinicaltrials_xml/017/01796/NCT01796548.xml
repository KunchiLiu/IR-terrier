	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single arm , prospective ( study follow participant forward time ) , multi-center study participant NDO . The initial dose Oxybutynin ER 10 milligram ( mg ) titrate maximum 30 mg . Dosage adjust 5-mg increment approximately 14-day interval continence achieve participant tolerate side effect . The duration participation study 12 week . The study consist 6 visit : baseline , Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 12 . Week 4 Week 8 telephone visit . Overall safety efficacy Oxybutinin ER assess well safety efficacy titration maintenance phase . The efficacy treatment assess use urodynamic parameter ( force flow urine ) clinical parameter ( void diary catheterization [ use insertion tubular device drain bladder ] schedule ) . The quality life also monitor study .</detailed_description>
