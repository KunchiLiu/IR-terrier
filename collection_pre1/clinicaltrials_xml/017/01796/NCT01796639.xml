	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate graft survival recipient survival among kidney transplant recipient China , also analyze possible factor related patient graft survival . The secondary objective evaluate several secondary outcome among kidney transplant recipient , average creatinine value , acute rejection episode , NODM , incidence BKV infection etc . At time analyze possible impact factor related secondary outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retrospective Study Long-term Survival Related Factors Among Kidney Transplant Recipients China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal transplantation choice patient end-stage renal disease . In past two decade , progress surgical procedure , medical care , immunosuppression significantly improve short-term result organ transplantation . Nevertheless , graft continue fail time , improvement immunosuppression reduce incidence acute rejection episodes minimal effect chronic allograft dysfunction late graft loss . Long-term patient 's death graft failure main limitation well performance renal transplant program . Multiple factor show affect outcome renal transplantation . These include demographic characteristic race ethnicity , pretransplantation dialysis course , time transplantationï¼Œand patient ' co morbidity . Patient response transplantation procedure ( e.g. , delayed graft function , acute rejection , acute tubular necrosis ) strongly associate long-term prognosis . In last decade , increase immunosuppressive agent therapeutic arsenal , several attempt make improve graft performance . However , majority trial aim avoid calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) -related nephrotoxicity report short-term data . Also , lack assessment role different ethiopathogenic factor lead graft damage , avoid CNI-related nephrotoxicity may oversimplification problem prevention graft attrition . There many study evaluate long-term outcome graft patient survival analyze multiple relative factor . Unfortunately , data Chinese population lack . Meanwhile , situation China somewhat different others , race , dosage immunosuppressant . A good characterization weight immune non-immune factor responsible graft damage may help u improve outcome transplant recipient . Studies derive well-designed well-performed patient registry provide real world view clinical practice , patient outcome , safety , comparative effectiveness cost effectiveness . The goal project analyze retrospective data collect disease registry , evaluate graft recipient outcomes kidney transplant relative impact factor .</detailed_description>
