Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treat different disease . It also mean FDA yet approve clofarabine disease . Clofarabine chemotherapy drug use treatment leukemia child adult . Information research study suggest drug may also effective patient LCH . The purpose study estimate response rate participant recurrent LCH clofarabine within two stratum : ) low-risk participant disease reactivation , b ) high-risk participant risk-organ involvement . Other purpose estimate progression-free survival clofarabine treatment , estimate survival participant refractory multi-system LCH risk organ involvement treat clofarabine describe toxicity clofarabine participant LCH .</brief_summary>
