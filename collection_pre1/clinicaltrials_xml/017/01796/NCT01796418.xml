	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy , lead cause end-stage renal disease many country , characterize high cardiovascular mortality morbidity even early course disease . In addition , cardiovascular complication common cause death patient . Thus , early detection appropriate intervention highly common critical complication consider play important role management disease . In regard , much interest focus early marker predict arterial disease clinically apparent cardiovascular disease . Recently , glow evidence suggest arterial stiffness assess pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) may serve surrogate marker future cardiovascular disease . In fact , increase PWV know independently associate diabetic nephropathy type 2 diabetes . Beraprost sodium ( BPS ) stable orally active prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) analogue potent vasodilatory anti-platelet effect . Also , BPS suggest improve micro-vascular circulation reduction red blood cell deformability . In addition , recent study demonstrate BPS improve endothelial function increase endothelial nitric oxide synthesis NO synthase gene transcription . These beneficial effect BPS know reduce PWV patient prone cardiovascular disease elderly , hypertension , history cerebral infarction . However , effect BPS arterial stiffness patient diabetic nephropathy remain elusive . Our study address effect BPS arterial stiffness PWV patient diabetic nephropathy .</brief_summary>
