	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death New Zealand ( 40 % death ) . 37 % New Zealanders suffer high blood pressure ( World Health Organisation 2008 figure ) , well establish modifiable risk factor CVD . Above 115/75 mmHg , CVD risk double increment 20/10 mmHg blood pressure raise . An increase BMI waist circumference associate increase blood pressure . The leaf olive plant rich plant compound know polyphenols . This particular group polyphenols know secoiridoids , also present olive oil olive though low concentration , find family plant . Diets high polyphenols find reduce risk chronic disease . Studies show consumption phenolic-rich olive leaf extract ( OLE ) significantly reduce blood pressure individual suffer high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , magnitude effect comparable commonly use antihypertensive drug . In trial OLE also result improved blood lipid ( reduction total LDL cholesterol triacylglycerides ) also reduce CVD risk . One study test effect OLE individual mild prehypertension ( i.e . systolic blood pressure range 121-139 mmHg diastolic blood pressure range 81-89 mmHg take antihypertensive medication ) also find improvement . OLE indicate potential improve cardiovascular risk marker vascular function , inflammation , platelet aggregation , oxidation LDL glucose tolerance however much evidence derive animal , vitro ex vivo study well design control human study require verify finding applicable human . Therefore OLE supplementation may useful dietary strategy reduce CVD risk cohort overweight prehypertensive individual . The aim study determine effect OLE intake blood pressure CVD risk marker overweight subject mild hypertension link study outcomes presence OLE phenolic urine</brief_summary>
