	<brief_summary>It believe average person eighty year old life span walk distance world twice lifetime . The foot comprise specialized fat pad provide shock absorption protection breakdown . With walk human however , foot fat pad breakdown inevitable . Trauma foot compound diabetic patient due many reason : loss protective sensation secondary neuropathy , reduce skin hydration , decrease soft tissue elasticity , elevate blood sugar increase body weight name . Increased foot pressure decrease fat pad protection main contributing factor callus formation , foot pain ulcer formation . Fat graft cosmetic reconstructive procedure use sometimes help improve one 's soft tissue thickness , shape integrity . Autologous fat transplantation procedure use patient 's fat take small liposuction tube , area substantial amount fat ( i.e . abdomen thighs ) transfer fat atrophied ( decreased worn ) area ( case , foot ) . The investigator perform research effort decrease foot pressure activity increase soft tissue thickness sole foot one 's lifetime . Ultimately could help reduce foot pain , callus formation even ulcer formation . The goal research see whether fat graft help decrease prevalence aforementioned foot complication . The investigator hope use one 's fat tissue , may longer duration relief use method . This randomized , cross-over design study . Randomized mean patient enrol chance ( like flip coin ) one two group first part study . Cross-over mean , first part study one year , patient move opposite group . One group receive fat grafting procedure one year follow ( year A pathway ) receive standard care treatment patient 's primary podiatrist first year ( year B pathway ) . After first year , patient switch opposite year pathway next 12 month . Participation study last approximately 24-26 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fat Grafting Pedal Fat Pad Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology plantar fat pad atrophy may age-related , due abnormal foot mechanic , steroid use , collagen vascular disease . Displacement atrophy fat pad lead osseous prominence forefoot may see painful skin lesion . Disease state , diabetes , may loss soft tissue integrity . Fat pad atrophy , regardless etiology , may result significant pain , epidermal lesion , metatarsalgia . In sensate patient , pain lead emotional physical pain , lead productivity financial losses.1 It well document plantar pressure directly correlate plantar tissue thickness , loss plantar fat fundamental mechanism pressure related foot disorders.2,3 Autologous fat graft area plantar fat pad atrophy may reduce plantar pressure , thus serve treatment metatarsalgia , corn callus prevention , possibly ulcer prevention diabetic . Plastic surgeon , significant skill fat grafting , make significant contribution . Current treatment modality fat pad atrophy include silicone injection , fat injection , temporary filler ; however , objective study use autologous fat perform . Approximately 30 adult experience pain fat pad atrophy , option participate . Through randomize , control , cross-over study , patient receive autologous fat grafting , receive standard care podiatric treatment , cross-over fat grafting treatment year . Through pedobarograph ultrasound assessment , focal pedal pressure tissue thickness follow treatment document two year . The investigator hypothesize fat graft area increase pedal pressure help decrease foot pressure gait increase soft tissue thickness foot pad , ultimately reduce pain . The investigator also hope demonstrate use autologous fat evidence-based fat transfer technique , result may durable . This pilot study help build new collaborative effort Foot Ankle Surgery , Podiatry Plastic Surgery , combine expertise foot biomechanics reconstructive fat grafting .</detailed_description>
