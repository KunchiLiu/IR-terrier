	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . In study , paclitaxel trastuzumab combine pertuzumab `` investigational '' preoperative treatment inflammatory breast cancer . Trastuzumab give total 12 month treatment HER2 positive breast cancer . This study also add pertuzumab trastuzumab drug give total 12 month ; combination also `` investigational '' . `` Investigational '' mean pertuzumab study . It also mean although FDA approve pertuzumab preoperative use treat breast cancer , thoroughly study combination paclitaxel trastuzumab preoperative treatment inflammatory breast cancer . It FDA approve specific use advance breast cancer HER2 positive . Pertuzumab antibody , protein attack foreign substance body . Pertuzumab block function HER2 protein like trastuzumab . However , pertuzumab bind different part HER2 receptor stop cancer cell grow . This drug use treatment advance breast cancer HER2 positive , combine trastuzumab chemotherapy study . Information research study suggest pertuzumab may help kill cancer cell breast enable undergo mastectomy . The addition pertuzumab may also help reduce chance cancer recurrence . In research study , combine pertuzumab paclitaxel trastuzumab preoperative therapy determine response cancer remain breast time mastectomy . In addition , combine trastuzumab pertuzumab total 12 month look see whether combination reduces chance cancer return . Another goal research study determine whether develop way identify tumor respond well study treatment . We research test tumor tissue , study treatment . These test may help doctor understand study treatment may work treat type breast cancer . In future , test may help u find way help match patient drug likely work specific tumor treatment begin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree take part study ask undergo screen test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . The screening process include follow : medical history , performance status , physical examination , scan x-ray , blood sample , blood pregnancy test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion able participate research study . Before begin study treatment undergo tumor biopsy photograph tumor take assess response tumor study treatment . On first day study treatment ( Week 1 , Day 1 ) trastuzumab pertuzumab , receive intravenous infusion trastuzumab 90 minute , follow 60 minute observation period . If trastuzumab infusion tolerate , receive rest study treatment , pertuzumab . This also give intravenous infusion 60 minute observe 60 minute . Thus , total duration infusion observation period first dose study treatment ( Week 1 , Day 1 ) 5 hour . If drug well tolerate Week 1 , duration infusion trastuzumab pertuzumab may shorten subsequent dos . Prior start Week 2 , undergo second research biopsy breast . The biopsy perform either prior Week 2 , Day 8 day . You receive infusion trastuzumab begin chemotherapy . If infusion trastuzumab tolerate Week 1 , Day 1 , infusion time reduce 30 minute . You pre-medicated drug reduce chance sensitivity reaction paclitaxel . This take approximately 30 minute . The paclitaxel give intravenous infusion 60 minute . If tolerate paclitaxel infusion , pre-medication change doctor . The pertuzumab give every 3 week begin Week 1 continue paclitaxel administration complete . Trastuzumab give weekly begin Week 1 continue paclitaxel administration complete . Paclitaxel give weekly total 16 dos begin Week 2 . After complete 16 dos paclitaxel , trastuzumab pertuzumab may continue every 3 week surgery . Study treatment visit occur regular interval period study treatment , begin Week 1 . During study treatment visit follow do : physical exam , performance status , blood sample , heart function test . After complete 16 dos paclitaxel combination pertuzumab trastuzumab , undergo surgery removal breast cancer . This occur approximately 4-5 week last paclitaxel infusion . Prior surgery , follow assessment : repeat breast MRI , PET scan ( necessary ) , physical exam , vital sign , performance status , blood test , tumor tissue test . Approximately 4-5 week surgery , well-healed , two option treatment ( physician 's discretion ) : Option 1 : Doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) , every 2-3 week x 4 cycle . This standard chemotherapy IBC . Followed trastuzumab pertuzumab every 3 week complete 12 month HER2-directed therapy . Option 2 : Continue trastuzumab pertuzumab every 3 week complete 12 month HER2-directed therapy . Doxorubicin give vein 5-10 minute . This follow cyclophosphamide vein give 30 minute . Anti-nausea medicine give first direction doctor . Approximately 4-5 week finish AC treatment pursue Option 1 ( 4-5 week surgery pursue Option 2 ) , receive radiation therapy mastectomy site surround lymph node . This give daily , Monday Friday approximately 6-7 week . This administered standard care IBC . Approximately 3-4 week follow completion AC pursue Option 1 ( 3-4 week surgery pursue Option 2 ) , begin maintenance therapy trastuzumab pertuzumab . As Week 1 , Day 1 , receive intravenous infusion trastuzumab 90 minute follow 60 minute observation period . If trastuzumab infusion tolerate , receive rest study treatment , pertuzumab . This also give intravenous infusion 60 minute observe 60 minute . Thus , total duration infusion observation period first day maintenance study treatment 5 hour . If study drug well tolerate , duration infusion trastuzumab pertuzumab may shorten subsequent dos . Both trastuzumab pertuzumab give every 3 week complete 12 month duration HER2-directed therapy . Every 9 week ( every third dose trastuzumab pertuzumab ) undergo procedure taht describe Study Treatment visit . About one month last dose study treatment , ask return clinic . At visit test do check physical condition check recover side effect study treatment . During visit follow do : physical exam , vital sign , performance status blood test . You ask attend regular follow visit check experience long term side effect check taht cancer come back . We plan follow participant 13 year start teh study . During visit follow do : physical exam question health/medications take ( every 3 month first year , every 6 month next 4 year , yearly end study follow ) ; blood draw ( every 6 month first 4 year , yearly ) ; mammogram perform annually , scan may perform need .</detailed_description>
