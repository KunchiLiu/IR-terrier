	<brief_summary>To demonstrate minimally invasive surgical procedure combination use Cochlear Baha BA400 abutment associate reduction inflammation/infection , overgrowth , pain numbness site implantation compare traditional surgical procedure combination use standard Baha abutment ( Cochlear Baha BA300 Abutment ) . To demonstrate minimally invasive surgical procedure combination use Cochlear Baha BA400 abutment associate reduction direct medical cost , due short surgical procedure , fast wound heal less complication compare traditional surgical procedure combination use standard Baha abutment ( Cochlear Baha BA300 Abutment ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Health Economic Evaluation With New BahaÂ® Abutment Combined With Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite extensive soft tissue reduction , common complication associate Baha implant related adverse skin reaction around abutment . The reduction skin also add complexity surgical procedure otherwise routine type skin incision . A less invasive surgical technique avoid reduce thickness skin would render simpler shorter procedure would aesthetically appeal patient , permanent hair removal area around abutment would require . Faster heal less numbness ( sensory loss/ paraesthesia ) implant site may also expect soft tissue thickness leave intact . The Cochlea Baha BA300 Abutment together surgical procedure include soft tissue reduction CE mark April 2010 . The test abutment , Cochlear Baha BA400 , together surgical procedure require soft tissue reduction CE mark June 2012 . The rationale behind investigation make 'head-to-head ' comparison BA300 BA400 Abutment associate surgical technique order collect information regard complication ( inflammation/infection , numbness pain ) , aesthetic outcome utilisation direct medical cost associate surgery .</detailed_description>
