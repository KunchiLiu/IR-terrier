	<detailed_description>1 . An integrated study design This clinical study combine clinical safety evaluation contraceptive vaginal ring ( CVR ) social science research acceptability adherence ring use Rwandan woman . The clinical part study assess general safety contraceptive ring include effect vaginal microbiome , genitourinary symptom sign clinical adverse event . In addition clinical part study aim understand well possible biofilm formation explore impact ring microbiome inflammation vagina . The social science component consist combination mixed-methods research include In-depth Interviews ( IDIs ) , Focus Group Discussions ( FGDs ) , questionnaire , ( fund permit ) audio computer-assisted self-interviewing ( ACASI ) . 2 . Clinical study design This open label single-centre cohort study NuvaRing速 . A total 120 Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) -negative woman randomize intermittent regimen continuous regimen ring use follow maximum 14 week , determine general safety ring African context , determine difference vaginal microbiome vaginal inflammation use contraceptive vaginal ring ( CVR ) . Qualitative research social science component perform address acceptability adherence intermittent continuous CVR use depth . Women randomize two study group : 60 intermittent user group A 60 continuous user group B . Both group use NuvaRing速 . Women group A ( intermittent user ) use CVR 3 week follow one week ring use allow menstruation . Women group B ( continuous user ) use ring 3 week , next ring insert immediately previous one period [ 4 ] . The total duration enrolment last study visit maximum 14 week . The screen process maximum 6 week . As noticed , study include also social science component , aim assess level acceptability report adherence intermittent continuous Contraceptive Vaginal Rings ( CVRs ) use woman Rwanda ; identify describe context specific attitude beliefs regard family , family planning , gendered norm ; explore woman 's beliefs expectation regard future potential use multi-purpose ring ( contraception Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) prevention ) ; explore woman men Rwanda perceive experience risk relate unwanted pregnancy Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) .
