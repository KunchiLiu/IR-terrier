	<brief_title>Metformin-Docetaxel Association Metastatic Hormone-refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer : current issue In developed country , prostate cancer represent major health issue incidence rise globally , due age society ( Ferlay , Autier et al . 2007 ; Damber Aus 2008 ) . Indeed , 70 % patient prostate cancer age 65 year ( Quinn Babb 2002 ) . In France , prostate cancer second common cause death cancer men represent 10 death 100 cancer ( INVS 2009 ) . Although screen early detection improve , significant percentage men diagnose prostate cancer develop metastasis , reduce dramatically 5-year relative survival ( Jemal , Thun et al . 2008 ) . For patient metastatic prostate cancer , first-line treatment relies androgen suppression follow medical therapy surgical orchiectomy . In 80 percent men , androgen ablation lead symptomatic improvement ; however , despite treatment , risk relapse median period 24 month follow hormone manipulation survival median 3 year ( 1995 ; Sharifi , Dahut et al . 2005 ) . Clinical management Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer : Currently , treatment metastatic prostate cancer , become unresponsiveness androgen deprivation therapy , mostly resume relatively ineffective chemotherapy . Indeed , disease state consider final stage disease morbidity mortality outlook extremely bleak , therapeutic option remain palliative . Combined Docetaxel ( TAXOTERE® ) prednisone currently consider standard care men castration-resistant prostate cancer detectable metastatic disease , base largely simultaneous publication October 2004 two large randomize controlled trial : SWOG 9916 et TAX 327 , compare combination previous establish standard Mitoxantrone prednisone ( Petrylak , Tangen et al . 2004 ; Tannock , de Wit et al . 2004 ) . While use Mitoxantrone lead pain reduction quality life improvement , without survival improvement ( Tannock , Osoba et al . 1996 ) , Docetaxel become approved systemic agent show improve overall survival conjunction palliative benefit . Docetaxel ( TAXOTERE® ) use base ability induce microtubule polymerization discovery Bcl-2 expression , antiapoptotic protein , prostate cancer cell line metastatic hormone resistant patient . Indeed , taxane phosphorylating Bcl-2 induced apoptosis cell express protein ( McDonnell , Navone et al . 1997 ) . In phase III TAX-327 study , median survival 18.9 month 3-week Docetaxel plus prednisone group 16.5 month compare mitoxantrone plus prednisone group . Correspondingly , clinically apparent improvement also report term PSA response rate , pain response quality life , despite increase toxicity group receive Docetaxel . However , adverse event associate Docetaxel low grade bothersome rather life-threatening ( Tannock , de Wit et al . 2004 ) . In study , median duration PSA response range 7.7 8.2 month differ significantly among Docetaxel Mitoxantrone group . In addition , common manifestation metastatic prostate cancer , bone mestastasis occur 65 75 % ( Bubendorf , Schopfer et al . 2000 ; Roudier , True et al . 2003 ) also difficult quantify accurately . Thus , prostate cancer , PSA-based endpoint use surrogate clinical benefit demonstrate drug activity clinical trial . However , regard limited modest gain Docetaxel base chemotherapy , trial focus improve efficacy Docetaxel combine novel biological agent , date without demonstrable improvement ( Ramsay Leung 2009 ; Singh , Yam et al . 2010 ) . Interest associate Docetaxel ( TAXOTERE® ) Metformin Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer Metformin ( N ' , N'-dimethylbiguanide ) wildly use anti-diabetic drug clinical advantage side effect except rare lactic acidosis patient renal insufficiency ( Lalau Race 1999 ) . Metformin effective treating disorder mark insulin-resistance . Several recent publication show Metformin anti-cancer property Epidemiologic clinical evidence : Several retrospective epidemiologic study , diabetic patient , show Metformin associate reduce risk cancer type ( Evans , Donnelly et al . 2005 ; Currie , Poole et al . 2009 ) . Thus , first retrospective cohort study 62,809 type 2 diabetic patient treat UK , author examine risk development solid tumor relation treatment oral agent , human insulin insulin analogue . Results show people insulin sulfonylurea likely develop solid cancer Metformin . In study , Metformin use associate low risk cancer colon pancreas , seem affect risk breast prostate cancer ( Currie , Poole et al . 2009 ) . In another UK observational cohort study , cancer diagnose among 7.3 % 4,085 Metformin user compare 11.6 % 4,085 diabetic comparators never use Metformin . After adjust baseline characteristic , still significantly reduce risk cancer associate Metformin ( 37 % low non Metformin user group ) ( Libby , Donnelly et al . 2009 ) . In addition study cancer , specific investigation report Metformin use also associate significant decrease relative risk specific cancer pancreatic cancer ( Li , Yeung et al . 2009 ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( Donadon , Balbi et al . 2010 ; Hassan , Curley et al . 2010 ) , prostate ( Wright Stanford 2009 ) breast cancer ( Bodmer , Meier et al . 2010 ) . Furthermore , later year follow , high dos Metformin associate great reduction risk cancer , support protective effect Metformin ( Evans , Donnelly et al . 2005 ; Libby , Donnelly et al . 2009 ) ( see review : Beck Scheen 2010 ) . Concerning prostate cancer , Finish American study , show significant decrease prostate cancer incidence patient treat Metformin ( Murtola , Tammela et al . 2008 ; Wright Stanford 2009 ) . Results population-based case-control study men age 35-74 year diagnosed prostate cancer show Metformin use common control case ( 4,7 versus 2,8 % , p = 0,04 ) ( Wright Stanford 2009 ) , result 44 % risk reduction prostate cancer . A recent pilot clinical study , perform 25 non-diabetic patient , show Metformin reduce significantly number colorectal aberrant crypt focus ( endoscopic surrogate marker colorectal cancer ) ( Hosono , Endo et al . 2010 ) . This study demonstrate first time beneficial effect Metformin anti-cancerous therapy . Very recent preliminary data , present 33rd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium , consistent previous study show Metformin may beneficial effect cancer therapy ( 33rd annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium , December 2010 , San Antonio , USA ) . At cellular level , combine treatment metformine erlotinib lead synergistic growth inhibitory effect proliferation assay clonogenic assay breast cancer cell . The combined treatment also robustly reduce activation EGFR , AKT , ERK S6 signal either drug use alone . Moreover , pilot mouse xenograft study , combination treatment show shrink tumor average approximately 25 % ( Meiers PJ 2010 ) . Data interim safety analysis demonstrate preoperative metformin , early stage breast cancer , significantly reduce cancer cell proliferation ( measure change Ki67 index ) induce apoptosis ( TUNEL , cleave caspase 3 ) ( Niraula S 2010 ) . Effects use also associate improved insulin resistance ( Niraula S 2010 ) . Those preliminary result show meformin well tolerate expect mild grade 1 toxicity significant QOL effect ( Bonanni B 2010 ; Niraula S 2010 ) . In addition , note change insulin glycaemia level report metformin use ( Bonanni B 2010 ) , except slight decrease BMI ( Niraula S 2010 ) . Experimental evidence : In xenograft model , Metformin show inhibit human prostate cancer cell proliferation well decrease significantly tumor growth ( Ben Sahra , Laurent et al . 2008 ) . Other investigation demonstrate direct inhibitory effect Metformin growth cancer cell originate breast ( Zakikhani , Dowling et al . 2006 ) , ovary ( Rattan , Giri et al . 2009 ) , pancreas ( Kisfalvi , Eibl et al . 2009 ) colon ( Buzzai , Jones et al . 2007 ) well tumor growth mouse model ( see review : Ben Sahra , Le Marchand-Brustel et al . 2010 ) ) . At cellular level , Metformin provoke cell arrest G0/G1 stage induce apoptosis several cell type . The mTOR Akt pathways frequently activate cancer , correlate poor prognosis . In prostate cancer cell , Tanti 's team show Metformin strongly inhibit mTOR pathway regulate cyclin D1 expression , protein associate cellular transformation ( Ben Sahra , Laurent et al . 2008 ) . Preclinical preliminary study , perform laboratory , also show , combinating Metformin TAXOTERE® , potentiate significantly anti-proliferative effect TAXOTERE® . Furthermore , Metformin also increase TAXOTERE®-induced apoptosis prostate cancer cell . 2 . Location work context current knowledge : Therefore , target specifically cancer cell metabolism , Metformin offer new promise therapeutic strategy . Indeed , Metformin well tolerate use 30 year treatment type II diabetes . The efficiency Metformin anti-proliferative anti-tumoral agent mouse accord recent clinical report breast field , raise possibility Metformin could potential candidate novel treatment cancer , especially human prostate cancer . Here , hypothesize Metformin may improve TAXOTERE® efficacy patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . The primary objective randomize study evaluate biological efficacy Metformin combination TAXOTERE® patient metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer . To achieve purpose , PSA response rate evaluate accord ASTRO definition ( Bubley , Carducci et al . 1999 ) . Concurrently , secondary endpoint investigation order evaluate clinical response accord RECIST criterion , overall free-progression survival quality life . Toxicity assessment also perform regard drug combination . Considering well tolerability Metformin first clinical pre-clinical data report use cancer treatment , combine Docetaxel ( TAXOTERE® ) Metformin may represent promise strategy treatment hormone-refractory prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
