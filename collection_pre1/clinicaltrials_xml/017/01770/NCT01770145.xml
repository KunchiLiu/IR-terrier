	<detailed_description>This Phase IV , Open-Label , Efficacy Safety Study APOKYN® intend assess effect APOKYN treatment rapid reliable improvement motor symptom PD subject suffer delay unreliable onset L-dopa action . The study also include sub-group 8 subject evaluate gastroparesis ass gastric empty measure explore APOKYN influence gastric empty rather bypass stomach subcutaneous route administration . The primary objective study assess effect APOKYN treatment rapid reliable improvement motor symptom PD subject suffer delay unreliable onset L-dopa action ( define ) . APOKYN treatment also assess sub-group PD subject suffer gastroparesis delay onset L-dopa action . Delayed unreliable onset L-dopa study population define impaired motor function ( tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity , and/or postural instability ) persist minimum 45 minute take dose L-dopa delay onset action . The impaired motor function result delay L-dopa onset refer `` delay ON '' occur upon awaken refer `` morning akinesia . '' Main Study : This multicenter , multiple-treatment , open-label , outpatient study evaluate efficacy safety APOKYN PD subject delay onset L dopa action . The study : - Screening - 1-5 day ( Visit 1 ) ; - Baseline L-Dopa Period - 7 day , continuation L dopa treatment ; - Antiemetic Treatment Period - 3-days ; initiation trimethobenzamide 300 mg tid orally ; - APOKYN Initiation/optimum dose identification Period ( Visit 2 ) - variable , 11 day ; - APOKYN Treatment Period - 7 day , immediately upon identification optimum dose ; - Study Discharge ( Visit 3 ) - within 2 day completion APOKYN treatment period . Gastroparesis Sub-Study : A sub-group subject ( n=8 ) 1 study site symptom gastroparesis admit clinic 2 occasion undergo gastroparesis procedure assessment ( conclusion baseline L-dopa period conclusion APOKYN treatment period ) . Note , second gastroparesis assessment , sub-group subject extension one extra day beyond designated 7 day APOKYN treatment period ( i.e. , 8 day ) order keep 7 day diary record outpatient scope work rest subject study . The second inpatient period also consider end-of-study visit sub group .</detailed_description>
