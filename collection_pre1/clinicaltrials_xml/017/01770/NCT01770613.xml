	<brief_title>A Study Allogeneic Mesenchymal Bone Marrow Cells Subjects With ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain leading cause morbidity mortality despite continue advance various treatment option . In developed country , ischemic heart disease cause 50 % cardiovascular death . It estimate one three approximately 80 million American adult one type CVD , approximately 38.1 million estimate 60 year age old . The data extrapolate United States population 2006 National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 2005-2006 data . Mortality data show CVD underlie cause death ( include congenital cardiovascular defect ) account 35.3 % ( 864,480 ) 2,448,017 deaths 2005 , one every 2.8 death United States . CVD total death ( 1,372,000 death 2005 ) account 56 % deaths 2005 . Nearly 2,400 Americans die CVD day , average one death every 30 second . CVD claim many life year cancer , chronic low respiratory disease , accident , diabetes mellitus combine ( NCHS ) . Stem cell transplantation potential repair improve cardiac function , thus help significantly decrease morbidity mortality rate . Preclinical data variety animal study demonstrate capacity skeletal myoblasts engraft , form myotubules , enhance cardiac function transplantation infarcted myocardium . The underlie sequela post infarcted left ventricle often include massive damage cardiomyocyte . The left ventricle remodel ( dilation ) dysfunction think irreversible . The development treatment regenerate musculature vascular component consider main therapeutic challenge . Preliminary human study focus subject ischemic heart disease demonstrate successful myoblast transplantation post infarction scar . Another study demonstrate benefit stem cell therapy ventricular function profusion . Dib et . al. , demonstrate survival , feasibility , safety autologous myoblast transplantation suggest stem cell transplantation offer potential therapeutic treatment end-stage heart disease . Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell use number clinical trial different indication . These clinical trial demonstrate safety allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell treatment . Allogenic mesenchymal bone marrow cell isolate bone marrow . They primary cell use tissue engineering express multiple cell type . Tissue engineering promising , generate hope reconstruction organ repair diseased damage tissue may possible . There two major type aMBMC , hematopoetic ( mononuclear ) stromal MSCs . Stromal MBMC , cell type use study , prove effective reestablish profusion secrete additional cytokine factor associate angiogenesis . The multilineage potential stromal MSCs , ability elude detection host immune system even regulate T-cell response allow allogeneic multiple stem cell therapeutic use . Occlusion leave main leave anterior descend artery cause irreversible injury cardiomyocytes little 20 minute . The goal therapy ischemic cardiomyopathy limit damage follow area : - Limit infarct size - Prevent reperfusion injury - Prevent excessive fibrosis - Reestablish function hibernate cardiomyocytes peripheral zone area . - Reestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis - Preserve wall motion ( prevent arrhythmia functional contractile deterioration ) - Prevent post infarct ventricular remodel leave ventricular dilation It well accept dilate cardiomyopathy mortality rate 50 % within 5 year diagnosis . If preserve restore cardiac function measure ejection fraction , preserve leave ventricular integrity would increase subject quality life well longevity . An IV study administer adult allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) 53 subject follow AMI show excellent safety , reduction arrhythmia , improvement functional status increase ejection fraction . The availability `` shelf '' allogeneic stem cell allow easily adjustable dose ( get enough cell autologous model often problem ) individual subject . The ease IV administration make stem cell therapy cost effective safer administer current catheter model . This study protocol expand safety efficacy aMBMC subject suffer ischemic cardiomyopathy .</detailed_description>
