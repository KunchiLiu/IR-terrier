	<brief_summary>Wright et al ( Anticancer Res , 2000 ) report result retrospective study 11 patient advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer . All patient multi-site disease heavily pretreated median 3 prior chemotherapy regimen . All receive bevacizumab combination therapy well-tolerated . Two patient partial response , 3 stable disease , 5 patient progress . One subject assessable response . The median progression-free interval 5.4 month entire cohort 8.7 month achieve clinical benefit ( PR SD ) . The author conclude Bevacizumab well-tolerated display promising anti-neoplastic activity patient endometrial cancer.The rationale combine anti-angiogenic agent , include anti-VEGF antibody , cytotoxic chemotherapy stem number preclinical study show additive synergistic anti-tumour activity number solid tumour type . By combine VEGF-targeting agent bevacizumab conventional chemotherapy , hop agent act synergistically , thereby enhance anti-tumour efficacy control disease progression . The addition bevacizumab chemotherapy show improve PFS and/or OS series large , randomized Phase III clinical trial wide range tumour type , include mCRC , non-squamous NSCLC , metastatic BC ( mBC ) mRCC .</brief_summary>
