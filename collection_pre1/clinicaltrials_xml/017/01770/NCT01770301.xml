	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab ( call also Avastin ® ) medicine prevent creation new blood vessel ( process call `` angiogenesis '' ) . This reduce blood flow tumor decrease contribution nutriment oxygen cancer cell prevent tumor grow . In various type cancer , lung , breast , colorectal renal cancer , addition bevacizumab chemotherapy allow improve disease outcome . The bevacizumab already benefit market authorization ( MMA ) various type cancer . The bevacizumab also obtain MMA treatment ovarian cancer frequent histological form ( ovarian carcinoma ) . Clinical trial conduct indication demonstrate importance pursue treatment bevacizumab chemotherapy end . This anti-angiogenic medicine think potential interest sex cords- stromal since tumor well vascularize . The ALIENOR study aim explore interest clinical benefit associate bevacizumab paclitaxel order treat patient suffer recur sex cords- stromal tumor treat beforehand platinum chemotherapy</brief_summary>
