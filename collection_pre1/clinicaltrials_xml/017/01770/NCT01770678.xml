	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Two Methods CIMT Hemiplegic Child</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) common lifelong neurodisability prevalence approximately 2 per 1000 child bear Europe . Hemiplegic cerebral palsy ( HCP ) characterise unilateral motor impairment present around 30 % CP UK . The associated impairment arm hand cause lifelong major difficulty manual dexterity upper limb functional ability independence . Elective non-use may add substantially problem child may disregard affected hand even actual motor loss mild . This may lead impairment include increased muscle tone , reduce range movement , weakness delay skeletal maturity.Physiotherapists occupational therapist routinely involve care child CP . They employ number strategy upper limb rehabilitation . However , lack randomise control trial ( RCTs ) mean effect different upper limb treatment well understood . Also efficacy therapy question . Constraint induce movement therapy ( CIMT ) origins behavioral research primate conduct Taub 1980s . It consist immobilisation unaffected upper limb , together mass practice affect upper limb . It extensively test adult poststroke found effective improve patient center motor outcome improvement maintain 24 month . A Cochrane review CIMT child HCP ( 2007 ) 2 RCTs ( n=49 ) case control study find evidence use CIMT promise need evidence support use practice.Additionally , Huang ( 2009 ) carry systematic review 21 intervention study 5 RCTs ( n=114 ) use CIMT child HCP find positive support although recommendation research provide information threshold effective intensity comparison different component relation specific child . The McMaster Centre Child Disability Research describe evidence use CIMT HCP promise rate ' A ' although recommend investigation require continue evaluate effectiveness address ongoing question . The aim study compare use CIMT preschool child NHS setting , use prolonged restraint ( splint/cast bandage enclose finger ) use brief manual restraint may use current practice act control arm . The research proposal develop scientific critique also input level service user ( parent ) whose child already involve CIMT especially one subject single case study carry author . Design : A pragmatic , multicentered , blind , individually randomise control trial . Baseline Assessment Three baseline assessment conduct prior randomisation . The Assisting Hand Assessment ( AHA ) , develop child age 18 month 5 year well evaluated measure appropriate hand function hemiplegia carry chief investigator ( CI ) . The AHA administer 2 step . Firstly DVD make 1015 minute semistructured play session child use toys AHA kit require bimanual activity . Using DVD , play session score validated AHA scorer . The CI carry record play session score along another AHA validate scorer therapist work another NHS trust . The CI also assess patient 's affected upper limb use Quality Of Upper Extremity Skills Test ( QUEST ) evaluate four domain : dissociate movement , grasp , protective extension , weight bearing . This provide evaluation severity underlie impairment allow comparison study . Parents/guardians complete PedsQL Generic Core Scales Cerebral palsy Module ass impact quality life . Randomisation carry use standard method adequate concealment . Analysis do intention treat basis . Intervention Following randomisation child either allocate control arm , involve episode CIMT use brief manual restraint therapy intervention arm , involve episode CIMT use prolonged restraint use cast/splint crepe bandage enclose finger therapy.Some parents/guardians may choose put sock restraint keep clean . Both method offer 6 week ( 42days ) intervention 10 week period.It would expect active period would start 2 week randomisation would later 4 week randomisation.This amount intervention inform previous CIMT study HCP line amount intervention may offer episode care standard practice . The control arm involve unaffected hand gently hold able participate activity encourage child use affect hand instead . This therapy would guide therapist would carry mainly parents/guardians child attends nursery nursery worker . The support nursery worker may expect usual practice . The therapy would expect last approximately one hour per day . It necessary time continuous meal time include parents/guardians able accomplish . NHS REC Form Reference : 10/H1207/36 IRAS Version 2.5 Date : 30/03/2010 7 47136/110912/1/802 randomisation would later 4 week randomisation.This amount intervention inform previous CIMT study HCP line amount intervention may offer episode care standard practice . The control arm involve unaffected hand gently hold able participate activity encourage child use affect hand instead . This therapy would guide therapist would carry mainly parents/guardians child attends nursery nursery worker . The support nursery worker may expect usual practice . The therapy would expect last approximately one hour per day . It necessary time continuous meal time include parents/guardians able accomplish . The intervention arm involve restrain unaffected hand use belowelbow splint/cast crepe bandage.Some parents/guardians may choose put sock restraint keep clean . The restraint use limit activity unaffected hand . The therapy implement time , encourage use affected hand , would offer exactly way control arm . Using belowelbow method prolong restraint , allow unaffected upper limb continue participate degree bimanual activity , therefore less intrusive child . In addition use splint/cast bandage relatively nonstigmatising child splints/casts bandage unusual event society . With regard prolong restraint would aim parents/guardians persist although may take time child adjust , would expect appropriate attention task could achieve . However , child completely unaccepting prolonged restraint , may approximately three/four day , follow discussion therapist parents/guardians recommendation may make discontinue prolonged restraint continue therapy . Setting The research carry set patient receive usual treatment either home local clinic . Prolonged restraint apply local clinic . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure : The primary outcome measure change AHA 10 week trial entry carry CI blind patient allocation score carry validated AHA scorer work another trust blind allocation . Secondary Measures : - A change AHA 24 week trial entry carry CI blind patient allocation score carry validated AHA scorer work another trust blind allocation . - A change QUEST 10 week 24 week trial entry carry CI . - A change PedsQL Generic Core Scales Cerebral Palsy Module 10 week 24 week trial entry carry parents/guardians . - During intervention parents/guardians , nursery worker therapist ask collect information acceptability compliance restraint therapy . Recruitment : Target population : Patients participate trust child 's service directorate treatment database , fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion , identify treat therapist , approach . Inclusion/exclusion All eligible child HCP age 18months9 month start compulsory education include . The intervention target preschool child would potential benefit ( neural plasticity may greatest ) least disruptive compulsory education . The maximum age 9 month child start compulsory education allow child randomise control arm possibility episode prolong CIMT request parents/guardians start compulsory education . Exclusion criterion include : - Where skin condition present may cause problem splinting/ cast - If abnormal neurological involvement upper limbs - Clinical presentation athetosis/ dystonia - If child receive &gt; 2 week prolong restraint use cast/splint within last 6 month . Consent Consent parents/guardians gain prior inclusion . Parents/guardians prospective patient give full explanation trial treat therapist principal investigator ( PI ) understand ethical principle underpin informed consent . Discussion include reason research carry , information treatment option , risk benefit manner treatment allocation . They give patient information sheet read sufficient time decide whether would like join trial . Simple explanation intervention give child within limit understand . Parents/guardians ask sign consent form different therapist possible part clinical care team . If support need interpreter provide . It make clear take part affect treatment way . Specific consent gain make , post store DVDs part AHA assessment . Risks benefit A risk assessment trial perform included consultation parents/guardians child already involve CIMT . The CIMT intervention consider low risk . NHS REC Form Reference : 10/H1207/36 IRAS Version 2.5 Date : 30/03/2010 8 47136/110912/1/802 give patient information sheet read sufficient time decide whether would like join trial . Simple explanation intervention give child within limit understand . Parents/guardians ask sign consent form different therapist possible part clinical care team . If support need interpreter provide . It make clear take part affect treatment way . Specific consent gain make , post store DVDs part AHA assessment . Risks benefit A risk assessment trial perform included consultation parents/guardians child already involve CIMT . The CIMT intervention consider low risk . The risk identify include : - The child allocate intervention arm may become frustrated leading increase poor behavior able use unaffected hand . Every effort make keep minimum provide appropriate toys advice activity . Clear guideline available therapist parents/guardians respond . The method choose prolonged restraint removable parents/guardians instruction remove splint/cast need emergency contact numbers.If total noncompliance child , three /four day decision may make therapist parent/guardian discontinue . - The skin upper limb restrain prolonged period may become red sore . At bad could become blistered . This highlighted parents/guardians . It would expect case child would complain parents/guardians would able remove restraint . As splint/cast removable skin condition check . - The unaffected upper limb restrain may less effective saving reaction . The method restraint choose elbow keep minimum . However may increase risk injury fall . This risk keep minimum highlighting parents/guardians advise limit situation would especially challenge balance offer supervision situation . - Adverse event record therapist also record way adverse event occur NHS patient . Those patient randomise CIMT use brief manual restraint ( control arm ) whose parents/guardians request episode CIMT prolong restraint ( intervention arm ) offer end trial compulsory education begin . Confidentiality Members direct clinical care team access personidentifiable information usual practice . This trial use person identifiable data instead unique identifier use . Any data generate part research store securely . DVDs participant make part AHA assessment . All DVDs encrypt standard recommend NHS store lock cupboard . Some DVDs produce part AHA post another NHS trust use track service score therapist validate AHA scorer.Secure storage provide trust . Parents/guardians informed transfer ask consent . All data store secure cupboard 5 year end trial destroyed .</detailed_description>
