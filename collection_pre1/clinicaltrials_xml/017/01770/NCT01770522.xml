The societal economic impact obesity pregnancy therefore life-long . Excessive weight gain pregnancy little positive effect foetal growth pregnancy duration ( Scholl et al , 1995 ) associate similar range adverse outcome describe ( Guelinckx et al. , 2008 ) . It also associate great probability post-partum weight retention . Linn√© et al ( 2004 ) show normal weight overweight/obese woman gain excessive weight likely retain weight 1 15 year pregnancy , compare woman gain recommended amount weight pregnancy . Whilst US Institute Medicine recommend low pregnancy weight gain range overweight obese woman ( IOM , 2009 ) , currently UK evidence base guideline outline appropriate BMI-specific weight gain ( NICE , 2009 ) . The current UK guide weight gain 10 - 12.5kg woman ( DoH , 2009 ) . There concern express woman inform risk associate obesity pregnancy , importance safe weight gain pregnancy ( NICE , 2009 ) .

Childbearing may affect attitude towards body image psychological dimension weight also important understand postpartum weight retention . Relatively study investigate effect risk factor weight retention postpartum woman . Gaining intelligence representative population group necessary selection development effective strategy aid development commission service pathways help address maternal obesity post partum weight management . Aim The primary risk factor retain weight postnatal period excessive gestational weight gain ( Linne et al. , 2002 ) . However , number factor associate increase risk weight retention , include high pre-pregnancy body mass index ( BMI ) , primiparity , short duration breastfeeding , stop smoking , high dietary energy intake low physical activity ( Gunderson et al. , 2000 ; Gore et al. , 2003 ; Siega-Riz et al. , 2004 ) .
