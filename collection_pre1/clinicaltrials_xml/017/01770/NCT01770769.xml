	<brief_summary>Clinical research last ten year reveal elderly patient displace femoral neck fracture treat arthroplasty instead close reduction fracture follow internal fixation pin screw . Few clinical trial address undisplaced minimally displaced fracture femoral neck . These fracture associate good prognosis likewise good functional outcome . However , recent article present far less favorable result , high re-operation rate ( 10-15 % ) , reduce function , pain walk internal fixation . Indirect compare study , suggest hemiarthroplasty may yield good functional outcome low re-operation rate . Approximately 20 % femoral neck fracture patient age 70 year old minimally displace undisplaced . Hence investigator call randomise controlled trial comparing pain , function , walk ability , quality life , re-operation rate complication internal fixation versus hemiarthroplasty patient age 70 year old .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The consequence femoral neck fracture still substantial impact individual patient´s health well society . Approximately 5000 individual suffer fracture femoral neck annually Norway . The mortality rate approximate 25 % first year injury . The hospital cost treat single femoral neck fracture , estimate 20 000 euro . In spite relatively well-documented treatment protocol , still need prospective randomise controlled trial determine optimal treatment certain sub-groups patient present femoral neck fracture . Several study high level evidence elucidate management displaced femoral neck fracture . There increase evidence favour joint replacement surgery internal fixation treat displaced femoral neck fracture . However , management undisplaced minimally displaced femoral neck fracture receive less attention . According Cochrane Library , randomise control trial compare internal fixation hemiarthroplasty patient undisplaced femoral neck fracture . Previous study focus mostly fracture healing , equate fracture union success . However , recent study report decrease functional life quality score amongst patient undisplaced femoral neck fracture treat internal fixation . The control group study consist patient displaced femoral neck fracture treat hemi - arthroplasty . Zlowodzki et al show , mean validated assessment score , patient internally fixate undisplaced femoral neck fracture often experience shorten injure limb . Then , associate low functional life quality score . In Rogmark´s series patient undisplaced femoral neck fracture treat internal fixation , 25 % patient report daily pain affected hip upon walking , one half year surgery . Gjertsen et al analyse data Norwegian hip fracture registry 4000 patient demonstrate treatment hemiarthroplasty , due displace femoral neck fracture , associate good function less pain treatment internal fixation due undisplaced femoral neck fracture . Thus , research group conduct prospective randomise control trial identify difference clinical outcome surgical treatment undisplaced femoral neck fracture patient age 70 year old . The two method compare internal fixation two screw modern modular hemiarthroplasty . The primary outcome measure difference least 10 point Harris Hip Score ( 95 % power , standard deviation approximate 15 point previous Norwegian patient series ) . The primary follow-up length set two year , long-term follow-up five year surgery also plan . It important include cognitively impaired patient account 20-25 % study population . Patients provide informed consent due impair cognitive function , include consent provide family member relative .</detailed_description>
