	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Hypofractionated Proton Therapy Stage II-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional fractionate photon-based radiotherapy 60-63 Gy 1.8-2 Gy/fraction concurrent chemotherapy remain standard treatment practice patient stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) local control rate approximately 50 % median overall survival 18 months.Unfortunately , even standard treatment significant toxicity approximately 40 % patient develop grade 3 high acute toxicity RTOG 9410 study.1 These outcome poor effective treatment regimen need . Higher dose radiation hypothesize improve local control patient stage III NSCLC . This expected translate well overall survival.Given significant improvement outcome patient receive hypofractionation stage I NSCLC , perhaps similar gain could achieve hypofractionated radiotherapy could safely deliver stage II-III NSCLC concurrent chemotherapy . Hypofractionated radiotherapy may offer improvement local control compare conventional fractionation may translate improve overall survival . Furthermore , hypofractionation shorten time interval patient receive less aggressive chemotherapy . Proton therapy highly conformal radiotherapy technique take advantage proton 's characteristic Bragg Peak , result significant reduction exit dose treatment beam . Thus , proton therapy substantially reduce dose critical structure even compare IMRT . This study investigate safety efficacy deliver hypofractionated proton therapy concurrent chemotherapy patient stage II-III NSCLC</detailed_description>
