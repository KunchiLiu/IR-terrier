	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ultrasound-guided photodynamic therapy porfimer sodium give together gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Photodynamic therapy use drug , porfimer sodium , become active expose certain kind light . When drug active , cancer cell kill . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving photodynamic therapy together gemcitabine hydrochloride may effect patient pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Photodynamic Therapy With Photofrin &amp; Gemcitabine Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety increase porfimer sodium ( PHO ) dose total energy endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) locally advance unresectable pancreatic cancer ( PC ) human . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Quantify computed tomography ( CT ) detect volume tumor necrosis produce EUS-PDT . II . Quantify rate tumor size stabilization decrease EUS PDT determine objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . III . Determine surgical downstaging abdominal vessel resectability . IV . Determine change serum cancer antigen ( CA ) 19-9 level treatment . V. Evaluate progression-free overall survival . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study EUS-PDT porfimer sodium . Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously ( IV ) day 1 undergo EUS-PDT day 1 , 3 , 8 , 21 . After completion EUS-PDT , patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 2 day 22 course 3 5 . During course 1-5 , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After course 5 , treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride repeat every 2 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
