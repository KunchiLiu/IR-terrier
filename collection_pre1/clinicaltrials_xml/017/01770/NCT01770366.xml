	<brief_summary>Obesity affect one-third US population , associate serious medical problem like diabetes heart disease . Weight loss surgery effective treatment obesity , weight loss surgery patient lose less weight others , patient regain weight lose . Researchers find support group help post-surgical patient lose weight , long-term support program often n't available difficult patient get . Physical activity also important weight loss surgery patient , post-surgical support program n't focus help patient exercise . Our pilot study test Internet-based weight loss surgery support program patient use home , include new device wireless weight scale wireless pedometer help patient track weight loss physical activity share progress clinician Internet . If successful , support intervention help patient successfully lose weight surgery , therefore improve long-term health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Virtual Support Pilot Program Weight Loss Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For propose pilot study , primary objective determine usability satisfaction virtual weight loss support program incorporate home-based goal-tracking technology ( e.g. , home weighing , activity monitoring ) . FitLinxx , Inc. select partner propose research offer weight scale ( ActiScaleTM ) activity monitor ( PebbleTM ) transmit collect data secure patient portal website ( ActiHealth.com ) via state-of-the-art wireless data transmission technology . In addition view device data patient portal website , program participant able communicate desire weight loss surgery patient though chat room feature patient portal website , also invited participate activity weight loss challenge website ( e.g. , weekly step count challenge , weekly percent excess weight loss challenge ) . E-mail use mean virtual social exchange patient provider , oppose synchronous , face-to-face support group hospital . The virtual patient support program goal-tracking technology describe provide novel , scalable cost effective model patient support associate minimal patient burden . This four-month pilot study virtual patient support program describe enroll total 24 pre-surgical patient recruit Weight Loss Surgery ( WLS ) program Baystate Medical Center ( BMC ) schedule weight loss surgery within four six week enrollment . The final target sample size 18 , reflect goal six patient surgical type ( e.g. , roux-en-Y gastric bypass [ RNY ] , laparoscopic gastric banding [ LGB ] , laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [ LSG ] ) , three group randomize receive intervention three randomize control group . Eligible patient must computer Internet access home ( transmit device data view patient portal website ) , must weigh less 420 pound baseline ( due 440-pound limit weight scale allow weight gain baseline research visit date surgery ) . The sample size recruitment period feasible give approximately 400 patient weight loss surgery Baystate every year ( estimate base figure 2006-2010 ) .</detailed_description>
