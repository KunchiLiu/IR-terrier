	<brief_summary>In western society hypercholesterolemia one major independent factor predispose cardiovascular disease death . According clinical study ATTICA , conduct year 2001-2002 , randomized 1514 men 1528 woman , rate hypercholesterolemia observed sample urban population 39 % men 37 % woman . The prevalence correspond U.S. epidemiological study NIANES 52 % men 49 % woman . The relationship cholesterol , lipid-lowering therapy risk cardiovascular disease appear quite clear secondary prevention trial , 4S ( Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study ) , CARE ( Cholesterol And Recurrent Events ) LIPID ( Long-term Intervention Pravastatin Ischemic Disease ) show benefit lower LDL cholesterol patient coronary artery disease . Despite remarkable result , study secondary prevention major shortcoming , lack patient acute coronary event . This gap come cover study MIRACL ( Myocardial Ischemia Reduction Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering ) . In MIRACL study , atorvastatin 80 mg evaluate 3,086 patient ( atorvastatin n = 1.538 , placebo n = 1.548 ) , acute coronary syndrome ( myocardial infarction without Q-wave unstable angina ) . Treatment initiate acute phase hospital admission last period 16 week . Treatment atorvastatin 80 mg / day increase latency combine primary endpoint , define death cause , nonfatal myocardial infarction , resuscitate cardiac arrest , angina objective evidence myocardial ischemia require admission hospital , indicate risk reduction 16 % ( p = 0,048 ) . This mainly due 26 % reduction re-hospitalization angina objective evidence myocardial ischemia . The secondary endpoint statistically significant ( total : placebo : 22.2 % , Atorvastatin : 22.4 % ) . Statins reduce coronary syndrome , appear contribute reduce incidence cardiovascular disease . This exactly observe 4S , incidence chronic heart failure ( CHF ) follow-up 10.3 % receive placebo 8.3 % simvastatin group , find translates 19 % reduction heart failure ( P &lt; 0,015 ) nationwide appearance episode ( event ) CV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Determination cardiovascular risk If assessment cardiovascular risk remain incomplete , identify indicator measure risk : 1 . Framingham Risk Score : Includes age , sex , total HDL-CHOL , level blood pressure ( underestimate risk patient ) . 2 . PROCAM Risk Score : also include triglyceride , fast glucose tolerance family history . 3 . Reynolds Risk Score : Includes family history level hsCRP . 4 . Greek Score ( www.hearts.org / greece ) . People low risk The Framingham Risk Score show &lt; 10 % chance cardiovascular disease next 10 year . Dealing mainly healthy dietary intervention drug level LDL-CHOL &gt; 190 mg / dL atherogenic index ( T-CHOL/HDL-CHOL ) &gt; 6 . Medication necessary individual familial hypercholesterolemia reduce LDL CHOL &lt; 100 mg / dL . For reason , careful family history take physical examination . The Reynolds Risk Score may reclassify low-risk patient high risk individual . Persons moderate risk This group include mostly middle-aged people . The Framingham Risk Score show 10-19 % chance cardiovascular disease next 10 year . However , positive family history high hsCRP ( available ) modify level risk . These people need change lifestyle 3 month , may necessary pharmacological lipid-lowering therapy people least two major risk factor level LDL-CHOL &gt; 130 mg / dL . The administration lipid-lowering therapy people level LDL-CHOL 100-129 mg / dL recommend people multiple cardiometabolic risk factor ( visceral obesity , prediabetes , hypertension , etc. ) . The increase atheromatic index ( &gt; 5 ) presence high ( &gt; 2 mg / L ) level CRP ( available ) also indications lipid lower regardless level LDL-CHOL . Major risk factor : age &gt; 45 year ( men ) , &gt; 55 year ( woman ) , positive family history premature cardiovascular disease [ presence major vascular event first degree relative &lt; 55 year ( men ) , &lt; 65 year ( woman ) ] , hypertension , HDL-CHOL &lt; 40 mg / dL , smoking . Individuals high risk The Framingham Risk Score show &gt; 20 % chance cardiovascular disease next 10 year . At-risk individual include : A . Individuals document atherosclerotic disease ( coronary artery disease , stroke , significant degree carotid stenosis , peripheral arterial disease , intermittent claudication , aneurysm abdominal aorta ) . B . All type II diabetic patient patient type I diabetes individual old 40 year . C. People chronic kidney disease glomerular filtration ( GFR ) &lt; 60 mL/min/1 , 73 m2 . In individual need intensive lifestyle modification direct administration lipid lower medication statin . According one epidemiological study nature purpose observe record progress patient exit cardiology clinic hospital unit acid cardiovascular event clinical relevance . Compliance medical instruction , achieve treatment goal lipid addition atorvastatin personalized medicine practice open field study . So subject study order highlight clinical significance atorvastatin achieve objective lipid ( mainly LDL-CHOL ) blood plasma `` sensitive '' group patient Greek population , possible representative ( qualitatively quantitatively ) sample . Dyslipidemia The lipid human body cholesterol ( useful synthesis cell membrane , hormone adrenal gonad , component bile , liver secrete ) triglyceride ( serve fuel energy storage adipose tissue ) . The dyslipidemias disorder ( quantitative qualitative ) metabolism lipoprotein particle ( LDL , chylomicron , HDL , VLDL ) transport lipid body . Categories dyslipidemias - Primary dyslipidemias The significant primary lipid disorder : 1 . Chylomicronemia ( congenital acquire ) : ↑ TRG → risk acute pancreatitis . 2 . Familial Hypercholesterolemia Homozygous ( 1/1.000.000 people ) : ↑ LDL CHOL b heterozygous ( 1/500 people ) : ↑ LDL CHOL . 3 . Mixed hyperlipidaemia Familial mixed ( 1/300 people ) : ↑ LDL-CHOL , ↑ TRG , ↓ HDL-CHOL . 4 . Familial hypertriglyceridemia ( 1/2.000 people ) : ↑ TRG . 5 . Familial decrease HDL CHOL : ↓ HDL CHOL . Typically patient primary dyslipidemia need medication . - Secondary dyslipidemias In patient abnormal lipid parameter must exclude secondary dyslipidemias , ie disorder lipid metabolism cause disease drug : 1 . Diabetes 2 . Hypothyroidism 3 . Obstructive liver disease 4 . Chronic kidney disease nephrotic syndrome- 5 . Obesity 6 . Alcohol abuse 7 . Medications cause dyslipidemia progestin b Anabolic Steroids c Corticosteroids D. Diuretics large dos e b-blockers f Antiretroviral Drugs Interferon g h. Retinoids Estrogen tamoxifen . In patient secondary dyslipidemia require treatment primary disease . Determination cohort screening ( Table 1 ) - Men 40 post-menopausal woman - People atherosclerotic disease regardless age clinical finding suggestive dyslipidemia - Patients diabetes regardless age - Patients chronic kidney disease ( eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1 , 73 m2 presence albuminuria ) - People family history premature coronary heart disease - People hypertension - People chronic inflammatory disease ( lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ) - Adults smoke - adult sexual dysfunction - Overweight obese subject BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2 - Relatives people inherited lipid disorder - Children family history hyperlipidemia cardiovascular disease risk factor . Statins - Atorvastatin The cornerstone treatment dyslipidemia statin . Before initiation lipid lower require identification lipid parameter { total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol calculate LDL cholesterol [ equation LDL-CHOL = total cholesterol - ( triglyceride / 5 + HDL cholesterol ) ] } fast 12 - 14 hour , determination glucose level TSH ( exclude underlie hypothyroidism ) transaminases ( AST / ALT ) CPK control undesirable effect . Repeat determination parameter patient achieved goal treatment 2 time year change therapeutic regimen . Repeat laboratory test ( lipid control effectiveness liver enzymes CPK security control ) 12 week : reason discontinue treatment ALT &gt; 3 time upper normal range CPK &gt; 5 time upper normal range patient myalgias . It note necessitate interruption treatment statins deferral treatment individual small increase transaminase CPK , patient seek underlying cause elevate liver muscle enzyme . The choice drug dosage depend percentage change HDL-CHOL necessary achieve objective . Statins usually even bedtime night . The lipid-lowering therapy therapy life , importantly , patient adherence treatment . It note double dose statin result additional reduction HDL-CHOL ( LDL ) cholesterol 6 % . The main goal treatment reduce HDL-CHOL The non HDL-CHOL ( = T-CHOL - HDL-CHOL ) , propose secondary target lipid lower mainly people high triglyceride . The target non HDL-CHOL 30 mg / dL high target HDL-CHOL . The decrease triglyceride ( &lt; 150 mg / dL ) increase HDL-CHOL ( &gt; 40 mg / dL men &gt; 50 mg / dL woman ) consider desirable target mainly lipid lower diabetic patient patient cardiometabolic risk factor . Has also suggest target treatment reduce atheromatous index ( T-CHOL/HDL-CHOL &lt; 4 ) . Atorvastatin indicate adjunct diet reduce elevate total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , apolipoprotein B triglycerides adult , adolescent child age 10 year old primary hypercholesterolaemia , include heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia combine ( mixed ) hyperlipidemia ( type IIa IIv Fredrickson ) , response diet nonpharmacological measure inadequate . Atorvastatin also indicate reduce total cholesterol LDL - cholesterol adult homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia adjunct lipid-lowering treatment ( eg LDL apheresis ) treatments unavailable . Is also use prevent cardiovascular event adult patient think high risk first cardiovascular event , adjunct correction risk factor . Atorvastatin selective , competitive inhibitor HMG-CoA reductase , enzyme responsible conversion 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A mevalonate , precursor sterol , include cholesterol . The triglyceride cholesterol liver incorporate low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) release plasma delivery peripheral tissue . The low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) form VLDL catabolize primarily receptor high affinity LDL ( LDL receptor ) . Atorvastatin lower cholesterol level lipoprotein plasma inhibit HMG-CoA reductase biosynthesis cholesterol liver increase number LDL receptor surface liver cell uptake catabolism LDL . Atorvastatin reduce LDL production number particle LDL . H atorvastatin cause profound sustain increase LDL receptor activity , combination beneficial change quality circulate particle LDL . Atorvastatin effectively reduce LDL-C patient homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia , group patient usually respond lipid-lowering medicine . Atorvastatin dose-response study , show reduce concentration T-CHOL ( 30 % - 46 % ) , LDL-CHOL ( 41 % - 61 % ) , apolipoprotein B ( 34 % - 50 % ) triglycerides ( 14 % - 33 % ) produce variable increase HDL-CHOL apolipoprotein A1 . These result consistent patient heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia , non-familial form hypercholesterolemia mixed hyperlipidemia , include patient noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus . It find decrease value total cholesterol , LDL-CHOL apolipoprotein B reduce risk cardiovascular event mortality thereof .</detailed_description>
