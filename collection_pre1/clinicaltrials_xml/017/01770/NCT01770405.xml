	<brief_summary>This study focus four different lesion : pancreatic cyst , lymph node near gastrointestinal tract , pancreatic mass GIST tumor . On one hand , result obtain previous study advance assessment diagnostic performance Cellvizio needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( nCLE ) system Pancreatic cyst . Safety technical feasibility already perform , interpretation criterion classification exist . On hand , result pancreatic mass , Lymph nod GIST less develop . objective study - Assess diagnostic performance Cellvizio needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( nCLE ) system diagnose mass cystic tumor pancreas , lymph node , submucosal lesion GI tract - Define/Validate descriptive criterion nCLE sequence mass cystic tu-mors pancreas , lymph node , submucosal lesion GI tract</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Registry nCLE Masses Cystic Tumors Pancreas , Lymph Nodes , Submucosal Lesions GI Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principle needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( nCLE ) image organ within adjacent GI respiratory tract mean miniprobe insert endoscopic needle . The fundamental technology , well principle operation nCLE , substantially similar pCLE . endoscopic fine needle use EUS-FNA procedure puncture solid organ pancreas , order get tissue fluid diagnostic purpose . There different caliber endoscopic nee-dles use . The commonly used caliber EUS-FNA procedure 22G , 19G , 25G needle . The nCLE Confocal Miniprobe compatible 19G-type needle . It expect help differentiate different type lesion , especially cyst , lead well patient management . Microscopic tissue information real-time vivo EUS-FNA procedure may allow good differentiation mucinous non-mucinous cyst instance .</detailed_description>
