	<detailed_description>Patients The University-Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf specialist reference centre treatment patient esophageal carcinoma Germany . A prospective database patient surgically resectable esophageal carcinoma establish 1992 Department General , Visceral Thoracic Surgery University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf , Germany . Only patient without perioperative chemotherapy histologically proven esophageal cancer include study . The demographic , clinical , operative postoperative course patient collect . Informed consent obtain patient include prospective database . The study approve Medical Ethical Committee chamber physician Hamburg . Surgical procedure patient esophageal carcinoma encompass either transhiatal ( TH ) thoracoabdominal ( TA ) esophagectomy . The thoraco-abdominal ( Ivor - Lewis ) esophagectomies perform right-sided thoracotomy , median inverse T-shaped laparotomy , left-sided cervicotomy collar anastomosis mid 2003 . From mid 2003 onward anastomosis do highly intrathoracically . A wide peritumoral resection perform include en bloc subtotal esophageal resection dissection right-sided paratracheal , aortopulmonary window , subcarinal , mediastinal , paracardial lymph node . The azygos vein also resect . An extensive lymphadenectomy upper abdominal compartment ( D-II lymphadenectomy , include paracardial node , leave gastric artery node along lymph node lesser curvature stomach , celiac trunk , common hepatic artery , splenic artery ) conduct . The transhiatal esophagectomies consist inversed T-shaped laparotomy , follow wide peritumoral dissection distal esophagus abdominal lymph node dissection upper abdominal compartment ( D-II lymphadenectomy ) , dissection lymph node posterior mediastinum extend far main carina trachea . Above tracheal bifurcation , dissection continue bluntly use digital dissection stay close esophageal wall . Follow-Up Postoperative follow-up conduct patient three month interval first two year six-month interval thereafter , include physical examination , plain chest radiography , abdominal ultrasonography , endoscopy , endosonography , compute tomography chest abdomen well PET-CT January 2006 select case , study tumor marker ( carcinoembryonic antigen CA 19-9 ) , bone scan . Recurrence diagnose proven biopsy unequivocal evidence tumor mass ( newly appear metastasis local recurrence ) tendency grow follow-up and/or follow-up death . Events consider death , local recurrence , distant metastasis . When event record , patient censor last contact . The last general follow-up survivor do end April 2011 . Overall patient survival , define time operation death last follow-up , used measure prognosis . Statistical Analysis We use SPSS 17.0 Windows statistical analysis . Tumor stage grade classify accord 6th 7th edition TNM classification UICC . Associations categorical variable surgery assess Fisher exact test . The Kaplan-Meier method use estimate occurrence probability event ( death , recurrence ) . Point interval estimate survival probability 60 month calculate . Differences patient group respect survival assess use log-rank test , difference consider statistically significant P &lt; 0.05 . Apart patient 's sex age surgery , covariates P value &lt; 0.05 univariate survival analysis ( log rank test ) enter multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis ass independent influence covariates . In case , significance statement refer P value 2-tailed test P-value â‰¤0.05 .</detailed_description>
