	<brief_summary>The incidence complication standard open pancreaticoduodenectomy pancreatic peri-ampullary tumour around 50 % . The amount intra-operative blood loss important factor determines occurrence postoperative complication . Therefore , significant reduction intra-operative blood loss benefit peri-operative course .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Intra-operative Blood Loss Pancreaticoduodenectomy Pancreatic Peri-ampullary Tumors ; Monocentric Trial Standard Open Versus Minimally Invasive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) therapeutic option cure patient suffer pancreatic head peri-ampullary tumor . The standard approach PD open surgery ( OPD ) . With advance technology , data expert center suggest minimally invasive laparoscopic PD ( LPD ) safe feasible , though randomized study lack show clinical benefit LPD vs. OPD . Advantages minimally invasive surgery open surgery reduce tissue damage , surgical trauma immunosuppression . The general objective study compare intra-operative efficacy LPD vs. OPD , particular amount intra-operative blood loss . Study design Monocentric randomize trial compare amount intra-operative blood loss LPD vs. OPD . Patients expect undergo portal vein resection/reconstruction simultaneous type surgery exclude study . Two experienced surgeon perform procedure ; RA perform open BT laparoscopic procedure . A pylorus-resecting PD follow trans-mesocolic end-to-side hepatico-jejunostomy ( HJS ) , pancreatico-gastrostomy ( PGS ) , ante-colic gastro-enterostomy ( GES ) . Da Vinci robotic assistance reconstruction LPD allow HJS PGS , GES do endo-staplers . Statistical consideration Randomization take place pre-operatively informed consent obtain . Patients randomize two group ( OPD vs. LPD ) use permute block size 6 . This imply series 6 consecutive patient , three patient randomize group . There stratification variable . Monocentric randomize trial compare amount intra-operative blood loss LPD vs. OPD . Patients expect undergo portal vein resection/reconstruction simultaneous type surgery exclude study . Reference intra-operative blood loss level available 138 patient ( June 2009 - June 2012 ) , without portal vein resection without additional surgery . Analysis data reveals value follow lognormal distribution ; log-transformed blood loss normal distribution mean standard deviation equal 6.06 0.83 , respectively . The corresponding geometric mean equal 427ml . Based distribution , 42.4 % , 24.7 % 15.1 % subject expect blood loss high 500 , 750 1000 ml , respectively . It assume treatment ( LPD ) lead 50 % reduction ( geometric ) mean . The impact assumption distribution blood loss level imply 15.1 % , 6.4 % 3.1 % subject LPD-group expect blood loss level high 500 , 750 1000 ml , respectively . Based two-sided two-sample pool t-test mean ratio lognormal data , total 50 subject need detect two-fold reduction blood loss ( alpha set 5 % ) 90 % power .</detailed_description>
