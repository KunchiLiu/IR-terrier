	<brief_summary>The aim study demonstrate safety immunogenicity quadrivalent influenza intradermal ( QIV-ID ) vaccine compare trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) contain B strain primary ( Yamagata ) lineage ( TIV-ID1 ) trivalent influenza vaccine contain B strain alternate ( Victoria ) lineage ( TIV-ID2 ) vaccine produce protection four strain influenza virus . Primary Objective : - To demonstrate QIV-ID induces immune response ( assessed hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) geometric mean titer ( GMTs ) seroconversion rate ) non-inferior response induce TIV-ID1 TIV-ID2 4 virus strain 28 day post-vaccination . Secondary Objectives : - To demonstrate B strain QIV-ID induces immune response ( assessed HAI GMTs seroconversion rate ) superior response induce TIV-ID contain correspond B strain . - To describe rate post-vaccination seroprotection induce QIV-ID TIV-ID . - To describe post-vaccination immunogenicity stratify age ( 18-49 year 50-64 year ) , race , ethnicity , gender , previous vaccination status , baseline seropositivity status . - To describe safety profile subject receive QIV-ID TIV-ID . Observational Objectives : - To demonstrate non-inferiority QIV-ID compare TIV-ID term Grade 2 Grade 3 solicit systemic reaction combine - To demonstrate non-inferiority QIV-ID compare TIV-ID term Grade 3 solicit injection site reaction combine .</brief_summary>
