	<brief_summary>This randomise controlled trial formally compare intra-ocular lens , use cataract surgery , one standard 'monofocal ' lens , new toric lens correct astgimatism . The null hypothesis intra-ocular lens give visual outcome cataract surgery . The alternative hypothesis toric lens , provide well unaided ( without glass ) vision , correct participant 's astigmatism . It decide conduct randomise control trial two lens , although toric lens endorse many case series ( show reduction astigmatism ) , formally compare standard lens . An RCT enable formal comparison . It expect trial take approximately year conduct : six month recruitment six month follow-up . A six month require analyse data prepare manuscript publication . The investigator plan conduct interim analysis report short-trial ( six month follow-up ) use two alternative lens CE mark already widely use . Participants cataract astigmatism identify GP/optometrist referral letter . They see specially designate clinic research study , run alongside routine cataract 'one ' stop clinic St Richard 's Hospital Worthing Hospital . This allow patient wish part study necessary examination do one visit decline participation see regular cataract clinic . Potential participant send research trial information ( appendix A ) appointment letter . After introduce researcher ( also senior cataract surgeon Western Sussex Hospital Trust ) , check potential participant opportunity read trial information send , give participant copy require . The key point trial re-iterated researcher invite ask question trialThe researcher check potential participant read understood participant information leaflet . They answer question potential participant take sign consent willing participate . Only one eye ( 'trial eye ' ) patient use trial . In patient bilateral cataract , one eye select trial eye . This eye participant prefers , consultation researcher surgeon , operate first . The participant allocate unique study reference number . Patients decline take part trial offer cataract surgery per usual WSHT/NHS procedure .</brief_summary>
