	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn sotatercept help control MPN-associated myelofibrosis anemia . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Sotatercept ( ACE-011 ) Subjects With Myeloproliferative Neoplasm ( MPN ) -Associated Myelofibrosis ( MF ) Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , assign 1 3 study group , receive different dos study drug , base join study . Participants already treatment ruxolitinib assign Group 3 . - Group 1 receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 week ( low dose ) . - Group 2 receive receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 week ( high dose ) . - Group 3 receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 week ( low dose ) . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 21 day . Participant receive sotatercept clinic injection skin Day 1 every cycle . The injection give upper arm , abdomen , thigh . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle : - Participant physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , breathe rate , temperature , heart rate ) . - Participant 's spleen and/or liver measure feeling abdomen . - Participant ask drug take recent blood transfusion may . - Participant also ask new side effect medical condition may experience . - Participant 's performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test - Urine collect kidney function test . Weekly Cycle 1-5 : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant vital sign measure Day 1 Week 3 ( around Day 15 Cycle 1 ) . On Day 1 Cycle 6 , every 6-12 cycle disease responds treatment , bone marrow biopsy perform check status disease . On Day 1 Cycles 1-5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , every 6 cycle : Â° Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw antibody test pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . Antibodies create immune system may attack foreign cell substance , study drug . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : After participant 's last dose study drug , end-of-study visit follow test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature ) spleen and/or liver measure feeling abdomen . - Participant 's performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - Participant ask drug take recent blood transfusion may . - Participant also ask new side effect medical condition may experience . Follow-up Visit : About 1 month participant 's last dose study drug , receive telephone call someone study team . Participant ask drug take , recent blood transfusion may , new side effect medical condition may experience . This phone call last 10 minute . This investigational study . Sotatercept FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 60 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
