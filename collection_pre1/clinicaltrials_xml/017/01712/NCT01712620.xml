	<brief_summary>Background : - High blood pressure lung , know pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , rare disorder . In spite recent advance treatment , death rate remain unacceptably high . Lung blood vessel function harm progressive injury , inflammation , lead worsen disease . A drug call spironolactone know improve blood vessel function reduce inflammation . Some people PAH take spironolactone help treat fluid retention . However , effect inflammation blood vessel function patient withPAH know . Researchers want see spironolactone help condition people PAH . Objectives : - To test effectiveness spironolactone treat pulmonary arterial hypertension . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age pulmonary arterial hypertension . Design : - This study last 24 week . Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants take either spironolactone placebo . They take study drug placebo 7 week . Treatment monitor regular blood test . - In Week 8 , participant reaction treatment receive high dose drug placebo . - In Week 12 , participant study visit heart lung function test . They also 6-minute walk test , provide blood urine sample . - After additional study visit blood sample , participant final visit Week 24 . The test Week 12 repeated visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) rare disorder associate poor survival . Endothelial dysfunction result 1 ) genetic susceptibility , 2 ) trigger stimulus initiate pulmonary vascular injury , two-hit hypothesis , appear play central role pathogenesis progression PAH . Inflammation appear drive dysfunctional endothelial phenotype , propagate cycle injury repair genetically susceptible patient idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) patient disease-associated PAH . Therapy target pulmonary vascular inflammation interrupt cycle injury repair thereby delay prevent RV failure death test . Spironolactone , mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) androgen receptor ( AR ) antagonist , show improve endothelial function reduce inflammation . Current management patient severe PAH NYHA/WHO class IV symptom include use MR antagonist diuretic natriuretic effect clinical right heart failure develop . We hypothesize initiate therapy spironolactone earlier stage disease subject PAH could provide additional benefit anti-inflammatory effect improvement pulmonary artery endothelial function . OBJECTIVES : Patients IPAH disease-associated PAH recruit NIH enrol randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study early treatment spironolactone investigate effect exercise capacity , clinical worsening , vascular inflammation vivo . METHODS : The total number PAH subject enrol 70 . Subjects undergo 1 ) standard clinical examination include 6-minute walk distance echocardiography ; 2 ) cardiopulmonary exercise testing ; 3 ) plasma profile inflammatory neurohormonal marker ; 4 ) gene expression profile peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) ; 5 ) high-resolution MRI-based determination pulmonary vascular RV structure function . Safety tolerability spironolactone PAH assess periodic monitoring hyperkalemia renal insufficiency well incidence drug discontinuation untoward effect .</detailed_description>
