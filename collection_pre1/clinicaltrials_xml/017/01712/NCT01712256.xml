	<brief_title>Re-boosting HIV-1 Infected Subjects With Vacc-4x</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) subset T-cells critical initiating immune response infection . The level CD4 cell blood marker patient 's immunological status . During course HIV infection , number CD4 cell decrease , result reduced immunological responsiveness ultimately immune deficiency . Current management HIV infection include antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The advent effective ART 1996 lead profound decrease type 1 HIV ( HIV-1 ) -associated morbidity mortality develop country ART available . Despite ability ART inhibit HIV-1 replication , cure infection , make ART lifelong treatment require sustain compliance imposes significant individual societal financial burden healthcare service . Furthermore , ART side effect ( e.g. , metabolic toxicity stigmatize body fat redistribution ) often require medication increase inconvenience financial burden HIV management . Of additional concern emergence virus resistant ART result treatment failure . Vacc-4x peptide-based HIV therapeutic vaccine . The primary objective Vacc-4x therapeutic vaccine strengthen immune system 's response HIV p24 . ART dramatically reduce level virus circulation body , thereby allow immune system focus therapeutic vaccine administer . ART also allow generation new naïve CD4 cell trigger therapeutic vaccine generate new immune response HIV-1 . Subjects therefore immunize Vacc-4x presence ART generate new HIV-specific immune response sustain immunological fitness prolong period patient remove ART . It likely periodic boost ART require sustain immunotherapeutic effect - way ART may become intermittent therapy . This study follow-up , re-boosting study Study CT-BI Vacc-4x 2007/1 ( EudraCT Number 2007-006302-13 ) perform US Europe ( UK , Germany , Spain Italy ) . All subject include give therapeutic immunization Vacc-4x CT-BI Vacc-4x 2007/1 study . During study reduction viral load set-point ( mean viral load Week 48 Week 52 , Week 52 reach , mean viral load last two measure value restart ART ) see Vacc-4x group compare placebo group . Further stimulation immune system re-boosting Vacc-4x could reduce viral load set-point .</detailed_description>
