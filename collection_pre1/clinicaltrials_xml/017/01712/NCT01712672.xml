	<brief_summary>Background : - Dental plaque coat bacteria teeth . It contribute poor dental health disease gingivitis , cavity periodontal disease . Researchers study plaque know many different type oral bacteria stick test-tube experiment . However , clear interaction occur natural dental plaque . By study bacteria interact , researcher well understand bacteria come together grow form plaque . Objectives : - To look bacteria interact one another form dental plaque . Eligibility : - Healthy nonsmoking volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen medical history dental exam . They also dental impression take stent ( device similar Invisalign ( SqrRoot ) brace ) . - Participants wear stent 8 hour day select study visit day . It contain enamel chip make sterilized human teeth . The mouth bacteria stick chip grow . Chips take stent twice study visit day . - Participants study visit provide saliva plaque sample . They also gum swab collect bacteria . - Some participant may second set study visit . At visit , chew gum increase saliva production . Afterwards , wear stent enamel chip 4 hour . Samples stent take study visit day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dental caries periodontal disease closely associated oral biofilm know dental plaque . Much know makeup biofilm , especially early stage development ( i.e . 12 hr follow tooth clean ) . The primary initial colonizer streptococci , actinomyces . These bacteria coaggregate frequently one another mechanism involve bind protein adhesins surface one cell complementary cell surface receptor polysaccharide ( RPS ) streptococci . Coaggregation profile know wide range oral actinomyces streptococci . However , despite potential significance interaction biofilm formation , little known occurrence within oral biofilms situ . Objective The objective study determine compare influence coaggregation spatial organization bacteria supragingival dental plaque form condition normal salivary flow ( Arm 1 protocol ) increase salivary flow ( Arm 2 protocol ) . Study Population The study population consist twenty-five ( 25 ) healthy adult subject 18 year age old . All subject participate Arm 1 protocol . In addition , least three volunteer Arm 1 participate Arm 2 protocol . Study Design This observational , longitudinal protocol determine spatial organization bacteria find within dental plaque normal healthy subject . Enrolled subject standard oral examination ( include oral cancer screen ) perform NIDCR clinic protocol-listed dental clinician . A mandibular stent custom fabricate base impression take exam . Enamel chip cut previously extract third molar sterilize ethylene oxide inserted stent side molar area . We currently enough extracted third molar storage accommodate tooth chip entire protocol four subject complete study project . If additional chip need , NIDCR currently process prepare protocol provide extract teeth , need , protocol . In Arm 1 study , custom-fitted stent worn mouth subject , chip remove analysis 4 8 hour wear . The bacterial biofilm chip stain fluorescent antibody specific microbial adhesins receptor , spatial organization label cell within biofilm document laser confocal microscopy . Chips may use bacterial isolation subject ask provide saliva sample , site-specific plaque sample ( curette scraping , gum swab ) molecular taxonomic analysis . Decisions subject sample take base reactivity available antibody bacterial community . Subjects Arm 1 study choose participate Arm 2 , chew gum base 10 minute increase salivary flow wear stent . The stent individual remove 4 hour additional wear analyze . Prior participation Arm 2 protocol , subject advise experiment support CRADA agreement . Through agreement , cod research information exchange . The sample remain NIH research team . Individuals may participate first arm , arm study , indicate consent document . Outcome Measures Outcome measure protocol qualitative quantitative description oral bacterial community development initial plaque .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy adult subject ( determine selfreported medical history , evaluation study dentist nursing assessment , per policy ) . 18 year age old Good oral health determine screen oral examination : history oral cancer active periodontal disease . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History medical condition affect salivary flow , Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome History immunosuppressant therapy , glucocorticoid ( within last year ) , autoimmune immune disease ulcerative colitis systemic lupus erythematosis , current steroid therapy , topical , within last 30 day History cardiac , kidney , liver lung disorder Use tobacco within last year Use antibiotic within precede four month Use medication think affect salivary flow head/neck radiation therapy , diuretic , nitrate . Medications check product information effect review protocol dentist . Clinically visible active dental caries . Active periodontal disease define 4 site entire mouth great equal 5mm probe depth . History severe allergic reaction ( Anaphylaxis ) several allergins specific allergy substance find stent impression material ( ie : Plasticized Methacrylate Polymer , methyl methacrylate monomer , alkyl dimethacrylate , benzophenone , Toluidine Hydroquinone ) , waxes contain Pine Rosin , list ingredient impression material .</criteria>
