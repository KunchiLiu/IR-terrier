	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) characterize repetitive collapse 'obstruction ' pharyngeal airway sleep . These obstruction result repetitive hypopneas/apneas cause intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia , well surge sympathetic activity . Such process disturb normal sleep impair neurocognitive function , often result excessive daytime sleepiness decrease quality life . Furthermore , OSA associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality , make OSA major health concern . Obesity categorically major risk factor OSA , available data indicate prevalence 40 % obese men ( BMI &gt; 30kg/m2 ) 90 % morbidly obese individual ( BMI &gt; 40kg/m2 ) . Given prevalence obesity rise epidemic proportion , approximately 60 % adult consider overweight 30 % obese , become one world 's leading health care concern research priority . Importantly , prevalence obesity continue rise , number individual develop OSA . Surprisingly , despite dominant role play obesity OSA pathogenesis , precise mechanism obesity lead OSA unclear Current evidence suggest OSA pathogenesis involve interaction least four physiological trait comprise 1 ) pharyngeal anatomy propensity towards collapse 2 ) ability upper airway dilator muscle activate reopen airway sleep ( i.e . neuromuscular compensation ) , 3 ) arousal threshold sleep ( i.e . propensity hypopneas/apneas lead arousal fragmented sleep ) 4 ) stability ventilatory feedback loop ( i.e . loop gain ) . The potential mechanism obesity may alter four trait date carefully assess . Specifically , obesity suggest ) compromise anatomy decrease airway size increase collapsibility , may also b ) impair neuromuscular compensation increase mechanical load place upper airway muscle , c ) increase loop gain destabilize breathe potentially via reduction lung volume increase chemosensitivity ) increase arousal threshold thereby reduce propensity arouse sleep may offset obesity-related deficit trait . However , know obesity alters four trait ( individual ) whether involve predominantly one several mechanistic pathway . Therefore aim study determine impact obesity mechanisms underlie OSA . This achieve make physiological measurement weight-loss surgery ( i.e . bariatric surgery ) . Specifically assess : 1 . The severity OSA ( apnea-hypopnea-index AHI ) 2 . The physiological trait responsible OSA : i. Pharyngeal anatomy propensity towards collapse ii . The ability upper airway dilator muscle activate reopen airway sleep ( i.e . neuromuscular compensation ) . iii . Arousal threshold sleep ( i.e . propensity hypopneas/apneas lead arousal fragmented sleep ) . iv . Stability ventilatory feedback loop ( i.e . loop gain ) .</detailed_description>
