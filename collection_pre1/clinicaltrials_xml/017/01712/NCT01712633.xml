	<brief_summary>Background : - Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use study brain . It take series picture use look brain process information . It use study problem think , language , movement , among thing . Researchers work develop new good fMRI technique . To test technique , want perform fMRI scan healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To test different fMRI technique healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants fMRI scan brain . During scan , ask perform simple task . These task may involve language , think , motor skill . The scanning session last 2 hour . - Participants may ask return additional fMRI scan several year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) non invasive imaging technique enable scientist understand biological basis high order cognitive functioning emotion , attention , language visual processing . It use research tool since 1980 s. Recently , fMRI receive approval Center Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) use clinically believe drastically increase use clinical decision make physician near future . However , currently implement image technique technical physiologic limitation susceptibility artifact , image distortion , physiological noise , MRI induce energy deposition radiomagnetic wave typically use fMRI acquisition may potentially reduce clinical effectiveness image modality . This protocol unique technical development pilot study conduct jointly researcher National Institutes Health ( NIH ) US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) evaluate performance physiologic technical factor fMRI image method equipment may affect image quality , reproducibility , reliability clinical setting . These study important basis upon improved regulatory evaluation new functional imaging technology perform technology become increasingly used patient care future .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy volunteer , new current NIH protocol eligible . Healthy volunteer define accord history obtain report medical history , medical record ( report registration ) , MRI safety questionnaire , clinical grade noncontrast brain MRI . Willing travel NIH followup visit Greater 18 year old Able understand sign inform consent . Bilingual multilingual subject participate study long subject also fluent English . Subjects need native monolingual speaker English . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The follow criterion use exclude subject participate protocol : Implanted metal clip wire type may concentrate radiofrequency field cause tissue damage twist Magnetic field . Examples : Aneurysm clip , implanted neural stimulator , Implanted cardiac pacemaker , defibrillator , certain implanted electrical metallic device , Cochlear implant , ocular foreign body ( metal shaving ) , Any implant device ( pump , infusion device , etc . ) , Shrapnel injury , History metal head eye part body . Vagus Nerve Stimulators ( VNS ) Subjects tattoos contain metal . Pregnant woman Over 350 lbs weight limit MRI table Prior surgery may render perform MRI unsafe . Untreatable claustrophobia otherwise require anesthesia antianxiety medication may alter subject ability perform task fMRI scan . Subjects ask refrain drinking eat caffeinated food drink morning scan result vessel vasoconstriction prior scan . Any contraindication Physician identifies Subject report history , MRI Safety Questionnaire and/or medical record .</criteria>
