	<brief_summary>Background : - The human T-cell leukemia virus 1 ( HTLV-1 cause adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) . Infection immediately cause ATL , develop time . ATL rare aggressive type cancer disrupt body ability control HTLV-1 virus . It also affect growth reproduction cell infect virus . - Ruxolitinib drug approve treat bone marrow disorder . It interfere proteins important development growth ATL cell . Drugs like ruxolitinib may able interrupt important activity ATL cell . Researchers want see ruxolitinib safe effective treatment ATL . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness ruxolitinib adult T-cell leukemia . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age ATL cause HTLV-1 . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study also perform . - Participants take ruxolitinib twice day 28 day . They blood test day 1 , 14 , 28 . These test look level HTLV-1 blood . Participants final blood test 2 week later . Treatment also monitor image study . - Participants partial response treatment may able start take ruxolitinib final blood test . They continue take ruxolitinib long effective side effect severe . - Participants full response treatment take ruxolitinib 56 day , stop treatment . If ATL return , may restart treatment continue long effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoproliferative disorder characterize presence CD4/CD25 express T cell ( IL-2R alpha express ) peripheral blood , lymphoid tissue . - In smolder chronic ATL HTLV-1 encode protein , Tax constitutively activate interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-9 IL-15 autocrine/paracrine system turn activate Janus kinase ( JAK ) -1/3/STAT5 pathway . - Ruxolitinib therapeutic agent inhibits cytokine mediate JAK1/2 activation ex vivo proliferation malignant T cell patient ATL . - Ruxolitinib potent orally bioavailable JAK1/2 inhibitor . Primary Objective : - To determine clinical response rate patient smolder chronic ATL ruxolitinib administer dose 20 mg orally twice day 28 day . Eligibility - Patients great equal 18 year old pathologically confirm adult T-cell leukemia : smoldering chronic previously treat lymphomatous acute subtypes clinically indolent behavior indicate lack significant symptom treatment free interval great 6 month . - Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Patients &gt; 10 % PBMCs characteristic abnormal ( i.e. , CD3dim , CD4 plus CD25 plus express ) FACS profile circulate ATL cell consider measurable disease . - Patients symptomatic leukemic meningitis , bony GI tract involvement , serum calcium LDH &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal exclude . However patient ATL another HTLV-1 associate disease tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) include . - No prior treatment JAK inhibitor . Design - This phase II open-label , trial oral ruxolitinib enroll 20 patient smolder chronic ATL . The patient treat standard dosage schedule ( 20 mg orally twice daily ) approve FDA treatment Myelofibrosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients great equal 18 year old pathologically confirm adult T cell leukemia : smoldering chronic adult T cell leukemia define Shimoyama . Patients previously treat lymphomatous acute subtypes clinically indolent behavior indicate lack significant symptom treatment free interval great 6 month may also consider eligible . Patients must serum antibody direct HTLV1 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Patients &gt; 10 % PBMCs characteristic abnormal ( i.e. , CD3dim , CD4 plus CD25 plus express ) FACS profile circulate ATL cell consider evaluable disease . Patients must adequate physiologic parameter : Absolute granulocyte count great equal 500 K/microL , platelet count great equal 75,000 K/microL hemoglobin great equal 10 g/dL . Bilirubin creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN . AST , ALT le equal 3.0 time institutional ULN . Karnofsky Performance Score great equal 70 % ECOG le equal 1 . Patients must able understand sign Informed Consent Form . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients previously treat JAK inhibitor . Patients symptomatic leukemic meningitis , bony GI tract involvement , serum calcium LDH &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal exclude . However , patient ATL another HTLV1 associate disease tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) include . Patients receive high dos systemic corticosteroid treatment ATL within 4 week prior start therapy . Patients receive cytotoxic therapy , immunotherapy , antitumor vaccine monoclonal antibody 4 week prior start study . Life expectancy le 3 month . Documented active bacterial infection , active chronic hepatitis B evidence end organ damage dysfunction , hepatitis C HTLVII infection . A positive hepatitis B serology indicative previous immunization ( i.e. , HBsAb positive HBc Ab negative ) , fully resolve acute hepatitis B infection exclusion criterion . Patients indolent chronic hepatitis B infection ( normal ALT , AST , albumin radiographic biopsy evidence cirrhosis ) may eligible . A positive hepatitis C serology exclusion criterion . Patients untreated human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) eligible study definition defective immune response much high risk opportunistic infection due immune disregulation HTLV1 HTLVIII ( HIV ) virus . Patients HIV therapy undetectable viral load measure HIV RNA quantitative real time PCR may eligible . Pregnant breastfeeding patient eligible study effect ruxolitinib develop fetus unknown . Inability refusal practice effective contraception therapy . Men woman childbearing potential must use effective method birth control abstinence treatment 4 month completion treatment . Patient significant and/or uncontrolled cardiac , renal , hepatic systemic disorder significant psychological condition baseline visit investigator judgment would jeopardize subject enrollment compliance study procedure .</criteria>
