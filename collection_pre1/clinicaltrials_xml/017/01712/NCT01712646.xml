	<brief_summary>Background : - Oxytocin chemical brain normally produce . It play important part way humans animal act social emotional situation . Adults schizophrenia study see oxytocin reduce symptom schizophrenia , hear voice , feel suspicious , feel interested daily life . These study show oxytocin may help . However , study child develop schizophrenia . Researchers want see oxytocin , give nasal spray , safe reduce schizophrenia symptom child . Objectives : - To see oxytocin nasal spray reduce schizophrenia symptom child . Eligibility : - Children 10 year age childhood-onset schizophrenia , schizophrenia symptom spite take medication . Design : - This study last 4 week . Participants stay hospital entire period study . Participants may also extra 2 week study medication 1 week test immediately follow initial 4 week . - Participants screen physical exam medical psychiatric history . They provide blood urine sample , image study brain . They also test look social emotional functioning . These test take 1 week perform . - Participants either oxytocin placebo nasal spray twice daily 2 week . - At end 2-week period nasal spray , 1 week nasal spray . All test week 1 repeat . - The optional extra 3 week ( 2 week oxytocin one week test ) similar second , third , fourth week study . All participant oxytocin period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Recent study intranasal oxytocin administration indicate moderate efficacy symptom reduction adult patient schizophrenia , moderate good response improve social cognition patient autism . The majority ( 75 % ) patient childhood-onset schizophrenia ( COS ) continue show impair social psychotic symptom drug treatment optimization , almost 30 % child COS co-morbid autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Oxytocin may safe effective adjunctive treatment improve social cognition , reduce anxiety , indirectly reduce psychotic symptom medication-stable COS patient . Objective : To study whether intranasal oxytocin ( study medication ) would safe , improve emotional/social cognition , reduce symptom severity clinically stable COS child whether study medication would also result specific neurocircuitry change , measure multimodal neuroimaging . Study Population : 72 patient ( 36 per group ) COS , age 10 recruit . All patient stable medication least one month prior study . Design : Two-week double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel design trial daily intranasal oxytocin . Subsequent study period , two-week extension open label study medication offer participant , regardless study group assignment . Outcome Measures : Primary Outcome Measures : To evaluate safety intranasal oxytocin COS patient . To assess whether intranasal administration oxytocin improve positive negative symptom schizophrenia compare placebo , measure PANSS , SAPS , SANS , BPRS . To evaluate whether intranasal oxytocin significant effect social emotional processing behavior child COS , measure Diagnostic Analysis Nonverbal Behavior ( DANVA-2 ) , Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment ( NEPSY-2 ) standardize social perception battery , Brune Theory Mind Pictures Stories Task , Reading Mind Eyes Test . Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) . To measure alteration neurocircuitry oxytocin administration , measure fMRI , DTI , MEG . To evaluate change blood plasma oxytocin level measure course study .</detailed_description>
