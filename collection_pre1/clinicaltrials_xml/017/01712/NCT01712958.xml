	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third common cancer fourth lead cause cancer-related death world . Despite potentially curative surgery use modern adjuvant chemotherapy , 40 % CRC patient subsequently develop local tumor relapse metastatic disease . Currently , aside post-operative pathological staging , early follow patient include specific test evaluation could predict disease recurrence . Therefore , explore identify novel biomarkers CRC 's follow diagnosis primary tumor may help u identify patient high risk recurrence . Modifications signal pathway regulation microRNAs ( miRNAs ) evaluate biomarkers therapeutic target cancer general CRC particular . It establish , although completely , miRNAs role initiation progression CRC . Modifications miRNAs record CRC tumor , expression pattern miRNAs could principle biomark cancer 's phenotype . As miRNAs well documented regulate critical molecule signal pathway , regulation tumor relevant pathway may also serve sub-classify patient drug responsive group . Moreover , miRNAs may sample peripheral blood available non-invasive diagnostic method , application biomarkers special interest . In study investigator aim quantify miRNA level human colon rectal tumor , tumor adjacent normal tissue . By compare data large cohort patient , investigator aim identify specific , relevant miRNAs may serve biomarkers stratify CRC patient accord clinical characteristic disease stage , specific treatment , prognosis disease recurrence .</brief_summary>
