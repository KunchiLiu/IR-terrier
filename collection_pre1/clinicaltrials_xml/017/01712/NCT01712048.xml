	<brief_title>Submucosal Injection EMR v . Underwater EMR Colorectal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endoscopic resection benign colon polyp ( polypectomy ) play vital role prevention colo-rectal cancer . While , small pedunculated polyp remove ease , large flat lesion pose great challenge . As result , special technique develop assist removal difficult polyp . During conventional colonoscopy polypectomy , colon lumen insufflate air , flatten polyp thin wall colon . These two factor increase risk procedural complication bleed perforation . In order counter drawback technique , involve injection saline submucosal area beneath polyp , commonly use resection large flat polyp . Theoretically , injection create `` safety cushion '' reduces risk accidental ensnarement muscularis propria , lead iatrogenic perforation thermal injury deeper tissue layer . However , submucosal injection technique cumbersome patient particularly large polyp multiple injection often necessary , blur line normal abnormal tissue . Water emersion colonoscopy well-established alternative conventional `` air '' colonoscopy fact prefer many endoscopists . Studies show use water instead air decrease discomfort colonoscopy , measure amount sedative pain medication use , time complete colonoscopy , recovery time , increase cecal intubation rate . Interventional Endoscopy Services ( IES ) CPMC take concept water emersion colonoscopy one step order develop novel method `` underwater '' EMR . This technique inspire observation muscularis propria colon retain native thickness ( 1-2 mm ) circular configuration underwater EUS examination . Furthermore , water immersion `` float '' mucosal lesions away deep wall layer , eliminate need `` safety cushion '' create submucosal injection . One drawback underwater technique case poor prep , residual feces colon suspend water , interfere visualization . Additionally , use water often cause soil gurney result water seepage rectum procedure , require additional sanitary attention procedure .</detailed_description>
