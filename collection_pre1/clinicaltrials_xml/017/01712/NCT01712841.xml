	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) prevalent cause vision loss develop country often discuss term `` dry '' `` wet '' form . The `` wet '' form AMD advance form disease responsible 80 % legal blindness AMD . Treatment option include promising class biologics call anti-vascular endothelial growth factor , well photodynamic therapy laser surgery . These therapy slow vision loss , achieve recovery lose vision . The `` wet '' form AMD always precede `` dry '' form . Therefore , reasonable expect early detection treatment `` dry '' form may help reduce vision loss progression damage `` wet '' form . Unfortunately , symptom appear advanced stage `` dry '' form . As light sensitive cell macula breakdown process call geographic atrophy , patient may notice blurred central vision . OCT image technology perform non-contact cross-sectional image retinal choroidal tissue structure real time . It analogous ultrasound B-mode imaging , except OCT measure intensity reflect light rather acoustical wave . This study aim use OCT technology compare retinal anatomy blood flow differ within three severity grouping non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ( NEAMD ) .</brief_summary>

Inability maintain stable fixation OCT imaging . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g . unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . A concurrent ocular pathology may contribute vision loss ( e.g. , CNV , glaucoma , visually significant cataract , optic neuropathy , diabetic retinopathy , history retinal surgery ) interfere acquisition highquality image Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , subject become eligible . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , might affect alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc. ) . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) .
