	<brief_title>PET/CT Evaluating Response Chemotherapy Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Study fludeoxyglucose [ 18F ] 2'-fluoro-5-methyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil-clevudine ( FMAU ) ( fluorine F 18-clevudine ) 10 patient know breast cancer obtain data safety , circulate metabolite , tumor image feasibility , radiation dosimetry . II . Assess potential utility FMAU-PET imaging evaluation chemotherapeutic response 15 patient breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive fluorine F18-clevudine intravenously ( IV ) 1 minute undergo PET/CT scan baseline . Patients human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive ( HER2+ ) breast cancer also undergo fluorine F 18-clevudine PET/CT scan 2-3 week first course treatment completion treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 hour .</detailed_description>
