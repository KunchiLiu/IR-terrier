	<brief_summary>Both aerobic training ( AT ) resistance/strength training ( RT ) potential improve recovery stroke . Research conduct chronic disease healthy population suggest AT RT `` combination therapy '' may produce synergistic superior effect along cognition mobility domains , compare AT alone . However , effect combine train approach ( AT+RT ) compare AT alone investigated people post-stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Combined Resistance Aerobic Training v Aerobic Training Cognition Mobility Following Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refer Toronto Rehabilitation Institute 's Risk Factor Modification Exercise Program follow Stroke ( TRI-REPS ) randomize either AT+RT AT alone . Mobility ( 6 minute walk test ) , cognition ( Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards ) measure pre- post 6 month exercise . Secondary measure include body composition , biochemical change . This project help determine exercise treatment strategy guide best practice guideline aim promote mobility brain health people post-stroke .</detailed_description>
