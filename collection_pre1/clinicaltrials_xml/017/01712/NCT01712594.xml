	<brief_summary>Currently , patient diagnose type 1 diabetes rely either finger stick sensor glucose reading make insulin dosage decision . Designing computerized system mimic way insulin produce naturally person type 1 diabetes hold many challenge ; address one study . The purpose Medtronic Overnight Closed Loop study ass performance system design automatically infuse correct insulin dose hour patient sleep . The system consist insulin pump provide insulin patient infusion set . A sensor insert patient 's skin measure glucose level transmitter send information pump . To enable sensor register glucose information correctly , must set ( calibrate ) finger stick blood glucose 3-4 time day . In commercially release system , physician would recommend continuous background ( basal ) insulin rate patient would require make decision regard extra insulin ( bolus ) meal response high glucose level . In Closed Loop System , mobile control system add device . This consist Android phone , close loop algorithm translator . This system design translate sensor information direct pump provide require dosage insulin automatically without require input patient . Reliable calibration prove challenging , important system function safely , even calibration inaccurate . In study , calibration error introduce controlled circumstance . This test identify system maintain acceptable overnight glucose level , regardless whether calibration ideal .</brief_summary>
