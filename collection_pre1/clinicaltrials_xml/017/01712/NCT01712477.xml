	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized control pilot study traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) patient sedate either propofol midazolam compare cytokine response neuropsychological outcome without elevate blood alcohol level . Sedation part standard treatment patient TBI propose neuroprotective intervention head-injured patient . Sedative regimen , midazolam propofol , standardize unclear whether sedation significant impact recovery outcome . A review propofol versus midazolam mechanically ventilate patient show evidence provide effective sedation lack data support one sedative . Cytokines release response tissue injury act generate variety physiologic response . The cytokine elevation correlate extent tissue injury . This study compare cytokine distribution pattern specific posttraumatic time point patient TBI sedate either propofol midazolam . Additional analysis compare cytokine response patient elevate blood alcohol level normal level . Neuropsychological testing also perform determine extent brain injury recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Propofol Versus Midazolam Sedate Critically Brain Injury ; Measurement Cytokine Response Assessment Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research compare effectiveness , length time cessation sedation till extubation , recovery time , duration admission ICU , recovery brain function , cytokine response , complication rate propofol versus midazolam use sedation patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) without elevate blood alcohol level . Since type trauma patient require significant medical care upon admission emergency room ( ER ) family concern injury , patient and/or family approach research study time . At early possible time follow neurointensive ( NICU ) intensive care ( ICU ) admission , informed consent obtain patient . Depending severity head injury , patient may able sign inform consent . In case , consent obtain next-of-kin legal guardian . No intervention study research conduct patient consent obtain . Standard blood panel draw every trauma patient regardless whether patient participant research protocol , include blood alcohol level . During trauma workup ER , standard care draw extra vial case additional lab test need . After consent obtain , research team obtain extra vial Sparrow Lab perform cytokine blood cell phenotype measurement research study . Typically 0.5-1.0 ml whole blood need measurement take standardized EDTA tube drawn admission . This small amount blood sample would otherwise discard . Plasma cytokine cell phenobype IL-1 , IL-3 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-17 , TNF-¦Á , TGF-¦Â , G-CSF , GM-CSF , SCF , FGF , IGF-II perform Luminex-based mutiplex assay ELISA . In addition ER analysis , leave blood use EDTA tube 24 hour , day 3 day 7 admission . These additional measurement take routine morning laboratory blood draw do intubated patient evaluate electrolyte . No additional blood drawn research study use leave blood already draw standard care labs do intubated patient . Once consent , patient randomize treatment group random allocation process use Research Randomizer ( Urbaniak , G. C. , &amp; Plous , S. Version 3.0 Computer software ] . The patient family blind sedation give . Nurses physician blind administer sedative . Although patient receive randomize sedation , patient would administer either propofol midazolam even include research . The modification research purpose randomization sedation medication randomizer rather physician . Currently , provider research team preference one type sedation medication . Once randomize , patient allocate propofol group initiate 0.5-1 mg/kg i.v . bolus follow repeat 10-20 mg dos variable interval ( approximately 15 , discretion physician/nurse ) appropriate level sedation achieve ( NICU protocol ) , subsequently titrate achieve target Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale ( +4 = combative -5 = unarousable ) ( Sessler et al . The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale.Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002 ; 166:1338-1344 ) . Nurses note pre-sedation level base Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale . While undergo sedation , target sedation define Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale meet score -4 -5 . Patients randomized midazolam group initiate 0.5-1.0 mg incremental dosing interval approximately 1-3 min level sedation achieve target Richmond Agitation-Sedation scale sedation score ( per NICU protocol ) . Management trauma patient include careful history take alcoholism referral evaluation treatment indicate , determination whether drug also use . All patient elevate alcohol level require medical social service consultation patient TBI require neuropsychology consultation , consultation standard care . The neuropsychological testing conduct extubation also standard care . The neuropsychological evaluation measure base follow assessment : intellectual functioning , language processing , visuospatial processing , attention , concentration , verbal learning , memory , executive functioning , sensory , perception , motor , strength , personal assessment . The level impairment base scale zero seven . Data collect patient discharge hospital . The clinical record neuropsychologist review analyze progression patient 's outcome . Similar trauma patient , patient enrol study offer continue care neuropsychology well option withdrawal care competent make independent decision . Throughout study consciousness measure use Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) time presentation ER two time day patient discharge NICU ICU ( routinely do TBI patient ) . The Injury severity score ( ISS ) record admission ( do trauma patient ) . Recovery consciousness determine measurement acute physiology chronic health evaluation ( APACHE ) III modification Glasgow coma score allow score verbal component intubate patient . Patients judge awake Glasgow coma score &gt; = 12 . The follow record Sparrow medical record patient : gender , age , sex , weight , primary diagnosis , significant co morbidity , blood alcohol level admission , intracranial pressure measurement ( standard care TBI patient ) , time start finishing sedation , total amount medication give , restraint require , additional oxygen require , resuscitative measure require , time transfer unit , time discharge .</detailed_description>
