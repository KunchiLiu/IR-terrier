	<brief_summary>Background : - The drug 18F-VM4-037 test use cancer image study . It may help tumor tissue show clearly scan . Researchers want see well work scan people kidney cancer . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness 18F-VM4-037 imaging study kidney cancer . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year age kidney cancer treat surgery . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants two positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan kidney . They scan receive injection 18F-VM4-037 . The scan take 2 hour complete . - About 3 week PET scan , participant provide tumor tissue sample kidney . - This scanning study . Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Carbonic Anhydrase IX ( CA IX ) hypoxia-inducible enzyme regulate Von Hippel Lindau ( VHL ) protein commonly overexpressed certain malignancy include renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may prognostic significance . - The VHL gene commonly mutate inactivated RCC tumor VHL activity regulate expression activity CAIX also CAXII well gene critical tumor angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT1 ) , glucose transporter 3 ( GLUT 3 ) platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) . - 18F-VM4-037 imaging drug product formulation bind active site ligand CA-IX also bind CAXII . We propose evaluate 18F-VM4-037 positron emission imaging ( PET ) radiopharmaceutical vivo detection CA-IX CAXII renal tumor . STUDY OBJECTIVES PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To evaluate biodistribution 18F-VM4-037 within tumor non-tumor tissue . - To assess safety 18F-VM4-037 patient primary metastatic RCC . ELIGIBILITY : - Subject great equal 18 year old , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0-2 . - Subject must confirm primary RCC ( great equal 2.5cm ) diameter conventional imaging modality extrarenal/extrahepatic RCC lesion ( great equal 1cm ) . DESIGN : - Twenty subject primary RCC great equal 2.5cm diameter extrarenal/extrahepatic lesion suspicious metastatic RCC ( great equal 1cm diameter ) schedule clinically indicate surgery biopsy undergo dynamic 18F-VM4-037 PET/CT imaging . Results compare pathology .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subject great equal to18 year old . Subject must schedule undergo surgery biopsy primary renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) great equal 2.5cm diameter extrarenal/extrahepatic metastatic RCC lesion ( great equal to1cm diameter ) National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center base image within 3 week . Chemistry parameter : aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 2 time upper limit normal ; total bilirubin , &lt; 2 time upper limit normal &lt; 3.0 mg/dl patient Gilberts syndrome . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance score 0 2 . Ability provide inform consent . All subject must sign informed consent form indicate understanding investigational nature risk study protocolrelated study perform . The subject clinically acceptable medical history , physical examination vital sign finding screen period ( within 21 day administration 18FVM4037 ) . Components acceptable medical history include active infection time enrollment within 7 day enrollment , prior therapy result immunocompromise impaired renal function ( serum creatinine within 2 week prior positron emission tomography ( PET ) image less equal to1.8 mg/dl epidermal growth factor receptor ( eGFR ) must &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73m^2 ) finding indicate inability tolerate requirement scan . Previous exposure immunocompromising therapy exclude patient ; patient must absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5/microL within 2 week PET image . If female , must negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) within 24 hour prior 18FVM4037 injection OR post menopausal &gt; 2 year OR surgically sterile . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects participate would significantly delay schedule standard care therapy . Subjects coexist medical psychiatric condition likely interfere study procedure and/or result . Subjects severe claustrophobia unresponsive oral anxiolytic . Other medical condition deem principle investigator ( associate ) sponsor make subject ineligible protocol procedure . Female subject pregnant nursing The site target lesion must part radiation portal within 6 month enrollment . Subjects receive another investigational agent within 1 month administration 18FVM4037 .</criteria>
