	<brief_summary>Patients moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) typically reduce exercise capacity . This lungs damage increased work breathing . In patient , exercise capacity reduce level even simple activity daily live , wash dressing , may impose challenge . Recent finding healthy young people suggest increase amount nitrate diet form beetroot juice improve ability exercise . Studies involve cycle show less oxygen need perform level exercise take nitrate diet . Nitrate ( find abundance beetroot ) know convert body nitric oxide ( NO ) , substance increase blood flow may affect energy-producing mechanism inside muscle cell . A recent excite find dietary nitrate supplementation appear reduce amount oxygen need complete moderate intensity exercise ( walk ) healthy individual . It purpose study see effect could see COPD patient . If indeed case , may suggest period dietary supplementation relatively cheap , widely available , natural food product may improve ability patient undergo everyday task ultimately improve quality life . To help investigator understand effect dietary nitrate supplementation ability exercise COPD patient , investigator recruit 15 people mild moderate disease . They complete series undemanding exercise test three separate occasion . On one occasion course nitrate rich beetroot juice lead test , occasion course beetroot juice nitrate remove . The investigator monitor blood pressure , level nitrate nitrite blood , oxygen uptake functional capacity test allow u assess effect may occur result increase nitrate intake .</brief_summary>
