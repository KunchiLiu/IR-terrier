	<brief_summary>Achieving near-normoglycaemia establish main objective patient diabetes . However , well know intensification treatment associate increase frequency hypoglycemia , especially context insulin therapy . The burden hypoglycemia term psychological implication , morbidity even mortality , explains define main limiting factor achievement good metabolic control . Continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device claim useful hypoglycemia detection/prevention , allow theoretically safe intensification therapy diabetic patient . However , accuracy CGM device , especially hypoglycemic range , raise concern . In fact , commercially available CGM device estimate plasma glucose measurement interstitial fluid plasma . However , relationship plasma interstitial glucose fully understood , especially dynamic condition , may explain poor CGM performance rapid change blood glucose hypoglycemia . In project , relationship plasma interstitial glucose evaluate condition normal glucose concentration hypoglycemia . Experiments perform assess role , , different plasma insulin concentration accuracy CGM . All information obtain may relevant improvement ability CGM device detect hypoglycemia hypoglycemic risk .</brief_summary>
