	<brief_summary>The major aim research study investigate relationship genetic variation DNA ( inherited code material cell body ) factor affect transplant outcome , like drug people receive way immune system work , example . To , investigator collect blood sample participant . Genetic material separate blood sample analyze , look genetic variation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In past , major problem kidney transplantation surgical complication , acute rejection , infection . Right , researcher focus improve immune suppression therapy achieve good long-term survival kidney transplant . One way try understand cause loss function many year find genetic factor involve . There number difference specific gene identify thought affect transplant outcome . Studying gene variation ( difference people difference population ) important determine whether variation relate transplant outcome information help patient achieve good long-term transplant survival .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Kidney ( kidneypancreas ) transplant recipient 10 day posttransplant kidney donor 30 day posttransplant previously enrol Phase I Genomics Kidney Transplantation Study ; No organ kidney pancreas transplant simultaneously qualify kidney transplant ; Participant parent/guardian must able understand provide write informed consent .
