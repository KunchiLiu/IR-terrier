	<brief_title>A Trial Confirm Sustained Virological Suppression Defined HIV-RNA &lt; 50 Copies/ml 3 Different Doses Fozivudine Context Standard Zidovudine Based Antiretroviral Therapy Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluate four different oral 1st line antiretroviral regimen : three study arm contain different dos Fozivudine ( FZD ) plus Lamivudine ( 3TC ) twice daily daily application plus daily Efavirenz . The 4th study arm contain standard Zidovudine ( AZT ) /Lamivudine ( 3TC ) twice daily fix dose combination plus daily Efavirenz . The treatment duration 24 week . In pharmacokinetic Sub-Study Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) characteristic determine controlled condition sub population evaluate PK value study drug . Primary Objective The primary objective confirm sustain virological suppression ( HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml ) 24 week treatment three different dos Fozivudine ( FZD ) base antiretroviral 1st line treatment regimen context standard Zidovudine ( ZDV ) base treatment regimen non subtype B HIV-1 infected individual Africa . Secondary Objectives 1 . HIV-RNA log10 reduction HIV-RNA 2 , 4 8 week treatment different arm 2 . Virological response ( HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml ) 8 12 week treatment different arm 3 . Virological response ( HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/ml ) 8 , 12 24 week treatment different arm 4 . Immunologic response : variation CD4 lymphocytes different arm 5 . Drug toxicity , particularly anaemia , neutropenia gastrointestinal adverse event 6 . Resistance pattern patient virological failure 7 . Clinical trial capacity building African study site within FATI network 8 . Establishment Fozivudine Drug develop consortium ( NET ) include member pharmaceutical manufacturer Asia , Africa Europe . 9 . Development pilot capacity development monitor evaluation framework Pharmacological Objectives 1 . Pharmacokinetic assessment first intake study drug subset study participant ( Pharmacokinetic sub study ) 2 . Pharmacokinetic assessment steady state four week study drug subset study participant ( Pharmacokinetic sub study ) Study Population Study Duration A total 120 ART naive HIV-1 infected individual indication start antiretroviral treatment accord WHO country guideline enrol two study site Côte d'Ivoire Tanzania . Each two site enroll 60 participant ( 15 participant per arm ) . For PK Sub-Study 6 participant per study arm ( total 24 participant include . A minimum 30 % gender representation ( female male ) participant request per site . Recruitment , screen enrollment study participant expect complete 9 month . Patient treatment 24 week . So patient relate study procedure take 15 month .</detailed_description>
