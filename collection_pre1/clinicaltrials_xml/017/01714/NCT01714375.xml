	<brief_title>Daily Exposure Monitoring Prevent Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite existence OSHA standard hearing conservation , noise-induced hearing loss continue one prevalent occupational condition . Furthermore , hear loss rate appear vary significantly industrial location similar measure noise exposure level . The factor determine effective hearing conservation program remain poorly understood . The effective use hearing protection , believe critical component program , felt highly variable real world situation . Provocative new data research group indicate much preventable hearing loss large industrial workforce occur among worker high ambient noise area , instead among employee work area measure ambient median noise exposure close even slightly current OSHA action level ( 85dBA 8 hour time weighted average ) . One possible reason could use hear protection currently less effective area lower intermittent noise compare high noise area . Since many worksites , majority worker expose moderate noise level , urgent need good understand prevent hearing loss setting . There also currently national guideline ensure correct fit function hearing protection , urgent need find way promote correct use hear protective device . This study assess impact hear protector fit test daily noise exposure monitoring , major implication hear conservation practice , wide prevention noise-induced hearing loss . It also explore role hear protective device area median noise exposure less 85dBA . This propose study worksite intervention trial new technology reduce occupational noise-induced hearing loss . The intervention test effectiveness noise exposure dosimeter , QuietDose - essentially small microphone connect noise log device size beeper- measure worker 's daily noise `` dose '' , well peak noise exposure , inside worker 's hearing protector . Workers study coordinator receive daily feedback noise exposure ( device use outside study would safety personnel receive feedback outside worker ) . Such feedback allow step take minimize exposure , behavioral adjustment improve awarenessThe goal study determine whether daily assessment feedback worker ' noise exposure lead effective use hearing protection prevention noise-induced hearing loss . The propose study take advantage unique work relationship research institution ( Yale Occupational Environmental Medicine Program ) major industrial corporation ( Alcoa , Inc. ) conduct intervention trial several company 's facility .</detailed_description>
