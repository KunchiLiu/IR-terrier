	<brief_summary>Major depression highly prevalent , chronic , debilitate mental health problem significant social cost pose tremendous economic burden . Winter seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) subtype recurrent major depression involve substantial depressive symptom adversely affect family workplace 5 month year year , begin young adulthood . This clinical trial relevant public health challenge seek develop test time-limited ( i.e. , acute treatment complete discrete period vs. daily treatment every fall/winter indefinitely ) , palatable cognitive-behavioral treatment effect endure beyond cessation acute treatment prevent annual recurrence depression SAD . Aim ( 1 ) To compare long-term efficacy cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) light therapy depression recurrence status , symptom severity , remission status next winter season ( i.e. , next wholly new winter season initial winter treatment completion ) , argue important time point evaluate clinical outcome follow SAD intervention . Hypothesis : CBT associate small proportion depression recurrence , less severe symptom , high proportion remission light therapy next winter . The study design detect clinically important difference CBT light therapy depressive episode recurrence next winter , primary endpoint , intent-to-treat analysis . Aim ( 2 ) To compare efficacy CBT light therapy symptom severity remission status post-treatment ( treatment endpoint ) . Hypothesis : CBT light therapy differ significantly post-treatment outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive-behavioral Therapy vs. Light Therapy Preventing SAD Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) subtype recurrent depression involve major depressive episode fall and/or winter month remit spring . SAD affect estimate 5 % U. S. population , 14.5 million Americans . The central public health challenge management SAD prevention winter depression recurrence . The establish best available treatment , light therapy , remit acute symptom 53 % SAD case . However , long-term compliance clinical practice guideline recommend daily use light box onset first symptom spontaneous springtime remission every fall/winter season poor . Time-limited alternative treatment durable effect need prevent annual recurrence disabling symptom . Our preliminary study suggest novel , SAD-tailored cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) may efficacious light therapy alone acute SAD treatment CBT may superior outcome light therapy next winter . During next wholly new winter season follow initial winter study treatment , proportion depression recurrence significantly small participant randomize CBT ( 5.8 % ) CBT combine light therapy ( 5.2 % ) participant randomize light therapy alone ( 39.2 % ) . As next step programmatic line intervention study , primary aim propose project test efficacy CBT SAD intervention light therapy large , definitive randomize head-to-head comparison next winter outcomes intent-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis use randomized participant . This project seek test clinically meaningful difference CBT light therapy depression recurrence next winter ( primary outcome ) , thereby potential impact clinical practice . The proposed work go beyond pilot study four way : ( 1 ) This study augment generalizability prior pilot study data relax inclusion/exclusion criterion allow comorbid diagnosis stable antidepressant medication use demonstrate feasibility training experience community therapist facilitate CBT group . ( 2 ) We prospectively track recurrence potential intervening variable could affect outcome ( e.g. , new treatment , summer remission status ) interim treatment endpoint follow winter . ( 3 ) This study include second annual winter followup obtain preliminary data comparative effect CBT vs. LT two winter initial winter study treatment . ( 4 ) We examine potential modifier influence effect CBT vs. LT , include demographic variable ; baseline characteristic ( e.g. , depression severity , comorbidity , baseline medication status ) ; complete incomplete summer remission status interim . If successful , work develop novel treatment important public health implication winter depression prevention .</detailed_description>
