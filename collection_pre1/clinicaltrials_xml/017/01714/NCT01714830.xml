	<brief_summary>Chronic pelvic pain ( CPP ) affect sexes last least 3 month . CPP woman could due endometrioses , ovarian cyst , colitis , etc , make correct diagnosis important ( 1-3 ) . The prevalent reason CPP men non-bacterial chronic prostatitis many case consider equivalent ( 4 ) . Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis associate pain pelvic region could associate symptom dysuria , myalgia , arthralgia , chronic fatigue , burn sensation urethra , abdominal , urine frequency , pain ejaculation ( 4-6 ) . Chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CP/CPPS ) devided two group : III A Type ( inflammatory ) III B ( Non-inflammatory ) . The difference two group presence leukocytes prostatic secretion prostate massage , urine semen ( 7,8 ) . In general population , prevalence chronic pelvic pain syndrome 0.5 percent many patient consider symptoms disease , 6.3 % people may show symptom ( 9-11 ) . One important challenge treatment chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome , etiology obscure know multi-factorial syndrome . The proposed explanation infection , psychological reason , autoimmunity neuro-myospasm . Hypotheses endothelial cell defect cardio vascular disease also propose , upon new therapy base . In duplex mapping study prostatic vessel two group healthy chronic non-bacterial prostatitis people , show significant reduction systolic flow prostatic artery people chronic non-bacterial prostatitis , direct association pain blood flow intensity , suggest chronic ischemia possible cause pain ( 13 ) . Pain prostate without significant infection hallmark chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( 5 ) . In physical exam , prostate pelvic tenderness may observe half patient . The diagnosis chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome challenging . No specific lab test exist detection . Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level , typically increase acute infection , usually normal condition . The diagnostic approach patient base rule curable cause benign prostatic hyperplasia bladder cancer ( 14-20 ) . NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index ( NIH-CPSI ) use evaluate symptom severity response treatment patient . A reduction 4-6 point score consider significant response treatment ( 21 ) . There first line treatment patient chronic pelvic pain syndrome . The use anti-bacterial , alpha-blockers anti-inflammatory drug logical . However , patient respond , administration helpful . In non-responders , combination drug non-medical method consider ( 23-26 ) . As discuss earlier , blood flow reduction , ischemia disorder endothelium vessel may cause pain patient method improve blow flow may help ( 13,27 ) . One method extracorporeal shockwave therapy ( ESWT ) typically use tendonitis , acceleration bone reunion wound healing , improvement muscle movement reduction passive muscular tonus , increase muscular range motion cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , treatment Peyronie 's disease erectile dysfunction ( 28-30 ) . Shoskes et al compare 24 chronic prostatitis patient 11 control term vascular stiffness , index increase blood flow , vasodilation reactive vascular hyperemia , use Endo-PAT Â® 2000-Machine . They show endothelial disorder stiffness along risk cardiovascular disorder increase CP/CPPS ( 31 ) . The use ESWT treatment CP/CPPS evaluate study . In double-blind randomized control trial , Zimmermann et al place 60 patient chronic pelvic pain syndrome chronic non-bacterial prostatitis two group treat one 4 session frequency 3000 per session . The treatment group show superior result term symptom improvement ( 32 ) . In another study , Zimmermann et al follow 34 patient chronic pelvic pain syndrome , one , four twelve week post ESWT term quality life pain reduction . They show method useful without complication ( 33 ) . Considering promising result cite article along paucity data regard decide perform double-blind sham-controlled study evaluate effectiveness ESWT CP/CPPS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Extracorporal Shock Wave Therapy Patient With Chronic Non-bacterial Prostatitis / Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient sign inform consent . Bacterial prostatitis rule 2-glass test ( In method mid-stream urine sample collect ( 10 ml urine discard second 10 ml urine collect ) prostate massage do minute Digital Rectal Exam another 10 ml urine collect . After brief patient method obtain write consent , randomly allocate either treatment control group . In first group patient treat ESWT week 4 week . ( Each time 3000 impulse , 0.25 mJouls/M2 3 Hertz frequency . After 500 pulse , probe position correct , use trans-perineal ultrasound . The used device study standars electromagnetic DUOLITH SD1- shock wave erectile dysfunction . In control group , protocol apply probe turn . The examination perform supine position patient . For patient , pelvic pain intensity consider perform begin end study , VAS . Patients consider doctor NIH index begin end study . Finally , obtain data pain relief change NIH-CPSI record special profile patient finally analyze .</detailed_description>
