	<brief_summary>Incontinence one common complication radical prostatectomy . The continence rate significantly improve even robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy ( RALP ) . However , report suggest posterior reconstruction ( PR ) behind vesicourethral anastomosis could improve early recovery continence open , laparoscopic robot-assisted radical prostatectomy . But , recent prospective study report benefit PR RALP , opposite result previous study . However PR technique use prospective study seem quite different previous technique . They seem use single-step PR , oppose median dorsal fibrous raphe ( MDFR ) Denonvilliers ' fascia ( DF ) . By contrast , original technique incorporate additional reconstruction MDFR posterior bladder wall 1-2 cm new bladder neck . Our group identify anatomic structure posterior counterpart detrusor apron ( PDA ) . The PDA strong , thick functional tissue contain muscle appropriate pull fix MDFR DF . As , hypothesize key proximal structure PR DF , rather PDA . Furthermore , single-step reconstruction MDFR PDA could enough PR . We previously investigate whether new PR technique , entail opposition MDFR solely PDA , would improve continence recovery compare standard RALP technique without PR . And retrospective study demonstrate new PR technique RALP significantly shorten time recovery continence compare standard technique , incorporate PR ( Int J Urol , 2012 ; 19:683-7 ) . Thus , plan validate result well-designed , prospective , randomize control study .</brief_summary>
