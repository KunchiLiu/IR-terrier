	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer still one common malignance Korea . Because popularity regular check ups , early detection gastric cancer increase , consequently , survival patient also increase . In reason , interest outcome gastrectomy gastric cancer move survival quality life patient . Although definition metabolic syndrome various , normally accept state insulin resistance glucose intolerance combine hypertension hyperlipidemia obesity . Metabolic syndrome worldwide health problem , treatment modification life style , weight loss medication . However , patient metabolic syndrome consider curable disease . Recent study show bariatric surgery offer control overweight also metabolic syndrome . The exact mechanism still unknown decreased gastric volume intestinal bypass seem play important role improve metabolic syndrome decrease weight . For treat gastric cancer , gastrectomy essential extent gastrectomy vary subtotal total gastrectomy accord location tumor . Also , reconstruction type vary gastroduodenostomy Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy subtotal gastrectomy , esophagojejunostomy total gastrectomy . This kind operation gastric cancer lead decrease gastric volume and/or intestinal bypass , mean operation could lead similar effect bariatric surgery . Already , several retrospective report metabolic syndrome diabetes improve gastrectomy gastric cancer prospective study subject yet Korea . The purpose study evaluate degree improvement metabolic syndrome gastrectomy gastric cancer , analyze difference type operation .</brief_summary>
