	<brief_summary>The two gold standard cardiac output ( CO ) measurement , i.e. , Fick method pulmonary artery thermodilution , invasive method , require use central venous catheter Swan-Ganz catheter , respectively . With aim reduce risk patient , big research effort make investigate minimally invasive non-invasive method . Investigators seek evaluate effectiveness non invasive method estimate CO mechanically ventilate patients.The method base prolonged expiration , rely measurement gas concentration flow rate . Investigators design , realize , characterized system induce passive prolonged expiration connect patient circuit . CO calculate use algorithm base modify version Fick equation result compare one obtain thermodilution . Several advantage introduce prolonged expiration technique : non-invasive measurement , easy implementation , independency operator ability among others .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Non Invasive Estimation Cardiac Output Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective trial design assess performance non invasive method estimate cardiac output mechanically ventilate cardiac surgery patient outcome compare value obtain invasive measurement system base thermodilution . The pulmonary blood flow ( PBF ) , volume blood actively participate gas exchange per unit time , directly estimate variable technique employ calculate cardiac output . The method investigator study theoretically base application algorithm derive modify version Fick equation two different phase ; former involve measurement steady state , whilst second start sudden perturbation carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) elimination process introduce . The algorithm investigate work require analysis expire gas content normal breathe prolonged expiration , provide non-invasive estimation artero-venous content CO2 , consequently allow calculation PBF accord Fick method . At purpose , metabolic monitor use ; sample gas `` Y '' piece mechanical ventilator 's breathing circuit suction pump . In order obtain prolonged expiration , pneumatic system , ad hoc design orifice resistance ( 5 cmH2O•L-1•min ) , make experimentally characterized adapt breathe circuit application . Experimental data CO2 O2 concentration record processed measurement session thanks ad hoc develop LabView application . This application perform follow task : convert gas fraction partial pressure , segment trend partial pressure , execute data-reduction , obtain value venous carbon dioxide tension ( PvCO2 ) arterial carbon dioxide tension ( PaCO2 ) obtain , calculates CO value use mention algorithm . The value calculate non invasive method show good agreement one obtain thermodilution precision comparable minimally invasive technique .</detailed_description>
