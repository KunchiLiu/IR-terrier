	<detailed_description>Background : The interactive effect resistance training dietary protein hormonal response overweight obese adult clear remain controversial . Investigators test effect isocaloric high-protein diet body composition , ghrelin , metabolic hormonal parameter 12-week resistance training program untrained overweight healthy young men . Methodology : Investigators randomize 18 healthy young male standard diet ( ST group ) isocaloric high protein diet ( HP group ) . They participate weight-management program previous 6 month . An open-label design use . At enrolment , participant randomly assign one two group : control group standard diet ( total calorie 2,400 kcal/day , 60 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein 25 % fat ; ST group ) interventional group isocaloric high protein diet ( total calorie 2,400 kcal/day , 55 % carbohydrate , 30 % protein 15 % fat ; HP group ) . Participants group take part schedule resistance exercise training program . Participants take part resistance train program competitive sport study duration . At start study , participant instruct maintain assign diet throughout study period . This assess use food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) 24-h recall 12 week . Participants present two-dimensional food picture actual size portion computer single trained dietitian minimize interviewer bias . Medium define portion size show , small approximately half medium portion size , large one-and-a-half time medium portion size . Exercise Protocol All participant supervision participation progressive supervise resistance exercise-training program . They participate onsite supervise protocol 12 week ( 6 day per week ) . Exercise duration increase gradually , 50 min week 1 80 min week 12 , include warm-up 20 min cool-down period 10 min carry gentle stretching exercise upper low limb . A one repetition maximum ( 1-RM ) maximum weight lift one complete repetition movement . For participant , RM calculate particular muscle group . Each movement carry 60-80 % 1-RM . Resistance increase slowly three step ; step 1 ( 60-70 % 1-RM week 1-4 ) , step 2 ( 65-75 % 1-RM week 5-8 ) step 3 ( 70-80 % 1-RM week 9-12 ) . Baseline Follow-up Measurements Height bodyweight measure use digital scale examinee wear light gown , shoe . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight ( kg ) divide height square ( m2 ) . The percentage body fat total fat mass measure bioelectric impedance analysis ( Inbody 3.0 ; Biospace Co. , Ltd. , Seoul , Korea ) , sensitive test quantification change lean fat mass vivo assessment regional fat distribution . A mercury sphygmomanometer use measurement blood pressure ( BP ) participant , sit position , 10-min resting period . Two reading systolic diastolic Bps record 3-min interval , average measurement include analysis . Blood sample obtain preprandially 0.800 hour participant 's antecubital vein 12-h fast , use determination plasma glucose , insulin , lipid profile , total ghrelin , GH , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , testosterone cortisol . Blood sample obtain baseline ( prerandomization ) 12 week randomization .</detailed_description>
