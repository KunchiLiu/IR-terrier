	<detailed_description>Background The increased frequency diagnose pediatric bipolar disorder emerge one great controversy child adolescent psychiatry . Beginning report 20 % prepubertal child Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) meet criterion juvenile mania , view arise bipolar child irritable euphoric chronic episodic , compare typical adult . Concurrently , 4 6-fold increase inpatient discharge 40-fold increase office-based visit pediatric bipolar disorder , although many fail meet formal Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM ) criterion . Concerns raise child impulsive , volatile behavior apt diagnose bipolar . Some attempted inform valid symptomatic boundary propose differentiation narrow versus broad pediatric bipolar phenotype . The narrow phenotype define strict DSM criterion mania hypomania , include discrete episode grandiosity euphoria . In contrast , broad phenotype , also refer severe mood dysregulation ( SMD ) , define chronic , non-episodic illness lack hallmark symptom grandiosity euphoria , typify severe irritability hyperarousal . Work National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) demonstrate patterns adolescent irritability stable distinct , episodic irritability lead mania simple phobia , chronic irritability lead diagnosed depression ADHD . On structured assessment , child SMD highly comorbid major depression ( 20 % ) , anxiety ( 64 % ) , oppositional defiant disorder ( 83 % ) , ADHD ( 87 % ) . Others also find increase rate ADHD anxiety . In addition , broad narrow phenotype could differentiate accord electroencephalography ( EEG ) measure . SMD youth impair face emotion recognition deficit correlate dysfunctional family relationship less influenced emotional distracters task attention . A recent study reveal pattern amygdala hypoactivation similar depression , support link chronic irritability subsequent depressive episode . In response perceive over-diagnosis pediatric DSM bipolar disorder , acknowledgment `` classic '' adult bipolar phenotype occur prepubertal youth , increase recognition SMD distinct behavioral and/or biological syndrome , DSM-5 Child Disorders Workgroup propose new diagnostic category name temper dysregulation disorder dysphoria ( TDD ) . Criteria TDD largely base SMD , however , requirement hyperarousal remove minor change make age onset exclusion criterion . Unlike SMD , TDD lack demonstrate scientific basis history prior research . As , seem prudent time continue research better-established SMD category expectation information derive ready applicability work TDD progress . One preliminary report suggest SMD lifetime prevalence 3.3 % among ages 9-19 . Recent longitudinal study indicate child SMD increase rate adult mood anxiety disorder , substance abuse , suicidality , poor overall functioning . Given significant morbidity , essential investigator increase understand child chronic irritability affective instability . Impulsive aggression childhood identify significant public health concern cut across currently define diagnostic category . These youth demonstrate increase difficulty school adjustment , peer interaction , cognitive deficit , problem-solving , physical abuse - developmental trajectory predictive significant adult dysfunction . Current community practice emphasize use second-generation antipsychotic agent child impulsive aggression . While risperidone proven effective irritability associate pervasive developmental disorder [ 25,26 ] second-generation antipsychotic effective pediatric bipolar disorder , agent associate significant weight gain metabolic effect . Use medication associate decreased utilization psychosocial intervention . Given relationship SMD ADHD , anxiety , unipolar depression , investigation drug class target effect well side effect profile , mood stabilizer , antidepressant , stimulant , certainly warrant . In fact , DSM-5 Workgroup specifically call clinical trial state `` critically important '' ass whether stimulant SSRIs first line treatment SMD-affected youth . The published medication trial SMD youth double-blind placebo control study lithium conduct intramural group NIMH , fail demonstrate effect . Other informative investigation include small positive study methylphenidate versus placebo ADHD plus oppositional defiant disorder aggression , open-label stimulant follow adjuvant divalproex vs. placebo ADHD aggression , stimulant augmentation double-blind risperidone versus placebo ADHD treatment resistant aggression . These study notably heterogeneous design choice outcome measure . No clear predictor response report . Most exist SMD research conduct single intramural group NIMH . It imperative investigation SMD expand research group ensure result generalize broad clinical setting . Additional research require delineate clinical phenomenology inform subsequent effort diagnostic classification . Further work also necessary establish appropriate foundation future clinical intervention research . This include pilot study various medication class might prove useful management SMD , well examination various outcome measure likely useful medication psychosocial intervention trial . Overview The study include comprehensive phenotyping 65 patient meet criterion SMD , include assessment comorbid psychopathology , language disorder , neurocognition , EEG . Potential endophenotypes diagnostic boundary assess relation large exist database child adolescent internalize externalize disorder , well non-clinical control . Eligible participant SMD proceed pilot study sequential pharmacotherapy initial 4-week titration open label lisdexamfetamine ( LDX ) follow 8 week adjunctive therapy randomize fluoxetine placebo . Statistical analysis address diagnostic boundary SMD compare disorder emphasize initial determination potential efficacy tolerability stimulant SSRI treatment SMD . There added emphasis effect size estimate determination optimal outcome measure anticipation future large-scale study . Project Visits Procedures At baseline , visit 1 , 2 eligible participant undergo open-label stepwise titration one week low , medium , high dose LDX . The study physician may modify titration due emergent side effect follow routine practice standard . At visit 3 , clinician determine `` optimal '' stimulant dose base review parent teacher-completed Conners Global Index scale available adverse event side effect data , use procedure similar use study . Participants remain optimal stimulant dose remainder study , unless side effect necessitate downward dose adjustment . At visit 4 , participant fail achieve CGI-I-SMD score great equal 2 randomize double blind adjunctive treatment either fluoxetine placebo . A forced dose , stepwise , upward titration one week 5 , 10 , 20 mg fluoxetine/placebo occur visit 4 , 5 , 6 . The treat physician may modify titration schedule response emergent side effect follow routine practice standard . Participants remain visit 6 dos fluoxetine/placebo study 's final visit , unless side effect necessitate downward titration . Side effect , adverse event , medication compliance assess visit . Major outcome assessment occur baseline , visit 4 , 12 . Arrangements make transfer participant standard clinical care follow visit 12 . One month visit 12 , family contact telephone final assessment residual adverse event ongoing medication use .</detailed_description>
