	<brief_summary>When kidney cancer spread beyond kidney , know metastatic kidney cancer . This difficult treat almost patient die disease within 3 year . Sunitinib become standard therapy untreated patient metastatic clear cell renal ( kidney ) cancer . It target growth factor know VEGF important treat renal cancer . Although result drug impressive , patient develop resistance drug , relapse die renal cancer . It currently standard practice treat patient everolimus resistance sunitinib occur ; associate clear clinical benefit . However median time progression everolimus 4.9 month previously treat patient , therefore improvement treat patient require . The optimal way achieve increase efficacy everolimus add agent directly target cause resistance sunitinib . Dovitinib promise new drug renal cancer . Dovitinib block cellular function activation downstream signalling molecule , cell proliferation survival . Combining dovitinib everolimus attractive . This trial aim establish maximum tolerate dose combination dovitinib everolimus clear call renal cancer , take randomised phase II study . A maximum 30 patient recruit multi centre national trial . Expansion Cohort : The study establish MAD MTD . The MTD Cohort 0 ( Everolimus 5mg Dovitinib 200mg ) . 6 patient recruit cohort 1 patient experience DLT . A 3 patient recruit Cohort 1 ( Everolimus 5mg Dovitinib 300mg ) , 2 patient experienced DLT . A total 7 assessable patient recruited expansion phase MTD ( Cohort 0 : Everolimus 5mg Dovitinib 200mg ) define safety , tolerability , efficacy , PK biological end point . Assessable patient expansion cohort define study minimum 6 week . Any patient enrol assessable replace .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Investigating Everolimus Dovitinib Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell cancer , also refer kidney cancer , diagnose approximately 170,000 people worldwide annually , result 82,000 death . Treatment metastatic kidney cancer difficult . Almost patient die disease . In 2006 new drug call sunitinib , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , transform treatment option . It target development new blood vessel within cancer . Although result drug impressive , patient develop resistance median 11 month drug , relapse die renal cancer . It currently standard practice switch everolimus resistance sunitinib occur ; associate clear clinical benefit . However median time progression everolimus 4 month previously treat patient , therefore improvement treat patient require . The optimal way achieve increase efficacy everolimus add agent directly target cause resistance sunitinib . dovitnib promising new drug pharmacology data variety vitro vivo study dovitnib provide preclinical rationale clinical evaluation dovitinib patient metastatic clear cell renal cancer . The combination everolimus dovitnib target 3 major protagonist associate tumour growth The main risk burden patient participate study potential side effect trial medicine , two drug use combination together although safety data drug , know safety data drug use combination . The first cohort patient receive 200mg dovitnib 5mg everolimus . In previous study drug administer separately high dos . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) dovitnib 5-day on/ 2-day dosing schedule define 500mg/day previous Phase I study . In RECORD-1 study ( Phase III double blind randomise trial investigate everolimus ) dose 10mg use . Cohorts three patient treat dose level . A minimum 14 day elapse first patient treat cohort enter next patient . Further patient may enter concurrently . Toxicity assess accord NCI CTCAE v4.0 ; dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) occur dose escalation undertaken next cohort patient . In event DLT 1out 3 patient cohort expand maximum 6 patient . If equal 2 6 patient experience DLT dose escalation halt maximum administer dose ( MAD ) reach . If less equal 1 6 patient DLT dose escalation may continue . Patients may personally benefit study . However information gain study might help treat future patient metastatic kidney cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histopathologically confirm clear cell renal carcinoma measurable metastasis CT/MRI imaging ( component clear cell histology require ) . 2 . Patients must progression stop treatment VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( sunitinib and/or sorafenib ) 3 . Prior vaccine therapy treatment cytokine ( ie IL2 , Interferon ) and/ VEGF ligand inhibitor ( bevacizumab ) permit . 4 . Minimum 18 year age ( upper age limit ) 5 . Radiological progressive disease . 6 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 7 . Prior exposure target therapy within previous 4 month . Targeted therapy consist VEGF target agent mTOR inhibitor . A gap least 2 week therapy require prior study entry ( gap least 6 week bevacizumab ) . 8 . Evidence measurable disease ( ie , ≥1 malignant tumour mass accurately measure least 1 dimension ≥ 20 mm conventional computerized tomography [ CT ] scan Magnetic Resonance Imaging [ MRI ] , ≥10 mm spiral CT scan use 5 mm small contiguous reconstruction algorithm ) . Bone lesion , ascites , peritoneal carcinomatosis miliary lesion , pleural pericardial effusion , lymphangitis skin lung , cystic lesion , irradiate lesion consider measurable . 9 .
