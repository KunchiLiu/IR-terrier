Symptoms related mild TBI result cognitive , functional , emotional impairment lead vocational social disability . Long-term cognitive deficit include problem memory attention , importantly executive functioning . Depressive post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms extremely common individual cognitive impairment , occur 50 % 33 % individual , respectively .

Therefore , investigator propose conduct three-group randomize control trial determine efficacy Goal Management Training ( GMT ) , structure manual-based intervention target executive function impact person 's ability carry daily task . The investigator hypothesize telephone-based GMT improve cognitive functioning , functional status , psychological health trauma survivor mild TBI . Emerging research suggest telephone rehabilitation feasible effective alternative ( much broad applicability ) clinic-based intervention . Trauma survivor mild TBI limit access rehabilitation service due financial constraint mobility geographic restriction render clinic-based rehabilitation impractical . This clinical trial recruit 90 trauma survivor mild TBI cognitive deficit executive functioning . Eligible participant randomize either 10-week ( 1 ) telephone-based GMT ; ( 2 ) telephone-based attention-control ; ( 3 ) usual care . Primary outcome include observed self-reported executive function self-reported functional status measure battery standardize previously validate cognitive test instrument , include Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Tower Test , Dysexecutive Questionnaire , Functional Activities Questionnaire .
