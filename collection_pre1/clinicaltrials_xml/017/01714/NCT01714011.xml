	<brief_summary>Introduction : Schizophrenia serious mental illness . For majority patient lifetime condition , characterize intermittent episodes hospitalization due relapse acute symptom exacerbation . The nature course disorder impose significant social economic burden . Relapse costly , hospitalization account substantial portion healthcare expense . Second generation antipsychotic side effect metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus contribute additional cost treatment . Many study since provide convincing evidence high risk diabetes glucose abnormality , metabolic syndrome mortality due elevate cardiovascular risk patient schizophrenia . However many study show effectiveness safety aripiprazole ziprazidone.In one study , aripiprazole show improvement negative schizophrenic symptom 25 % 50 % function level baseline . In term safety , antipsychotic consider safe metabolic profile amisulpride , ziprasidone aripiprazole . Study objective : - To investigate safety efficacy ziprazidone versus aripiprazole treatment schizophrenia patient metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus . - To investigate reversibility metabolic syndrome diabetes parameter follow treatment ziprazidone versus aripiprazole . Hypotheses : * The proportion reversibility metabolic syndrome diabetes parameter higher follow treatment ziprazidone aripiprazole .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Schizophrenia devastate mental illness impairs mental social functioning often lead development comorbid disease . Metabolic abnormalities historically associate illness schizophrenia . Many study since provide convincing evidence high risk diabetes glucose abnormality , metabolic syndrome mortality due elevate cardiovascular risk patient schizophrenia . These metabolic abnormality major clinical concern direct somatic effect morbidity mortality also association psychiatric outcome , high prevalence psychotic depressive symptom , low functional outcome , bad perceive physical health , low adherence medication . Effective pharmacologic treatment schizophrenia available since 1950s . The first-generation antipsychotic increase risk extrapyramidal side effect , dystonic reaction ( example , fix upper gaze , neck twisting , facial muscle spasm ) , parkinsonian symptom ( example , rigidity , bradykinesia , shuffle gait , tremor ) , akathisia ( example , inability sit still , restlessness , tap foot ) . The term `` atypical antipsychotic '' refers newer antipsychotic confer less risk extrapyramidal side effect traditional antipsychotic . Although new atypical antipsychotic associate few neurologic side effect , high risk metabolic side effect diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , weight gain . This effect independent development diabetes ; exact mechanism atypical agent might cause diabetes unknown . Few drug aripiprazole , sertindole , amisulpride ziprasidone find promising effect lower metabolic syndrome . The study design : 1 . Identify safer treatment high efficacy schizophrenia . The efficacy ziprasidone treatment schizophrenia demonstrate short-term long-term control trial . Ziprasidone show comparable haloperidol , olanzapine risperidone alleviate overall psychopathology , improve associate depressive symptom cognitive function schizophrenia . Ziprasidone generally well tolerated trial , weight-neutral profile , limited discontinuation related adverse event . Ziprasidone exhibit low incidence weight gain , one analysis suggest carry low liability weight gain atypical agent . In open-label study , patient whose medication switch ziprasidone conventional antipsychotic , risperidone , olanzapine exhibit improvement lipid profile . Ziprasidone also demonstrate low incidence extrapyramidal symptom low risk prolactin elevation . It associate modest prolongation ( &lt; 10 millisecond ) correct QT ( QTc ) interval electrocardiography ( ECGs ) obtain short-term , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled trial evaluate dos 200 mg/day . A study evaluate QTc interval maximum steady-state plasma concentration demonstrate 9-14-msec great increase QTc interval ziprasidone four atypical antipsychotic , include olanzapine . The clinical relevance magnitude change unclear . No excess risk cardiac sequela observe clinical development program ( package insert Geodon [ ziprasidone ] , Pfizer Inc. , New York , 2002 ) . Published data regard efficacy aripiprazole treatment schizophrenia indicate superiority placebo comparability risperidone , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) total Clinical Global Impression Severity ( CGI-S ) improvement score . In study , aripiprazole demonstrate favourable safety tolerability profile , little propensity weight gain adverse metabolic effect . 2 . Improving clinical practice This study provide finding clinician use later management schizophrenia especially prognosis patient . The aim achieve good outcome minimise side effect especially cause development comorbidity . Second-generation ( atypical ) antipsychotic become first-line medication treatment schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , large part due consistently reduce association movement disorder comparable efficacy conventional agent . Direct comparison among atypical agent , however , limited . In contrast earlier atypical antipsychotic agent , ziprasidone aripiprazole share reduce propensity weight gain metabolic dysregulation . Given obesity dyslipidemia highly prevalent probable contributor elevate rate morbidity premature mortality among individual schizophrenia , new atypical agent offer potential improve health outcome population . Obesity threat health longevity . Given one-third adult United States obese , practice cause major weight gain deserve careful consideration . Obesity weight gain associate hypertension , type II diabetes , coronary heart disease , stroke , gallbladder disease , osteoarthritis , sleep apnoea respiratory problem , type cancer ( endometrial , breast , prostate , colon ) . Moreover , obesity common concomitant schizophrenia , schizophrenic individual appear increase risk certain obesity-related condition type II diabetes cardiovascular disease . Weight gain may also cause patient take antipsychotic medication discontinue medication , may predispose relapse . Historically , extrapyramidal side effect antipsychotic outweigh non-extrapyramidal side effect . With advent new `` atypical '' antipsychotic , extrapyramidal side effect become less problem . For drug , degree weight gain , estimate random effect regression 10 week , range 0.04 kg ziprasidone ( significantly different zero ) 4.45 kg clozapine . Among five new atypical antipsychotic study ( ziprasidone , risperidone , sertindole , olanzapine , clozapine ) , ziprasidone low weight gain ( 0.04 kg ) clozapine high ( 4.45 kg ) . This study determine whether antipsychotic-associated metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus reverse switching aripiprazole ziprazidone . Currently data available issue .</detailed_description>
