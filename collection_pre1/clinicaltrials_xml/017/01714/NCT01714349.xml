	<brief_title>Nerve Transfer After Spinal Cord Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment strategy acute cervical spinal cord injury remain limited . Treatment option provide meaningful improvement patient quality life long-term functional independence provide significant public health impact . Specific Aim : Measure efficacy nerve transfer surgery treatment patient complete cervical spinal cord injury hand function . Optimize efficiency nerve transfer surgery evaluate patient outcome relation patient selection optimal timing surgery . Hypothesis : Peripheral nerve transfer patient spinal cord injury improve hand function provide improvement patient quality life functional independence .</detailed_description>
