	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate effect treatment post-op wound infection long bones fracture fixation joint fusion either : ( Group 1 ) operative debridement PO antibiotic treatment 6 week ; ( Group 2 ) operative debridement IV antibiotic 6 week . Primary Hypothesis : The rate treatment failure one year Group 1 non-inferior rate Group 2 . Treatment failure define wound problem require surgery &gt; 2 week initial debridement , infection recurrence , infection new pathogen , joint erosion , implant failure , medical problem relate treatment administration necessitate switch one arm .</brief_summary>
