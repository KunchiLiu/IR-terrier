	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare heal difference two metal ( trabecular vs. standard titanium ) use dental implant . In addition ; investigator examine difference gene expression profile subject three condition associate delayed healing : diabetes osteoporosis . The study last least 11 week consist 6 appointment . All visit carry GO Health Center within UNC School Dentistry . Visits last 30 minute 3 hour depend particular visit . The visit consist : Obtaining consent , health history , measure vital sign , dental exam teeth gum , collect sample saliva dental radiograph ( X-rays ) , teeth cleaning , 4 temporary mini test cylinder place area low jaw teeth miss implant surgery place four permanent implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dental Implant Study Comparing Two Types Metals Used Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plan recruit subject 3 group : 1 ) systemically healthy , 2 ) subject diabetes ( ADA classification determine glycosylated hemoglobin A1C level ) , 3 ) subject osteoporosis ( limited either drug oral bisphosphonates ) . All subject recruit already approve treatment plan implant placement non-study personnel avoid potential conflict interest . All subject mandibular radiograph show edentulous ridge area provide enough alveolar ridge space place two test cylinder ( approximately 2.9-3 x 5mm ) side mandible . One side two titanium test cylinder contralateral side two trabecular metal test cylinder . After placement 4 test cylinder , one remove contra laterally side week 2 4 healing . Thus , 28 day test cylinder remove . It experience cylinder removal contain enough cell provide approximately 10-20μg total RNA . This quantity total RNA sufficient run Affymetrix chip enough mRNA PCR confirmation . Sampling 3 day placement soon , provide adequate mRNA analysis , since clot become remodel adequately organize cellular . Thus , 1 week organization osseous heal begin week 2 beginning mature . The week 2 sampling time point ) provide u early molecular kinetics heal response compare two metal surface difference gene expression may associate diabetes osteoporosis . At week 2 4 test cylinder remove use 5.0 mm diameter tissue punch 5 mm trephine drill . Investigators select 18 random patient ( 6 subject per group ) provide ( two test cylinder , 36 sample ) histology . Investigators use trephine drill remove 4 week test cylinder 3 group subject . In case , subject eligible study pretreatment plan receive permanent implant bilaterally , place donor site . According participant 's individual treatment plan , test cylinder remove , site receive implant use either standard 4.1 4.7 mm taper screw vent design implant . The removed test cylinder briefly rinse saline prepare chair side either mRNA extraction histology .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must adult male female age 21 80 year ( inclusive ) . Subjects must able willing follow study procedure instruction English . Subjects must read , understood sign informed consent form English . Subjects must least four mandibular implant future treatment need . Subjects must meet one follow category consider enrollment : Group 1 ( control ) : Subjects must nondiabetic , history smoking within last two year metabolic bone disease diagnosis . Group 2 ( diabetic ) : Subjects must Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed physician medication history . The condition must currently diagnose treat medication and/or insulin . An HbA1C test perform either within past 3 month must available one do first visit study personnel . Subjects must history smoking within last two year diagnosis metabolic bone disease . Group 3 ( Osteoporosis osteopenia ) : Subjects must diagnose osteoporosis osteopenia must currently care physician treatment oral bisphosphonates . Subjects must never intravenous ( IV ) bisphosphonates . Subjects group must nondiabetic history smoking within last 2 year . Subjects undergoing test cylinder placement adequate periodontal health prior implant placement . This include probe depth ≤ 4 mm remain teeth quadrant propose cylinder placement . Patients periodontal probe site probe depth 5 mm may also include bleed probe site absent . Each subject consider periodontally stable prior receive test cylinder . Individuals chronic disease oral manifestation . Individuals exhibit gross oral pathology . The use either antibiotic chronic use NSAIDs within 1 month prior screen examination . Individuals require antibiotic prophylaxis prior dental treatment . Chronic treatment ( i.e . two week ) medication know affect periodontal status ( e.g . phenytoin , calcium antagonist , cyclosporine , Coumadin ) within 1 month prior screen examination . Systemic condition , except diabetes , osteoporosis osteopenia know affect periodontal status . Individual uncontrolled parafunctional habit , clench bruxing object , could adversely impact implant survival Individuals history intravenous bisphosphonates Individuals active infectious disease hepatitis , HIV tuberculosis . Individuals current tobacco use history . Individuals know pregnant , breastfeed plan become pregnant within 3 month . Individuals blood disorder /or currently take anticoagulant medication , unless provide current International normalized ratio ( INR ) show normal ( 0.8 2.0 ) value . Individuals receive therapy know affect healing , high dose corticosteroid , radiation therapy chemotherapy . Individuals allergic topical local anesthesia</criteria>
