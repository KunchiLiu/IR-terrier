	<brief_summary>Warfighters often experience physical overload , uniform associate gear carry burden substantial load . The loads increase energy expenditure level exceed Warfighter 's typical energy intake . The typical assault load approximately 25 kg , although load high 55 kg often carry , combine extreme energy expenditure degrade health performance , increase risk injury . Branched-chain amino acid ( leucine ) supplementation may confer protection negative effect operational stress stimulate muscle protein synthesis reduce degradation . This study determine leucine-enriched nutrition supplementation confers protection negative consequence sustain load carriage exercise , explore mechanism leucine might impart protection .</brief_summary>
