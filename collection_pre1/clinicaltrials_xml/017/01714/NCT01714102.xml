	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome serious health condition affect 35 percent adult place high risk cardiovascular disease , diabetes , stroke disease related fatty buildup artery wall . The underlying cause metabolic syndrome obesity , overweight , physical inactivity genetic factor . In recent decade , prevalence increase dramatically United States . Lifestyle intervention include dietary modification , physical activity weight loss form basis treatment patient . However , research show even people able incorporate change , often revert back usual lifestyle result weight gain continue risk diabetes heart disease . Resveratrol , natural plant derive compound find grape , peanut red wine , find reverse feature metabolic syndrome ( insulin resistance , high triglyceride , high blood pressure ) rodent . These improvement occur without weight loss , proven direct result resveratrol ingestion . Other study reveal improvement cardiovascular health , tumor suppression , longevity . However , study investigate beneficial effect human . In systematic review resveratrol research , author conclude `` contrast lacking data resveratrol human , animal data promise indicate need human clinical trial . '' Of small clinical study do , result encourage . Improvement triglyceride , blood pressure insulin resistance note . Resveratrol well tolerate without serious side effect . These study , however , recruit subject metabolic syndrome , tightly control . The investigator propose prove resveratrol , administer subject metabolic syndrome , control condition weight stability , common diet , strict compliance study drug , improve symptom metabolic syndrome , thereby decrease chance develop diabetes heart disease .</detailed_description>
