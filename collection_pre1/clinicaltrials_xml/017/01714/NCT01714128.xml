	<brief_summary>A significant number invasive breast cancer hormone sensitive may candidate treatment hormonal therapy . This project assess ability usefulness image hormone-receptor status breast cancer positron emission tomography ( PET ) 6α- [ 18F ] fluoro-17β-estradiol ( FES ) , estrogen analogue patient schedule treated hormonal therapy give combination selective allosteric inhibitor AKT protein kinase ( MK2206 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 75 % invasive breast cancer hormone sensitive [ estrogen-receptor positive ( ER+ ) progesterone-receptor positive ( PR+ ) ] patient cancer candidate endocrine therapy . Endocrine therapy central component treatment hormone-sensitive breast cancer adjuvant , increasingly , neoadjuvant setting . Knowledge hormone receptor expression essential selection appropriate therapy . Measurement hormone-receptor expression [ estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) ] use vitro assay tumor tissue time primary diagnosis standard clinical care . However , presence hormone receptor predict clinical benefit 30-50 % woman advance disease receive first-line endocrine therapy 15-30 % receive second-line therapy ( 1-3 ) . Thus , presence hormone receptor indicate receptor functional essential growth cancer cell , imply interference receptor function result tumor cell kill . There several shortcoming vitro assay neither quantitative qualitative receptor assay perform sample tumor tissue completely predict response antiestrogen therapy breast cancer . In addition , none current clinical tool ( serology , prognostic factor , radiologic study ) accurately predict clinical benefit endocrine therapy . Accordingly , good method predict clinical response antiestrogen therapy need develop .</detailed_description>
