	<detailed_description>Study Groups : Dose Escalation Group : If find eligible take part study , assign either Arm A Arm B base join study , disease type , drug take past . Up 5 dose level study drug test arm . Up 6 participant enrol dose level arm A B . The first group participant Arm A receive FDA approve dose crizotinib plus low dose level dasatinib . The first group participant Arm B receive FDA approve dose dasatinib plus low dose level crizotinib . Each new group receive high dose study drug combination group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . The dose level study drug combination receive may lower intolerable side effect . Dose Expansion Group : After high tolerable dose level study drug combination arm find , 10 additional participant enrol dose expansion group receive high dose study drug combination tolerate dose escalation group . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . All participant take dasatinib mouth 1 time day . You take drug alone Day 1 Cycle 1 , first day receive study drug combination . Then start Day 2 Cycle 1 , begin take crizotinib mouth 1 time daily , 1 time every day , 2 time daily depend dose level study drug assign . You take dasatinib crizotinib least 1 hour meal . Study Visits : You study visit Days 1 15 Cycle 1 , begin new cycle ( every 28 day ) . At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may . Blood/Tumor Samples Imaging Scans : If dose expansion group : - On Day 1 cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test take first dose study drug . PD test measure level study drug body may affect disease . - If one first ten patient enrol cohort , take Dasatinib first day treatment ( Day -1 Cycle 1 ) . On Day -1 Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood ( ½ teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test take drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 hour take drug . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - If one first ten patient enrol cohort , Day 1 Cycle 3 beyond , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) drawn PK test take study drug . - If one first 10 patient enrolled cohort , biopsy screen Cycle 1 . The type biopsy base type disease . The procedure , risk , discuss detail . All study participant : - On Week 3 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - On Day 28 cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . During Week 4 Cycle 2 every 2-3 cycle : - You CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or bone scan check status disease . The actual type scan depend type scan take screen . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur unable follow study direction . If disease get bad , may eligible continue take study drug . The study doctor discus . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET scan check status disease . This investigational study . Dasatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment leukemia . Crizotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment lung cancer . The combination dasatinib crizotinib currently use research purpose . Up 176 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
