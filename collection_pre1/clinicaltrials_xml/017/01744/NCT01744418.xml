	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy novel , tissue-engineered vascular prosthesis , Human Acellular Vascular Graft , HAVG . The HAVG intend alternative synthetic material autologous graft creation vascular access dialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Efficacy Vascular Prosthesis Hemodialysis Access Patients With ESRD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HAVG sterile , non-pyrogenic , acellular tubular graft compose human collagen natural extra-cellular matrix protein . Upon implantation , anticipate ( base pre-clinical study ) collagen-based matrix comprise graft infiltrate host cell re-modeled host . This result vascular structure similar histological composition native vascular tissue may improve graft longevity less likely become infect .</detailed_description>
