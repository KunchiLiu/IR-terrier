	<brief_summary>In study investigator evaluate sensitivity PCC2 ( PillCam Colon Capsule 2 ( R ) ) identify significant polyp CRC ( Colo Recatal Cancer ) screen program ( primary outcome measure ) . Each enrol patient underwent three procedure : colon capsule endoscopy , CT-colonography optical colonoscopy . In study reference standard represent segmental unblinded colonoscopy ( unblinding base result capsule endoscopy Ct colonography ) The investigator also evaluate tolerability PCC2 compare optical colonoscopy ( OC ) CT-colonography ( CTC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asymptomatic average risk subject positive iFOBT ( immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Test ) , participate regional screening program , offer undergo PCC2 ( PillCam Colon Capsule 2 ( R ) ) follow , 21 day later , CTC OC perform day . The number , size location significant polyp ( &gt; 6mm ) identify procedure compare reference standard ( RS ) , represent segmental unblinded colonoscopy . The unblinding base integration CTC PCC2 result . For PPC2 quality bowel preparation ( adequate/inadequate ) completeness examination ( capsule excrete still work visualization anal verge ) also report . In order evaluate tolerability , subject ask identify , among 3 procedure perform , less tolerate one one would willing repeat .</detailed_description>
