	<brief_summary>In context improve survival HIV infection , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ; form lung disease include emphysema , make breathe difficult ) emerge important cause morbidity perhaps ultimately mortality population . HIV-infected patient increase risk chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , likely due multiple factor , include increase presence smoking , chronic inflammation progression immunodeficiency , oxidant stress ( excessive level natural chemical call oxidant free radical damage tissue ) , respiratory infection . While natural history data COPD limit era potent antiretroviral therapy , early data suggest course emphysema may accelerate population . Our preliminary data suggest several matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) derive alveolar macrophage ( type immune cell find lung ) increase cellular response HIV-infected smoker , could contribute accelerated emphysema . Matrix metalloproteinases enzymes break structural support tissue , include airway lung . Based observation , investigator hypothesize pharmacologic inhibition matrix metalloproteinases doxycycline favorably modify natural history chronic obstructive pulmonary disease HIV-infected patient . To test hypothesis , investigator propose conduct proof concept pilot study prelude possible phase II randomize , placebo-controlled trial ( test safety efficacy large population control `` sugar pill '' ) doxycycline COPD HIV-infected patient proof concept successful . Our research team lead pulmonologist/researcher expertise HIV-associated COPD infectious disease specialist/clinical trial expert .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) emerge important cause morbidity HIV-infected patient , likely due multiple factor , include increase prevalence smoking , chronic inflammation immune activation , oxidant stress respiratory infection . Our preliminary data suggest several lung matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) upregulated HIV-infected smoker , could contribute accelerated emphysema virtue ability degrade extracellular matrix basement membrane component . Our Specific Aim determine safety , tolerability , biologic effect twice daily doxycycline 6 month HIV-infected subject COPD . To address aim , conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study doxycycline 100 mg twice daily 30 HIV-infected subject COPD ( 2:1 doxy : placebo ) . The primary endpoint safety/tolerability secondary endpoint include change FEV1 , reduction MMP activity epithelial lining fluid cell obtain bronchoscopy doxycycline level blood , ELF bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cell pellet . In addition provide novel insight biologic effect doxycycline lung , pilot study inform selection endpoint phase II trial , ultimately address unmet medical need novel intervention COPD/emphysema HIV-infected patient .</detailed_description>
