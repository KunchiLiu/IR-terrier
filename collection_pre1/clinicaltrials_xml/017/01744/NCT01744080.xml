	<brief_title>Rotator Cuff Injury Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consented patient undergo pre-operative assessment conduct study physiotherapist , include follow : 1 ) demographic information ( age , gender , height , weight , smoke status , employment , recreational activity , time injury , etc . ) ; 2 ) shoulder ROM , 3 ) shoulder strength use handheld dynamometer , 4 ) subjective shoulder-specific outcome measure include Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Score ( WORC ) , American Shoulder Elbow Score ( ASES ) , Simple Shoulder Test ( SST ) . Measurement tear size also document experienced radiologist initial MRI ultrasound . Patients undergo initial consultation orthopaedic surgeon confirm suitability surgical management . If deem appropriate continue participant , individual participant randomize one two study group . If Expedited group , patient proceed rotator cuff repair surgery within 3 month initial consult sport medicine physician . If randomize Control 'Typical Wait Time ' Group , surgery take place earlier 9 month later 12 month sport medicine physician consult . Just prior surgery , second diagnostic image test take place , either ultrasound MRI , document progress tear size secondary pathology control group . Diagnostic test finding confirm intraoperatively . All rotator cuff repair perform one four fellowship train orthopaedic surgeon . The control study group send subjective questionnaire 8 week interval wait surgery . Post-surgery study follow-up take place 6 , 12 , 24 month group . All patient provide rehabilitation protocol include pain management , range motion strengthen exercise . The data collect pre-surgery repeat well occurrence failure repair . Failure repair define ongoing severe pain , limited ROM , and/or decrease strength . If failure occur , follow-ups continue 24 month follow failure 24 month follow revision surgery , perform .</detailed_description>
