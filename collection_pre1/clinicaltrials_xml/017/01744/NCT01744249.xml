	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm well moderately differentiate neuroendocrine carcinoma ( grade I II WHO 2010 ) nonpancreatic origin 2 . Ki67 &lt; 20 % 3 . Metastatic locally advance disease ( clinically radiologically confirm ) amenable treatment curative intent 4 . Progressive disease document prior 12 month ( RECIST criterion ) 5 . Measurable disease 6 . Prior treatment somatostatin analogue permit 7 . Prior interferon therapy allow 8 . One prior systemic chemotherapy allow 9 . No prior VEGF VEGFRtargeted therapy allow 10 . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500 cells/mm3 ; platelet ≥75,000 cells/mm3 ; hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL ; AST ALT ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless liver metastasis case AST ALT ≤5.0 x ULN ; total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ; serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min ; urinary protein &lt; 2+ urine dipstick . If dipstick ≥2+ 24hour urine collection do patient may enter urinary protein &lt; 2 g per 24 hour . 11 . Male female , age ≥18 year . 12 . ECOG performance status 02 . 13 . Life expectancy ≥12 week . 14 . At least 4 week since end prior systemic treatment , radiotherapy , surgical procedure resolution treatmentrelated toxicity NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 grade ≤1 back baseline except alopecia hypothyroidism . 15 . No evidence preexist uncontrolled hypertension document 2 baseline blood pressure read take least 1 hour apart . The baseline systolic blood pressure reading must ≤150 mm Hg , baseline diastolic blood pressure reading must ≤90 mm Hg . Patients whose hypertension control antihypertensive therapy eligible . 16 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 3 day prior treatment . 17 . Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . 18 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan study procedure . 1 . The following endocrine tumor type may include : paraganglioma , adrenal , thyroid , parathyroid pituitary endocrine tumor . 2 . Major surgery &lt; 4 week radiation therapy &lt; 2 week prior start study treatment . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion irradiate . 3 . Gastrointestinal abnormality include : inability take oral medication ; requirement intravenous alimentation ; prior surgical procedure affect absorption include total gastric resection ; treatment active peptic ulcer disease past 6 month ; active gastrointestinal bleeding , unrelated cancer , evidence hematemesis , hematochezia melena past 3 month without evidence resolution document endoscopy colonoscopy ; malabsorption syndrome . 4 . Current use anticipate need treatment drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( ie , grapefruit juice , verapamil , ketoconazole , miconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , telithromycin , clarithromycin , indinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , lopinavir , atazanavir , amprenavir , fosamprenavir delavirdine ) unless substitute different medication minimal inhibition CYP3A4/5 . The coadministration could reduce plasmatic concentration axitinib . 5 . Current use anticipate need treatment drug know CYP3A4/5 inducer ( ie , carbamazepine , dexamethasone , felbamate , phenobarbital , phenytoin , amobarbital , nevirapine , primidone , rifabutin , rifampin , St.John 's wort ) unless substitute different medication minimal inhibition CYP3A4 . The coadministration could reduce plasmatic concentration axitinib . 6 . Requirement anticoagulant therapy oral vitamin K antagonists . Lowdose anticoagulant maintenance patency central venous access devise prevention deep venous thrombosis allow . Therapeutic use low molecular weight heparin allow . 7 . Active seizure disorder evidence brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . 8 . A serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability receive study treatment . 9 . Any follow within 12 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , uncontrolled angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack 6 month deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism . 10 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . 11 . History malignancy ( renal cell cancer ) except treat curative intent skin cancer ( melanoma ) , situ breast situ cervical cancer , treat curative intent cancer evidence disease 5 year . 12 . Dementia significantly alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent compliance requirement protocol . 13 . Female patient pregnant lactating , men woman reproductive potential willing able employ effective method birth control/contraception prevent pregnancy treatment 6 month discontinue study treatment The definition effective contraception agreement local regulation base judgment principal investigator designate associate . 14 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
