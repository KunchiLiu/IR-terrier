	<brief_summary>Overall goal study scrutinize relation learn behavior relate brain activity development alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . The researcher aim characterise representative sample ( 200 men age 18 ) regard learn parameter respective neural correlate think indicator risk develop alcohol use disorder . As part large multi-center study alcohol dependency ( Dresden &amp; Berlin , Germany ) researcher characterize sample prospectively assess alcohol consumption development AUDs period three year . Among hypothesis expect increased activation striatal prefrontal brain region Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer process relate increase risk develop AUD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hazardous alcohol use alcohol use disorder ( AUDs ) extremely prevalent industrialized country , affect 6 million individual Germany alone . The onset case occur adolescence early adulthood . Therefore , targeted prevention would desirable especially young people high risk develop AUDs . Since knowledge predispose factor limit , project aim identify mechanism underlie liability dysfunctional alcohol consumption ( i.e . hazardous alcohol use , alcohol abuse alcohol dependence ) . Based hypothesis addiction disorder due aberrant learning , researcher expect inter-individual difference learn behavior associate liability well resiliency AUD . To test hypothesis , researcher characterize 200 men age 18 , prospectively assess alcohol consumption development AUDs period three year . At baseline , researcher study three cluster predictive variable : ( ) individual learn parameter , estimate computational modeling behavioral performance learn task Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer , probabilistic reversal learning , habitization-devaluation ; ( ii ) individual neural correlate learn , assess functional brain image learning ; ( iii ) already establish risk factor family history alcoholism impulsivity . The specific aim test set related hypothesis . The researcher assume high risk AUD baseline ( cross-sectional design ) , increase alcohol consumption 3 year incidence progression AUD follow-up ( prospective data ) associate decreased reward sensitivity , decreased punishment sensitivity , increase Pavlovian approach behavior ( 'sign track ' ) , increase 'go ' effect condition appetitive stimulus , increase habitization , increase activation striatal prefrontal brain region Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer process , decrease correlation striatal brain activity prediction error reversal learning .</detailed_description>
