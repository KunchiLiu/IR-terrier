	<brief_title>Music Therapy Methodist Homes : Study Investigating Impact Music Therapy Programme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While music therapy note effective intervention decrease agitation disruptive behaviour adult dementia ( Livingston et al , 2005 ) , effect demonstrate immediately session , arguably due progressive nature dementia . To achieve long-lasting therapeutic change , seem necessary consider specific element work music therapy , extract use within activity . It hypothesise use element within additional activity care provision , alongside regular music therapy session , may result decrease resident ' BPSD long duration time . Little research carry specifically identifies key element music therapy contribute efficacy within field dementia . This study aim support exist evidence highlight significance use music therapy within dementia care , , importantly , identify element principally involve produce change behaviour level well-being . The study also incorporate collection dementia resident ' physiological data , specifically Electrodermal Activity ( EDA ) , therapy session . This measure record participant ' level skin conductance ( microSiemens/cm ) ; control Sympathetic Nervous System roughly think Fight Flight system . Many effort make explore skin conductance indicate level emotional arousal , example , high skin conductance indicate excitement stress ; low skin conductance indicate sadness calmness . ( Poh et . al. , 2010 ; 2012 ; Van Dooren et . al. , 2012 ) . The skin conductance data propose help identify key element observable phenomenon videoed music therapy session show reduced presentation BPSD . If current study able identify element , finding enable future research investigate comprehensively transplanted activity optimise effect . Participants recruit two residential Methodist Homes , use cluster randomize control design , allocate either control group intervention group . Participants control group receive standard daily care 22 week . Participants intervention group , addition daily standard care , receive one session individualise active music therapy week period 22 week . Music therapy session last 30 minute . During session participant wear ' Q-sensor ' device around wrist , record skin conductance level . Each session video-recorded . A communication system employ therapy session , video clip session demonstrate participant engage interaction expression present care staff . This process aim demonstrate staff Behavioural Psychological Symptoms Dementia ( BPSD ) minimise music therapy technique , possible cause BPSD , therapist make use participant ' remain ability enhance facilitate involvement interpersonal communication within session . The primary outcome measure Neuropsychiatric Inventory , standardise questionnaire use assess psychopathology dementia patient . This carry resident ' keyworkers follow time point : baseline measure 2 week prior commencement music therapy intervention period , week 11-12 , week 21-22 follow-up week 27-28 . There three secondary outcome measure : 1. dementia care mapping , observational tool use ass quality care deliver staff . This carry baseline 2 week prior commencement music therapy intervention ; week 11-12 ; week 21-22 ; follow-up week 27-28 . 2. microanalysis video recording music therapy session , conjunction data participant ' arousal level session , measure skin conductance device worn wrist . This take place week music therapy session duration 22 week intervention period . 3. grounded-theory base interview . These carry care staff week 23 25 explore carers ' perception music therapy . Further analysis video recording session conduct follow completion 22-week period music therapy treatment investigate key moment within session .</detailed_description>
