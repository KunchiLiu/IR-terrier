	<brief_summary>Historically , transthoracic Doppler echocardiography unable provide interpretable data blood flow within lung parenchyma air attenuation Doppler signal . Recently , transthoracic Doppler system know Sonara/tek Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) System develop identify parenchymal pulmonary blood flow ( PPBF ) signal . The ability non-invasively collect information regard pulmonary aspect cardio-pulmonary system may provide valuable information new insight structural functional characteristic lung parenchyma vasculature health disease state .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Blood Flow Patterns Lung Blood Vessels Using Ultrasound Technique Patients With Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This new system previously study among 31 healthy volunteer one subject atrial fibrillation.1 Pulsed spectral Doppler signal obtain chest wall use signal processing algorithm package conjunction non-imaging Doppler device couple electrocardiogram . Clear reproducible lung Doppler signal ( LDS ) originate different element phase cardiac activity generate mechanical wave propagate throughout lung express pulsatile change ultrasound reflection . After completion first 25 patient pilot study , receive valuable information . After assess patient CHF pulmonary hypertension , identify signal particular CHF group . There unique feature never observe normal patient . On top regular Lung Doppler signal see normal patient , high velocity `` disorganize '' variable signal synchronous heart beat , rather sometimes respiration observe . We believe signal may represent pop open small bronchus surround `` water fill '' parenchyma . These event generate strong reflector like signal may represent movement fluid blood vessel-alveolar air junction .</detailed_description>
