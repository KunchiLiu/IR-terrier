	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Stage III-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) clinically appropriate dose human heat shock protein ( hsp ) 110-gp100 chaperone complex melanoma vaccine ( recombinant hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine ) recommend phase II dose stage IIIB/C stage IV metastatic melanoma patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect recombinant human hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine measurable clinical tumor . II . To determine gp100 hsp110 specific cell mediate humoral immune response elicit chaperone complex vaccine . III . To determine effect dose serial administration chaperone complex vaccine cell mediate humoral immune response . IV . To quantify patient characteristic ( human leukocyte antigen [ HLA ] subtype , immune cell function , etc . ) may correlate immune response chaperone complex vaccine . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive recombinant hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , 15 , 43 absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
