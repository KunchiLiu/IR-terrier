	<detailed_description>This Phase I , randomise , double-masked , placebo-controlled eye drop administration study rh-NGF healthy male female subject . This study consist single ascend dose part ( part 0 one drop single application ) . Then single ascend dose part ( part A ; one drop three time day ) multiple ascend dose part ( part B ; one drop three time day five day ) . All part study consist 3 ascend dose level . In order support dose escalation MAD phase Covance , Basel Covance , Leeds , additional cohort ( 0M ) conduct Covance , Leeds dose level cohort 1M ensure degree consistency two site , i.e . dose escalation stop criterion meet either site . In Part 0 , ascend dose cohort include 3 subject treat one dose rh-NGF . In part A , ascend dose cohort include 6 subject treat rh-NGF 2 placebo . In part B , ascend dose cohort include 9 subject treat rh-NGF drug 3 placebo , addition cohort 0M , include 3 subject treat rh-NGF 1 placebo</detailed_description>
