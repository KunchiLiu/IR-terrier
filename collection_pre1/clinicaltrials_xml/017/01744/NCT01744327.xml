	<brief_summary>TL1A newly discover signal molecule may crucially involved maintenance chronic inflammatory disorder . TL1A also demonstrate psoriatic skin importance TL1A psoriasis still unknown . Understanding inflammatory signal molecule psoriasis important development new drug direct relevant signal molecule ( e.g . TNF-Î± IL12/23 ) prove efficacious treatment principle . However , despite dramatic progress therapeutic option last decade , still fraction patient insufficiently treat currently available therapy . TL1A claim next important target development biologics field chronic inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TL1A Expression Psoriatic Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis common autoimmune disease ; affect approximately 2 % western population . Among 15 % estimate severe disease require systemic therapy e.g . methotrexate , cyclosporine acitretin drug associate high frequency side-effects . In contrast recent development biologic drug provide efficacious general well-tolerated new therapeutic . But even new drug treatment-failures exist group new treatment need TNF-like ligand 1A ( TL1A ) novel member TNF family cytokine . Increasing evidence suggest addition TNF-alfa IFN-gamma psoriasis also IL-23 IL-17 dependent disease TH1 TH17 T cell suggest important driving disease . Therefore TL1A , bind DR3 influence TH1 TH17 T cell differentiation , could important cytokine early inflammatory process psoriasis . Recently expression TL1A psoriatic skin lesion demonstrate importance remains investigate . TL1A exist membrane bound- soluble form secrete antigen present cell ( APCs ) monocytes , dendritic cell macrophage response stimulation immune complex , bacteria cytokine ( TNF-alfa IL-1beta ) . Membrane bound TL1A also describe T cell . Recently , new isoform soluble TL1A ( TL1A ( V84-L251 ) ) discover functional difference TL1A ( L72-L251 . It 's unknown whether isoform present psoriatic skin . Research TL1A focus autoimmune disease immune complex form , e.g . rheumatoid arthritis . However , study suggest early pathogenesis psoriasis could dependent formation large complex bacterial DNA anti-microbial peptide LL-37 induce cytokine secretion APC . Cytokines could lead TL1A excretion . Whether TL1A secrete way unknown .</detailed_description>
