	<brief_title>Safety/Effectiveness Study Cysteamine Bitartrate Delayed-release Capsules ( RP103 ) Cysteamine Treatment Naive Patients With Cystinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study gather information safety effectiveness ( well work treat cystinosis ) new drug call RP103 . In cystinosis , body build cystine . When take regularly , active ingredient older , already approve drug call Cystagon® ( cysteamine bitartrate ) reduce cystine body . RP103 active ingredient Cystagon® design reduce cystine similar way Cystagon® . RP103 also different Cystagon® : Instead cysteamine bitartrate absorb stomach , RP103 design absorbed small intestine . This may make effect drug last longer , take twice day instead four time day like Cystagon® . To decide RP103 effective , study look two type blood test . One test pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , measure amount white blood cell ( WBC ) cystine take study drug . WBC cystine laboratory test use find cysteamine bitartrate reduce cystine level body . The second test pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , measure amount cysteamine blood take drug .</detailed_description>
