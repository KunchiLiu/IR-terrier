	<brief_summary>Physical activity exercise become accept valued component Cystic Fibrosis care . Regular physical activity exercise slow rate decline pulmonary function , improve physical fitness , enhance quality life . However , motivate people active challenge . Supervised exercise program expensive labor intensive , adherence fall significantly supervision end . Unsupervised partially supervised program less costly flexible , compliance problematic . The primary objective study evaluate effect 12-months partially supervise exercise intervention along regular motivation force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) large international group cystic fibrosis patient . Secondary endpoint include patient report quality life , well level anxiety depression , control blood sugar . A total 292 patient cystic fibrosis 12 year old FEV1 ≥35 % predict recruit . Following baseline assessment ( 2 visit ) patient randomize intervention control group . Thereafter , see every 3 month assessment centre one year ( 4 follow-up visit ) . Along individual counseling increase vigorous physical activity least 3 hour per week clinic visit , intervention group document daily exercise inactivity time receive step counter record progress web-based program . They also receive monthly phone call study staff . After 6 month , continue step counter web-based program 6 month . The control group receive access intervention 12 month standardize care . Should relatively simple program prove successful , make available wider scale internationally .</brief_summary>
