	<brief_summary>Abnormal limb trunk movement see many child cerebral palsy . Recognizing difference type movement well understood . This study aim describe common movement child recruit population-based sample child identify cerebral palsy register , explore association motor ability . It hop lead improve understanding recognition movement disorder CP , allow clinician choose appropriate treatment . We hypothesise underlie prevalence dyskinesia high previously identify conventional motor description cerebral palsy population Australia , may approach 20 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A key descriptor associate term cerebral palsy `` disorder development movement posture , result activity limitation . '' The term `` movement disorder '' commonly use describe range observe abnormal movement posture displayed child chronic neurological condition , cerebral palsy ( CP ) common . These child muscle tone abnormality relate non-progressive damage motor pathway , particular contain within cortex , basal ganglion thalamus . In recent year much focus understand treat abnormal tone movement child CP , include spasticity dystonia . Spasticity , occur approximately 90 % child CP define velocity-dependent resistance muscle stretch . In general , spasticity elicit standard clinical examination , passive range joint motion perform vary speed . Dystonia childhood define `` movement disorder involuntary sustain intermittent muscle contraction cause twist repetitive movement , abnormal posture , . '' . In contrast spasticity , dystonia inherently difficult observe measure , particularly spasticity co-exists . When classified accord dominant form tone abnormality , account 2-15 % case . However often overlook diagnostic formulation motor aspects cerebral palsy , therefore necessarily figure treatment decision-making . Under-recognised dystonia , co-existent spasticity , produce unpredictable surgical outcome management gait disorder associate musculoskeletal deformity . In addition , abnormal movement chorea athetosis may observe child , add complexity movement disorder , rarely classified dominant abnormality . Improving recognition dyskinesia , situation co-exist spasticity , important promote clearer description tone movement abnormality , also help tailor appropriate treatment lead improved outcome . In recent study describe motor profile 247 5-year-old child South Australian CP population , 93.2 % child cod primarily spastic-type ; 3.2 % dyskinetic ( dystonia athetosis ) 3.6 % ataxic.1 However study also find child assess face-to-face group expert paediatrician , 19.4 % population note observation alone abnormal movement , include dyskinesia . This increase motor severity Gross Motor Functional Classification System ( GMFCS ) 7 % ( level I ) 45 % ( level V ) . We question whether fact recognition dyskinesia `` masked '' presence spasticity , accord conventional clinical descriptor . We advocate development classification system describe spasticity dystonia parallel , aid clinician prescribe treatment strategy . To date publish study systematically examine prevalence abnormal movement CP population , beyond determine dominant form tone abnormality mutually exclusive fashion , e.g . spasticity dystonia . Our study propose mutually inclusive format use recently validate tool recognition dystonia abnormal movement .</detailed_description>
