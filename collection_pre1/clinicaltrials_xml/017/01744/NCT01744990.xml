	<detailed_description>Food allergy child disease grow importance , current estimation school age child 4 8 % . The frequently involve food IgE reaction school-aged child hazelnut ( especially Switzerland accord ongoing Swiss Registry , Wiesner et al , personal communication ) peanut . Tree nut peanut allergy often involve severe reaction , include case death anaphylaxis . In addition , disease long-lasting Fleischer et al could show 9 % child nut allergy outgrow . This number bad peanut positive outcome see 20 % patient . Food challenge reliable test investigate possible food allergy , time consuming may elicit severe reaction patient previous history anaphylactic reaction ( 8 ) . There allergy test able time predict certainty clinical reactivity , although Sampson et al could identify general tree nut specific IgE cut-off level high positive predictive value clinical reactivity . It could demonstrate , well-designed study , vitro cross-sensitivity tree nut ( member oleaginous family ) peanut ( member legume family ) frequent ( 86 % ) . However , clinical reaction tree nut estimate present 40 % peanut allergic patient . Therefore 60 % peanut allergic patient may eat tree nut without reaction . Similarly , large vitro cross-sensitivity tree nut . However , know date cross-sensitivity relate clinical reactivity . Consequently , case one tree nut allergy , strict eviction nut largely recommend , possibly result unnecessary dietary eviction tree nut lead high impact quality life child . We aim identify , base standardize food provocation test , nut allergic patient need selective , complete dietary eviction kind nut ( nut define peanut , tree nut , pine nut sesame ) . We postulate predictive factor multiple nut allergy high specific immunoglobulin E level , positive skin test and/or clinical marker , atopic dermatitis , presence food allergy history severe previous reaction .</detailed_description>
