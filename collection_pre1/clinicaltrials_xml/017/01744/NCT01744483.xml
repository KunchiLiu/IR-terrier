	<brief_summary>Researchers look three different type breathe tube see well prevent pneumonia others . Two tubes design feature prevent leakage fluid mouth throat lung . This importance , since leakage small amount fluid lung may lead pneumonia . The third tube standard tube use hospital . The hypothesis use breathe tube reduces fluid leakage lung reduce risk develop pneumonia , compare standard tube . The study also look safety modify breathe tube , compare standard tube . This study small , `` pilot '' study determine possible perform large study provide certain result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endotracheal Tubes Prevention Ventilator-associated Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective pilot study provide data plan establish feasibility perform large , randomize , comparative effectiveness trial two specially design airway tube ( endotracheal tube ; ETTs ) prevention ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . Modification material design ETT cuff position trachea , and/or continuous aspiration subglottic secretion extra port position tube cuff vocal chord may prevent leakage contaminated secretion around cuff thereby reduce risk VAP . The investigator plan phase III , randomize , control trial compare effectiveness polyurethane-cuffed endotracheal tube ( PUC-ETT ) , polyurethane-cuffed tube also allow continuous aspiration subglottic secretion ( PUC-CASS-ETT ) , conventional , polyvinylchloride-cuffed endotracheal tube ( PVC-ETT ) mechanically ventilated patient respiratory failure . Prior initiate Phase III trial , small pilot study necessary order establish feasibility gather data endpoint order establish enrollment rate project sample size definitive trial . For purpose plan , surrogate VAP , bacterial colonization trachea assess daily quantitative culture allow estimation effect size two study device . VAP diagnose use objective criterion , base culture bronchoalveolar lavage . The safety profile tube evaluate use multi-faceted approach , include short-term objective measure laryngeal dysfunction long-term subjective objective assessment upper airway problem via phone interview post-hospital discharge , record device-related adverse event .</detailed_description>
