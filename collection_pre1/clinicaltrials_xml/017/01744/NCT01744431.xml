	<brief_summary>Can thrombin generation measurement predict risk venous thromboembolism acute ill patient Traditional coagulation test assess whole coagulation system . Thrombin generation assay measure ability plasma sample generate thrombin follow vitro activation coagulation . In contrast classical clotting assay , thrombin generation reflect integrate pro anticoagulant reaction regulate formation inhibition thrombin . The aim study investigate whether thrombin generation would able predict hypercoagulable state acute ill patient admit internal medical department correlate Padua prediction score , score could assist risk venous thromboembolism hospitalize medical patient . In total 300 patient plan inclusion trial . After sign informed consent blood sample obtain participant . We measure thrombin generation time plasma assess calibrate automated thrombogram ( CAT ) .</brief_summary>
