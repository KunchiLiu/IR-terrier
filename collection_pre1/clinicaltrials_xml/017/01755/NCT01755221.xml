	<brief_summary>The purpose research study well understand whether information obtain pH probe help physicians predict whether patient respond medication prescribe laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) . The current treatment give individual diagnose LPR course proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) medication . Subjects agree participate study small flexible tube ( width piece cook spaghetti ) place throat . This tube measure pH throat period 24 hour help physician study relationship pH level , LPR symptom , effectiveness PPI therapy . This study may help physician find certain symptom characteristic help predict PPI medication effective patient . After probe removal , subject receive compensation . They return clinic regularly schedule follow-up visit physician , 8 12 week start PPI medication . At time , subject choose participate optional probe placement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose research study well understand whether information obtain pH probe help physicians predict whether patient respond medication prescribe laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) . The current treatment give individual diagnose LPR course proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) medication . This medication reduce amount gastric acid produce generally lead symptom relief . In order study whether pH probe help physician predict patient respond PPI therapy , physician measure pH level patient ' throat start PPI medication . Subjects agree participate study small flexible tube ( width piece uncooked spaghetti ) place throat . The physician place tube nose tip back throat , high enough patient feel talk , eat , drink , swallow . This tube measure pH throat period 24 hour help physician study relationship pH level , LPR symptom , effectiveness PPI therapy . This study may help physician find certain symptom characteristic help predict PPI medication effective patient . After probe removal , subject receive compensation . They return clinic regularly schedule follow-up visit physician , 8 12 week start PPI medication . At time , subject choose participate optional probe placement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients present evaluation symptom classically associate LPR Reflux Symptom Index ( RSI ) great equal 13 . The common symptom associate LPR include hoarseness , throat clearing , globus sensation , nocturnal laryngospasm , postnasal drip , chronic cough , dysphagia . Symptom duration great 1 month Ages 1889 Preexisting PPI therapy indication within two week DxpH probe placement visit Presence finding alternative diagnosis explain symptom e.g . : laryngeal mass , objective post nasal drainage Contraindication PPI therapy ( i.e . : atrophic gastritis , liver problem , severe bloody diarrhea antibiotic , osteoporosis , break bone ) unwillingness initiate PPI therapy Pregnancy : There contraindication Restech pH probe pregnancy ; however , PPI use pregnant woman contraindicate thus pregnant woman would ineligible participate study would unable complete course omeprazole . Unwillingness inability undergo 24 hour pharyngeal pH probe monitoring ( example , oxygen wear requirement prevents probe placement anatomical preclusion like septal perforation ) . Bleeding disorder and/or unable stop use anticoagulant aspirin , Coumadin ( warfarin ) , and/or Plavix ( clopidogrel )</criteria>
