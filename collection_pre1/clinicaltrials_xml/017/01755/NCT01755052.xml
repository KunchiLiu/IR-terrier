	<brief_summary>SILVER-AMI research study old person admit hospital heart attack . Patients interview hospital 6 month later . The researcher also collect detailed medical record information understand effect heart attack old person . The research team Yale University use information develop risk model use help doctor predict recovery . The goal study help old people future make well-informed decision health care heart attack .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SILVER-AMI : Outcomes Older Persons With Heart Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective study develop validate risk stratification tool old adult recently Acute Myocardial Infarction ( AMI ) . While emerge interest understanding role geriatric condition pertain cardiovascular outcome , standard , feasible assessment old patient AMI stratify risk subsequent morbidity mortality . Currently available risk model design solely predict clinical event ( e.g . mortality , reinfarction ) . This insufficient share decision make old patient , consistently rate maintenance favorable health status top priority . This study address gap meld principle geriatrics cardiology create post-AMI risk model specifically design old patient . This study significant old person AMI grow , yet understudied , population . Dr. Sarwat Chaudhry Yale University conduct multi-center , observational study design collect data post-AMI recovery period use generate risk model older patient AMI . The intent study use knowledge data collect SILVER-AMI ultimately design intervention improve care outcome old patient AMI . Study coordinator screen old patient hospitalize AMI . Participants assess baseline prior AMI hospital discharge interview , physical assessment medical record review . One follow-up interview conduct approximately 6 month later Yale Follow-up Center . Clinical outcome assess follow-up period occur 6 month post AMI hospitalization self-report medical record review .</detailed_description>
