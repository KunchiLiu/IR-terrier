	<brief_summary>Background : - Cabozantinib cancer treatment drug block growth new blood vessel tumor . It also block chemical tumor cell allow cell grow . A similar drug , pazopanib , use treat type cancer know sarcoma . Researchers want see cabozantinib effective treatment type soft tissue sarcoma respond early treatment . Objectives : - To test effectiveness cabozantinib soft tissue sarcoma respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age soft tissue sarcoma respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . Imaging study test use study tumor start treatment . - Participants take cabozantinib tablet daily 28-day cycle treatment . The tablet take whole empty stomach . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . - Participants continue take cabozantinib long tumor become bad side effect severe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Adults With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) relatively rare heterogeneous group tumor constitute 1 % adult cancer . - The mainstay treatment advance disease palliative chemotherapy median overall survival approximately 12 month . This change considerably past year unmet need newer target therapy . - VEGF level elevate patient STS various sarcoma cell line express high level activate c-Met receptor . - We hypothesize dual target VEGF c-MET pathway cabozantinib would result clinical benefit patient soft tissue sarcoma . Objectives : Primary : - Assess response rate ( CR+PR ) cabozantinib patient soft tissue sarcoma . - Assess 6 month progression free survival ( PFS ) cabozantinib soft tissue sarcoma . Secondary : -Determine compare circulate level HGF , soluble MET ( sMET ) , VEGF-A , soluble VEGFR2 ( sVEGFR2 ) prior follow administration cabozantinib . Eligibility : - Patients must disease progression follow one line standard therapy - Age great equal 18 year . - Adequate organ function . - Patients stratify base prior VEGFR TKI therapy . Design : - All patient receive cabozantinib 60 mg PO daily 4 week cycle . - Tumor response evaluation image do every 2 cycle ( less frequently patient study one year ) . - The study conduct dual-endpoint two-stage Phase II trial target objective tumor response rate ( CR+PR ) 30 % unacceptably low rate 10 % , 6-month PFS rate 65 % unacceptably low rate 45 % ( correspond median PFS 9.6 vs. 5.2 month ) . - The trial accrue 50 patient .</detailed_description>
