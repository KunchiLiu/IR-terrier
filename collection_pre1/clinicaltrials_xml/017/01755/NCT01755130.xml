	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn image device call Laser Optoacoustic Ultrasonic Imaging System Assembly ( LOUISA-3D ) effective detect monitoring change breast tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LOUIS-3D Breast Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , LOUISA-3D scan perform within 7 day ( +/- 2 day ) mammography ultrasound scan . If routine biopsy schedule , LOUISA-3D scan perform within 7 day ( +/- 2 day ) biopsy . For LOUISA-3D procedure , lay specially-designed breast exam table place breast bowl-like imaging cup . The imaging cup fill gel help send signal image machine . The procedure produce 2 type image . For first type , image cup deliver light laser travel breast tumor . The light design detect acoustic wave produce image . Even though light contain imaging cup , wear laser safety goggles procedure . For second type image , image cup deliver ultrasound breast produce ultrasound image . During scan , image cup rotate around breast create 3-dimensional picture . The scan may repeat several time . The entire LOUISA-3D procedure take 30 minute complete . Length Study : You study LOUISA-3D imaging procedure complete . This investigational study . The LOUISA-3D device FDA approve commercially available . The use LOUISA-3D device detect monitor change breast tumor investigational . Up 96 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
