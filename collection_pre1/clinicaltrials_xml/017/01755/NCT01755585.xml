	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy ( RT ) use effective local treatment modality inhibit cell proliferation , induce cell death suppress tumor growth . To improve treatment outcome , term locoregional control survival , concurrent use chemotherapy radiation therapy ( CCRT ) standard treatment various malignancy , especially locally advanced cancer . Among drug use enhance RT effect , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) one commonly use chemotherapeutic agent CCRT . In past , RT solely use local treatment effect estimate local effect model . However , grow evidence show irradiation direct DNA damage-dependent effect well send signal neighbor cell . Recently , report abdominal irradiation could significantly modulate systemic pharmacokinetics 5-FU 0.5 Gy , off-target area clinical practice , 2 Gy , daily treatment dose target treatment experimental rat model . Additionally , result clinical investigation show colorectal cancer patient low AUC 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy lower disease-free survival . Taken together , line evidence support importance necessity search mediator responsible unexpected effect local RT systemic pharmacokinetics chemotherapeutic agent , 5-FU . In present study , investigator investigate whether phenomena mechanism RT-PK fact different anticancer drug human .</brief_summary>
