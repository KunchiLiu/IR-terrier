	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare pharmacokinetic profile two Albendazole tablet formulation manufacture different granulation process healthy Chinese adult male .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Albendazole 400 mg Tablets Chinese Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due product manufacture process change Albendazole oral formulation ethanol base granulation process aqua base granulation process , State Food Drug Administration officially request Tianjin Smith Kline French Laboratories carry Bioequivalence study demonstrate bioequivalence manufacturing process . This trial conduct support official requirement via comparison pharmacokinetic profile drug manufacture different process . After oral administration , Albendazole quickly oxidize pharmacologically active metabolite , Albendazole sulphoxide ( ABZ-SO . Due extensive metabolism limited absorption , plasma concentration ABZ oral administration find low measure . Thus , trial also compare pharmacokinetic profile ABZ-SO manufacture use different solvent .</detailed_description>
