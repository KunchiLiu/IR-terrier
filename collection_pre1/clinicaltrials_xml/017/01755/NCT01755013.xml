	<brief_summary>Successful palliation biliary obstruction main goal reduce morbidity mortality patient biliary disease biliary obstruction relate cholangiocarcinoma . Surgical intervention sale unfortunately complicate 30-day postoperative mortality rate 7 24 % . Moreover , recovery time quality life follow surgery improved minority . At present endoscopic insertion plastic metal stent method choice relieve obstructive jaundice without high morbidity mortality associate surgery . But relief unfortunately temporary since stent tend become obstructed fact effective biliary drainage proximal lesion challenge . Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) new therapeutic approach specifically target neoplastic cell . This therapy involve intravenous administration photosensitize agent follow activation agent illumination non-thermal light specific wavelength , result cell death direct cytotoxicity ischemic necrosis . A randomized control trial study Ortner et confirm significant advantage PDT regard relief jaundice , quality life , survival . In photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) uniform distribution externally apply light desirable often difficult achieve . An optical fiber tip produce cylindrical lateral light emission facilitate application laser energy direct implantation tip solid tumor . However , currently use FDA approve glass diffuser use standard care PDT might break bile duct cause injury since meant use within bile duct endoscope choledochoscope . Hence , need evaluate introduce efficient safe non-glass cylindrical optic fiber diffuser photo dynamic therapy bile duct . Recent study show Pioneer plastic optic diffuser safe effective photodynamic therapy , also use via choledochoscope . We aim add clinical evidence conduct open label observational study trial use fiber optic diffuser photo dynamic therapy bile duct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) Palliation Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) second common malignancy arise within liver , association malignant condition high morbidity mortality well recognize . It originate epithelium bile duct ductule . Two type describe : peripheral type occur parenchyma liver central type occur within related major bile duct . Surgery offer curative chance , minority patient candidate therapy initial presentation since patient find unresectable tumor . In unresectable case , median survival 6 month . Since morbidity mortality CCA occur biliary obstruction , successful palliation complication main goal patient . Surgical biliary bypass offer order prolong life relieve symptom . This intervention unfortunately complicate 30-day postoperative mortality rate 7 24 % . Moreover , quality life follow surgery improved minority time need recover surgery . Endoscopic biliary stenting endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) offer relief obstructive jaundice without high morbidity mortality associate surgery . In addition , study Luman et al even show significant improvement emotional , cognitive global health score follow stenting . But relief unfortunately temporary since stent tend become obstruct . Local therapy include iridium brachytherapy photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) may prevent postpone problem . For information PDT , please see 'Citations ' section .</detailed_description>
