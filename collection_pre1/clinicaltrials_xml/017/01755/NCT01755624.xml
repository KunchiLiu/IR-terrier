	<brief_title>Effect TTFields ( 150kHz ) Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Patients With 1-5 Brain Metastases Following Optimal Standard Local Treatment ( COMET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAST PRE CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE : The effect electric field generate NovoTTF-100A device ( TTFields , TTF ) demonstrate significant activity vitro vivo NSCLC pre-clinical model single modality treatment combination chemotherapy . TTField therapy also show inhibit metastatic spread malignant melanoma vivo experiment . In small scale pilot study , patient stage IIIB- IV NSCLC tumor progression least one line prior chemotherapy receive Pemetrexed together TTField therapy apply chest upper abdomen disease progression . Efficacy endpoints remarkably high compare historical data Pemetrexed alone . In large prospective , randomized trial , recurrent GBM . The outcome subject treat NovoTTF-100A device compare treated effective best standard care chemotherapy ( include bevacizumab ) . NovoTTF-100A subject comparable overall survival subject receive best available chemotherapy US today . Similar result show comparability NovoTTF-100A BSC chemotherapy see secondary endpoint . Recurrent GBM patient treat NovoTTF-100A device trial experience few side effect general , significantly few treatment related side effect , significantly low gastrointestinal , hematological infectious adverse event compare control . The device-related adverse event see mild moderate skin irritation beneath device electrode . Finally , quality life measure well NovoTTF-100A subject group compare subject receive effective best standard care chemotherapy . DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL : All patient include trial diagnose NSCLC , stable systemic disease 1-5 supratentorial brain metastasis amenable optimal standard local treatment ( surgical resection/stereotactic radio surgery ( SRS ) /both ) . In addition , patient must meet eligibility criterion . Eligible patient randomly assign one two group : 1 . Treatment NovoTTF-100A device together best standard care . 2 . Best standard care Patients randomize 1:1 ratio . Baseline test perform patient enrolled arm . If assign NovoTTF-100A group , patient treat continuously device disease progression brain . On arm , patient recur brain offer one follow salvage treatment ( accord local practice ) include , limited : 1 . Surgery ( repeat surgery ) 2 . SRS ( repeat SRS ) 3 . Whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) Patients Arm II may cross TTFields therapy salvage therapy investigator believe best interest patient patient agree . NovoTTF-100A treatment consist wear four electrically insulated electrode array head . Electrode array placement require shave scalp frequently treatment . After initial short visit clinic training monitoring , patient release continue treatment home maintain regular daily routine . During trial , regardless treatment group patient assign , need return every month clinic examination physician routine laboratory examination do . These routine visit continue long patient 's disease progressing brain . During monthly follow visit clinic patient examine physically neurologically . Additionally , routine blood test perform . A routine MRI head perform baseline every third month thereafter , disease progression brain . In addition neurocognitive test perform baseline every third month thereafter , disease progression brain . After follow plan , patient contact per month telephone answer basic question health status . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Electric field exert force electric charge similar way magnet exerts force metallic particle within magnetic field . These force cause movement rotation electrically charge biological building block , much like alignment metallic particle see along line force radiate outwards magnet . Electric field also cause muscle twitch strong enough may heat tissue . TTFields alternate electric field low intensity . This mean change direction repetitively many time second . Since change direction rapidly ( 150 thousand time second ) , cause muscle twitch , effect electrically activate tissue body ( brain , nerve heart ) . Since intensity TTFields body low , cause heating . The breakthrough finding make Novocure finely tune alternate field low intensity , term TTFields ( Tumor Treating Fields ) , cause significant slow growth cancer cell . Due unique geometric shape cancer cell multiply , TTFields cause building block cell move pile way cell physically explode . In addition , cancer cell also contain miniature building block act tiny motor move essential part cell place place . TTFields cause tiny motor fall apart since special type electric charge . As result two effect , cancer tumor growth slow even reverse continuous exposure TTFields . Other cell body ( normal healthy tissue ) affect much less cancer cell since multiply much slow rate . In addition TTFields direct certain part body , leave sensitive area reach . In conclusion , TTField hold promise serve brand new cancer treatment side effect promise affectivity slow reverse disease .</detailed_description>
