	<brief_summary>Gefitinib , first EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) world examine monotherapy two phase Ⅱ study call IDEAL trial . Response rate dose 250mg 500mg/day similar , range 10 % 18 % . Posterior analysis demonstrate patient EGFR mutation improve response rate ( RR ) gefitinib compare wild-type patient ( 46 % versus 10 % ) . The early trial evaluate EGFR-TKIs second- third-line setting advance NSCLC select patient basis EGFR marker . The IEESSA Survival Evaluation Lung Cancer ( ISEL ) trial evaluate role second-line gefitinib 250mg/day 1692 patient advanced NSCLC . Patients EGFR mutation higher RR patient without ( 37.5 % versus 2.6 % ) . From result , response rate patient without EGFR gene mutation obviously different ( 10 % versus 2.6 % ) . The method use detect EGFR gene mutation different , might contribute difference response rate . In IDEAL trial , EGFR gene mutation detect sequence . But ISEL trial , EGFR gene mutation detect ARMS . As know , ARMS sensitive sequence detect EGFR gene mutation . That say , IDEAL trial EGFR mutant patient misdiagnosed wild-type patient , response rate high . Recently , Wu Yi-Long et al report relative abundance EGFR mutation predict benefit form gefitinib treatment advance non small cell lung cancer . The study cohort Chinese . In study , objective response rate patient without EGFR mutation detect ARMS 16.1 % , significantly high response rate docetaxel . But 2012 American society clinical oncology ( ASCO ) annual meeting , Tailor study Italian NSCLC patient enrol demonstrated clear superiority docetaxel erlotinib second line treatment patient without EGFR mutation exon 19 21 . So wonder racial difference determinant factor . So purpose trial compare efficacy safety gefitinib docetaxel second-line therapy advance metastatic Chinese NSCLC patient wild-type EGFR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The adoption docetaxel standard second line therapy base data two phase Ⅲ trial . In first trail , docetaxel ( 75mg/m2 , every 3 week ) significantly prolonged median 1-year survival duration compare best supportive care ( median survival , 7.5 month versus 4.6 month ; P=0.010 ; 1-year survival , 37 % versus 12 % ) , although response rate low ( 5.5 % ) . In second study 6-months median survival rate similar docetaxel vinorelbine ifosfamide . However , 1-year survival rate significantly great docetaxel ifosfamide vinorelbine ( 32 % versus 19 % , P=0.025 ) . In study docetaxel significantly improve parameter quality life . Since two pivotal study , new potential second-line drug compare docetaxel standard care . With regard therapeutic result docetaxel arm study , must emphasize response rate survival data highly significantly reproducible .</detailed_description>
