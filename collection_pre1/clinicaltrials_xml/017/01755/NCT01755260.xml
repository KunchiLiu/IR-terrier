	<detailed_description>Postoperative pancreatic fistula ( POPF ) detrimental complication pancreatic surgery due potential life-threatening consequence fluid electrolyte imbalance , nutritional depletion , sepsis , local complication , abdominal abscess hemorrhage.1 Incidence rate vary considerably 0 24 % due difference definition overall rate 12.9 % recent series.1,2 Several risk factor identify , mostly soft parenchyma small main pancreatic duct diameter ; however , numerous attempt reduce fistula rate either pharmacological prophylaxis application special surgical technique fail improve postoperative outcome . The primary therapy POPF today include adequate drainage pancreatic exocrine secretion conservative treatment , consist nutritional support correction electrolyte disturbances fistula-related complication . 3-5 These recommendation base previous observation suggest 70 % case eventually resolve spontaneously.3,5,6 However , patient 's discomfort , need follow-up visit substantial cost prolong therapy initiate various attempt accelerate closure rate . Several measure propose , include fibrin glue , endoscopic intervention , use somatostatin analogue inhibit pancreatic exocrine secretion . Nevertheless , method lack convince evidence propose regimen may clinically effective.4,7,8 Nutritional support key element conservative therapy patient POPF , catabolic state attempt accelerate fistula closure usually involve prolonged fasting . However , decision total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) enteral nutrition essentially arbitrary effect diet closure rate postoperative pancreatic fistula compare randomized clinical trial.3,9 Experiments healthy individual demonstrate intravenous feed stimulate pancreatic secretion , thus reasonable solution prolong nutritional support need without increase exocrine pancreatic function.10 However , previous research suggest long-term TPN lead negative functional morphological change , within gastrointestinal mucosa also atrophy dysfunction exocrine pancreas.11 Therefore , enteral feed beyond ligament Treitz commonly prefer intravenous route due low cost potential advantage avoid infectious metabolic complication related parenteral route . This hypothesis substantiate several clinical trial demonstrate enteral nutrition via nasojejunal tube safely use patient various disorder , include acute pancreatitis postoperative pancreatic fistula . 12-15Some report suggest enteral route offer major advantage TPN term faster recovery low rate disease- nutrition-related complications.16 However , data concern chronic pancreatic condition limited.17 It well establish duodenum major site pancreatic secretion stimulation . Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) secretin release duodenum enteropancreatic reflex mediate vago-vagal cholinergic pathway responsible majority pancreatic exocrine secretion.18Without raise CCK level , enteropancreatic reflex activate corresponding increase pancreatic enzyme secretion , distention administration hyperosmolar solution duodenum . Pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) secretion also cholinergic control thus may modulator pancreatic secretion stimulate vagal cholinergic pathway.19 It also show intraileal colonic perfusion nutrient decrease pancreatic exocrine secretion , possibly mediate ileal-brake gut peptide , namely peptide YY ( PYY ) glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) . 20-22 Enteral feeding via nasojejunal feeding tube necessitate endoscopic placement could dangerous immediately operated patient gastrojejunostomy might cause tube-related discomfort patient . Anatomically , pancreaticoduodenectomy include removal duodenum proximal 10 ~ 15 cm jejunum ( Figure 1 ) . In addition , another 30~40 cm-long jejunum bring pancreatic biliary anastomosis ( figure 2 ) . Therefore , last enteral anastomosis ( gastrojejunostomy duodenojejunostomy ) make site 40~50 cm distal Treitz ligament far distal site nasojejunal tube use patient acute pancreatitis . Therefore , hypothesize oral feeding patient operate PD stimulate inhibit pancreatic secretion hasten closure pancreatic fistula . To test hypothesis , propose prospective randomize trial test effect various nutrition method heal PF PD . Patients randomize 2 group ( A B ) . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive oral feeding nutrition , TPN standard therapy POPF . The primary end point closure rate PF . Secondary end point include length cost hospital stay operation . pancreatic exocrine secretion . Nevertheless , method lack convince evidence propose regimen may clinically effective .
