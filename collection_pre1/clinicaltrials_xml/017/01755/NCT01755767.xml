	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine tivantinib ( ARQ 197 ) effective treat patient MET diagnostic-high hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) already treat another therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tivantinib Subjects With Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who Have Been Treated With One Prior Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Expression c-Met tumor correlate aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) feature . Overexpression receptor tumor sample high level blood HGF subject relate high recurrence rate surgery HCC , high c-Met expression correlate shorter survival HCC subject . In summary , c-Met hold important prognostic role natural history HCC . This Phase 3 study MET Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC subject design base result randomize , control Phase 2 study conduct ArQule , Inc. tivantinib versus placebo subject MET Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC fail one prior systemic therapy , mention . The purpose study confirm efficacy tivantinib MET Diagnostic-High HCC subject previously treat one systemic therapy , evaluate safety profile experimental drug subject population .</detailed_description>
