	<brief_summary>The aim study induce tolerance wheat wheat allergic child via oral desensitization therapy . The hypothesis oral administration wheat increase dose increase individual threshold allergic reactivity wheat protein ( i.e . desensitization ) even result reactivity ( i.e . full tolerance ) . Along , risk severe allergic reaction wheat protein minimize diet patient partly completely normalize . In addition clinical measure , immunological mechanism desensitization therapy study detail cellular molecular level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Desensitization Wheat School Aged Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective multicenter study investigate efficacy , safety immunological mechanism oral wheat desensitization therapy school-aged ( 6-16 yr age ) wheat allergic child . Wheat allergic child avoidance diet , immediate reaction recent ( less 4 month ) food challenge test wheat elevate serum wheat-specific IgE level recruit study . Patients uncontrolled asthma , lung disease , cardiovascular disease significant systemic disease patient poor compliance exclude . Well-cooked wheat spaghetti give daily patient start minimal dosage ( 0,0003 g wheat protein ) increase dose every 1-2 week dosage correspond size one meal . The initial dosage give certain defined dosage step-up carry hospital outpatient clinic . The patient parent prepared emergency treatment severe allergic reaction carry adequate medication . The daily use spaghetti continue receive maintenance dosage additional 3 month , clinical evaluation patient . Thereafter , patient allow use also wheat product . Peripheral venous blood sample take therapy 3 month 1 year follow-up visit reach maintenance dosage . The characteristic function isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) specifically test use flow cytometric method . The expression level cell-specific mRNAs ( messenger ribonucleic acid ) cytokine measure qRT-PCR ( quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction ) flow cytometry base method . In addition , specific IgE ( immunoglobulin E ) level measure serum sample frozen test . Two separate control group also recruit . The first group include patient previous food-challenge proven IgE-mediated wheat allergy spontaneous recovery current free use wheat protein diet . The second group include child ( 6-16 yr age ) come hospital minor surgical operation ( e.g . minor trauma , circumcision , patellar luxation etc. ) . Children asthma , allergy , atopic eczema , chronic disease recent infection ( le 2 week ago ) exclude group . Peripheral venous blood sample take control child . The characteristic function isolate PBMCs , expression level cell-specific mRNAs cytokine specific IgE level measure .</detailed_description>
