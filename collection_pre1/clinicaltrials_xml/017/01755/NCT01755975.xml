	<brief_summary>The treatment use treat lymphoma multiple myeloma sometimes always work well may work short period time . This new treatment test . This study test new combination two drug already approve Food Drug Administration treatment certain kind blood cancer . These drug romidepsin lenalidomide . Both drug use treat lymphoma multiple myeloma . However , drug routinely use alone , first time test together . The mechanism action drug well understood show effective lymphoma multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathology confirm lymphoma multiple myeloma Hodgkin lymphoma eligible either phase consider Bcell lymphoma phase IIa study . Phase IIa portion , subject must Bcell lymphoma , Tcell lymphoma , multiple myeloma . Relapse progression least 1 systemic therapy . Measurable disease phase IIa portion . Lymphoma ( include CTCL patient NED skin ) : CT PET/CT modify Cheson criterion incorporation PET . Multiple myeloma : .Patient must measurable disease therefore must least one follow : i. Serum Mprotein ≥0.5gm/dL ( ≥5gm/L ) ii . Urine Mprotein ≥200mg/24hr iii . Serum FLC assay : involve FLC ≥10mg/dL ( ≥100mg/L ) provide serum FLC ratio abnormal . CTCL : mSWAT &gt; 0 , absolute Sezary count ≥ 1000 cells/μL . Age ≥18 year time signing informed consent form . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Previous systemic anticancer therapy must discontinue least 3 week prior treatment study . If progression disease therapy adverse effect resolve Grade 1 baseline , case 2 week acceptable . Previous radiation , hormonal therapy , surgery must discontinue complete least 2 week prior treatment study adverse effect must resolve . Lymph node diagnostic biopsy within 2 week consider exclusionary . Short course systemic corticosteroid disease control , improvement performance status noncancer indication ( &lt; 7 day ) must discontinue least 7 day prior study treatment . Stable ongoing corticosteroid use ( ≥ 30 day ) equivalent dose 15 mg prednisone permissible . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 study entry Laboratory test result within range : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0/mm³ . Platelet count ≥ 70 K/μL , thrombocytopenia due bone marrow involvement platelet count must ≥ 50 K/μL . Renal function assess calculated creatinine clearance follow Phase Ib subject must calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50ml/min CockcroftGault formula . Phase IIa subject must calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min CockcroftGault formula . See section , `` Dosing Regimen '' , regard lenalidomide dose adjustment calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 60ml/min ≥ 30ml/min . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; 3 x ULN due hepatic involvement . AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN ; 5 x ULN due hepatic involvement . All study participant must register mandatory Revlimid REMS® program , willing able comply requirement REMS® program . Females reproductive potential must adhere scheduled pregnancy test require Revlimid REMS® program . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . See Appendix C : Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods . † A female childbearing potential sexually mature female : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Patients standard curative option lymphoid malignancy current state disease exclude . For eligibility trial , allogeneic stem cell transplantation consider standard curative option . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Pregnant female . ( Lactating female must agree breast feed take lenalidomide romidepsin ) . Known hypersensitivity thalidomide . The development erythema nodosum characterize desquamate rash take thalidomide similar drug . Prior use lenalidomide discontinue due toxicity . Prior therapy romidepsin discontinue due toxicity . Concurrent use anticancer agent treatment . Known seropositive require antiviral therapy human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Active concurrent malignancy require active therapy . Known central nervous system meningeal involvement ( absence symptom investigation central nervous system involvement require ) . Patients HTLV1 ATLL control CNS meningeal involvement may enrol discussion MSK principal investigator . The follow known cardiac abnormality : Congenital long QT syndrome . QTc interval ≥ 480 millisecond A QTc interval 480499 msec presence bundle branch block ( BBB ) pacemaker eligible phase IIa discussion MSK principal investigator Myocardial infarction within 6 month cycle one , day one ( C1D1 ) . Subjects history myocardial infarction 6 12 month prior C1D1 asymptomatic negative cardiac risk assessment ( treadmill stress test , nuclear medicine stress test , stress echocardiogram ) since event may participate . Other significant ECG abnormality include 2nd degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block type II , 3rd degree AV block . Symptomatic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , e.g. , angina Canadian Class IIIV ( see Appendix D ) . In patient doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present . An ECG record screen show evidence cardiac ischemia ( ST depression ≥2 mm , measure isoelectric line ST segment ) . If doubt , patient stress image study , abnormal , angiography define whether CAD present . Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II IV definition ( see Appendix E ) and/or ejection fraction &lt; 45 % MUGA , echocardiogram , cardiac MRI . A known history sustain ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) , ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) , Torsade de Pointes , cardiac arrest unless currently address automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( AICD ) . Hypertrophic cardiomegaly restrictive cardiomyopathy prior treatment cause . Uncontrolled hypertension , i.e. , blood pressure ( BP ) ≥170/95 ; patient history hypertension control medication must stable dose ( least one month ) meet inclusion criterion . Any cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic medication ( exclude stable dos betablockers ) Patients take drug lead significant QTc prolongation unless able switched nonQTc prolong medication without risk worsen underlying condition meet inclusion criterion : Medications That May Cause QTc Prolongation ) . Concomitant use significant CYP3A4 inhibitor unless able switched nonCYP3A4 inhibit medication without risk worsen underlying condition able meet inclusion criterion .</criteria>
