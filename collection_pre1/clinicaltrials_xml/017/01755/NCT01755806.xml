	<detailed_description>The study population comprise 104 patient refer three cardiac image center coronary multislice compute tomography , include 52 patient aortic valve calcification study group 52 subject without evidence calcification aortic valve , serve control group . Data reconstruct 10 % RR-interval cardiac cycle reconstruct image 30-35 % 70-75 % R-R interval obtain , represent systole diastole , respectively . For diastolic phase , case image 70 % acquire . Thereafter , acquire image transfer single remote workstation post-processing subsequent off-line analysis .</detailed_description>
