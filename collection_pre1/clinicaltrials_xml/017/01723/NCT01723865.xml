	<detailed_description>Aim study The purpose study evaluate clinical benefit dedicated remote monitoring system ( RPM ) management patient heart failure implant ICDs CRT-D . The clinical benefit assess : - Increased cardiovascular event ( death , myocardial infarction , hospitalization ) . - Events arrhythmia : atrial fibrillation , sustain nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation . - Autonomic profile , echocardiographic parameter , 6-minute walk test , quality life questionnaire . The primary endpoint study estimate incidence ( accuracy ) first event unplanned hospitalization cardiac reason death cardiovascular cause group monitor use RPM ( without external sensor ) group management via conventional follow-up ( Usual Care ) .</detailed_description>
