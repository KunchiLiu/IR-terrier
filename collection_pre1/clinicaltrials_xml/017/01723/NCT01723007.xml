	<brief_summary>The study design answer primary question : consumption one apple three time daily meal reduces serum level cholesterol 240 mg/dL overweight woman ? The second important hypothesis design evaluate reduction body weight intakes fruit . Therefore , increase consumption apple could displace consumption food promote satiety input significant reduction body weight compare fruit ( Pear ) similar nutritional composition food ( cooky ) make oat fiber total calorie similar observe fruit .

	<brief_title>Weight Loss Associated With Consumption Apple</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The basic proposal research study effect apple consumption dietary treatment plasma lipid weight loss . To assess effect apple add diet , first necessary standardize total number meal , since serum cholesterol level influence variation . Thus , run-in period study researcher stabilize number meal . The participant increase number meal introduction three supplement daily . A possible physiological basis hypothesis protective effect apple serum cholesterol body weight would fiber composition , study present comparison arm consumption dietary fiber adjust total calorie ( oatmeal cooky ) . However , another possible physiological factor could energy density food . Energy density important determinant energy consumption high intake diet low energy-dense food , fruit , make excessive energy consumption difficult , study conduct satiety weight control serum cholesterol . Recently ( 2012 ) discover presence apple peel substance name ursolic acid show effect reduce body weight . Previous study observe reduction cholesterol level associate consumption apple test hypothesis , well weight reduction , randomize clinical trial study three arm apple compare equal amount fiber total calorie eat oatmeal cooky fruit ( pear ) . We postulate , group receive fruit could exclude possibility effect attribute increased consumption fruit displace food apple effect . The pear chosen due percentage nutritional component similar apple . Before begin survey raise consumption apple Brazil ass feasibility study , confirm hypothesis protective effect . The apple consumption Brazil increase recent year . This trend drive increase supply fruit reduction food price general . Still pilot study survey test acceptance introduction three fruit diet participant . The majority population accept without problem ingest three fruit daily . Our initial hypothesis fruit consumption low-income population would low , confirm . To ensure increase consumption fruit , purchase delivered participant , along transportation voucher , weekly . The oat cooky also produce staff offer cost participant . The frequency number daily meal low study population baseline : 3.8 meal per day could encourage major change lipid metabolism , associated frequency meal . Then , number meal increase six meal day , include breakfast , lunch , dinner three snack meal supplement : apple , pear oat cooky . The dietary prescription base eat habit participant baseline , change number meal introduce fruit biscuit treatment .</detailed_description>
