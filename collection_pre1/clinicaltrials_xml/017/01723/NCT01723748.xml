	<brief_summary>The treatment SA still leave question unanswered . Firstly , SA treatment often result concomitant suppression insulin secretion , might lead clinically significant glucose intolerance . Secondly , traditional evaluation disease activity measure circulating level GH total IGF-I reliable enough Hypotheses : Treatment acromegaly SA versus surgery alone associate : - Glucose intolerance despite normalized insulin sensitivity - Modified peripheral GH activity peripheral target organ assess molecular endpoint</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acromegaly rare disease usually cause benign growth hormone ( GH ) produce pituitary adenoma . In case inadequate disease control , condition associate significant morbidity approximately double mortality compare background population . Medical treatment somatostatin analogue ( SA ) employ 20 year well-established treatment case surgery impossible inadequate . The treatment SA still leave question unanswered . Firstly , SA treatment often result concomitant suppression insulin secretion , might lead clinically significant glucose intolerance . Secondly , traditional evaluation disease activity measure circulating level GH total IGF-I reliable enough</detailed_description>
