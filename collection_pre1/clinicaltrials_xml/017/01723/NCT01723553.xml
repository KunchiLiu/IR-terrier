	<brief_title>Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities ( Microbleeds ) Atypical AD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) associate amyloid-related imaging abnormality ( ARIA ) . Microbleeds ( MBs ) represent part spectrum ARIA identify small hypointense lesion gradient-recalled echo ( GRE ) T2*-weighted MRI . They think represent hemosiderin deposit ( hence classify ARIA-H1 ) occur consequence leakage blood product vessel damage deposition protein β-amyloid cerebral vessel ; cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( CAA ) . However , also possible cerebrovascular disease could contribute presence MBs AD . Subjects MBs great risk bleeds could impact use anti-coagulation treatment approach . The presence CAA particularly associate AD study demonstrate MBs occur 12-33 % subject typical Alzheimer 's dementia , large proportion subject show multiple MBs . The presence MBs associate old age great degree white matter hyperintensities ( WMH ) Alzheimer 's dementia . The association MBs WMH , marker cerebrovascular disease , suggest cerebrovascular disease may also play role etiology MBs AD . However , approximately 16 % AD subject present episodic memory loss , instead display language problem poor name impaired sentence repetition , visuospatial visual perceptual deficit , refer atypical AD . Since AD associate CAA , one would assume CAA hence MBs , would also occur atypical AD , although study assess MBs atypical AD . Amyloid-binding ligands , Pittsburgh Compound B ( PiB ) , detect use PET scan develop provide invaluable biomarker infer presence β-amyloid . The presence CAA show associate elevated PiB uptake , hence assessment PiB-PET subject MBs provide important information association MBs β-amyloid deposition AD . The goal study assess association MBs demographic/clinical feature , assess association MBs imaging feature well possible correlate number MBs subject atypical AD . Patients find eligible willing enroll study ask undergo Neurologic Examination , Neuropsychometric testing , MRI scan , PiB PET scan brain . This do period two day Mayo Clinic Rochester , Minnesota .</detailed_description>
