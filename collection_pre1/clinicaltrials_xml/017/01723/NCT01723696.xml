	<detailed_description>Smoking pregnancy remain major public health problem least 12 % pregnant woman quit smoking pregnancy . This addiction large preventable cause childhood respiratory illness , include asthma , child whose mother smoke pregnancy show lifetime decrease pulmonary function . Smoking unique morbidity addictive , heavily advertised recent genome study show genotypes significantly increase likelihood unable quit . Teen pregnancy , low income , low education , live another smoker important factor increase odds smoke pregnancy . Pulmonary function test do shortly birth baby bear mother smoke pregnancy show decrease pulmonary function measure decreased respiratory flow respiratory compliance alter tidal breathing pattern . These change still measure even infant reach adulthood . Multiple epidemiologic study show decrease pulmonary function lead increase respiratory disease cost hundreds million dollar per year . The primary aim double-blind , placebo control , randomize , multi-site study demonstrate improve pulmonary function test 3 month age , infant deliver smoke mother randomize 500 mg/day supplemental vitamin C versus placebo less equal 22 week pregnancy . We recruit 278 smoking pregnant woman study . Patients meet research personnel prenatal visit smoke cessation actively encourage . Patients monitor set serial biomarkers assess smoke medication compliance , include urine cotinine level , smoking questionnaire , pill count fast plasma ascorbic acid level . Pulmonary function test do 3 month age measure force expiratory flow . The infant also follow one year age monthly validate respiratory questionnaire follow-up pulmonary function test 12 month age . Success study support strong pilot data show statistically significant improvement 48 hour age pulmonary function test infants born smoking mother receive vitamin C versus placebo , preliminary data show low incidence wheeze 12 month age infant . Key genetic polymorphism show increase sensitivity in-utero smoke exposure also measure . The success study also support animal model show effectiveness vitamin C preserve pulmonary function genetic epidemiologic study link effect smoke pregnancy oxidant mechanism . The secondary aim study include : 1 ) demonstrate decrease incidence wheeze 12 month age infant deliver smoke mother randomize 500mg/day supplemental vitamin C versus placebo pregnancy ; 2 ) demonstrate improve pulmonary function test 12 month age infant .</detailed_description>
