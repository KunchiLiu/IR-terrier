	<detailed_description>Scientific background Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) chronic mental disturbance classify anxiety disorder , cause severe social occupational damage . It characterize repetitive intrusive thought , urge perform reoccurring ritual . Illness ' course usually chronic characterize fluctuation symptom severity . Only minority patient gain full relief , even follow appropriate treatment . There two main useful treatment , behavioral therapy medicinal treatment use SSRI 's . Even though medicinal treatment improve , large amount patient irresponsive variety medicinal treatment third classified Refractory Treatment . Of gain relief , relapse rate high ( Catapano et al. , 2006 ) . Brain imaging study demonstrate neurophysiological basis OCD appear abnormal function frontal subcortical circuit illness ' symptom related increase cortical activity different area : anterior cingulate gyrus ( Saxena &amp; Rauch , 2000 ) orbitofrontal cortex , caudate nucleus , thalamus . ERP study provide number indicator cerebral abnormality OCD , critical aspect cognitive processing ( Clark et al. , 2009 ) . The sharp negative deflection associate error refer error-related negativity ( ERN ; Gehring , Coles , Meyer , &amp; Donchin , 1995 ) . Gehring et al . ( 2000 ) find OCD patient increase ERN amplitude significantly associate symptom severity . Johannes et al . ( 2001 ) use visual discrimination task also report large ERN amplitude OCD patient , whilst Hajcak Simons ( 2002 ) find increase ERN-like deflection incorrect correct trial University under- graduate high level obsessive compulsive characteristic . From cognitive behavioral perspective , obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) associate impairment stop-signal inhibition , measure motor response suppression ( Morein-Zamir , Fineberg , Robbins , &amp; Sahakian , 2010 ) . Another study relate OCD attention bias shift towards right hemifield well-established visual attention task ( Maril , Hermesh , Gross-Isseroff , &amp; Tomer , 2007 ) . Furthermore shift attention report positively correlate OCD symptom measure Y-BOCS ( e.g . less Y-BOCS score correlate less shifting attention ) . Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) associate increase rate health complaint ( Beckham et al. , 1998 ) medical morbidity ( Beckham et al. , 2003 ) health service utilization ( Calhoun , et al. , 2002 ) , mortality ( Boscarino , 2006 ) . The prevalence PTSD general population estimate 7 % 12 % ( Breslau , 2009 ) . On anatomical level report vary certain area emerge possibly implicate PTSD predisposition pathology . The hippocampus , important learn memory , show reduced volume PTSD patient ( review Nutt &amp; Malizia , 2004 ) . Two additional region implicate PTSD amygdale- involved emotional behavior , medial frontal cortex - important regulation HPA axis ( review Nutt &amp; Malizia , 2004 ) .The major shortcoming anatomical study retrospective nature , preclude possibility extract causality . Thus question temporal sequence remain resolve . Data review Etkin et al . ( 2011 ) suggest control conscious top-down regulation , like emotional conflict regulation , use ventral ACC mPFC area inhibit negative emotional processing amygdala , thus dampen task interference . The ventral ACC mPFC might thus perform generic negative emotion inhibitory function recruit region ( e.g . dorsal ACC mPFC lateral PFC ) need suppress limbic reactivity . One might speculate dysfunction circuit might contribute PTSD dysfunction regulate negative emotional conflict . Unable regulate suppress emotional arousal relate trauma relevant information , PTSD affect individual might choose avoid together . The limbic reactivity might contribute hyper vigilant response , affect memory process leading intrusion , well . In short , dysfunction ventral medial PFC structure connection might contribute symptom cluster . Summary Taken together describe neurophysiological neuropsychological finding , compel investigate antinational response inhibition mechanism OCD patient compare PTSD patient tap performance cognitive paradigm sensitive activity medial prefrontal brain structure . Study goal This study 's main goal compare OCD PTSD consider anxiety syndrome mean patient 's performance neurophysiologic response engage error detection task . Design For primary goal study , use cross section design compare PTSD sample OCD sample . Cognitive electrophysiological data clinical population compare previously collect healthy student 's data . Protocol After explanation require procedure , subject kindly ask sign inform consent version find ethic committee application form . Depicted Figure 1 , psychiatric neurocognitive assessment take clinical neurophysiology department Beer-Sheva Mental Health Institute cognitive task record electrophysiology data take place Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab Ben Gurion University Negev . Figure 1 In order evaluate error processing domain general perspective , electrophysiological research include three computerized task . In three procedure subject ask perform task , net electrode EEG acquisition place head . During task number within task break insert order reduce discomfort subject much possible . The total procedure , include task , break within task , require approximately 2 hour . Task description : 1 . The Attention network test ( Fan , McCandliss , Sommer , Raz , &amp; Posner , 2002 ) previously implement study clinical disorder ( Posner &amp; Rothbart , 2007 ) . In task subject present five horizontal arrow stimulus ask identify direction centrally present arrow press button index finger . The procedure require approximately 30 minute . 2 . In Stroop misspell word task ( Mesika &amp; Berger , preparation ) subject ask name color word present , avoid meaning . On trial , spell error insert presented word , others spell error present . This procedure require approximately 30 minute . 3 . The Arithmetic verification task modify version task Tzur colleague use previously ( Tzur , Berger , Luria , &amp; Posner , 2010 ; Tzur &amp; Berger , 2007 ) . The subject participate task present either correct ( e.g . 3X6=18 ) incorrect ( e.g . 3X6=21 ) arithmetical equation , ask decide trial whether equation present correct incorrect . This procedure require approximately 45 minute . Three week initial examination , subject invite participate follow-up session Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab Ben Gurion University Negev regardless treatment participate period . At point subject kindly ask sign new inform consent obligatory relationship participate first phase follow-up experiment . Also , subject 's treatment session determine patient attend physician without intervention research team . Patients evaluate use several widely use rating scale adminstered trained psychiatrist . Neurocognitive assessment 1 . Raven 's Progressive Matrices ( Raven , 2000 ) - measure fluid intelligence ; factor may relevant PTSD development . This also allow good control differences patient normal population . 2 . MindStreamsÂ® : neurocognitive assessment battery . Regularly use diagnostic purpose center . All cognitive assignment computerize take place Clinical Neurophysiology department Beer-Sheva Mental Health center . The patient either read instruction computer monitor train experimenter read task instruction . Electrophysiology data acquisition EEG recording take place initiation end research protocol . We use EGI Geodesic Sensor net ( 128 electrode ) system data acquisition ( Electrical Geodesics , Oregon , USA ) . All equipment material use FDA approve clinical research use routinely applied patient , child infant therefore consider safe . During procedure use equipment accord manufacturer 's instruction . Before apply net , subject 's head measure order determine appropriate net size EEG recording . Afterwards , use soft wide edge china marker , small mark drawn scalp indicate midpoint head . While measure head , electrode net dip electrolyte solution , compose purified water , salt baby shampoo . The solution warm body temperature minimize discomfort could cause wet subject 's head . During net application procedure scrap scalp require . Preparation process take 20 minute cause distress subject . Statistics Behavioral data collect reaction time ( millisecond ) accuracy ( proportion ) condition task , analyze use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) method subject analysis . Within subject analysis perform use repeat measure ANOVA variable . EEG data analyze use event relate potential ( ERP ) method , extract amplitude ( microvolt ) latency ( millisecond ) electrophysiological component . In statistical analysis ANOVA repeat measure ANOVA implement accordingly .</detailed_description>
