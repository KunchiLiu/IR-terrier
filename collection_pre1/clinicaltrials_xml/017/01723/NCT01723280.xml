	<brief_summary>Aim : investigate effect high inspiratory oxygen fraction ( FiO2 ) give laparotomy procedure occurrence subsequent , new recurrent , cancer diagnosis long-term follow-up . Background : A high inspiratory oxygen fraction ( FiO2 = 0.80 ) link prevention surgical site infection , Danish randomize clinical multicenter trial , PROXI trial , find difference frequency surgical site infection . In fact , long-term mortality significantly increase hazard ratio 1.30 patient receive 80 % oxygen , appear statistically significant patient undergo cancer surgery , non-cancer patient . At point , convince mechanism explain observe increased mortality hyperoxia , long-term pathophysiological effect oxygen fully understood . Primary hypothesis follow-up study PROXI trial : Use 80 % oxygen increase frequency patient subsequent , new recurrent , cancer .</brief_summary>
