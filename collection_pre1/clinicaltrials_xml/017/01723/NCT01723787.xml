	<brief_summary>Infantile spasm ( IIS ) , characteristic epilepsy syndrome infancy often catastrophic developmental consequence , know patient many different genetic , metabolic structural etiology . However , patient IIS present clinical feature specific cause unknown . Only two FDA approve pharmacologic treatment IIS exist , Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) vigabatrin . While vigabatrin may treatment choice Tuberous Sclerosis cause IS , ACTH treatment choice others . Unfortunately , substantial number patient may still respond ACTH priori way suggest patient may responders . This lead follow key question : Can novel genetic analysis determine know genetic cause IS great efficiency ( timely cost-effective ) ? Can novel genetic analysis determine previously unknown disease modify gene predispose individual develop IS ? Can novel genetic analysis elaborate gene gene polymorphism favor ACTH responsiveness ? Do polymorphisms suggest strategy improve ACTH responsiveness ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Aim 1 : Apply whole-exome sequence determine possible cause cryptogenic IS evaluate add whole-exome sequence standard practice determine cause IS . Sub-aim 1 : Determine effectiveness whole-exome sequence suggest disease-modifying gene may contribute triggering IS . Primary Aim 2 : Determine gene , whole-exome sequencing , may play role determine ACTH responsiveness IS . Sub-aim 2 : Correlate gene genetic factor ( haplotype ) associate ACTH responsiveness disease modification .</detailed_description>
