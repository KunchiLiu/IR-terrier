	<brief_title>Dabrafenib With Without Trametinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To screen two different regimen ( GSK2118436 [ BRAFi ] [ dabrafenib ] single agent versus combination regimen GSK2118436 [ BRAFi ] GSK1120212 [ MEKi ] [ trametinib ] ) identify regimen promise subsequent test phase III trial radioiodine refractory BRAF-mutated differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To understand duration objective response , progression-free survival overall survival treatment group . II . To assess tolerability adverse event GSK2118436 ( BRAFi ) single agent tolerability adverse event GSK2118436 ( BRAFi ) GSK1120212 ( MEKi ) combination , patient DTC . III . To evaluate impact experimental drug serum tumor marker thyroglobulin correlation overall response rate . IV . To understand pharmacokinetic , pharmacogenetics pharmacodynamics experimental drug use serial tumor biopsy , tumor block peripheral blood . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Patients disease progression may cross-over arm II . ARM II : Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID trametinib PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
