	<brief_summary>The primary goal current study evaluate effectiveness combine tele-health contingency management ( CM ) intervention investigator call Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy ( ART ) . Proposed comparative effectiveness trial two-group design 300 Veteran smoker randomize either : ABSTINENCE REINFORCEMENT THERAPY ( ART ) proactive tele-health intervention combine guideline base cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling ( TC ) , tele-medicine clinic access nicotine replacement ( NRT ) , intensive behavioral therapy mobile contingency management . TELE-HEALTH FOR SMOKING CESSATION proactive tele-health intervention provide control therapist , medication , time attention effect . The tele-health intervention provide guideline base cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation telephone counseling ( TC ) , tele-medicine clinic access NRT ART intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The addition contingency management ( CM ) exist evidenced-based tele-health smoking cessation intervention expect cost-effective way increase reach intensive smoking cessation treatment . CM intensive behavioral therapy provide positive reinforcer ( e.g. , money , voucher ) individual misuse substance contingent upon objective evidence abstinence drug use . Implementation CM limit need verify abstinence multiple time daily clinic base carbon monoxide ( CO ) monitor . As result , CM approach largely relegated inpatient day treatment program . The application emerge smart-phone technology , however , overcome barrier . Investigators develop smart-phone application allow participant video several time daily use small CO monitor transmit data secure server . This innovation make use CM outpatient smoke cessation portable feasible , i.e. , mobile CM ( mCM ) . Thus , primary goal current study evaluate effectiveness combine tele-health CM intervention investigator call Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy ( ART ) . Proposed comparative effectiveness trial two-group design 300 Veteran smoker randomize either : ABSTINENCE REINFORCEMENT THERAPY ( ART ) proactive tele-health intervention combine guideline base cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling ( TC ) , tele-medicine clinic access nicotine replacement ( NRT ) , intensive behavioral therapy mobile contingency management . TELE-HEALTH FOR SMOKING CESSATION proactive tele-health intervention provide control therapist , medication , time attention effect . The tele-health intervention provide guideline base cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation telephone counseling ( TC ) , tele-medicine clinic access NRT ART intervention . Both propose intervention design accordance national smoking cessation guideline . Tele-health smoking cessation intervention typically less intensive clinic base specialty care , increase reach service bypass barrier participation geographical distance VA care . The addition mCM evidence-based tele-health smoking intervention significantly increase intensity intervention predict increase efficacy . If cessation program significant impact ( Impact = Reach X Efficacy ) 4 change health behavior population level , investigator must identify new innovative strategy increase treatment intensity , access , participation . Specific aim : AIM 1 : Evaluate impact ART rate abstinence cigarette measure bio-verified , self-reported prolonged abstinence 3-month , 6-month , 12 month post-randomization follow-up . Hypothesis 1 : Abstinence rate significantly high among Veterans randomize ART-based intervention randomize Tele-health alone intervention ( primary end-point ; self-reported bio-verified prolonged abstinence 6-month follow-up ) AIM 2 : Evaluate relative cost-effectiveness ART intervention quality adjust life year ( QALY ) . Hypothesis 2 : ART base treatment result great cost-effectiveness compare control condition measure incremental cost-effectiveness ratio . AIM 3 : Evaluate potential treatment mediator include self-efficacy-related mechanism . Hypothesis 3 : Increased abstinence associate ART partially mediate increased self-efficacy compare contact-control condition . Supplementary AIM : To evaluate impact psychiatric ( i.e. , PTSD , depression , alcohol abuse ) pain symptoms treatment outcome across two condition .</detailed_description>
