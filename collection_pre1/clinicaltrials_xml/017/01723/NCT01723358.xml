	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) Treatment Technique Therapy Management Young Infants With Severe Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants severe neurologic disability often difficulty eat mouth due disruption swallow process . This swallow dysfunction , also know dysphagia , often evident early life severe permanent . Dysphagia lead inability take enough food maintain adequate weight result malnutrition . It also result food go lung instead stomach , result illness call aspiration pneumonia . Both complication may require feed tube either nose stomach directly stomach via abdominal wall , bypass swallow process . This process resource intense , associate number complication may result reduce quality life infant caregiver . Currently , effective treatment change natural course dysphagia context .</detailed_description>

The neurologic diagnosis base diagnosis treat physician . Infants know suspected neurodegenerative peripheral neuromuscular condition medical condition contraindication NMES treatment ( tumours neck region neck soft tissue infection ) . Children neurodegenerative disorder exclude natural history dysphagia would different static neurologic disorder .</criteria>
