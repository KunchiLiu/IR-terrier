	<brief_summary>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) become common form coronary revascularization worldwide . Although PCI safe procedure , may multiple risk include bleeding , coronary dissection , abrupt vessel closure , myocardial necrosis . It estimate approximately 25 % patient undergoing PCI significant postprocedural creatinine kinase ( CK ) /creatinine kinase myocardial band ( CK-MB ) elevation approximately 50 % patient significant post-procedural troponin elevation . Initially , felt elevation simple enzyme leak long-term implication . Now , several study demonstrate periprocedural infarction associate short- , intermediate- , long-term adverse outcome , notably mortality . Pretreatment antiplatelets aspirin clopidogrel play important role reduce cardiovascular event ( CV event ) follow PCI . Omega -3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) antiplatelet effect . It may also improve response aspirin clopidogrel low-response patient . This study randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) evaluate effect omega 3 supplement [ 400mg Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) 200mg docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) ] short-term ( within 30 day ) long-term ( one year ) major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) patient undergo elective PCI . Eighty patient plan elective PCI categorize two group . The first group receive standard regimen PCI ( aspirin , clopidogrel , heparin ) second group treat standard regimen addition 3 gram omega 3 ( 12 hour PCI ) . The main end point trial short-term ( within 30-days ) long-term ( one year ) incidence MACE ( death , myocardial infarction , unplanned revascularization ) .</brief_summary>
