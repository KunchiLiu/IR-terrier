	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose PI3K inhibitor BKM120 give together carboplatin pemetrexed disodium treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . PI3K inhibitor BKM120 pemetrexed disodium may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 , carboplatin , pemetrexed disodium together may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 , Carboplatin , Pemetrexed Disodium Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) BKM120 ( PI3K inhibitor BKM120 ) administer combination carboplatin pemetrexed ( pemetrexed disodium ) patient advance non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . II . To define dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) toxicity associate use combination BKM120 carboplatin pemetrexed . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter BKM120 , use combination carboplatin pemetrexed . II . To obtain preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity combination . III . To evaluate downstream inhibition phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) pathway . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study PI3K inhibitor BKM120 . Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute follow carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive course PI3K inhibitor BKM120 alone PI3K inhibitor BKM120 pemetrexed disodium 4-6 course carboplatin absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
