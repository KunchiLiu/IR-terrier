	<detailed_description>Despite tremendous research effort , target immune response mechanism neuronal loss associate MS fully characterize . Although substantial advance make development therapeutic treatment , drug currently available MS patient significantly alter long-term prognosis disease . Better marker represent biological activity disease process response therapy desperately need . MS think mediate autoimmunity cause demyelination transection axon throughout brain spinal cord result formation multiple scar ( sclerosis ) axon myelin sheath reduce electrical conductivity decrease CNS signal . It common young adult ; 90 % patient diagnose age 55 less 5 % age 14 . Females 2-3 time frequently affect male child affect female significantly high risk develop MS child affect male . A strong genetic component suggest co-occurrence case within family high disease prevalence ethnic population ( particularly northern European origin ) compare others ( African Asian group ) irrespective geographic location.7 The incidence MS northern Europe , genetically associate haplotype HLA DR2 common , high 1 per 750 individual . MS affect 400,000 people U.S. 2.5 million worldwide . Although numerous putative MS-specific biomarkers , represent different mechanism pathogenesis step along inflammatory cascade propose , none fully validate . To date , majority study identify biomarkers associate MS initiation progression limit investigation one several marker time ; one study attempt open platform proteomic profiling MS ; however , study size relatively small clinical homogeneity dataset study clear . To understand complex disease like MS , high throughput technology capable profile multiple etiological change need well well-define population disease .</detailed_description>
