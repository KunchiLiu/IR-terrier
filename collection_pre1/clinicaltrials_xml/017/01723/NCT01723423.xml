	<brief_title>Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium ( MROC ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite grow use breast conservation primary therapy breast cancer , mastectomy remain common treatment option . Many patient choose undergo breast reconstruction effective mean lessen adverse impact mastectomy psychosocial functioning quality life . Despite benefit , well-designed study compare current choice patient 's point view difficult ( impossible ) come . Previous research breast reconstruction outcome also fail include race ethnicity key variable . In order actively participate reconstruction decision make process , breast cancer survivor need objective , up-to-date information breast reconstruction outcomes patient 's perspective . The propose Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium ( MROC ) Study use prospective cohort design compare outcome eight commonly use option breast reconstruction : expander/implant , latissimus dorsi/implant ( LD ) , pedicle transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous ( PTRAM ) , free TRAM ( FTRAM ) , deep inferior epigastric perforator ( DIEP ) , superficial inferior epigastric artery ( SIEA ) , superior gluteal artery perforator ( SGAP ) inferior gluteal artery perforator ( IGAP ) technique . Outcomes assess include complication , postoperative pain , psychosocial well-being , physical functioning , fatigue , patient satisfaction cost . The project also evaluate effect race ethnicity reconstruction outcome . Thirteen lead center United States Canada participate . Together , institution perform 3000 breast reconstruction annually . The five year study evaluate patient preoperatively one week , three month , one year two year follow reconstruction . For data source , project rely medical billing record , well panel generic condition-specific patient-report outcome measure . The MROC Study benefit variety stakeholder healthcare marketplace : The project provide consumer , provider , payer , policy-makers reliable , up-to-date information effectiveness relative cost surgical option breast reconstruction , thereby promote evidence-based approach treatment policy decision-making . Study finding also assist health care organization design system care tailor specific need preference diverse patient population .</detailed_description>
