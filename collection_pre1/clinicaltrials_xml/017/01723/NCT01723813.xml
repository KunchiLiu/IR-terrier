	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether intravenous and/or GM-CT-01 administration correct Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes ( TIL ) anergy induce efficient long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response follow peptide vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peptide Vaccinations Plus GM-CT-01 Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human cancer express tumor antigen target cytolytic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) . These antigen consist small peptide , derive endogenous protein , present cancer cell 's surface HLA class I molecule . Such antigenic peptide , include MAGE-3.A1 NA17.A2 , test experimental therapeutic vaccine elicit CTL response cancer patient , mainly metastatic melanoma . Up , rare tumor response observe . Tumor resistance CTL kill likely explanation poor effectiveness cancer vaccine . This resistance probably acquire tumor development select repetitive challenge spontaneous anti-tumoral immune response . Recently , identify novel mechanism cause anergy tumor-associated T lymphocytes , establish new approach correct anergy vitro . Galectin-3 , secrete tumor cell , appear inhibit CTL function co-localization T cell receptor cluster differentiation 8 coreceptor . Importantly , functional defect restore anergic T cell incubate galectin-3 inhibitor disaccharide lactose N-acetyllactosamine , polysaccharide GM-CT-01 . GM-CT-01 vegetal galactomannan oligomer , currently clinical investigation several type solid malignancy capacity inhibit galectins synergize chemotherapy drug . Our observation suggest treatment cancer patient GM-CT-01 could correct TIL anergy induce efficient long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response follow peptide vaccination .</detailed_description>
