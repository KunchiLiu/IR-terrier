	<brief_title>Effects Repeated Decision Making Among Surrogates Seriously Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Just skeletal muscle fatigue repeat use , decision-making capacity fatigue repeat choice make . This phenomenon , people experience diminish concentration willpower repeat decision-making , term decision fatigue . People experience decision fatigue likely bias subsequent choice toward status quo . By choose status quo , decision-maker reserve option make alternate choice later time , thereby preserve possibility . Patients surrogates often make complex medical decision may little experience . Although clearly high risk , decision fatigue study population . To elucidate question , propose four-arm study surrogates patient population high risk make complex decision . Surrogates randomly assign varied level decision make effort ass development resultant decision fatigue whether alters subsequent decision .</detailed_description>
