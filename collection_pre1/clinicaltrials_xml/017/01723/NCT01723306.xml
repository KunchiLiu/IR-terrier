	<brief_summary>T cell penetrate virtually every biologic space power dispose normal malignant cell see viral autoimmune disease rare spontaneous remis-sions cancer . However , T cell easily tolerized self tumor antigens `` immune surveillance '' manifestly fail every cancer clinically apparent . It goal study supply specificity affinity patient T cell without regard `` endogenous '' T cell receptor repertoire , direct antibody-defined recognition kill malignant cell base expression antigen . We achieve prepare chimeric IgCD28TCR gene mammalian expression vector yield `` designer T cell '' normal patient cell . This extend approach Anderson , Rosenberg co-worker introduce augment expression gene patient ' T cell therapeutic setting . Prior study model system demonstrate recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modify T cell respond antigen target IL2 secretion , cellular proliferation , cytotoxicity , hallmark effective , self-sustaining immune response . It therefore become paramount interest extend study human system widespread clinical relevance explore clinical potential new technology . The target antigen study carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) predominantly express tumor colon rectum , breast , pancreas site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II/Pilot Study 2nd Generation Anti-CEA Designer T Cells Adenocarcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CEA perhaps prominent tumor marker among malignancy epithelial origin : colorectal carcinoma , 60-94 % tumor positive patient advanced disease ; breast carcinoma , 30-60 % metastatic case positive CEA ; cancer lung , liver , pancreas , head neck , bladder , cervix prostate 30 % CEA+ tumor . The application therapies four Phase II/Pilot clinical sub study list proceed collect patient lymphocyte leukapheresis , modify transfer chimeric gene Ig-CD28-TCRzeta . Cells selected culture amplification activation now-specific anti-tumor T cell . These infused patient , IL2 supplementation , toxicity response monitor . There four sub study embed within Phase II Study Second Generation Designer T Cells CEA-expressing Adenocarcinomas . The embedded study : - A Phase II Pilot Study Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells Gastric Cancers ( CEA-G ) - A Phase II Pilot Study Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells Colorectal Cancers ( CEA-C ) - A Phase II Pilot Study Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells Lung Cancers ( CEA-L ) - A Phase II Pilot Study Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells Solid Tumors ( CEA-S ) A total 12 subject per protocol total 48 subject enrol combine enrollment 4 CEA-expressing protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients histologically confirm diagnosis CEAexpressing adenocarcinoma . Patient may measurable tumor physical examination radiologic study , and/or evaluable disease , include bone lesion . Soluble CEA acceptable sole measure disease , although may follow addition measurable evaluable disease . Tumor must CEAexpressing demonstrate elevated serum CEA level ( &gt; 10 ng/ml ) . Preference give patient CEA &gt; 100 ng/mL increase sensitivity CEA measure tumor response . Where preserved tumor tissue available , direct immuno¬histochemical stain tumor obtain demonstrate CEA expression tumor cell . Patient must least 18 year age . Patient able understand sign inform consent . Patient life expectancy great four month . Patient fail standard potentially curative therapy . Patient performance status 0 1 ( ECOG ) . Patient adequate organ function define : ANC 1.0 , platelet 50,000 , Hgb 8.0 ; patient may transfuse achieve Hgb 8.0 satisfy enrollment criterion , otherwise indicate symptom Hgb &gt; 8.0 .
