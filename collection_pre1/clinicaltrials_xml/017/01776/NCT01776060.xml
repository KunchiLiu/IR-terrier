	<detailed_description>Unlike Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( SPMS ) patient experience remission lessening symptom , Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( PPMS ) characterize progression disability onset , , occasional minor , remission improvement . The age onset primary progressive subtype later relapsing-remitting , similar mean age progression relapsing-remitting secondary progressive - around 40 year age . Because prevalence , RRMS represent large basis basic clinical MS research . Therefore , drug primarily develop slow disease progression RRMS SPMS patient . No treatment proven successful treat primary progressive MS . The MURDOCK-MS collection represent unique opportunity carry detail biomarker research PPMS patient , knowledge investigator colleague field , would represent exceptional cohort available elsewhere US rest world . Aside first disease sampling , serial , biannual collection sample PPMS patient would permit identification 'omic profile compare contrasted RRMS patient parallel study , would also allow generation 'omic marker disease progression . This progressive etiology would provide valuable insight PPMS development may also shed light SPMS progression .</detailed_description>
