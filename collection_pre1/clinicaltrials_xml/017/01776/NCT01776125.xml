	<brief_summary>Neurofibromatosis ( NF ) common genetic disorder cause tumor grow along various type nerve , addition , affect development bone skin . It occur 1:4000 person . NF classify three distinct type : NF1 , NF2 Schwannomatosis . NF1 focus study . NF1 extremely variable disorder range extremely mild case sign disorder adulthood may multiple caf√©-au-lait spot dermal neurofibromas , severe case like disfigurement , scoliosis learning disability . Scoliosis ( abnormal curvature spine ) perhaps common bone deformity NF1 usually appear early childhood . There two type : dystrophic non-dystrophic scoliosis . Dystrophic scoliosis usually associate bone deformity see x-ray carry poor prognosis non dystrophic scoliosis . There evidence gene NF1 gene responsible variable severity case . Recent study identify genetic marker another condition call adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( scoliosis present adolescent age group know cause ) . We believe genetic marker may also present NF1 patient scoliosis . Our objective primarily determine genetic marker discover adolescent idiopathic scoliosis also present NF1 patient scoliosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Evaluation NF1 Scoliosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NF 1 patient scoliosis present either non dystrophic dystrophic scoliosis . Non dystrophic scoliosis behave evolve similarly AIS patient . Therefore , hypothesize Neurofibromatosis type 1 patient non-dystrophic scoliosis similar curve progression risk profile marker patient Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis . Dystrophic scoliosis patient curve progression risk profile AIS . The long range goal study possibly develop genetic test NF1 patient scoliosis predictive dystrophic non-dystrophic type . The short term goal study see non-dystrophic curve single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ' ) AIS SNPs prognostic . One goal study develop validate grade scheme classify dystrophic change patient NF 1 scoliosis . Radiographic characteristic dystrophic deformity describe Crawford Durrani et . al . distinguish dystrophic scoliosis non-dystrophic scoliosis . In addition , perform genetic testing patient NF 1 clinical treatment scoliosis . Although NF1 gene identify specific genetic marker identify NF1 patient scoliosis . Genetic evaluation know group NF1 patient scoliosis allow u gain insight phenotype NF1 patient would possibly develop spine deformity .</detailed_description>
