	<detailed_description>Intervention The Healthy Children , Strong Families-2 ( HCSF-2 ) intervention consist monthly mail healthy lifestyle lesson ( 13 lesson ) dose enhance social networking support ( cell-phone coaching instant text message Facebook connection ) , well new intervention elements-stress sleep . Social network chosen due widespread ease use , adaptability potential sustainability community . HCSF-2 base hypothesis work child primary caregivers/parent assist make healthy lifestyle change necessary prevent excessive weight gain risk later lifestyle relate chronic disease . Investigators work family critical time young child 's physical emotional development encourage appropriate healthy lifestyle behavior . This study expand previous research test HCSF-2 intervention large , geographically socially diverse sample AI community . The study also enhance prior methodology inclusion social networking component . This research address four key gap obesity prevention study : family preschool age child , social networking support , stress sleep . Moreover , knowledge , study first family-based obesity intervention project rural urban AI family . The potential impact study high ; successful , study provide quantitative evidence effectiveness intervention also give investigator validate tools procedure collaboratively engage AI community health behavior change . Year 1 , family randomize start HCSF-2 intervention active control ( mail child safety newsletter ) . Then , Year 2 , intervention change occur , HCSF-2 intervention family receive control safety lesson plus continued HCSF-2 social networking , control family receive full HCSF-2 intervention . For example , family randomly assign begin one two arm - denote HCSF-2 intervention ( Phase A ) Child Safety intervention ( Phase B ) . During HCSF-2 intervention ( Phase A ) family receive monthly mail information nutrition physical activity , screen time , sleep stress management . Families also invite participate private Facebook group begin receive wellness coach text message study . During Child Safety intervention ( Phase B ) family receive monthly mail information safety topic car safety , water safety , poison home safety . After one year , family flip second phase two year study period complete . Families begin Phase A continue receive wellness coach text message access private Facebook group . Families begin Phase B receive wellness coach text message access private Facebook group flip Phase A start year two . This staggered enrollment design , choose conjunction participate community , maximize contribution participate family , avoids negative attitude would occur wait-list control ensure family receive intervention desire participate tribal site . This multi-site trial six possible participate community . Two sit become active begin intervention remain site become active ( added IRB protocol ) roughly 1 year interval . A local site coordinator hire participate site . The local site coordinator responsible recruiting participant , conduct data collection visit . Site coordinator may also send wellness coach text message post content private Facebook group . The UW program coordinator responsible screening participant eligibility , administer 24-hour dietary recall phone , mail HCSF-2 curriculum material Child Safety material , manage entry storage study data , send result letter participant support community site coordinator . Methods Investigators partner 6 diverse rural urban AI community nationally conduct 2-arm staggered-enrollment randomize trial enhance version HCSF intervention ( HCSF-2 ) vs. active control ( Child Safety intervention ) 2-year design outcome measure 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . At end year 1 , control family receive HCSF-2 , HCSF-2 family receive control intervention continue HCSF-2 social network support . Communities work u enhance family-focused HCSF-2 intervention include novel method delivery ( mail lesson social networking/cell phone text coaching ) two less-studied obesity determinants—sleep stress—to increase impact sustainability . Outcomes Primary outcome body fat assess child Body Mass Index z-score ( zBMI ) adult Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . Secondary outcome include adult child waist circumference , fruit/vegetable ( FV ) add sugar intake , TV/screen time , activity , sleep , home environment change , adult psychosocial factor ( stress/depression ) social network use . Investigators also identify key mediator effect HCSF-2 obesity health behavior . We hypothesize modifiable behavior change child caregiver , adult self-efficacy , social support home environment change important mediator effect intervention obesity outcomes . Investigators develop test exploratory mixed-effects regression model investigate mediation path HCSF-2 weight reduction .</detailed_description>
