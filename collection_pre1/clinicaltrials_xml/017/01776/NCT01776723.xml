	<brief_summary>The purpose study find treat Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia ( CMML ) study drug [ ruxolitinib ] improve outcomes patient CMML . The first step study learn dose ruxolitinib tolerable ( bearable ) . It already study number patient different bone marrow diseases approve treatment disease call Myelofibrosis ; however , approve treatment CMML . It give orally ( mouth ) . Most people tolerate well tolerability determine patient CMML . We test different dos determine much medication people tolerate ( bear ) develop side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Sequential Two-Stage Dose Escalation Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Ruxolitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1/2 , two-stage , sequential cohort dose escalation study . If dose escalation complete plan , 53 subject expect enroll onto study rate approximately 3 subject every month . For Phase 2 study Simon 's optimal two-stage design employ test null hypothesis response rate ( RR ) equal 10 % versus alternative RR equal 30 % . Demographic clinical variable study patient summarize use descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation , median , inter-quartile range , range , frequency count percentage ) . Safety efficacy data analyze overall well separately dose cohort appropriate .</detailed_description>
