	<brief_summary>Hypertension endothelial dysfunction increasingly recognize key etiological factor development atherosclerosis subsequent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . A substantial body evidence indicate treat patient elevate blood pressure ( BP ) lead mark reduction risk stroke , myocardial infarction , heart failure , renal failure . There also accumulate evidence associate endothelial dysfunction , define incapacity artery vasodilate require , elevated BP increase risk CVD . While study diet affect BP healthy subject , impact dairy consumption per se endothelial function ambulatory BP well characterize patient establish essential hypertension . Therefore , general objective study investigate single-blind randomize control study impact dairy consumption ambulatory BP endothelial function subject mild moderate essential hypertension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Dairy Consumption Hypertension : Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose research undertaken single-center randomize cross-over control study . A total 80 men woman mild moderate essential hypertension otherwise healthy consume two 4-week diet , one rich dairy one without dairy , consume diet low saturate fat ( &lt; 10 % energy ) , trans fat ( &lt; 1 % energy ) cholesterol ( &lt; 200 mg/day ) . During DAIRY diet , subject ask incorporate 3 serving dairy ( milk , yogurt , cheese ) every day diet . During CONTROL arm study , participant ask consume energy equivalent replacement product . The primary analysis consist compare mean daytime ambulatory BP value endothelial function two treatment . A 2-week stabilization run-in period precede randomization participant . During run-in period , participant ask instructed adapt diet prudent dietary pattern low saturate fat ( &lt; 10 % energy ) , trans fat ( &lt; 1 % energy ) cholesterol ( &lt; 200 mg/day ) . The total amount fat diet restrict , recommendation range 25-35 % energy . However , substitution saturate unsaturated fat advocate . Sodium intake &lt; 2300 mg/d also recommend . Recommendations also include advice restrict consumption process energy dense food . This 2-week run-in period allow participant familiarize dietary recommendation use intervention per se . The two diet separate 4-week wash period also consist prudent dietary pattern recommend . It must stress food provide run-in wash-out period . These period impose minimize inter- intra-individual variability experimental phase .</detailed_description>
