	<brief_summary>The clinical primary hypothesis difference Cannabis Sativa extract placebo effect spasticity Motor Neuron Disease ( MND ) patient sign involvement upper motor neuron ( UMN ) result disable spasticity . Secondary goal study evidence improvement symptom ( particular pain ) , show favourable trend functionality measure . Finally , cannabis base drug safety tolerability study vital parameter ( include weight pulmonary function ) measurement , analyze ALS function rating scale progression slope hopefully , show slow functional value decrease , owe cannabis neuroprotective effect )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Spasticity Symptoms Cannabis Sativa Extract Motor Neuron Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CANALS project main objective analyse safety profile , tolerability efficacy Cannabis Sativa ( Sativex ) derivative patient affected spasticity due motor neuron disease . Muscular rigidity ( spasticity ) symptom affect many patient motor neuron disease , concur reduce personal autonomy , patient ' quality life potentially cause secondary symptomatology ( pain secondary muscular retraction ) . Currently available anti-spasticity drug often unsatisfactory pharmacological action cause weakness secondary effect . There many argument support use cannabinoid derivative motor neuron disease . Cannabinoids receptor express brain spinal cord . In animal model cannabinoids anti-spasticity effect . Moreover recent study ALS animal model demonstrate neuroprotective effect cannabinoids , include preservation motor ability survival increase treat animal . Recently many clinical trial ( perform Neurological Division San Raffaele Hospital ) demonstrate cannabinoid efficacy spasticity Multiple Sclerosis patient . CAnnabinois would able reduce spasticity secondary weakness effect treat patient . The result study lead drug approval certain country European Community treatment spasticity Multiple Sclerosis . The aim study analyze safety , tolerability efficacy profile Cannabis Sativa ( Sativex ) derivative patient affected spasticity due motor neuron disease ( Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Primary Lateral Sclerosis ) . The study perform along 7 week . During first week ask patient note clinical diary element related symptomatology . Afterwards patient randomize two group : drug-treated placebo treat . The study follow 6-weeks open-label phase patient receive active drug ( Phase B )</detailed_description>
