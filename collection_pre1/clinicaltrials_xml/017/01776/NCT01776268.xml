	<brief_summary>Background : Infection preterm infant common , costly , devastate problem frequently cause death sequela survivor . An immature immune system underlies frequency severity infection vulnerable population . The mouth site microbe first meet mucosal immune system . Antimicrobial protein peptide ( APPs ) saliva kill microbe improve immune cell function . Low APP level increase risk develop infection . Colostrum human milk reduce risk infection . This protective effect human milk may come supply stimulate infant production APPs . No prior investigation determine concentration APPs saliva effect human milk/formula APP concentration saliva . Objective ( ) Hypothesis ( e ) : The investigator objectives identify serially determine concentration key APPs colostrum , human milk , preterm infant saliva use highly-sensitive specific mass spectroscopy method . The investigator study design test hypothesis ( ) saliva APPs increase time , ( b ) APP concentration higher colostrum compare human milk , ( c ) APPs increase saliva infant receive colostrum orally compare . Potential Impact : If increase saliva APP level associate oral colostrum priming , discovery would advance understanding immune property human milk identify oral APPs important immune element potential therapeutic target vulnerable population . This knowledge potential alter feeding practice provide safe , low cost mean improve immune function significantly improve outcome preterm infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Colostrum Mucosal Immunity Very Low Birth Weight ( VLBWs ) Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Between 20 60 % low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant diagnose infection initial hospitalization2-9 . Infection preterm infant costly devastate problem associate high mortality debilitate survivor morbidity . High infection rate attribute suboptimal preterm neonatal immune function . In depth investigation unique property preterm neonatal immune function necessary identify novel intervention translate improve neonatal outcome . Mucosal surface critical immune barrier shield host microbial invasion surface-colonizing commensal potentially pathogenic organism . Antimicrobial protein peptide ( APPs ) mucosal surface reduce microbial burden individually synergistically direct kill microbe improve immune surveillance activation local sentinel cell . Deficiencies innate immune protein predispose host infection dysregulated inflammation . Two major class APPs ( defensins cathelicidin ) present mucosal surface adult . Colostrum human milk ( HM ) contain APPs may play adjuvant role mucosal sit include mouth . HM ingestion associate decreased risk develop sepsis necrotizing enterocolitis preterm infant . One potential mechanism behind reduction infection risk associate HM feeding may enhance immunocompetence provision APPs induction neonatal APP production . Investigators aware investigation determine neonatal salivary concentration APP effect oral priming ( OP ) colostrum concentration salivary APPs . It also unknown whether OP formula modifies salivary APPs . Objectives Hypotheses : Our objective determine : 1 ) concentration salivary APPs preterm infant baseline 7 day later , 2 ) effect oral priming ( OP ) either human milk formula salivary APP concentration , 3 ) concentration APPs colostrum compare milk . Our hypothesis : 1 ) All salivary APPs increase time preterm infant ( without OP ) 2 ) Compared formula OP OP , colostrum OP associate significantly great increase salivary LL-37 hBD2 concentration 3 ) Colostrum contain great concentration LL-37 compare human milk . Design : Following mother 's decision provide human milk formula preterm newborn , VLBW infant randomize receive OP . Investigators compare concentration salivary APPs VLBW infant receive OP VLBW infant . Saliva sample prior 5 day OP . Time-matched saliva sample obtain infant receive OP . APP concentration compare biological mother 's colostrum ( whey fat fraction ) transitional milk ( produce &gt; 7 day birth ) . To account heterogeneous VLBW population , investigator study 200 infant ( 50 infants/group , 4 group ) test hypothesis . Both inborn outborn VLBW infant eligible . Exclusion criterion include infant medical contraindication oral enteral feed , congenital anomaly chromosomal disorder . Saliva milk-based proteome include APPs determine use Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight ( MALDI-TOF ) . Potential Impact : This first study APPs saliva human neonate . If increase saliva APP level associate colostrum OP , discovery would add understand immune property human milk . Identification APPs important element improve immune function likely alter approach infant nutrition improve outcome premature infant . Ultimately , goal determine whether association APP level neonatal saliva incidence neonatal infection ( include NEC ) appropriately power clinical study base data generate proposal .</detailed_description>
