	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass clinical effectiveness long-term omalizumab therapy 240 patient treat 8 year period real-life clinical setting compare pre- post-treatment clinical characteristic identify good understand marker response omalizumab . To date , establish criterion identify 'response ' omalizumab therapy . Currently , commonly accept clinical criterion omalizumab treatment response physician 's overall assessment , GETE ( Global Evaluation Treatment Effectiveness ) . Most clinical trial evaluate efficacy omalizumab treatment 16 week treatment period lack impact long-term omalizumab therapy . Investigators propose multiple approach module well assess identify 'response ' define 'responders ' omalizumab evaluate long-term impact real-world clinical practice . Besides evaluate individual outcome variable , important attempt 'clustering variable ' investigate baseline clinical phenotype predictive good response enable u refine patient population gain benefit therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medical record 240 omalizumab-treated patient evaluate . Comprehensive data collect asthma-related event ( see evaluation criterion ) , omalizumab dose , asthma-medications , spirometry , asthma control test ( ACT ) respiratory infection and/or antibiotic use since last visit . Data analyze compare clinical phenotype outcome among patient identify , characterize define 'responders ' 'non-responders ' omalizumab . Periodic assessment demonstrate level response need continue therapy evaluate quarterly . Also , real-life patient adherence data long-term omalizumab therapy analyze factor withdrawal non-adherence identify . Reduction annualized rate asthma exacerbation , steroid burst oral steroid dosage , ER/unscheduled doctor 's visit , hospitalization improvement spirometry ACT score review asthma medication evaluate quarterly . 'Cluster analysis ' perform group variable ( age , asthma duration severity , dosage , therapy duration , sensitization profile , IgE level etc . ) effort identify group responder .</detailed_description>
