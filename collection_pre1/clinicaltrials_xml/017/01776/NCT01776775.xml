	<brief_summary>Postoperative seroma formation one common complication ventral hernia repair mesh . Although seromas may clinical impact postoperative seroma formation often cause pain discomfort may even compromise wound healing . Abdominal binder ( also call truss , girdle , ostomy belt , longuette abdominal belt ) ( AB ) commonly use abdominal plastic surgery prevent seroma formation diminish pain discomfort operation . The primary aim present study investigate effect postoperative abdominal binder laparoscopic incisional hernia repair postoperative pain , discomfort quality life . Secondary , register seroma formation . A randomized , control , investigator-blinded study supplement blinded statistical analysis . We include 60 ( 2x30 ) incisional hernia repair . Patients randomize either abdominal binder abdominal binder ( control ) . The abdominal binder worn immediately operation continuously 7 day night . All patient standardize operation standardize intra- postoperative medication regimen . Endpoints measurement clinically detectable seroma formation score seroma classification system bu√Ω S. Morales-Conde , pain score self-registrations VAS , quality life score EQ-5D , recurrence complication also register . Patients follow 90 day operation .</brief_summary>
