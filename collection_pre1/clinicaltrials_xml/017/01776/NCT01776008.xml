	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well Akt inhibitor MK-2206 ( MK-2206 ) anastrozole without goserelin acetate work treat patient stage II-III breast cancer . MK-2206 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use anastrozole goserelin acetate may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Giving MK-2206 , anastrozole , goserelin acetate together may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK-2206 Anastrozole With Without Goserelin Acetate Treating Patients With Stage II-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate neoadjuvant MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK-2206 ) combination anastrozole ( goserelin [ goserelin acetate ] add premenopausal ) woman clinical stage II III phosphatidlinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutate estrogen receptor ( ER ) +/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) - breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile neoadjuvant MK-2206 combination anastrozole ( goserelin add premenopausal ) woman clinical stage II III PIK3CA mutate ER+/HER2- breast cancer . II . To estimate rate clinical response radiologic response use World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . For pre post-menopausal woman separately , examine serum estradiol level prior pre-registration , prior registration , 2 cycle anastrozole plus MK-2206 ( cycle 3 day 1 ) pre surgery . II . To examine percent change apoptotic index 2 week combination therapy MK-2206 anastrozole ( cycle 1 day 17 ) relative apoptotic index 4 week treatment anastrozole alone ( pre MK-2206 ) . III . To examine change Ki67 level 2 week combination therapy MK-2206 anastrozole ( cycle 1 day 17 ) relative 4 week treatment anastrozole alone ( pre MK-2206 ) . IV . To estimate proportion patient whose Ki67 value 10 % 2 week combination therapy MK-2206 anastrozole ( cycle 1 day 17 ) among whose Ki67 10 % 4 week treatment anastrozole alone ( pre MK-2206 ) . V. To examine pharmacodynamic effect MK-2206 combination anastrozole ( anastrozole combination goserelin ) PI3K pathway signal use serially collect tumor specimen . VI . To explore molecular mechanism could affect tumor response combination MK-2206 anastrozole ( anastrozole combination goserelin ) PIK3CA mutant ER+ breast cancer . VII . To examine PIK3CA mutation status circulate plasma deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) prior follow therapy serially collect peripheral blood ( pre anastrozole , pre MK-2206 , cycle 1 day 17 , time surgery ) correlate tumor tissue PIK3CA status . VIII . To examine PIK3CA mutation status residual cancer collect time surgery post 4 cycle neoadjuvant MK-2206 anastrozole . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK-2206 orally ( PO ) day 2 , 9 , 16 , 23 ; anastrozole PO daily day 1-28 ; goserelin acetate subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 ( premenopausal patient ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Standard care surgery ( breast axillary lymph node surgery ) perform 1-3 week follow last dose Akt inhibitor MK-2206 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30-60 day .</detailed_description>
