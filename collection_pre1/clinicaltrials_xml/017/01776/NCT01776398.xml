	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain biologic material blood , airways and/or urine normal individual individual lung disease . The normal used establish set normal range various parameter . These provide control information compare individual various pulmonary disease , help understand etiology pathogenesis various lung disease . The underlying hypothesis pathologic morphological change airway epithelium must precede change gene expression pattern airway epithelium potentially macrophage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Airway , Blood and/or Urine Specimens From Subjects Research Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol obtain blood , urine and/or airway specimens normal individual individual lung disorder order carry laboratory study look genetic expression , gene transfer , infection , protein , human gene , store specimen future genetic study . Specimens collect may include blood , urine airway sample ( nasal , airway brush , biopsy and/or washing ) consent subject . Subjects include individual diagnose lung disease healthy control subject . The purpose study obtain biologic material blood , airways and/or urine normal individual individual lung disease . The normal used establish set normal range various parameter . These provide control information compare individual various pulmonary disease , help understand etiology pathogenesis various lung disease . The investigator use bronchoscopy ( insert scope lung ) obtain airway cell brush , biopsy and/or washing individual lung disease healthy control . By study cell , investigator hope learn specific cause lung disease , lung disease manifest progress , lung disease treat .</detailed_description>
