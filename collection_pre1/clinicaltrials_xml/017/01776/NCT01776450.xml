	<brief_title>Compassionate Use Incraft® AAA Stent Graft System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In US , abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) find 4-8 % old men 0.5-1.5 % old woman , result 30,000-40,000 elective procedure 1,400 peri-operative death . The significant complication AAA aneurysm sac rupture 15,000 patient die annually 15th lead cause death elderly 60 85 year age . In Japan , estimate approximately 14,000 endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) open surgical repair case perform year 2010 . Abdominal aortic aneurysm treat three way : ( 1 ) Medical management ; ( 2 ) Open surgical repair ; ( 3 ) Endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) . EVAR emerge alternative treatment AAA patient . It less invasive open repair carry low rate early mortality morbidity . It also extend treatment option patient undergo conventional surgical procedure due high operative risk . As EVAR technology evolves , allow treatment AAA increase complexity aortic neck access vessel . The InCraft ®AAA Stent Graft System design endovascular repair infrarenal AAAs complex aortic anatomy . This stent-graft system utilizes nitinol stent polyester graft technology ultra-low profile delivery system , assist physician deploy device control , consistent , precise manner within aortic neck iliac artery . By isolate aneurysmal sac , system provide alternative blood flow path relieve pressure arterial vessel wall minimize aneurysm growth potential aneurysm sac rupture .</detailed_description>
