	<brief_title>Effect Short-Term Intensive Insulin Sequential Exenatide Therapy Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The UK Prospective Diabetes Study show β-cell function progressively deteriorate time people type 2 diabetes mellitus , irrespective lifestyle exist pharmacological intervention . The progressive nature type 2 diabetes one major challenge treatment affect patient , agent could alter natural history condition would add greatly current treatment approach . Short-term intensive insulin therapy newly diagnose type 2 diabetes improve beta-cell function usually lead temporary remission time . The effect GLP-1 receptor agonists beta-cells stimulation glucose-dependent insulin release , follow enhancement insulin biosynthesis . It stimulate beta-cell proliferation , induction islet neogenesis , inhibition ß-cell apoptosis . Exenatide synthetic exendin-4 , GLP-1 receptor agonist . Exenatide exert direct effect β-cell , indicate may contribute delay disease progression . However , study evaluate effect short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide therapy model β-cell function glycemic remission rate newly diagnose type 2 diabetic patient . This current study thus design evaluate effect short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide therapy model β-cell function , glycemic control glycemic remission rate newly diagnose type 2 diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
