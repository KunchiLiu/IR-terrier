	<brief_summary>For AIS , care patient spinal deformity long varied history . Severe spinal deformity greatly reduce pulmonary cardiac function , may lead death cardiopulmonary failure . Therefore , surgery generally suggest curvature spine great 45-50 degree . The adverse psychological impact orthoses treatment patient poor compliance well-recognised problem . Some orthotic research study indicate early intervention spinal deformity particularly desirable . Taking consideration current clinical practice , curve le 20 degree , even child high risk progressive spinal deformity age 10-16 puberty , treatment nothing observation . This project aim combine clinical experience textile material science research develop posture correction girdle adolescent early scoliosis . As result , reduce future likelihood brace wear surgery . In study , eligible subject give tailor-made posture correction girdle wear 8 hour daily . Monitoring observation provide six month girdle period . Data collect girdle X-ray radiograph analysis , order comparison spine curvature condition . Locomotion subject without wear posture correction girdle also reference .</brief_summary>
