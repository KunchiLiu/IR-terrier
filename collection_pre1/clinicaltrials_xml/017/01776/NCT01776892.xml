	<brief_summary>Dupuytren 's disease result deformity hand lead trouble daily activity . Treatment traditionally involve cut diseased tissue , however cause damage important structure hand result large scar . Needle aponeurotomy collagenase injection newer treatment think safer . These treatment allow quick return function . One drawback Dupuytren 's deformity may return quickly diseased tissue surgically cut . This research study design compare effectiveness needle aponeurotomy collagenase injection Dupuytren 's disease . This study determine procedure give best results- either needle aponeurotomy , collagenase injection , procedures combination . Participants evaluate see long term .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collagenase Needle Aponeurotomy : Single Modality Versus Combination Treatment Dupuytren 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dupuytren 's disease benign proliferative disorder palmar fascia . It result progressive thickening contracture fibrous band volar surface palm finger result excessive myofibroblast activity . Patients develop longitudinal cord may lead progressive joint contracture . Dupuytren 's disease limit hand function diminish quality life . The commonly use technique treatment open limited fasciectomy . The cumulative complication rate range 14-67 % include nerve division ( 2-5 % ) , infection ( 4-12 % ) , neurapraxia ( 0.4-52 % ) , regional pain syndrome ( 2-13 % ) . The recurrence rate Dupuytren 's disease fasciectomy approximately 50 % 5 year . Recently , interest needle aponeurotomy collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection increase alternative treatment modality Dupuytren 's disease . Both procedure perform outpatient clinic , limited downtime , allow early return work , associate significantly fewer serious complication open fasciectomy . Needle aponeurotomy collagenase injection less invasive fasciectomy , however associate high rate disease recurrence . Numerous study investigate effectiveness safety needle aponeurotomy collagenase injection study publish . To date , publish literature use technique combination treatment Dupuytren 's disease . The investigator propose follow patient population single surgeon perform needle aponeurotomy combination collagenase injection determine effectiveness combination treatment . Patients treated combination treatment compare patient treat single modality- either needle aponeurotomy collagenase injection . Patients assess pre post operatively evaluate functional status degree joint contracture . Patient satisfaction , adverse event , recurrence , repeat treatment rate also determine .</detailed_description>
