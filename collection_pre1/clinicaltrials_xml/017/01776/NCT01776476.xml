	<brief_summary>The purpose study find give certain amino acid critically injured patient improve condition recovery , low blood sugar insulin need . Amino acid 'building block ' protein . The amino acid compound use study call alanyl-glutamine dipeptide , also know DipeptivenÂ® glutamine . Glutamine investigational , mean approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) intravenous use . However , approve many country Europe , Asia South America . Several study suggest give glutamine certain benefit patient need intensive care . In study do Emory University Medical Center use dose glutamine , number hospital infection low patient cardiac , blood vessel intestinal surgery compare similar patient receive standard feeding without glutamine . No side effect think due give glutamine small study . This study do Vanderbilt University . The investigator plan enroll 24 patient Trauma ICU next 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Glutamine Dipeptide Severe Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Double-blind , randomize control trial glutamine dipeptide give IV within first 24 hour follow severe trauma versus placebo 7 day . Primary Aim : To assess IR , patient undergo EHC study day 2 7 day discharge ICU . Secondary Aims : Near continuous data capture glycemic control via CPOE system assess surrogate measure IR . Other laboratory endpoint may serve biomarkers stress response collect daily day 7 . Patients follow mortality infectious morbidity 28 day hospital discharge . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria : To ensure injured patient cohort identify entry sufficient risk development organ dysfunction , infectious complication , death , survive ICU 5 day longer , investigator analyze patient visit VUMC identify entry criterion provide roughly 20 % mortality appropriate length stay . Enrollment criterion include : - Severe trauma ( ISS &gt; 16 ) - Mechanical ventilation - Either blood transfusion inotropic support prior enrollment . - No prior history diabetes Enrollment Goals : A total 24 subject trial Vanderbilt University Medical Center . Subject identification : All mechanically ventilate , adult patient admit directly Trauma ICU screen appropriate ISS , transfusion need , inotropic support within first 24 hrs admission . Informed consent subject enrollment : If patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion , subject 's legally authorize representative ( LAR ) approach consent trial participation . Randomization study subject : Patients randomize block receive either placebo IV glutamine dipeptide ( 1:1 ) use computerized randomization algorithm . Solutions prepare unblinded pharmacist place identical infusion bag ; study placebo solution identical appearance smell . Study Measurements : Surrogate measure IR include : mean serum glucose , insulin requirement standard glycemic control protocol , serum insulin , C-peptide , adiponectin , glutamine isoprostane level standardize individual patient nutritional provision throughout ICU stay . Biomarkers physiologic stress response recovery include TNF , IL-6 , IL-8 estradiol . Clinical Data Medical Record : Clinical data obtain course standard care . All data maintain electronic medical record electronic data repository . Discrete data point validate point entry capture prospectively . Clinical Endpoints : Patients follow 28 day hospital discharge assess patient survival infectious complication . Infections define use CDC definition . For ventilated patient , quantitative bronchoscopic alveolar lavage perform except contraindicate . Patients assess daily discharge day 28 infection survival . Daily SOFA score capture admission day 7 discharge ICU . Safety : This study approve Institutional Review Board adhere regulation protection human subject . GlnD approve Europe intravenous use extensively study critically ill population . All measurement , EHC obtain process standard care . Blood sample obtain daily less 10 mL pose minimal risk . Glycemic management provide standard care document safe effective investigator institution blood glucose obtain every 2 hour . During euglycemic , hyperinsulinemic clamp , blood glucose control alter glucose provision rather insulin rate . This allow rapid precise adjustment . Measurements obtain much frequently standard process . These method previously validate safety literature patient intensively monitor test .</detailed_description>
