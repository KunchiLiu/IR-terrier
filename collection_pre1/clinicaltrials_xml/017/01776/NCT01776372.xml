	<brief_summary>The chest cavity contain small amount fluid ( pleural effusion ) . In normal circumstance fluid kept balance . When surgery perform lung , accumulation fluid due many cause . In order drain additional amount pleural fluid , chest tube ( ) leave thoracic cage lung resection procedure . The investigator attempt reduce amount pleural fluid production formation use balance thoracic drainage system , adjust amount suction depend needs patient . That way , amount inflammation thoracic cage might small , hence less fluid form . By , investigator hop chest tube remove earlier , patient discharge faster potentially low rate re-admission hospital surgery due problem related fluid thoracic cage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Pleural Drainage Systems Reducing Pleural Effusion Formation Following Lung Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Length hospital stay lung surgery depend mainly duration chest tube drainage . Patients undergo lung resection 1 2 chest tube pleural cavity evacuate air pleural fluid . Digital drainage system ( recently approve usage Canada ) offer advantage maintain stable intrapleural pressure interactive balance depend needs patient . In contrast , traditional chest tube system offer continuous suction negative pleural pressure , regardless ongoing need patient . Therefore , usage digital drainage system ( already show beneficial reduce duration air leak lung resection compare traditional system ) may potentially reduce amount pleural drainage hence reduce duration chest tube drainage removal overall patient 's length stay hospital . The following proposal randomize , control trial patient randomize either digital drainage system ( intervention group ) non-digital drainage system , conventional system currently use drain pleural space ( control group ) major lung resection malignancy . The primary outcome study compare overall amount pleural fluid drainage major lung resection use two different chest tube drainage system . Secondary outcome include measurement time ( hour ) chest tubes remain in-situ removal follow operative procedure , overall reduction length stay ( LOS ) patient ; 90 day overall mortality morbidity ; occurrence dyspnea relate reoccurrence pleural effusion ; clinically significant reintervention need ( thoracocentesis , re-insertion chest drain ( ) number type image study require related potential re-accumulation pleural effusion ) ; readmission rate within 1 month discharge ; comparison pleural fluid/plasma protein ratio inflammatory mediator ( IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-1RA , TNF-Î± ) two group , potential indicator difference pleural inflammation permeability two group .</detailed_description>
