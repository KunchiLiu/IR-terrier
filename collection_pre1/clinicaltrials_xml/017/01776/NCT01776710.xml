	<brief_summary>A primary therapeutic goal patient intermittent claudication ( IC ) regain lose physical function exercise rehabilitation . Supervised exercise programme markedly improve walk capacity , resource intensive , National Health Service provision limit , patient cite access service barrier participation . Increasing walk activity via structured education programme might pragmatic solution improve walk capacity , health wellbeing patient IC ; however , research need substantiate . Hence , aim project develop pragmatic education programme increase walk patient collect data feasibility inform development definitive trial investigate clinical cost effectiveness . Focus group conduct inform development education programme . Programme component theoretically-underpinned evidence-based . The development programme iterative process involve pilot work , feedback , evaluation , revision . The programme assess randomise control pilot study 6-week follow-up ( n=30 ) . We assess feasibility intervention obtain preliminary data impact important outcome ( daily steps/physical activity , walk capacity , quality life , illness perception ) .</brief_summary>
