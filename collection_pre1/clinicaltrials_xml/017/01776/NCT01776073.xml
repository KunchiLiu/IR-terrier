	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure effect introduce patient navigator guide high moderate risk patient pre-waitlisting phase kidney transplant process . Patients identified high moderate risk delay waitlisting link patient navigator , facilitate completion pre-waitlisting requirement . We believe patient randomize patient navigator likely complete pre-waitlisting process complete process quickly high moderate risk patient receive additional assistance patient navigator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Patient Navigation System Reduce Time Waitlisting Potential Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan implement newly develop risk assessment tool use medical demographic indicator estimate probability waitlisting patient begin transplant process Emory Transplant Center . Medical secretary collect information patient ' medical demographic characteristic appointment schedule phone call . This information enter REDCap risk assessment tool , use calculate probability waitlisting . A previously define cut-off use categorize risk delay waitlisting . A random subset patient identify high moderate risk delay waitlisting connect patient navigator , available answer question , also manage clinical information prior , , follow transplantation . The navigator work identify potential barrier ensure up-to-date clinical information garner response nurse physician level . The effect connect high moderate risk patient patient navigator time waitlisting rate waitlisting analyze determine whether program effective mean increase access transplant patient likely face financial , racial , demographic barrier .</detailed_description>
