	<brief_title>Study Progestin Prevent Bleeding Associated With Initiation Medical Menopause With GnRH Agonist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gonadotrophin release hormone decapeptide produce hypothalamus stimulates follicle stimulate hormone lutenizing hormone secretion anterior pituitary response number endocrine feedback loop include estradiol , progesterone , inhibin . Leuprolide acetate synthetic decapeptide potent gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist use number clinical condition endometriosis , chronic pelvic pain , uterine leiomyoma , adenomyosis , central precocious puberty in-vitro fertilization . This agonist potent natural gonadotrophin release hormone peptide strong affinity receptor also longer half-life . Following administration high level gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist produce immediate increase pituitary luteinizing hormone follicle stimulate hormone secretion ( 'flare-up ' ) , lead increase serum estradiol within 2 day administration However , unlike physiological state , gonadotrophin release hormone produce pulsatile fashion , tonically elevated level gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist cause downregulation pituitary receptor desensitization pituitary gonadotrophs lead hypogonadotropic state fourth week post injection . This suppression basis clinical application drug gynecology . With initial 'flare-up ' , however , episode uterovaginal bleeding secondary endometrial impact temporary , self limit , high circulating level estradiol . appear second week . This bleed especially cause concern woman already anemic baseline . A suggested approach reduce prevent flare-related bleeding administration progestin estrogen-progestin combination preparation conjunction initiation gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy . The putative role progestin reduce responsiveness endometrium estradiol downregulating endometrial estrogen receptor . Such approach could mitigate impact estradiol flare thereby reduce volume flare-related bleeding , , potentially , eliminate altogether . However , systematic review publish literature fail identify study evaluate method design reduce bleed associate gonadrotropin-releasing hormone flare . The database search include Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews well MEDLINE use PubMed search engine . Search word phrase include : gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist , bleeding , gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist flare progestin , leuprolide acetate . The current instruction use FDA approve gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist compound leuprolide acetate recommend mandate use progestin use gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist . The standard care time , therefore , progestins estrogen-progestin compound use initiate gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy . As result seem appropriate perform structure investigation role progestin-based regimen mitigation gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist-induced flare bleeding . The propose project pilot randomize trial perform select gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist-naieve woman initiate gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy leuprolide acetate 11.25 mg determine clinician . The study group randomize one two arm : Those receive medroxyprogesterone acetate administer orally dose 20 mg twice daily first three week first leuprolide acetate injection `` control '' group , receive progestin therapy . Medroxyprogesterone acetate select FDA-approved abnormal uterine bleeding , widespread use well tolerate , multiple study describe use dosages high propose study . One study perform publish group evaluate daily dos medroxyprogesterone acetate high 60 mg treatment acute uterine bleeding nongravid patient . If investigator able demonstrate use medroxyprogesterone acetate significantly reduce eliminates volume uterine bleeding associate initiation gonadrotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy , woman KP system elsewhere may spar side effect treatment . Such finding may special value woman already anemic , consequently , unable tolerate treatment associate bleed .</detailed_description>
