	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate patient Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) also report bloat likely report clinically important gastrointestinal symptom consume fructose fructans consume glucose . We also use MRI image investigate mechanism symptom might cause . We also study parallel group age gender frequency match healthy volunteer provide descriptive statistic likely reference range healthy population . Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) common chronic condition , main feature pain abdomen , erratic bowel habit sometimes bloat . Recent research find certain carbohydrate ( sugar ) diet cause symptom discomfort , bloat wind/gas people IBS . These sugar well digest small bowel . They move colon ( large bowel ) bacteria act fermentation , produce gas . Some gas absorb breathed lung , measure . The rest release flatulence/ wind , occasionally belch . People without IBS rarely get symptom consume sugar . We want find different IBS sufferer . We study fructose fructans , sugar find fruit , vegetables wheat . Fructose draws water small bowel fructans compare effect small bowel colon . Participants attend three time , occasion consume drink contain either fructose , fructans , glucose - sugar cause symptom . Neither investigators present know drink . They record symptom next 5 hour . We observe many report clinically important increase symptom . To look happen bowel use technique call Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . We want see gas , water , build people IBS healthy volunteer . We also measure amount hydrogen release breath see could simple bedside test agree MRI finding Finding difference response participant fructose , fructans glucose could change way advise patient , could lead use MRI test IBS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE 1 . To investigate patient Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) also report bloat likely report clinically important gastrointestinal symptom follow ingestion fructose fructans compare glucose . 2 . To investigate mechanism symptom might cause . There parallel pilot study age gender frequency match healthy volunteer ( HV ) . HYPOTHESES 1 . Patients IBS report symptom ingestion either fructose fructans compare equal mass glucose . 2 . Fructans fructose cause great H2 excretion great volume gas colon ( CGV ) glucose . 3 . Fructose cause great increase small bowel fluid volume/ water content ( SBWC ) glucose fructans . 4 . Greater CGV provoke and/or intense symptom 5 . Greater SBWC provoke and/or intense symptom . Hypotheses arise pilot data healthy volunteer 1 . Fructans fructose cause great H2 excretion volume gas colon IBS patient HV . 2 . Fructose cause great increase SBWC IBS patient HV . 3 . IBS patient report symptom ingestion fructose fructans HV . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - To compare proportion patient report clinically important symptom fructose fructans proportion glucose . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - Investigate difference effect fructose , fructans glucose breath H2 excretion , SBWC , CGV . - Investigate relationship symptom H2 excretion , symptom SBWC , symptoms CGV . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE - Compare differences HV IBS patient reaction glucose , fructose fructans . TRIAL / STUDY CONFIGURATION This 3-period , 3-treatment , placebo-controlled , double-blind , cross-over trial IBS patient take 40gm glucose , fructose fructans . There parallel study age gender frequency match healthy volunteer pilot comparison data . This study consist 4 visit hospital 1.5T MRI site , Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre , University Nottingham . The first visit screen visit potential participant assess eligibility consent study . At visit give long form Information Sheet discuss ensure understanding . The visit last 1-2 hour include completion Hospital Anxiety Depression Questionnaire , Personal Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-15 ) Rome III criterion questionnaire , well brief medical history drug history . If eligible consent study , participant also give 7-day stool diary , fill week precede subsequent study day , stool collection kit order bring sample visit 2 . The remain 3 visit test visit , call study day . They last around 6 hour . They least one week apart . Participants need attend 1.5T scanner Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre , University Nottingham . On test visit participant receive ( accord randomisation sequence ) one 3 test product . Each participant need fast 8pm day study day ( visit 2 , 3 &amp; 4 ) arrival study site . They attend 1.5T MRI scanner 08:00 08:30 , give saliva sample spit straw laboratory container baseline MRI scan . After rinse his/her mouth mouth wash ( Corsodyl Daily Defence Alcohol Free Mouthwash , available supermarket pharmacy ) , give breath sample , complete symptom questionnaire , complete anxiety questionnaire - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory give second sample saliva . They give test product another MRI , breath test symptom questionnaire . Thereafter imaged range MRI sequence approximately hourly interval 5 hour . They fill symptom questionnaire give breath sample every 30 minute first 2 hour , hourly interval . After last scan , breath test symptom report , participant offer lunch free leave questionnaire complete follow day . SAMPLE SIZE AND JUSTIFICATION Sample size estimate show difference reporting symptom ( yes/no ) glucose fructose , glucose fructans exposure IBS patient . Based previous work Nelis et al . ( 1990 ) suggest 10 % patient experience clinically important symptom glucose ingestion , 40 % fructose fructans exposure . We set power 80 % significance level 5 % . No previous information available within person correlation . If consider within-person correlation 0.1 need 35 IBS patient , within-person correlation 0.2 need 31 patient , 0.4 23 patient . We plan gather complete datasets 30 IBS patient . Pilot study HV : exploratory purpose aim collect data 30 HV .</detailed_description>
