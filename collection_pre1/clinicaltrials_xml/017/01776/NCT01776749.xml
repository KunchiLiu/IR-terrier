	<brief_summary>Aim study Failed back surgery syndrome ( FBSS ) clinical entity consist chronic leg /or back pain due radicular nerve damage . The effectiveness Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) pain management patient FBSS proven . Patients mostly dominant leg pain , however significant percentage FBSS patient pronounce back pain commonly exclude SCS often inadequate relieve back leg pain component . Recently report show benefit subcutaneous stimulation ( SubQ ) low back pain patient FBSS . This confirmed feasibility study perform group . The aim randomize control study evaluate effect SubQ low back pain FBSS patient SCS give inadequate back pain relief . Hypothesis We hypothesize SubQ addition SCS FBSS patient leg low back pain effective treating low back pain ( i.e . &gt; 50 % pain reduction ) SCS alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim study FBSS clinical entity consist chronic leg /or back pain due radicular nerve damage . The effectiveness SCS pain management patient FBSS proven . Patients mostly dominant leg pain , however significant percentage FBSS patient pronounce back pain commonly exclude SCS often inadequate relieve back leg pain component . Recently report show benefit subcutaneous stimulation ( SubQ ) low back pain patient FBSS . This confirmed feasibility study perform group . The aim randomize control study evaluate effect SubQ low back pain FBSS patient SCS give inadequate back pain relief . Hypothesis We hypothesize SubQ addition SCS FBSS patient leg low back pain effective treating low back pain ( i.e . &gt; 50 % pain reduction ) SCS alone . Study design duration study The study randomize control trial . Patients FBSS additional chronic back pain intensity 5 leg back pain separately visual analogue scale eligible study . About ninety patient receive SCS system target relief leg back pain . The study group consist patient pain reduction ≥50 % leg SCS trial stimulation . If , trial stimulation , le 50 % back pain relief compare initial value , patient receive one two Quad lead subcutaneously time implantation pulse generator . This group , total 56 patient , randomize 1:1 ratio group 1 ( n=28 ) receive SCS plus non-activated SubQ ( SubQ OFF ) group 2 ( n=28 ) receive SCS plus activate SubQ ( SubQ ON ) ( phase 1 ) , period 3 month . After controlled phase study , 56 patient receive maximal effective SCS SubQ rest study duration ( phase 2 ) . Total duration study patient is12 month . Estimated duration study 18 month . Comparisons make 3 month SubQ OFF SubQ ON . After 6 12 month ( phase 2 ) patient compare baseline value explore long term effect SCS SubQ . Type number patient The study include FBSS patient leg low back pain , fail relief back pain SCS . For controlled part study 56 patient need base power calculation difference two treatment postulate 40 % . To assure 90 patient include study .
