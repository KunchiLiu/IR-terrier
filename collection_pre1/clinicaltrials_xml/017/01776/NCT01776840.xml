	<brief_title>A Study Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib Given Combination With Bendamustine Rituximab Patients With Newly Diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( individual assign study treatment chance ) , double blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo ( inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) -controlled study compare efficacy safety ibrutinib give combination bendamustine rituximab ( BR ) BR alone participants newly diagnose mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) 65 year age old . Approximately 520 participant randomly assign 1:1 ratio stratify simplified Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index ( MIPI ) score ( low risk [ 0-3 ] versus intermediate risk [ 4-5 ] versus high risk [ 6-11 ] ) . The treatment phase extend randomization discontinuation study treatment clinical cutoff end study . A cycle define 28 day . All participant receive open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) BR background therapy maximum 6 cycle ; participant complete response partial response continue receive open-label background therapy rituximab maintenance every second cycle maximum 12 additional dos . In addition background therapy , participant receive blind study drug ( ibrutinib placebo ) . Participants randomize treatment Arm A receive placebo capsule participant randomize treatment Arm B receive ibrutinib capsule . Study drug administer daily continuously disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study end . Participants stable disease initial chemoimmunotherapy ( BR+ibrutinib/placebo ) continue treatment ibrutinib/placebo disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study end . Participants progressive disease must discontinue study treatment . For participant discontinue background therapy progressive disease , treatment study drug continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity clinical cutoff final analysis progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Participants receive BR , rituximab , ibrutinib clinical cutoff final analysis PFS continue open-label treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Placebo stop study unblinded clinical cutoff final analysis PFS . The posttreatment follow-up phase begin participant discontinues bendamustine rituximab study drug . Participants discontinue reason disease progression must continue disease evaluation outline protocol . Participants discontinue due disease progression follow survival subsequent anti-MCL therapy . The posttreatment follow-up phase continue death , lose follow , consent withdrawal , study end , whichever occur first . Four clinical cutoff plan . The first 3 clinical cutoff occur approximately 134 , 180 , 265 PFS event observe , respectively . The interim analyse final analysis PFS take place 3 clinical cutoff , respectively ; participant treatment assignment unblinded clinical cutoff final analysis PFS . The last cutoff occur end study , 60 % randomized participant die Sponsor terminates study , whichever come first . Efficacy assessment conduct accordance Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma . Safety monitor throughout study summarize . Blood sample draw assessment pharmacokinetic parameter . Blood bone marrow collect assessment minimal residual disease biomarker study .</detailed_description>
