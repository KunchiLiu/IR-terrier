	<brief_summary>In PINOCCHIO-Triayl , carbon ion radiotherapy compare proton advance photon radiotherapy patient skull base meningioma . There two treatment arm photon , one arm hypofractionated photon radiotherapy , one arm conventional fractionation . The study design descriptive study feasibility investigate therapy aim comparison toxicity . The study serve basis large randomize protocol compare efficacy therapy , assume toxicity comparable four treatment arm . Primary endpoint toxicity , secondary endpoint overall survival , progression-free survival quality life .</brief_summary>
