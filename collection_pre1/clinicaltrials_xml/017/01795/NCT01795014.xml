	<brief_summary>A spontaneous venous pulsation optic disc ophthalmological sign potentially find 98 % healthy individual . In fact , lack spontaneous retinal venous pulse consistently implicate indicator advanced form certain ocular disease , specifically open-angle glaucoma . However , mechanism behind change retinal venous system clear . Some evidence suggest extraocular feature intracranial pressure ( ICP ) may play role regulate intraocular venous outflow . The reason hypothetical downstream resistance venous outflow fully understood , advance field limit technological-imposed difficulty assess structure behind globe . However , establish volume cerebrospinal fluid surround optic nerve correlate ICP orbital level . Recent study suggest non-invasive ultrasound-based recording correlate surrogate orbital ICP intraocular pressure ( IOP ) glaucoma patient otherwise normal IOP range ( normal tension glaucoma - NTG ) . The investigator therefore conduct test determine cerebrospinal volume surround optic nerve correlate frequency observation otherwise signal venous dysfunction ( i.e . lack visible pulse retinal central vein ) Additionally , investigator assess correlation different healthy individual , hypertensive primary-open angle glaucoma NTG patient .</brief_summary>
