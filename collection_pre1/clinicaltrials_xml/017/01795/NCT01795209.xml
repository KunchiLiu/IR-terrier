	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Macular Edema Secondary Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion Patients With Fair Vision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lucentis approve ME due BRVO base result BRAVO study . The inclusion criterion BRAVO `` best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) 20/40 20/320 '' . Therefore , patient VA well 20/40 inclusion criterion BRAVO study treatment wait reach spontaneous improvement . But , unmet need patient , actual clinical practice , many retina specialist treat patient Ranibizumab . These patient experience VA improvement injection . Based clinical background , investigator want suggest treatment guideline patient group , , early treatment ranibizumab would effective increase patient ' QOL . In word , many experience case among ophthalmologist , clinical trial endorse treatment . To confirm efficacy ranibizumab patient initial fair vision , investigator start prospective randomize clinical trial efficacy safety ranibizumab patient .</detailed_description>
