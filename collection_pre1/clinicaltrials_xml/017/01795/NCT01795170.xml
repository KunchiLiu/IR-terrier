	<detailed_description>I Purpose : The purpose multi-centre study ass safety efficacy propose lysine restrict diet confirm ATQ deficient PDE patient . II Hypothesis : Restricting dietary lysine intake infant age 3 month less confirmed diagnosis pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy due Antiquitin ( ATQ ) deficiency : reduce accumulation neurotoxic substratesα-aminoadipicsemialdehydeandits cyclic equivalent 1-piperideine-6-carboxylate ; improve overall neurodevelopmental outcome 3 year age act effective intervention complex pathophysiology condition . III Justification : We hope participant much improve chance avoid degree developmental delay associate problem . If study demonstrate significant improvement normal development prof safe use would provide positive benefit child , family involve well decrease burden health care system currently must provide life long care affected child . IV Objectives : To determine safety efficacy lysine restrict diet numerous primary secondary outcome measure list protocol . The primary objective study evaluate neurodevelopmental outcome base neuropsychological assessment use Bayley-III . V Research Method : 1 . Recruitement - Infants and/or child range less 3 month 3 year age diagnose PDE confirm ATQ deficiency recruit within 3 participate TIDE clinic ( Medical Genetics , Biochemical Diseases , Neurology ) . Families may choose participate TEST group CONTROL group wish undergo lysine restrict diet regimen decline participate altogether . 2 . Study visit - For participant TEST group , include baseline visit follow visit age 3 month , 6 month every 6 month 3 year age . For participant CONTROL group study visit include baseline visit 1 follow visit age 3 year . Routine clinical care visit schedule per treat physician 's discretion shorter interval need . 3 . Procedures : The follow safety efficacy measure perform specify study visit ( Refer table1 protocol consent ) : medical history , vital sign , anthropometric measurement , Physical Neurological exam , vision &amp; hearing assessment , blood urine sample test biomarkers , electroencephalogram , cognitive function test , age stage questionnaire , quality life questionnaire , MRI , Cerebral Spinal fluid request lumbar puncture perform clinical purpose . 4 . Study Outcomes : The follow outcome measure . Efficacy : Primary Outcomes - Neurocognitive development age 3 year define total developmental index measure use Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development , 3rd Edition ( Bayley-III ) - Level biochemical marker-α- aminoadipic semialdehyde ( AASA ) cyclic equivalent P6C plasma urine Secondary Outcomes - Seizure frequency : clinical electrical ( EEG ) - Quality life HR-QOL questionnaire - Neurological deficit neuro exam Safety : Primary Outcomes - Anthropometric measure - Plasma lysine branch chain amino acid level Secondary Outcomes - Global nutritional assessment plasma level albumin , prealbumin , total protein , iron parameter , zinc , selenium , CBC , folic acid , vitamin B12 - Peripheral sensory neuropathy ( relevant lysine restriction expect reduce chemical inactivation pyridoxine , thus potentially increase risk toxicity ) VI Statistical Analysis : I . OVERALL STUDY DESIGN Structure : We conduct multicenter , open label , negative-controlled observational cohort study assess safety efficacy neurodevelopmental outcome early dietary lysine restriction adjunct pyridoxine therapy infant pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy result ATQ deficiency . Treatment Exposure : Patients receive lysine restrict diet adjunct pyridoxine therapy consider participant 'exposure'/test group patient pyridoxine mono-therapy participant 'control ' group . The ratio test participant control study 1:2 . Duration : All participant monitor safety neurodevelopmental outcome age 3 year . Efficacy &amp; Safety Analysis : Data summarize descriptive statistic , frequency tabulation , data listing . Analyses include comparison treatment effect diet restriction within participant , comparison test control group . Analysis perform intent-to-treat population include enrolled participant . The primary objective study evaluate neurodevelopmental outcome base neuropsychological assessment use Bayley-III . The evaluation comprise follow scale : Cognitive Scale , Language Composite Scale Receptive Expressive Language subscales , Motor Composite Scale Fine- Gross-Motor subscales . A composite score scale give total developmental index . For composite score scale , hypothesis test perform compare test group control group . A 2-sided 95 % confidence interval mean change Treatment minus mean change control group calculate total developmental index individual scale Bayley-III evaluate particular nonnegative quantity clinical interest . Similar analysis use appropriate parametric ( ANOVA , ANCOVA , Fishers exact test ) nonparametric test ( Wilcoxon rank sum test ) do efficacy safety outcome . Severity relationship treatment adverse event summarize .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis pyridoxinedependent epilepsy base clinical symptom elevate level plasma urine AASA . Confirmation least one know disease cause mutation ALDH7A1 gene obtain within one month enrollment . Participant male female &lt; 3 year age . Participants test arm le 3 month age dietary restriction start . Participants control arm may older 3 month age must older 3 year age enrol study must pyridoxine treatment prior age 3 month treat dietary lysine restriction time life . Participant manage vitamin B6 dose 1530 mg/kg/day continuously begin &lt; 3 month age , willing maintain dose study duration . Participants must offer dietary lysine restriction adjunct therapy part standard clinical care . Parent ( ) guardian ( ) willing able provide write informed consent nature study explain , prior researchrelated procedure . Diagnosis confirm : Participant mutation ALDH7A1 gene . Participant treat prenatally PDE pyridoxine ( i.e . mother pyridoxine ) Timing dietary restriction : Participant lysinerestricted diet age &gt; 3months . Confounding factor : Participant preterm gestational age &lt; 32 week The participant birth weight less 2nd percentile weighs le 2nd percentile study entrance ( age appropriate growth chart ) . Participant show intracranial malformation abnormality unrelated ATQ deficiency , diagnose cranial ultrasound and/or MRI brain scan Participant disorder identify affect cognitive function opinion coordinate principal investigator . A known allergy sensitivity component product commonly use lysinerestricted diet product associate lysine restriction product associate general study procedure . Participant oral folinic acid and/or pyridoxal phosphate treatment study entrance . Participant condition situation , investigator 's opinion , place patient significant risk adverse event , may interfere significantly participation compliance study .</criteria>
