	<brief_summary>The physical biological property carbon ion beam promise improve therapeutic ratio patient pancreatic cancer : Due invert dose profile dose deposition entry channel beam lead spar normal tissue ; Bragg peak direct defined target volume , sharp dose fall-off thereafter spare normal tissue behind target volume . The high RBE carbon ion , show also pancreatic cancer cell line preclinical setting , likely contribute increase local control , perhaps OS . Early data Japanese center show convincing result . The PHOENIX-01 trial first trial evaluate actively deliver carbon ion beam patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer within dose-escalation strategy .</brief_summary>
