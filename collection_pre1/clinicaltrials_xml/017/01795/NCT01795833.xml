	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes major healthcare problem develop develop world . Recent clinical trial demonstrate may prevent lifestyle intervention focus diet physical activity . These trial expensive labour intensive limited translation know benefit population large . We propose use mobile phone intervention lifestyle change assess clinical trial ( study ) people impair glucose regulation ( high risk develop type 2 diabetes ) . The study conduct India UK . The purpose study assess effectiveness acceptability text message system prevent progression diabetes people high risk . The study involve five visit clinic 2 year period . Study participant divide two group computer generate random method - one 'Usual Care ' group 'Text Messaging ' group . - Usual care consist 30 minute interview , deliver personalize diet exercise advice , supplement write material education regard diabetes . This deliver begin study . - The intervention group undergo initial interview , addition , receive 3 time weekly text message education , advice , support motivation . These message personalize individual target set initial interview . The primary outcome progression diabetes , without SMS intervention . Secondary outcome improvement physical activity ( report directly measure ) , body weight cardiovascular risk factor ( blood pressure , total HDL cholesterol serum triglyceride ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment : - Target recruitment number 1834 total ( 1134 India 700 UK ) . - In India people risk ascertain use Indian Diabetes Risk Score follow measurement single blood sample ass glucose regulation ( HbA1c ) high score . - In UK , high risk subject ascertain National Health service ( NHS ) Health Check Scheme routine screening primary care; UK recruitment also base HbA1c . Trial Design : 1 . Visit 1 ( Screening ) - Potential subject invite clinic screening determine prediabetic state ( defined HbA1c 6.0-6.4 % ) suitability take part study . - Screening involve clinical measurement , physical measurement laboratory measurement . Also , baseline questionnaire carry visit . - ActiGraph , physical activity monitoring device fit keep 7 day . 2 . Visit 2 ( Education Randomization ) - One-to-One structured education healthy lifestyle give successfully screened subject . - The subject randomize use computer generate number either usual care ( control arm ) usual care text messaging ( intervention arm ) . 3 . Visit 3 ( 6 month follow ) , Visit 4 ( 12 month follow-up ) Visit 5 ( 24 month follow-up ) - visit involve - clinical measurement , physical measurement laboratory measurement - Questionnaires - Fitting ActiGraph subject Efficacy : - The primary outcome progression type 2 diabetes - Secondary outcome : - Change physical activity measure Actigraph Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire ( RPAQ ) - Change weight , BMI , waist circumference , hip circumference waist : hip ratio - Change fast plasma glucose HbA1c - Change lipid profile - Liver function measure alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) gamma-glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) - Change diet assess validate food frequency questionnaire - Quality life assess EQ-5D questionnaire - Cardiovascular biomarkers include hsCRP , adiponectin , PAI ( plasminogen activator inhibitor ) , uric acid , white cell count , albumin , IL-6 , IL-1 , TNF-α , monocytes chemotactic protein-1 , leptin , resistin , endothelin-1 , E-selectin , soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 ( sVCAM-1 ) soluble interstitial cellular adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) - Insulin secretion sensitivity calculate fast plasma glucose insulin measurement Data : - During course study visit data store laptop computer , connect internet , later statistical analysis . These data cod non identifiable . - Participant data store locked filing cabinet secure room Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust . Only research team ( clinical research fellow research nurse ) access file cabinet . - At end visit anonymised data transfer immediately secure NHS computer delete laptop . Access NHS computer member NHS staff appropriate log privilege . - All data store anonymised form use study number identification participant . - The NHS code confidentiality follow activity meet requirement data protection act . - Only member clinical research team responsible direct care access subject ' data study . - The data generate study analyze research team Imperial College . The analysis anonymised data take place Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Imperial College academic building Faculty Medicine . Direct Access Source Data/Documents : *The investigator ( ) /institution ( ) permit trial-related monitoring , audit , regulatory inspection ( ) , provide direct access source data/documents . Statistics : - Sample size base previous data Indian Diabetes Prevention study . We estimate two year conversion rate diabetes control group 25 % . A total 1134 individual per group require across country detect 20 % reduction risk progression 80 % power 5 % significance . A study size able address question whether , overall , text messaging system effective reduce progression diabetes high risk individual . It sufficiently power address question country separately , detect difference effect . However , study size extremely well powered detect impact continuously distribute secondary outcome moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) assess Actigraph . The standard deviation MVPA ProActive trial 17 minute per day . Thus study overall &gt; 99 % power detect difference 4 minute per day extra walk group . It possible , therefore , examine country specific effect intervention MVPA - Missing , unused , spurious data assess individual basis may ignore , withdrawn visit may remove analysis appropriate justification adjudicate Principal Investigator . - Data analyze use parametric nonparametric statistical method primary secondary outcome . Regulatory Issues : - Ethics Approval The Chief Investigator obtain approval Westminster Research Ethics Committee . Local Research Development ( R &amp; D ) Approval participate NHS Trust also require accept participant study . The study conduct accordance recommendation physicians involve research human subject adopt 18th World Medical Assembly , Helsinki 1964 late revision . - Consent enter study must seek participant full explanation give , information leaflet offer time allow consideration . Signed participant consent obtain . The right participant refuse participate without give reason must respect . All participant free withdraw time protocol treatment without give reason without prejudice treatment . - The Chief Investigator preserve confidentiality participant take part study register Data Protection Act . - Indemnity Imperial College London hold negligent harm non-negligent harm insurance policy apply study . - Imperial College Academic Health Science Centre act main Sponsor study . Delegated responsibility assign NHS trust take part study . - The study may subject inspection audit Imperial College London remit sponsor regulatory body ensure adherence GCP NHS Research Governance Framework Health Social Care ( 2nd edition ) .</detailed_description>
