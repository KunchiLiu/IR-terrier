	<brief_summary>Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Type I ( CDAI ) recessive autosomal disease cause ineffective erythropoiesis cause Anemia &amp; accumulation iron due increase absorption iron intestine . The iron accumulate body &amp; cause damage liver , heart &amp; endocrine gland . The standard follow iron level do ferritin blood test &amp; although test accurate available . Medical treatment removal iron excess body give ferritin level 500-1000 . 3 drug approve market : - Deferoxamine , give subcutaneous night , 5-7 nights/week therefore less use today . - Deferiprone-given 3 time day , weak chelator , although seem like good give combination one 2 drug remove iron heart 's cell well . A rare severe adverse effect Agranulocytosis . This drug usually give childbirth . -The 3rd drug mostly use today Deferasirox , give daily , also adverse effect , among them- damage liver &amp; kidney function , damage digestive system , hear see . Iron absorb acidic area , &amp; thus drug decrease acidity like hydrogen pump 's inhibitor , inhibit absorption iron , indeed report drug decrease absorption iron use treatment hemochromatosis well . Those hydrogen pump 's inhibitor also adverse effect . The rare severe intestine infection Clostridium . In child , report adverse effect minimal- mostly headaches &amp; abdominal pain nosocomial infection . In adult , report fracture , magnesium deficiency &amp; vitamin B12 deficiency . All , adverse effect rare &amp; uncommon .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Decreasing Iron Absorption Patients With Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Type I Treatment With LOSEC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study check whether treatment drug inhibits hydrogen pump therefore decrease acidity , reduce iron 's absorption patient CDA TYPE I whether possible use period instead give drug much adverse effect , removal iron excess body . Therefore , would like enroll 10-12 patient 30 kg swallow tablet ( age 12 ) whose ferritin level higher normal range , still n't require medical treatment ( ferritin level 400-700 ) . These patient give LOSEC 20 mg X 1/day 6 month . That group control group 6 month later . Drug dispense patient . In begin study , sign Informed Consent Form , blood test take Complete Blood Count , iron level , iron saturation , ferritin , complete chemistry panel , include calcium &amp; magnesium . Same test take 3 6 month also 3 6 month end treatment . In every event fever , headache , abdominal pain diarrhea , patient need apply doctor report .</detailed_description>
