	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study PD-616 Plus Cytarabine Treat Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol RT12-US-AML-a 2-part , Phase 1/2 , multi-center , open-label , dose-escalation study PD-616 combination low-dose cytarabine patient AML high-risk MDS eligible standard therapy . Part 1 study ( Phase 1 portion ) employ sequential group-dose escalation design determine DLT MTD PD-616 combination low-dose cytarabine ( primary objective ) . The safety PK profile well preliminary efficacy PD-616 combination cytarabine also examine ( secondary objective ) . Approximately 21 patient plan enrol Part 1 . After provision write informed consent , patient evaluate study eligibility Screening period within 14 day first day study drug administration ( Cycle 1 , Day 1 [ C1D1 ] ; Baseline ) . Patients determine eligible , base Screening assessment , enrol study C1D1 , first day study drug administration . Part 2 study ( Phase 2 portion ) commence approval Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) identification MTD , MTD establish , maximum feasible dose evaluate Part 1 . Twelve additional patient enrol treated PD-616 MTD ( biologically relevant dose ) combination low-dose cytarabine accord schedule Part 1 . The safety profile , PK , efficacy study drug combination investigate Part 2 study . Each cycle treatment consist treatment period ( D1 D12 ) rest period ( D13 D28 ) . During treatment period , patient require return study center D1 D5 D8 D12 study drug administer evaluation perform . During rest period , patient require return study center least week study evaluation . In addition , patient require evaluated peripheral blast flow cytometry last week cycle ( D22 D28 ) receive bone marrow examination last week ( D22 D28 ) C1 . Patients evidence complete response ( CR ) peripheral blood flow cytometry repeat bone marrow examination perform confirm CR . All patient attend Study Drug Discontinuation Visit within 3 day discontinue study drug . Thereafter , patient enter post-study period follow monthly ( ±3 day ) , start 30±3 day last study drug administration , 1 year post-C1D1 . During post-study period , patient discontinue reason progressive disease ( PD ) also follow-up blood sample collect evaluation change percentage blast every month PD receipt alternative therapy , whichever occur first , 1 year post-C1D1 . During post-study period , patient evidence CR peripheral blood flow cytometry repeat bone marrow examination perform confirm CR .</detailed_description>
