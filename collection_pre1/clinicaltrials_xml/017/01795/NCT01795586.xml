	<brief_summary>This study do see safe combination eribulin carboplatin work help people advance breast cancer . Eribulin carboplatin chemotherapy drug . They work kill cancer cell . A person make cell control every function body . Some cell stop work like become cancer cell . These cancer cell grow multiply rapidly cause destruction normal body organ . Eribulin carboplatin approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use treatment breast cancer . The combination two drug safest dose eribulin use experimental .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer metastatic disease locally advance unresectable , standard curative measure longer effective . Must receive 3 prior cytotoxic therapy metastatic setting . If patient demonstrate positive Her2/Neu disease must progress Herceptin . Once maximum tolerate dose establish ; 10 patient treat dose must receive 2 prior cytotoxic therapy metastatic setting . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/µL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/µL platelets ≥100,000/µL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit aspartic transaminase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Must measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) one exception . However , may bone disease xray modality show least 1 cm tumor . Female patient childbearing potential negative serum pregnancy test beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) agree use effective contraception study . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . If patient residual toxicity prior therapy ≤ grade 1 . Patients currently participate participate study investigational compound device within 30 day Day 1 study Patient know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases carcinomatous meningitis . Patients complete course therapy would eligible study stable 2 month prior entry evidence new enlarge CNS metastasis chronic steroid . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition eribulin mesylate carboplatin Patients Class Ia III antiarrhythmic . The principal investigator ( PI ) and/or treat physician evaluate medication make sure none would significantly interfere correct QT interval ( QTc ) . Patient known history Hepatitis B C active Hepatitis A HIV Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . This include symptomatic pleural effusion ascites . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother eribulin carboplatin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated eribulin carboplatin .
