	<brief_summary>The incidence allergic rhinitis asthma increase throughout world well country . Allergen-specific immunotherapy use almost 100 year . Since , recommend management Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) -mediated allergic disease immune modulator therapeutic tool . It well document allergen immunotherapy perform use single allergen efficacious monosensitized patient . Hence , polysensitization much prevalent monosensitization patient respiratory allergy . On hand , polysensitization may paramount relevance clinical practice ; example , many allergist doubt choose allergen extract allergen specific immunotherapy . In regard , evaluation immunotherapy efficacy polysensitized patient still represent unanswered question study issue . However , clinical trial allergen immunotherapy perform multiple different allergen extract use sublingual route . To best knowledge , common single-allergen ( house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus , Der p ) subcutaneous immunotherapy trial specifically design compare efficacy monosensitized polysensitized patient . Furthermore , study demonstrate monosensitized polysensitized patient appear differ term immune reactivity . But , unknown whether single-allergen immunotherapy protocol elicit distinct immune response monosensitized polysensitized patient . The aim study investigate immunological change clinical effectiveness relevant single-allergen immunotherapy patient allergic rhinitis and/or asthma . The study population include 40 adult patient moderate/severe perennial allergic rhinitis mild/moderate asthma monosensitized house dust mite sensitize least 2 different allergen include house dust mite . No patient previously perform allergen immunotherapy . The study plan prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled . Both group first receive placebo injection 3 month , follow cluster immunotherapy schedule . After maintenance dose reach within 6 week , injection receive monthly interval . Standardized depot preparation Der p extract ( Alutard Standard Quality SQ , ALK-Abello ( Company Name ) , Madrid , Spain ) administer mean subcutaneous injection . All eligible patient underwent 8 week run-in period evaluate baseline clinical status base history allergy , symptom medication usage rhinitis asthma , skin prick testing , pulmonary function test methacholine bronchoprovocation test . According sensitization , patient divide 2 parallel group either polysensitized monosensitized . Afterwards , patient group follow symptom medication scale , visual analog score , quality-of-life score 1 month placebo immunotherapy . During period , total serum IgE , specific IgE level measure use method UNI-CAP 100 ( Phadia , Uppsala , Sweden ) repeat placebo immunotherapy injection . At baseline , placebo ( 3 month ) immunotherapy injection ( third month maintenance period ) , nasal allergen provocation test Der p extract apply study group . Peripheral whole blood drawn analysis basophil activation marker CD203c ( CD , cell differentiation ) expression three time point . For clinical assessment , patient record diary card symptom score , visual analog scale score , medication usage , quality-of-life measure rhinitis asthma . On clinical visit , physical examination side effect collect diary card data . In conclusion , believe study may help understand immune response allergen specific immunotherapy early stage . On hand , similar clinical improvement demonstrate two group common single-allergen ( Der p ) immunotherapy , unnecessary usage multiple allergen may prevent well therapeutic side affect cost .</brief_summary>
