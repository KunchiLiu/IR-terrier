	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death worldwide crude incidence lung cancer European Union 52/100.000 per year mortality 47/100.000 per year . Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account approximately 80 % case . The five year survival NSCLC patient quite poor ( 16 % ) , mainly due patient diagnose advanced stage . However lung cancer detect treat earlier stage outcome survival much favorable five year survival rate 77 % . The current standard care small volume tumor surgical resection medically fit patient , consist lobectomy pneumonectomy accompany systematic mediastinal lymph node sample lymphadenectomy . For patient population small volume disease early stage surgery offer potential local tumor control 96 % patient . However , one quarter patient medically inoperable coexist morbidity poor general condition , mostly result long smoking history consecutive chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The main purpose trial ass effectiveness IG-SBRT ( Image guide stereotactic body radiotherapy ) patient medically inoperable early stage , centrally locate NSCLC willing undergo surgical treatment . Secondary objective study - ass safety treatment modality collect data acute late toxicity - pattern local distant recurrence relation site local recurrence clinical ( CTV ) plan target volume ( PTV ) - survival cause death</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LungTech : Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) Inoperable Centrally Located NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventionally fractionate radiotherapy ( RT ) standard care medically inoperable NSCLC prescribed dose usually 60 - 66 Gy.This moderate irradiation regimen result local failure rate approximately 50 % local failure- distant - show frequent pattern disease recurrence . Still , conventional RT result overall survival ( OS ) cancer specific survival ( CSS ) superior best supportive care , though clearly insufficient treatment CSS rate 30 % 5 year . Retrospective study report dose-response relationship local tumor control : high irradiation dos result improved rate local tumor control find translate improve OS . Simultaneously , dose- response relationship volume-effect relation demonstrate radiation induce pneumonitis , relevant toxicity RT . These relation know apply organ risk ( OAR ) include esophagus spinal cord . Consequently , traditional target volume concept conduct nodal irradiation clinically node negative patient traditional RT- planning delivery technique , low accuracy broad safety margin , allow routine application sufficient irradiation dos due high toxicity rate . In mid-90s , encouraging success treatment cerebral malignancy , concept stereotactic RT take cranium body . Only primary tumor target precise stereotactic tumor localization combine technique reduce breathing- induce target motion allow small safety margin . These small volume treat hypo-fractionated , escalated irradiation dos . Since , technique image guide ( IG ) -stereotactic body RT ( SBRT ) also know Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy ( SABR ) develop multiple clinical technological aspect e.g . Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / compute tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) base nodal staging , respiration correlate CT-imaging target volume definition image-guided treatment delivery . Safety efficacy demonstrate large series patient stage I NSCLC . The majority patient medically inoperable SBRT practice instead conventionally fractionate RT . However , safety SBRT demonstrate even high risk patient advanced age , severe COPD poor pulmonary function , would make curative approach except SBRT difficult even impossible . On side patient spectrum , retrospective study suggest equivalent outcome compare sub-lobar resection , confirm Markov model study .</detailed_description>
