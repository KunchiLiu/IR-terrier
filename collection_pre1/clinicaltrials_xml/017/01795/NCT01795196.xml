	<brief_summary>Integrated pulmonary index ( IPI ) tool monitor respiratory status . It take account four parameter : respiratory rate , end-tidal CO2 , heart rate O2 saturation use pulse oximeter specialize sidestream CO2 monitor . The device continuously monitor display patient 's ventilatory state single digit , 1-10 . In addition , trend kept provide early indication change respiratory status . IPI study pediatric patient sedation ; however , use monitor tool possibility . One possibility use IPI monitor pediatric patient wean extubation process determine specific number , less specific number , associate extubation failure . Therefore , clinician physician would well able determine patient ready extubation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Pulmonary Index ( IPI ) Determinate Weaning Success and/or Failure Pediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study design collect data IPI mechanically ventilate pediatric patient undergo wean process extubation use FDA approve Capnostream 20Â® bedside monitor ( CS20 ) ( Covidien Inc. , Mansfield , MA , USA ) . Inclusion criterion include patient intubate least 24 hour less 18 year age great 1 year age . Exclusion criterion include patient less 1 year age presence tracheostomy tube . The IPI number blind throughout study directly monitor value ( SpO2 , HR , PETCO2 , RR ) available clinical use . Upon meet inclusion criterion , subject give code number protect identity . Study personnel verify CS20 monitor match institutional time/date prior use de-identified subject ID enter CS20 monitor . The subject connect CS20 device via pulse oximeter probe CO2 sample line attach ventilator circuit , standard care monitoring ventilate pediatric patient . Subjects monitor 10 minute prior initiation physician direct wean evaluation extubation . Study personnel verify IPI number monitor visible clinician order prevent change routine intervention . Investigators record date , time , mechanical ventilator setting CS20 monitor start collect baseline data . Physician direct wean trial ventilator change test readiness extubation record correlate IPI value later date . Venous and/or arterial blood gas ( ABG ) data nebulizer treatment occur study record along PETCO2 ABG draw nebulizer treatment administer CS20 monitor mark event . For nebulizer treatment , mark event also push pump button pause IPI monitor 15 minute order prevent sample line become clog . CS 20 IPI monitoring automatically resume 15 minute pause pump . If weaning trial stop patient extubated , date time record monitor marked event . Subjects fail wean readiness determination process repeat three wean attempt . If weaned mechanical ventilation third attempt , participation trial terminate . Participation study terminate extubation occur within 72 hour enrollment . If extubated , event mark monitor date time record case report form ( CRF ) . After extubation , subject remain reconnected CS20 monitor via PETCO2 sample nasal cannula capable provide supplemental oxygen pulse oximeter . Subjects continue monitor 48 hour post extubation transfer ICU . If subject fail extubation require re-intubation use noninvasive ventilation , event time record study terminate . The subject may withdraw study anytime attend physician may terminate participation trial . Necessary protect health information ( PHI ) include subject name medical record number track subject 48 hour post extubation . PHI maintain site enrollment log separate collect data lock file cabinet . Quantitative data study include time stamped electronic parameter data subject ID CS20 ; CRF de-identified demographic information , significant pulmonary medical history , ventilator parameter prior extubation , method use determine readiness discontinue mechanical ventilation , number day mechanical ventilator , rapid shallow breathe index , VD/VT , ABG co-morbidity , date time extubation 48 hour post extubation status . Time stamp electronic parameter data CS20 obtain monitor via USB drive . Data CS20 store secure computer subject ID number . The de-identified subject demographic information , medical pulmonary history obtain subject 's electronic medical record study staff record CRF . The CRFs store Study Binder lock filling cabinet College Sciences . The Study Binder store secure location data retain three year .</detailed_description>
