	<brief_summary>There elevate risk acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) relate tibial shaft fracture due oedema reduce blood flow traumatise tissue . This may lead lack oxygen even necrosis . Symptoms ACS severe pain , hypoaesthesia , pain flexion ankle swell leg clinical examination . Paralysis lack distal pulse late symptom ACS . Many expert think effective relief pain cause regional anaesthesia ( RA ) may hide symptom ACS . This may incorrect . The evidence danger relate RA base old patient-series single case-reports . Some study report symptom ACS ( hypaesthesia even pain ) cause RA . Majority conclusion study confirm expert RA . It also possible hemodynamic change relate general anaesthesia ( GA ) may predispose ACS . There modern , randomize controlled study safety RA patient tibial shaft fracture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient RA may even safe GA . According large meta-analysis RA reduce risk several complication versus GA. - Risk deep vein thrombosis reduce 44 % - Risk pulmonary embolism reduce 55 % - Risk major bleeding reduce 50 % - Risk post operative pneumonia reduce 39 % - Risk post operative respiratory reduce 59 % It generally think RA safer GA example patient heart pulmonary disease . It also know use RA reduces postoperative need opioids , lead improved respiratory function reduce post operative disorientation , delirium nausea . Purpose study : Our purpose gain information safety RA patient tibial fracture . Our hypothesis RA equally safe GA . Implementation : Research begin pilot study RA compare GA . There 65 tibial fracture operate centre every year . We randomize patient GA group ( n=25 ) spinal anaesthesia group ( n=25 ) . We presume RA equally safe GA . However , power analysis make presume RA increase risk ACS . We calculate sample size assume compartment pressure RA group 10 mmHg high GA group . GA induct fentanyl , propofol rocuronium . GA maintain sevofluran , fentanyl rocuronium . Spinal-anaesthesia perform use hyperbaric bupivacaine . The dose 10-15 mg , depend need patient . This maintain RA low extremity 2-4 hour , enough operate tibial shaft fracture . In study group post-operative pain treat intravenous peroral oxycodone paracetamol . Monitoring ethic : - Clinical examination every hour recovery room ( oedema , temperature , cutaneous sensation , distal pulse ) - Continuous pressure-measurement anterior compartment operate leg 24 hour - Local oxygen metabolism measure near-infrared spectroscopy operate leg 24 hour Patients monitor recovery room 24 hour operation . Blood test ( creatine kinase myoglobin ) drawn operation , arrive recovery room , 6 hour 24 hour operation patient .</detailed_description>
