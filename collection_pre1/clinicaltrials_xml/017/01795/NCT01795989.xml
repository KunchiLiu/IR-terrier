	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test use new Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) coil . An MRI take picture body part use large magnet computer . A coil part MRI system collect data make MR image . The investigator design , develop , build two child-sized coil use image elbow , wrist , knee , ankle . These new coil well suit fit infant teenager rather conventional coil use create adult These MRI coil approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) consider investigational device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The safety clinical efficacy/equivalence two pediatric 1.5T coil evaluated/demonstrated two phase . Patient safety image quality evaluated/demonstrated Phase One collecting image healthy participant use combination exist commercially available coil new coil . Clinical efficacy/equivalence evaluated/demonstrated Phase Two collect standard MRI exam pediatric patient . In Phase Two , image data give patient collect one two follow scenario : 1 ) clinically order exams complete use combination exist commercially available coil new coil , image directly compare , 2 ) clinically order scan collect use one new coil image compare historical de-identified MR exam , age gender match patient data ( acquire use exist commercially available coil ) . Results Phase One report IRB . Phase Two begin IRB review result Phase One approve commencement Phase Two .</detailed_description>
