	<brief_summary>This randomize , control study compare patient evaluate primary care physicians alone versus patient additionally evaluated dermatologist primary care physician‟s office , aim demonstrate visit primary care physician‟s ( PCP ) office involve PCP on-site dermatology consultation reduce hospital admission rate . The hypothesis study obtain outpatient dermatology consultation patient‟s initial presentation primary care office reduce admission cellulitis accuracy . The primary objective measure difference proportion patient require hospital admission utilize dermatology consultation PCP‟s office ( active arm ) versus primary care evaluation alone ( control arm ) calculate risk ratio risk difference . The risk admission arm assess study complete . The secondary endpoint admission versus discharge home dermatology follow-up visit ass accuracy initial assessment . An additional endpoint determine difference frequency cellulitis admission exist base age immunosuppression . Exploratory analysis assess percentage patient concomitant know predispose factor recurrent cellulitis lymphedema , leg ulceration , tinea pedis , onychomycosis , well association fever &gt; 100.5 F history prior episode cellulitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assessing Impact Dermatology Consultation Patients Presenting With Possible Cellulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol study present outpatient internal medicine clinic identify primary care physician pain , redness , swell skin physician believe may represent cellulitis . Patient recruitment occur five Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) outpatient internal medicine clinical site : Medical Walk-In , Internal Medicine Associates , Bulfinch Medical Group , Senior Health , Women 's health . Patients abnormal vital sign exclude , specifically systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg , heart rate great 90 beat per minute le 50 beat per minute , respiratory rate great 20 , temperature &gt; 100.5 F. In addition , patient history transplantation must six month initial transplant treat episode acute rejection last 90 day , use antithymocyte globulin campath treat rejection last 6 month , 20 mg/day prednisone 30 day . Once patient identify potential cellulitis candidate outpatient treatment , primary care physician approach regard interest entering study . Patients randomized initial presentation primary care physician . The patient randomize treatment group obtain dermatology evaluation primary care physician‟s office send Emergency Department discharge home outpatient dermatology follow-up two three day assess improvement condition versus change worsen require transfer Emergency Department . Patients evaluated dermatologist require hospitalization transition Emergency Department manage dermatologist notification patient‟s PCP . These patient follow-up dermatology clinic require follow-up visit primary care physician . The skin lymph node exam perform dermatologist patient treatment group document electronic medical record subjects‟ medical record . Patients admit initial outpatient discharge follow-up visit consider treatment failure . A medical record review perform patient treatment group two week initial evaluation internal medicine clinic . A medical record review perform patient randomized treatment group two week initial evaluation internal medicine clinic . Those control group obtain dermatology evaluation follow primary care recommendation alone also chart review two week later assess admission versus discharge home clinic outcome . In control group , need additional clinical follow-up primary care physician‟s discretion . These patient receive followup telephone call confirm final outcome condition two week visit internal medicine clinic . The data set generate treatment control group compare look difference hospital admission rate . For treatment arm study , data obtain follow-up visit medical record review . For control arm , obtain medical record review follow-up phone call . The goal data collection determine final outcome patient group term need hospital admission .</detailed_description>
