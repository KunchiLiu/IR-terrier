	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study whole-body radiation therapy , systemic chemotherapy , high-dose chemotherapy follow stem cell rescue treat patient poor-risk Ewing sarcoma . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy peripheral blood stem cell bone marrow transplant stop growth tumor cell stop divide kill . After treatment , stem cell collect patient 's blood store . More chemotherapy give prepare bone marrow stem cell transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety feasibility whole-body magnetic resonance imaging ( WB-MRI ) -guided intensity modulate radiation therapy deliver concurrently systemic chemotherapy sit metastatic disease patient relapse , refractory and/or poor risk Ewing sarcoma . II . To assess safety feasibility novel consolidation regimen consist busulfan , melphalan topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) follow autologous stem cell rescue , administer immediately completion radiation therapy patient relapse , refractory and/or poor risk Ewing sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize time myeloid platelet engraftment . II . To estimate overall progression free survival probability . III . To estimate cumulative incidence relapse/progression non-relapse related mortality . IV . To report overall response rate ( overall response rate [ ORR ] : complete response [ CR ] +partial response [ PR ] ) response duration . V. To descriptively compare diagnostic imaging result ( number site bone metastasis ) whole-body MR imaging obtain skeletal scintigraphy . OUTLINE : BLOCK I : Patients receive etoposide intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour ifosfamide IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Patients also undergo WB-MRI-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy twice daily ( BID ) , 5 day week , approximately 4 week . Patients may also undergo 4 fraction stereotactic radiation therapy ( SRT ) every day ( QOD ) , 3-8 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) QOD , 10 fraction 3-dimensional radiation therapy ( 3D RT ) daily sit metastatic disease . BLOCK II : Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy comprise topotecan hydrochloride IV continuously 24 hour day -8 -4 , busulfan IV 2 hour every 6 hour day -8 -4 , melphalan IV 30 minute day -3 -2 . Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood bone marrow stem cell infusion day 0 . After stem cell infusion , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
