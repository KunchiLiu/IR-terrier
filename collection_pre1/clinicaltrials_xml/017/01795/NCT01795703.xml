	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Abiraterone Participants With Prostate Cancer Who Have Received Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center ( conducted one center ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single-arm study investigate safety efficacy abiraterone . The study consist 3 phase : Screening phase ( consist 14 day study commences Day -1 ) ; Treatment phase ( consist 28-daily dosing cycle wherein abiraterone 1000 milligram [ mg ] daily 5 mg prednisolone twice daily give disease progression unacceptable toxicity observe ) ; Follow-up phase ( 5 year survival first dose study drug ) . Abiraterone administer orally daily least 1 hour meal 2 hour meal . Dose reduction allow Investigator 's discretion lower 500 mg per day . Participants discontinue study treatment disease progression unless , Investigator 's opinion , deem participant continue derive benefit abiraterone . Efficacy evaluate primarily decline prostate-specific antigen ( substance blood measure check prostate cancer ) 12 week therapy . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
