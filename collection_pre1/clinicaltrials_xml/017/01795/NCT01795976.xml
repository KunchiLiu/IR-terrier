	<brief_summary>This trial adoptive T cell therapy use patient 's T cell , genetically engineer target tumour associate antigen NY-ESO-1 ( New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 ) . Eligible patient undergo leukapheresis ( process remove white blood cell ) retrieve sufficient T cell gene modify expanded laboratory . Patients undergo precondition chemotherapy cyclophosphamide ( 60mg/kg ) day -7 day -6 , follow fludarabine ( 25mg/m2 ) day -5 day -1 . The NY-ESO-1 gene modify cell re-infused day 0 patient receive 14 dos intravenous Interleukin2 ( 100000 U/kg ) day 0 day 4 . The primary objective response rate accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion assess CT scan carry week 6 , week 12 12 weekly interval thereafter .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm oesophagogastric cancer confirm evidence metastatic disease fail refused standard therapy . There must measurable disease Patients may previous systemic therapy provide otherwise fit treatment Age equal great 18 year World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 0 1 Patients must HLAA2 positive Their tumour must stain positive immunohistochemistry NYESO1 ( either diagnostic recent biopsy acceptable ) Life expectancy &gt; 3months Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 50 % measure ECHO Multi Gated Acquisition Scan ( MUGA ) Haematological biochemical index : Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 8.0 g/dL Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 10*9/L Platelets ( Plts ) ≥ 100 x 10*9/L Any follow abnormal baseline liver function test : serum bilirubin ≤ 20 mmol/l ( ULN ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and/or ≤ 3 x ULN unless patient liver metastasis &lt; 5 x ULN . Serum creatinine ≤ 0.15 mmol/L creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min These measurement must perform prior leukaphereses prior commence precondition chemotherapy . The chemotherapy use trial nonmyeloablative , patient previous high dose chemotherapy , autologous haemopoietic stem cell backup harvest , stem cell rescue , obtain prior commence therapy trial . Similarly , concern patient 's bone marrow reserve , example due multiple previous line myelosuppressive chemotherapy backup stem cell harvest also obtain . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test prior treatment agree use appropriate medically approve contraceptive precaution four week prior enter trial , trial , six month afterwards . Male patient must agree use barrier method contraception treatment six month afterwards . Able provide full write informed consent . Those receive radiotherapy , biological therapy , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy , systemic steroid , chemotherapy previous four week ( six week nitrosoureas MitomycinC ) prior treatment course treatment . All toxic manifestation previous treatment must resolve . Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , investigator considers exclude patient . Participation clinical trial within previous 30 day course treatment . Previous allogeneic transplant . Clinically significant cardiac disease . Patients high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease , include active infection , uncontrolled cardiac respiratory disease , serious medical psychiatric disorder lead clinician opinion would make patient good candidate adoptive Tcell therapy . Concurrent serious infection within 28 day prior treatment Current malignancy sit , exception adequately treat conebiopsied situ carcinoma cervix uteri basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients know find serologically positive Hepatitis B , C , HIV Human T cell lymphotropic Virus ( HTLV ) . History systemic autoimmune disease could lifethreatening reactivation occur ( example hypothyroidism would permissible , prior rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE0 would ) . Evidence Centra Nervous System ( CNS ) involvement . Patients likely require systemic steroid immunosuppressive therapy . Pregnant lactating woman . Radiotherapy &gt; 25 % skeleton .</criteria>
