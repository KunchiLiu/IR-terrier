	<brief_summary>Nutritional anemia major public health problem among child woman develop country . Despite ongoing national program supplementing pregnant woman iron-folate , prevalence anemia 39 % among pregnant woman 78 % among infant Bangladesh . Vitamin B12 deficiency prevalent cause megaloblastic anemia folate many develop country . This data raise interest address role vitamin B12 deficiency nutritional anemia . Low dietary intake animal product , predominant source vitamin B12 may cause anemia . Besides maintain normal erythropoiesis , B12 essential immune function . However , study evaluate effect maternal B12 supplementation reduction anemia improve immunity infant . The investigator hypothesize vitamin B12 supplementation plus iron-folate pregnancy 3-mo postpartum would : ( ) Decrease anemia among mother infant ; ( b ) Improve vaccine specific cellular humoral immune response among mother ; ( c ) Improve vaccine specific immunity infant passive transfer ; ( ) Improve DNA methylation one-carbon metabolism mother-child pair ; ( e ) Reduce antenatal/postnatal depression . Results study guide provide support policy maker identify effective strategy reduce nutritional anemia population risk . The investigator aim conduct double-masked placebo control trial investigate add effect vitamin B12 iron-folate supplementation among pregnant woman . Anemic ( Hb level &lt; 11.0 g/dl ) mother 11-14 week gestation randomize two group : supplement group receive 250 ug vitamin B12 plus 400 ug folate 60 mg iron ; placebo group receive folate iron . This daily supplementation continue 3-mo postpartum . At 26-28 wk gestation mother give inactivated influenza vaccine . Data anthropometric index mother child , birth size , infant growth morbidity ( mother child ) throughout study period record . 24-h dietary recall data collect mother bimonthly throughout study . Biochemical indicator anemia include Hb , vitamin B12 , ferritin , folate α-glycoprotein ( AGP ) assess plasma mother ( pre- post-supplementation ) infant ( cord blood 3-months ) . Additional measurement include serum transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) plasma methyl malonic acid ( MMA ) total homocysteine ( tHcy ) urine mother . Plasma vaccine specific antibody response measure mother ( pre- post supplementation ) infant ( cord blood 3-months ) . In breast milk , B12 , folate s-IgA determine . Genetic polymorphism ( one-carbon metabolism ) DNA methylation study mother cord blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Area : A maternity clinic Mirpur substantial number pregnant woman enrol month ( 300-400/month ) select recruitment local pregnant woman . The community Mirpur low out-migration rate . Pregnant woman attend clinic 11-14 week gestation plan deliver clinic ensure safe delivery select . The structured service standard antenatal care clinic safe delivery antenatal care provide study participant . Study Population : Pregnant woman ( n=120 ) screen 11-14 week gestation . Infants ( n=120 ) 3 month age . Inclusion Criteria : - Hb level range 7.0-11 g/dL - Age : 22-35 year - Mothers begin second trimester ( i.e . 11-14 week gestation ) - Willing stay Dhaka pregnancy willing get admit clinic delivery - Self-reported Last Menstrual Period ( LMP ) urine pregnancy test use determine gestational age . Exclusion Criteria : - Women severe anemia ; hemoglobin concentration &lt; 7.0 g/dL - History presence systemic disease - H/O previous complicate pregnancy pre-term delivery , abortion - Receipt influenza vaccine Definition : According WHO , anemia define hemoglobin concentration &lt; 12 g/dL adult woman . Anemia categorize mild ( 10-11.9 g/dL ) , moderate ( 7.0-9.9 g/dL ) severe ( &lt; 7.0 g/dL ) . Study design : A double-blind control trial ; After inform consent obtain , pregnant woman randomly assign either Placebo group ( N=60 ) receive 60 mg Fe 400µg folate daily Supplementation group ( N=60 ) receive 250 µg vitamin B12 addition 60 mg Fe 400µg folate . A third party ( GlaxoSmithKline , Bangladesh ) prepare supply vitamin B12 placebo capsule bottle . The two capsule similar appearance taste . They label bottle A B . The responsible personnel Company keep confidential end study . The capsule either A B receive 1st participant determine lottery , thereafter every alternate participant receive capsule . The IDs participant give sequentially . The daily supplementation iron-folate well B12 continue 3-months postpartum . At 26-28 week gestation , mother receive single inactivate , trivalent influenza virus vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) . Standard inactivate trivalent influenza recommend WHO Northern Hemisphere obtain commercial source project ( GlaxoSmithKline ; Dresden , Germany ) . Field worker ( FW ) deliver two week ' dose either placebo supplement mother person check compliance card leave pill . The pregnant woman clearly instructed time subsequent follow-up visit , follow respective home remind date . Routine Service : The routine care provide clinic include Hb measurement , physical examination ( weight , blood pressure , pulse rate , abdominal check-up , fetal heart rate , ultrasonographic examination necessary ) , counsel diet , description normal procedure pregnancy , associate potential complication , go clinic event etc . This service provide clinic physician assistance nurse . Specimens : Fasting peripheral blood collect mother 11 14 week gestation , cord blood delivery , colostrum within 24 hour breast milk peripheral blood mother three month postpartum . Peripheral blood infant collect three month age . Blood collect anticoagulant ( EDTA ) coat tubes layered Ficoll-paque density gradient centrifugation ; plasma separate top store -70ºC later analysis . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) separate study cellular immune response . Urine collect mother 11 - 14 week gestation three month . For gene base study , DNA sample delinked identity make anonymous accord standard procedure . Methods : Total hemoglobin ( Hb ) whole blood measure spectrophotometry use Drabakins Reagent ( Sigma Diagnostics ) . Standardized blood smear stain use evaluate megaloblastic anemia ( presence macroovalocytes hypersegmented neutrophil ) . Ferritin , serum transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) α-glycoprotein ( AGP ) measure plasma enzyme immune assay . Vitamin B12 folate plasma vitamin B12 breast milk assay Roche autoanalyzer Cobas e411 . Urinary methyl malonic acid ( MMA ) measure fluorescence detector assist HPLC method ( Sigma Diagnostics , St. Louis , MO . Briefly MMA extract urine sample ethyl acetate . The extract dry derivatized monodansylcadaverine dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide prior injection HPLC . Ethylmalonic acid use internal standard . Influenza vaccine-specific antibody response ( IgA , IgG ) plasma colostrum/ breast milk [ secretory IgA ( s-IgA ) ] measure ELISA . PBMC stimulate Flu vaccine blastogensis response . Genomic DNA methylation measure methyl acceptance assay base ability isolate DNA `` accept '' radiolabeled methyl group S- [ 3H-methyl ] adenosylmethionine , use bacterial CpG methyltransferase SssI . Total homocysteine ( tHcy ) measure urine sample use HPLC fluorimetric detection Thiols column effluent detect single gold-mercury electrode . NaBH4 use reductant , derivatization sample require . Mutations ALPL , MTHFR C677T FUT2 gene determine PCR- RFLP assay DNA sequencing . All assay perform Nutritional Biochemistry Lab facility determine biochemical marker anemia , vaccine specific antibody response , DNA methylation polymorphism assay . Assessment anthropometry morbidity : Maternal anthropometrical measurement take begin supplementation monthly post supplementation period train FWs . Birth weight recumbent length take within 72 hour birth monthly measurement take FW 3 mo age . At visit ( fortnightly ) , Field Research Assistant ( FRA ) collect data mother morbidity mother infant ( e.g . diarrhoea , respiratory infection , skin disease , assessment severity disease episode ) previous 7 day use structured questionnaire . The FRAs inform woman time first subsequent follow-up visit , ensure understood clearly . In addition , study participant contact cell phone available remind visit date . When follow respective home , remind next visit date . Depression score : Participants interview mental status use Centre Epidemiological Studies-Depression ( CES-D ) questionnaire . The questionnaire contain 20 item comprise six major aspect depression : depressed mood , hopelessness , worthlessness , fatigue , appetite sleep disturbance . It translate Bengali pilot early study involve woman felt precede 7 day . It previously use rural urban Bangladeshi woman ( Hamadani , unpublished data ) find correlate sensibly child 's growth development . The FRAs extensively train interview woman inter-observer reliability obtain study . The interview conduct twice home woman FRAs ' visit , first baseline 3 mo postpartum . The data analyze interpreted one co-investigators ( JDH ) knowledge experience deal type information . Food security dietary diversity : The effect food insecurity food intake , health nutritional status observe many develop country show significantly low total daily per caput food expenditures food-insecure household food-secure household . Food insecurity associate maternal anxiety depression , strong negative influence infant care practice include breastfeed duration well child nutritional status . About half Bangladeshi population food-insecure . Hunger childhood malnutrition Bangladesh among high world . About 31 % rural population Bangladesh suffer `` chronic poverty '' 19 % rural household `` full three meal '' day . Thus , household food insecurity relation enormous impact health nutritional status human grow concern Bangladesh . Household food security status dietary diversity study participant ( include maternal dietary energy , protein , vitamin B-12 folate intake ) assess first , baseline pregnant woman enrol study thereafter fortnightly throughout study . USDA food composition database use assess vitamin B-12 intake . Any seasonal variation food security status assess might significant impact outcome measure . Structured questionnaire food security module use measure household food security status . The FRAs train interview woman ; take interview make visit antenatal postnatal period home . The data analyze interpreted one co-investigators ( KKS ) knowledge experience deal type information .</detailed_description>
