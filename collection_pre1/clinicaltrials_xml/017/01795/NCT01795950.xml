	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study assess safety PLX-PAD treat pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . PLX-PAD cell-based product make allogeneic Mesenchymal-like Adherent Stromal Cells ( ASCs ) , derive human full-term placenta follow elective caesarean section . This year-long study evaluate safety three different dose level PLX-PAD , give single intravenous infusion . This study also evaluate effect PLX-PAD may PAH , change ability exercise test use measure disease severity .</brief_summary>
