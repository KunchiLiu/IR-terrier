	<brief_title>A Long-term , Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy Study Retigabine Immediate-release ( IR ) Asian Adults With Partial Onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects successfully complete Maintenance Phase Study RTG114855 ( parent study ) expect benefit therapy retigabine IR eligible OLE study . The study consist Screening ( 1 day ) , Open-Label Treatment Follow-up ( 3 week ) phase . Subjects initially receive start dose retigabine IR 900 milligram ( mg ) /day concurrent antiepileptic drug ( AED ) regimen receive final visit Transition Phase parent study . After first week OLE study , dose retigabine IR may adjust 600 1200 mg/day , dose adjustment increment decrement 150 mg/week , base efficacy tolerability . In addition , dose number concurrent AEDs may also adjust meet individual subject 's need . The efficacy safety issue assess throughout study ; subject instruct call investigator experience efficacy tolerability issue study visit . As duration study determine base follow four condition : 1 ) regulatory approval commercialisation retigabine IR ; 2 ) retigabine IR approve regulatory authority ; 3 ) study terminate Sponsor reason include , limited , safety issue ; 4 ) subject withdrawn withdraws consent , 4 year consider guide duration study . The safety tolerability endpoint incidence severity adverse event ( AEs ) ; proportion subject AEs lead discontinuation ; change Baseline vital sign measurement weight ; change Baseline electrocardiogram parameter ; change Baseline haematology , chemistry , urinalysis parameter ; change Baseline American Urological Association Symptom Index post-void residual bladder ultrasound volume ; summary Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale . Efficacy assess calculate percent change Baseline ( parent study ) 28-day total POS frequency entire open-label Treatment Phase OLE study . This also calculate base duration exposure . Responder rate ( define &gt; /=50 % reduction Baseline 28-day total POS frequency ) also summarise entire open-label Treatment Phase duration exposure .</detailed_description>
