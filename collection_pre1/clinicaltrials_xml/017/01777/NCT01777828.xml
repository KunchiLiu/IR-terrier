	<detailed_description>Aortic valve stenosis serious chronic life-threatening short medium term since onset functional symptom . Aortic valve replacement surgery currently treatment choice . It do surgery sternotomy extracorporeal circulation . However , despite considerable improvement condition care per post operative , procedure sometimes burden high mortality , especially population severe co-morbidities / many . For reason , patient consider indicated surgery high surgical risk . The recent development aortic valve bioprostheses implant new approach ( pressure transapical ) consider aortic valve replacement population previously exclude . Based thorough evaluation valve test bench animal well human settlement achieve multiple study registry mono multi patient challenge cardiac surgeon consider high surgical risk , clear implementation valve could allow , condition optimal implementation monitoring , improve short-and long-term clinical status , quality life prognosis patient . FRANCE 2 registry , establish 2010 , whose inclusion end 30 June 2012 allow initial assessment aortic valve bioprostheses implant catheter The following registry France 2 request high authority health , FRANCE register TAVI perform continuity FRANCE 2 . It take account first data FRANCE 2 . Data Report Form reduce , new item add , carry center authorize France implement technique . The collection data TAVI France condition FRANCE 2 , database manage French Society Cardiology</detailed_description>
