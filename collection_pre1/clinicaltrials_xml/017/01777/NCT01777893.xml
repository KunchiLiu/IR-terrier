	<detailed_description>Type-2 diabetes one fast grow chronic disease worldwide . This trend mainly driven global increase prevalence obesity . The PREVIEW study initialize find effective lifestyle-components ( diet physical activity ) prevention T2D . The project randomize lifestyle-intervention . The main aim determine preventative impact high-protein low-GI diet combination moderate high intensity physical activity incidence T2D predispose , pre-diabetic child , young old adult ( gender ) . In substudies follow assess ; change fat distribution ( adult ) , risk colon cancer biomarkers ( fecal sample adult ) , change physical fitness ( VO2 max adult ) , metabolomics profile ( adult ) , food reward ( child adolescent ) sleep architecture ( child adolescent ) . Objective : The project address prevention individual high risk T2D . The trial perform 6 EU country ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Finland , Spain , Netherlands , United Kingdom ) , well Australia New Zealand . Study design : The PREVIEW intervention study carry 3-year randomize , clinical intervention consist initial 8-week weight loss period 148 week randomize weight maintenance intervention . Study population : A total 2500 adult well 150 child adolescent participant participate intervention . All adult participant first treat low-calorie diet 8 week , aim reach &gt; 8 % weight reduction . In skeletal immature child weight loss desirable goal maintain weight ( gain length ) initial 8 week . Intervention : The two diet intervention participant : HP = high-protein : protein 25 E % , carbohydrates 45 E % , dietary glycaemic index ( GI ) &lt; 50 . MP = moderate-protein : protein intake 15 % total energy intake ( E % ) , carbohydrates 55 E % , GI &gt; 56 ; Both diet compose use healthy food item . The two exercise intervention : MI = moderate-intensity : 60—75 % maximal heart rate ( HRmax ) , e.g. , brisk walking ; HI = high intensity : 76—90 % HRmax , e.g. , run . The randomization adult stratify sex age group , sex child . The participant supervise group LCD ( 4 time ) throughout weight-maintenance period . Children supervise separately . Meeting frequency reduce towards end study . The main assessment point ( clinical investigation day , CID ) week 0 ( start weight reduction ) , week 8 ( end weight reduction/start randomize intervention ) , week 26 ( 6 month baseline ) , week 52 ( 12 month baseline ) , week 78 ( 18 month baseline ) week 104 ( 24 month baseline ) week 156 ( 36 month baseline / End Trial , EOT ) . For child adolescent last assessment point week 104 ( 24 month baseline/ End Trial , EOT ) . Main study endpoint : The primary endpoint intervention study adult incidence Type-2 diabetes 3 year ( 156 week ) accord diet ( high protein versus moderate protein , adjusted physical activity ) , base 75 g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . The incidence diabetes assess annually participant self-report medication require diabetes , doctor inform ( confirm ) diabetes diagnosis diabetes diagnose fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) and/or OGTT accord IDF guideline . For child adolescent : Change insulin resistance 2 year randomization high protein versus medium protein diet , measured insulin resistance analyze homeostatic model ( HOMA-IR ) well physiological improvement health respect pre-diabetic characteristic . Secondary endpoint ( test four possible combination diet physical activity state otherwise ) effect high intensity vs. moderate intensity physical activity incidence type 2 diabetes , base WHO/IDF criterion ( adjust diet ) ; change HbA1c ( measure average blood glucose level ) , body weight waist , hip thigh circumference ; change body fat mass ( kg , proportion body weight ) ; proportion subject maintain least 0 , 5 10 % weight loss ( relative initial body weight ) ; insulin sensitivity ( Matsuda Index base OGTT , glucose insulin area curve ( AUC ) OGTT , beta-cell disposition index ) ( adult ) ; risk factor cardiovascular disease , least follow measure : blood pressure , lipid ( triglyceride , total , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol ) , C-reactive protein , liver enzymes ; change perceive quality life workability , habitual well-being chronic stress , sleep duration quality ( accelerometer questionnaire ) , appetite sensation , habitual ( long-term ) physical activity . Substudies . Fat distribution : Assessment fat distribution MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) H-MRS ( Hydrogen Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ) do sub-group subject University Maastricht : 20 HPMI 20 MPMI group . MRI/H-MRS non-invasive non-irradiant imaging technique , use determine abdominal fat muscle mass upper part lower limb ( MRI ) , muscle liver fat ( H-MRS ) . MRI H-MRS measurement take place week 0 , 26 104 . Sampling analysis DNA RNA : The intend use sample epi/genetic analysis relation obesity associate disease . Genetic sample take place week 0 , 52 156 . Metabolomics profile : In sub-group subject , urine baseline week 0 week 52 analyzed metabolomics profile . Fecal sample : Full fecal sample 3 consecutive day collect sub-group . The sample use assessment colon cancer risk marker , ie phenolic metabolite , short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) , nitrogenous compound . Subjects recruit four group consecutive invitation basis . Moreover , sample subject store potential analysis microbiota . Fecal sample collect week 0 52 . Sleep architecture : In sub-study identify mediate role sleep pattern ( sleep quality duration ) , stress brain plasticity protein/ activity intervention outcome parameter . The sub-study assessing role sleep brain plasticity conduct repeated measure design embed main intervention study . Measurements take 0 , 26 104 week . Food reward : A possible relationship peripheral insulin sensitivity brain reward activation assess sub-group pre-diabetic adult , consist 2 stratified intervention group . The sub-study take place University Maastricht use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) block design high calorie/ low calorie food image control image . Measurements food reward do week 0 , 26 , 104 . Cost-effectiveness : All adult participant fill short questionnaire medicine use , day absent work , `` less optimal '' workability etc . These answer use estimate cost-effectiveness life-style program PREVIEW . Cost-effectiveness assess week 0 , 52 , 104 , 156 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For adult : 1 . Age 25 70 year 2 . Overweight obesity status BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 3 . Prediabetes The criterion WHO/IDF ( International Diabetes Foundation ) assess prediabetes use formal inclusion criterion ( screen ) , i.e . : Impaired Fasting Glucose ( IFG ) : Fasting venous plasma glucose concentration 5.6 6.9 mmol/l Impaired Glucose Tolerance ( IGT ) : Venous Plasma glucose concentration 7.8 11.0 mmol/l 2 h oral administration 75 g glucose ( oral glucose tolerance test , OGTT ) , fast plasma glucose le 7.0 mmol/l . Due potential betweenlab variation ( local assessment ) , HbA1c use inclusion criterion screen . 4 . Informed consent require 5 . Ethnic group No restriction 6 . Smoking Smoking allow , provide subject recently ( within 1 month ) change habit . However , smoke status monitor throughout study use confound variable . 7 .
