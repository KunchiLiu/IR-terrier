	<brief_summary>This study do people infected HIV , show sign HIV . They also feel well without take HIV medication low undetectable level virus blood . The purpose study see take HIV medication ( antiretroviral therapy [ ART ] ) reduce immune activation ( signal body fight infection ) people HIV , show symptom . Also study help determine safe drug well people react drug . For study , follow antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) provide form single tablet contains three different drug : emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/RPV/TDF ) . These drug combine one tablet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) single pill treat HIV infection . The HIV medication provide one recommended treatment HIV , include people low viral load ( much HIV body ) take HIV drug first time . The risk see HIV medication one would encounter take drug outside study .</brief_summary>
