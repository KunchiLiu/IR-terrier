	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma multiform ( GBM ) common malignant primary brain tumor adult . Despite maximal treatment tumor relapse occur regularly accompany unfavourable prognosis . Among reason , believe could part due existence so-called tumor stem cell ( TSCs ) , cellular subfraction within GBM escape therapy highly resistant irradiation chemotherapy thus constitute source tumor recurrence . GBM , like many cancer , show sub-population aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) overexpressing TSCs . More specifically , ALDH1A1 , cytoplasmatic isoform ALDH , prove novel stem cell marker human GBM . In addition , ALDH1A1 show mediator resistance GBM temozolomide ( TMZ ) reliable predictor clinical outcome ; prognosis patient high level ALDH1A1 expression poor compare patient low level . Consequently , ALDH1A1 may serve potential target improve treatment human GBM inhibition enzyme . Disulfiram ( DSF ) use sixty year treatment chronic alcoholism unpleasant symptom provokes ethanol intake . The underlie mechanism believe accumulation acetaldehyde blood , due inhibition liver ALDHs . Actually , DSF strong inhibitor ALDH1A1 relatively non-toxic therapeutic ( chronic alcoholism ) dose penetrate blood-brain barrier . In addition , DSF show cytotoxic GBM stem-like cell , inhibit growth TMZ resistant GBM cell block self-renewal ~100 % , identify inhibitor human GBM stem cell high-throughput chemical screen . Interestingly , number action copper-dependent . In current Phase II clinical trial , DSF/copper combination test adjunctive concurrent chemotherapy treatment newly diagnose GBM . According hypothesis , initiation DSF chemotherapy resection tumor introduction standard radio-chemotherapy inhibit ALDH1A1 GBM TSCs make susceptible radio-chemotherapy possibly reduce recurrence rate GBM . On hand , addition copper probably enhance cytotoxic effect DSF possibly augmentation pro-apoptotic proteasomal inhibitory action .</brief_summary>
