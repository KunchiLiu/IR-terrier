Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior first study product administration negative pregnancy test day placebo administration/ vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion study . Known history HBV infection . Previous vaccination hepatitis B . Positive antihepatitis B surface ( HBs ) antibody , antihepatitis B core ( HBc ) antibody , HBsAg , HCV antibodies and/or HIV . Any previous administration vaccine component . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study vaccine within 30 day precede first study product administration , plan use study period . No significant dietary restriction lifethreatening food allergy . Regular use non steroidal antiinflammatory drug within 1 month prior first study product administration . Chronic administration ( defined 14 day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within 6 month prior first study product administration.. Inhaled topical steroid allow . Planned administration / administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day first study product administration entire study period ( Steps ) , exception influenza vaccine ( pandemic seasonal ) administer &gt; 21 day precede &gt; 21 day follow placebo/vaccine administration . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within last 3 month precede first study product administration plan administration study period . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , include HIV base screen evaluation medical history physical examination . History current bleeding coagulation disorder . Any known clinical sign anaemia clinical condition ( include vascular disorder ) would preclude frequent blood drawing . Poor venous access assess screen investigator . Blood loss , include blood donation , 300 mL within 90 day first study product administration . History current autoimmune immunemediated disease . Any haematological biochemical level normal range enter study , follow : Haemoglobin level &lt; low normal limit ( LNL ) . Platelet count normal range .
