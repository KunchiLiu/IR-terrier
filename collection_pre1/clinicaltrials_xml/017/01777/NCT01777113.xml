	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause chronic disability worldwide . After stroke , patient remain continued high risk recurrent stroke well myocardial infarction cardiac death . Comorbid cardiovascular condition present 75 % stroke patient , represent lead cause death stroke survivor . Due low level physical activity , stroke survivor deconditioned , leading loss functional social independence subsequent decline quality life . Interventions improve cardiorespiratory fitness still part routine neurorehabilitation program many rehabilitation center , therapy often dominate standard rehabilitative therapy base neurodevelopmental principle Bobath concept . These standard therapy insufficient stimulus increase fitness level stroke . The first aim study evaluate effect high intensitive physical training improve cardiorespiratory fitness gait ability chronic stroke patient . The second aim compare effect high aerobic interval treadmill train maximal strength training chronic stroke patient . Patients randomize three group . The first group ( experimental group ) subject 3-month training period ( 3 sessions/week ) high intensity aerobic training treadmill . The second group ( experimental group group ) undergo strength train duration frequency first group . The third group ( control group ) subject conventional training duration frequency experimental group . Data analyse mean parametric non-parametric test . Both , within group comparison perform . As primary outcome measure consider peak oxygen uptake , walk energy cost , 6 minute walk test . As secondary outcome measure consider 10-meter Walking Test , Time Up Go test , Activities- specific balance confidence scale , SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire , Stroke Impact Scale , Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope ( OUES ) , arterial-venous oxygen difference ; cardiac output muscle strength .</detailed_description>
