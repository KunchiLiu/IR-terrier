	<brief_summary>Our primary objective develop clinical pathway care patient colorectal surgery Clinic . In particular , investigator would like determine intraoperative concentration oxygen optimal patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplemental Oxygen Colorectal Surgery : A Quality Improvement Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator therefore propose test primary hypothesis supplemental oxygen ( 80 % versus 30 % ) reduce risk composite surgical site infection potentially oxygen-related wound complication . Secondarily , investigator assess incremental cost benefit 80 % versus 30 % oxygen . As safety measure , enough oxygen always give maintain oxygen saturation ( determined pulse oximetry ) â‰¥95 % .</detailed_description>
