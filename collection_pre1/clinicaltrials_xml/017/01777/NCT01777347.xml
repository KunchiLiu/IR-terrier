	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether nebulized hypertonic saline solution reduce admission rate 48 hour initial treatment emergency department , compare normal saline solution ( control ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy 3 % Hypertonic Saline Acute Viral Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute viral bronchiolitis remain significant cause hospitalization date , treatment reduce rate hospitalization . The accepted treatment bronchiolitis nasal cleaning , hydration hospitalize hypoxemic infant , oxygen administration . Several study show nebulization hypertonic saline solution reduce length stay hospital hospitalize infant effect rate hospitalization remain unclear . The investigator propose randomize double blind multicenter clinical trial infant 6 week 12 month old moderate severe bronchiolitis , 21 emergency department hospital situate France , 2 winter season . The investigator hypothesize infant bronchiolitis treat nebulized hypertonic 3 % saline solution would less risk hospitalize . Our principal objective determine nebulized 3 % hypertonic saline solution reduce admission rate 24 hour treatment compare placebo . Secondary objective compare group intensity respiratory symptom measure RDAI clinical score , duration symptom , length hospital stay hospitalize infant , adverse effect health care utilization . Patients present Emergency Department diagnosis moderately severe bronchiolitis approach entry study . After initial routine assessment , informed consent obtain infant randomized receive treatment double-blinded fashion 4 ml nebulized study solution either 3 % hypertonic saline ( HS , study group ) 0.9 % saline ( NS , control group ) every 20 minute total 2 dos . After observation period 20 minute follow last dose , infant reassess attend physician ER disposition ( admit , discharge home ) . All subsequent therapy , need , sole discretion attend physician . The family recruit subject contact phone 2 , 7 , 14 28 day later assess resolution symptom . Clinical response treatment also determine independently study physician utilize standardized respiratory score system , Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument ( RDAI ) , study entry nebulization . The primary outcome measure rate admission hospital study control group 24 hour inclusion . Secondary outcome measure involve assessment change RDAI study entry post-treatment , adverse effect , length stay hospitalize infant health care utilization .</detailed_description>
