	<brief_title>The Effect Patellar Eversion Functional Outcomes Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patellar mobilization total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) debate , proponent minimally invasive TKA suggest laterally retract , rather evert patella may beneficial . It hypothesis use randomize , prospective , blind study method , would significant difference clinical outcome measure base solely eversion patella total knee arthroplasty . Methods : After priori power analysis do , 120 primary total knee replacement indicate degenerative joint disease include study randomize one two patella exposure technique : lateral retraction eversion . Collaborating investigator patient blind randomization .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients eligible study participation include comer primary total knee arthroplasty indicate degenerative joint disease .
