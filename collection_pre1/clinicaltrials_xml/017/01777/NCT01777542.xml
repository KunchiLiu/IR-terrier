	<brief_summary>Investigators recruit child clinical trial use medication recombinant human IGF-1 ( a.k.a . mecasermin INCRELEX ) see improve health child Rett syndrome ( RTT ) . While IGF-1 approve Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) certain use child , consider investigational drug trial previously use treat RTT . Information study help determine IGF-1 effectively treat RTT necessarily lead FDA approval IGF-1 treatment RTT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Rett Syndrome With Recombinant Human IGF-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolled subject complete five study period : screening , two 20-week long treatment period , 28-week break treatment period ( `` washout '' ) , follow-up phone call 4 week treatment end . Subjects choose random receive either IGF-1 placebo first treatment period switch alternate medication second treatment period . Therefore , completion trial , subject receive treatment IGF-1 20 week . The study double-blinded ; meaning , neither subject ' family study investigator know receive IGF-1 placebo time . Treatment must administer caregiver twice daily subcutaneous ( underneath skin ) injection . Caregivers train research nurse administer medication . Participation study last approximately eighteen month . Throughout course trial , investigator collect information ass effect IGF-1 monitor safety . Families must attend study visit Boston Children 's Hospital total seven time ( include screen visit ) course 18 month . These visit complete hospital . Parents fill questionnaire undergo structure interview report child 's health , behavior , mood . Subjects undergo clinical physical examination study doctor . Non-invasive device camera also use monitor thing like breathing , hand movement , heart rate , body temperature . Blood urine collect routine laboratory test monitor safety . Investigators also monitor safety ask parent complete medication diary side effect report form regular basis . Between trip Boston Children 's Hospital , parent complete set online questionnaires undergo structure interview phone . The cost travel lodge research-related visit hospital cover study . If condition illness identify trial ( determine unrelated study treatment ) , referral outside medical care make . Study medications research-related material service provide cost participant . Parking voucher provide study-related hospital visit . The study investigate 5 potential effect : 1 . IGF-1 may improve subject ' behavior , communication and/or mood . In order measure , investigator evaluate subject every 5 week throughout treatment period behavioral psychological assessment . All test use evaluation non-invasive . Investigators ask parent impression child 's behavior day-to-day activity structure parental interview various questionnaire . 2 . Investigators examine subject ' brain function use brain- monitoring device know electroencephalography ( EEG ) . The EEG measurement take investigator present subject exercise stimulate vision hearing . EEG non-invasive way record electrical activity subject 's brain applying net monitor ( electrode ) scalp . Through method investigator gain insight brain process visual auditory stimulus . 3 . As one feature RTT unstable vital sign , investigator try determine IGF-1 effect normalize subject ' heart rate breathing pattern . To measure , investigator ask subject wear non-invasive device include three electrocardiogram connector two stretchy band wrap around chest abdomen measure heart rate respiratory pattern . 4 . The safety IGF-1 child RTT important . Investigators ask parent complete medication diary side effect report form regular basis . In addition , laboratory test perform every 10 week throughout treatment period evaluate safety IGF-1 . These blood test similar provide typical clinical care . Subjects undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical neurological examination , tonsil evaluation , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , echocardiogram , scoliosis x-ray , bone age x-ray , ophthalmological exam , measurement height , weight head circumference . 5 . Children RTT often experience unintended , stereotype hand movement . The Qsensor® non-invasive device worn fabric bracelet continually measure subject ' movement . Investigators use Qsensor® determine whether IGF-1 affect presentation stereotype hand movement . As , investigator ask subject wear Qsensor® study visit every 10 week throughout treatment period occasionally home .</detailed_description>
