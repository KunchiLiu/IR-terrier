	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) frequent hospital acquire infection patient underwent surgery . With regard increase financial restraint patient care , socio-economic burden SSI public health sector prevention gain importance . The prophylactic application antibiotic ( surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis , SAP ) prior skin incision significantly reduce risk SSI , correct time point drug administration remain unclear . Most study recommend application SAP directly prior skin incision . Other study , however , suggest late time administration SAP skin incision necessary optimal SSI prevention . A large cohort study Switzerland conclude SAP apply 74 30 minute prior skin incision . Due obvious importance controversy , want answer question clinical study ( randomize control trial , RCT ) University Hospital Basel Cantonal Hospital Aarau . We plan investigate two administration strategy accord time SAP . Strategy A consist SAP application anesthetic room locate front actual operating theatre , patient get anesthesia . Therefore , application SAP take place early , approximately 75 30 minute prior skin incision . In strategy B apply SAP operate theatre , average occurs later ( approximately within last 30 minute skin incision ) . We test hypothesis strategy A effective preventing SSI strategy B . We include total 5000 patient abdominal , vascular trauma surgery ( 2500 study site 2500 per study group ) . All patient follow hospital SSI occurrence . Additionally , patient interview telephone hospital discharge define follow-up period 30 day ( 1 year implant place , hip endoprosthesis mesh ) . We expect study complete within approximately 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Additionally , association follow pre-defined variable occurence SSI , mortality , morbidity length hospital stay ( LOS ) investigate : - laparoscopy - tutorial assistance operation - obesity ( Body Mass Index , BMI ) - preoperative Virtual Reality ( VR ) train - Adherence Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) concept - smoking status - perioperative blood glucose level - preoperative level HbA1c - intensified insulin resistance measure Homeostasis Model Assessment ( HOMA ) quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index ( QUICKI ) - type diabetes ( IDDM vs. NIDDM ) - intraoperative Hypothermia ( body core temperature ) - Lack adherence principle asepsis surgery - surgical experience - patient age - Malnutrition , measure Hypalbuminaemia - emergency operation - immunosuppression steroid - Predictive value Procalcitonin - American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) classification - intraoperative blood transfusion - preoperative wound class Amendments : The following change make study protocol accord amendment approve local ethic committee : - As April 22nd , 2013 , 222. patient randomize University Hospital Basel , time SAP infusion STARTED record instead time ENDED . The decision change important parameter take order make result trial comparable publish study . - In original study protocol plan provide randomize patient patient 's diary record sign SSI . This abandon limited benefit order minimize patient ' time effort . - Patients undergo combine surgery ( one participate surgical specialty plus non participate specialty ) shall include trial outcome ( SSI ) could difficult correlate one another part surgery . This specified exclusion criterion original study protocol . - Patients ' information sheet inform consent one languages German approve local ethic committee May 15th , 2013 . - As per ethic committee regulation , patient include one clinical trial specific circumstance . Therefore limited percentage patient already include study still include trial . However , overall , excludes limit number potentially includable patient . The following additional amendment authorize ethic committee August 9th , 2014 : - Version 4 patient ' information write consent form . In new version , patient specifically ask permission review general practitioner ' note concern potential SSI , plan follow well case readmission hospital . This specify study protocol , specifically mention patient ' information consent form . This change also intend significantly decrease number patient lose follow prove difficult contact patient telephone .</detailed_description>
