	<brief_title>A Phase 1b/2 Study PLX3397 + Radiation Therapy + Temozolomide Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study drug administer twice daily 7 day prior initiation RT ( radiation therapy ) continue twice daily course RT . The RT schedule daily 5 day per week 6 week ( total radiation dose 60 Gy . Oral temozolomide administer daily ( 7 day per week ) duration RT . Four week completion course RT , patient start once-daily adjuvant temozolomide ( Day 1-5 28 day cycle ) PLX3397 twice daily ( 28 day 28 day cycle ) 12 cycle absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity . After discontinuation study drug , patient continue follow OS every 6 month . For patient participate run-in Phase 1b study , intra patient dose escalation permit RP2D establish . The Phase 2 portion study enroll patient treat PLX3397 RP2D . For Phase 1b portion study , 2 cohort ( 800 mg/day 1000 mg/day ) plan enrol approximately 7-10 site . Each cohort consist approximately 7 patient . Therefore , minimum 14 patient plan enrolled Phase 1b . Additional patient may require replacement patient , low dose cohort ( 600 mg 400 mg ) require . For Phase 2 portion study , enrollment plan include approximately 44 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient ≥18 year old . Histologically confirm definitive GBM gliosarcoma partial complete surgical resection ( i.e . biopsy ) within 5 week prior PLX3397 administration ( C1D1 ) . Tumor must supratentorial component . For patient , availability surgical paraffin tumor block sufficient generate least 20 unstained slide ; , paraffin tumor block unavailable , least 20 unstained slide . The patient must recover effect surgery , postoperative infection , complication study registration . A diagnostic contrastenhanced MRI CT scan brain must perform preoperatively postoperatively prior initiation radiotherapy , within 28 day ( preferably 14 day ) prior C1D1 . Patients unable undergo MR image noncompatible device enrol , provide pre postoperative contrastenhanced CT scan obtain sufficient quality . Patients must receive RT participate institution . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day initiation dosing must agree use acceptable method birth control study drug 3 month last dose . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥1 year . Men childbearing potential must also agree use acceptable method birth control study drug , 3 month last dose . Karnofsky performance status ≥70 . Adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function ( absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5x 109/L , Hgb &gt; 10 g/dL , platelet count ≥100 x 109/L , AST/ALT ≤2.5x ULN , creatinine ≤1.5x ULN ) . Willing able provide write informed consent prior study related procedure comply study requirement . Evidence recurrent GBM metastasis detect outside cranial vault . Investigational drug use within 28 day first dose PLX3397 concurrently . Prior use Gliadel wafer intratumoral intracavitary treatment . Prior radiation chemotherapy glioblastoma glioma . Prior chemotherapy radiosensitizers cancer head neck ( except T1 glottic cancer ) would result overlap radiation field . Prior allergic reaction temozolomide . History Grade 2 ( CTCAE v4 ) great acute intracranial hemorrhage . Active cancer ( either concurrent within last 3 year ) require nonsurgical therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy radiation therapy ) , exception surgically treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , melanoma insitu , carcinoma insitu cervix . Chronic active hepatitis B C. Refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption , biliary shunt , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption study drug . Patients serious illness , uncontrolled infection , medical condition , medical history include abnormal laboratory result , investigator 's opinion would likely interfere patient 's participation study , interpretation result . Women childbearing potential pregnant breast feeding . At Screening QTcF ≥450 msec male ≥470 msec female .</criteria>
