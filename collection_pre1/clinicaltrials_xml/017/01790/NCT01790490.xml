	<brief_summary>Cocaine dependence involve problematic neuroadaptations , heighten reactivity cocaine cue , may responsive pharmacological modulation glutamatergic circuit . Despite promising preclinical finding n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor ( NMDAr ) modulators , study human subject unsuccessful date . The purpose investigation examine effect NMDAr antagonist ketamine , recently find potent therapeutic effect human , cue-induced craving impaired motivation quit cocaine cocaine dependent participant , 24-hours post-infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glutamatergic Modulation Cocaine-related Deficits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , volunteer undergo 9 day inpatient trial receive three counter-balanced infusion ( two dos ketamine dose lorazepam ) three separate day within-subject , double-blind , controlled design . Of various glutamate antagonist available human use , ketamine utilized safety profile , pharmacokinetics , range tolerable sub-anesthetic dosings well study . Also , ketamine show promise manage opiate alcohol use disorder certain study , may therefore likely glutamate antagonist dampen cue reactivity increase motivation cocaine user . If ketamine significantly improve deficit , would suggest drug investigate potential utility treatment cocaine dependence .</detailed_description>
