	<brief_summary>Chronic Ankle Instability ( CAI ) health condition result repeat ankle sprain residual impairment . CAI link many different causative factor include sensory motor deficit affect global function sensorimotor system well patient . Over past 20 year , strong evidence generate support balance training effective intervention strategy CAI population . Unfortunately , investigation focus solely maximize motor output balance training , ignore full spectrum sensorimotor dysfunction associate CAI . There may advantageous sensory-targeted intervention augment effect balance train lead great enhancement functional outcome CAI . However , possibility systematically explore . Sensory-targeted ankle rehabilitation strategy ( STARS ) , joint mobilization plantar massage result improved sensorimotor function CAI . However , single STARS ( i.e . stochastic resonance ) investigate combination balance training . While combined effect great balance training alone , stochastic resonance require relatively expensive equipment commercially available . Thus , purpose investigation test hypothesis combine low cost STARS ( e.g . plantar massage joint mobilization ) balance training result great sensorimotor functional improvement CAI balance train alone .</brief_summary>
