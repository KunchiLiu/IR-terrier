	<detailed_description>Background . Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) one prevalent psychiatric disorder lead cause disability worldwide . Existing therapy fail produce complete recovery . Progress toward improve outcome must include innovation safe , powerful , inexpensive simple ( fast effective dissemination ) . The propose research seek test one innovation . We seek improve outcome improve memory content cognitive therapy ( CT ) session . CT one promising approach treatment MDD , yet room improvement . We believe add memory enhance strategy CT may improve MDD outcome : ( ) MDD often characterize memory impairment , ( b ) evidence memory impairment modifiable , ( c ) CT typically entail activation emotion , ( ) emotion impair bias memory ( e ) evidence memory content therapy session poor . Aim . To evaluate strategy design enhance memory content CT session improve treatment outcome MDD . Cognitive support involve series specific procedures support encode retrieval stage episodic memory . It hypothesize CT+Cognitive Support , relative CT-as-usual , associate improved depression outcome end treatment 6 month completion treatment . Research Plan . A small pilot feasibility RCT conduct adult MDD ( n = 48 ) randomize one two group : ( ) CT+Cognitive Support ( n = 24 ) ( b ) CT-as-usual ( n = 24 ) . Outcome measure take baseline , end treatment , 6 month treatment . Long-term objective . To provide pilot data need prepare large scale intervention study focus improve outcomes improve memory content therapy session . The outcome , positive , major public health implication simple , inexpensive memory enhance strategy readily include standard feature psychosocial treatment broad range mental illness .
