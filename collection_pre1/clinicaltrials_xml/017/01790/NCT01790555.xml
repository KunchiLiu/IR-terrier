	<brief_title>Perioperative Δ9-THC Postsurgical Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Early postsurgical pain consequence tissue trauma surgery , lead hyperalgesia allodynia . Adequate management postsurgical pain lead early mobilization , shorten hospital stay , reduce cost , increase patient satisfaction . Treatment usually involve use opioids , many side effect . Besides problem acute surgical pain , surgery may lead development persistent postsurgical pain . Based preclinical research , hypothesize Δ9-THC may improve outcome early postsurgical pain due pain modulatory effect may lower incidence persistent postsurgical pain modulation central pain processing , e.g . reduction central sensitization . From clinical study , evidence value Δ9-THC context , date , scarce . Indeed , research patient group major nociceptive load - i.e . major abdominal surgery - extended perioperative treatment schedule perform far . Both major nociceptive load extend perioperative treatment schedule necessary adequate assessment analgesic efficacy Δ9-THC context . Thus , question regard perioperative analgesic efficacy Δ9-THC major abdominal surgery remain unresolved . Objectives : The primary aim study investigate analgesic effect perioperatively administer Namisol® reduce postsurgical pain day major abdominal surgery first five day major abdominal surgery . A secondary aim investigate effect perioperatively administer Namisol® incidence persistent postsurgical pain first 12 postoperative week . Study design : A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study design perioperative add-on treatment Namisol placebo follow-up period 24 week . Study population : Forty patient recruited outpatient clinic department surgery Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center . Patients persistent intermittent abdominal pain , due underlie intra-abdominal pathology include diverticulitis , Crohn 's disease , chronic pancreatitis , ulcerative colitis , endometriosis , abdominal adhesion . Other intra-abdominal pathology may include cause pain judge appropriate investigator . Patients plan undergo elective , open abdominal surgery plan use epidural catheter perioperative analgesia . The surgical procedure estimate duration least two hour , exclude time induce anesthesia . Intervention : Namisol® , tablet standardize Δ9-THC content , identical match placebo administer orally evaluate analgesic property Namisol® administer add-on perioperative treatment . The study medication give day surgery ( day -1 : 5 mg afternoon even ) fifth day surgery ( day 0 +5 : 5 mg four time daily ) . Primary secondary study parameter : The primary study outcome postsurgical pain intensity first five postoperative day , reflect primary endpoint : area curve VAS score first five day ( AUC5days ) surgery . The secondary outcome incidence persistent postsurgical pain 12 week surgery . Other study parameter : In addition primary secondary outcome , several outcome parameter collect . These include measure postsurgical pain intensity 24 week surgery , measure analgesic efficacy ( postoperative consumption analgesic ) , central nervous system process sensitization first 5 day 6 12 week surgery ( QST , Von Frey test , brush stroke test ) , postoperative sedation level ( Ramsay Scale ) , immune system response 72 hour surgery 6 week ( ILs , MMPs ) investigate . In addition , questionnaire fill examine parameter related side effect postoperative recovery ( VAS Bond &amp; Lader , VAS Bowdle , HADS , SF-36 , PCS , PASS , QoR-40 , AppLe , TSQM ) . Two variant genetic CYP2C9 polymorphism genotyped three variant genetic CYP2C19 polymorphism genotyped . Nature extent burden , risk , benefit : Participation mean three four visit outpatient clinic addition usual care , include screen visit . Various measurement , include blood sample ( seven additional sample entire study period ) , conduct visit . The participate patient may experience good pain relief postoperative period may benefit reduced incidence persistent postsurgical pain , subject intense diagnostics observation .</detailed_description>
