	<brief_summary>This protocol , UMCC 2012.047 , pilot study initially intend 12 subject . After complete enrollment plan 12 subject , extend study additional 25 subject . The trial examine safety efficacy addition vorinostat , study drug , standard medication try prevent low risk graft versus-host disease ( GVHD ) recipient unrelated ( match ) donor , blood marrow stem cell transplant . The transplant regimens , choose accord current institutional policy , depend upon recipient 's underlying disease ( blood cancer blood disorder ) , previous therapy , current health issue . GVHD prophylaxis ( preventive drug intervention ) local institutional standard post-transplant immunosuppression , include tacrolimus methotrexate , plus vorinostat . Vorinostat give twice daily orally begin 10 day prior recipient 's transplant continue 100 day transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Plus Tacrolimus &amp; Methotrexate Prevent Graft v Host Disease Following Unrelated Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial investigate use vorinostat ( Merck ) standard graft versus-host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) . A major limitation increase utilization allogeneic HCT ( Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation ) inferior outcomes donor HLA ( HumanLeukocyte Antigen ) -matched sibling use 1,2 . Compared match related donor , recipient match unrelated donor transplant significantly increase risk death transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) 3,4 . Acute GVHD remain significant contributor TRM , develop approximately 50-70 % recipient receive type graft despite standard immunosuppressive prophylaxis 5-8 . Thus , novel GVHD prophylaxis strategy successfully attenuate acute GVHD-related complication without increase cause TRM relapse need . The historical experience day 100 grade 2-4 acute GVHD 154 comparable patient treat University Michigan ( 2005 - 2011 ) receive standard GVHD prophylaxis unrelated donor allogeneic transplant 48 % . At Washington University , cumulative incidence acute grade 2-4 GVHD patient follow unrelated donor transplant 62 % . Research data collectively suggest , reduce lethal acute GVHD improve long-term survival patient undergo unrelated donor transplant .</detailed_description>
