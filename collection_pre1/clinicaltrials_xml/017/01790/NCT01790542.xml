In addition meeting iron need first solid food choice , investigator concern possible generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) gut infant feed traditional iron fortify cereal . Infant cereal fortify 25-30 mg iron per 100 g dry-weight . Absorption non-heme electrolytic iron range 5-10 % residual iron enters colon . Normally excess iron sequester variety mechanism body , system sequester iron gut lumen . The investigator show provide iron supplement adult majority iron unabsorbed pass digestive tract lead generation ROS colon . These effect see adult receive 1 mg/kg/day supplemental iron . By 5-6 month age infant consume iron fortify cereal receive dose likely produce ROS digestive tract . This may cause inflammation make infant susceptible disease . The investigator think meat infant cereal phenolic antioxidant available fruit likely reduce generation ROS vivo . Therefore investigator wish determine traditional newly recommend first food safe free radical inflammatory perspective . HYPOTHESES : 1 . Consumption infant cereal iron increase ROS generation gut 2 . Consumption infant cereal iron fruit decrease ROS gut 3 . Consumption meat generate ROS 4 .
