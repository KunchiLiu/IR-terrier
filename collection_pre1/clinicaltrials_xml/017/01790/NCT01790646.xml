	<detailed_description>Glidescope® Videolaryngoscope angulate rigid optical device introduce clinical practice 2004 facilitate endotracheal intubation . Since introduction potential benefit instrument might lie use patient clinical feature indicate difficult laryngoscopy use rescue method follow fail direct laryngoscopy . In center propose use routinely . The performance Glidescope® study easy difficult scenario , vivo manikin compare reference standard McIntosh direct laryngoscopy . In patient predict simulated difficult intubation , despite glottis visualization improve Glidescope® , introduction tube trachea difficult McIntosh laryngoscopy . Training operator entertain trial vary 20 50 Glidescope successful intubation . In observational study Aziz et al . demonstrate two Institutions involve GlideScope® use frequently Institution failure rate significantly low . At , 51 provider perform mean 21.7 GlideScope® intubation 91 provider perform 9.9 intubation . These data highlight important issue many Glidescope® intubation provider complete reach definitive clinical competence practice . Until one study perform mankin compare Glidescope® AirTraq® McIntosh laryngoscopes novice . The author conclude despite steep learn curve 5 intubation difficulty instrumentation longer time intubate persist Glidescope® comparison two device . Outcome measure : duration intubation attempt , modify Cormack grade , dental trauma difficulty use . In vivo timely insertion laryngoscope blade introduction tube , need help external laryngeal displacement include ascertain expertise new technology patient different grade difficulty predict .</detailed_description>
