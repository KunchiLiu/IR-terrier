	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Denervation Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) final stage various heart diseases global grow public health problem , morbidity increase age . At present , main therapy CHF contain drug therapy ( include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , aldosterone antagonist , beta-receptor blocker , diuretic , digoxin etc ) , CRT-D ( cardiac resynchronization therapy ) /ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ) , biological treatment , ultrafiltration dialysis , heart transplantation . Optimize drug therapy foundation CHF , hypotension bradycardia limit indication . ESC ( European Society Cardiology ) /AHA ( American Heart Association ) guideline recommend CRT-P/D ICD drug resistant CHF , financial burden limit use patient response . Donors high cost consider two problem limit heart transplantation appeal . Above , always search new treatment strategy patient chronic heart failure . Chronic over-activation sympathetic nervous system major component heart failure involve efferent afferent pathway brain many organ . Recently , study animal human suggest activation efferent afferent renal nerve play crucial role pathogenesis progression CHF . Activation renal nerve CHF may cause reflex increase sympathetic tone contributes elevate peripheral vascular resistance vascular remodel well left ventricular remodel dysfunction . Recently , many clinical trial corroborate catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation ( RSD ) significantly decrease sympathetic-nerve activity ( MSNA ) muscle whole-body , decrease renal whole-body norepinephrine spillover . Simultaneously , many clinical research also verify RSD safely use control hypertension , reduce leave ventricular hypertrophy , improve glucose tolerance impair , decrease proteinuria sleep apnea severity , recognize independent risk factor development progression CHF . Therefore , randomize parallel control clinical trial design demonstrate whether RSD slow progression CHF reduce rate all-cause mortality effectively securely .</detailed_description>
