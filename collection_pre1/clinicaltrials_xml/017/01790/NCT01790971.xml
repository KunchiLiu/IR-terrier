	<brief_summary>Patients Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) appear especially vulnerable medication suppress pharyngeal muscle activity general anesthetic opioids . Opioids depress ventilator response airway obstruction inhibit awaken response hypoxia hypercarbia , result central respiratory depression . OSA therefore important risk factor serious postoperative complication , include perioperative death . While OSA increasingly recognize serious perioperative concern , current clinical practice highly inconsistent regard management surgical patient OSA . Additionally , relative safety intrathecal opioids patient population remain unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Total hip knee arthroplasty ( THA TKA ) among common orthopedic procedure perform worldwide1 . They show reduce chronic pain , increase ability function independently , improve quality life2,3 . With age increasingly obese North American population , use THA TKA increase 4 . One main challenge associate THA well TKA continue perioperative management patient elderly obese , associated co-morbidities . Both THA TKA commonly perform neuraxial anesthesia . Neuraxial anesthesia report provide multiple benefit compare general anesthesia and/or systemic analgesia include superior post-operative analgesia5 , reduce opioid consumption6 , improve rehabilitation7 , reduce morbidity mortality8-12 . The addition opioids neuraxial local anesthetic solution common practice since 1979 , morphine first show provide effective prolonged analgesia intrathecal administration13 . For THA TKA surgery , intrathecal morphine provide effective analgesia14-16 allow reduction dose intrathecal local anesthetic ( thus minimize side effect ) 17 , mark postoperative opioid-sparing effect14-16 . However , benefit intrathecal morphine must weigh risk pruritis , nausea/vomiting , urinary retention , , concern , respiratory depression18 .</detailed_description>
