	<brief_title>Oral Iohexol Fecal/Fluid Tagging CT Colonography : A Study Improve Image Quality Preventing Colonic Bubbles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT colonography ( CTC ) recently develop radiological examination find colorectal neoplasia . Fecal/fluid tag use oral administration contrast essential procedure CTC . Iohexol , recently start used agent fecal/fluid tagging , great advantage much tolerable taste much low rate adverse effect clamp diarrhea compare traditionally use Gastrografin/Gastroview . However , iohexol frequently associate occurrence lot bubble colon , make CTC interpretation time-consuming laborious . Past experience colonoscopy field suggest simethicone , safety-proven highly inexpensive over-the-counter medicine , might resolve issue . Given fact patient convenience important factor successful CTC fact time-intensive nature CTC interpretation one major deterrent wide spread adoption CTC CTC also need time efficient possible order effectively serve role population screen colorectal cancer , investigate effect simethicone prevent colonic bubble time efficiency CTC interpretation would important . If simethicone resolve colonic bubble problem , CTC perform conveniently patient well interpret radiologist . This study determine whether colonic bubble associate CT colonography perform iohexol fecal/fluid tagging could reduce add simethicone standard cathartic preparation .</detailed_description>
