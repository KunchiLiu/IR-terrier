	<brief_title>Laser Intervention Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LEAD patient assessor mask , multi-centre randomize controlled exploratory medical device clinical investigation 240 participant ( 1:1 active shame laser procedure ) design assess effectiveness nanosecond laser treatment patient early high-risk AMD . No le 240 participant randomize either active laser treatment sham laser procedure group ratio 1:1 . Patient eligibility base ocular inclusion criterion evaluate use measure vision , fundus photography , OCT imaging , macular integrity ( MAIA ) perform qualifying period . Fundus image MAIA result send coordinate centre review confirm eligibility base lesion attribute criterion specify protocol . Following confirmation eligibility coordinate centre , participant satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion randomize . Allocation treatment group stratify smoking status . All participant receive either active laser treatment sham laser procedure treatment visit assess retreatment semi-annual basis . All participant contact telephone 1 week present clinical examination visit 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males females 50 95 year age time consent Best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) 6/12 ( 20/40 ) good eye . Bilateral highrisk early AMD : At least one druse ≥125um within inner macular zone ( circle radius 1500 micron centre fovea ) without pigment . A MAIA static threshold sensitivity le 25 dB point , within customize grid , measure use Macular Integrity Assessment ( MAIA ) device ) , location one eye two separate occasion . Pupil dilation least 5 mm eye Fundus photograph , OCT FAF image adequate quality assess LEAD Image Reading Centre . Ability willingness consent , randomize , 2RT active sham laser treatment , qualification followup phase study . Any evidence definite geographic atrophy within macula ( circle radius 3000 micron centre fovea ) . Any black ( hypofluorescent ) area FAF consistent GA ( roughly round oval shape , sharp margin ) , corroborate colour photography patch hypopigmentation . Any evidence 'preclinical atrophy ' determined OCT : loss outer retina ( RPE photoreceptors cube scan ( Spectralis OCT ) ( 49 horizontal B scan , 120 µm apart 20 x 20 degree scan ) . This cover approximately 6 x 6 mm emmetropic eye ( N.B. , peripapillary atrophy ( PPA ) 1500 micron fovea allow ) . Current CNV , past evidence CNV either eye . Any experimental treatment AMD , exclude dietary supplement , receive past 12 month think likely chronically change course participant 's retinal disease . Any OCT showing evidence intraretinal fluid , subretinal fluid CNV exclude cause . A subfoveal pigment epithelial detachment/drusenoid detachment great 1000 micron diameter . Other macular disease subretinal deposit typical AMD , e.g. , Malattia Leventinese , Sorsby fundus dystrophy , Alports syndrome Ocular disease either eye , AMD , significantly compromise ability treat visualize fundus would compromise ability assess effect follow laser application include ; Known allergic hypersensitivity fluorescein . Previous retinal ocular surgical procedure , effect may future complicate assessment progression AMD . Requirement systemic ocular medication know toxic retina , : Deferoxamine , Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil ) , Chlorpromazine , Phenothiazines , Ethambutol Any serious systemic disease preclude 3 year survival regular attendance follow . Sensitivity contact lens application . Any condition would make adherence examination schedule 3 year difficult unlikely . Any history prior laser surgery retina . Intraocular pressure 26mm Hg high reason believe participant may glaucoma Significant cataract : Nuclear cataract grade 2 3 , cortical cataract Grade 2 3 posterior subcapsular cataract Grade 2 3 , Simplified Cataract Grading System ( WHO Cataract Grading Group ) .</criteria>
