	<brief_summary>This prospective , single center , investigator initiate , randomize control trial compare two method perform colonoscopy experience colonoscopist . Potential female subject present colonoscopy UCD GI Lab present study option enrol sign inform consent . In recent year , water infusion method report several beneficial effect study veteran patient . These include : significant reduction discomfort permit significantly high percentage ( 98 % vs. 76 % ) veterans complete schedule unsedated colonoscopy , low sedation medication requirement accept option minimal pre-medication sedation , patient complete without sedation ( 78 % vs 54 % ) accept demand sedation increase yield adenomas ( type cancer see colon ) screen surveillance colonoscopy . Reviewers method repeatedly call study use method female patient confirm refute finding veteran patient male patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Water vs. Air Method Performing Colonoscopy Adult Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Aim Our aim perform randomize control trial compare air insufflation colonoscopy ( conventional method ) vs. water infusion colonoscopy ( study method ) non veteran female subject present colonoscopy . Subjects randomize 1:1 like flip coin . Study Design This prospective , single center , investigator initiate , randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare study method ( water infusion colonoscopy ) conventional method ( air insufflation colonoscopy `` pump air dilate colon visualize colon mucosa ) female patient experienced colonoscopist . Patients classify ASA 1 ( No organic , physiologic , biomedical psychiatric disturbance ) ASA 2 ( Mild moderate systemic disease well control include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , asthma , age 70 ) colonoscopy procedure . Research Methods Procedures The air ( conventional ) method : Air pump gently ( insufflation ) colon use open inside space colon aid colonoscope insertion The water ( study ) method : Warm water ( body temperature ) pump colon place air open inside space colon aid colonoscope insertion After insertion , method may use follow procedure advance colonoscope colon : colonoscope shorten maneuver , abdominal compression , assistant , change patient position . In method air insufflation use distend colon inspection , biopsy polypectomy . Washing stool cover mucosa inspection behind fold perform systematically . After turn around rectum , residual air water remove suction . Data gathering instrument use VA study employ ( subject interview question attach ) . Statistical analysis similar use previous VA study ( Student 's test , Fischer 's exact test , Mann-Whitney U test , etc ) use analyze data . Biopsy polypectomy perform usual tissue submit routine histological assessment pathology record .</detailed_description>
