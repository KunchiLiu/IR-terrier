	<brief_summary>The purpose study find drug NULOJIX速 ( belatacept ) minimize amount anti-rejection medication necessary thereby reduce long-term side effect cause medication . The researcher also want learn safety treatment long term health transplant pancreas kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization NULOJIX速 Usage Towards Minimizing CNI Exposure Simultaneous Pancreas Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transplant recipient take anti-rejection medication prevent immune system ( body 's natural defense system illness ) reject new organ . Most patient receive transplant organ must take anti-rejection medication rest life , long transplant organ continue work . Taking standard anti-rejection medication long time cause serious side effect , include pancreas kidney damage . There would benefit find new anti-rejection medication work well , could lessen amount anti-rejection medication take long term .</detailed_description>
