	<brief_summary>This single-center , feasibility study involve neonate admit neonatal intensive care unit order cardiac echo evaluation . Parents approach provide description study . No write consent request , parent option opt . Each patient 5 minute Pocket echocardiography system scan follow full echo perform traditional full feature echo system . The objective ass current Food Drug administration ( FDA ) approve Pocket echocardiography system ( PES ) detect patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) neonates comparable traditional full feature echo system ( FFES ) and/or physical exam alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pocket Echocardiography System ( PES ) Detection PDA Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All newborn admit neonatal intensive care unit order cardiac echo evaluation include study . Parents approach provide description study . No write consent request , parent option opt . If parent agree part study , 5-minute PES scan perform first bias sonographer . Then , full echocardiogram study perform traditional FFES . The scan perform bedside . The image review compare fellow and/or attend experience sonographer . The scan include short axis view , ductal view arch view . The objective study assess current FDA approve PES detect PDA neonate comparable traditional full feature echo system and/or physical exam alone . Using PES PDA diagnosis accessible , economic effective way complement finding physical exam increase diagnostic accuracy , detect PDA 's bedside comparable full size traditional echocardiographic system .</detailed_description>
