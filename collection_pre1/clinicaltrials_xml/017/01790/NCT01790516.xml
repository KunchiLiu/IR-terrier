	<brief_summary>This study patient newly diagnose head neck cancer remove surgery . The purpose study determine feasibility use genetic variation patient select right drug treat head neck cancer . Cisplatin cetuximab ( Erbitux ) approve FDA treat head neck cancer combination radiation therapy . In study investigator test whether genetic difference patient use pick two drug patient receive . All patient blood sample drawn test genetic difference . If patient genetic difference correlate good outcome cisplatin receive cisplatin radiation . If patient genetic difference correlate good outcome cisplatin receive cetuximab radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment-naive patient locally advanced , non-metastatic ( Stage III IVB ) squamous cell carcinoma head neck candidate concurrent chemoradiotherapy primary therapy curative intent enrol . Patients genotyped germline variation four SNP loci three gene involve DNA nucleotide excision repair ( ERCC1 , ERCC2 , XRCC1 ) . Patients 3 8 variant receive cisplatin ( Arm A ) . Patients 2 few variant receive cetuximab ( Arm B ) . The hypothesis study prospectively test patient variation DNA repair enzyme determine whether use cisplatin cetuximab locally advanced head neck squamous cell cancer feasible .</detailed_description>
