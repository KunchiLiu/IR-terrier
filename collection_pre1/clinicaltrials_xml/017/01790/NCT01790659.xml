	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study Walter Reed ( WR ) 279,396 Paromomycin Alone Treatment Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Panama</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit three region Panama know endemic L panamensis CL . Subjects screen period 28 day eligibility include medical history , physical examination , leishmaniasis history , vital sign , clinical chemistry , prior medication , parasitology confirmation ulcerative CL . If eligible , subject randomize targeted 1:1 ratio ( 200 subject per group ) use site stratification variable receive either WR 279,396 ( 15 % paromomycin + 0.5 % gentamicin topical cream ) Paromomycin Alone ( 15 % paromomycin topical cream ) topical application CL lesion daily 20 day . Efficacy assess measure size index lesion ulcer , non-index lesion ulcer , overall size non-ulcerated lesion baseline ( start treatment ) , Study Days 20 , 35 ± 2 day , 49 ± 4 day , 63 ± 7 day , 100 ± 14 day , 168 ± 14 day . A notation make clinical evidence parasite persistence observe Day 63 beyond visit include significant erythema induration lesion otherwise completely re-epithelialized document subject remove study early investigator judge need rescue treatment . A photograph take lesion baseline , Day 20 follow-up visit . Safety assess monitor adverse event ( AEs ) start treatment study completion , lesion site reaction treatment , physical examination nasal oral mucosa appearance mucosal leishmaniasis Days 63 ± 7 day , 100 ± 14 day , 168 ± 14 day , concomitant medication use duration study , blood creatinine , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) level Study Day 20 . After sponsor 's approval , biochemistry repeat case abnormal result cause result could determine . A repeat pregnancy test Day 35 . Recent infection leishmaniasis prior start study may result development lesion present start study receive treatment . New lesion may treat discretion investigator topical cream subject assign time conduct study except treatment must complete Day 168 visit . If new lesion discover final study visit , subject refer primary physician treatment . Subjects fail therapy ( see definition failure ) take study may administer rescue therapy discretion subject 's personal physician . If subject meet criterion therapy failure undergo treatment new lesion , subject continue study ( sign consent addendum ) investigator decide best interest subject .</detailed_description>
