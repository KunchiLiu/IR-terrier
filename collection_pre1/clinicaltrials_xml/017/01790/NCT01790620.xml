	<brief_summary>Severe septic patient acute kidney injury ( AKI ) require continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) present high mortality due systemic inflammatory response , cytokine liberation , finally multiorgan dysfunction . Cytokine plasmatic elimination continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) present frequent complication , know `` dialytrauma '' , high resource cost technical human . The study primary end-point demonstrate non-inferiority survival continuous venovenous hemodialysis ( CVVHD ) plus adsorption membrane respect CVVH plus adsorption membrane . As secondary end-points investigator try demonstrate immunomodulation technical superiority CVVHD respect CVVH . In order achieve objective investigator design randomize control trial include patient present severe sepsis AKI meeting CRRT initiation criterion . During first 72 hour investigator measure plasmatic elimination capacity main cytokine , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , clinical prognostic relevant molecule . Investigators also measure hemodynamic , respiratory , metabolic parameter . Adverse effect relate CRRT ( `` dialytrauma '' ) also registrated . Finally , investigator analyze 90 day survival . Demonstration non inferiority survival add superior immunomodulating capacity minor complication rate consequent low cost , settle base evidence principle recommend use CVVHD asociated adsorption membrane severe septic patient AKI need CRRT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators warrant correct protocol application . Study data review external monitoring committee clinical assay research central unit ( UCICEC - IDIBELL ) . Monitors contrast register data collection data form ( CDF ) data patient´s medical record . All patient´s medical record indefinitely save electronical format review necessary . Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize one arm aleatory assignation use randomisation sequential ( RndSeq ) program Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) . Adverse event report ( less 24 hour severe ) sponsor center properly evaluate . If severe adverse event ( SAE ) finally evaluate study board relate intervention arm , urgent notification health authority must proceed study interrupted decision . Sample size assessment calculate provide power 80 % significance level 0.05 detect non inferiority survival 90 day . Assuming severe sepsis and/or septic shock 50 % survival community , investigator determine 100 patient population size , 50 patient arm , would enough demonstrate primary outcome measure . Missing data try avoid exhaustive patient´s follow study investigator . Intention treat analysis ( ITT ) main strategy statistical substitution technique miss data apply necessary . Per protocol analysis also do avoid possible bias non inferiority study . Out-of-range result identify processed adequate statistical technique . Data registry create include variable write individual data collection form ( DCF ) . Data bedside register study member final software database registration do statistic outside investigator contact patient situation . Cytokines LPS level introduce DCF measure ( every six month ) . Statistical analysis do statistic investigator wont role patient´s selection , randomization , follow . SPSS v. 18.0 statistical analysis use . Variable distribution study logarithmic transformation use variable n't present normal distribution , presumably cytokine LPS level . Univariate analysis compare clinical , demographic , biochemical , metabolic , hemodynamic respiratory baseline variable arm ( CVVHD-ST150 CVVH-ST150 ) , do two-tailed test continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . Variables determine several time ( T0 , T24 , T48 , T72 ) analyse use one-way repeat measure ANOVA test order demonstrate difference arm . Multivariate analysis complete control clinically relevant confounding variable well discover baseline difference . According hypothesis dependent variable study investigator use survival analysis ( study mortality ) cox regression model , hierarchic multiple linear regression model dependent variable continuous ( example dialytrauma score ) . Arm intervention ( CVVHD , CVVH ) consider main independent variable add control independent variable . As study measure cytokine LPS level five different moment ( T0 , T24 , T48 , T72 ) , order maximize statistical power reduce control variable number , area curve ( AUC ) we´ll determine every cytokine LPS first 72 hour . Due statistical maneuver investigator obtain continuous variable represent cytokine-LPS level biochemical study period ( 72 hour ) . To evaluate arm intervention improvement term efficacy safety could relate cytokine and/or LPS level first 72 hour , mediation complementary analysis do consider cytokine-LPS ( represent AUC ) mediator independent variable ( intervention arm ) effect study .
