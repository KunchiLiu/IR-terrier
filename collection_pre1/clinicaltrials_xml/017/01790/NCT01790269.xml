	<brief_title>Monitoring Natural Killer Cells Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated With Fingolimod</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past decade , become evident natural killer ( NK ) cell simply killer seem involve regulation autoimmune condition Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . Yet , complexity NK cell activation maturation understood . Several recent publication report marker characterize different stage human NK cell maturation/ differentiation , include CD27 , CD62L , CD94 CD57 . In recent study , investigator demonstrate chemokine receptor CX3CR1 represent additional marker NK cell , conjunction novel marker , serf delineate sequential stage human NK cell differentiation . CX3CR1 suggest essential protective effect NK cell animal model MS . In context , investigator previously report correlation frequency circulate CX3CR1-positive NK cell disease activity patient MS . Moreover , unpublished data indicate association genetic variation NK cell-related gene response IFN-beta treatment . Thus , appear NK cell ( least certain NK cell fraction ) may protective MS also mediators therapeutic benefit . Fingolimod ( GILENYA® ) modulator sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor ( S1P-receptors ) indicate treatment patient relapse form MS reduce frequency clinical relapse . Gilenya® license Germany since April 2011 escalation therapy patient highly active RRMS . Data fingolimod effect NK cell far conflict . A longitudinal study fingolimod treat kidney transplant patient show NK cell influence treatment group . However , recent report indicate increase frequency NK cell peripheral blood CSF MS patient treat fingolimod relative reduction immature CD56bright NK cell fingolimod-treated MS patient . However , latter study exclusively compare frequency NK cell untreated MS patient patient treat fingolimod , longitudinal intraindividual data treatment present . Moreover , two study consider potential diverse effect fingolimod different NK cell subpopulation . It demonstrate expression NK cell relevant sphingosine 1-phosphate ( S1P ) receptor seem increase NK cell maturation . Thus , different NK cell sub-types may response differently S1P-receptor agonist fingolimod . Therefore , investigator aim investigate longitudinally ( baseline vs. treatment ) effect fingolimod NK cell maturation/differentiation .</detailed_description>
