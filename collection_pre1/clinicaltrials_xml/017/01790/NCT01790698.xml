	<brief_summary>This proposal focus highly lethal destructive tissue infection , i.e . necrotizing fasciitis necrotizing soft tissue infection ( NSTIs ) , associate high morbidity mortality . The fulminant course NSTIs demand immediate diagnosis adequate intervention order salvage live limb . However , diagnosis management difficult due heterogeneity clinical presentation , co-morbidities microbiological aetiology . Thus , urgent need novel diagnostics therapeutic order improve outcome NSTIs . A comprehensive knowledge diagnostic feature , causative microbial agent , treatment strategy , pathogenic mechanism ( host bacterial disease trait underlie interaction network ) require improved diagnosis management NSTIs . The current proposal design obtain insight integrate system biology approach patient experimental model . The project base prospective NSTI patient cohort include clinical registry document clinical data treatment strategy , combine isolate biobank collection . The sample analyze advanced bioinformatics computational modelling work flow identify quantify pathogen signature underlie network contribute disease outcome . One aim translate clinical system biology data development novel diagnostics .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systems Medicine Study Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections ( NSTIs ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients prospectively recruit 5 clinical center ( Rigshospitalet , Karolinska University Hospital , Blekinge University , Sahlgrenska University University Bergen ) . Clinical definition criterion NSTI : NSTI clinical diagnosis . Initial sign occurrence erythema , pain tenderness beyond margin erythema swell . Imaging laboratory test little predictive value early stage . The gold standard modality diagnosis NSTI remain operative exploration . Operative finding consistent NSTI include `` dishwater foul smell discharge , necrosis lack bleeding loss normal resistance fascia finger dissection . A patient admit critical care / surgery due severe soft tissue infection fascia , muscle subcutaneous tissue enrol NSTI study . The patient stratify base several clinical parameter include among others SAPS score , presence multiorgan failure , hypotensive shock . This stratification serve classify patient define severity class use analysis model . Detailed demographic clinical information document interactive database include : age , gender , medical history , clinical presentation ( shock , multiorgan failure etc ) , treatment outcome . Disease progress : The clinical database contain information spread infection different time inspection/surgical intervention . Severity infection document use updated CREST classification scheme , SAPS III score , LRINEC score . Detailed information regard antimicrobial therapy , surgical intervention , innovative therapy ( IVIG HBO ) document . Samples collect enrolled patient . Standard operate procedure generate implemented site ensure quality assure collection handle sample . Samples collect include ( ) isolate , ( b ) blood sample process DNA , RNA plasma/cells ( c ) tissue biopsy patient whenever surgical intervention indicate . The sample analyze use genomics , transcriptomics , metabolomics proteomics .</detailed_description>
