	<brief_summary>The study aim evaluate quality life ( QoL ) patient affected Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma ( POAG ) , use 2 QoL questionnaire : 1 . Glaucoma Symptom Scale ( GSS ) 2 . National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire ( NEI-VFQ -25 ) . The study conduct patient well know diagnosis POAG ( transversal phase ) patient first diagnosis POAG ( longitudinal phase ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study provide two level investigation , first one ( transversal phase ) , patient enrol participate center second one ( longitudinal phase ) conduct single cohort patient new diagnosis POAG enrollment . The study take part around 20 center specialized glaucoma treatment care , distribute throughout Italian country area . The study aim recruit total 3000 patient , around 200 early diagnosis : represent longitudinal cohort . The frequency visit type examination follow normal clinical practice . The transversal phase consist single visit socio-demographic clinical characteristic patient collect ; visit patient receive NEI-VFQ 25 GSS questionnaire measure QoL ( fill patient ) . For newly diagnose patient , data collect visit consider baseline , enter longitudinal phase underwent two subsequent visit , first one 6 month baseline second one 6 month ( 12 month baseline ) . During two subsequent visit data baseline collect , exclude socio-demographic data . Patients underwent examination therapy suitable disease treatment , base physician judgment accord normal clinical practice . All patient data collect Case Report Form ( CRF ) . All data contain CRF QoL questionnaire , enter electronic database check order ass plausibility , internal consistency , error miss value . For missing/loose/illegible/wrong data request clarification automatically generated system ; name `` Query Form '' send investigator answer . At end validation process , database `` frozen '' use statistical analysis . The data collect absolutely anonymous way . No data trace back patient personal information history . All patient enrol study , except inclusion/exclusion criterion violation , consider statistical analysis . The general characteristic study sample described . Qualitative variable describe mean absolute relative frequency calculation , quantitative mean , standard deviation , quartile , minimum , maximum , number observation . With regard QoL scale , total score subscale calculate . The approach use within subgroup define basis socio-demographic clinical characteristic . As per calculation sample size , estimate present Italy 500,000 patient affect glaucoma 50 center specialized disease treatment . A sample 3000 patient POAG involvement least 20 center specialized glaucoma treatment consider representative estimation reality Italian coutry area . With sample size least 3000 patient possible calculate 95 % confidence interval estimate value parameter collect inaccuracy exceed 3.6 % . It assume possible isolate 200 patient first diagnosis , time course QOL scale score describe entire cohort predetermine patient subgroup . For successful implementation procedure require study follow activity provide : - Start-up follow-up meeting , aim share operating procedure , train investigator use study tool collection data following-up study issue ; - Project dedicate Help Desk . This study conduct accord AIFA March 20 , 2008 , `` Guidelines classification management observational study drug '' principle express guideline 'Good Epidemiology Practice ' ( GEP ) force Europe . A patient 's informed consent consent processing data , sign patient , obtain study entry .</detailed_description>
