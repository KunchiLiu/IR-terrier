	<brief_summary>Arterial cannulation commonly perform invasive procedure operation room , emergency department , intensive care unit . The indication include need continuous blood-pressure monitoring , frequent arterial blood-gas analysis , repeat blood sample laboratory evaluation . This procedure challenge even best hand . Traditionally , artery locate feeling pulse patient . The pulse may , however weak absent patient hypotension , edema , obesity local thrombosis due previous arterial cannulation location . Furthermore , catheter may pass successfully artery , despite apparent good blood return initial puncture , hematoma spasm artery may develop fail attempt , thus make attempt even difficult . While ultrasound ( US ) use increase frequency central venous access , few clinician familiar US-guided arterial catheterization . The aim study investigate ultrasound facilitates arterial cannulation child â‰¤24 month compare palpation method investigate potential extra costs/savings introduce method . This study hypothesize ultrasound method facilitate arterial cannulation small child compare palpation method .</brief_summary>
