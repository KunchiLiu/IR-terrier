	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis lenalidomide romidepsin ( dexamethasone patient myeloma ) acceptable toxicity profile combination sufficient activity target population ( include previously refractory HDACi monotherapy ) warrant investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label , International , Multi-centre , Phase I/IIa Study Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) Romidepsin ( Istodax ) Relapsed /Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma , Mature T-cell Lymphoma Multiple Myeloma . ( RId Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary rationale : 1 . As individual agent , histone deacetylase inhibitor lenalidomide significant activity disease study ; 2 . There potential agent synergize ( improve upon response rate overlap disparate mechanism action . ) Both agent may synergize induce cell death caspase 8-mediated mechanism ; induce p21 cell cycle arrest ; agent anti-angiogenic effect ; likely interfere PI3K/Akt signal . One particularly attractive aspect combination potential synergistic immunological effect , particularly relate T-cell polarization , NK cell activation , STAT signal cytokine production , discuss ; 3 . With respect PTCL , CTCL HL , clear path drug development registration trial prove safe efficacious combination ; 4 . Myeloma incurable due persistence drug-resistant sub-clone tumor-propagating cell drug insensitive . Preclinical data suggest HDACi lenalidomide may target tumor-propagating cell . This argue examine combination part early treatment disease . This trial first step examine feasibility combine HDACi front-line therapy myeloma USA - lenalidomide . 5 . Incorporating three separate arm ( opposed three separate study ) allow ; . The investigator accumulate data novel combination across three group evaluate toxicity profile make informed decision around dose-escalation . Because single study , valid comparison make across group , would possible separate study . ii . combine simplified collection correlative test across three study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient must biopsyproven diagnosis one follow malignancy meet additional diseasespecific inclusion criterion . A . Mature TCell lymphoma . The following entity eligible . PTCL CTCL ( include MF SS ) exclude adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma , primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoma , lymphomatoid papulosis , NK LGL leukemia . ( The complete WHO classification Tcell lymphoma find appendix ) . 1 . Peripheral Tcell lymphoma : patient must relapse progress : least one prior chemotherapybased treatment , suitable conventional chemotherapeutic approach judge investigator . 2 . Sezary syndrome/ Mycosis Fungoides : patient must relapse progress least one prior systemic therapy . B. Hodgkin lymphoma 1 . At least one prior chemotherapybased treatment . 2 . Prior autograft eligible autologous transplantation accord institutional guideline . C. Myeloma 1 . Relapsed least one prior systemic therapy include thalidomide ( unless intolerant contraindicate ) lenalidomide . Those received prior lenalidomide must response exceed 6 month . 2 . Patients candidate autologous stem cell transplant first remission eligible . 3 . Patients must failed/relapsed bortezomib therapy . 2 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 3 . Age &gt; 18 year . 4 .
