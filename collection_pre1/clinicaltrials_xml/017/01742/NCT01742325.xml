	<brief_title>The Effect Walking Intervention Sleep Related Symptom Distress Pediatric Oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>※ Background &amp; Significance : Symptom management major issue pediatric oncology patient parent . In clinical practice patient undergo cancer treatment seldom present single symptom , usually suffer multiple symptom simultaneously . However , discuss symptom distress child cancer , study mostly focus one ( single ) symptom . Fatigue pain two frequent symptom generate cancer treatment attribute alter sleep pattern . The new concept cluster fatigue , sleep pain need additional research strengthen begin scientific base . At point limited empirical study provide evidence foundational knowledge symptom cluster experience child cancer , thus new area knowledge develop soon possible management . Innovative intervention aim improve physical function sleep , fatigue , pain adherence positive health behavior regular walk warrant . In addition , one parent eligible child newly diagnose cancer recruit examine quality life perception uncertainty illness . ※ Specific aim : Control group ( 2010/1~2011/6 ) ： Aim 1 : Describe pattern `` fatigue , sleep disturbance , pain '' child cancer perspectives child parent course one cycle ( five day ) inpatient chemotherapy ( CXT ) . Aim 2 : Determine , various time point ( hospitalization various four time ) , association fatigue , sleep disturbance , pain course four cycle ( five day cycle ) CTX child cancer . Aim 3 : Examine association symptom cluster fatigue , sleep disturbance , pain , child report Quality Life Children Cancer ( QOLCC ) , parent report uncertainty QOL , biomarkers course four cycle CXT child cancer . Intervention group ( 2011/7~2012/12 ) ： Aim 4 : To test intervention program ( two 20-minute session walk around nurse 's station daily , five day cycle ) reduce symptom fatigue pain increase quality sleep . ※ Research Design Methods : The Human Response Model serve theoretical framework guide current propose study . The `` Individual Factors '' study include age , gender , type chemotherapeutic agent patient receive non-modifiable person factor . The `` Environmental factor '' include type room single room two bed three bed room number person room patient stay hospital . The `` Human response '' ( five day CTX ) include response 1 ) physiologic hemoglobin , hematocrit , urine 8-OHdG , 2 ) experiential feeling fatigue pain , 3 ) behavioral sleep response include sleep duration nighttime awakening . Children eligible study ( 1 ) age 10 18 year , ( 2 ) diagnose cancer , ( 3 ) prescribe CTX , ( 4 ) receive concomitant radiation , ( 5 ) undergone bone marrow transplantation . Patients central nervous system tumor ineligible sleep problem associate brain injury . Besides , patient osteosarcoma bone metastasis recruit may trouble walk . Based power analysis , total 160 eligible patient recruit , N = 80 control N = 80 intervention group . There total four observation period ( hospitalization various four time ) ( five day period ) ( O ) diagnose child cancer , next four consecutive hospitalization chemotherapy . The data study use analyze trend symptom change control group . 2011/7~2012/12 , intervention ( X ) two 20-minute walking implement daily activity , one morning one afternoon . Then four observation period procedure , frequency , describe measure use collect data . Following parental consent child assent , child wear wrist actigraph monitor sleep activity every day ( hospitalization various four time ) ( five day period ) ask complete Taiwanese version Memorial System Assessment Scale ( MSAS , 10-18 ) , Fatigue Scale ( 7-12 , 13-18 ) , QOLCC day 1 . Then measurement repeat every day follow consecutive five day cycle CXT least four cycle inpatient CTX . Parents ask complete SF-36 quality life Parent Perception Uncertainty Illness Scale day 0 every day follow consecutive five day one cycle CXT least four cycle inpatient CTX . Descriptive time series plot sleep variable generate individual group data . Repeated ANOVA ( mixed model analysis ) measurement evaluate changes/differences longitudinal data relate sleep fatigue . Individual time-series plot compare sleep , symptom cluster fatigue . ※ Anticipated Results : Knowledge develop study provide start point quality life child cancer promote identification factor contribute altered sleep hospital development intervention improve sleep .</detailed_description>
