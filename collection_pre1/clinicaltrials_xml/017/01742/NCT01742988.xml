	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , multi-center dose-escalation trial evaluate safety tolerability CUDC-907 single agent administer orally , daily , patient relapse refractory lymphoma multiple myeloma . The follow dosing schedule may examine , consist 21-day cycle include : ( ) continuous daily ( QD ) , ( ii ) twice weekly Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 ( BIW ) ( iii ) thrice weekly Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 ( TIW ) ( iv ) four day on/three day Days 1-4 , 8-11 , 15-18 ( 4/3 ) , ( v ) five day on/two day Days 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 ( 5/2 ) Sequential dose escalation cohort oral CUDC-907 plan . Subject enrollment dose escalation proceed accord standard 3+3 design . In absence DLT , subject treat minimum 21 day , may continue receive additional treatment disease progression document treatment discontinuation criterion meet . MTD BED expansion cohort 36 evaluable ( e.g. , 12 subject 2 3 specific tumor type subtype ) good define safety , tolerability preliminary antitumor pharmacodynamic activity study treatment , well suitability RP2D schedule . Safety tolerability assess incidence severity adverse event determine National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE v4.03 ) . A Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) comprise Medical Monitor , Principal Investigators , Sponsor representative , convene review safety information decide upon dose escalation subject enrollment . The antitumor activity study treatment assess accord standard response criterion appropriate individual subject 's tumor type ( e.g. , Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma International Uniform Response Criteria Multiple Myeloma ) . Exploratory biological marker activity assess peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , plasma tissue specimen ( skin , tumor bone marrow sample , available ) .</detailed_description>
