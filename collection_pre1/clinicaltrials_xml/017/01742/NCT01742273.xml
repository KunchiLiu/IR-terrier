	<brief_summary>Patients hemodialysis ( HD ) exhibit immensely increase cardiovascular mortality associate extensive vascular calcification ( VC ) . In past year development VC discover actively regulate influenced inhibitor calcification ( e.g . matrix-Gla-protein , fetuin-A ) . MGP produce vascular smooth muscle cell need post-translational modification vitamin K dependent gamma-carboxylation fully active . Based demonstration increase PIVKA-II level , 97 % HD patient exhibit insufficient carboxylation activity . We therefore aim randomize , control study retard progress coronary aortal calcification assess thoracic multislice-CT thrice weekly administration 5 mg vitamin K1 ( phylloquinone ) total 348 HD patient period 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients hemodialysis ( HD ) exhibit immensely increase cardiovascular mortality associate extensive vascular calcification ( VC ) . This form - least partially - reason excessively increase cardiovascular mortality population . In past year development VC discover actively regulate influenced inhibitor calcification ( e.g . matrix-Gla-protein , fetuin-A ) . Matrix Gla protein ( MGP ) powerful vascular wall-based inhibitor VC . MGP produce vascular smooth muscle cell need post-translational modification vitamin K dependent gamma-carboxylation fully active . The role MGP discover knock-out mouse , die rupture massively calcify aorta . Functional vitamin K deficiency induce administration warfarin lead development VC , turn inhibit subsequent administration vitamin K1 . Warfarin inhibit vitamin K mediate gamma-carboxylation , lead production noncarboxylated inactive MGP ( ucMGP ) . Warfarin widely use due inhibitory capacity activation coagulation factor . Now discover use vitamin K inhibitor influence vascular health : long-term use warfarin associate increase prevalence extent VC normal population HD patient . Warfarin also crucial risk factor development calciphylaxis , life-threatening complication HD patient characterise calcify cutaneous vessel . In turn , administration vitamin K1 accompany reduce intima-media-thickness ( IMT ) increase elasticity vessel postmenopausal woman . Based demonstration increase PIVKA-II level , 97 % HD patient exhibit insufficient carboxylation activity . Together increase VC represent ideal population interventional trial vitamin K system . Recently able demonstrate supplementation vitamin K1 patient well tolerate , show side effect induces dose dependent decrease inactive form Dephosphorylated noncarboxylated matrix Gla protein ( dpucMGP ) serum six week period . In trial also observe dialysis patient include insufficient vitamin K serum level , indicate substantial influence food intake vitamin K deficiency . In addition , demonstrate patient insufficient vitamin K level facilitate adequate MGP carboxylation .</detailed_description>
