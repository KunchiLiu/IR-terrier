	<detailed_description>The proportion elderly cancer patient high likely increase due increase cancer incidence age population . The prevalence impact age relate problem , however , poorly document , elderly patient may therefore subject under-treatment arbitrary modification treatment regimen . In order improve clinical practice , precise identification patient increase vulnerability risk adverse outcomes paramount . In present study , eligible patient identify referral oncology service one participate cancer unit . After consent , baseline registration perform include relevant medical sociodemographic data , quality life . Age related problem assess clinical indicator cover comorbidity , medication , emotional , physical cognitive function nutritional status . Muscle mass quantify analysis diagnostic CT scan biobank establish analysis inflammatory marker . Upon inclusion , patient ' physician ask rate patient fit , frail intermediate accord physician ' subjective judgement .
