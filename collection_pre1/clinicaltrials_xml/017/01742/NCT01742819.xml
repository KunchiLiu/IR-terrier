	<brief_summary>Glaucoma one lead cause blindness world . The key prevention visual loss glaucoma early detection disease progression timely treatment . The propose study investigate role various test improve detection disease progression advance glaucoma . Evaluation peripheral field vision ( visual field examination ) remain current standard detection progression glaucoma . However , lot variability inconsistency eye advance glaucoma , could make difficult detect worsen glaucoma visual field . The optic nerve demonstrate significant damage eye hence oftentimes repeat image optic nerve head helpful detection change . Therefore , image central retina ( innermost sensitive tissue line inside eye ) , call macula , propose supplant image nerve eye severe glaucoma . The macula aid detailed central vision . Since macular retinal neural cell last one affect glaucoma , measurement macular retinal thickness could provide significant information regard course glaucoma . In proposed study , glaucoma patient test follow various measurement do new version optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image visual field machine . The patient undergo repeat image visual field test every 6 month course 5 year . Rates change estimate . We explore change various outcome measure derive image correlate correspond visual field change glaucoma , whether former use alternative method detect simultaneous subsequent glaucoma progression . The hypothesis propose research macular OCT parameter valid structural measure use especially advanced disease follow course glaucoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glaucoma major public health issue worldwide manifest clinically chronic progressive optic neuropathy concomitant visual field ( VF ) loss . Glaucoma cause significant visual disability decrease quality life ( 1 ) . Based WHO 's report 2002 , glaucoma second cause blindness . The key prevention visual loss glaucoma early detection disease progression timely treatment . Glaucoma quite advance time initial detection . The prevalence advance glaucoma time diagnosis varies quite high . For example , average VF mean deviation ( MD ) patient diagnose glaucoma Los Angeles Latino Eye Study âˆ’9.6 dB ( 2 ) , represent moderately advanced severe glaucoma . Detection progression advance stage glaucoma continue challenge . Visual field examination remain gold standard detection progression advance glaucoma . However , long-term VF variability noise eyes significant , could confound detection change . The optic nerve head peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) demonstrate significant damage eye hence helpful detection change . About 50 % retinal ganglion cell ( RGCs ) locate within 4-5 mm macular center ( 3 ) . Since macular RGCs last one affect glaucoma , measurement macular retinal thickness retinal sublayers could provide significant information regard course advance glaucoma . The macular retinal sublayers measure reasonable accuracy SD- OCTs . There evidence measurement macular ganglion cell complex ( GCC , combine thickness RNFL , RGC inner plexiform layer IPL ) , macular retinal thickness volume may detect early glaucoma performance approximate circumpapillary RNFL thickness measurement ( 4,5 ) . In addition , macular measurement prove reproducible ( 4,6 ) . Given excellent reproducibility , macular outcome measure would main candidate follow glaucoma eye advance damage , macular region essentially retinal area residual RGCs .</detailed_description>
