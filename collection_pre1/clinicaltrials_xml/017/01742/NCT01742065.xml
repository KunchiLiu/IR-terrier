	<brief_summary>Only estimate 50 million US adult age 50-75 up-to-date colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen accord guideline set federal government . CRC 90 % curable timely detection appropriate treatment precancerous polyp ; increase screening could reduce incidence 50 % . Groups least likely undergo screening , minimal education , low income , low access health care , recent immigrant Hispanics , people frequently receive care Federally Qualified Healthcare Center 's ( FQHCs ) . The use fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) exceedingly low FQHCs ( 7-9 % patient past year ) far national average target rate . Our result provide valuable information use electronic health record ( EHR ) resource optimize guideline-based screening FQHC clinic whose patient population disproportionately low CRC screening rate . This project , conjunction research team , use advisory panel direct research activity . The advisory panel make clinician , leader , researcher , patient . The panel team guide development material , outreach patient , research protocol best reach FQHC patient due colorectal cancer screening . This project conduct two phase , Phase I conduct pilot two FQHC 's , Phase II roll intervention 20-30 clinic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase I ( Pilot Aims ) - Aim 1 Conduct preliminary analysis EHR data two pilot clinic . - Aim 2 : Use cod method develop Aim 1 test feasibility , reach , effectiveness , cost EHR-based CRC screen intervention use subset 100 patient two pilot clinic . We use code define Aim 1 create Solutions-based , Epic-integrated system track CRC screening , mail FIT kit , track patient test result receipt follow-up care . The system pilot-tested two clinic . - Aim 3 : Use result pilot intervention prepare large-scale , cluster-randomized pragmatic trial across 18 OCHIN clinic ( see Phase II ) . Transition Phase I Phase II -Changes original proposal include go three arm two-arm pragmatic cluster trial revise evaluation power calculation refinement intervention component usual care ( describe enhance usual care ) intervention ( describe enhance auto ) . Phase II ( Full trial Aims ) - Primary Aim 1 . Assess effectiveness large-scale , two-arm CRC screen program among diverse CLINIC patient , assess difference CRC screening outcome ( overall age , sex , insurance status , Hispanic ethnicity/race ) . The intervention consist automate data-driven , EHR-linked program mailing FIT kit ( linguistically appropriate pictographic instruction return postage ) patient due CRC screening . - Primary Aim 2 . Assess cost long-term cost-effectiveness automate program . We also include two secondary aim : - Secondary Aim 1 . Assess adoption , implementation , reach potential maintenance spread program , use mixed-method rapid assessment process , field note , ethnographic data . - Secondary Aim 2 . Adapt pilot-test adaptation STOP CRC alternate EHR platform , Allscripts , develop implementation guide assist site adopt program .</detailed_description>
