	<brief_summary>The study design test hypothesis BCG administration via jet injector produce comparable immune response significant difference safety reactogenicity BCG administration via jet injector needle syringe . The primary objective study ... 1 . Compare safety reactogenicity BCG administer intradermally jet injector device adult infant , BCG administer intradermally needle syringe ; 2 . Compare specific T cell immunity neonates vaccinated BCG via jet injector device infant vaccinate BCG via needle syringe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Bacille Calmette Guerin ( BCG ) Delivery Via Disposable Syringe Jet Injector Needle &amp; Syringe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomize , control , partially blind clinical trial 2 stage ( adult stage , infant stage ) apply single site . The first stage include thirty ( 30 ) adult participant . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) evaluate reactogenicity safety data 30 adult day 28 vaccination . Pending favourable safety review DSMB , second stage sixty-six ( 66 ) newborn participant commence . Potential adult infant participant screen prior enrolment apply inclusion exclusion criteria.Note adult stage pilot , result infant study present . In stage half study population ( 15 adult , 33 neonate ) receive BCG via conventional syringe needle ( standard care administration technique ) , half ( 15 adult , 33 neonate ) receive BCG via jet injector ( investigational administration technique ) . A single standard volume dose BCG administer per package insert . Neonates receive BCG shortly birth . The occurrence injection site reactogenicity event systemic adverse event compare study group adult neonate . In neonate stage , BCG M.tb specific immunogenicity also compare study group . For adult stage vaccinator participant unblinded study arm allocation . For infant stage , vaccinator unblinded participant caregiver blind . For adult infant stage follow-up team blind study arm allocation . The laboratory blind study arm allocation infant stage immunogenicity assay . The trial conduct field site South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative ( SATVI ) Cape Winelands East district Western Cape South Africa . Recruitment vaccination neonate take place 1 state public healthcare antenatal clinic birth unit area . Recruitment vaccination adult , well follow-up adult neonates/infants take place SATVI field site premise , premise public healthcare clinic . All study procedure , include vaccination , perform SATVI study staff .</detailed_description>
