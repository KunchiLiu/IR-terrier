	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer account one third new cancer diagnose men approximately 30 % men external beam radiotherapy primary local therapy . Prostate motion radiotherapy divide interfraction intrafraction motion . Interfraction motion well establish largely overcome daily online image verification either ultrasound , online CT implant fiducial marker , however motion radiation beam time ( intrafraction motion ) correct cause significant error radiation dose delivery . Intrafraction motion : Movement prostate initial treatment setup term intrafraction motion . Estimates magnitude frequency motion initially make use continuous Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) imaging . Padhani et al report 16 % patient &gt; 5mm anterior : posterior motion image 7 minute similar result report subsequent MR cine study , Intrafraction motion secondary organ motion bladder filling , respiration move rectal gas , due physical patient motion . With availability real-time prostate tracking , clinical data available quantify magnitude frequency motion . An early report Kupelian et al use continuous radiotransponder positioning7 describe 41 % fraction &gt; 3mm motion 15 % &gt; 5mm motion &gt; 30 second . The risk motion note increase longer treatment time . Our data use offline autosegmentation fiducial marker position 10 patient show 38 % fraction &gt; 1mm , 4.7 % fraction &gt; 3mm 1.7 % fraction &gt; 5mm instantaneously treatment delivery approximately 2.5 min 8 . Significance correct motion : If radiation dose recalculate individual fraction adjust intrafraction motion possible estimate real dose deliver target compare desire dose . This comparison give robust model potential benefit real- time track adjustment motion . Overview kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring ( KIM ) : Kilovoltage intrafraction monitor novel real-time tumour localisation modality . It involve single gantry- mount kV x-ray imager ( widely available linac ) acquire 2D projection implant fiducial marker . As treatment gantry rotate around patient treatment , kV imager acquire 2D projection prostate . The fiducial marker segment use in-house develop software package . 3D position determine via maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) 3D probability density . In previous work ( Ng et al , 2012 ) apply KIM method offline segmentation calculate 3D prostate trajectory treatment . In present study utilise online marker segmentation enable live trajectory creation treatment delivery processing time le 1 second . With circa real-time trajectory able gate delivery maximise dose tumour , track Multi-Leaf Collimators ( MLC ) follow prostate motion . The latter involve complex interaction beam delivery system part study . The treatment gate base pre-set tolerance . Using early data model several gate criterion 3mm/5s , 3mm/10s 3mm/15s base excursion along individual ax also radial excursion . Across 10 patient , tolerance 3mm/5s show efficient , introduce 24 gate event ( 268 treatment ) safe , small time excursion ( 5 ) . The KIM method introduce extra radiation dose patient approximately 65mSv per treatment localise prostate 8 . Standard treatment dos prostate radiotherapy 80 Gy . The amount image dose dependent image field size , frame rate acquire image , treatment field size , kV energy use method treatment delivery ( Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy [ VMAT ] , Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy [ IMRT ] , Stereotactic Boost Radiotherapy [ SBRT ] ) .9 We minimise image dose previous study 8 : - reduce field size encompass fiducials small margin per patient image dose deliver inside treatment volume ( expect 20-40 % dose saving ) ; - beam quality maximise 125 kV ; - patient dimension limit large patient create scatter radiation ( decrease image quality ) absorb radiation . This , combine treatment field size , may allow u use low frame rate image acquisition , 10 fps 5 fps , proportional effect dose ; - patient nodal area treatment exclude treatment field large reduces image quality . By exclude large patient may able use 5fps rather 10 fps image combined patient dimension ; - VMAT show require less treatment time IMRT delivery , SBRT show require less total time conventional fractionation ( total treatment time proportional imaging dose ) . We expect see dose reduction VMAT-SBRT protocol compare VMAT 20-40 % . Together image dose , need consider weight gain intrafraction monitor gate treatment . These gain include improve accuracy deliver dose , plan treatment dose deliver efficiently tumour , geometric accuracy would allow reduction safety margin introduce compensate treatment . We demonstrate significant improvement tumour dose 60 % 95 % intend dose distribution gate 3mm/5s tolerance show Figure 1 . Verification KIM clinical dynamic localization accuracy use kV/MV triangulation : In order evaluate dynamic localisation accuracy KIM method , 3D position determine KIM compare kV/MV triangulation . kV/MV triangulation . Triangulation provide independent measure prostate location . Failure Mode Effects Analysis ( FMEA ) Quality Assurance ( QA ) protocol An FMEA perform identify potential failure mode within additional KIM workflow . The standard workflow establish quality assurance measure place . All KIM failure mode mitigate numerous layer quality assurance measure , clear design user interface , clear designation staff role , staff education , exclusion criterion patient selection .</detailed_description>
