	<brief_summary>COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) long-lasting lung disease usually cause long-term smoking . COPD get bad , make people sick enough need hospitalization . Corticosteroids effective almost always use , nobody know right dose . High dos may work well could cause side effect low dos . Typical treatment length last least one week .

	<detailed_description>The goal study determine whether high-dose corticosteroid regimen patient admit hospital COPD exacerbation associate well clinical outcome acceptable risk adverse effect compare low-dose corticosteroid regimen . Our hypothesis high-dose corticosteroid associate decreased rate treatment failure , short length hospital stay , improve quality life similar risk adverse effect . The study population include patient ≥ 40 years-old ≥ 10 pack-years smoke history diagnosis COPD , emphysema , chronic bronchitis present emergency room increase dyspnea , increase sputum , increase cough require admission hospital . We perform prospective , randomize , double-blinded study determine high-dose corticosteroid regimen , already use clinical practice , decrease treatment failure compare low-dose corticosteroid regimen base national consensus guideline .</detailed_description>
