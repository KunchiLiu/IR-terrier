	<brief_summary>Cisplatinum pemetrexed ( ALIMTA® ) become effective first-line regimen advance inoperable non-squamous NSCLC without somatic activate mutation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . In standard regimen cisplatinum dose 75 mg/m2 day 1 21-day cycle . Due high platinum-dose patient need strict hyperhydration often hospitalize survey . Split-dose cisplatinum two administration Day 1 8 21-day-cycle already administer platin-containing chemotherapy regimen ( cis/gem cis/nav cis/paclitaxel cis/docetaxel ) favourable toxicity profile generally excellent patient compliance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatinum/Pemetrexed Versus Split-dose Cisplatinum/Pemetrexed In NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There current need develop split-dose cisplatinum regimen combination pemetrexed high efficacy , excellent treatment compliance , administration convenience possibility open easy outpatient administration chemotherapy protocol . Dosing cisplatinum 40 mg/m2 1 day 8 seem effective useful strategy . The current trial address issue within prospective randomize phase-II trial . Treatment give day 1 8 split-dose arm . A comparator arm current three-weekly high cisplatinum schedule add study . For evaluation strategy observation toxicity/efficacy ratio within trial major importance . Efficacy analyze objective response rate , symptom control life-quality . Toxicity look treatment toxicity , treatment compliance adherence protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis nonsquamouscell nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) Stage IV ( American Joint Committee Cancer Staging Criteria [ AJCC ] , Version 7 , 2009 ) 2 . No prior systemic chemotherapy lung cancer 3 . At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion meeting Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ; version 1.1 , Eisenhauer et al . 2009 ) , long diameter ≥10 mm compute tomography ( CT ) scan [ CT scan slice thickness great 5 mm ] , ≥ 20 mm chest xray . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan ultrasound use . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Oken et al . 1982 ) 5 . ≥ 18 year age &lt; 75 year 6 . Adequate organ function , 7 . Prior radiation therapy allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow ( Cristy Eckerman 1987 ) . Prior radiation whole pelvis allow . Prior radiotherapy must complete least 4 week study enrollment . Patients must recover acute toxic effect treatment prior study enrollment . 8 . Patient must understand sign inform consent document start specific protocol procedure . 9 . A pretreatment FFPE tumour biopsy must available central biomarker analysis . If consent patient clinically feasible , fresh pretreatment biopsy obtain submitted central biomarker analysis . 10 . Female patient childbearing potential must use highly effective method contraception ( combined oral contraceptive , hormonreleasing intrauterine contraceptive device , hormonal contraceptive implant , hormonal contraceptive injectables ) sexual intercourse vasectomise partner 6 month study pregnancy test must negative within 7 day prior study enrollment . A female subject consider childbearing potential unless age ≥ 50 year naturally amenorrhoeic ≥ 2 year unless surgically sterile . Male patient must agree use condom study 6 month study partner childbearing potential use highly effective method contraception . 11 . Estimated life expectancy 12 week 12 . Patient compliance geographic proximity allow adequate follow . Patients exclude study meet follow criterion : 1 . Active participation clinical study treatment experimental drug within 30 day prior study enrollment study participation . 2 . Patients know somatic activating mutation EGFR , patient offer EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFRTKI ) treatment firstline therapy . Detection EGFR mutation additional somatic mutation relation treatment perform centrally Universitätsklinikum Essen . In case immediate treatment initiation require medical reason ( superior vena cava syndrome , severely symptomatic disease ) patient may enrol result EGFR test available . As EGFRTKI treatment equally effective secondline therapy , patient may remain study treatment clinical benefit derive . 3 . Peripheral neuropathy ³CTCAE Grade 1 4 . Inability comply protocol study procedures 5 . A serious concomitant systemic disorder , opinion investigator , would compromise patient 's ability complete study . 6 . A serious cardiac condition , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study enrollment , symptomatic coronary artery disease , cardiac arrhythmia , heart disease , define New York Heart Association Class III IV ( functional capacity ) 7 . Second primary malignancy clinically detectable time consideration study enrollment 8 . Documented brain metastasis unless patient complete successful local therapy central nervous system metastases corticosteroid least 4 week enrollment . Brain imaging require symptomatic patient rule brain metastasis , require asymptomatic patient 9 . The effect third space fluid , pleural effusion ascites , pemetrexed unknown . In patient clinically significant third space fluid , consideration give drain effusion prior pemetrexed administration . 10 . Significant weight loss ( 10 % ) previous 6 week study entry 11 . Significant hearing function impairment , especially highfrequency hear function impairment 12 . Any active uncontrolled infection 13 . Concurrent administration antitumour therapy 14 . Inability interrupt aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent , aspirin dose &lt; 1.3 gram per day , 5day period ( 8day period longacting agent , piroxicam ) 15 .
