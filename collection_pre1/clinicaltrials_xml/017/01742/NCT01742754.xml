	<brief_summary>Fecal microbiota therapy ( FMT ) emerge treatment gastrointestinal disorder mark imbalance intestinal microbial flora ( dysbiosis ) . It hypothesize work shift recipient 's microbiota toward eubiotic microbial community resist colonization pathogenic organism decrease inherent inflammatory property . Several study report efficacy treatment severe Clostridium difficile colitis . Preliminary study use FMT Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) also meet success . This corroborate several line evidence suggest dysbiosis play important role UC pathogenesis . While recent study use FMT patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) constipation find transplant persist 2 year , extent microbiota alterable UC known . Indeed , may particular genetic immunologic factor UC lead selection pressure prevent change microbiota . As initial step investigate potential efficacy stool transplant Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) , investigator propose determine feasibility stability transplant microbiota series 10 patient mild moderate UC .</brief_summary>
