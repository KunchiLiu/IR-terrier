	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Advagraf v Prograf Kidney Transplantation Patients 1 Month After Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicenter , open-label , randomize , parallel , comparative clinical trial . All enrolled subject treat Prograf® ( Tacrolimus ) , Basilixumab , Corticosteroids , Mycophenolate Mofetil suppress immune system one month ( 30 day ) kidney transplant . After one month , experimental group ( 30 subject ) treat Advagraf® ( Extended Release Tacrolimus ) instead Prograf® ( Tacrolimus ) , Corticosteroids Mycophenolate Mofetil maintain . The control group ( 30 subject ) continuously receive Prograf® ( Tacrolimus ) , Corticosteroids , Mycophenolate Mofetil . The clinical progress subject experimental control group six month transplant investigate compare .</detailed_description>
