	<brief_title>Three Methods Best PEEP Determination Compared With PEEP Determination Guided Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The determination optimal level Positive End Expiratory Pressure ( PEEP ) patient acute hypoxemic respiratory pressure remain elusive controversial . Several approach different algorithms exist . Among , Low PEEP algorithm approach High PEEP algorithm approach . These approach characterize generalized application certain level PEEP accord predefined algorithm . However , algorithms fail account inter-individual variation patient different disease different severity underlie process . Therefore , advocate individualize application PEEP . Whereby , PEEP determine individually patient base familiar well establish physiological parameter .</detailed_description>
