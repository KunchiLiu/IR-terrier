	<detailed_description>Background : Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) low extremity due arterial obstruction lead reduce arterial flow exercise and/or rest . The disease present approximately 4 percent person &gt; 40 year age , 15-20 percent &gt; 65 year . Claudication major symptom improve pharmacotherapy exercise rehabilitation . In patient disable claudication persist despite exercise pharmacotherapy critical limb ischemia ( i.e . ischemic rest pain ; ulcer gangrene risk major amputation ) , revascularization therapy indicate . However , 1/4 patient endovascular surgical therapy fail applicable , make alternative approach necessary.1 Thus , promotion angiogenesis , process trigger ischemia sprout capillary insufficient provide adequate blood supply jeopardize tissue , arteriogenesis , refers positive remodel preformed collateral arteriole , i.e . collateral growth apply patients.2 , 3 Despite fact numerous study last decade pursue important therapeutic strategy improve collateral function patient PAD , currently method available quantify collateral arterial function lower limb , thus , determine therapeutic effect . Clinical study investigate new therapeutic strategy promotion peripheral collateral growth application growth factor and/or exercise rehabilitation use imprecise inadequate assessment method therefore determine `` weak '' endpoint . In contrast coronary circulation , currently gold standard available document successful promotion collateral growth patient suffer PAD . Aim : The purpose study patient undergo elective coronary angiography without chronic stable coronary artery disease evaluate new invasive method quantify arterial collateral flow low extremity . Main hypothesis : Quantitative assessment peripheral arterial collateral pressure-derived collateral flow index ( CFIp ) low extremity safe feasible . Methodology : Prospective exploratory trial . Primary study endpoint : Pressure-derived collateral flow index ( CFIp ) superficial femoral artery . Potential significance : The result study demonstrate concept collateral flow index - proven group coronary circulation - safe feasible method quantitative assessment peripheral limb collateral function . The result study may serve preliminary data large clinical trial investigate therapeutic promotion collateral patient PAD provide reliable study endpoint .</detailed_description>
