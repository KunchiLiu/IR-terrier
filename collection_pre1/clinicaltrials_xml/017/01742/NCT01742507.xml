	<brief_summary>Stent coverage neo-intimal growth evaluate in-detail intracoronary optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , catheter-based imaging technique . It perform part PCI procedure . OCT optical analogue intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) , except provide much high resolution coronary cross sectional image IVUS . The LightLab C7XR OCT system ( Frequency Domain OCT ) use Hospital obtain full CE Mark , approve US FDA , approve clinical use Hong Kong . It show safe clinical setting use 300 patient without complication Queen Mary Hospital . In study , stent coverage neo-intimal growth zotarolimus-eluting stent ( ZES ) biolimus-eluting stent ( BES ) compare use OCT 9 month specific post-intervention re-study interval . The investigator objective investigate clinical impact OCT difference early stent heal late lumen loss two new-generation limus-eluting-stents - Resolute Integrity Biomatrix , differ stent design , elute drug coat polymer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Two Stent Degree Early Stent Healing Late Lumen Loss.The OCT-ORION Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomised , assessor-blinded , single centre study . Patients symptomatic coronary artery diseases 2 3 coronary vessel require PCI eligible study . PCI perform usual manner study lesion procedure . In randomized fashion , patient one artery critical disease ( ) treat Resolute Integrity Stent ( ) artery treat Biomatrix Stent ( ) . Baseline OCT data obtain right stenting . The remain coronary artery , diseased require PCI treatment , treat angiographic OCT follow-up stag procedure . Patients randomly assign 5 group equal number , receive follow-up coronary angiogram OCT 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 month interval post-intervention . Each patient serve his/her control compare 2 type stent . At 9-month post-intervention , patient receive second follow-up coronary angiogram OCT. All OCT data analysis perform blinded fashion core laboratory . Phone follow carry cardiac event 1 year 2 year post intervention .</detailed_description>
