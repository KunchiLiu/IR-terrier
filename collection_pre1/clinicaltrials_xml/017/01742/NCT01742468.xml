	<brief_title>Intervention With Long-chain n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids From Microalgae Oil Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study suggest daily intake n-3 LC-PUFA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ) support therapy chronic-inflammatory disease might useful prevent coronary heart disease . The majority study differentiate effect EPA DHA . The present study investigate therapeutic potential DHA patient rheumatoid arthritis . As precondition participate study , patient provide information write verbally form detail study . Written inform consent obtain volunteer . Before begin study , patient subject medical examination general rheumatologist . Thirty-eight patient rheumatoid arthritis ( DAS ≥ 2.4 ) enter study . The placebo-controlled , randomized double-blind cross-over study consist two investigation period 10 week , ten-week washout period ( washout period intervention cross group respective product consume 10 week ) . Patients placebo period receive 60 g sausage , 8 g tomato spread 30 g milk powder ( = 200 mL milk beverage ) daily . These product enrich sunflower oil ( 8 g/d ) . In intervention period , product ( 60 g sausage , 8 g tomato spread 30 g milk powder ( = 200 mL milk beverage ) enrich 8 g microalgae oil ( Schizochytrium sp. , Maris DHA oil , . 3790 , IOI , Hamburg , Germany ) . In group , daily dose docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) amount 2.11 g. Venous blood collect begin end period . • Disease activity determine sum tender swollen joint ( 68/66 ) , joint score DAS28 , ultrasound score ( US-7 score ) , rheumascan , inflammatory marker ( ESR , C reactive protein ) , HAQ questionnaire lifestyle form</detailed_description>
