	<brief_summary>Formal study hypothesis : Cranial reconstruction use mesenchymal stromal cell resorbable biomaterials , result patient produce bone fill void reduce risk infection resorption , lead well cosmetic result obviate long term consequence synthetic material vivo . Introduction : There several reason part skull may need remove : - After trauma relieve brain swell - During brain surgery ( brain cancer ) - After trauma bone badly fractured/fragmented need remove . In last case bone flap temporarily store freezer brain swell subside reinserted . This procedure call `` autologous cranioplasty '' ; autologous , originally come patient cranioplasty , refer repair . Although straightforward procedure , number complication include infection bone resorption occur . This study : Stromal cell proven ability aid bony heal . Furthermore stromal cell ceramic framework encase plastic scaffold show small clinical trial lead heal skull defect . In present study , propose add stromal cell suitable donor medical grade ceramic granule , place specially mould plastic scaffold insert sandwich skull . Both ceramic plastic material medical grade commonly use reconstructive surgery , ceramic packing bony defect due trauma removal cancer polymer bony reconstruction . Both material approve TGA . They design dissolve away time body 's blood vessel cell populate sandwich create patient 's new bone . It proven without encouragement cell temporary scaffold material , hole skull heal . Given incidence bone resorption/infection metal plate infection use traditional method , would seem prudent provide construct allow control replacement patient 's bone , thus negate adverse long-term complication synthetic material remain life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cranial bone defect often leave follow brain surgery , usually allow swell brain recover subsequently re-implanting protective cover brain late time ( cranioplasty ) . These procedure perform anywhere cranial vault , either unilaterally bilaterally . The original piece bone ( autologous bone plate = bone flap ) place sterile container store refrigerator temperature -40oC . Weeks month later , brain relaxed , scalp well heal patient 's medical condition permit , individual take back operating room bone reimplanted ( A procedure know autologous cranioplasty ) . The aim procedure restore cosmesis protection underlie brain sometimes also improve neurological symptom unknown mechanism . Unfortunately aim always achieve whilst technically straightforward procedure know associated number complication . Two significant infection ( bone flap need remove replace ) resorption ( protective function compromise ) . Overall 10 % autologous bone patient become infected , 10 % require replacement due resorption 12 % become significantly resorbed , 32 % case autologous bone fail . In case cranioplasty failure patient require readmission , second operation remove bone flap , prolong antibiotic therapy ( case infection ) , new custom-made plate readmission third surgical procedure . In case synthetic material polymethylmethacrylate titanium mesh use reconstruction . Commonly reconstruction carry surgeon use material sculpt cranioplasty . More recently , hydro form titanium plate use . This entail process CT scan defect , virtual reconstruction , 3D printing mould , press plate hand finish . Whilst highly successful treat 150 patient , titanium cranioplasty remain patient life , non-biological material , present preferential site infection ( approximately 5 % case ) . In addition , medical CT image assessment treatment neurological condition compromise life due metal artefact arise plate . Furthermore , interference metal scan equipment commonly use security purpose also remain life time issue . The patient infect titanium cranioplasty require fourth admission remove metal polymer plate , extend antibiotic treatment fifth surgical procedure reinsert new cranioplasty . Mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSC ) : MSC multipotent adult cell capable differentiate multiple mesenchymal lineage . They adherent fibroblastoid-like cell extensive capacity expansion . They reside within connective tissue organ isolate bone marrow , placenta , adipose tissue , umbilical cord , amniotic fluid , circulate blood , various foetal tissue , skeletal muscle synovia , dental pulp , liver , spleen , lung dermis . Most work focus MSC derive bone marrow , however , also clinical report use adipose tissue placental derive MSC . MSC different source may functionally equivalent exhibit differentiation potential . The main function bone marrow derive MSC regard present study ability differentiate osteogenic lineage . It ability differentiate see apply bony non-union treatment critical size bone skeletal deficit , particular reconstruction cranial void . In current proposal Cell Tissue Therapies W.A . Royal Perth Hospital extensive experience apply TGA ( Therapeutics Goods Administration , Australian Government regulatory authority ) licence manufacture provide MSC patient treatment . MSC immunogenic escape recognition alloreactive T cell NK cell . They low level expression HLA class I expression HLA class II . They express co-stimulatory molecule unable induce T cell mediate immune response , therefore use universal donor cell . Allogeneic cell widely use clinical trial immune modulation tissue repair . The advantage use allogeneic cell donor age control . The literature indicate MSC harvest donor older 40 year inferior . Since many patient treat cranioplasty great 40 year age , use allogeneic cell study preferable . Clinical human trial animal study support use allogeneic cell . Cranioplasty : The Department Medical Engineering Physics Royal Perth Hospital world leader provide custom make implant supply custom make titanium cranioplasties fifteen year . The basic methodology use treat 150 patient include reconstruction void use advanced software base patient CT scan . Once void reconstruct female mould create press titanium plate . The plate hand finish checked fitment premade defect model . Bioceramic : Resorbable bioceramics hydroxyapatite beta tri-calcium phosphate use treatment bony deficit many year . For example , ChronOS ( Synthes GmbH , Oberdorf ) bone graft substitute fully synthetic resorbable bone graft substitute consist beta-tricalcium phosphate compressive strength similar cancellous bone . The interconnected porosity act osteconductive matrix ingrowth bone cell blood vessel . Such material use fill bone defect trauma , reconstruction correction non-load bearing indication commonly material prescribe method perfusion granule operate room patient 's bone marrow . Resorption bioceramics show occur period 6-18 month ( Buser 1998 ) . Polymer Scaffold : There myriad polymer material use surgery include area cranio-maxillofacial surgery . The common polymer poly ( lactic acid ) . PLA 70:30 poly ( L-lactide-co-D , L-lactide ) make amorphous biodegradable copolymer ultimately resorb vivo . The bioceramics polymer material approve TGA indication .</detailed_description>
