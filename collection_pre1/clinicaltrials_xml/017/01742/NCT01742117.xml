	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel anti-platelet medication approve U.S. Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) coronary stent implantation . Anti-platelet medication work prevent blood clot form . Some study suggest patient certain genetic liver enzyme abnormality ( know cytochrome P450 2C19 [ CYP2C19 ] *2 *3 allele ) may reduce ability activate clopidogrel , therefore may lower response clopidogrel . It think perhaps people coronary stent procedure may genetic liver enzyme abnormality . There research genetic test available determine whether someone genetic liver enzyme abnormality . Ticagrelor , new anti-platelet drug dependent CYP2C19 liver enzyme activation hence poor clopidogrel metabolizers , alternative drug like Ticagrelor recommend use anti-platelet agent PCI . The purpose study determine genetic test identify best anti-platelet therapy , patient undergo coronary stent placement activate clopidogrel well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TAILOR-PCI multi-site , open label , prospective , randomized trial test hypothesis percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , use genotyping strategy ticagrelor 90 mg twice per day superior clopidogrel 75 mg per day reduce composite endpoint major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) , i.e. , non-fatal myocardial infarction , non-fatal stroke , severe recurrent ischemia , cardiovascular ( CV ) death , stent thrombosis ( primary endpoint ) CYP2C19 reduce function allele patient . Patients undergo PCI randomize conventional therapy arm ( i.e. , receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily without prospective genotyping guidance ) versus prospective CYP2C19 genotype-based anti-platelet therapy approach ( ticagrelor 90 mg bid CYP2C19 *2 *3 reduce function allele patient , clopidogrel 75 mg daily non-*2 -*3 CYP2C19 patient ) . Buccal swab obtain subject randomize prospective genotyping arm . All subject blood sample drawn DNA analysis genotyping use DNA sample perform completion duration anti-platelet therapy ( i.e. , one year ) . The primary endpoint assess prospectively compare conventional arm prospective genotyping arm among identified reduce function CYP2C19 allele carrier accord 1-year genotype result .</detailed_description>
