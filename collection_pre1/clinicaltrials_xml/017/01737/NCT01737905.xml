	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Safety Single Dose E004 Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , crossover , single dose study conduct pediatric patient ( 4 - 11 year ) asthma . The main feature study design : The entire study consist Screening Visit , Study Period consist two ( 2 ) crossover Study Visits separate 2 14-day interval . All study subject must properly consent , adult supervision , screen inclusion exclusion criterion Screening Visit confirm enrollment Visit 1 . Efficacy safety evaluation E004 conduct Study Visit . This study employ two ( 2 ) double-blinded treatment arm outline Table 2 . A double-blinded design apply E004 ( Arm T ) Placebo-HFA ( Arm P ) since identical physical attribute share comparable formulation . The enrolled subject randomize two sequence ( follow ) participate two ( 2 ) crossover Study Visits 2 - 14 day interval visit . Randomization achieve use ratio 1:1 . Use E004 ( T ) Placebo ( P ) Visits 1 2 , respectively use Placebo ( P ) E004 ( T ) Visits 1 2 , respectively Subjects trained screen visit Study Visit correct dose spirometry method . Under supervision dose monitor , subject self-administer two ( 2 ) inhalation randomize study treatment , ~1 min interval Study Visit . For Screening Study Visits , subject require site 30 minute `` resting period '' . This resting period design maintain stable consistent physical status subject prior start baseline FEV1 procedure . For Screening Visit , period begin upon subject arrival . For Study Visits , period begin end option breakfast ( upon arrival breakfast decline ) . For Study Visit , subject need arrive study site early enough complete necessary baseline evaluation . The study site provide optional breakfast must eat least 30 minute prior pre-dose baseline FEV1 measurement . The optional breakfast light , contain add sugar . If subject decline breakfast ( i.e . already eaten light breakfast prior arriving ) , require remain site least 30 minute prior start Baseline FEV1 measurement , order maintain stable physical status . Baseline vital sign safety evaluation take prior pre-dose baseline FEV1 measurement . These perform 30 minute `` resting period '' . Efficacy treatment visit evaluate base spirometric measurement serial FEV1 determine Pre-dose Baseline , seven ( 7 ) serial Post-dose FEV1 responses 5 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 150 , 180 ) 240 minute . This study conduct double-blinded technique . This mean neither subject site staff aware identity treatment arm since study treatment identical look container .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Generally healthy male , premenarchal female , child age 4 11 year upon Screening . With documented asthma , require inhale epinephrine β2agonist treatment , without concurrent antiinflammatory therapy include orally inhaled corticosteroid , least 6months prior Screening . Being capable perform spirometry FEV1 measurement . Satisfying criterion asthma stability , define significant change asthma therapy ( exception switch LABA SABA , adjustment ICor SABA , etc , per investigator discretion ) asthmarelated hospitalization emergency room visit , within 4 week prior Screening . Can tolerate withholding treatment inhale bronchodilator allow medication minimum washout period indicate Appendix II prior Screening Baseline FEV1 test . Demonstrating Mean Screening Baseline FEV1 ( MSBF ) 50.0 % 90 % Polgar predict normal value . Demonstrating Airway Reversibility , i.e. , FEV1 value ≥12 % increase base upon volume compare MSBF , within 30 min 2 inhalation ( 440 mcg , epinephrine base ) previously market Epinephrine CFCMDI , label `` For Investigational Use Only '' . There 5 reversibility time point , 5 maneuver conduct anytime within 30 min postdose . Demonstrating satisfactory technique use metereddose inhaler ( MDI ) . Has properly consent participate study . Any current past medical condition , per investigator discretion , might significantly affect pharmacodynamic response study drug , significant systemic respiratory disease ( e.g. , cystic fibrosis , bronchiectasis , active tuberculosis , emphysema , nonreversible pulmonary disease ) , asthma . Concurrent clinically significant cardiovascular , hematological , renal , neurologic , hepatic , endocrine , psychiatric , malignant disease . Known intolerance hypersensitivity component study drug ( i.e. , Epinephrine , HFA134a , CFC12 , CFC114 , polysorbate80 , thymol , ethanol , ascorbic acid , nitric acid , hydrochloric acid ) , well rescue Albuterol HFA inhaler ( i.e. , Albuterol , HFA134a , ethanol , oleic acid ) . Recent infection upper respiratory tract ( within 2 week ) , low respiratory tract ( within 4 week ) , screen . Use prohibit medication per Appendix II . Having investigational drug/device study last 30 day prior screen .</criteria>
