	<brief_summary>Removal colorectal adenoma prevents occurence colorectal cancer . The use chromo-endoscopy show improve detection flat adenoma . Narrow band image enables endoscopists accurately describe pit pattern adenoma .

	<brief_title>Comparison Between White Light Endoscopy Bright Narrow Band Imaging Diagnosis Colonic Adenomas .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Removal colorectal adenoma prevents occurrence cancer [ 1 ] . It recognize colonoscopy miss colorectal adenomas early cancer [ 2 ] . There need improve performance colonoscopy . The use chromoendoscopy show improve detection flat adenoma [ 3 ] . Narrow band imaging introduce year 2006 . It similar chromoendoscopy provide mucosal detail . This enable endoscopists accurately describe pit pattern adenoma . NBI use substitute chromoendoscopy . In pooled analysis , NBI comparable chromoendoscopy sensitivity specificity diagnosis malignant colorectal adenoma [ 4 ] . Unfortunately , use NBI show conclusively improve rate colorectal adenoma detection . Two 3 randomized trial compare WLE NBI show high adenoma detection rate use NBI [ 5 , 6 ] . In study Rex et al. , rate however similar either modality . In pooled analysis , NBI marginally well WLE [ 7 ] . The effective use NBI depend quality bowel preparation experience endoscopist . In presence fecal matter , NBI tend dark detection small adenoma become difficult . The prototype bright NBI couple high definition resolution likely overcome drawback original NBI .</detailed_description>
