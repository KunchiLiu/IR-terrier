	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Cognitive Dysfunction Obese Adolescents : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The short-term goal project conduct feasibility study Winthrop University Hospital determine well extremely obese ( BMI &gt; 99 % tile correct age ) child adolescent recruit exercise program evaluate efficient fashion , identify particular strategy ( e.g. , medical examination feedback ) serve potential benefit research subject family . In addition investigator evaluate effect exercise program physical fitness , insulin resistance , neurocognitive functioning well relationship insulin sensitivity neurocognitive function among adolescent participate exercise program . The long-term goal project evaluate large , multi-ethnic sample adolescent , 14 19 year age , systematically assess cognitive function school performance , fitness examine relationship performance outcome variable variety biomedical psychosocial factor may directly indirectly influence brain function test-taking performance . High body mass index ( BMI ) among child adolescent continue public health concern United States . The recent figure National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 2007-2008 report 18.1 % ( 95 % CI , 14.5 % -21.7 % ) 12- 19-year-old adolescent 95th percentile BMI age . Children high BMI often become obese adult , obese adult risk many chronic condition . High BMI child may also immediate consequence , elevate lipid concentration blood pressure . It appear neurocognitive dysfunction also common obese child adolescent . In large population study 2,519 child , 8 16 year age , brief neuropsychological assessment show statistically significant , albeit modest relationship cognitive test score BMI persist adjust confound variable . Obesity also associate several condition know affect brain function , include sleep apnea , insulin resistance , hypertension , chronic inflammatory factor ( e.g. , variable determine , unfortunately , variable measure . It important note , however , complete agreement linkages obesity cognition .</detailed_description>
