	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study RD94 Patients With Endodontic Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY : This multi-centre open-label study comprise six group correspond six indication test . No placebo reference product involve . No randomization require indication define patient selection . The six indication study : - Direct pulp cap follow carious pulp exposure - Direct pulp cap follow dental trauma injury healthy pulp ( partial pulpotomy ) - Repairing perforated root canal and/or pulp chamber floor - Retrograde endodontic surgery - Pulpotomy primary molar - Apexification Study start : October 2009 Inclusion period : 1/10/2009 30/06/2011 Study duration : 2 year OBJECTIVES : The trial objective illustrate clinical efficacy tolerance RD94 indication describe . Primary objective : The primary objective show RD94 easily apply claimed indication evaluate efficacy . This define 6 month follow-up . Secondary objective : The secondary objective evaluate efficacy RD94 two year follow-up important safety longevity product . TRIAL POPULATION AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS : 60 patient three French study center , 10 per indication study . Depending indication , child ( 3 year onwards ) , and/or adult include . DURATION OF TREATMENT : The product apply D0 ( Inclusion ) study . The follow-up period include 2 year six visit : Visit1 - Week 1 , Visit 2 - Month 1 , Visit 3 - Month 3 , Visit 4 - Month 6 , Visit 5 - Year 1 , Visit 6 - Year 2 .</detailed_description>

Direct pulp cap follow dental trauma injury healthy pulp , reformulate partial pulpotomy child ( 6 18 year ) + adults Permanent mature immature singleroot tooth suffer traumatic injury &lt; 72 hour , amelodentinal coronal fracture cause pulp exposure . Repairing perforated root canal and/or pulp chamber floor adult Iatrogenic perforation pulpal floor , without LEO . Iatrogenic perforate root canal follow post space preparation involve dentin matrix , without LEO . Iatrogenic perforate root canal strip involve dentin matrix , without LEO . Retrograde endodontic surgery adult Failure endodontic treatment retreatment , evidence recent persistent clinical radiological sign LEO and/or symptom tooth root canal filling look sufficiently good quality , provide work coronal restoration place . Failure endodontic treatment evidence recent persistent clinical radiological sign LEO and/or symptom tooth root canal filling inadequate , orthograde retreatment offer favorable riskbenefit ratio surgery option . Pulpotomy primary molar child ( 3 12 year ) Molar present deep carious lesion without irreversible pulpal disease , molar stay dental arch least 3 year . Pulp exposure excision carious lesion temporary molar present irreversible pulp disease . The molar stay dental arch least 3 year . Apexification child ( 7 18 year ) + adults Permanent immature singleroot tooth suffer periodontal dentoalveolar injury cause pulp necrosis without periapical disease ( LEO ) child , teenager adult patient .
