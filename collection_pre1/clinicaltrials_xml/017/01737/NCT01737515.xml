	<brief_summary>Despite advance surgical technique , preoperative patient evaluation post-operative care , elective colorectal surgery carry risk mortality approximately 2 % morbidity rate range 20-40 % . Risk prediction important two reason : informs decision-making individual case surgery ( part inform consent ) allow comparison actual outcome predict outcome . A number score system assess risk death surgery develop . They vary simple score base variable highly complex mathematical model require detail data input . Recently , Association Fran√ßaise de Chirurgie conduct multicentre study develop validate 4-item predictive score mortality colorectal resection good predictive value simple use . Although many surgeon associate obesity adverse outcome , recent large , well-designed study unable show obesity ( define Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 ) independent risk factor major morbidity mortality general abdominal surgery . Recently abdominal obesity ( waist measurement &gt; 102cm men &gt; 88cm woman ) show good correlation cardiovascular disease BMI strongly associate cluster risk factor cardiovascular disease diabetes ( insulin resistance , hyperglycaemia , hypertension , dyslipidaemia abdominal obesity ) know metabolic syndrome . Waist circumference waist/hip ratio measure abdominal obesity correlate amount intra-abdominal rather subcutaneous general body fat may better measure risk intra-operative complication post-operative morbidity follow abdominal surgery BMI . The study prospective multicentred , 28 participate unit Belgium , France , Switzerland Sweden . The coordinate centre UCL St Luc . The study start 1st September 2008 aim include minimum 1000 patient . Consecutive patient undergo elective colorectal resectional surgery cancer diverticulitis include . In addition normal preoperative assessment , waist hip circumference measure surgery specific data collect intra post-operative complication mortality . Data record use encrypt , anonymous database use variable carefully select ass short long term outcome . The study first kind investigate abdominal obesity predictive risk factor colorectal surgery also one big prospective study morbidity colorectal surgery . The aim study ) ass waist measurement waist/hip ratio well predictive risk factor complication mortality colorectal surgery BMI , b ) measurement add accuracy AFC score risk prediction .</brief_summary>
