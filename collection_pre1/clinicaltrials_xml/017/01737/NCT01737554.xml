	<brief_summary>Catheter occlusion dysfunction common complication central venous access device ( CVAD ) use child cancer hematologic disorder . These event lead interruption therapy may require device removal replacement . Attempts clear occlusion cause device fracture . There clear link catheter occlusion serious complication include bloodstream infection intravascular thrombosis . There evidence catheter occlusion dysfunction may precede subclinical catheter narrowing , could detect accurate measurement catheter resistance . This study aim observe describe feasibility result catheter resistance monitoring ( CRM ) time aim prospectively identify patient high risk catheter occlusion . If CRM feasible prof sensitive specific , could provide opportunity preemptive therapy prevent occlusion , might also prevent bloodstream infection thrombosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Resistance Monitoring Predict Catheter-Associated Adverse Events Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weekly measurement catheter resistance determine use Alaris® Syringe Module ( Carefusion Inc. , San Diego , USA ) , commercially available , FDA-approved intravenous ( IV ) pump able deliver accurate flow-rates obtain accurate pressure measurement . The inline pressure measure multiple flow-rates resistance estimate gradient pressure-flow curve . Primary Objective - To describe feasibility weekly CRM child adolescent treat St. Jude . Secondary Objectives - To describe patient caregiver adherence weekly CRM child adolescent treat St. Jude . - To explore correlation result CRM catheter occlusion dysfunction .</detailed_description>
