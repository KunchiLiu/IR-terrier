	<brief_summary>Emergence agitation ( EA ) occur 67 % pediatric patient anesthesia bilateral myringotomy tube ( BMT , `` ear tube '' ) . The goal study find whether acetaminophen give well surgery decrease pain therefore , decrease emergence agitation well acetaminophen give shortly surgery . EA dangerous patient may hard monitor vital sign important phase recovery , may injure , may require presence extra staff , distress parent . Causes EA well understood , worsen pain . 70 % patient undergoing BMT experience pain need treatment . Intranasal fentanyl , strong analgesic , show decrease EA , often end dose-dependent nausea vomit . In previous study common practice , acetaminophen give either 30 minute induction anesthesia immediately induction . The peak analgesic effect acetaminophen 60-120 minute . Since procedure generally complete 5-10 minute , therapeutic effect acetaminophen may present upon emergence anesthesia . The purpose study find acetaminophen give 60-120 minute prior emergence decrease EA patient undergo BMT . Patients would randomize one three group : Control receive acetaminophen rectally anesthesia ( standard practice ) , Group 1 receive acetaminophen 10 mg/kg 60-120 minute prior surgery , Group 2 receive acetaminophen 20 mg/kg 60-120 minute prior surgery . All group would also receive dose intranasal fentanyl surgery , standard practice . Patients would observe recovery room various time point evidence EA pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Emergence agitation ( EA ) occur 67 % patient undergoing Sevoflurane anesthesia bilateral myringotomy tube placement ( BMT ) . Often EA present inconsolable screaming , cry , thrash , kick , may require restraint . It dangerous patient may difficult monitor vital sign critical phase recovery ( i.e . unable detect hypoxemia ) , may injure thrash , usually require presence extra staff , distress parent . Causes EA theoretical , exacerbate pain . 70 % patient undergoing BMT pain require treatment . Since BMT perform without IV placement option analgesia limited intranasal fentanyl , intramuscular ketorolac , rectal oral acetaminophen , oral opioids ( i.e . codeine , oxycodone ) . Intranasal Fentanyl show decrease EA , result post operative nausea vomiting , opioids . Intramuscular ketorolac costly lead hematoma . In previous study ( common practice ) , acetaminophen give either 30 minute induction ( PO route ) immediately induction ( PR route ) . Since procedure generally complete 5-10 minute , therapeutic effect acetaminophen appreciate . The peak effect ( analgesia ) acetaminophen 60-120 minute . Our hypothesis : If acetaminophen give 60-120 minute prior emergence , reach therapeutic effect , decrease EA patient undergo BMT . The importance mitigate EA involve patient safety satisfaction , also impact hospital/surgery center efficiency ( RN staff smoother short recovery period ) . This study randomize control trial . Potential subject identify recruit study personnel and/or patient 's surgeon . Children schedule BMT placement whose parent ' consent participate enrol study . These patient consent day surgery . Parents inform whether enroll child study , receive standard clinical care . Only subject meeting inclusion criterion requirement continuation study consent . Patients enrol one three study group . All patient meet inclusion criterion requirement study ( see ) identify , consent computer randomize either control , group 1 2 . Control - acetaminophen PR ( 20-40mg/kg ) induction Anesthesia ( acetaminophen suppository form give rectally ) Group 1 - acetaminophen PO ( 10mg/kg ) 60-120min start BMT placement ( acetaminophen syrup form give mouth ) Group 2 - acetaminophen PO ( 20mg/kg ) 60-120min start BMT placement ( acetaminophen syrup form give mouth ) After randomization , treat physician make aware treatment group patient assign . The data collection behavior/pain assessment make blind study personnel operate room ( induction ) PACU . Data Collection : Data collect time point : Induction , Emergence ( spontaneous extremity movement ) , every 5 minute emergence patient discharge . There also follow-up questionnaire parent satisfaction child 's emergence , side effect , additional medication , his/her PACU experience . This conduct phone within 36 hour parent leave hospital .</detailed_description>

Patients take medication cause drowsiness alter mental status ( eg . benzodiazepine , cough suppressant , diphenhydramine ) Patients significant history psychiatric illness , neurologic disease ( seizure disorder require medication therapy ) , developmental delay . Patients premedicated . Patients undergoing procedure would prolong anesthetic exposure confound postoperative pain . Intraop complication would require prolonged anesthetic exposure . If patient take acetaminophen prior surgery suppose Patients receive ketorolac additional analgesia surgery . Patients liver disease .</criteria>
