	<brief_title>Activity Safety Study BKM120 Monotherapy Patient With Metastatic Head Neck Cancer Recurrent Progressive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BKM120 PI3K inhibitor . The PI3K/Protein kinase B ( AKT ) signal pathway deregulation frequently observe Head neck cancer . In addition role tumor genesis , PI3K/AKT pathway seem involve resistance cetuximab . In context , study proposal evaluate clinical interest monotherapy PI3K inhibitor ( BKM120 , Novartis ) patient metastatic head neck cancer refractory relapse platin cetuximab based- chemotherapy . Since resistance cetuximab result phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutation , PIK3CA amplification mutation upstream PI3K pathway , BKM120 activity evaluate two parallel independent cohort patient : patient present PI3KCA mutation patient without PI3KCA mutation .</detailed_description>
