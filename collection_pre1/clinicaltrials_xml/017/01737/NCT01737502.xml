	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose auranofin plus sirolimus least one line platinum base chemotherapy lung cancer ( squamous , ras-mutated adenocarcinoma , small cell lung cancer ) patient acceptable standard treatment option . ( Phase I ) II . To assess progression-free survival four month patient treat auranofin least one line platinum base chemotherapy lung cancer ( squamous , ras-mutated adenocarcinoma , small cell lung cancer ) patient acceptable standard treatment option . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival population comparison recent historical control . II . To determine adverse event ( AE ) profile safety regimen . III . To determine overall response rate , per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , duration tumor response patient measurable disease . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relationship molecular correlate progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , response adverse event . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study auranofin follow phase II study . Patients receive auranofin orally ( PO ) day 1-28 sirolimus PO day 1-28 ( day 8-28 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
