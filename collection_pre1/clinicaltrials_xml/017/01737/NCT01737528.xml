	<brief_title>STS/ACC Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry ( TVT Registry )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Registry The TVT Registry design support national surveillance system assess characteristic , treatment , outcomes patient receive transcutaneous valve therapy . Patient-level data submit participate hospital The Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) American College Cardiology Foundation 's ( ACCF ) joint TVT Registry . The purpose TVT Registry include : ( ) collect pertinent standardize data element participate hospital , health care providers others measure ass quality care patient receive TVT ; ( ii ) provide confidential periodic report participate hospital , health care provider others , evaluate improve quality care area ; ( iii ) permit foster appropriate research base upon data collect mean TVT Registry . The secondary aim TVT Registry serve scalable data infrastructure post market study . Background Significance Transcatheter valve therapy emerge clinical practice research phase United States . The first several approach replace aortic valve without open-chest surgery become reality . Other valve delivery system expect approved upcoming year . An Expert Consensus Document Transcatheter Valve Therapy outline initial technology , target patient population , multidisciplinary heart team specialize facility need . The document also propose establishment national registry patient valvular heart disease collect analyze data new valve treatment option become available . Surveillance device performance , monitor long-term outcome , performance comparative effectiveness research propose use registry . Transcatheter valve therapy emerge unmet patient need . Furthermore , TVT develop time degenerative heart valve diseases mitral aortic valve increase frequency population age . With introduction first TAVR commercial product , targeted patient group `` inoperable '' patient receive traditional therapy surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) . It expect TAVR subsequently extend patient high risk SAVR . The marked reduction mortality TAVR inoperable patient similar mortality TAVR versus SAVR high risk patient provide patient new therapy benefit also different risk profile . Patients family need make informed decision regard likelihood mortality benefit , improve functional class quality life , suffer complication , choose different care option therapeutic approach . For patient unique issue prioritization health relate quality life versus quantity life , desire preserve independence avoid become burden family , need clearly understand current condition reversible versus irreversible link condition age . These issue become highlighted consider considerable cost treatment burden TVT technology versus disable symptom recurrent hospitalization cause untreated severe valvular heart disease .</detailed_description>
