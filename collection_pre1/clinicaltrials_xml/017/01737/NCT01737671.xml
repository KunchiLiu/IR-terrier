	<brief_title>Methotrexate Infusion Into Fourth Ventricle Children With Malignant Fourth Ventricular Brain Tumors : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter Placement : If eligible take part study , surgery place catheter ommaya reservoir . The ommaya reservoir catheter system allow drug administer directly part brain . In study , catheter use collect 1 teaspoon cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF - fluid surround brain spinal cord ) check status disease infusion methotrexate directly 4th ventricle brain , 1 4 connect fluid-filled cavity brain . If study doctor think necessary , base location tumor , tumor may also remove already anesthesia catheter place . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 4 day long consist 4 daily infusion methotrexate . You least 2 week rest period cycle . Methotrexate infuse ommaya reservoir catheter directly 4th ventricle brain start least 7 day catheter placement surgery . The infusion last 3 minute time . You may also give leucovorin , drug use help prevent treat side effect methotrexate , intravenous ( IV ) infusion catheter port already place arm . If study doctor think need , infusion give cycle help possible side effect may experience methotrexate . The infusion last 5 minute time . Study Visits : Within 72 hour catheter placement surgery : - Any updates health record . - You MRI scan brain spine check status disease flow brain fluid . Within seven ( 7 ) day catheter placement surgery : - Any updates health record . - You neurological exam . - You spinal tap ( also call lumbar puncture ) . A lumbar puncture procedure fluid surround spinal cord remove insert needle low back . The affected area numb local anesthetic procedure . - You neuropsychological test perform neuropsychologist . For test , ask question test memory brain function . The test take 3 hour . On Day 1 methotrexate infusion Cycles 1-3 : - You neurological exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - If able become pregnant , urine pregnancy test . Daily methotrexate infusion Cycles 1-3 : - You neurological exam . - You Ommaya reservoir tap ( catheter place Ommaya reservoir give methotrexate infusion ) . - CSF ( 1 teaspoon ) collect routine test . Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn learn much methotrexate blood . After complete Cycle 3 : You MRI scan brain spine check status disease flow brain fluid . You spinal tap . You neuropsychological test perform neuropsychologist . For test , ask question test memory brain function . The test take 3 hour . If study doctor think best interest , continue additional cycle methotrexate therapy , require test procedure . Your doctor may recommend additional surgery . Your doctor discus . Also , study doctor think best interest , methotrexate may give together chemotherapy completion Cycle 3 . If receive chemotherapy , study doctor speak detail drug receive receive . Length Study : You receive 3 cycle methotrexate , long doctor think best interest . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visit : 3 month final dose study drug : - Any updates health record . - You neurological exam . - You MRI scan brain spine check status disease . This investigational study . Methotrexate FDA approve commercially available infusion directly brain tumor . The infusion methotrexate 4th ventricle brain investigational . Up 12 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . There twostep process eligibility assessment : Step 1 : Eligibility catheter placement possible surgical removal tumor . Step 2 : Eligibility methotrexate infusion . 2 . Step 1 Eligibility ( PreOperative Eligibility ) Includes : Diagnosis Age Patients tumor originally locate within posterior fossa brain : *Patients ≤ age 21 year recurrent medulloblastoma ( PNET ) involve brain and/or spine *Patients ≤ age 21 year recurrent ependymoma involve brain and/or spine *Patients ≤ age 21 year recurrent atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor ( AT/RT ) involve brain and/or spine . 3 . Step 1 Elig . : Life Expectancy Patients must life expectancy least 12 week estimate treat oncologist neurosurgeon consider enrollment . 4 . Step 1 Elig : Central Nervous System Function Patients may enrol study alter neurological status , somnolence , attribute hydrocephalus and/or mass effect brain tumor treat physician . However , tumor resection placement catheter fourth ventricle , protocol continue patient adequate central nervous system function , define : patient severely somnolent comatose adequate clinical performance status define protocol section 3.2.2.1 . 5 . Step 2 Elig . ( MTX Infusion Elig . ) : Clinical Performance Status Patients must Lansky score 50 great ≤ 16 year age Karnofsky score 50 great &gt; 16 year age eligible enrollment ( See Protocol Section 14.1 Lansky PlayPerformance Scale information ; See Protocol Section 14.2 Karnofsky Performance Scale information ) . 6 . Step 2 Elig : Pregnancy Female patient postmenarchal must negative pregnancy test eligible . Pregnant lactate female patient ineligible . 7 . Step 2 Elig : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . a. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Must receive within 2 week entry onto study . b. Hematopoietic Growth Factors : At least 7 day since completion therapy growth factor . c. Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day since completion therapy biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . These patient must discuss study chair case case basis . 8 . Step 2 Elig : Bone Marrow Function patient must adequate bone marrow function , define : . Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/µL b. Platelet count ≥ 30,000/µL ( transfusion independent ) c. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 gm/dL ( may receive RBC transfusion ) d. Postop CSF flow study show reestablishment CSF flow . 9 . All patient and/or parent legal guardian must sign write informed consent . 1 . Patients exclude study currently enrol another experimental treatment protocol . 2 . Patients exclude study evidence infection , site , time consider enrollment .</criteria>
