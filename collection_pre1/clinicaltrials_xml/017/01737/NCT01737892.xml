	<brief_summary>This study examine pharmacokinetic profile Armstrong 's proposed Epinephrine Inhalation Aerosol USP , HFA-MDI ( E004 ) , use stable isotope deuterium-labeled epinephrine ( epinephrine-d3 ) differentiate administer drug endogenous epinephrine , healthy male female adult volunteer . The current study design complement earlier PK study , API-E004-CL-B , thorough evaluation E004 PK . Safety E004 also evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Evaluation Pharmacokinetic Profile E004 Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , evaluator-blind , single dose , two-arm , crossover , PK study , conduct ~18 healthy , male female , adult volunteer . PK study use E004-d3 125 mcg per inhalation ( Arm T ) . A previously market Epinephrine CFC-MDI , label `` For Investigational Use Only '' use Reference Control ( Arm C ) . The main feature study design : ( 1 ) All candidate must screen must satisfy enrollment criterion . All enrolled subject participate two Study Visits , correspond two randomized treatment . Each Study Visit consist pre-dose baseline assessment post-dose evaluation 6 hour . ( 2 ) It important minimize physical psychological disturbance endogenous epinephrine concentration study subject , study visit . All subject must maintain recline recumbent rest position entire Study Visit , physical activity restrict minimum necessity bathroom trip study activity . Caffeine-containing ( include de-caffeinated ) food beverage prohibit . Physical exercise , unnecessary physical activity , video game prohibit throughout study visit . ( 3 ) At Screening Visit begin Study Visit , subject train correct self-administration MDI , use simulation MDI unit contain active drug . The following two randomized treatment self-administered two Study Visits : Treatment T : Two ( 2 ) inhalation E004-d3 ( 125 mcg/inhalation ) , total 250 mcg epinephrine-d3 ; Treatment C : Two ( 2 ) inhalation Epinephrine CFC-MDI ( 220 mcg/inhalation , total 440 mcg epinephrine base equivalent ) . ( 4 ) PK blood sample take vein hand arm via indwell anticoagulated IV catheter , venipuncture , schedule time point predose baseline ( within 30 minute dose ) , 2±1 , 5±1 , 7.5±1 , 10±1 , 12.5 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 240 360 minute postdose . The total volume blood take per subject shall exceed 500 mL 30-day period . Study visit schedule may adjust avoid overdraw blood 30-day period . ( 5 ) At PK sample point , blood sample ( ~ 5mL ) , collect ice-chilled potassium-EDTA sample tube , contain pre-added 1 % ( V : V ) 1.0 M sodium metabisulfite solution antioxidant . Sample tube label sample ID # ( consist subject ID # , Study Visit # , sample # ) . The sample tube keep ice refrigerate , centrifuge within 60 minute collection . The harvested plasma sample tube transfer , store , 2 storage tube , respectively , frozen NMT -20 degrees C analysis . ( 6 ) PK sample analyze establish LC/MS/MS method , quantitative detection limit 5 pg/mL , epinephrine-d3 ( MW=186 ) epinephrine ( MW=183 ) . ( 7 ) Safety parameter adverse drug event , , monitor document study visit . An End-of-Study ( EOS ) safety evaluation conduct end , within 7 day , Study Visit-2 .</detailed_description>
