	<brief_summary>This study look blood cerebrospinal fluid consent participant either early stage multiple sclerosis ( clinically isolate syndrome ) later stage ( secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ) , participant neurological autoimmune illness . Biomarkers microRNA assess group difference .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assess microRNA Biomarkers Early Later Stage Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis chronic autoimmune disorder central nervous system . While current immunomodulatory therapy show efficacious early stage MS , therapies less potent later phase MS. We look magnetic resonance image gadolinium measure active disease detect axonal degeneration . Therefore , need identify biomarkers may use diagnose MS predict disease progression . Biomarkers find cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) closer proximity inflammatory lesion site sensitive . This pilot study seek characterize difference microRNA profile cell product early later stag MS , hope microRNA profile could correlate clinical CSF inflammation index . CSF obtain 45 participant .</detailed_description>
