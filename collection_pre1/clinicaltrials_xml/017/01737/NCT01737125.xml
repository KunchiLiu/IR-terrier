	<brief_summary>The distal tibio-fibular joint ( DTFJ ) integral part ankle injury make gravity , forecast complexity ankle fracture treatment . It 's classically describe known radiological point view , static incidence anatomical study . To knowledge dynamic dimension model miss . Our study use high spatial-resolution MRI acquisition obtain best possible definition DTFJ especially associate MRI acquisition movement , use typical fast sequence `` TrueFISP `` `` FLASH '' allow precise model joint physiological movement biomechanics healthy subject invasive method . This analysis make simple movement flexion extension , possible movement ankle block corresponds clinical situation osteosynthesis ankle immobilized post-operative dynamic rehabilitation shoe Axmed ® It associate '' effort test `` reproduction subject joint load MRI joint movement control This test make ankle fix 90 ° flexion reproduces post-operative clinical situationThe meditative data associate anatomical biomechanical study ankle present syndesmosis injury repair accord classic protocol use department , compare data literature optimize technique repair joint . Indeed gold standard surgical technique Main PurposeTo understand , observe , analyze quantify joint movement simple movement ankle extension flexion , simulation axial load mime walk fix 90 ° post-operative . Secondary purpose - Modelling DTFJ- Modify post-operative care hypothesis load lead abnormal movement DTFJ ankle fix 90 ° ( post-operative clinical condition ) . - Validate technique repair joint compare data MRI anatomical mechanical test</brief_summary>
