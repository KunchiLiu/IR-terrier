	<brief_summary>The UKGPCS set find genetic alteration occur patient prostate cancer . A man 's risk develop prostate cancer increase first-degree relative ( father brother ) diagnose prostate cancer young age . This look men affect young age family history prostate cancer , since probable prostate cancer due inherit genetic cause rather environmental cause . We also ask men come Royal Marsden Hospital treat prostate cancer would like take part study also look see find genetic alteration old men , family history prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study : Epidemiology Molecular Genetics Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide two part : 1 . The Study The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust , London Sutton : The study offer every patient attend prostate clinic The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust , London Sutton . This call 'The Systematic Study ' . Patients approach clinic give information sheet study also explain verbally . They ask 18ml blood ask fill family history epidemiological questionnaire . Those treatment also ask 18ml blood serum plasma marker study . Those patient one relative affect PrCa one ≤ 65 year diagnosis total 3 relative PrCa age , ask relative approach ask give blood sample DNA analysis PrCa predisposition gene tumour sample molecular analysis PrCa predisposition behaviour outline . Where relatives PrCa decease , pathology record tumour block request obtain detail treat via index case . Consent Consent seek prospectively living individual accrue study January 2006 access medical record tumour block . This study active since 1992 blood sample inform consent PrCa predisposition gene study . Outside tumour block pathological sample inform consent molecular study . Many The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust PrCa tumour sample also consent clause operation consent form use time 'material remove may use research purpose ' . Some tissue collect local hospital auspex previous protocol consent form explicitly state separate consent use tissue time , although part approve protocol . Many patient decease . It therefore propose tissue medical record data collect retrospectively analyse anonymously result feed back patient would impact upon care . An exception result study blood finding PrCa predisposition gene could implications relative . Those patient still live previously take part study 1992 present take part environmental questionnaire part study invite take part part study . New consent obtain . 2 . The Study Collaborative Centres throughout UK . Many via NCRN network . This conduct Study The Royal Marsden except study explain verbally patient interested , detail give study office confidential fax study office send patient information sheet consent form . Furthermore , group patient eligible part study ( ) men PrCa present young age ( ≤ 60 year ) ( b ) PrCa first-degree related pair one ≤ 65 year diagnosis ( c ) total 3 relative PrCa age The two part ( 1 ) ( 2 ) call UKGPCS ( UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study ) . There currently 300 collaborator UK-wide participate auspex previous protocol ( previously , The Cancer Research UK/British Prostate Group//British Association Urological Surgeons Section Oncology NCRN Familial Prostate Cancer Study ) . Proposed analysis sample The sample use find PrCa predisposition gene use linkage analysis . These investigation solely research find prostate cancer-predisposing gene result would convey patient gene ( ) find . If gene ( ) find , patient genetic test abnormality gene without prior genetic counselling would newly take blood sample . Only patient wish ( stated consent form ) inform research finding contact . If occurs 6 month last contact patient , would via GP . Data correlate medical record treatment outcome find genetic alteration associate prostate cancer development and/or prognosis . Tumour material collect store -70oC freezer space currently available The Institute Cancer Research . Tumour also store RNA later paraffin embed tumour make tissue microarrays section cut . This use molecular biology analysis . Cases relative may flag cancer registry confirm diagnosis prostate cancer , date death cause death . This do via Medical Research Information Service ( MRIS ) , use record maintain The NHS Information Centre NHS Central Register . Clinical detail collect routinely part medical care clinical follow record patient prostate cancer include disease parameter ( e.g . stage , grade ) treatment outcome ( e.g . survival data , side effect treatment ) . We also request follow-up data , approximately 2 year patient consent , record relapse , treatment survival data occur since diagnosis . We link genetic finding clinical data try identify genetic marker disease parameter ( e.g . predict poor prognosis bad late toxicity treatment radiotherapy ) . These data would analyse anonymously link clinical genetic datasets . No result would feedback participant . We supply anonymised data EU dataset ( Genepi study ) . This would central database manage auspex GCP would anonymised data . No individual would identifiable holder Genepi database .</detailed_description>
