	<detailed_description>Aging major risk factor development type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . Approximately 50 % subject age ≥65 diabetes impaired glucose tolerance , pre-diabetic state . Skeletal muscle main site insulin-stimulated glucose disposal age characterized muscle insulin resistance . It suggest insulin resistance age result age-related accumulation intramyocellular lipid impair insulin action . However , molecular basis accumulation intramyocellular fat insulin resistance elderly remain unknown . AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) energy-sensing enzyme whose activation result increase fatty acid oxidation . Purpose : In propose study , test hypothesis decrease fat oxidation occur muscle old human subject secondary age-mediated reduction AMPK signaling , vivo , upregulating AMPK signal exercise training result ( correlate ) increase fat oxidation , reduce intramyocellular lipid , improve insulin action . Using primary human muscle cell culture system , also test hypothesis reduce AMPK signal old myotubes lead low fat oxidation ( vitro ) chemical activation AMPK old myotubes level young muscle cell restore insulin action help prevent fat-induced insulin resistance . To test hypothesis follow specific aim ( objective ) propose : Specific Aim 1 ) To determine whether reduced AMPK signal muscle old subject , vivo , associate low fat oxidation rate insulin resistance , whether physical activity improve glucose homeostasis old subject upregulating AMPK signal muscle . We test hypothesis ( ) reduction AMPK signal muscle old subject associate ( predict ) low fat oxidation rate insulin resistance , vivo ; ( ii ) training-induced increase AMPK signal old subject associate ( predict ) increase fat oxidation , reduction intramyocellular lipid , improvement insulin action/sensitivity . Specific Aim 2 ) To determine whether age-related decline AMPK signal involved reduction fat oxidation insulin resistance occur age . Using vitro primary muscle cell culture system , test hypothesis ( ) reduce AMPK signal myotubes old subject lead decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation ; ( ii ) reduce AMPK signal fat oxidation myotubes old subject result increase susceptibility fat-induced insulin resistance . Specific Aim 3 ) To examine whether age-related reduction fat oxidation insulin sensitivity old muscle cell reverse upregulating AMPK signal . We test hypothesis chemical activation AMPK old myotubes ( vitro ) level young muscle cell restore insulin signal help prevent fat-induced insulin resistance .</detailed_description>
