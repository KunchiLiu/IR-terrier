	<brief_summary>Pain follow abdominal surgery manage use thoracic epidural analgesia ( TEA ) epidural insert spine level scapula The risk due TEA include difficulty insertion , failure 40 % patient perioperative period , fall blood pressure rare devastate complication paralysis either due bleeding infection . Injury spinal cord also fear complication . Therefore alternative technique need evaluate . Paravertebral block ( PVB ) document provide pain relief follow abdominal surgery use early technique pose risk puncture cover lung ( pleura ) result pneumothorax . The current technique involve use curled catheter insert use ultrasonography lie outside pleura nerve travel thus reduce chance pneumothorax catheter migration . Objective current study compare efficacy safety bilateral PVB TEA . Patients undergo bowel surgery randomize receive thoracic epidural analgesia bilateral thoracic paravertebral block . Pain score rest coughing , failure complication rate compare two group . Objective : The objective investigator determine whether ultrasound ( US ) -guided bilateral thoracic paravertebral block ( PVB ) use curled catheter provide effective post-operative analgesia compare thoracic epidural analgesia patient undergo open abdominal bowel surgery . The primary outcome study pain score first 24 hour follow open bowel surgery . Secondary outcome include 1 . Analgesic consumption perioperative period , 2 . Block relate data ( block performance time , success rate , extent sensory block , complication ) 3 . Hemodynamic parameter every 6 hourly 4 . Incidence side effect like nausea pruritus score , time return bowel activity Hypothesis Null Hypothesis : Primary . Paravertebral block provide equal analgesia early postoperative period ( first 24 hour surgery ) compare thoracic epidural analgesia patient undergo bowel surgery laparotomy . Secondary 1 . The analgesic consumption PVB TEA different first 24 hour follow surgery 2 . The block performance time , success rate extent sensory block PVB different TEA . 3 . Side effect complication follow bilateral PVB different occur TEA</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 70 patient ASA physical status 1 3 , schedule elective bowel surgery laparotomy deem suitable receive either thoracic paravertebral epidural analgesia include study . Recruitment take place preoperative clinic . Written inform consent participation study obtain visit preadmission clinic preparation area least 2 hour prior surgery . They randomize one two group prior block procedure use close envelope system . All patient educate regard VRS score scale 0 10 0 pain 10 bad pain ever experience . All patient receive perioperative multimodal analgesia use naproxen , gabapentin acetaminophen . All block perform block room use standard monitoring , sterile precaution titrate intravenous sedation fentanyl midazolam . During block performance one anesthetist one assistant present . Due necessity handle equipment staff blind . All patient receive supplemental oxygen . Group 1 : Group 1 receive catheter congruent TEA . The catheter insert use ultrasound ass level well best space insert epidural catheter T7 T9 . The epidural space identify use loss resistance technique . After test dose rule intravascular intrathecal placement catheter use 3mL 2 % lidocaine 5mcg/mL epinephrine , initial block make 0.25 % bupivacaine 5 mL follow 3 mL aliquot administer every 5 minute establish block T8 T12 . An infusion start 8 mL/hour 0.1 % bupivacaine 10 microgram/mL dilaudid continue 72 hour . Additional nurse administer bolus 5-10mL standard solution allow via epidural catheter every 6hourly need pain control follow increase basal infusion rate maximum 14mL/hr . Patients allow self-administer additional bolus 3mL standard infusate every 20minutes ( PCEA ) per standard practice hospital . Time initiate block failure document . If block fails , patient receive intravenous PCA dilaudid patient drop study efficacy data . Group 2 bilateral PVB catheter insert use ultrasound . Patients prone position receive intravenous sedation similar Group 1 . The T8 spine identify mark count lumbar area . A high-frequency linear ultrasound probe position T8/9 intercostal space transverse process pleura field well internal intercostal membrane . ( 2.5 cm lateral spinous process ) Using ultrasound guidance in-plane approach , 17 gauge Tuohy needle connect 15 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine via extension tube inserted puncture internal intercostal membrane . Injection local anesthetic push pleura away , end point needle position ( current standard technique investigator institution ) . A curved pigtail catheter insert observe delivery extrapleurally 5mL local anesthetic inject observe movement pleura . A similar procedure do contralateral side level . The catheter secure skin cover dermabond tegaderm . Following , 0.2 % ropivacaine infuse rate 7 mlLhr via catheter next 72 hour post-operatively . They also receive intravenous patient control analgesia dilaudid dose 0.2mg lock 6 min . Additional nurse administer bolus 5-10mL ropivacaine 0.2 % via paravetebral catheter permit every 6 hourly side maximal pain . The position catheter confirm routine post-operative chest x ray follow injection contrast ( Isovue : 2 mL ) . The sensory block extent document 15 minute initial injection prior move patient OR . Time initiate block failure rate document . US image paravertebral space LA injection ( IIM : internal intercostal membrane ; TP : transverse process ; LA : local anesthetic ) As soon arterial line insert operating room monitoring purpose , 10mL blood collect measure plasma ropivacaine level . This measurement repeat arrival PACU along routine postoperative arterial blood gas analysis . Plasma ropivacaine level measure postoperative day 1 6AM blood drawn along routine postoperative blood work ( venous sample ) Cases failure establish block 30 minute local anesthetic injection consider block failure patient exclude efficacy part study . These patient receive intravenous patient control analgesia . Once effectiveness level block confirm patient move operating room surgery standardize general anesthesia use fentanyl 2-3Âµg/Kg , propofol 2 mg/kg rocuronium 0.8-1.0 mg/kg intubation follow maintenance desflurane air-oxygen mixture . Vasopressors ( Ephedrine phenylephrine ) administer need control hemodynamics total dose use record . The patient assess pain rest coughing/activity immediately surgery , every 15 minute first 2 hr 6 hourly thereafter 24 hour removal epidural block catheter . Patients whose VRS score high 5/10 PACU , apart get bolus epidural PVB may also receive IV Hydromorphone 0.2 mg every 5 minute till pain subsides score 3/10 . Nausea document use categorical scale ( none , mild , moderate severe ) , pruritus score record every 12 hour ( categorical scale , none , mild , moderate severe ) . Time onset bowel sound , time first flatus time first bowel movement would also record time 0 arrival time PACU . Post-operative hemodynamic change , blood pressure urine output document every 6 hour . Duration significant hypotension compute nursing chart , significant hypotension systolic BP le 90 mm Hg . Patient satisfaction document visual analogue scale 0 totally dissatisfied 100 totally satisfied . Adverse event local anesthetic toxicity , wound infection , dehiscence , urinary retention , cognitive dysfunction neurological deficit prospectively collect . The failure rate technique number attempt also record . This open label study document effectiveness bilateral PVB bowel surgery . The investigator plan double blind study follow present study result encourage . The second concern 2 different local anesthetic use 2 limbs equianalgesic concentration infusion .</detailed_description>
