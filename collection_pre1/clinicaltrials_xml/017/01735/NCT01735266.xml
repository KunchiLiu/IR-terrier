	<brief_summary>In situation , leave colon ( especially SD junction ) consider difficult part colonoscopy , endoscopist may encounter difficulty scope insertion patient may feel pain uncomfortable . It suggest half whole time scope insertion use leave colon . Many method , water immersion , abdominal palpation , use facilitate insertion leave colon . Colonoscopy whole-colon water exchange method show useful reduce medication use , pain experience colonoscopy , increase success rate cecum intubation adenoma detection rate sedate unsedated patient undergo screen colonoscopy . Exchange water scope insertion minimize loop formation prevents lengthen distension colon colonoscopy . This facilitate colonoscopy average difficult colonoscopy . However , know whether benefit water exchange method colonoscopy mainly due effect leave colon . We hypothesize left-colon water exchange colonoscopy ( LWE ) may similar effect regard maximal pain score mean pain score unsedated patient compare whole-colon water exchange colonoscopy ( WWE ) . At mean time , LWE may reduce insertion time compare WWE . Here perform prospective , randomize control study investigate efficacy whole-colon water exchange , left-colon water exchange air method colonoscopy pain score insertion time unsedated outpatient .</brief_summary>
