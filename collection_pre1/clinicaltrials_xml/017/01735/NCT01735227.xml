	<brief_title>Omeprazole Pantoprazole Antiplatelet Effect Clopidogrel Clinical Trials ( OPEN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through number large-scale clinical trial , Meta analysis , clinical treatment guideline confirm clopidogrel aspirin dual antiplatelet treatment strategy acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) stent implantation surgery patient vital role . It effectively suppress acute 縲《ubacute stent thrombosis formation , reduce readmission ratio , thus greatly improve quality life patient . A large number clinical practice report , although treatment strategy reduce incidence adverse cardiovascular event , increase possibility occurrence gastrointestinal bleeding complication . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) often use prevent gastrointestinal complication dual antiplatelet therapy . 2008 American College Cardiology ( ACC ) / American Society Gastroenterology ( ACG ) / American Heart Association ( AHA ) jointly issue consensus document , consistently recommend majority clinician application dual antiplatelet PPIs treatment patient risk factor gastrointestinal bleeding may exist time , order reduce occurrence gastrointestinal adverse event . But home abroad recent year , report suggest interaction PPIs clopidogrel may exist , thereby reduce latter 's anti- platelet effect , order make incidence adverse CV event increase 25-64 % . In January 2009 , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) announce safety review earlier report potential interaction two type drug , particularly stress need carry large number clinical practice research clear interaction . PPIs antiplatelet effect clopidogrel PCI yet clear , clinical result interaction still exist many different academic perspective research defect , still need arouse sufficient attention , continue carry relevant field research . In order clarify interaction PPIs clopidogrel anti - platelet effect , investigator design clinical randomized control trial omeprazole pantoprazole antiplatelet effect clopidogrel .In experiment , investigator take randomized NSTE-ACS hospitalize patient meet inclusion criterion randomly divide omeprazole pantoprazole group . On day admission , patient take clopidogrel load dose 300mg + aspirin 300mg subsequent maintenance dose clopidogrel 75mg + aspirin 300mg omeprazole group take omeprazole 20mg / , pantoprazole group take pantoprazole 20mg / d. Respectively , day admission ( medication ) , medication 12-24 hour , medication 72 hour , 30 day , take early morning fast venous blood , measure AA 縲、DP - induced platelet aggregation . And select 30 day , 6 month 12 month record patient 's clinical adverse event ( include death , myocardial infarction , revascularization , stent thrombosis , recurrent angina , rehospitalization due cardiovascular disease , bleed event ) . To assess impact PPIs clopidogrel antiplatelet effect observe 1 year follow-up result , explore optimal combination dual anti-platelet joint PPIs course treatment , appropriate dosage best time provide reasonable clinical program create personalize treatment system , improve patient 's quality life .</detailed_description>
