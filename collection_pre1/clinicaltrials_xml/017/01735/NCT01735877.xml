The currently available treatment unilateral neglect scan training , visual cuing approach , limb activation strategy , visual imagery , tactile stimulation , prism sustain attention training.Mirror therapy improve hand function sub-acute stroke . Hypothesis : To evaluate effectiveness Mirror therapy management stroke patient unilateral neglect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Mirror Therapy Stroke Patients With Unilateral Neglect - A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 30 - 50 % stroke patient leave considerable residual deficit . The post stroke disability due loss locomotion activity daily live , cognition communication skills.Hemispatial neglect report association damage several different cerebral structure large-scale distributed neurocognitive network.Mirror therapy improve hand function sub-acute stroke . It also help recovery neglect stroke patient . But little consensus exist whether one treatment efficacious others many study fail document duration treatment effect generalization daily activity . The aim study evaluate effectiveness limb activation MT limb activation strategy alone management stroke patient unilateral neglect make patient functional activity daily live .</detailed_description>
