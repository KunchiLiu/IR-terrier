	<brief_title>Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Introduction The role human polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMNs ) acute inflammatory response well document . PMNs play fundamental role innate immune response rapidly recruit area injury inflammation participate bacterial phagocytosis kill . Disorders associate deficiency impairment PMN function ( neutropenia , chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , leukocyte adhesion deficiency ) predispose infection bacteria fungi . Regulation potent component acute inflammatory response imperative prevent overwhelming infection often associate morbidity mortality . Recently , neutrophil isolate healthy adult donor show undergo program cell death distinct apoptosis necrosis form neutrophil extracellular trap ( NETs ) . NETs extensive lattice extracellular DNA chromatin decorate anti-microbial protein degradative enzyme myeloperoxidase neutrophil elastase ( NE ) . NETs effect extracellular kill bacteria fungi . The laboratory Christian Yost , MD recently characterize impaired NET formation novel innate immune deficiency human newborn infant show PMNs isolate cord blood newborn infant , term preterm , demonstrate impaired NET formation extracellular bacterial killing compare PMNs isolate healthy adult . However , time developmental maturation newborn infant PMN NET formation remain unknown . Stem cell bone marrow transplant originate cord blood , peripheral stem cell , bone marrow stem cell . Regardless source stem cell , patient receive bone marrow transplant essentially build new immune system , newborn baby . Immune system reconstitution continuous process whose component take 1 2 year fully recover . Severe infection bone marrow transplant patient occur may associate deficient PMN NET formation way impair extracellular bacterial containment kill . We hypothesize increase risk infection attribute bone marrow transplant recipient result , part , deficient PMN NET formation nascent , post-engraftment immune system molecularly functionally similar newborn baby . We plan determine point transplant neutrophil derive transplanted stem cell competent form functional NETs . Furthermore , give importance platelet function NET formation , also plan examine platelet activation function well platelet transcriptome use clinical sample .</detailed_description>
