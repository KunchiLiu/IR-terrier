	<brief_title>Comparison Double Kissing Culotte Stenting With Double Kissing Crush Stenting True Bifurcation Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>How properly treat coronary bifurcation lesion ( BL ) still controversial field percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The current guideline recommend simpler strategy , single crossover stenting provisional stenting , preferred treatment . However , acute occlusion loss important branch , affect immediate well long-term outcome , may result simpler strategy treat severe true bifurcation lesion ( TBL ) . Therefore , procedural safety , double stenting clinically necessary particularly treatment major vessel bifurcation lesion . Up date , great number double-stenting technique introduce clinically : crush stenting ( classic crush , mini-crush , step-crush , DK-crush ) , culotte stenting ( classic modify culotte stenting ) , T-stenting ( classic modify T ) , V-stenting ( step V-stenting , simultaneous kiss stenting ) . Of , crush-based culotte-based stenting popular technique . The DK-crush demonstrate safe efficient procedure , effectively elevate success rate final kissing balloon inflation ( FKBI ) reduce long-term major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) . However , clinical real world , especially bifurcation angle relative small parallel , DK-crush still several limitation : ( 1 ) although initial kiss balloon inflation ( IKBI ) push away struts cover side-branch ostium remold geometric shape orifice , redundant strut crush aside onto parent-vessel wall side-branch ostium , thereby induce turbulent flow due local unsmooth vessel lumen ; ( 2 ) main-vessel stent release , side-branch orifice squeeze crush , thus result stent deformation , malapposition incomplete coverage near bifurcation arena carina ; ( 3 ) deformation crush side-branch stent ostium , rewire side-branch may extremely hard subsequent balloon pass difficulty , lead low quality failure FKBI , sometimes stent destruction wire run stent . Culotte-based stenting demonstrate superior crush-based stenting reduction side-branch restenosis though overall MACE similar Nordic study [ PMID : 20031690 ] . However , essential requirement similar size two branch use conventional culotte stenting . As firstly describe u , modify culotte stenting [ PMID : 22088451 ] , start stenting side-branch ( small branch ) pre-imbedding balloon main-branch prevention acute branch loss , strict requirement similar size two branch proven safe efficient procedure treatment TBL . However , diameter difference two branch much ( &gt; 0.75 mm ) , circular under-expansion band ( CUEB ) main-branch stent parent vessel near bifurcation arena frequently occur since side-branch stent implant earlier limit expansion main-branch stent implant subsequently side-hole portion protrude parent vessel , lead local stent malapposition risk in-stent thrombosis . For overcome CUEB , improve culotte-based stenting order develop novel culotte stenting , DK-mini-culotte stenting , follow modification : ( 1 ) pre-imbedding balloon main-branch prevention acute vessel loss , ( 2 ) firstly stenting small side-branch shorter protrusion ( mini-protrusion ) stent parent vessel , ( 3 ) performing IKBI prior main-branch stenting fully expand side-hole protruded portion side-branch stent , ( 4 ) finally stenting main-branch IKBI , follow FKBI . Our series study , include mimic stenting artificial vessel vitro , hemodynamics flow-field investigation vitro vivo , pilot clinical observation , demonstrate DK-mini-culotte stenting necessary achievement high-quality hemodynamic morphological result , superior crush-based technique treat TBL . Particularly , initial clinical experience show DK-mini-culotte stenting several advantage : ( 1 ) efficiently eliminate CUEB prevent stent malapposition IKBI ; ( 2 ) technically easy perform , particularly wiring/rewiring balloon pass IKBI FKBI ; ( 3 ) technically safer complete procedure , especially prevent acute vessel occlusion loss ; ( 4 ) effectively prevent deformation collapse occasionally happen use crush-based stenting ; ( 5 ) mostly close general technique treat BL regardless size difference branch bifurcation angle ; ( 6 ) potentially long-term benefit complete even stent coverage treat segment particularly bifurcation arena carina . However , remain strictly compare study validate whether above-mentioned technical superiority translate clinical benefit use DK-mini-culotte stenting treatment BL . So , hypothesize DK-mini-culotte stenting feasible technically also may superior least inferior DK-crush stenting term reduce in-stent restenosis MACE . Hereby , carry head-to-head , prospective , multicentre , non-inferior , randomize control study compare DK-culotte stenting versus DK-crush stenting treatment TBL .</detailed_description>
