	<detailed_description>In allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) recipient , early reduction absolute lung volume diffuse capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) frequently detect even absence overt idiopathic pneumonia syndrome ( IPS ) [ PMID : 22221781 ] . Two month allo-HSCT , recently show increase lung tissue density determine quantitative CT scan [ PMID : 22898044 ] . It hypothesize parenchymal change might due occult intersitial lung disease associate infection , acute Graft-versus-Host Disease ( aGvHD ) , myeloablative conditioning regimen combination [ PMID : 21531955 ] . To test hypothesis , simultaneously measure lung diffuse capacity nitric oxide ( DLNO ) DLCO . Assuming , clinical purpose , reaction rate NO blood hemoglobin infinite DLNO = DMNO = DMCO*alpha ( alpha = NO/CO diffusivity ratio ) , partition effect HSCT membrane diffuse capacity ( DM ) pulmonary capillary volume ( Vc ) use DLNO/DLCO ratio [ PMID:16478855 ] . As hypothesize GHVD intuitively absent amongst autologous HSCT ( auto-HSCT ) recipient , compare change DLNO/DLCO ratio show latter group subject undergoing allo-HSCT .</detailed_description>
