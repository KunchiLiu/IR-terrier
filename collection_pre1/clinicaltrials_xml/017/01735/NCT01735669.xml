	<brief_summary>Objectives : The objective demonstrate superiority remifentanil versus nitrous oxide adjuvant analgesic treatment increase chance success external cephalic version management non-cephalic presentation woman singleton pregnancy term . Another objective compare safety , tolerability acceptability . Methodology : single-center clinical trial , randomize , open , parallel-group sequential design , active comparator . Pragmatic approach . Sequential design O'Brien-Fleming two interim analysis . Analysis intention treat . Comparison rate successful version , refer analgesic effect , safety , caesarean rate acceptability rate procedure pregnant woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluate Efficacy Safety Remifentanil Versus Nitrous Oxide External Cephalic Version Term Singleton Pregnancy Breech Presentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>External cephalic version procedure clear benefit , realization painful patient . Studies show pain limit external cephalic version effort therefore negatively influence success rate . In addition , painful procedure bad acceptance patient implementation slow always universal . In context , measure reduce pain could improve success rate acceptance procedure . All study focus reduce pain external cephalic version make regional anaesthetic technique , epidural spinal analgesia . Given heterogeneity small number study still conclusive data make recommendation regional anaesthesia external cephalic version . The introduction regional anaesthesia bring benefit version without drawback . This invasive anaesthetic technique reduce security procedure lead longer hospital stay patient blockade produce low extremity . This turn associate increase discomfort cost procedure . Cruces University Hospital wide experience carry external cephalic version procedure , one Spanish lead hospital term number procedure success rate . Currently external cephalic version procedure include analgesic support use nitrous oxide due combination moderate analgesic activity substantial ease use . The investigator belief use opioid advantageous pharmacokinetic property powerful analgesic effect adjunctive therapy course external cephalic version procedure may become efficacious safe alternative , lead increase pain relief improve external cephalic version success rate . Its use require , however , specific personnel organizational facility access anesthetic support impede widespread use . Therefore , investigator commit explore feasibility practical implementation factor well comparative efficacy safety approach non-cephalic presentation . The investigator conduct study evaluate effect nitrous oxide adjunctive external cephalic version observe slight decrease patient report pain ( visual analogous scale ) , effect rate success . Currently , protocol Cruces University Hospital administration nitrous oxide manoeuvre external cephalic version routine practice . The investigator consider analgesic remifentanil well option external cephalic version nitrous oxide combination rapid onset effect , analgesic potency similar regional anaesthesia rapid metabolism prevents accumulation tissue . The lack exist evidence issue , hence , prompt investigator conduct pilot clinical trial aim assess scientific well logistical aspect involve performance external cephalic version non-cephalic presentation .</detailed_description>
