	<brief_title>PREPARE：Assessing Safety Efficacy Radial Versus Femoral Approach PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transradial intervention ( TRI ) widely practice China , account approximate 80 90 % procedure . A recent meta-analysis indicate TRI advantage reduce major bleed ischemic event compare transfemoral intervention ( TFI ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . However , clinical trial yet show statistical equivalence term long-term efficacy TRI compare TFI treatment complex coronary lesion , simply due limited number subject enrol . The purpose PREPARE trial evaluate long-term safety efficacy TRI versus TFI PCI patient leave main ( LM ) and/or three-vessel coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
