	<detailed_description>Based clinical experimental observation study focus define effect two different formula intestinal permeability , IL ( interleukin ) -17 immunity , serum metabolome , gut microflora . The study base randomize pilot intervention trial use intention treat statistical analysis compare e.g . gut permeability two treatment group . The investigator hypothesize extensively hydrolyze casein formula decrease intestinal permeability , down-regulates IL-17 immunity proinflammatory lysophosphatidylcholines , stabilize Lactobacilli level gut microflora compare conventional cow 's milk formula . The study population comprise 120 newborn infant HLA ( Human Leukocyte Antigen ) -conferred susceptibility T1D . The mother encourage exclusively breast-feed infant long possible . The timing wean introduction study formula leave mother . The infant randomize weaned one two study formula : ( ) standard cow 's milk formula ( ii ) extensively hydrolyze casein formula . The target infant expose his/her study formula least 90 day age 270 day . The diet infant study 3-day food record age 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month age . To estimate amount breast milk receive weight infant measure lactation . The HLA genotype analyze cord blood , result available within 10 day birth . The family visit Study Center infant 3 , 6 , 9 , 12-month-old . Blood sample obtain visit . In addition family ask collect stool sample home month study . Intestinal permeability assess lactulose/mannitol test age 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month . Gut microflora analyze high-throughput , culture-independent method serum metabolome establish metabolomics platform . Il-17 immunity study use peripheral blood mononuclear cell . This work generate novel knowledge disease process lead overt T1D study potential mechanism ( ) mediate protective effect confer extensively hydrolyze casein formula beta-cell autoimmunity . The identification mechanism ( ) likely facilitate refinement effective preventive measure base modification early infant nutrition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The infant 's parent give sign consent participate HLA genotype eligible . An old sibling newborn infant include study ; Multiple gestation ; The parent unwilling unable feed infant cow 's milk base product reason ( e.g. , religious , cultural ) ; The gestational age newborn infant le 35 week Inability family take part study ( e.g . family access Study Center telephone ) The newborn infant recognizable severe illness due chromosomal abnormality , congenital malformation , respiratory failure need assist ventilation , enzyme deficiency , etc . ; The infant receive infant formula study formula Nutramigen delivery hospital No HLA sample drawn age 8 day .</criteria>
