	<detailed_description>Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) common gastrointestinal emergency encounter newborn intensive care unit represent significant cause morbidity mortality infant bear prematurely . This disease complicate management approximately 6 - 10 % low birthweight ( VLBW ) infants result significant feeding intolerance , intestinal perforation and/or death despite aggressive treatment ( 1 ) . The sequence event lead NEC appear multifactorial complex ( 2,3 ) . While epidemiologic study identify multiple factor appear increase infant 's risk development NEC , prematurity , single predictive risk factor clearly delineate ( 4,5 ) . Among possible risk factor , strong association elective RBC transfusion premature infant anemia subsequent development NEC consistently observe ( 6-11 ) . Possible explanation transfusion-associated NEC propose : 1 ) physiological impact anemia initiate cascade event lead ischemic-hypoxemic mucosal gut injury predispose NEC ( 10 ) ; 2 ) increase splanchnic blood flow follow RBC transfusion lead reperfusion injury gut mucosa . A significant ( increase ) number VLBW infant anemia manage erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( Epo ) iron receive RBC transfusion hospital stay . The present study proposes study particular group VLBW infant remain low ( &lt; 28 % ) hematocrit receive full enteral feeding . Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasive , FDA approve , bedside technology allow determination regional oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) tissue gut mesentery . Using NIRS , oxygenation status hemoglobin tissue locate 2-4 cm skin determine record continuously ( 12 ) . For instance , Dave et al . use NIRS demonstrate splanchnic rSO2 , cerebral rSO2 , increase feed stable prematurely born infant tolerate full bolus orogastric feeding ( 13 ) . Of importance , average hematocrit study group 37 % ( ±7 ) therefore baby significant anemia . While normative value exist mesenteric rSO2 premature infant , recent study explore NIRS use determine gut hypoxia ischemia ( 14 ) . Abdominal NIRS use detect alteration intestinal rSO2 perfusion premature piglet develop NEC ( 15 ) . In prospective cohort study 40 neonate medical surgical acute intraabdominal pathology , cerebro-splanchnic oxygenation ratio ( CSOR ) less 0.75 predict gut ischemia 90 % sensitivity ( 16 ) . While study support role NIRS monitoring mesenteric rSO2 , clear whether 1 ) VLBW significant anemia perturbation intestinal oxygenation perfusion , 2 ) alteration mesenteric rSO2 predict development NEC VLBW infant . We hypothesize significant anemia VLBW infant associate baseline low CSOR ( &lt; 0.75 ) measure NIRS , nasogastric feeding ( NGF ) particular patient lead decrease splanchnic oxygenation . We postulate CSOR value significantly low among VLBW develop NEC compare infant .</detailed_description>
