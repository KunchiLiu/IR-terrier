	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common clinical event severe consequence . In pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) , AKI occur almost 10 % patient evidence suggest child die AKI , AKI . Unfortunately , treatment AKI limit great extent delay diagnosis . Reliance marker kidney injury change significant damage already occur rendered potential therapy ineffective . For reason , identification new marker AKI change early course injury paramount . While new AKI biomarkers identify , performance general PICU population variable . The investigator recently propose concept 'renal angina ' way risk stratify patient ICU AKI risk . In AKI-CHERUB study , investigator propose study renal angina PICU patient alone combination urinary biomarkers AKI prediction . The investigator hypothesize renal angina increase predictive precision urinary biomarkers AKI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Prediction Acute Kidney Injury Children Using Risk Stratification Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reliance serum creatinine urine output diagnosis acute kidney injury ( AKI ) limit ability potential therapeutic measure effective . The investigator ' recent proposition renal angina construct aim improve expedite AKI diagnosis use risk stratification . An apt parallel profound outcome change effect acute coronary syndrome target troponin measurement patient risk factor clinical symptom coronary ischemia . Novel AKI biomarkers struggle gain widespread use performance patient vary degree AKI risk balance cost availability . The investigator hypothesize risk stratification use renal angina ( ANG ) identify child at-risk vs. at-risk AKI , focus subsequent biomarker measurement `` rule '' AKI child ANG , increase biomarker predictive precision . This study significant represent next step vertical integration AKI biomarkers routine clinical practice guide use rationally . The identification at-risk patient guide appropriate biomarker use high-impact make implementation preventive supportive therapy AKI effective ; data study would serve provide indication Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) biomarker use critically ill child . The study innovative first prospective attempt study predictive performance biomarkers AKI PICU population use ANG stratification . The investigator observe child admit PICU expect length stay &gt; 48 hour . Urine collect child level neutrophil gelatinase associate lipocalin ( NGAL ) , interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) , liver-fatty acid bind protein ( l-FABP ) , kidney injury molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) measure . Renal angina assess time admission . Primary outcome presence AKI ( measure Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcome ( KDIGO ) Class 2 great ) hospital day 3 .</detailed_description>
