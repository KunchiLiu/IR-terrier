	<detailed_description>Nerve decompression ( ND ) treatment foot complication diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy ( DSPN ) controversial topic although many patient find provide gratifying relief pain numbness . Neural electrical monitoring use intra-operatively diagnosis nerve abnormality , monitor ongoing normal nerve function confirm nerve integrity spine surgery thyroid surgery success . Presently objective data indicate use neural electrical monitoring reliable effective . The goal study measure objectively quantifiable clinical surgical outcome nerve decompression surgery diabetic neuropathy patient . The study design measure change nerve function , gait , balance blood flow low limb .</detailed_description>
