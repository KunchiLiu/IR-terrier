	<brief_summary>This study look whether electrical treatment provide special type pacemaker call Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) pacemaker may keep patient 's heart failure get bad . When low heart chamber ( i.e . ventricle ) electrically pace beat together CRT pacemaker , blood may pump body efficiently . The CRT pacemaker study clinical trial approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) patient moderate severe heart failure , whose heart pump blood inefficiently . In MIRACLE EF study , patient heart failure slightly less inefficient heart observe see electrical pace treatment well get treatment . This study conduct support FDA approval type pacemaker people whose heart failure less inefficient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medtronic , Inc. sponsor MIRACLE EF study , prospective , randomize , control , double-blinded , global multi-center , Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) Heart Failure ( HF ) clinical study . The purpose study evaluate market release CRT pacemaker ( CRT-P ) device symptomatic HF patient less severe leave ventricular systolic dysfunction , specifically patient reduce left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) range 36 % 50 % . This study support expansion indication CRT worldwide . The outcome study expect support modification exist U.S. Japanese label Medtronic 's implantable CRT-P device provide evidence support change cardiology practice guideline ( ACC/AHA , ESC guideline ) regard use CRT patient mild moderate HF . Following enrollment baseline assessment , eligible subject implant CRT-P system randomize 2:1 fashion either treatment ( CRT-P ON ) control ( CRT-P OFF ) group . Study subject follow minimum 24 month study closure , remain randomized group 60 month visit study stop , whichever come first . The effectiveness CRT-P population assess use composite endpoint time first event , event define All-cause mortality HF Event . To assess safety CRT-P population , primary safety endpoint measure freedom system-related complication 6 month post-implant .</detailed_description>
