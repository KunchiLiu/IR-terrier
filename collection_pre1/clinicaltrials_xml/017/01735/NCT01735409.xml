	<brief_summary>This single center , non-randomized phase IIa study determine tolerance safety Abraxane ( ABX ) combination cisplatin ( DDP ) patient advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . Patients standard therapy fail infeasible eligible.The safety efficacy evaluate accord NCI-CTCAE V4.0 RECIST 1.1 respectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-finding Study Abraxane Combination With Cisplatin Treat Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) commonly see Southeast Asia , especially southern southeastern China , incidence rate document 10 150 case per 100,000 population per year . For advanced metastatic NPC , chemotherapy remain mainstay treatment . The 130-nm albumin-bound formulation paclitaxel ( [ Abraxane , ABX ] ; Celgene , Summit , NJ ) promise new agent efficient entry tumor microenvironment via caveolae-mediated transcytosis preferential uptake cancer cell . Superior activity ABX-based regimen without necessity antianaphylactic pretreatments show various solid tumor compare traditional solvent-based paclitaxel-based one . However , safety efficacy combination ABX cisplatin ( DDP ) determine patient advanced NPC . In single center , non-randomized phase IIa study , investigator seek determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) ABX-DDP , perform exploratory study efficacy measure tumor response .</detailed_description>
