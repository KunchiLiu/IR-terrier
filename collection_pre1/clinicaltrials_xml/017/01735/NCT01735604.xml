	<brief_title>Genetically Engineered Lymphocyte Therapy Treating Patients With Lymphoma That Resistant Refractory Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety feasibility chimeric antigen receptor T cell transduce anti-CD20 vector ( refer CART-20 cell ) . II . Determine duration vivo survival CART-20 cell . RT-PCR analysis whole blood use detect quantify survival CART-20 TCR zeta:4-1BB time . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . For patient detectable disease , measure anti-tumor response due CART-20 cell infusion . II . Estimate relative traffic CART-20 cell tumor bone marrow lymph node . III . For patient store accessible tumor cell ( patient active CLL , ALL , etc ) determine tumor cell kill CART-20 cell vitro . IV . Determine cellular humoral host immunity develop murine anti-CD20 , assess correlation loss detectable CART-20 ( loss engraftment ) . V. Determine relative subset CART-20 T cell ( Tcm , Tem , Treg ) . OUTLINE : Patients assign group accord order enrollment . Patients receive anti-CD20-CAR lentivirus vector-transduced autologous T cell 41BB-gamma vector 3-5 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow intensively 6 month , every 3 month 2 year , annually thereafter 13 year .</detailed_description>
