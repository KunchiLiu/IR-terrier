	<brief_title>Ultrasonography Guided Subacromial Sodium Hyaluronate Injection Rotator Cuff Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff disease particular common cause shoulder pain weakness comprise significant proportion musculoskeletal complaint present primary care doctor . Ultrasound readily available cheap modality look specifically rotator cuff surround structure . More recently , ultrasound guidance become commonly employed method perform diagnostic therapeutic intervention . Despite long history fact common diagnosis make clinical practice , exact cause best treatment condition still explore . Although high-quality study demonstrate efficacy sodium hyaluronate injection rotator cuff disease , study perform examine effect ultrasound-guided subacromial sodium hyaluronate injection patient impingement syndrome without rotator cuff complete tear .</detailed_description>
