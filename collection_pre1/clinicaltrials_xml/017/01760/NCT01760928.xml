	<brief_title>Guidance Patients With Asthma During Preparation During Expedition Aconcagua Mountain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preparation phase : Eighteen asthma patient select base physical medical characteristic . During year preparation , several time point evaluation plan : evaluation baseline , maximal exercise test hypoxia ( FiO2 : 11 % ) , 24hour stay cold air environment . At baseline , medical history evaluate clinical examination , ECG , lung function , Fraction exhale NO measurement histamine provocation perform . During second visit , patient stay approximately one hour chamber simulate high altitude ( FiO2:11 % ) perform maximal exercise test 30 minute rest . Oxygen saturation , ECG oxygen consumption continuously monitor . Lung function fraction exhale NO assessed test . Also , peripheral blood drawn test . This test allow u identify whether patient may develop acute mountain sickness later expedition . During third visit , patient stay 24 hour indoor ski centre practice climb technique , build tent work specialized material . Temperature ski piste varies -5°C -10°C . Lung function , fraction exhale NO induce sputum assess stay ski centre . During expedition , clinical status , heart rate oxygen saturation measure daily . Also , lung function fraction exhale NO regularly measure . A screen acute mountain sickness perform daily . Asthmatics patient support two pulmonologist . Before expedition , spirometry , histamine provocation induce sputum performed .</detailed_description>
