	<brief_summary>The combination capecitabine , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ( CAPOXIRI ) may better combination use treat earlier stage pancreatic cancer patient resectable ( able cut ) , borderline resectable , locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma . For subject obtain Capecitabine treat 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) along Oxaliplatin Irinotecan . Though drug study approve FDA , combination investigational .

	<detailed_description>Introduction : This phase II study evaluate treatment adherence rate , efficacy safety neoadjuvant chemotherapy capecitabine , oxaliplatin irinotecan ( CAPOXIRI ) patient resectable ( able cut ) , borderline resectable locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Neoadjuvant CAPOXIRI chemotherapy innovative strategy build advancement associate oxaliplatin , irinotecan , fluorouracil , folinate ( FOLFIRINOX regimen ) chemotherapy patient metastatic disease . Building FOLFIRINOX regimen use CAPOXIRI among clinically relevant project patient diagnose early stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma goal improve patient outcome advance knowledge understand devastate disease . The primary end point treatment adherence rate ( TAR ) percentage patient complete 75 % plan treatment ( dose ) diagnostic stratum ( resectable disease borderline resectable/locally advanced disease ) . Secondary end point : Overall survival ( OS ) , Disease-free survival ( DFS ; patient render disease-free surgical resection ) , Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) , Response Rate ( RR ) , toxicity , R0 resection rate ( patient stratify resectable disease borderline resectable disease ) . Background Study Rationale : It estimate 36,800 people die pancreatic cancer United States 2010 . Surgical resection offer chance cure , 15-20 % case potentially resectable present . Furthermore , prognosis poor , even undergo complete resection . Reported five-year survival rate follow pancreatic-duodenectomy ( surgery small intestine pancreas ) node-negative disease 25-30 % node-positive disease 10 % . The purpose study evaluate effect combination capecitabine , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ( CAPOXIRI ) disease . This research do think combination , CAPOXIRI , may better combination use treat stage pancreatic cancer . A research study like one do show similar combination drug include oxaliplatin , irinotecan 5-fluorouracil ( class capecitabine ) effective treat patient pancreatic cancer advance disease . All drug use study approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) .</detailed_description>
