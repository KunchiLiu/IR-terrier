	<detailed_description>The purpose research compare effect two commonly use , safe , thoracic spine grade 1-4 grade 5 mobilization thoracic spine cervical spine pain individual nontraumatic cervical pain . The immediate effect thoracic spine mobilization show facilitate great range motion increase cervical spine great pain decrease within treatment session follow-up visit . There research utilize pain threshold perception objective outcome treatment . Only one study compare two treatment technique conclude future research complete include manual therapy thoracic spine . ( Cleland 2007 ) The subject patient clinic own Physiotherapy Associates , Fit Physical Therapy , Allegheny Chesapeake PT seek physical therapy service nontraumatic neck pain . Participation entirely voluntary . Patients offer chance participate research project initial visit Physical Therapy . If PT identifies appropriate patient ask interested research subject . The Physical Therapist recruiting subject complete Doctor Physical Therapy Degree advance train manual Physical Therapy . The technique employ consider standard practice define entry level skill Commission Accredidation Physical Therapy Programs . These technique typically teach DPT degree program . If patient interested , description study provide . A consent form give participant . Research Procedures : 1 . Patients present one three Physical Therapy clinic , direction three advance clinician , assess potential participation research . The treat clinician recruit appropriate subject base includion exclusion criterion PT diagnosis . Those meet inclusion exclusion criterion give consent form determine wish participate . Each researcher formal training technique . Two clinician receive Orthopedic Clinical Specialists certification examination prcess outline American Physical Therapy association . A third researcher obtain fellowship designation American Academy Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy . This skill deem entry level Accredidation Board American Physical Therapy Educators . All Therapists undergo prestudy hand education program ensure use similar technique . 2 . If reading consent form agree participate , give one additional form , Pain Catastrophizing scale , ask complete . The scale , NDI , cervical ROM , age , birthdate record sheet contain patient 's clinical chart . 3 . The PT evaluation complete . 4 . They randomize one two group base roll die : Group One : Mobilization Group : group receive grade 1,2,3 , 4 mobilization prone base PT 's clinical judgement . The treatment parameter record . Group Two : Grade 5 mobilization group : group wil receive grade 5 mobilization . 5 . Additional treatment include patient eduation , modality , exercise complete PT deem appropriate , 6 . The second visit schedule within 24 48 hour . 7 . The patient complete form complete initial evaluation ( NDI , PCS ) return result may berecorded record sheet identify date birth . 8 . The treatment repeat include manual technique treatment deem appropriate PT . Additional treatment second last visit sole discretion treat PT . 9 . On discharge visit , patient receive form , ask much , term % , feel improve . This information record deidentified sheet . Home exercise program patient educaiton issue appropriate . A bubble goniometer use range motion assessment . This standard plastic device use PT practice . A Wagner FDX digital force gauge algometer measure pain pressure threshold . Where survey instrument involve , copy instrument , survey create project , assurance principal investigator proper approval use . The Neck Disability Index NDI use . It professional standard outcomes measure people neck pain . It show valid reliable . The Pain Castrophizing Scale use . It valid reliable measure patient 's perception pain commonly use . The data collect treat Physical Therapist access patient record treatment purpose . The data use purpose patient care research purpose . Patient 's data measure collect de-identified sheet mark patient birthday . The kept lock area clinic . The lead investigator access data study complete transfer lock file cabinet office data assessment . Following treatment patient may mild soreness area treat . This typically diminish 24 hour . patient inform potential soreness . The use heat /or ice , exercise , patient education provide Therapist concern activity posture also lessen soreness .</detailed_description>
