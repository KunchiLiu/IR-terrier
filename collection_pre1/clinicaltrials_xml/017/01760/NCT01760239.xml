	<brief_title>EHR-Based Clinical Decision Support Improve BP Management Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension ( HT ) adolescence track adulthood , contribute adult cardiovascular morbidity mortality . National guideline diagnosis treatment hypertension child adolescent develop National High Blood Pressure Education Program ( NHBPEP ) ; Fourth Report publish 2004 . Despite heightened awareness hypertension pediatric population , adolescent elevate blood pressure remain clinically unrecognized . Factors contribute gap care include : need translate adolescent blood pressure ( BP ) measure BP percentile basis age , gender , height , lack familiarity NHBPEP clinical guideline , compete demand clinical encounter . Electronic health record ( EHR ) -based clinical decision support ( CDS ) use address barrier support good care elevate BP HT adolescent . In project , investigator integrate EHR-extracted data sophisticate Web-based CDS algorithm provide patient-specific point-of-care clinical recommendation , accordance NHBPEP guideline . To evaluate impact innovation quality cost care , investigator randomize 18 clinic 130 pediatric care provider ( PCP ) estimate 17,000 adolescent patient receive receive EHR-based CDS intervention . The investigator hypothesize intervention improve recognition early management elevate BP short-term increase outpatient care cost offset longer-term clinical benefit , estimate use establish econometric model . This innovative project ( ) address under-recognized high-risk patient population adolescent , ( b ) integrate EHR Web-based CDS technology provide sophisticate patient-specific point-of-care CDS , ( c ) develop implement novel intuitive visual interface communicate CDS recommendation PCPs , ( ) provide clinical cost outcome data useful clinician policymakers . If EHR-based CDS intervention improve adherence NHBPEP recommendation , provide much-needed tool combat burgeon problem rise cardiovascular risk factor child adolescent . Further , regardless outcome , technology develop test provide many useful insight advance science EHR-based CDS . This , turn , help translate massive public private investment EHR technology improve adolescent health outcome .</detailed_description>
