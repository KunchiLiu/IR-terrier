	<brief_summary>To search suitable pharmacodynamic biomarkers , i.e. , high specificity calcineurin inhibition affect inter-individual variability , work aim explore pharmacodynamics CNI , strength variability signal translation along calcineurin pathway , well step source internal ( genetic ) external variability influential . In order achieve , assess simultaneously NFAT1 translocation nucleus peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) ( NFTA1 main NAFT isoform rest activate lymphocyte ) , intracellular expression IL-2 CD3+ , CD4+ CD8+ T cell subset membrane expression CD25 ( IL-2Rα ) , surface marker T cell activation , T cell large . A non-interventional clinical trial set healthy volunteer , patient register liver transplantation wait list ( WLP ) liver transplant recipient ( LTR ) . A different question address group : The healthy volunteer study ( n=35 ) : explore TAC PD along calcineurin pathway expose PBMC ex-vivo ; model signal translation along cascade ; examine interindividual variability TAC PD parameter ; investigate source variability observe contribution step calcineurin pathway . Furthermore , allow u evaluate analytical variability technique well intra-individual variability TAC PD parameter . WLP ( n=19 ) enrol confirm patient liver disease result obtain healthy volunteer , well test potential influence initial disease ex-vivo pharmacodynamics TAC . The aim transversal study LTR CNI ( n=80 ) explore interindividual variability PD CNI realistic clinical condition , i.e . situation residual PD activity tacrolimus cyclosporine exposure , potential pharmacogenetic ( PG ) source variability . The ( still small ) group liver transplant patient ( n=9 ) enrol immediately transplantation followed-up serial monitoring along first year post-transplantation intend explore relationship CNI PD clinical response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research conduct rule Good Clinical Practice , Good Laboratory Practice International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) Principles Declaration Helsinki . Groups study include inclusion/exclusion criterion verify write informed consent give : healthy volunteer , patient wait list liver transplantation , liver transplant recipient tacrolimus cyclosporine longitudinal cohort patient enrol since wait list transplantation . From instance proceed sample plan . Considering potential dropout withdrawal study , intention recruit additional 10 % compensate cohort , allow . The study design suppose apply mask method , since open study . All data require registration form record , however case persistent failure , properly document reason absence . Each instance merit particular analysis , date sign . Models could use estimate impact bias due potential miss data , applicable complement sensibility analysis . Loading data conduct electronically . Data validate accord data management plan , jointly define principal investigator biostatistician , include freeze thawing process . Pharmacokinetic , pharmacogenetic pharmacodynamic model do use R software . Data back ups run everyday , archive tape USB storage drive . Besides self monitoring procedure , study may audit health authority ( course study even complete ) , assess compliance standard Good Clinical Practice . Atypical result , handle accord criterion result outside specification . If re-analysis sample occur , properly document . Sample size calculation include percentage occurrence acute cellular rejection adverse event , report National Liver Transplant Program possible rate abandonment premature retirement study subject . Under national rate , study least 30 healthy volunteer , 50 patient 12 patient end stage liver disease enlist liver transplantation , serial follow-up first year . Statistical analysis perform accord principle `` intention treat '' , responsible least one specialist biostatistics . It develop descriptive analysis variable collect . Categorical variable express percentage number observation . Continuous variable express mean coefficient variation median 25th 75th percentile , minimum maximum . Lof transformation hold whenever need . The variable compare group accord patient 's original listing ( intention treat ) . They calculate present estimated relative risk effect 95 % confidence interval . For comparison categorical variable , use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate . For comparison continuous variable , use test `` '' Student . For variable develop time , represent Kaplan-Meier curve compare use `` log-rank '' test . Their relative risk 95 % confidence interval calculate . To identify variable associate different response multivariate linear analysis , logistic Cox proportional use . All analyze perform hypothesis test 2-tailed significance level 5 % . The program use R. Multivariate analysis hold correct accord Bonferroni 's criterion . We establish standard operating procedure describe blood collection instance , biological fluid sample circuit , evaluation candidate include study , verification inclusion criterion , monitor patient study , record undesirable event report adverse drug reaction , terminate tracking .</detailed_description>
