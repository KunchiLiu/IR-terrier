	<detailed_description>Intra-coronary stenting currently standard care post-balloon angioplasty ischemic heart disease . Traditionally , bare metal stent ( BMS ) use recent year largely replace drug-eluting stent ( DES ) reduce rate restenosis . ( 1 ) However , long term safety DES still remain controversial due report late stent thrombosis presumably occur secondary delay arterial heal local hypersensitivity reaction may relate drug , polymer , . ( 2 ) . Virmani et al ( 3 ) report patient die late stent thrombosis 18 month sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) implantation show severe localize hypersensitivity reaction involve whole vessel wall reaction may cause polymer drug-release kinetics SES . It known preclinical clinical study , nonabsorbable polymer induce persistent inflammation may lead delay cellular proliferation 'late catch-up ' restenosis ( 4 ) . Early ( ie first ) generation DES consist metal stent vessel scaffolding , cytotoxic drug neointimal growth inhibition polymer coat improve biocompatibility stent vehicle load drug onto stent . Since polymer identify possible cause late complication DES , new stent design improve polymer ' biocompatibility bond drug stent without polymer . Biodegradable polymer likely safer nonabsorbable polymer inflammation eliminate polymer degrades . The BioFreedom drug coat stent ( DCS ) Coronary Stent Delivery System comprise three key component include 1 ) 316 L stainless steel bare metal stent platform modify proprietary surface treatment result selectively micro-structured , abluminal surface . The selectively micro-structured surface allow 2 ) Biolimus A9TM ( drug ) adhesion abluminal surface stent without use polymer binder . The drug-coated stent crimp onto 3 ) delivery system include high pressure , semi-compliant balloon incorporate onto distal tip rapid exchange delivery catheter system . The delivery system two radiopaque marker inside balloon , fluoroscopically mark end stent facilitate proper stent placement . Biolimus A9 therapeutic agent use BioFreedom DCS . Biolimus A9 proprietary semi-synthetic sirolimus derivative . It highly lipophilic , rapidly absorb tissue , able reversibly inhibit growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation . Current data suggest Biolimus A9 , molecular level , form complex cytoplasmic protein inhibit cell cycle G0 G1 phase . The result interruption cascade govern cell reproduction , growth , proliferation . Related pharmaceutical , sirolimus everolimus , well tolerate cytostatic immunosuppressive agent predictable similar adverse event profile . Biolimus A9 closely related chemically sirolimus everolimus . Based administration healthy volunteer , Biolimus A9 show similar adverse event profile two drug use equivalent dose levels. , Biolimus A9 easily cross cell membrane achieve therapeutic effect target smooth muscle cell , compare sirolimus-eluting Cypher stent ( SES ) , high lipophilicity BA9 lead relatively low systemic exposure . ( 5 ) Furthermore , drug coating apply abluminal surface stent , allow drug release direct almost entirely vessel wall target smooth muscle cell injure angioplasty procedure . On hand , little drug release luminal surface stent , thus less inhibition endothelial cell need grow inside stent order heal occur . Animal study show Biofreedom stent demonstrate equivalent less early late reduction intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation compare Cypher Sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) porcine model . After implantation BioFreedom stent , delay arterial heal show minimal , increased inflammation 180 day compare SES implantation ( 6 ) . Pharmacokinetic tissue concentration analyse show high early peaking Biolimus A9 level blood ( 6 ) . On-going study Biofreedom human show non-inferiority in-stent late lumen loss 12 month versus paclitaxel elute stent ( PES ) ( 7 ) . This current EGO BIOFREEDOM study protocol design base approve protocol EGO Study EGO-COMBO Study , successfully complete . We aim focus mainly time frame , degree endothelialization , subsequent neointimal proliferation BioFreedom stent implantation , assess state-of-the-art intracoronary image - optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , use extensively complete EGO EGO-COMBO study . Indeed , intracoronary optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) simple catheter-based imaging technique use optic fibre achieve detail assessment ( resolution 100 micron ) intra-coronary stent apposition , early stent coverage ( endothelialization ) late stent neoinitmal growth ( restenosis ) . It perform part routine cardiac catheterization procedure provide high-resolution cross sectional image coronary artery . OCT show safe clinical practice ( 8 ) . The LightLab C7XR OCT system ( Frequency Domain OCT ) commercial available product CE Mark FDA approval , use EGO Studies . The OCT catheter non-occlusive optic fibre extremely small flexible . It pose additional risk patient inherent risk standard angioplasty procedure .</detailed_description>
