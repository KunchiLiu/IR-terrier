	<brief_title>Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trial : An Opportunity Prevent Dementia . A Study Potential Disease Modifying Treatments Individuals Risk With Type Early Onset Alzheimer 's Disease Caused Genetic Mutation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mutation presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ) , presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ) amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) associate autosomal dominant Alzheimer 's disease high penetrance ( near 100 % ) . This study target individual either know disease-causing mutation risk mutation ( child sibling proband know mutation ) unaware genetic status . Because age onset cognitive change relatively consistent within family mutation ( Ryman et al. , 2014 ) , age onset determine affected parent mutation . This study enroll subject either asymptomatic within specific window time expect age onset family and/or mutation symptom mild Alzheimer 's disease . The ability identify individual destine develop Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) within next 10-15 year high degree confidence provide unique opportunity ass efficacy therapy asymptomatic early stage dementia . Although difference dominantly inherit AD common age-associated sporadic disease , result early intervention study implication future study treatment sporadic AD . Families know disease-causing mutation extremely rare geographically disperse throughout world . These constraint necessitate specialize study design . Many subject study yet cognitive symptom AD ; `` asymptomatic '' carrier mutation cause Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer 's disease would expect perform normally standard cognitive functional testing . Imaging fluid biomarkers use demonstrate treatment compound engage therapeutic target . A set cognitive measure design assess early subtle cognitive change collect . Additionally , many at-risk individual decide know whether disease-associated mutation , at-risk individual enrol study disease cause mutation ; `` mutation negative '' . It important enroll non-carrier subject avoid coercion ( e.g. , potential subject may pressure genetic testing learn genetic status order eligible trial ) . These mutation negative individual assign placebo group ; subject site study staff remain blinded individual ' active placebo group assignment mutation status . Thus , study double blind placebo mutation status , except mutation positive subject aware genetic status . Two different therapy test order increase likelihood effective treatment discover . They select trial base mechanism action available data efficacy safety profile . The study design include pooled placebo arm share treatment group . Mutation positive subject randomize one four study arm ( gantenerumab : gantenerumab placebo : solanezumab : solanezumab placebo ) overall 3:1:3:1 ratio active drug : placebo . Mutation negative subject receive placebo . Importantly , subject study staff blind treatment group subject assign ; blind whether subject randomize active drug placebo arm . Biomarker data analyze prespecified endpoint consistent drug 's mechanism action know effect test biomarkers . The primary cognitive endpoint treatment arm . Interim analysis image fluid biomarker endpoint ass safety whether study drug engage biological target . This biomarker approach particularly important study study subject cognitively normal time enrollment remain cognitively normal first 2 year study . The cognitive composite design assess subtle cognitive change may detectable onset dementia . The four year cognitive endpoint allow analysis subtle cognitive change .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Between 1880 year age Individuals know Alzheimer 's diseasecausing mutation unaware genetic status 50 % chance autosomal dominant Alzheimer 's disease ( ADAD ) mutation ( e.g . parent sibling know ADcausing mutation ) Are within 15 + 10 year predict actual age cognitive symptom onset Cognitively normal mild cognitive impairment mild dementia , Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) 01 ( inclusive ) Able undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Lumbar Puncture ( LP ) , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) , complete study relate test evaluation . For woman childbearing potential , partner sterilize , subject must agree use effective contraceptive measure ( hormonal contraception , intrauterine device , sexual abstinence , barrier method spermicide ) . Adequate visual auditory ability perform aspect cognitive functional assessment . Has Study Partner investigator 's judgment able provide accurate information subject 's cognitive functional ability , agree provide information study visit require informant input scale completion . History presence brain MRI scan indicative significant abnormality Presence pacemaker , aneurysm clip , artificial heart valve , ear implant , foreign metal object eye , skin body would preclude MRI scan . History presence clinically significant cardiovascular disease , hepatic/renal disorder , infectious disease immune disorder , metabolic/endocrine disorder Anticoagulants except low dose ( â‰¤ 325 mg ) aspirin . Have expose monoclonal antibody target beta amyloid peptide within past six month . History cancer within last 5 year , except basal cell carcinoma , nonsquamous skin carcinoma , prostate cancer carcinoma situ significant progression past 2 year . Positive urine serum pregnancy test plan desire become pregnant course trial . Subjects unable complete study relate test , include implant metal remove MRI scan , require anticoagulation pregnancy .</criteria>
