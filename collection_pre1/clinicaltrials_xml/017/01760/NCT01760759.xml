	<brief_summary>In study , investigator propose randomize 165 human immunodeficiency virus positive patient one three 16-week treatment condition : ( 1 ) standard care ; ( 2 ) standard care + cell phone-based adherence reminder ; ( 3 ) standard care + cell phone-based adherence reminder contingency management . In latter condition , patient earn reinforcement send time- date-stamped self videos antiretroviral therapy medication ingestion . Primary outcome include viral load self-report measure adherence , effect evaluate treatment period throughout one-year follow-up . Investigators hypothesize cell phone reminder condition improve adherence relative standard care , cell phone reminder plus contingency management condition best outcome . Results study may widespread implication use cell phone novel technology improve initial adherence antiretroviral therapy , thereby reduce spread drug resistant human immunodeficiency virus strain community .</brief_summary>
