	<detailed_description>Drug elute balloon ( DEB ) develop overcome limitation drug elute stent ( DES ) , clinical result different study DEB consistent . Thus , perform meta-analysis compare outcomes DEB DES coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The meta-analysis perform accord recommend method [ 14-15 ] . A systematic search eligible study involve MEDLINE , CENTRAL , Embase , Highwire Press , Scopus Google Scholar database conduct without language restriction two independent investigator ( A.L . A.R . ) , use follow keywords : `` drug '' , `` eluting '' `` balloon ( ) '' , `` DEB '' , `` coronary '' , `` angioplasty '' . Divergences resolve consensus . Endnote software v. 10 use build library result combine erase duplicate . The reference retrieve study search manually additional trial , effort contact author perform obtain study detail additional reference . The search update December 2012 . Selection criterion : citation screen title abstract level retrieve full report . - Inclusion criterion : 1 ) randomize study cohort study report comparison DEB treat group DES treat group ; 2 ) availability report late lumen loss ( LLL ) and/or overall death and/or myocardial infarction ( MI ) and/or stent thrombosis ( ST ) and/or target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) . - Exclusion criterion : 1 ) duplicate reporting ( case manuscript report large sample long follow-up select ) , 2 ) follow least 6 month ; 3 ) study present composite major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) without mention individual end point . Data abstract pre-specified form 2 unblinded reviewer ; divergence resolve consensus . Internal validity : present meta-analysis perform accord Guidelines randomize controlled trial Cochrane Collaboration non randomize study compliance Guidelines MOOSE group . Quality include study appraise 2 unblinded investigator . The risk selection , performance , detection , attrition bias ( express low risk bias [ A ] , moderate risk bias [ B ] , high risk bias [ C ] , incomplete report leading inability ensure underlie risk bias [ D ] ) evaluate separately , recommend . Non-randomized study evaluate use Newcastle-Ottawa Scale validate technique assess quality non-randomized study . Data analysis synthesis : Odds ratio ( ORs ) compute individual study pool accord fix effect ( e.g . inverse variance weight ) random effect model case statistical heterogeneity . Two separate subgroup analysis pre-specified : 1 ) exclusion study small vessel bifurcation PCI ; 2 ) exclusion non-randomized study 3 ) exclusion study DEBs use together BMS deployment . Results present overall meta-analysis subgroup meta-analyses DEB v DES comparison . Outcomes appraise in-stent LLL , overall death , MI , ST TLR . We use Mantel-Haenszel method combine ORs , validate method pool data meta-analysis binary outcome . For in-stent LLL outcome , mean difference 6-month LLL compare baseline use overall weighted mean difference ( WMD ) build inverse variance method . Heterogeneity assess Cochran 's Q test , 2-tailed p=0.1 . Statistical inconsistency test ( I2 ) also employ overcome low statistical power Cochran 's Q test . The potential publication bias examine construct `` funnel plot '' , sample size plot odds ratio . In addition , mathematical estimate asymmetry plot provide linear regression approach . Asymmetry consider present intercept regression line deviate significantly zero . To explore mitigate heterogeneity , pre-specified covariates ( prevalence diabetes study population reference coronary vessel diameter ) potential confounders consider meta-regression analysis . Pooling data , subgroup analysis publication bias test perform Review Manager 5.1 ( The Nordic Cochrane Center , KÃ¸behvn , Denmark ) StatsDirect v 2.7.8 ( StatsDirect Ltd , Cheshire WA , UK ) . Meta-regression analysis build Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 2 ( Biostat , Englewood , New Jersey , United States ) .</detailed_description>
