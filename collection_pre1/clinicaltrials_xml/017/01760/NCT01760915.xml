	<brief_summary>The overall goal proposal well understand basis structural airway change severe asthma asthma exacerbation may contribute progression time . The investigator propose study well-characterized cohort adult pediatric subject asthma use multidisciplinary state-of-the-art approach . We hypothesize severe asthma exacerbation , patient , associate incomplete recovery activation airway inflammatory cell regional distribution . The end result permanent less reversible airway obstruction prominent feature severe asthma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We show patient severe asthma heterogeneous regional ventilation defect air trap . Some defect persistent , others provoke virus-induced exacerbation bronchial challenge recur general area repeat challenge , suggest localize airway dysfunction . In preliminary study , inflammatory parameter tend prominent segment show ventilation defect image . Therefore , hypothesize asthma exacerbation , patient , associate incomplete recovery activation airway inflammatory cell regional distribution . This lead enhance airway injury airway dysfunction reflect ventilation defect air trap , generalized increase disease severity . To evaluate hypothesis propose follow specific aim : 1 . To refine phenotyping severe asthma use new variable multiple domain large longitudinal patient cohort ; determine contribution asthma exacerbation disease progression . 2 . To characterize regional obstructive pattern baseline relationship change pulmonary function ; determine incremental change regional airway dysfunction asthma exacerbation may contribute severe asthma . 3 . To determine contribution establish novel biomarkers ( YKL-40 , vWF , &amp; P-selectin ) , refine severe asthma phenotype role inflammatory cell cause airway injury follow virus-induced asthma exacerbation subsequent development ventilation defect .</detailed_description>
