	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation show provide improve survival even patient older 70 year age . The purpose study determine whether kidney transplantation provide improvement health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) patient age 65 year . HRQOL wil monitor use Kidney Disease Quality Life ( KDQOL-SF ) form . Patients recruit time acceptance Norwegian transplant wait list follow every 6 month transplantation . Thereafter new form complete 10 week postv transplant , 6 month , 1 year , 3 year 5 year . In addition study explore transplant candidate expectation qualitative study design explore relationship pre-transplant comorbidity , HRQOL survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Evaluate HRQoL longitudinally time wait list 1 year kidney transplantation among kidney transplant candidate older 65 year age . Data collection The HRQoL monitor prospective , longitudinal study ( QUESTION65 ) . A minimum 200 patient included inclusion period estimate 2-3 year . All patient give informed consent enter study . In addition , patient sign informed consent include Norwegian Renal Registry allow use unidentified data registry research protocol . HRQoL assess use KDQOL-SF-36 health Survey . This survey consist two part , generic disease specific part . The questionnaire use transplantation . For improved evaluation HRQoL data response shift capture question related personal preference , value internal standard . The result gather also compare data age match Norwegian cohort . All patient age 65 accept kidney transplantation wait list live donor transplantation receive invitation include study . A new form distribute include patient interval six month transplant , permanently remove transplant wait list death . Patients transplant receive form discharge Rikshospitalet ( 10 week transplantation ) , six month one year . Aim 2 : Explore expectation old kidney transplant candidate prior transplantation one year transplantation . Data Collection : For qualitative evaluation , 15-20 patient dialysis include qualitative individual in-depth interview perform approximately one month baseline HRQoL repeat one year transplantation . Selection make accord age gender . Inclusion continue saturation reach . Convenient variation broadness information secure sample . To secure share decision making , patient invite discuss interview guide design qualitative evaluation . Furthermore , interview guide test pilot study . An interview-manual used PhD Andersen considerable clinical experience within field . We believe result qualitative interview also use gain improved understanding answer survey . Aim 3 : Investigate relationship pre-transplant comorbidity , describe Liu comorbidity index post-operative complication , post-transplant 1 year survival HRQoL . Data collection From 2012 include pre-transplant data accord Liu comorbidity index part routine work candidate kidney transplantation . Complete data describe patient transplant characteristic , include Liu comorbidity index extract Norwegian Renal Registry . In addition post-transplant morbidity mortality extract Norwegian Renal Registry . The data export registry without identification except patient number . In case miss data registry , data retrieve patient record Oslo University Hospital HF , Rikshospitalet . The key necessary identification store registry .</detailed_description>
