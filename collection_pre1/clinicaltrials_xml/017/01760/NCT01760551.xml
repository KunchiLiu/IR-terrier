	<brief_summary>The American Medical Association 's ( AMA ) Guides Evaluation Permanent Impairment use rate loss function determine compensation ability work injury illness . The AMA Guides use many different system determine compensable level impairment . However , study evaluate reliability construct validity . ( 1 ) In professional community exist considerable controversy regard accuracy usefulness AMA Guides . ( 2,3 ) Commentaries note AMA Guides provide valid , reliable , evidence-based system rating impairment . ( 4 ) Some argue impairment rating reflect individual 's actual loss function quality life ( QOL ) . The AMA guide 5th edition base loss range motion ( ROM ) . The new 6th edition AMA guide base diagnosis inclusion functional outcome assessment determination impairment rating . ( 5 ) In orthopaedic literature use patient-derived , objective outcome measure substantially expand QOL instrument categorize general health condition-specific questionnaire . The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form ( SF-36 ) general health-based survey quality life . It validate use widely across medical discipline . ( 6 ) The SF-36 construct survey health status Medical Outcomes Study . It design use clinical practice research , health policy evaluation , general population survey . The SF-36 constructed self-administration person 14 year age old , administration train interviewer person telephone . ( 7 ) The SF-36 perhaps widely use health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) survey instrument world today . It comprise 36 item assess eight health concept : physical functioning , role limitation cause physical health problem , role limitation cause emotional problem , social functioning , emotional well-being , energy/fatigue , pain , general health perception . Physical mental health summary score also derive eight RAND-36 scale . ( 8 ) The aim study determine amount correlation orthopaedic surgeon objectively calculated percentage impairment score American Medical Association guide evaluation permanent impairment patient subjectively indicate health-related quality life score SF-36 . Hypotheses : Because inclusion functional outcome assessment determination impairment rating AMA guide 6th edition good correlation SF-36 . The 6th edition AMA guide base diagnosis en yield lower impairment percentage AMA guide 5th edition base loss ROM . The SF-36 good correlation impairment rating low extremity injury upper extremity less valid upper extremity .</brief_summary>
