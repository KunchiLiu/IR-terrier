	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore efficacy safety H-Coil rTMS comparison sham H-Coil rTMS old patient treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.Subjects randomize receive H1-Coil rTMS sham H1-Coil rTMS . The acute treatment phase last four week . Treatment administer daily , 5 day per week ( i.e. , 20 treatment ) . Depressive symptom assess use HDRS-24 . If subject achieve pre-defined primary outcome criterion remission ( HDRS-24 score &lt; 10 60 % reduction symptom ) continue twice weekly treatment two week ensure durability remission . Subjects achieve remission exit study acute treatment phase four week . The blind broken subject completion study</brief_summary>
