	<brief_summary>The study design compare abuse liability intranasal buprenorphine buprenorphine/naloxone individual physically dependent sublingual buprenorphine . The investigator hypothesize abuse liability buprenorphine/naloxone low buprenorphine alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reinforcing Effects Intranasal ( IN ) Buprenorphine Versus Buprenorphine/Naloxone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although sublingual buprenorphine effective treatment opioid addiction , medication abuse liability , country , largely replace heroin opioid drug choice . In response report diversion abuse sublingual ( SL ) buprenorphine , potentially less abusable formulation buprenorphine contain naloxone market several country . However , relative abuse liability buprenorphine alone buprenorphine/naloxone combination buprenorphine-dependent individual unclear . Preliminary data study fund Schering-Plough Corporation suggest buprenorphine/naloxone combination , give intravenously ( IV ) , indeed less abuse liability IV buprenorphine buprenorphine-dependent individual . In addition IV abuse buprenorphine , epidemiological data suggest buprenorphine widely abuse intranasal ( IN ) route . However , data exist abuse liability either IN buprenorphine alone buprenorphine/naloxone combination . Several study show naloxone effective antagonist opioid agonist effect give intravenously , clear whether naloxone give intranasally effective give route administration . Some study suggest equally effective ( Loimer et al. , 1994 ) , others show naloxone give intranasally less effective ( i.e. , slow onset effect ) give route administration ( Kelly et al. , 2005 ) . How may impact ability naloxone reduce reinforce effect IN buprenorphine unclear . The primary aim current study proposal compare reinforce effect IN buprenorphine buprenorphine/naloxone IN opioid abuser maintain SL buprenorphine use study design parallel use recent study abuse liability IV buprenorphine buprenorphine/naloxone . Placebo , heroin , naloxone use neutral , positive , negative control , respectively . Secondary aim compare subjective , performance , physiological effect IN buprenorphine buprenorphine/naloxone . Overall , study complement investigation IV buprenorphine product allow complete overview within laboratory self-administration model intravenous intranasal abuse liability buprenorphine versus buprenorphine/naloxone individual maintain buprenorphine . The primary aim study compare reinforce effect IN buprenorphine IN buprenorphine/naloxone opioid abuser maintain different dos sublingual buprenorphine . Secondary aim study compare subjective , performance physiological effect IN buprenorphine IN buprenorphine/naloxone . IN-administered placebo ( lactose powder ) , naloxone alone , heroin alone tested neutral , negative , positive control condition , respectively . Participants ( N=12 completers ) reside inpatient unit ( 5-South ) 7 8-week study . This research provide useful information clinician treat opioid dependent individual buprenorphine , importantly , provide information abuse potential effect buprenorphine multiple measure human functioning .</detailed_description>
