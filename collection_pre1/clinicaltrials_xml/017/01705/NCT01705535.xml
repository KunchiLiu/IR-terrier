	<brief_summary>Fecal incontinence complaint involuntary loss feces . Fecal incontinence affect 2-12 % adult population . It hide problem - le one third affect person discus problem doctor . The condition negative effect quality life . It associate shame limitation social life , leisure , occupational sexual activity . Pelvic floor muscle exercise without use biofeedback recommend use treatment fecal incontinence last decade . Several uncontrolled trial control trial show positive effect training , trial small and/or methodological problem . Therefore day still lack sufficient evidence effect pelvic floor muscle exercise treatment fecal incontinence . The aim study compare effect individual physiotherapeutic supervise pelvic floor muscle train program control physiotherapeutic treatment ( massage neck back ) . Both treatment give parallel standard information guidance give nurse specialized anal incontinence issue . Study hypothesis : Pelvic floor muscle exercise give parallel standard advice guidance specialize nurse , provide well effect reduce fecal incontinence control treatment standard advice alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Physiotherapy Treatment Fecal Incontinence .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , investigator blind , randomize control trial two parallel arm . 100 participant randomize one two group . Ratio 1:1 . Baseline data consist physical examination , anal ultrasound thorough medical history include age , duration complaint , fecal incontinence specific symptom know risk factor fecal incontinence . Group 1 receive standard information guidance care specialized nurse . The treatment consist advice diet fiber supplement information optimize bowel empty use antidiarrheal medication appropriate . In addition participant receive six individual treatment 30 minute physiotherapist . This treatment consist massage back neck . The participant get instruction pelvic floor muscle exercise . Group 2 receive information guidance specialist nurse group 1 . In addition receive six individual treatment 45 minute physiotherapist specialized incontinence problem pelvic floor disorder . The participant get instruction anatomy function pelvic floor muscle instruction correct pelvic floor muscle contraction . The pelvic floor muscle exercise teach verbal instruction vaginal anal palpation . For session physiotherapist , participant get physiotherapeutic examination pelvic floor muscle vaginal rectal examination . The pelvic floor muscle external anal sphincter strength measure accord Modified Oxford Score ( range 0-5 ) . Endurance sub-maximal contraction determine . The function pelvic floor muscle also measure intra-anal EMG biofeedback . Biofeedback use give participant visual auditory feedback correct pelvic floor muscle contraction enhance participant awareness , strength endurance correct pelvic floor muscle contraction . Biofeedback also use sit stand position ass pelvic floor muscle function position . According finding physiotherapeutic examination prepare individual adapt pelvic floor muscle train program . The program consist 3 set 10 contraction sustain till 10 second 2 set 3 contraction sustain till 30 second . 1 minute rest set . The participant also instruct contract pelvic floor response anal urgency situation increase intra abdominal pressure . The participant encourage perform training program daily basis instruct fill training dairy . The diary use motivational tool quantify amount training . The individual training program adjust , base finding examination , participant instruct perform exercise different position movement e.g . transfer , lift , walk , cough . The treatment group distribute 16 week , treatment week 0,2,5,8,12 16 . Note 15. februar 2016 : Due logistical reason , fail perform 12 month follow-up first 15 patient , decide change follow-up 12 month 36 month . This enable u perform long-term outcome assessment include patient . This change affect pre-specified primary endpoint . In order achieve high respond rate possible decide restrict follow-up measurement questionnaire : Patient Global Impression Improvement Scale ( PGI-I scale ) , Fecal Incontinence Severity Index ( FISI ) , St. Marks Incontinence Score ( Vaizey ) Fecal Incontinence Quality Life Scale ( FIQL ) . Questions treatment fecal incontinence since completion study amount current pelvic floor muscle exercise add . We thus decide omit anal manometry , rectal capacity measurement diaries 36 month follow-up measurement .</detailed_description>
