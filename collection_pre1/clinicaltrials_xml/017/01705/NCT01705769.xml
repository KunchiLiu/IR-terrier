	<brief_title>Effects Three Feeding Regimens Recovery Uncomplicated Severely Acute Malnourished Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>India account half global burden severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) world . While important accelerate effort prevent SAM , effective management child suffer critical reduce child mortality achieve MDG1 MDG4 . Available evidence mostly study Africa suggest home base management uncomplicated SAM Ready Use Therapeutic Foods ( RUTF ) least efficacious facility-based management locally produce RUTF efficacious centrally produce RUTF . More evidence efficacy effectiveness home base management use RUTF need decide intervention offer substantial advantage home-prepared food Indian setting . Additionally , demand generate evidence efficacy locally produce RUTF compare centrally produce RUTF . These issue resolve well design randomize control trial . This project therefore aim ass efficacy three option consideration India home management SAM . The investigator propose conduct multi-center randomize control trial determine efficacy two community-supported home-based regime use centrally locally produce Ready Use Therapeutic Foods ( RUTF ) recovery uncomplicated SAM 16 week management , compare augment home-prepared food regimen . The trial enroll 911 child uncomplicated SAM enough statistical power detect 15 % great difference recovery rate either one intervention group compare comparison group . Participants : The study conduct three site - urban slum resettlement colony national capital region , rural ( predominantly tribal ) Rajasthan , rural urban Tamil Nadu . Field worker survey study area measure mid-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) child 6 59 month age refer child MUAC le 13 cm study clinic . At study clinic , anthropometric measurement take child weight height less -3 SD WHO standard oedema foot offer participation study . Intervention Comparison Regimes Home Management SAM - Children randomize first intervention arm ( Arm 1 ) receive centrally produce RUTF . - Children randomize second intervention arm ( Arm 2 ) receive locally produce RUTF . - Children randomize comparison group ( Arm 3 ) receive augment Home-Prepared Foods . The amount food advise child 3 study arm calculate provide 175cal/kg body weight per day . These food give child time enrollment recovery ( beyond 16 week ) . Caregivers enrol child receive counsel frequency feeding , amount feed , encourage child continue breastfeed good hygiene practice . Additional support volunteer community provide mother give consent , assist feed child . Management Phases : The management two phase : Treatment Phase : From enrolment recovery 16 week ( whichever early ) , enrol child provide food accord study group randomize , counsel use . Sustenance Phase : After completion treatment phase , child arm refer close Anganwadi centre he/she access supplementary food give child part ICDS strategy . The sustenance phase last 16 week end treatment phase . Outcomes : A trained standardized team field worker conduct weekly anthropometric measurement also record morbidity , hospitalization deaths enrolment , weekly till recovery 16 week whichever earlier . In addition , mortality hospitalization data collect 16 week post treatment phase . The primary outcome recovery 16 week enrollment ( define achieve weight height great equal -2 SD absence oedema ) . Secondary outcome include : - To compare weight gain ( grams/kg body weight/day ) enrolment till recovery , till 16 week attain recovery , 16 week recovery . - To compare time require reach recovery ( week ) . - To determine incidence prevalence diarrhea , ARI fever treatment phase - To compare mortality hospitalization treatment phase , 16 week recovery - To compare perception family , health care provider ICDS functionary regard feasibility use feed regimen sub sample enrolment tom completion treatment phase - To ascertain factor affect recovery , 16 week post enrolment recover . - To compare perception family regard Anganwadi centre experience end sustenance phase . - To compare proportion child weight height great equal -2 SD absence oedema foot 16 week recovery ( 32 week enrolment recover ) - To document cost implement feed regimen till end treatment phase . This include : 1 . Estimation cost human resource input 2 . Estimation household cost 3 . Costs per week per child estimate base total cost cover population The project approve National Research Alliance SAM constitute Department Health Family Welfare , Department Health Research Department Biotechnology . It coordinate Centre Health Research Development-Society Applied Studies . WHO provide technical support monitoring study implementation response request Alliance . Oversight study provide Technical Advisory group constitute Alliance Data Safety Monitoring Board . Clearances seek state government Delhi , Rajasthan Tamil Nadu .</detailed_description>
