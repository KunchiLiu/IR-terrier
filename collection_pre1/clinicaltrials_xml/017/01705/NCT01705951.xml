	<brief_summary>This project prompt urgent public health need identify novel strategy prevent treat tobacco-related cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) compelling pilot data suggest cessation smoking result rapid amelioration endothelial function . The high prevalence CVD metabolic syndrome smoker become major health care concern . Therefore , find optimal intervention strategy combat grow epidemic imperative . We investigate efficacy resistance training ameliorate endothelial dysfunction , oxidative stress , inflammation , insulin resistance four group : presence absence resistance training without cessation treatment + nicotine replacement . The investigator hypothesize resistance training improve cardiovascular function smoker ; however , response well also stop smoking . In addition , resistance training decrease smoking , however , effect counsel nicotine replacement alone counsel nicotine replacement conjunction resistance training well resistance train alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct 12-week randomized-controlled trial 100 young adult smoker . At week 0 , participant attend three outpatient visit baseline . Each participant randomize one four group : Resistance Training ( RT ) /Nicotine Replacement Therapy ( NRT ) , RT/No NRT , No RT/NRT , No RT/No NRT . Those receive RT work certify personal trainer 3 time per week 12 week 60 minute session . Those receive NRT use nicotine patch daily 12 week call California Smoker 's Helpline smoking cessation counseling . Those control group receive intervention maintain current lifestyle habit . At week 13 , participant return three post-intervention assessment . At week 26 , survey data collect assess change lifestyle habit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Young Adults ( 1835 yr . ) Male female smoker Smokers ( smoke least one cigarette day 15 day last month smoke 100 cigarette life ) 13 year experience consistently exercising/training ≤2 days/wk RT ≤1 day/wk aerobic exercise Capable providing inform consent UCLA students/staff Non UCLA student/staff Participant good health determine baseline visit Documented CAD Has cardiac surgery Currently weight loss exercise program 6 month prior participation . Use medication influence CV function preclude ability train Syndromes prescribe medication may influence CVD , body composition , insulin action ( e.g . prednisone , Ritalin , Adderall , GH ) Unable exercise Diagnosed syndrome disease may influence body composition CV risk ( e.g . Cushing syndrome ) . Known heart arrhythmia and/or abnormality find electrocardiogram ( ECG ) reading would prevent someone perform exercise intervention . If subject demonstrate abnormal ECG preintervention visit ( followup visit ) subject 's ECG review ( approval ) cardiologist continue study . Pregnant Use hormonal contraceptive Currently smoke cessation program include use NRT within month participation</criteria>
