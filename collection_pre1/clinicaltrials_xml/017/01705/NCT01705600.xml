	<brief_summary>The primary goal study examine effect limit complaint pain pain catastrophizing ( PC ) individual low back pain ( LBP ) state central sensitization ( CS ) . The study perform individual LBP state CS . CS classify type pain follow dominant feature : pain disproportionate nature extent injury/pathology ; disproportionate , non-mechanical , unpredictable pattern pain provocation response aggravating/easing factor ; strong association maladaptive psychological factor ; diffuse/non-anatomic area pain/tenderness palpation . These criterion demonstrate discriminative validity diagnose CS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Verbalization Patients With Non-specific Low Back Pain Central Sensitization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize ( 1:1 ) control trial experimental control group . The control group treat clinician wish give bracelet wear treatment . The experimental group treat clinician wish well give bracelet journal follow instruction : The goal bracelet help recognize verbal complaint , believe may relate pain . We ask wear follow rule : 1 . Place bracelet either wrist . Please identify journal wrist place date . 2 . If verbally complain Anything , include pain , switch wrist , identify date , wrist switch , complaint . Internal complaint thought allow . 3 . Indicate complaint make feel well , bad . We want attempt limit complaint alter word express way could make situation well . For example , instead say `` way cold outside '' say , `` I could wear clothes today I would less cold '' . Participating clinician complete power-point educational session train randomization process , rule bracelet goal study . A short education piece central sensitization also provide . Each clinician consent successfully complete understand aspect participation . We also require clinician complete short questionnaire ask follow question : 1 . What high degree education ? 2 . Do board certification specialization ? 3 . What type set treat ? 4 . How many year treat clinician ? The clinician also complete Pain Attitudes Beliefs Scale Physiotherapists ( PABS-PT ) self-reported measure discriminate biomedical biopsychosocial orientation therapist regard low back pain management . The PABS-PT available several language ( e.g . English , German , Dutch , Brazilian-Portuguese ) appear generate reliable valid data ( Ostelo et al. , 2003 ; Laekeman et al. , 2008 ; Magalh√£es et al. , 2011 ; Mutsaers et al. , 2012 ) . The treat clinician take pain measurement visual analogue scale pain catastrophizing pain catastrophizing scale week 1 , week 4 , week 12 6-months . The subject may discharge clinician feel successfully achieve goal reach plateau . We anticipate discharge average 4-6 week begin treatment . We ask continue track progress 6 month post-enrollment . The clinician also ask patient rate global rating change use GROC scale discharge . A detailed registration type intervention clinician apply submit researcher ( include number treatment session ) restriction clinician treat patient . In addition , ask participant list drug take ( include change participant ) non-PT intervention undergo ( ie . surgery , injection , etc ) . This crucial estimate 'real ' treatment effect experimental intervention . Concealed allocation perform use computer-generated randomize table number create prior study . Individual , sequentially numbered index card random assign number would prepare . These would fold place sealed opaque envelope participant would choose . A researcher provide bracelet without instruction , depend group allocation . The subject compensate way monetarily . The patient benefit study satisfaction provide pool physical therapy research . Each subject verbally explain study well provide consent form agreement participation . The consent form highlight potential risk benefit participation . The subject sign consent form file within physical therapy facility study complete . In addition ask patient demographic questionnaire fill baseline include question : 1 . When current episode back pain begin ? 2 . How many episode back pain experienced lifetime ? 3 . What age ? 4 . What nationality ? 5 . What gender ? 6 . What education level ? 7 . Do expect back pain ever resolve ? There inherent risk participation study . The subject convenience sample volunteer participate screen Physical Therapist . The Physical Therapist would verbally explain study well obtain consent attach informed consent form .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Individuals age 18 present physical therapy clinical diagnosis nonspecific low back pain . Their pain must also one follow characteristic : 2a.the pain disproportionate nature extent injury/pathology AND/OR 2b.the pain disproportionate , nonmechanical , unpredictable response aggravating/easing factor AND/OR 2c.the pain strong association maladaptive psychological factor AND/OR 2d . pain diffuse/nonanatomic area pain/tenderness palpation . 1 . Any redflags indicating low back pain cause nonmusculoskeletal pathology 2 . Pain whose origin could better define noceptive ( intermittent sharp movement mechanical provocation ; pain localized area injury dysfunction ; clear , proportionate mechanical/anatomical nature aggravate ease factor ; pain described shooting , burning , sharp , electriclike ; pain association dysesthesias ; night pain/disturbed sleep ; antalgic postures/movement ) 3 . Pain whose origin could better define peripheral neuropathic ( history nerve injury , pathology mechanical compromise ; pain dermatomal cutaneous distribution ; pain/symptoms provocation movement test move compress neural tissue ( ex . SLR )</criteria>
