	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study capecitabine celecoxib treat patient solid malignancy metastatic remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving capecitabine celecoxib together may effective treatment solid malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Celecoxib Patients With Solid Cancers That Have Been Previously Treated With Standard Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare steady state pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( primarily minimum concentration [ Cmin ] , maximum concentration [ Cmax ] , area curve [ AUC ] ) celecoxib day 7 monotherapy versus day 14 concomitant administration capecitabine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop celecoxib PK drug interaction model use longitudinal data determine whether result concordant result primary objective . II . To assess impact know cytochrome P450 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ) pharmacogenetic variant reduce enzyme activity ( CYP2C9*2 *3 ) subject variability celecoxib PK . III . To assess tumor response Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST , version 1.1 ) explore whether correlation celecoxib PK response . IV . To assess toxicity Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE , version 4.0 ) explore whether correlation celecoxib PK toxicity relate either celecoxib capecitabine . OUTLINE : Patients receive celecoxib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 7 day ( course 0 ) day 1-21 course 1 subsequent course . Patients also receive capecitabine PO BID day 1-14 begin course 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
