	<brief_summary>The aim 3-year randomized , single-blinded clinical trial compare effect high low feedback performance bedside exercise device heart liver transplantation recipient hospitalization immediately transplantation . The hypothesis study heart/liver transplantation recipient high feedback performance bedside exercise device progressively increase level exercise course hospitalization , independent ambulation level , good walk speed 6-minute walk test discharge , good cardiorespiratory fitness 4-8 week transplantation receive low feedback . The adult patient newly receive heart liver transplantation National Taiwan University Hospital evaluate eligibility study acute postoperative period . The study conduct intensive care unit ward environment . The study subject randomize either high low feedback performance bedside exercise device use hand/foot pedal record exert force adjustable resistance , measure repetition upper low extremity cycling movement , give feedback performance via wireless internet connection . The study also monitor amount daily movement activity subject trial use triaxial accelerometer , activity recognition algorithm develop engineer computer scientist University California Los Angeles . The outcome measure include level independence walking , walk speed , 6-minute walk test , cardiopulmonary exercise test blind observer . The study expect enroll least 50 heart transplantation recipient 60 liver transplantation recipient 3 year . The result study offer much insight activity level heart liver transplantation recipient early postoperative period . Besides , heart transplantation recipient receive routine phase I cardiac rehabilitation program physical therapist study liver transplantation recipient . We might able evaluate interaction effect routine physical therapy UCFit exercise among study subject . Our data also provide insight active inactive transplantation recipient may help generate idea organ transplantation rehabilitation program increase fitness-related activity prior discharge .</brief_summary>
