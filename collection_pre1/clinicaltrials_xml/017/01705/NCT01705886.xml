	<brief_summary>The purpose study document compare surgical surgery cost , recovery time , outcomes two procedure type : - Robotic assist surgery replace one compartment knee - Manual ( robot use ) surgery replace three compartment knee ( total knee replacement ) The hypothesis robot assist partial knee replacement cost effective provide clinical outcome equivalent manual total knee replacement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance : The primary indication joint replacement surgery include severe low extremity pain prevents individual perform normal daily activity . The level pain experience patient manage successfully oral medication , physical therapy , joint injection steroid hyaluronic acid . The source pain commonly result arthritic change joint ; arthritis may due osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , traumatic arthritis . Patients appropriate candidate partial joint replacement surgery also may experience joint stiffness interferes normal daily activity . In addition , usually radiographic evidence change joint cause arthritic process . Joint damage evaluate radiographically order classify severity joint disease . Partial joint replacement surgery perform replace diseased part joint prosthesis . There variety option surgeon patient choose joint replacement surgery . There many different joint replacement component system manufacture several different company ; system recommend particular type patient others use great number patient . Recently , new technique introduce classify minimally invasive require small surgical incision implant standard joint prosthesis . Patients young , thinner , good overall health usually best surgical candidate minimally invasive procedure . Osteoarthritis affect 40 million Americans 15 million people United States suffer degenerative arthritis knee . Unicondylar knee arthroplasty ( UKA ) introduce treatment option degenerative arthritis knee early 1970 's [ 1 ] . The procedure initially yield variable result unpredictability result broadly low level usage [ 1 ] . Recent improvement surgical technique technology use UKA increase effectiveness surgery . As average age United States population increase , surgical procedure become even common . It estimate Millennium Research Group 55,100 unicondylar knee procedure 2010 compound annual growth rate 2009 2014 8.3 % . UKA knee arthroplasty view attractive alternative total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) assume patient 's osteoarthritis remain isolated single compartment two compartment . UKA knee arthroplasty generally less invasive procedure TKA . Since procedure less invasive usually less blood loss ; cartilage , tissue , bone spar , result shorter recovery time TKA . This procedure attractive adult interested remain active pain-free lifestyle age . The cost-effectiveness healthcare intervention , especially new technology , become essential . Comparing procedural cost robotic-assisted surgery outcome patient versus TKA , gold standard , help substantiate whether robotic-assisted surgery economic viewpoint cost-effective treatment . In addition rehabilitation knee replacement surgery critical achieve proper functional outcome . Information pertain knee replacement post discharge cost limit . Due lack study continue growth number knee arthroplasty surgery imperative track post discharge cost variable . We document compare procedural postoperative cost , recovery time , outcomes three procedure type robotic assist unicompartmental knee arthroplasty , robotic assist bicompartmental knee arthroplasty manual total knee arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
