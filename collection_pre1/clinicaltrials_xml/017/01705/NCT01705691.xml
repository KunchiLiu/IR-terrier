	<brief_summary>NSABP FB-9 Phase II , multi-center , randomize study eribulin weekly paclitaxel follow doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) neoadjuvant therapy woman HER2-negative , operable locally advanced breast cancer ( stage IIb III ) . Patients control arm receive neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel ( WP ) follow AC . The primary aim study determine pathologic complete response ( ypCR ) breast axillary lymph node follow completion neoadjuvant therapy . The secondary aim include determination ypCR axillary node , clinical complete response ( ycCR ) rate eribulin paclitaxel completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy , two-year recurrence-free interval , two-year overall survival , toxicity neoadjuvant regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Weekly Paclitaxel Eribulin Followed A/C Women With Locally Advanced HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize one two neoadjuvant therapy regimen . Patients Arm 1 receive WP 80 mg/m2 12 dos follow standard AC every 21 day 4 cycle . Patients Arm 2 receive 4 cycle eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 day 1 8 21-day cycle follow standard AC every 21 day 4 cycle . As soon possible follow recovery chemotherapy , patient either lumpectomy mastectomy axillary staging . In arm , clinical response assess physical exam day 1 study therapy cycle . MRI breast require within 4 week prior randomization follow completion eribulin WP ( start AC ) . Following recovery surgery , patient receive radiation therapy hormonal therapy clinically indicate . Other postoperative therapy prohibit . Patients randomize control arm ( Arm 1 ) investigational arm ( Arm 2 ) 1:2 ratio . The sample size 50 patient 30 patient Arm 2 half number Arm 1 . Accrual expect occur 15 month .</detailed_description>
