	<brief_summary>The first objective measure QALYs ( Quality Adjusted Life Years ) Brazilian child adolescent , submit methylphenidate immediate-release treatment Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . For , Health Utility Index scale ( HUI ) complete patient and/or family , two moment observation study immediate-release methylphenidate : baseline 6th month treatment follow-up . The result provide information calculate utility measure determine QALYs ( Quality Adjusted Life Years ) . After , cost-effectiveness treatment , use Markov model decision analysis , Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 random trial . Subjects submit immediate-release methylphenidate treatment maximum dose 0.5mg/kg/day . The total treatment monitoring 06 ( six ) month , patient evaluate baseline , first , third sixth month . The HUI rating scale fulfil parent patient ( &gt; 12 year old ) baseline 6th month . The period inclusion new patient comprise 01/01/2011 31/12/2013 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cost-effectiveness Treatment Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder With Methylphenidate Immediate-release Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , Brazil estimate quality life , and/or utility ADHD economy analysis . Such data necessary calculate QALYs ( Quality Adjusted Life Years ) . Thus , investigator implement Health Utility Index tool ( HUI ) complete patient and/or family , two moment observational study immediate-release methylphenidate : baseline 6th month treatment . The determination QALY outcome decision analysis justify HUI incorporate single measure morbidity mortality . The result cost-effectiveness study assist government agency process decision making . To determine cost-effectiveness methylphenidate immediate release available Brazilian market , investigator use Markov model decision analysis . The development model analysis result adopt standard establish Methodological Guidelines Brazilian Ministry Health , perspective Brazilian National Health System . Medications price obtain Board Market Regulation Medicines ( CMED ) site ANVISA ( National Health Surveillance Agency ) . For treatment strategy provide great cost ratio calculate incremental cost-effectiveness , compare low cost . To estimate accurately impact life , Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 random trial conduct . This one treatment group observational study , 140 patient , control . Where indicated , suggest use 10 mg methylphenidate maximum dose 0.5 mg / kg / day . The total treatment monitoring 06 ( six ) month , patient evaluate baseline , first , third sixth month . The HUI rating scale fulfil parent patient ( &gt; 12 year old ) baseline 6th month . The period inclusion new patient comprise 01/01/2011 31/12/2013 .</detailed_description>
