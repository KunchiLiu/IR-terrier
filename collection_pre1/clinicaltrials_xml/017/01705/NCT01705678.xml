	<brief_summary>There evidence dietary supplementation fish oil health benefit , especially respect know risk factor cardiovascular ( heart ) disease cardiac arrhythmia . However , supply fish oil limit , desirable validate alternative sustainable source important omega−3 fatty acid component . It suggest oil krill , small marine crustacean , may effective possibly beneficial fish oil , may provide effective beneficial supplement . Dietary management cardiovascular health parameter ( blood lipid ) become important rise trend obesity nationally worldwide lead escalate incidence diabetes heart disease . The investigator propose use specific novel lipid measurement cardiovascular risk test possibility group men , although generally healthy , show risk factor term weight metabolic profile.This pilot study provide preliminary data show whether krill oil similar different effect fish oil cardiovascular health overweight otherwise healthy men , particular provide detail information alteration novel lipid marker cardiovascular disease , may well diagnostic tool classical lipid measurement ( e.g . serum cholesterol ) . The investigator develop validate new technique measure emerge lipid marker cardiovascular risk accurately continue develop investigate technique course project . The investigator hypothesise krill oil efficacious reduce marker risk relate cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
