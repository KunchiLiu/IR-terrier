	<detailed_description>At time life , 1 5 people pituitary tumor , 1 600 tumor grow large enough ( &gt; 1 cm diameter ) surgical resection require . Traditionally , surgery remove pituitary tumor tumor skull base require transcranial transfacial access . In approach , large traumatic , often disfigure , opening must create patient 's forehead cheek . Endonasal skull base surgery reduce invasiveness result less trauma , few complication , short surgical time . However , despite compelling advantage patient , small percentage skull base surgery do endonasally . While exact statistic available , current best estimate literature le 50 % likely le 20 % tumor address endonasal surgery . The endonasal approach underemployed despite demonstrated benefit patient exist surgical instrument limited dexterity approach angle , simultaneously manipulate several nostril perform complex surgical procedure technically challenge small number expert surgeon accomplish . Even expert , mortality rate non-negligible ( 0.9 % ) , remain contraindication endonasal approach , include occlusion surgical site delicate critical neurovascular structure ( e.g . carotid artery , optic nerve ) , inability fully reconstruct dura due lack surgical tool dexterity , long surgical duration . All contraindication directly relate limitation instrument dexterity visualization , motivate development robotic system endonasal skull base surgery . Such robot potentially increase surgical dexterity reduce technical complexity procedure surgeon , thereby increase percentage patient benefit endonasal technique . While many robotic system develop intravascular intervention well natural orifice surgery though orifice , comparatively system target endonasal surgery . This likely due small size nasal cavity nostril compare natural orifice . For endonasal robot , limited space available nostril opening , combine need work dexterously within cavity head , implies instrument shaft must small diameter enable dexterous motion instrument tip . A recently invent robot design match characteristic concentric tube robot concept , also know name active cannula . A robot suitable endonasal surgery develop ( see reference # 3 ) , however order optimize robotic system , intraoperative data must obtain determine robot interacts patient 's tissue . The aim study modify traditional tool use operating room allow determination force skull base hard soft tissue . This surgical curette use standard fashion endonasal skull base surgery , however provide valuable information . The modified curette consist two segment join Nano17 6-axis force sensor . ( Image 1 ) The force sensor integrate shaft instrument ( standard neurosurgical ring curette ) insulate shaft two polyetherimide ( also know ULTEM ) disk current transmit force sensor curette . The sensor hold shaft medical grade adhesive set screw . The patient recruit PIs clinical practice . Informed consent obtain . At appropriate time surgery curette use collect force date . This force transducer operate 5V ( 4.8-9V range ) . These transducer commonly use medical dental research ( see reference # 5 ) . No additional operating room anesthesia time require .</detailed_description>
