	<brief_summary>This study initiate preliminary premise thrombus whose formation trigger thrombogenic substrate , within atherosclerotic plaque ( Tissue factor initiate thrombus ) , may evolve differently one evolve site recently implant stent ( foreign body trigger ) . Consequently , thrombus composition de novo clot could differ one , extract occurrence subacute thrombosis , regard number various cell , amount fibrin platelet aggregate relationship among component . In addition , seem relevant evaluate number distribution local monocyte , cell may interact platelet ( via cell -adhesion mechanism e.g. , CD31 [ PECAM-1 ] ) extrinsic coagulation pathway ( via TF/FVII elaborate plaque-resident macrophage ) . Such distinction , eventually find , may reveal mechanism thrombosis within coronary artery , may clinical implication .</brief_summary>
