	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy bevacizumab monotherapy standard chemotherapy ( DTIC ) patient metastatic malignant melanoma . In addition , want evaluate predictive value set biomarkers associate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) dependent angiogenesis . Also , aim identify mechanism cause acquire resistance treatment bevacizumab escape mechanism cause angiogenic growth factor VEGF . Finally , want analyze safety influence outcome variable primary prevention bevacizumab induce hypertension low dose beta blocker comparison ACE inhibitor .</brief_summary>
