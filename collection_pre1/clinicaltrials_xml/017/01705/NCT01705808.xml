	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis septic shock life threaten medical emergency among significant challenge critical care . Case report case series suggest plasma-derived protein C concentrate may improve outcome patient acquire protein C deficiency . Evidence accumulate clinical relevance PC pathway modulate overwhelming inflammation prevent coagulation derangement , two key mediator organ damage , thus mortality morbidity , sepsis . The experience collect study show PC safe , associated bleeding severe allergic complication , possibly useful , least improve coagulation abnormality bring sepsis . Unfortunately , however , know come case series case report underpowered randomize control study . A randomized clinical trial , adequately powered mortality clinically relevant outcome , necessary confirm PC efficacy.The aim study demonstrate Protein C zymogen clinically relevant implication term reduction thromboembolic event , 30 day mortality , length intensive care hospital stay , time mechanical ventilation , length ICU hospital stay . The study also confirm bleed concern use Protein C concentrates.The study drug administer Intensive Care Unit 72 hour patient observe till ICU discharge . Telephone followup perform 30 day one year .</brief_summary>
