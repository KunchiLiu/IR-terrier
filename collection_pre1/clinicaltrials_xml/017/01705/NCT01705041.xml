	<brief_title>Preliminary Evaluation Point-Of-Care Liver Function Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DFA transaminase test provide rapid categorical measurement ALT whole blood specimen take via finger-stick . The test base platform technology `` paper microfluidics '' ( also know `` patterned paper '' ) , hydrophobic barrier pattern sheet paper order create microfluidic , hydrophilic path within paper , flow direct towards specific detection zone . The test design visual color-coded readout three ALT range ( `` bin '' ) correspond range AST ALT ( &lt; 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , 3-5x ULN , &gt; 5x ULN ) currently use clinical management decision per US TB HIV treatment guideline . The bin cutoff common treatment guideline use around globe , include use Vietnam Ministry Health . The colorimetric readout design read eye use visual `` read guide '' allow reader make semi-quantitative estimate assign categorical value one three bin . Alternatively , device scan ( e.g . desk-top scanner ) photograph ( e.g . cell phone standard digital camera , see ( 9 ) ) read image-analysis software , possible generate quantitative result . Additionally , multiple control zone notify user insufficient sample volume , hemolysis , damage reagent . The overall goal study conduct preliminary field evaluation investigational transaminase test population risk DILI . The primary objective : 1 . Determine device accuracy measure percent agreement categorical visual readout DFA transaminase test standard care test use HTD HIV clinic . 2 . Determine inter-operator variability . 3 . Determine device failure rate define invalid test result .</detailed_description>
