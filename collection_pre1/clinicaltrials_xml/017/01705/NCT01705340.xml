	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose Akt inhibitor MK2206 lapatinib ditosylate give together trastuzumab treat patient locally advance metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER2 ) -positive breast , gastric , gastroesophageal cancer remove surgery . Akt inhibitor MK2206 lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need tumor growth . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving Akt inhibitor MK2206 lapatinib ditosylate together trastuzumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) combination trastuzumab lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) adult patient locally advanced metastatic HER2-positive breast gastric cancer ; two schedule lapatinib administration examined-continuous daily dose pulsatile dose . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To provide preliminary assessment safety tolerability MK-2206 administer combination epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) /HER2 blockade via trastuzumab lapatinib adult patient locally advanced metastatic HER2-positive breast gastric tumor . II . To explore anti-tumor activity MK-2206 combination trastuzumab lapatinib patient advance HER2-positive solid tumor . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate anti-tumor activity MK-2206 combination trastuzumab lapatinib HER2-positive solid tumor patient phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway activation event , e.g. , phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) relate gene mutation expression ; compare HER2 PI3K-PTEN mutation status primary tumor metastatic tumor biopsy available . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Akt inhibitor MK2206 lapatinib ditosylate . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 ; lapatinib ditosylate PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 ; trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
