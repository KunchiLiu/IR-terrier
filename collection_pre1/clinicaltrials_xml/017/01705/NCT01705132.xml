	<brief_title>Urinary Biomarkers Progression Alport Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cross-sectional , observational , single-center study affect Alport patient progress advanced chronic renal insufficiency ( CKD Stages 4 5 ) , nephrotic range proteinuria ( urine protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt; 3 ) . There require study site visit . Instead , encounter occur via telephone subject home . This study consist single , first morning void urine collection subject meet eligibility criterion . Eligibility criterion inform consent obtain via telephone order non-intrusive subject possible . Alport subject recruit via Alport Syndrome Treatments Outcome Registry ( ASTOR , University Minnesota ) . ASTOR large Alport Syndrome registry USA , comprise approximately 500 people affected Alport Syndrome . Subjects meet eligibility criterion ask provide clinical demographic information single urine sample . A portion de-identified sample send Covance Laboratories process Novartis remainder process , store analyzed University Minnesota . Subjects provide consent give kit instruction collect urine sample . Kits return via overnight courier study site . ASTOR study personnel communicate subject via telephone confirm proper first-morning void collection technique , obtain clinical historical information . Approximately 80 Alport subject enrol study via ASTOR . Of 80 Alport subject , approximately 25 % ( N = 20 ) significant proteinuria ( spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≤ 0.2 ) , approximately 75 % ( N = 60 ) non-postural , non-nephrotic proteinuria ( define spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt; 0.2 &lt; 3 least 2 last 3 clinical assessment ) . Approximately 40 healthy volunteer provide urine sample elsewhere , outside scope protocol . Healthy volunteer urine sample need first-morning voided specimen , however specimen screen via dipstick semi-quantitative protein analysis . Only sample negative trace protein dipstick include study . Informed consent form include kit send eligible Alport subject . Informed consent take place via telephone , preferably via video chat/Skype whenever possible .</detailed_description>
