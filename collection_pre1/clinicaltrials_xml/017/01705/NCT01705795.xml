	<brief_title>Anti-IL-5 Therapy Bullous Pemphigoid ( BP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Bullous pemphigoid ( BP ) common autoimmune blister skin disease . It characteristically affect elderly ( &gt; 70 year ) annual incidence 5 35 per million . This comparable incidence eosinophilic esophagitis determine approximately 14 per million . Eosinophilic esophagitis recognize emerge medical problem , consequently , several study anti-IL-5-antibodies perform still ongoing . It note , however , , contrast eosinophilic esophagitis , incidence BP dramatically increase average 17 % per year . Moreover , increase proportion elderly industrialized world , medical problem associate BP even visible near future . For instance , patient BP increase mortality risk 2.3 . In US , increase mortality BP patient notice 1979 2002 . Taken together , BP frequent disease affect mostly elderly . BP often start extremely pruritic skin lesion resemble eczema urticaria vesicle blister arise . In 10-30 % patient , BP also involve oral mucosa . Disease severity determine mean autoimmune bullous skin disorder intensity score ( ABSIS ) evaluate involved area well disease activity . The disease due autoimmune response structural component junctional adhesion complex lead damage dermal-epidermal junction subepidermal blister formation . Specifically , autoreactive B T cell response hemidesmosomal antigen BP180 BP230 identify . Serum level autoantibody BP180 reflect disease severity activity . The T cell memory CD4+ cell produce Th1 Th2 cytokine , mostly IL-4 , IL-5 IL-13 . IL-5 well eotaxin abundantly find blister fluid . The production IL-5 indeed associate blood eosinophilia significant eosinophil infiltration skin BP patient . Eosinophils think critically implicate blister formation release toxic granule protein ( ESP , MBP ) proteolytic enzyme . Systemic corticosteroid widely use treatment BP . Nevertheless , use steroid limit side effect . therapy-resistant case , immunosuppressive drug azathioprine , chlorambucil , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil employ , corticosteroid-sparing effect overall benefit BP highly dispute . 70 % relapse usually observe within three month , 85 % within 6 month stop therapy . Since eosinophil characteristically find skin early stage disease blister occur contribute tissue damage , target eosinophil reduce number activation might thus promise alternative therapeutic approach . Anti-IL-5 antibody therapy show effective depleting eosinophil , e.g . diseases eosinophilic esophagitis hypereosinophilic syndrome . Objective To determine safety efficacy mepolizumab patient bullous pemphigoid . Methods clinical trial 750 mg mepolizumab three month , evaluate time period start therapy relapse , ABSIS-Score , Pruritus Score , Antibody level , immuno pathological evaluation skin biopsy .</detailed_description>
