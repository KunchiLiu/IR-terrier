	<brief_title>Furosemide Treatment Before Blood Transfusion Patients With Systolic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 4 million patient receive blood transfusion year United States , many suffer congestive heart failure . The reported prevalence anemia CHF unknown , range widely 4 % 70 % , due lack establish , consistent definition anemia CHF . Treating CHF patient furosemide prior blood transfusion become common practice , even though randomize clinical trial examine issue . Nand et al . measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 20 adult chronic severe anemia ( Hg &lt; 6 mg/dl ) systemic disease transfusion 700ml whole blood . Ten patient treat furosemide ( 40 mg intra-venous ) immediately prior transfusion . The PCWP increase significantly among patient receive furosemide decrease 3.75 % among patient furosemide group , although change statistically significant . In another study , group Nand et al . measure PCWP among 40 chronic anemia patient receive blood transfusion . None patient suffer cardiopulmonary disease . The patient randomly divide 4 group : difference first 3 group speed transfusion ( 2 ml/min , 5 ml/min 10 ml/min ) . The fourth group patient treat 40 mg furosemide transfusion give rate 5 ml/min . The PCWP increase significantly first 3 group , rise proportionately great fast transfusion ( 15.8 , 20.9 32.2 % group A , B C , respectively ) . In furosemide group , however , PCWP decrease significantly 21.7 % .</detailed_description>
