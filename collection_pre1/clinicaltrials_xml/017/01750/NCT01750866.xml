	<brief_summary>Cabazitaxel already approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient advanced prostrate cancer , follow docetaxel therapy . The purpose study well understand response toxicity cabazitaxel elderly men ( age 75 year old ) advance prostate cancer progress treatment docetaxel . All patient study receive cabazitaxel intravenous ( vein ) infusion plus prednisone mouth twice daily , follow chemotherapy infusion , injection granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . G-CSF help body produce white blood cell , help decrease risk get infection treat cabazitaxel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single arm , open label , phase II trial cabazitaxel every 3 week patient ≥ 75 year age castration-resistant , metastatic prostate cancer progress docetaxel . Primary objective : -The primary objective determine efficacy cabazitaxel men 75 year age old castration-resistant , metastatic prostate cancer progress follow treatment docetaxel . Secondary objective : - To characterize safety tolerability cabazitaxel patient ≥ 75 year age - To determine PSA response - To determine effect cabazitaxel functional status use geriatric assessment Exploratory objective : - Determine effect therapy cabazitaxel number circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) - To measure effect cabazitaxel apoptosis CTCs patient ≥ 75 year age use H2AX M30 biomarkers . - To determine relationship geriatric-focused assessment comorbidity functional ability toxicity response . Patients receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 week 10 mg prednisone daily progression , intolerance therapy , withdrawal consent . Patients receive granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( Neulasta 6 mg sc ) cycle , start first cycle , minimize risk complication neutropenia . Patients follow 28 day discontinuation therapy death , whichever occur first . Patients serious adverse event time removal trial follow toxicity resolve deem irreversible treat physician .</detailed_description>
