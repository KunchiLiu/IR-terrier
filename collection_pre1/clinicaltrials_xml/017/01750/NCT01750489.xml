	<brief_summary>The objective project well understand cause exercise limitation , dyspnea neurohumoral activation patient COPD . In particular , investigator aim explore mutual interaction neurohumoral activation exercise limitation thereby focus differential effect peripheral muscle diaphragm . Eventually finding might influence treatment modality . If sympathetic activation contributes exercise limitation drug influence autonomic nervous system would reasonable therapeutic concept . If reduction sympathetic activity due alteration ergoreflex achieve non-invasive ventilation would help improve dyspnea exercise capacity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Dysfunction Patients With Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( COPD ) : Role Sympathetic Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our aim investigate whether reduced exercise capacity , increase respiratory drive dyspnoea link heighten sympathetic activation rest exercise patient COPD . Furthermore , effect unload respiratory muscle use non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) assess . Fifteen stable COPD patient without NIV match 15 healthy control subject ( sufficient microneurography record ) . Furthermore COPD patient regular NIV study . Each participant undergo symptom limit bicycle exercise handgrip protocol . Microneurography use quantify sympathetic activity transcutaneous registration postganglionic sympathetic efferent .</detailed_description>
