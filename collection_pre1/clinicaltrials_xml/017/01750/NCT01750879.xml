	<brief_summary>The unifying objective project determine whether peanut oral immunotherapy ( PN OIT ) induce clinical tolerance context food allergy significantly associate expansion specific regulatory T cell subset ( CD45RA- CD25++ FoxP3++ ) think inducible gut-associated lymphoid compartment associate immunological tolerance . The hypothesis study induction Treg cell associate clinical tolerance . The investigator measure change baseline induce Treg cell frequency total CD4 T cell active treatment compare participant achieve significant clinical tolerance ( Tolerance Partial Tolerance Groups define ) ( Treatment Failure Group ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical Objectives : 1 . To evaluate whether PN OIT induces increase tolerance , define statistically significant increase median elicit dose ( ED ) double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) treatment PN OIT subsequent allergen avoidance . 2 . To evaluate whether PN OIT induce clinical desensitization , define 1 ) median 10-fold great increase ED DBPCFC PN OIT treatment period 2 ) statistically significant high median ED DBPCFC follow treatment period active control treatment ; 3 ) significantly low frequency accidental ingestion reaction active versus control treatment . 3 . To evaluate safety PN OIT . Mechanistic Objectives : 1 . To determine whether PN OIT induce statistically significant increase TCR clonal diversity Treg population active treatment among participant achieve increase clinical tolerance ( Tolerance Partial Tolerance Groups define clinical endpoint ) versus Treatment Failure Group . 2 . To determine whether PN OIT suppress mast cell induce significant suppression median ED end-point dilution skin test actively treat participant end maintenance therapy . 3 . To determine whether PN OIT suppress basophil define 10-fold suppression peanut-specific basophil ED actively treat participant end maintenance period . 4 . To determine whether either mast cell basophil suppression end maintenance therapy significantly associate clinical outcome follow avoidance . Exploratory Objectives : 1 . To describe gene expression profile clonal diversity regulatory effector T cell subset OIT good understand phenotype ontogeny subset potentially discover new therapeutic pathway . 2 . To engineer human MHC class II tetramers common HLA background map T cell epitopes dominant peanut allergen use validate earlier finding future study peanut-specific immune response human .</detailed_description>
