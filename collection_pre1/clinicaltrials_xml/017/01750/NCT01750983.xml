	<detailed_description>Study Groups : Dose escalation : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level study drug base join study . Up 5 dose level ipilimumab lenalidomide test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose ipilimumab lenalidomide find . Dose expansion : Once high tolerable dose ipilimumab lenalidomide find , 14 participant may enrol . This study safety combination drug dose level effectiveness study drug certain tumor group . This group call dose expansion group . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You take lenalidomide mouth Days 1-21 cycle . You swallow capsule whole water day . Do break , chew , open capsule . The doctor discus . You receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 cycle . You monitor side effect 1-2 hour infusion . Study Visits : Every study visit : ° You ask side effect . Cycle 1 : - On Day 1 : blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Between Days 2 7 : If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . - Between Days 8 14 : Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test .

Every cycle ( every 8 week ) : ° You x-ray , CT scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . ° Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn tumor marker test . Before start Cycle 3 follow cycle : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask health problem may drug herbal supplement may take . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Blood may draw often doctor think need . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . At End study : - Directly end study : If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . - 28 day therapy lenalidomide stop : If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Length Dosing : You may receive 4 dos ipilimumab . You may continue receive lenalidomide long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You study follow-up visit . Follow-up : You follow-up-visit within 30 day last dose study drug . You ask health problem may side effect . If study doctor think need , may follow-up long period time . If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . This investigational study . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treat metastatic melanoma . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treat multiple myeloma myelodysplastic syndrome . Giving combination ipilimumab lenalidomide patient advance cancer investigational .
