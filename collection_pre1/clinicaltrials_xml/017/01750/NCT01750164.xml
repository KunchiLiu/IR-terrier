	<brief_summary>This study use tissue body fluid acquire standard procedure part patient 's care cancer , surgery remove tumor tissue needle withdrawal body fluid contain cancer cell . The tissue cell inject immune compromise mice tissue allow grow tumor 1-1.5 cm size . The tissue extract either frozen , embed paraffin , use engraftment another generation mouse . The second generation mouse separate group give various treatment . Tissue participant mouse establish tumor , mouse either receive treatment receive treatment , use evaluate level various gene assist regulate cell growth cell death . The tumor tissue participant mouse also test random change genetic material compare participant 's blood determine change genetic material correlate well engraftment patient tissue mouse . It anticipate 10-30 % successful engraftment tumor tissue</brief_summary>
