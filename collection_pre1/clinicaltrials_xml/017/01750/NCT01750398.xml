	<detailed_description>This open-label , single site , single arm pilot study design determine efficacy safety alternate androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) parenteral testosterone men recurrent newly metastatic prostate cancer . Eligible patient initiate ADT Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( e.g . goserelin leuprolide ) surgically castrate total 6 month . After initial 6 month lead-in phase , patient continue ADT every three month also receive intramuscular gluteal injection either testosterone cypionate testosterone enanthanate ( T ) dose 400 mg every 4 week total 3 injection ( i.e.12 week therapy ) .Both formulation T identical pharmacokinetics ; exhibit serum testosterone profile intramuscular injection healthy volunteer . Patients cycle back ADT 12 week . This route dose T select base data demonstrate produce initial supraphysiologic serum level testosterone ( i.e . &gt; 3-8 time normal level ) eugonadal level achieve end two week return low serum T level fourth week post-injection . The investigator term rapid cycling supraphysiologic low/castrate serum T Bipolar Androgen-based Therapy ( BAT ) . One BAT cycle define 24 week ( i.e . 12 week T ; 12 week T ) . Patients receive two cycle ( i.e . 48 week ) BAT total ( see Study Scheme ) . Upon completion 18 month study period patient assessed response option continue intermittent continuous ADT discretion treat physician . Patients prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) image study screen period . A second set study perform end 6-month LHRH agonist therapy lead-in period . Based prior study investigator expect &gt; 80 % patient PSA &lt; 4 ng/ml without evidence PSA progression 6 month ADT ( Hussain et al . 2006 ; Crook et al . 2012 ) . At end lead-in phase patient either achieve ≥50 % reduction PSA screening baseline ( i.e . major PSA response ) PSA &lt; 4 ng/ml without sign progression allow continue study . All others remove study replace . Those replaced individual consider meet primary endpoint final analysis . PSA progression assess end 18 month study period . Standard Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) criteria PSA progression use ( Scher et al . 2008 ) . The primary endpoint trial percent subject PSA &lt; 4 ng/ml without PSA progression end 18 month treatment period . Secondary endpoint include : rate progression base image clinical assessment , percent patient complete PSA response ( PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/ml ) , metabolic change , change quality life assess standard questionnaire , safety . CT bone scan perform end second full cycle BAT ( i.e . end 18 month study period ) use assess radiographic progression . Soft tissue metastasis evaluate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ( v1.1 ) . Bone metastasis evaluate per standard PCWG2 criterion . This require appearance least 2 new lesion confirmatory bone scan . For patient demonstrate radiographic progression investigator require confirmatory scan additional 8 week misconstrue tumor flare true disease progression . A subject consider clinically progressed develops pain , opinion investigator , secondary cancer ; develop pathologic fracture skeletal event . If uncertainty regard whether symptom due patient 's cancer , subsequent workup investigator 's discretion . Of endpoint , clinical progression result early study termination . To evaluate effect BAT metabolic syndrome associate ADT investigator monitor number parameter baseline prior initiation ADT , 6 month `` Lead-in '' phase ADT 2nd cycle T. Studies include measurement bone density , estradiol , sex hormone binding globulin , fast lipid , metabolic parameter ( insulin , fast glucose , hemoglobin A1c , leptin , TSH , T3 , fibrinogen , C-reactive protein , serum C-telopeptide , blood pressure , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , body weight ) . Quality life ( QOL ) record series questionnaire . These survey include RAND-SF36 Quality Life Survey , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Prostate Cancer ( FACT-P ) , International Index Erectile Function ( IIEF ) , International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) visual pain scale . Each instrument previously validate use extensively clinical trial assess effect treatment intervention quality life . QOL assess screening , Lead-In Phase end cycle T ADT . Additional plasma serum sample draw bank -80°C baseline prior initiation ADT , prior initiate cycle T ADT upon completion study . These sample use biologic immunologic correlate . Examples study may perform include , limited : quantitative immunoglobulin , T-cell receptor excision circle ( TREC ) level circulate DNA study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year 2 . Performance status ≤2 . 3 . Documented histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . 4 . No prior AD therapy ( i.e . surgical castration LHRH agonist , LHRH antagonist ) treatment recurrent metastatic disease ( may receive neoadjuvant , concurrent and/or adjuvant AD therapy context definitive local therapy administer ≥ 1 year prior recurrence ) . 5 . No prior treatment second line hormonal therapy ( flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , ketoconazole , abiraterone acetate MDV3100 ) permit . 6 . Prior treatment 5alpha reductase inhibitor ( e.g . finasteride dutasteride ) treatment benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) permit , patient must therapy ≥ 6 month prior enrol study 7 . No prior treatment chemotherapeutic regimen allow . 8 . Prior treatment nonhormonal investigational agent permit . 9 . Evidence rise PSA two successive date &gt; 2 week apart . There maximum minimum PSA requirement come study . 10 . Patients must ≤ 10 total site bone metastases evidence lung liver parenchymal metastasis document within 28 day enrollment trial 11 . Patient may lymph node metastasis single lymph node &gt; 5 cm short axis diameter 12 . Patients must asymptomatic site pain due prostate cancer . 1 . Evidence serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric condition ( include laboratory abnormality ) could interfere patient safety provision inform consent participate study . 2 . Any psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition could potentially interfere compliance study protocol followup schedule . 3 . Evidence disease , opinion investigator , would put patient risk testosterone therapy ( e.g . femoral metastasis concern fracture risk , spinal metastasis concern spinal cord compression , lymph node disease concern ureteral obstruction ) . 4 . Requires urinary catheterization void result tumor obstruct urinary outflow tract ; catheterization permit due nononcologic cause ( e.g urethral stricture atonic bladder ) . 5 . No prior history deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 5 year prior enrollment study 6 . Abnormal liver function ( bilirubin , AST , ALT ≥ 3 x upper limit normal ) 7 .
