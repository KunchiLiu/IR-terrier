	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess scar-formation wound heal follow use autologous fat graft facial reconstruction patient . Patients undergone facial reconstruction last 3 month randomize two group , one receiving fat graft one receive intervention . These patient continue follow-up clinic one year , 3-D image take follow-up visit ass scar formation wound heal . Assessment scar undertaken healthcare personnel well general lay public . We hypothesize patient undergo fat graft wound site achieve aesthetically appeal result , less scar improve wound heal judged general public healthcare professional .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A variety local regional skin flap use reconstruction skin defect face intention full wound closure , healing , scar minimization . Scarring unavoidable consequence wound healing , especially significant facial reconstruction . Fibroblasts migrate injurious site proliferate deposit collagen . The collagenous protein serve fill wound defect allow epithelial cell accumulate repopulate skin surface . The collagenous base subsequently exchange various type collagen crosslinked . Although scar formation important component wound healing , patient develop scar differently base upon location biology subject . Excessive scar formation may result excessive collagen production inadequate collagen remodeling ( Gurtner ) . Much effort focus minimize scar formation . Such technique include rigorous sterilization technique , small , linear incision , incision follow normal tension line skin name . However , technique mostly limit intraoperative pre-operative measure . And successful minimizing scar burden , technique address scar management post operatively . Wound heal scar formation follow complex biological process dependent inflammatory cell growth factor . It show utero fetal wound capable scarless heal phase gestation wound heal paucity inflammatory cell ( Soo , Frantz ) . This principle study immune deficient mouse lack macrophage neutrophil , critical inflammatory response . Within experiment , group mice ( immunodeficient normal mouse ) heal wound , immunodeficient mouse scarless manner ( Mori , Martin ) . Extrapolating information current surgical patient , development immunomodulating measure critical inhibiting manage scar formation . Adipose derive mesenchymal stem cell ( ADSCs ) study regard role wound heal scar formation process show great promise . In experimental study , ADSCs show promote angiogenesis , granulation reepithelialization overlie wound ( Ebrahimian ) . Whether directly indirectly process , ADSCs also improve appearance resultant scar decrease size , contrast scar color , improve pliability scar ( Blanton , Yun ) . However , confuse adipose tissue equivalent ADSCs . Rather , ADSCs particular line cell find within adipose tissue unique capability differentiate variety type tissue , bone cartilage adipose tissue ( Zuk ) . These cell capable harvest culture adipose tissue within subject subsequently inject wound site interest . Fat graft similar less involved technique harvest autologous adipose tissue use cell culture technique isolate ADSCs cell lineage . Fat graft long use technique concurrently facial reconstruction procedure facial rejuvenation procedure `` filler '' sort facial augmentation early 1893 ( Miller ) . The fat inject face serf volume expander correct defect related loss muscle bone , micrognathia . Since initial trial , technique widely expand hone provide best possible contouring . In addition filler aspect result procedure , technique observe improve skin quality injection site , improve pigmentation irregularity , even improve appearance long stand scar . However , formal study fat graft 's potential improve wound heal minimization scar formation never undertaken . Although identical process injection autologous ADSCs , process fat graft capability provide number ADSCs adipose harvest . Additionally , process show past improve previously exist scar improve quality skin overlie injection site ( Coleman ) . Therefore , logical assume injection autologous fat improve wound heal minimize scar formation patient undergoing procedure effect ADSCs within harvest tissue . With advent advanced 3-D imaging technology , able obtain high-quality , high-resolution image document detail stage wound heal scar formation . Therefore , able determine observer analysis whether process fat graft change formation quality scar time .</detailed_description>
