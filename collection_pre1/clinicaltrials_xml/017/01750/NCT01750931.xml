	<brief_title>This Study Randomised , Single Oral Dose Bioequivalence Study Meloxicam GSK 15 MG Tablets .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study : To demonstrate bioequivalence Meloxicam GSK 15 mg tablet manufacture Savipharm J.S.C , Vietnam Mobic® 15 mg tablet Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &amp; Co.KG Binger Str.173 , 5521 Ingelheim Rhein , Germany , healthy adult human male subject feed condition To monitor safety study subject . Study design : A randomized , balance , open label , crossover , two period , two treatment , two sequence , single dose , oral bioequivalence study feed condition . It pivotal study Sample size estimation : Based literature available [ Public assesment report Scientific Discussion Meloxicam `` Arrow '' Tablets 7.5 15 mg Meloxicam , DK/H/0905/001-002/MR ] sample size 28 subject enough meet study objective . And 28 healthy adult human male subject enrol . Screening procedure : Demographic data , medical medication history , complete physical examination , height , weight BMI well 12 lead ECG , chest X-ray [ PA view ] , vital sign [ blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate oral temperature ] , hematology , biochemistry , HIV1 &amp; 2 , Hepatitis B C , RPR test Syphilis urine analysis do screening . Urine drug screen , Liver chemistry test Breath alcohol test do prior check-in . Breath alcohol test do prior ambulatory visit blood collection . Housing : The study subject house least 11 h prior drug administration 24 h blood sample study period . The housing follow three ambulatory visit [ 48 , 72 96 hr post dose ] period . Study Meals Supervised fast least 10 h dose day breakfast maintain period . High calorie high fat breakfast serve subject start consum 30 minute schedule dosing time . After dose lunch , snack dinner serve 5 , 8 12 h respectively . Meal plan identical study period . Water permit ad libitum except 1 h 1 h post-dose . Drug Administration : As per randomization schedule , one tablet either test reference product orally administer subject period sit posture , 30 minute start consume serve high calorie high fat breakfast overnight fast least 10 h. The investigational product administer 240 ± 2 mL water . Subjects instruct chew crush tablet swallow . Compliance dose assessed identification subject subject ID card , identification label investigational product confirm correct allocation treatment check oral cavity immediately dose . Restrictions Subjects remain upright position [ sit ambulatory ] two hour dose period except clinically indicate change posture . The subject fast least 10 h prior dose day breakfast 5 h post-dose . Water permit ad libitum except 1 h 1 h post dose . Blood sampling : In period study , 26 blood sample 6 mL collect K2EDTA vacutainers via indwell catheter place one forearm vein . Heparin-lock technique use prevent clot blood indwelling catheter . Before in-house blood sample drawn catheter , 0.5 mL blood discard purge heparin contain blood sample catheter . Blood also collect direct venipuncture case cannula blockage , ambulatory visit practical reason . The two pre-dose blood sample collect within period 1 h drug administration . The post-dose blood sample collect 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0 , 4.5 , 5.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 , 6.5 , 7.0 , 7.5 , 8.0 , 9.0 , 10.0 , 12.0 , 16.0 , 24.0 , 48.0 , 72.0 96.0 h. The 48.0 , 72.0 96.0 h post dose blood sample collect ambulatory visit direct venipuncture . Immediately collection blood , sample keep ice bath . After collect blood sample subject sampling time point , sample centrifuge 4oC 3500 rpm 10 minute . The plasma sample separate duplicate store pre-labeled polypropylene tube -70 ± 10°C colder pending assay . The time interval sample collection start centrifugation exceed 45 minute . The total volume blood drawn include volume necessary laboratory test , PK sample analysis volume blood discard house blood draw 360 mL per subject entire study . Washout Period : Washout period least 14 day , exceed 21 day two dosing day . Pharmacokinetic Parameter : Cmax , Tmax , AUC0-t , AUC0-∞ , AUC % _Extrap , Kel t1/2 Analytical Methods : Meloxicam plasma estimate use validated LC-MS/MS method . Statistical Methods : Statistical analysis do use SAS® version 9.2 high . Analysis variance [ ANOVA ] log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter [ Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ ] two one-sided test [ Schuirmann ] bioequivalence perform . Power , ratio 90 % confidence interval log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter - Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ calculate . Standards Bioequivalence : The calculated 90 % Confidence Interval test reference ratio Meloxicam fall within range 80 % -125 % log transform Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ conclusion bioequivalence . Adverse Events The investigator site staff responsible detecting , document report event meet definition AE SAE . AEs collect start Study Treatment follow-up contact . Medical occurrence begin prior start study treatment obtain informed consent may record Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF . SAEs collect time period state AEs . However , SAEs assess related study participation ( e.g . study treatment , protocol-mandated procedure , invasive test , change exist therapy ) relate GSK concomitant medication record time subject consent participate study include follow-up contact . All SAEs record report sponsor within 24 hour . Investigators obligate actively seek AEs SAEs former study participant . However , investigator learns SAE , include death , time subject discharge study , considers event reasonably related study treatment study participation , investigator would promptly notify sponsor .</detailed_description>
