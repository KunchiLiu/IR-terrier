	<detailed_description>`` The Study System single-use system consist two part : Drug Unit contain 10.8 mg fentanyl hydrochloride , Controller supply dose current . The two part package separately assemble immediately prior use . The Study System apply upper , out arm subject . Fentanyl deliver Study System via transdermal iontophoresis use current 170 mcAmp ( Treatment B ) , 140 mcAmp ( Treatment C ) , 200 mcAmp ( Treatment D ) , 230 mcAmp ( Treatment E ) . Each subject randomly assign treatment sequence consist Treatment A ( IV fentanyl citrate ) , Study System Treatment B ( 170 mcAmp ) , one three additional Study System treatments consist Treatment C ( 140 mcAmp ) , Treatment D ( 200 mcAmp ) , Treatment E ( 230 mcAmp ) . Each subject therefore receive total three treatment ( A B either C , D , E ) . The specific treatment outline detail : - Treatment A : Fentanyl citrate ( equivalent 80 mcg fentanyl ) administer 20 minute IV infusion every hour 23.33 hour . - Treatment B : Two consecutive 40 mcg fentanyl dos deliver 10 minute Study System ( 170 mcAmp ) every hour 23.33 hour . - Treatment C : Two consecutive 35 mcg fentanyl dos , deliver 10 minute Study System ( 140 mcAmp ) every hour 23.33 hour . - Treatment D : Two consecutive 50 mcg fentanyl dos , deliver 10 minute Study System ( 200 mcAmp ) every hour 23.33 hour . - Treatment E : Two consecutive 54 mcg fentanyl dos , deliver 10 minute Study System ( 230 mcAmp ) every hour 23.33 hour . Naltrexone ( 50 mg ) administer orally ( PO ) every 12 hour , begin 14 hour start fentanyl treatment end approximately 11 hour completion treatment ``</detailed_description>
