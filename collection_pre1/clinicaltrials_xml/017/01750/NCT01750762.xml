	<brief_summary>This research Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve lenalidomide type cancer . Lenalidomide drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , study determine effect lenalidomide growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide approve FDA treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental . There participant multiple myeloma lymphoma long remission bone marrow/stem cell transplantation another person . This believed effect donor 's immune system reaction recipient 's multiple myeloma cell . It hop due lenalidomide alter immune system , might able potentiate reaction . This study do determine use lenalidomide safe transplant participant facilitate immune reaction result regression myeloma lymphoma . During study evaluate side effect treatment lenalidomide ( include graft versus host disease ) response myeloma treatment . There two group participant study . The first group treat relatively low dose lenalidomide . If find safe second group treat high dose</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree participate research study ask undergo screening test procedure find eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : complete medical history , physical examination , blood collection , disease assessment , bone marrow aspirate , electrocardiogram HIV/Hepatitis blood test . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant lenalidomide , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . The total duration treatment study 12 week three cycle 28 day . At begin cycle receive lenalidomide capsule need take cycle . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide seek emergency medical care need contact study staff immediately . Females childbearing potential may care touch lenalidomide capsule bottle unless wear glove . During treatment see clinic every two week . At every visit follow perform : Complete medical history physical exam , blood collection research blood testing . If myeloma , begin cycle undergo disease assessment blood urine test . Any unused Revlimid ( lenalidomide ) return instructed RevAssist program . After complete take drug study , follow procedure test take place : Complete medical history physical examination , blood collection , disease assessment , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy research blood test . You study treatment three month follow every three month treatment end two year .</detailed_description>
