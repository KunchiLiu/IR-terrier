	<brief_summary>Obesity become global epidemic , treat prevent obesity appear one world 's great challenge . The disorder associate wide range metabolic hormonal change , include development insulin resistance , change adipose tissue function , increased level blood lipid , cardiovascular disease obesity induce fatty liver . Obesity characterize inflammation adipose tissue , alter fat storage capacity increase exchange lipid adipose tissue blood , increase secretion cytokine adipose tissue . Cytokines believe play central role regulation adipose tissue , size adipocytes metabolic condition . The hepatic synthesis lipoproteins interaction adipose tissue essential body 's energy storage . The central role liver energy supply , fat storage normalization blood value implies importance investigate interaction adipose tissue liver increase knowledge morbidity obesity . Central obesity insulin resistance clear risk factor development fatty liver , importance diet unclear . The common perception fatty liver condition improve reduction dietary fat cholesterol , relationship unclear , contradictory finding occur epidemiological study . It therefore necessary good understand impact different macro-nutrients . The purpose study determine whether two weight reduce diet equal calorie level contain high low fat differentially affect adipose tissue function , distribution body fat , well tissue , blood urine level inflammatory marker , lipid , vitamin , hormone substance may relate metabolically health .</brief_summary>
