	<brief_summary>Objective : study effect Acupuncture liver cirrhosis , SVR health relate quality life HCV patient receive standard treatment ( Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin ) . Methods : 60 HCV patient receive standard treatment ( Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin ) undergo Serologic screen hepatitis C virus ( Anti-HCV EIAs and/or recombinant immunoblot assay ) plus Transient Ultrasound Elastography ( FibroScan ) achieve baseline characteristic ( 17,18,19 ) . Patients randomized intervention control group , 30 patient each.In Intervention group patient receive acupuncture treatment week 12 consecutive week ( Max 12 , Min 8 treatment ) . Treatment protocol individualize patient accord TCM diagnosis . This treatment protocol acceptable publish ( 20,21,22 ) .In control group patient receive standard treatment alone , intervention . Data collection : 12 week patient undergo Serologic screen hepatitis C virus ( Anti-HCV EIAs and/or recombinant immunoblot assay ) plus Transient Ultrasound Elastography ( FibroScan ) order detect change baseline group difference . Inclusion criterion : adult patient confirm HCV infection Exclusion criterion : Under 18 year Can receive standard Peg interferon+ ribavirin treatment reason Psychiatric diagnosis Anaemia hematologic origin Diabetic patient uncontrolled diabetes Congestive heart failure , arrhythmia Hepatocellular carcinoma HIV infection Hepatitis B infection Auto immune liver disease alcoholic liver disease Study duration : 1 year Study Location : `` Ziv '' medical center , division liver disease , Israel</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Hepatitis C infectious disease affect primarily liver , cause hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . HCV worldwide problem , An estimate 130-170 million people worldwide infect HCV , Israel estimate 80,000 patient . Most patient infected HCV chronic liver disease , progress cirrhosis Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Chronic infection HCV one important cause chronic liver disease common indication orthotropic liver transplantation ( OLT ) United States . Medical care cost associate treatment HCV infection United States estimate $ 600 million year . Chronic hepatitis C infection chronic active hepatitis slowly progressive disease result severe morbidity 20-30 % infected person . Although acute HCV infection usually mild , chronic hepatitis result least 75 % patient . Cirrhosis develop 20-50 % patient chronic hepatitis C infection . Liver failure Hepatocellular carcinoma eventually result . Hepatocellular carcinoma occur 11-19 % patient . The diagnosis acute chronic HCV infection generally require test serum antibody HCV ( anti-HCV ) HCV RNA . The recombinant immunoblot assay use confirm HCV infection . A sensitive quantitative HCV RNA assay recommend diagnosis also provide information level virus helpful management disease . Combination therapy pegylated interferon Alfa ( PEG-IFN Alfa ) nucleoside analogue ribavirin current standard care patient infect HCV . Treatment chronic HCV infection 2 goal . The first achieve sustain eradication HCV ( ie , sustain virologic response [ SVR ] ) , define persistent absence HCV RNA serum 6 month complete antiviral treatment . The second goal prevent progression cirrhosis , Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , decompensated liver disease require liver transplantation . Adverse effect common IFN ribavirin combination therapy . Approximately 75 % patient experience one adverse effect . Common adverse effect : 1 . Flulike symptoms 2 . Hematologic complication ( ie , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia ) 3 . Depression 4 . Low grade fever , 5 . Nausea , loss weight 6 . Neuropsychiatric complication ( ie , memory concentration disturbance , visual disturbance , headache , irritability ) 7 . Metabolic complication ( gout ) . Adverse event major reason patient decline stop therapy altogether . Currently limit option manage side effect , especially problematic flu like symptom depression . Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) find effective treatment improve quality life various medical condition include hepatitis . TCM also positively affect chronic inflammation improve inflammation marker chronic inflammatory disease asthma , crohn 's disease , sinusitis chronic pelvic inflammation . Acupuncture 's effect liver cirrhosis , SVR ( sustain Viral Response ) health relate quality life chronic HCV patient yet study . Study Aim : study effect acupuncture adjunctive treatment chronic HCV patient receive standard treatment ( Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin ) .</detailed_description>
