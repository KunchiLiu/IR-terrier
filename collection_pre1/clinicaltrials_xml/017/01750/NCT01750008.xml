	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare outcomes two uterine-conserving treatment alternative symptomatic uterine fibroid : laparoscopic myomectomy ( LM ) global fibroid ablation ( GFA ) use Halt System . Laparoscopic ultrasound ( LUS ) standard step prior GFA procedure standard step prior LM . Incorporating laparoscopic ultrasound first step prior treatment allow surgeon equal access valuable image information plan treatment accordingly . By randomize subject immediately laparoscopic ultrasound , selection bias toward one treatment follow LUS eliminate .</brief_summary>
