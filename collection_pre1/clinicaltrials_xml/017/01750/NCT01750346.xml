	<brief_summary>Background : - Blepharospasm cause excessive contraction muscle close eye . One treatment botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) , work weaken muscle . Like BoNT , acetyl hexapeptide-8 ( AH-8 ) work weaken muscle , available skin cream . AH-8 active ingredient number cosmetic cream use treat wrinkle . Researchers think AH-8 cream could use treat blepharospasm , original dose study effective . They want try high dose AH-8 cream see effective treatment . Objectives : - To see AH-8 cream improve symptom blepharospasm . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age blepharospasm severe enough require treatment . Design : - This study involve eight study visit . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They answer question symptom . They also blink test see severe blepharospasm . At visit , participant receive one three type cream . One cream low dose AH-8 , one high dose AH-8 , placebo ( AH-8 ) . - One month later , participant followup visit , test similar first visit . They also receive cream . - One month later , participant another visit test . They videotape visit study facial movement . Those respond treatment continue use cream . Those respond offer chance BoNT injection , stop take cream . - One month later , participant BoNT injection final visit check possible side effect . Those continued take cream continue study . - The fifth sixth visit involve test . At seventh visit , remain participant offer chance BoNT injection , stop take cream . - The final visit check side effect cream injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Test efficacy topical AH-8 blepharospasm treatment . DESIGN : This randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study , phase II single center clinical trial . Patients primary blepharospasm least 4 month BoNT therapy benefit last BoNT injection history self assesment include . We use 3 study arm placebo 2 different dos ( concentration AH-8 active substance topical preparation ) . An extension phase plan initial phase . The patient baseline screen visit , include measurement outcome variable , begin study intervention . They 2 subsequent visit month 1 month 2 . After visit , patient significant benefit wish alternative therapy ( GROUP 1 ) receive BoNT injection accord best practice standard . These patient assess 1 month later ( peak effect BoNT therapy ) effect compare AH-8 effect . The patient significant benefit ( GROUP 2 ) continue therapy another 4 month ( total 6 month ) , another assessment point . Afterwards patient offer BoNT injection accord best practice standard , similar Group 1 , another assessment make one month later ( month 7 ) compare effect AH-8 effect . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome variable : Jankovic Blepharospasm Rating Scale month 2 . Secondary outcome variable : - Jankovic Blepharospasm Rating Scale month 1 - Blepharospasm Disability Scale month 1 - Blepharospasm Disability Scale month 2 - difference JBRS month 3 time point ( BoNT injection ) patient receive BoNT - JBRS score 6 month patient receive BoNT month 2 ( Group 2 ) - difference JBRS month 6 month 7 time point ( BoNT injection ) Group 2 patient - Blink reflex measure month 2 Non-parametric comparison ( Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test ) primary secondary variable intervention use statistical analysis . Additional multivariate analysis explore influence factor ( age , gender , disease duration ) . Interventions Duration Twice daily application active substance placebo . Two active substance concentration , 0.025 % 0.05 % AH-8 use . Each subject study total least 3 month , follow additional 4 month second phase group 2 patient . Sample Size Population There 8 patient per arm , total study population 24 . The power calculation power 80 % , 2-tailed alpha 0.05 , able detect change 2 point JBRS require 8 patient per arm . This calculation base independent calculation dose active agent placebo . The subject include patient primary blepharospasm , currently treat BoNT ( de novo diagnosed patient ) , subjectively express wish treatment intervention , least one year history symptom onset , without perceive active change symptom history . Patients blepharospasm part generalize dystonia due different neurologic condition exclude . Randomization blind perform NIH research pharmacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Primary blepharospasm diagnose confirmed Movement Disorders Neurologist , confirm initial visit study investigator . Individuals BoNT therapy least 4 month eligible study . Severity prompt need treatment determine clinical judgment At least score 4 JBRS At least score 8 BDS Duration symptoms least 1 year , without subjective active progression patient report Concomitant therapy allow , except injectable BoNT therapy , provide dos remain stable throughout study period Adult patient ( &gt; 18 ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Blepharospasm associate generalized extensive regional dystonia Medical condition impair patient 's ability comply study protocol perform daily application cream instruct judged recruiting physician Local eyelid pathology preclude topical treatment Received BoNT within 4 month prior enrollment Continued benefit prior BoNT injection ( history self assesment ) Current use cosmetic wrinkle cream Prior myectomy procedure exclude Pregnant woman exclude . Barrier contraception use throughout study woman childbearing age , know use hormonal contraceptive may interact study substance . Menopausal status determine CNS IRB criterion . In woman childbearing potential , pregnancy test perform initial visit periodically every 2 month duration study . Barrier contraception deem necessary duration study none . Use treatment blepharospasm allow dos remain constant Allergy/sensitivity study substance vehicle . Active drug alcohol abuse dependence Patients uncontrolled coexist medical condition : uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100 ; active heart disease need immediate intervention ; active respiratory disease need intervention ; know observe eye pathology ; condition would render patient unable safely cooperate study test judge screen physician Cognitive inability independently use cr ( SqrRoot ) ( Registered Trademark ) use safely .</criteria>
