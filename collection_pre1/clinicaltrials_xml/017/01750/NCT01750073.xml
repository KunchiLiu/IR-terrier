	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well give paclitaxel cyclophosphamide without trastuzumab surgery work treat patient previously untreated stage I-III breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving combination chemotherapy without trastuzumab surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Cyclophosphamide With Without Trastuzumab Before Surgery Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity tolerability neoadjuvant dose-dense regimen cyclophosphamide paclitaxel without trastuzumab/radiation therapy ( clinically indicate ) patient newly diagnose stage T1cN0 II-III breast cancer ; follow maintenance trastuzumab human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive OR Adriamycin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) follow radiation therapy ( RT ) stage II-III triple negative HER2 ( - ) , estrogen receptor ( ER ) ( - ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) ( - ) stage T1cN0 II-III breast cancer patient . II . To determine pathological complete response rate ( pCR ) treatment regimen . III . To identify possible gene expression profile signature whole genome array analysis correlate clinical response/resistance chemotherapy measure pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) . OUTLINE : NEOADJUVANT THERAPY : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients HER2-positive cancer also receive trastuzumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without metastasis undergo mastectomy breast conserve surgery 4-8 week later . POST-SURGERY/SYSTEMIC THERAPY : HER2-POSITIVE PATIENTS : Patients receive standard radiation therapy . Patients also receive trastuzumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ER/PR POSITIVE PATIENTS : Patients receive standard adjuvant hormonal endocrine therapy . STAGE T1cN0 TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS : Patients receive standard radiation therapy . STAGE II-III TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive standard radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
