	<detailed_description>Currently commercially available mechanism measurement blood flow velocity waveforms non-invasively . Blood flow velocity waveform require use invasive catheter , thus preclude clinical use . Such information would allow researcher / practitioner ability continuously measure blood flow , pulse pressure , pulsatility index vascular structure accessible ultrasound minimal additional risk subject / patient . This data , combine arterial blood pressure data , could also use measure peripheral pressure volume loop well aortic vascular impedance , currently measure vivo . The ability measure blood flow velocity waveform high temporal resolution would provide clinician new tool hemodynamic optimization ( novel mean estimate myocardial oxygen consumption [ pressure volume area ] well afterload [ aortic vascular impedance ] ) researcher ability conduct hemodynamic experiment previously possible . This work serve foundation several relate project depend ability continuously record blood flow velocity waveform .</detailed_description>
