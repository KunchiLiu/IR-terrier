	<detailed_description>A dysregulation lipid metabolism increase level free fatty acid ( FFA ) represent one key mechanism pathogenesis insulin resistance , contribute development type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . In case , dyslipidemia relate obesity metabolic syndrome . Not skeletal muscle glucose uptake , also hepatic glucose flux alter insulin resistant state . In obese T2D subject , rate gluconeogenesis ( GNG ) increase , obese normoglycemic subject endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) remain constant downregulation glycogenolysis ( GL ) . However , T2D subject , GNG GL elevate , contribute fast postprandial hyperglycemia . Therefore , elevate GNG rate may represent early event pathophysiology insulin resistance T2D . Preliminary study institute show intravenous lipid infusion subsequent elevation FFA result increase GNG rate without alteration EGP lean , non-diabetic subject . In another recent study investigate effect oral fat load hepatic insulin sensitivity . As expect , find alteration EGP ; however , rate GNG GL assess . The aim study analyze effect oral fat load transiently elevate level circulate lipid hepatic glucose flux , especially GNG GL , elucidate role dietary fat induction insulin resistance healthy human . In randomized , control cross-over study , effect oral palm oil canola oil ingestion investigate young , healthy lean subject . Hepatic glucose flux assess two independent method , vivo magnet resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) deuterated water/acetaminophen method , also allow determination glycogen cycling rate . Furthermore , hepatic phosphorus metabolite liver fat content monitor MRS .</detailed_description>
