	<detailed_description>Project Background : Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) consistently associate increase risk cognitive decline , mild cognitive impairment , dementia elderly . Even minor cognitive impairment nondemented individual dramatically affect disease self-management . This , turn , associate poor glycemic blood pressure control diabetes , increase risk dementia , provoke reinforce cycle disease . Thus , imperative find intervention delay prevent cognitive compromise diabetic patient , relatively easily rapidly implement , cost prohibitive . This especially true VA , view high incidence diabetes dementia grow population elderly Veterans . Epidemiologic evidence suggest modifiable life-style factor , include cognitive activity , may prevent delay onset cognitive decline . Computerized cognitive training ( CCT ) intervention show promising result improvement cognitive functioning , consistently non-demented elderly , additional benefit booster train session . To date , study CCT typically examine cognitive outcome , shortly intervention . The proposed CCT program , Personal Coach Cognifit , design improve cognition elderly person target weak cognitive function , use personally tailor training plan . The propose study provide first evaluation effect CCT DM self-management behavior clinical outcome , addition cognition . Project Objectives : Aim 1A : To determine whether CCT , relative active control game program , improve cognition ( memory executive functions/attention ) , DM-related behavior ( DM self-management medication adherence ) , clinical outcome ( glycemic blood pressure control ) , 6 12 month intervention . Aim 1B : To demonstrate efficacy improvement behavioral outcome ( DM self-management medication adherence ) 6 month intervention . Aim 2 : To document effect CCT successive change memory executive functions/attention , DM self-management medication adherence , glycemic blood pressure control . Aim 3 : To explore impact demographic ( age , education , ethnicity , site ) health ( ADL/IADL , health literacy , depression , dementia family history , lifestyle factor ) characteristic , intervention effect . Project Methods : Non-demented DM elderly James J. Peters ( Bronx , NY ) Ann Arbor ( MI ) VAMCs randomize CCT game intervention perform respective program 3 day per week ( every day ) , 20 minute , 24 total session . Four month intervention , subject receive 1-week booster training . Subjects assessed baseline ; immediately , 6 month , 12 month intervention . At time point , assessment cognitive function , DM self-management , blood pressure ; blood drawn HbA1c measurement . VA record use monitor medication adherence . Longitudinal mixed model analyse assess effect intervention change outcomes time . Path analyse evaluate inter-relationships among change cognition , DM self-management , clinical outcome intervention 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
