	<brief_summary>For patient start take antiretroviral medication ( treat HIV ) first time , variety different medicine may take together combination order form effective treatment suppresses virus prolong period time . Currently , national guideline recommend use two different drug one type ( nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor , NRTI often know `` nuke '' ) third drug one two type ( either nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , know NNRTI `` nonnuke '' , protease inhibitor , know PI ) form treatment regime three active drug . In UK Europe , PIs give combination small dose second PI , ritonavir , effect boosting level active PI bloodstream . The investigator know research study patient experience clinic combination ritonavirboosted PI NNRTI achieve similar result suppress HIV virus , compare use either PI NNRTI 2 NRTI described . In study , investigator observe combination two licensed antiretroviral medication , ritonavirboosted darunavir ( DRV/r ) rilpivirine ( RPV ) , suppress virus give patient commence treatment HIV infection first time . Both drug license treatment patient HIV UK Europe , currently standard clinical use . The study monitor treatment first 48 week . The investigator also examine level drug bloodstream first 4 week start regimen , confirm remain level investigator know effective virus .</brief_summary>

Disallowed concomitant medication per summary product characteristic darunavir rilpivirine ( see section 5.2 ) . Any genotypic resistance mutation screen prior test darunavir ( V11I , V32I , L33F , I47V , I50V , I54M , I54L , T74P , L76V , I84V L89V ) rilpivirine ( K101E , K101P , E138A , E138G , E138K , E138R , E138Q , V179L , Y181C , Y181I , Y181V , H221Y , F227C , M230I , M230L ) . Screening ALT AST elevation great 5 time upper limit normal . Any active opportunistic infection within 4 week prior plan baseline visit . Any active cardiovascular , pulmonary , hepatic , renal metabolic disease , therapy use treat disease , opinion investigator could affect absorption , distribution , metabolism efficacy study medication . Any known suspect allergic reaction investigational product excipients ( include E110 allergy regard darunavir tablet ) . Hepatitis B C coinfection ( define positive hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis C antibody ; patient positive hepatitis C antibody undetectable RNA eligible inclusion ) . Estimated GFR ( MDRD method ) less 50 ml/min Use proton pump inhibitor , H2 antagonists dailySubject one follow risk factor QTc prolongation : i. confirm prolongation QT/QTc interval , e.g. , repeat demonstration QTcF ( Fridericia correction ) interval &gt; 450 m screen ECG . ii . pathological Qwaves ( define Qwave &gt; 40 m depth &gt; 0.40.5 mV ) . iii . evidence ventricular preexcitation . iv . electrocardiographic evidence complete incomplete leave bundle branch block complete clinically significant incomplete right bundle branch block . v. evidence second third degree heart block . vi . intraventricular conduction delay QRS duration &gt; 120 ms. vii . bradycardia define sinus rate &lt; 50 bpm . viii . personal family history long QT syndrome . ix . personal history cardiac disease ( include congenital heart disease ) , symptomatic asymptomatic arrhythmia , exception sinus arrhythmia . x. syncopal episode . xi . risk factor Torsades de Pointes ( e.g. , heart failure , hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia ) .</criteria>
