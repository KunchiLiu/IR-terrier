	<brief_title>Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) Biomarkers Study Immediate Postnatal Period Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>October 2013 Enrollment Update : The healthy control enrollment fill close . The study still enrol eligible infant SMA . Aim 1 . To establish validity putative physiological SMA biomarkers immediate postnatal period . A longitudinal , natural history examination physiological marker muscle innervation perform healthy SMA infant . The first week life ideal first time point , visit occur schedule visit age two . Compound motor action potential ( CMAP ) amplitude electrical impedance myography ( EIM ) examine correlate motor function . Each associated muscle innervation provide information number function lower motor neuron spinal cord , cellular target SMA therapeutic intervention . This trial establish natural history putative SMA biomarkers disease evolves affect infant . Moreover , approach allow measurement pre-symptomatic early symptomatic subject determine predictive value . Aim 2 . To establish validity putative molecular SMA biomarkers immediate postnatal period.SMN2 copy number valid , predictive molecular SMA biomarker ; however , fix , therefore useful biomarker clinical progression response therapy . SMN mRNA protein expression variable different cell type , mouse , naturally decrease age postnatally . In study , SMN expression level measure longitudinally SMA patient control . Additional putative molecular SMA marker identify correlate motor function determine effort distinguish predictive marker change prior development weakness change consequence weakness .</detailed_description>
