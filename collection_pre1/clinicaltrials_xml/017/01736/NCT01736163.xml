	<criteria>Historical record patient meet follow criterion eligible inclusion retrospective evaluation : 1 . Male female patient live decease , age 18 year old time first ablation thyroid cancer . 2 . Diagnosed welldifferentiated T4 tumour ( defined primary tumour size extend beyond thyroid capsule [ may refer TNM classification T4 , N01 , M01 ] ) . This exclude unusual histological type oncocytic ( Hurthle cell carcinoma ) , tall cell , sclerosing cribriform thyroid cancer . 3 . Undergone neartotal total thyroidectomy 01 January 2000 4 . Undergone first ablation thyroid remnant high activity 131I ( ≥28 mCi ≥ 1.036 GBq ) . 5 . Undergone first 131I ablation T4 tumour use either Thyrogen ( 0.9 mg IM 2 consecutive day ) THW stimulation . This exclude use nonstandard Thyrogen regimen ( i.e. , regimen Thyrogen standard 0.9 mg IM 2 consecutive day receive Thyrogen combination THW ) . 6 . Historical record available confirm ablation result : DxWBS use small activity ( ≥2 mCi 74 MBq ) iodine 131I ( 123I ) perform least 6 month administration first ablation activity 131I and/or Stimulated Tg measure least 6 month administration first ablation activity 131I . Historical record patient meet follow criterion exclude retrospective evaluation : 1 . Received propylthiouracil , methimazole , vitamins supplement contain kelp iodine ( take multivitamin contain iodine kelp acceptable ) , medication significantly affect iodine handling high dose corticosteroid , high dose diuretic , lithium 45 day administration first ablative activity 131I . 2 . Received iodinecontaining contrast agent within 3 month prior first ablative activity 131I administer . 3 . Used amiodarone within 2 year prior first ablative activity 131I administer .</criteria>
