	<detailed_description>1 . PURPOSE The purpose study assess efficacy new model base iterative reconstruction algorithm noise reduction tool compare sensitivity finding enteric Crohn 's Disease sensitivity FBP ASIR CT Enterography finding enteric Crohn 's Disease . Definitions : Iterative reconstruction : A computer adapt mathematical calculation technique allow ability generate CT image less image noise ( picture degradation ) traditional image reconstruction technique . Reconstruction algorithm computer adapt mathematical calculation apply raw data image reconstruction . 2 . HYPOTHESIS The use different CT reconstruction algorithms allow quantitative assessment small bowel Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) expose patient low radiation dos . MBIR ASIR provide image low noise similarly accurate quantification CD . Additionally , MBIR allow acquisition CT data low radiation dos , comparable image quality quantitative assessment CD compare high radiation dose acquisition perform utilizing FBP ASIR . MBIR inferior FBP ASIR assess finding relate Crohn 's Disease CT enterography ( CTE ) . Definitions MBIR : Model Based Iterative Reconstruction algorithm FBP : Filtered Back Projection ASIR : Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction 3 . JUSTIFICATION Computed tomography image traditionally rely upon filter back projection ( FBP ) image reconstruction . This technique use relatively little compute power , require number assumption make data acquisition result increase image noise . The use iterative reconstruction technique recently start take place CT imaging . The major benefit iterative reconstruction technique ability generate CT image less image noise . This noise reduction allow tube current reduction IR image , limit radiation dose linear manner . Model base iterative reconstruction ( MBIR ) , replace old iterative technique , adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction ( ASIR ) . MBIR utilizes accurate model early research suggest MBIR image may reconstruct CT acquisition use significantly decrease radiation dose , similar image quality compare ASIR FBP . FBP , MBIR , ASIR post processing tool alter scan acquisition . Iterative reconstruction algorithm garner increased interest , especially elevate public concern radiation dose . MBIR techniques yet validate CT examination acquire evaluation Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . Clinical history , physical examination , laboratory investigation endoscopy use identify evaluate extent severity Crohn 's Disease along image study assist evaluation small bowel involvement CD . CT Enterography become preferred imaging modality assess small bowel involvement inflammatory bowel disease . The dose reduction property MBIR particularly appeal area CT image multiple scan may perform time assess progression relapse disease response treatment . Calprotectin protein find inside cytoplasm immune cell within intestine know neutrophil , granulocyte macrophage . Under condition mucosal inflammation see inflammatory bowel disease , calprotectin release lumen bowel excrete stool . Fecal Calprotectin level measure serve biological marker degree mucosal inflammation bowel . Fecal calprotectin level previously correlate degree mucosal inflammation see CT Enterography . 4 . OBJECTIVE To determine impact image quality , interpretability , Crohn 's Disease finding low dose compute tomography enterography ( CTE ) image acquire new model base iterative reconstruction algorithm compare standard image reconstruction . 5 . RESEARCH METHOD The research prospective non randomize study 163 consecutive patient clinically refer CT Enterography . 6 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Using sensitivity CTE calculate sample size , plan sample size study 163 subject . The study power 80 % demonstrate low radiation CTE ( ASIR MBIR ) non-inferior ( type I error rate 2.5 % , one side ) standard CTE . The sensitivity standard CTE assume 0.77 base pooled estimate [ 7 ] . 0.1 chosen non-inferiority margin . The correlation two procedure consider sample size calculation . We assume prevalence Crohn 's Disease 80 % among target population . Using nQuery statistical program , assumption proportion discordant examination 0.15 ( conditional probability positive find standard CTE 0.90 give positive finding ASIR MBIR CTE ) , sample size need detect 0.1 difference sensitivity two procedure patient disease 118 , 80 % power type I error 0.025 , one side . Assuming 80 % target population disease , approximately 148 subject need recruit . We factor 10 % drop rate ( patient leave study reason ) bringing total number patient recruit 163 . Image quality score quantitative analysis compare use standard novel reconstruction algorithm . These result also compare acquire FC level . Because patient examination receive multiple reconstruction , mixed-model analysis conduct account repeat observation within patient . Repeated measure analysis variance conduct separately outcome ( signal , noise , SNR , proportion interpretable segment , image quality ) type reconstruction use . A 0.05 significance level use repeat measure analysis . Primary Endpoint : FBP , ASIR MBIR compare reference standard describe . The endpoint ability method accurately identify presence absence Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) compare reference standard . Reference Standard : Dr. B. Bressler , principal investigator , gastroenterologist expertise inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Dr. Bressler review available clinical parameter include history physical exam finding , ileocolonoscopy finding available laboratory parameter include bloodwork Fecal Calprotectin level . The gastroenterologist blind subject 's identity . Based review parameter , rate presence small bowel CD definitely active , probably active , inactive ( remission ) absent .</detailed_description>
