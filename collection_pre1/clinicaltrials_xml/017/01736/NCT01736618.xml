	<brief_title>S-ICD® System Post Approval Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The S-ICD Post Approval Study non-randomized registry retrospectively enroll subject participate S-ICD Clinical Investigation ( IDE G090013 ) prospectively enroll new candidate S-ICD System . The target enrollment sample size 1,616 subject 150 investigational site achieve 1,025 subject analysis cohort 60 month . - The primary safety endpoint study Type I ( cause S-ICD System ) Complication Free Rate 60 month compare performance goal 85 % . - The primary effectiveness endpoint Overall Shock Effectiveness Converting Spontaneous Discrete Episodes ventricular tachycardia /ventricular fibrillation ( VT/VF ) 60 month compare performance goal 94 % . - The secondary safety endpoint study Electrode-Related Complication Free Rate 60 month compare performance goal 92.5 % . - The secondary effectiveness endpoint First Shock Effectiveness Converting Induced ( Acute ) Spontaneous Discrete Episodes VT/VF 60 month compare performance goal 84.0 % . Additional objective include characterization long term safety effectiveness subject vary body habitus traditionally underrepresented population . Subjects must meet follow criterion eligible inclusion study : 1 . Eligible implantation S-ICD System , OR previously implant S-ICD System S-ICD System Clinical Investigation ( IDE G090013 ) 2 .
