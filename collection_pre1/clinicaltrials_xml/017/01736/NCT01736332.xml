	<brief_summary>Background : - Some legal over-the-counter drug ( Vicks VapoInhaler ) food ( poppy seed ) may cause positive screen drug test . This might look like someone use illegal drug ( methamphetamine opiate ) . Researchers study body handle chemical may test like illegal drug long may detect body . Blood , saliva , urine sample collect . This study may help improve effectiveness accuracy drug test . Objectives : - To see body handle chemical may produce positive screening test additional test eliminate positive drug test over-the-counter drug food . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 65 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , laboratory test , ECG . - This study involve overnight stay secure research unit 2 day test . - On first day , participant take Vicks VapoInhaler ( two inhalation nostril ) every 2 hour 9 a.m. 7 p.m . They also take drink contain poppy seed twice ( 9 a.m. 5 p.m. ) . - On morning second day , participant take Vicks VapoInhaler . They discharge around 5 p.m. - On day , participant provide blood saliva sample several time throughout day . All urine collect 2 study day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Two widely available legal product , Vicks VapoInhaler ( lmethamphetamine trace amount d-methamphetamine ) poppy seed ( morphine codeine ) contain small amount psychoactive substance may generate positive test regulate drug conduct forensic , workplace drug abuse treatment setting . This study evaluate prevalence duration positive amphetamine opiates drug test blood , oral fluid ( OF ) urine . Study population : Up 30 healthy adult without history clinically significant adverse reaction nasal oral decongestant stimulant , oral opiate , poppy seed , buckwheat , hazelnut , sesame . Design : This open-label , non-treatment study participant spend two day NIDA IRP intervene night Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit ( BPRU ) . Vicks VapoInhaler ( 0.16-0.60 milligram l-methamphetamine trace amount d-methamphetamine ) administer intranasally every two hour six dos 9 7 pm first day seventh dose 6 second day . Food grade uncooked poppy seed ( 45 gram suspend 500 milliliter liquid ) administer orally 9 5 pm first day . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure prevalence positive test windows drug detection ( base concentration biological matrix ) methamphetamine , l-amphetamine , morphine , codeine blood , OF , urine . Secondary outcome measure 1 ) performance 2 OF collection device ( Quantisal Oral-Eze ) on-site OF screen test ( Draeger Drug Test 5000 ) comparison liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LCMSMS ) , performance urine screen test comparison gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) . Performance parameter prevalence positive test time point , windows drug detection , sensitivity , specificity l-methamphetamine , l-amphetamine , morphine , codeine OF urine . Cutoff concentration matrix specified Mandatory Guidelines Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs ; 2 ) detection d-methamphetamine blood , OF urine specimen ; 3 ) time course analytes blood comparison matrix , especially oral fluid/blood ratio . Significance : These data essential establish evidence-based drug policy legislation , establish oral fluid drug test Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration , answer current question whether use legal product could produce positive test federally mandate drug test program .</detailed_description>
