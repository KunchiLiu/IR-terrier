	<brief_title>Bortezomib Doxil Treatment Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) remain largely incurable despite advance make recent year increase complete response ( CR ) rate . In elderly patient ( age 60 ) , CR rate low , 40 50 % , long term disease-free overall survival le 10 % . The therapeutic option relapsed/refractory AML significantly limit . Bortezomib show promising activity patient advance hematologic malignancy , include leukemia non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Given available data suggest efficacy bortezomib combination doxil patient relapse multiple myeloma ( MM ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , Non Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) well know sensitivity AML anthracyclines vitro data demonstrate sensitivity multiply resistant AML cell bortezomib , propose use combination patient relapsed/refractory AML elderly patient candidate standard induction therapy . Using subcutaneous formulation bortezomib would provide patient reduced neurotoxicity easy schedule due decrease time infusion room would decrease overall cost care .</detailed_description>
