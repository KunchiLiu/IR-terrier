	<brief_summary>In cystic fibrosis , critical need good predictor treatment response . The investigator identify panel white blood cell biomarkers directly measure blood test subject cystic fibrosis . These biomarkers predict reduction airway inflammation infection accurately lung function testing , patient receive intravenous antibiotic therapy . In current study , hypothesize panel gene biomarkers readily measure peripheral blood sensitively predict change inflammation patient receive inhale antibiotic therapy , specifically Cayston ( inhale aztreonam lysine ) . Patients enrol study blood draw month inhale Cayston , order test whether gene predict response Cayston therapy robustly standard measure lung function test .</brief_summary>
