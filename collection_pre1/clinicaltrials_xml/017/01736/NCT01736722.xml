	<brief_summary>The Methodist Hospital Neurological Institute conduct clinical trial patient suffer Metastatic brain tumor . The objective study evaluate safety feasibility MRI-guided laser thermal therapy real-time MRI guidance treatment brain metastasis . Patient undergo laser therapy use MRI scan plan treatment ensure proper placement laser within tumor . The tumor heat laser monitor study physician real-time MRI see control temperature tissue . One place , thermal laser surgically remove lesion . After procedure , post treatment MR image thenbe acquire determination effective treatment region .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate feasibility safety MR-guided laser thermal ablation treatment-resistant brain tumor use Visualase® Thermal Therapy System ( Manufactured BioTex , Inc. , Houston , TX ) . The Visualase system FDA clear soft tissue ablation number surgical specialty include Neurosurgery ( see appendix documentation ) . Patients intracranial brain tumor measure 3 cm small large diameter fail conventional therapy ( surgery , stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain radiotherapy ) eligible . The target tissue contain tumor undergo MRI-guided laser induce thermal therapy . MR image use define treatment volume well plan verify placement applicator . The extent ablation quantitatively monitor displayed delivery use real-time , MR temperature image . MR temperature imaging also use monitor control temperature adjacent tissue . Treatment automatically stop MR temperature feedback system report temperature adjacent tissue rise preset threshold . Treatment manually stop neurosurgeon monitoring treatment real-time point procedure simply turn power laser Visualase® system console . After laser delivery , MR image use verify extent treatment plan therapy delivery necessary .</detailed_description>
