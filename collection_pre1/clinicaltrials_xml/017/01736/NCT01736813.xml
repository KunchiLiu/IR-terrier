	<brief_summary>The surface molecule CCR5 find tumor cell within liver metastasis colorectal cancer . Inhibition molecule lead reduction growth signal tumor cell subsequent slow halted tumor growth . The agent inhibition CCR5 already receive FDA approval treatment HIV show little side effect toxicity even long term treatment . Therefore CCR5-inhibition potential provide non-toxic tumor growth inhibition .</brief_summary>

Patients take immunomodulatory medication ( Type 1 interferon ) . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study treatment Patients single metastatic lesion ( intent resect metastasis ) Patients metastatic colorectal cancer drastic clinical progression ( e.g . Karnofsky performance 100 % 60 % ) within last six week screen participate The patient history autoimmune disease . The patient family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency .
