	<brief_title>Fetal Intervention Aortic Stenosis Evolving Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fetal aortic stenosis anatomically simple birth defect partial blockage aortic valve , limit blood flow leave side heart . If blockage become severe fetal life , leave heart structure may stop grow baby may bear hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( HLHS ) , lethal condition without neonatal heart surgery heart transplantation . Standard treatment baby bear HLHS include three major cardiac operation age 6 year . Postnatal outcomes HLHS uncertain vary patient ; however , adult survivor currently suffer substantial medical problem , include high incidence neurologic problem . For fetus severe obstruction , fetal intervention may improve outcome increase flow leave heart , thus improve left heart function encourage continued growth leave heart structure . If fetal intervention preserve leave heart function growth , provide good prognosis baby allow biventricular repair strategy birth . This research study prospective , non-randomized clinical trial 30 patient assess safety efficacy utero percutaneous balloon dilation fetal aortic valve severe stenosis . This technique successfully use perform postnatal aortic valve dilation several decade , limited application study utero . Pregnant woman carry fetus diagnose severe aortic stenosis refer University California , San Francisco Fetal Treatment Center evaluation , initial screen counseling . If fetal maternal inclusion criterion meet , balloon aortic valvuloplasty operation offer pregnant woman . Patients meet study eligibility decline prenatal intervention offer option enroll study control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant woman carry fetus normal cardiac segmental anatomy severe aortic stenosis define : Dysplastic/stenotic aortic valve forward flow , without gradient , significant insufficiency If mitral insufficiency ( incomplete closure mitral valve ) present , leave ventricle systolic pressure calculation must ≥ normal systemic blood pressure ( BP ) gestational age Retrograde aortic arch flow Left right atrial shunting Left ventricle length le 90 % length right ventricle Maternal age ≥ 16 year age ; Gestational age : 17 0/730 6/7 week ' gestation determine clinical information evaluation first ultrasound . ( Aortic valve dilation procedure perform 18 0/7 week ) ; Normal karyotype write confirmation result . Results fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) aneuploidy acceptable patient 24 week ; noninvasive testing acceptable ( maternal serum test cellfree fetal DNA , currently commercially available ) . Singleton pregnancy ; Able travel study site study evaluation , procedure , visit ; Support person travel stay patient ( support person require sign support person consent form ) ; Has receive preauthorization insurance fetal intervention ability selfpay study treatment Failure meet inclusion criterion ; Multifetal pregnancy ; Insulin dependent pregestational diabetes ; Fetal anomaly relate aortic stenosis . A detailed fetal anatomic ultrasound conduct consideration study find abnormal , patient exclude ; Current plan cerclage document history incompetent cervix ; Placenta previa placental abruption ; Short cervix ( &lt; 20mm ) measure cervical ultrasound ; Previous spontaneous delivery prior 37 week singleton pregnancy . If study candidate intact membrane induce , consider spontaneous . Stillbirths prior 37 week exclusionary . Obesity define body mass index 35 great ; Maternalfetal Rh isoimmunization , Kell sensitization history neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia ; Positive maternal HIV status . This due increase risk transmission fetus maternalfetal procedure . If patient 's HIV status unknown , patient must test found negative result enter fetal treatment group ; Known Hepatitis C positivity . If patient 's Hepatitis C status unknown , need screen ; Other maternal medical condition contraindication surgery general anesthesia , asthma , cardiac disease , refusal blood transfusion , previous hysterotomy active segment uterus ; Patient support person ( e.g. , husband , partner , mother ) , support person unwilling sign support person consent form ; Inability comply travel followup requirement study ; Patient meet psychosocial criterion handle implication study ; Participation another intervention study influence maternal fetal morbidity mortality ; Maternal hypertension would increase risk preeclampsia preterm delivery ( include , limited : uncontrolled hypertension , chronic hypertension end organ damage new onset hypertension current pregnancy ) .</criteria>
