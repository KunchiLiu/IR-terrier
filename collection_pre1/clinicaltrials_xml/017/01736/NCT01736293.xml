	<brief_summary>Background : - The ABCA4 gene contains blueprint ABCA4 protein . When protein absent faulty ( Stargardt disease ) , waste material dead cell collect eye . The waste material may cause cell eye die . This lead loss vision . Researchers want look blood skin sample people ABCA4 gene mutation study relate eye disease . Objectives : - To study eye disease related mutation ABCA4 gene . Eligibility : - Individuals least 12 year age ABCA4 gene mutation . Design : - The study require seven visit National Eye Institute clinic 5 year . In first year , three visit . After first year , participant one visit year 4 year . - Participants screen physical exam , full eye exam , medical history . The eye exam check eye pressure , light color sensitivity , retina function . - Participants provide blood sample skin tissue sample study . - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The objective study 1 ) establish cohort participant ABCA4-related retinopathy anticipation future clinical trial , 2 ) create repository plasma , DNA , skin fibroblast sample accrue cohort ABCA4-related retinopathy participant , 3 ) formulate clinical outcome measure future study , 4 ) acquire perform preliminary analysis data may advance understand genotype-phenotype correlation ABCA4-related retinopathy . In addition , skin fibroblast sample collect participant may use generate iPS cell , may differentiate RPE and/or neural retinal cell . These cell , produce , use analyze molecular mechanism involve disease pathogenesis perform high throughput ( HTP ) drug screen identify novel potential therapeutic compound . Study Population : Sixty-five ( 65 ) participant , age 12 , ABCA4-related retinopathy , include 20 participant cone-rod dystrophy initially accrue study . However , additional five participant may enrol replace participant may withdraw study prior reach Month 12 visit . Design : In natural history study , participant follow five year . Because three year may require enroll 65 participant , study last eight year . Participants recruit pre-existing NIH protocol , NEI Evaluation Treatment Trial ( 08-EI-0169 ) , NEI Screening Protocol ( 08-EI-0102 ) , National Ophthalmic Disease Genotyping Phenotyping Network , Phase II protocol ( eyeGENE II , 10-EI-N164 ) , referral outside clinician review pertinent medical record genetic testing . All participant undergo standardized medical/ophthalmic history complete baseline eye examination , include non-invasive electrophysiology ( e.g. , electroretinography ) , psychophysiology ( e.g. , microperimetry , static perimetry ) , diagnostic imaging examination ( e.g. , optical coherence tomography ) . The participant examine three time course first year ( i.e. , baseline examination , Month 6 , Month 12 ) . After first year , return NEI clinic annual basis next four year . This study require minimum seven study visit . Participants may see frequent interval investigator discretion , depend clinical research situation . Participants require submit blood sample part study DNA serum banking , option provide 3 mm punch skin biopsy facilitate research cellular level . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome study establishment cohort participant ABCA4-related retinopathy , secondary outcome creation repository plasma , DNA , skin fibroblast sample accrue cohort ABCA4-related retinopathy participant . Exploratory outcomes study include : 1 ) formulation clinical outcome measure future study 2 ) acquisition preliminary analysis data may advance understand genotype-phenotype correlation ABCA4-related retinopathy . Potential exploratory outcome include : 1 ) generation iPS cell skin fibroblast sample , 2 ) differentiation generate iPS cell RPE and/or neural retinal cell , 3 ) use participant-specific RPE and/or neural retinal cell perform HTP drug screen identify novel potential therapeutic compound . The cell obtain protocol may genetically modify may use vivo research .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>NCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participant must 12 year age old . 2 . Participant ( legal guardian ) must understand sign protocol inform consent document . 3 . Participant must able cooperate detail psychophysics electrophysiology test . 4 . Participant must able provide blood sample . 5 . Participant : A maculopathy retinal degeneration plus two ( ) clear mutation ABCA4 gene ( ascertain CLIAcertified test ) know associated retinal disease , OR One clear mutation ABCA4 associate classic presentation fundus flavimaculatus/Stargardt macular dystrophy ( e.g. , fleck , macular atrophy ) pathogenic mutation ( ) gene know cause macular dystrophy . OR One clear mutation ABCA4 , conerod degeneration clearly pathogenic mutation ( ) gene know cause conerod degeneration . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant evidence systemic condition ocular disease relate ABCA4 mutation would complicate analysis psychophysical , electrophysiological , image data . For example , participant advance diabetes mellitus significant diabetic retinopathy may display change retinal function could relate either his/her diabetic retinopathy ABCA4 mutation .</criteria>
