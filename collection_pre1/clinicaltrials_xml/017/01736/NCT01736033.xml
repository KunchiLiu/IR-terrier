	<brief_title>Advanced Benefits Alpha-blocker Monotherapy Lower Urinary Tracts Symptoms ( LUTS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though decided patient cautiously careful consideration prostate volume , Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) level , symptom score maximum uroflow , recently combination therapy alpha-blocker 5-alpha reductase inhibitor try imprudently Korea . As result several clinical trial conduct overseas releasing combination drug alpha-blocker 5-alpha reductase inhibitor , superiority combination therapy prove , however , plenty patient still n't derive additional profit . Therefore , study , investigator anticipate meet meaningful result clinical efficacy alpha-blocker monotherapy alpha-blocker + 5-alpha reductase inhibitor combination therapy Korean benign prostate hyperplasia patient , provide guideline combination therapy .</detailed_description>
