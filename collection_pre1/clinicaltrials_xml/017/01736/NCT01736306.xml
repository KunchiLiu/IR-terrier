	<brief_summary>Background : - At present , woman accurate test inform personal risk develop breast cancer . More information change associate benign cancerous breast lesion help develop good risk information . Researchers look cell find breast milk study genetic change relate breast cancer . However , cell sample collect white woman . A new study want collect breast milk sample African American woman research . Comparing result genetic test help improve understand breast cancer risk woman . Objectives : - To study genetic change relate breast lesion , include breast cancer , African American woman . Eligibility : - African American woman least 18 year age nursing baby either consider breast biopsy . Design : - Participants screen personal health question . - Participants receive box sterile bottle milk collection . They collect two breast milk sample , one breast . They also fill questionnaire medical history . - The box sample questionnaire return clinical center study . - After box return , participant ask provide copy biopsy report breast biopsy . - There followup phone call every year . Participants provide health history information . This information include whether diagnosed breast cancer previous year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increasing evidence support importance role pregnancy , lactation post-weaning breast remodel etiology certain type early onset aggressive breast cancer , include basal breast cancer , difficult detect treat disproportionately affect African American woman . Thus , improve method detect prevent early onset tumor important clinical , public health racial disparity perspective . Recent evidence indicate analysis breast milk postpartum period may advance discovery mechanism biomarkers relate risk early onset , aggressive tumor . However , develop method collect , process test milk biomarkers pose challenge . A research team co-led Drs . Mark Sherman ( NCI/DCEG/HREB ) Kathleen Arcaro ( University Massachusetts ) receive NIH Bench-to-Bedside award project entitle , Molecular Epidemiology Postpartum Involution Breast : Development Demonstration Tools Understanding Postpartum Period Relation Risk Early Onset Breast Cancer . The specific bench objective project include : 1 . To develop improved method fractionate breast milk epithelial cell rich liquid component 2 . To optimize assay DNA methylation , proliferation , apoptosis , p16 expression telomere length use epithelial enrich breast milk fraction , 3 . To develop assays TGF-beta ligand , prolactin sex -steroid hormone use liquid milk fraction . To achieve objective , NCI initially work fresh specimen prospectively collect University Massachusetts IRB-approved open protocol entitle Epigenetics Breast Cancer Risk African American Women , fund Avon Foundation Women . Dr. Arcaro lab study breast cancer risk promoter hypermethylation breast cell obtain milk nurse woman . They analyze breast cell nearly 400 woman continue long-term follow-up . However , majority data White woman . Since disease risk factor differ ethnic group , important test risk assessment method wide population . The main purpose specific UMass study extend finding breast cancer risk African American woman . They plan recruit 200 lactating African American woman participate breast milk study . This involve collect questionnaire data , complete methylation analysis eight gene , archive milk remain DNA future study , annual follow-up . The key aim seek address current protocol relate objective ( 1 ) list : To develop improved method fractionate breast milk epithelial cell rich liquid component . Given Dr. Arcaro IRB approve open protocol collect fresh milk University Massachusetts , NCI pursue collaborative aim ( effectively within timeframe bench-to-bedside award ) context ongoing study . Specifically , collaborative project subject IRB application ass follow aim vitro manipulation fresh liquid milk collection : 1 ) effect modify initial rinse epithelial pellet ( rinse solution : saline vs. medium ; centrifugation speed , temperature ) ; 2 ) yield cell nucleic acid achievable via fractionation milk use different type immunomagnetic bead ( coated antibody remove leukocyte ( negative selection ) vs. coat antibody remove epithelial cell ( positive selection ) ; 3 ) relative preservation room temperature 24 , 48 72 hour milk suspend cellular fixative ( e.g . formalin , Proclin ) compare fresh milk without fixation ; 4 ) possibility strategies 1 2 combine . This project bring together specific experience expertise University Massachusetts regard milk process technical knowledge NCI , provide Drs . Kopp , Heckman , Yang Sherman . In particular , NCI Frederick Dr. Heckman successfully use immunomagnetic bead technology purify epithelial cell blood product lactate mouse gland remove leukocyte .</detailed_description>
