	<brief_title>A Study Communication Genetic Test Results By Telephone : A Multi-Center Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basic science advance genomics provide great promise improve human health reduce burden cancer United States . The recent successes genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) relate technology identify genetic change associate variety common disease fuel rapidly grow field personalize medicine . The promise personalize medicine ability tailor treatment screen individual patient base genotype . Many highlight urgent need multidisciplinary translational research focus advance gene discovery effective clinical application . Genetic screening cancer susceptibility , one application personalize medicine , become standard evidence-based practice cancer prevention . Given complexity genetic information potential social psychological sequellae , two in-person visit ( e.g . pre-test post-test counseling ) genetic specialist recommend delivery genetic testing cancer susceptibility . With increase demand genetic service , two in-person visit delivery model present barrier widespread dissemination genetic test disease susceptibility . Innovative delivery model effective , efficient genetic risk communication result behavior change need . Telephone delivery genetic service one innovative efficient delivery model potential expand genetic service diverse clinical system address insufficient genetic workforce increase number genetic application enter clinical practice . While provider patient identify advantage telephone delivery genetic service , also recognize potential disadvantage particularly set positive test result . Thus , evaluation psychosocial behavioral impact innovation genetic service delivery ( i.e . telephone communication ) diverse population among vulnerable subgroup need optimize health benefit , minimize risk broad dissemination clinical genetic test cancer susceptibility . The goal research evaluate psychological , behavioral economic outcome ( i.e . risk benefit ) innovative efficient delivery model genetic service , telephone communication , compare current standard , in-person communication genetic test result . The investigator expect research inform evidence base practice guideline potentially change paradigm delivery genetic service disease susceptibility .</detailed_description>
