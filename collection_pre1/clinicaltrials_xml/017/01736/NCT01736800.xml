	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Chemotherapy With Temodar With Topotecan CNS Metastasis Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term objective research project develop chemotherapy-based approach treatment brain metastasis . The specific purpose study obtain data safety efficacy combination chemotherapy temozolomide topotecan patient central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases solid tumor . Patients brain metastasis solid tumor poor prognosis , despite improvement survival achieve modern neurosurgical radiation technique . Chemotherapy play significant role disease , may application salvage patient fail radiation therapy . In patient surgical candidate , require immediate XRT relieve symptom control systemic disease , effective chemotherapy alternative XRT might decrease risk radiation induce neurotoxicity . Recent advance treatment systemic disease use modern chemotherapy pathobiologic agent significantly improve overall survival cancer patient , put risk CNS metastases radiation induced neurotoxicity . Both , temozolomide topotecan good blood-brain barrier penetration show activity CNS malignancy . Preclinical study suggest synergy drug combination . This single-arm , open-label phase II drug study . All patient receive chemotherapy combination . Up 35 patient accrue 2-3 year follow 5 year . Patients receive 8 cycle chemotherapy . The primary endpoint rate radiologic response brain metastasis secondary endpoint median overall survival , progression-free survival , time progression brain metastasis toxicity . The study expect provide data use generate research hypothesis .</detailed_description>
