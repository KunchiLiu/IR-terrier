	<brief_title>Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) Adult Non-Neurofibromatosis Type 2 Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal MEEI Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) research study find new way improve hear patient deaf receive cochlear implant . The ABI surgically place bionic implant convert sound electrical signal directly transmit cochlear nucleus , first auditory center brain . For many year , ABIs improve hearing patient deaf due brain tumor associate genetic syndrome call Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) . However , number recent study suggest deaf patient NF2 eligible cochlear implant may also benefit placement ABI . These preliminary study suggest non-NF2 `` nontumor '' patient may actually better outcome ABI surgery patient suffer NF2 . Patients NF2 deaf due damage hear nerve inner ear infection , disease injury cochlear implant candidate option improve hear case except ABI . Thus , purpose study carefully analyze whether ABI surgery improve hear quality life non-NF2 patient base subjective objective measure hear ABI surgery . In particular , plan study ABI outcomes non-NF2 patient , characterize parameter use device , determine safety profile ABIs patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 year age old English primary language Medically psychologically suitable Willing receive/have receive meningitis / pneumococcal vaccination Able comply study requirement , include travel investigational site Cochlear retrocochlear anomaly/pathology interferes transmission auditory information cochlea brainstem , result severe profound bilateral deafness ( threshold 90 dB bad ear pure tone audiometry range 250 2,000 Hz speech recognition score ≤ 30 % ear ) . All subject undergo bone conduction audiometry tympanometry confirm sensorineural hearing loss rule potential middle ear disorder . Conditions otherwise treat , conventional hearing aid cochlear implant . If CI previously use , subject fail response , define ≤ 30 % speech recognition patient perception inadequate benefit continue use device . Expected subject include diagnosis : Bilaterally severe/completely ossify cochleae Bilateral cochlear malformation lead poor CI outcomes Bilateral temporal bone fracture , VIIIth cranial nerve disrupt Bilateral cochlear nerve agenesis Not CI candidate base listed pathology , intolerable adverse effect CI ( e.g . stimulation facial nerve ) , Evoked Auditory Potential test predictive poor response Anomalies/pathology involve brainstem cortex Retrocochlear pathology due NF2 type cranial nerve brainstem neoplasm Coexisting medical condition require irradiation brainstem auditory cortex Medical psychological condition serve contraindication surgery Additional handicap would prevent limit participation evaluation Unrealistic patient family expectation regard benefit , risk , limitation inherent procedure prosthetic device Pregnant woman</criteria>
