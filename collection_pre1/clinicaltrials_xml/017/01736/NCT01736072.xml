	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two different surgical procedure treatment Rectal Cancer : Laparoscopic Surgery Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery . The ROLARR study participant cancer rectum laparoscopic operation ( sometimes call `` keyhole surgery '' ) recommend surgeon . In past rectal cancer remove use `` open '' surgery . Open surgery involve large cut middle patient 's abdomen allow surgeon see take cancer . On previous study show use laparoscopic surgery remove colorectal cancer good open surgery cure cancer . There another option remove rectal cancer , involve use robotic system laparoscopic surgery . This type surgery call `` robotic-assisted '' laparoscopic surgery become widely use surgeon remove cancer include rectum , well non-cancer operation . In order perform robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery , surgeon sits robotic control unit foot away patient . Using robotic control unit , surgeon see clear video image patient 's abdomen operation site . The surgeon perform operation robotic control unit control movement set robotic surgical instrument , guide video camera . Like standard laparoscopic surgery , surgeon able carry entire operation small cut abdomen . The camera robotic system provide 3D high-definition magnified view operation site robotic system also able translate movement surgeon 's hand small precise movement inside patient 's body . We want test whether robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery good , even well , remove rectal cancer standard laparoscopic surgery ( actually Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery use standard care rectal cancer patient University California , Irvine Medical Center ) . We also want investigate whether use robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery reduce number time laparoscopic operation need convert open operation , see whether use robotic system also shorten length time patient need stay hospital reduces number complication patient may operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The feasibility safety laparoscopic surgery establish colon cancer . The case rectal cancer less clear , report multicentre trial Medical Research Council ( MRC ) CLASICC trial include evaluation laparoscopic compare open rectal cancer surgery . Although laparoscopic open rectal cancer resection associate similar lymph node yield , concern express high rate circumferential resection margin ( CRM ) involvement laparoscopic arm ( 12.4 % ) compare open arm ( 6.3 % ) patient undergo anterior resection . This however translate difference local recurrence either 3-year 5-year follow-up . The difference CRM involvement felt reflect increase technical difficulty associate laparoscopic technique rectal cancer subgroup . This support high conversion rate laparoscopic rectal subgroup ( 34 % ) compare laparoscopic colon subgroup ( 25 % ) . Analysis CLASICC data reveal high morbidity mortality rate associate laparoscopic case convert open operation ( 30-day morbidity : laparoscopic 29 % , convert 45 % ; in-hospital mortality : laparoscopic 1 % , convert 9 % ) . Some increase morbidity may relate advanced cancer require conversion , proportion inevitably result increased operative time , increase technical difficulty , need laparotomy wound convert case . The introduction robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery use da Vinci™ system ( Intuitive Surgical , California , USA ) promise eliminate many technical difficulty inherent laparoscopic surgery . It offer advantage intuitive manipulation laparoscopic instrument 7-degrees freedom movement , 3-dimensional field view , stable camera platform zoom magnification , dexterity enhancement , ergonomic operating environment . Experience show benefit robot appreciated surgical accuracy require within confined space , pelvis . Laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery technically demand require accurate pelvic dissection accord total mesorectal excision ( TME ) principles autonomic nerve preservation . Inadvertent injury nerve attribute high rate male sexual dysfunction follow laparoscopic surgery . The practicality robotic-assisted colorectal cancer surgery report small series two study concentrate rectal cancer , one perform randomised comparison small number patient . The literature robotic-assisted colon surgery limit 17 small case series . Most comprise mixed benign malignant disease . The large D'Annibale et al report 53 robotic-assisted colectomies compare outcomes 53 laparoscopic resection . It conclude robotic-assisted surgery safe effective laparoscopic , particularly useful pelvic dissection , cost-effectiveness need evaluation . Other report concur robotic-assisted colorectal surgery feasible safe , low rate conversion , morbidity mortality , increase operative time . There one study address issue hospital cost . This compare 30 robotic-assisted 27 standard laparoscopic case conclude total hospital cost high robotic surgery . The feasibility robotics TME rectal cancer resection establish Pigazzi et al series 6 low rectal cancer . A subsequent follow-up study 39 rectal cancer treat prospectively robotic-assisted resection report zero rate conversion mortality 0 % morbidity 12.8 % . The randomised trial compare 18 patient assign robotic-assisted resection 18 patient assigned standard laparoscopic resection . No difference observe operative time , conversion rate ( 2 laparoscopic , 0 robotic ) , quality mesorectal resection . The difference length hospital stay , significantly short follow robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery ( robotic-assisted : 6.9 +/-1.3 day ; standard laparoscopic : 8.7 +/-1.3 day , p &lt; 0.001 ) attribute reduction surgical trauma author . In addition original report , one systematic review robotic-assisted colorectal surgery , conclude `` robotic colorectal surgery promise field may provide powerful additional tool optimal management challenge pathology , include rectal cancer '' . The current proposal aim test hypothesis robotic-assistance facilitates laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery . On short-term follow-up result reduction conversion rate worsen CRM positivity rate . On longer-term follow-up , increased accuracy improve post-operative bladder sexual function , enhance quality life ( QoL ) , ensure increase local disease recurrence . There grow enthusiasm robotics many surgical speciality . This enthusiasm often support data clinical cost-effectiveness derive rigorous evaluation randomise controlled trial . This case robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery . Given expense associate robotic system limit evidence support clinical economic benefit , essential proper assessment new technology perform timely manner widespread recommendation implementation . A randomized trial robotic-assisted versus standard laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery urgently need . Rationale current study The safety efficacy robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery establish certain operation , notably radical prostatectomy . Pelvic surgery , include rectal cancer surgery , lend robotic-assistance . However , experience robotic- assisted rectal cancer surgery limit small personal series one randomise clinical trial . Although data suggests feasible , establish benefit standard laparoscopic surgery term technical , functional oncological outcome . The primary aim curative cancer surgery complete oncological resection tumor minimal morbidity . It therefore utmost importance prior widespread use robotics rectal cancer surgery , subject rigorous evaluation . The use new technology incurs additional financial burden already overstretch health care resource therefore essential ass health economics cost- effectiveness comparison alternative treatment . As trial unlikely repeat , 3-year outcome cost effectiveness include within trial . Specifically , aim provide information ability robotic system facilitate laparoscopic rectal cancer resection , impact oncological outcome ( short-term long-term ) , effect functional outcome QoL , cost-effectiveness term future healthcare decision-making . Currently , foreseeable future , one surgical robotic system , da Vinci™ robot . To avoid criticism commercial bias , imperative evaluation robotic technology perform independently manufacturer . Justification randomize control trial Since new technology , essential proper evaluation perform disseminated prior widespread implementation . A timely assessment imperative reason plan perform prior pilot study , would inevitably delay evaluation proper scientific method . The feasibility robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery already establish preliminary data upon base sample size calculation available . The time right formal randomise control trial provide definitive answer propose research question . Aims Objectives The purpose trial perform rigorous evaluation robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery mean randomise , control trial . The chosen comparator standard laparoscopic rectal cancer resection , essentially procedure without use robotic device . The two operative intervention evaluate short- longer-term outcome . The key short-term outcome include assessment technical ease operation , determine clinical indicator low conversion rate open operation , clear pathological resection margin indicator surgical accuracy improve oncological outcome . In addition , QoL assessment analysis cost- effectiveness perform aid evidence-based knowledge inform National Health Service ( NHS ) service provider decision-makers . These short-term outcome analyze last randomised patient 6 month follow-up provide timely assessment new technology , make available public , clinician healthcare provider inform health-care decision making . Longer-term outcome concentrate oncological aspect disease surgical treatment analysis disease-free overall survival local recurrence rate 3-year follow-up .</detailed_description>
