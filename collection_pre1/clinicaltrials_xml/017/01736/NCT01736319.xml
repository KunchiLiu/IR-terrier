	<brief_summary>Background : - Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) first-line treatment malaria . ACTs highly effective , malaria cause Plasmodium falciparum parasite become resistant ACTs . ACT-resistant malaria show part Cambodia , yet part country . This show treating patient ACTs , check amount parasite patient blood every 6 hour , calculate rate parasite clearance . The parasite clearance rate response ACTs get slow western Cambodia may first sign ACT resistance . Researchers want study effective ACTs different region Cambodia . This study look extent ACT resistance widespread ACT-resistant malaria become . Objectives : - To compare prevalence ACT-resistant malaria western , northern eastern Cambodia . Eligibility : - Individuals 2 65 year age uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria take antimalarial drug symptoms previous 7 day . Design : - Participants recruit clinic hospital three Cambodian province . - Participants inform study consent participate study obtain . - A venous blood sample obtain patient treatment use laboratory experiment measure parasite patient factor might affect parasite clearance rate . - Participants malaria treat dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PPQ ) , standard first-line treatment malaria Cambodia . - Treatment monitor frequent blood sample obtain finger prick . The amount malaria parasites blood sample count follow longer detectable . - Participants weekly follow-up visit 9 week . Finger-prick blood sample take visit see parasites reappear treatment ACT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) first-line treatment Plasmodium falciparum malaria worldwide . In Western Cambodia , artemisinin resistance define long half-life parasite clearance ( T1/2 ) response artemisinin , give orally uncomplicated malaria . We hypothesize artemisinin resistance phenotype compromise efficacy ACTs . The primary objective study compare P. falciparum recrudescence rate Western , Northern Eastern Cambodia , follow dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PPQ ) treatment . The secondary objective study determine whether parasite recrudescence associate long T1/2 . In Parasite Recrudescence Study , patient uncomplicated malaria receive directly-observed treatment DHA-PPQ 3 day . We follow patient weekly 9 week identify recurrent parasitemia use genotyping method distinguish recrudescence reinfections . We enroll subset patient initial parasite density great equal 10,000/microL Parasite Clearance Rate Study follow parasite density intensively examine 6-hourly finger prick blood sample parasites undetectable microscopy . With data calculate compare T1/2 value patient without recrudescent parasitemia . Using various laboratory assay , also explore contribution host factor T1/2 variation , whether naturally-acquired immunity reduces risk drug-resistant parasite recrudescence .</detailed_description>
