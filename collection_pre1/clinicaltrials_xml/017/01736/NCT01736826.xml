	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate plasma concentration nucleosomes free DNA differ three group : 1. pregnant patient complication typical placental insufficiency venous thrombosis ( group P ) , 2. healthy woman ( Group T1 ) 3. healthy pregnant woman ( Group T2 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Free DNA Nucleosome Concentrations Pathological Pregnancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our secondary objective include follow : 1 . To describe , 15 healthy , non-pregnant woman change plasma concentration nucleosomes free DNA 3 month . 2 . To describe , 15 pregnant woman ( without complication ) , change plasma concentration nucleosomes free DNA last 7 month pregnancy 3 . To show plasma concentration nucleosomes free DNA , patient complicate pregnancy differ accord nature complication 4 . To show relationship exist concentration nucleosomes , free DNA , total granulocyte microparticles ( trophoblast particle pregnant woman ) 5 . To evaluate relationship nucleosome concentration , free DNA concentration circulate leukocyte population 6 . To evaluate relationship nucleosome concentration , free DNA concentration hemostasis marker 7 . To describe change hemostasis marker throughout pregnancy 8 . To evaluate relationship nucleosome concentration , free DNA concentration angiogenic marker CD146 9 . To add Nîmes University Hospital biological collection .</detailed_description>
