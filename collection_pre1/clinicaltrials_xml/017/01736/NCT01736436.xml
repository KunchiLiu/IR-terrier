	<brief_summary>It show preclinical experiment bone marrow patient myelodysplastic syndrome APG101 rescue erythrocytes premature cell death . This expected translate improve erythropoiesis ameliorate anemia MDS patient . APG101 might , therefore , valuable addition current treatment low- intermediate MDS patient suffer anaemia . Transfusion-dependent patient low intermediate risk MDS accord WHO Prognostic Scoring Scale ( WPSS ) include study . Treatment consist 100mg APG101 intravenous weekly treatment 12 week + 6 month follow phase . Primary objective trial safety tolerability APG101 ; secondary objective - Hematologic , cytologic cytogenetic response rate use modify International Working Group ( IWG ) response criterion - Incidence time leukemic progression 37 week - OS ( Overall survival ) 37 week</brief_summary>
