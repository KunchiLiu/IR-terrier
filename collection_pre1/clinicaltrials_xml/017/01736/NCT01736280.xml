	<brief_title>Evaluating Treating Potential Research Participants With Digestive Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Institute Nursing Research ( NINR ) conduct protocol evaluate provide standard treatment participant various diagnose undiagnosed digestive condition . Investigators protocol provide GI consultation NIH Clinical Center range GI condition . Objectives : The primary objective protocol allow digestive care specialist NINR institution provide standard care . Evaluating treat participant allow digestive care specialist maintain expertise gain additional knowledge course various digestive disorder . Additionally protocol allow hypothesis generation provide resource patient enrollment new research protocol throughout NINR branch . The information obtain allow evaluation standard treatment study digestive disease . This understanding may lead idea future protocol . The protocol also allow trainee receive train management digestive disorder . Study Population : The number participant evaluation treatment protocol set 500 patient digestive disorder unaffected first-degree relative . Design : This natural history evaluation treatment protocol progression physiology multiple digestive disorder . Blood biologic sample ( include limited stool , urine , saliva , hair , cheek swab , tissue ) obtain non-invasive mean incidentally clinical care future laboratory study . In addition , genetic sample may collect unaffected first-degree relative may use identify verify causative mutation . Outcome Measures : The outcome measure protocol clinical assessment enrol participant , include response standard treatment . Also , causative mutation may help establish pathogenic mechanism genotype-phenotype correlation .</detailed_description>
