	<brief_title>A Pilot Project Exploring Impact Whole Genome Sequencing Healthcare</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) whole exome sequencing ( WES ) service currently available utilized physician patient research clinical setting . The widespread availability use WGS WES practice clinical medicine imminent . In near future , sequence individual genome inexpensive ubiquitous , patient look medical establishment interpretation , insight advice improve health . Developing standard procedure use WGS information clinical medicine urgent need , numerous obstacle relate integrity storage WGS data , interpretation responsible clinical integration . MedSeq™ seek develop process integrate WGS clinical medicine explore impact . We believe WGS use many way , include two distinct complementary situation . In generally healthy patient , physician use result WGS derive insight future health risk inform prevention surveillance effort , category refer General Genomic Medicine . In patient present family history symptom disease , physician use result WGS interrogate particular set gene know associated disease question , category refer Disease-Specific Genomic Medicine . Beginning fall 2012 , enroll 10 primary care physicians 100 healthy middle-aged patient evaluate use General Genomic Medicine , 10 cardiologist 100 patient present hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) evaluate use Disease-Specific Genomic Medicine . We randomize physician patient within model receive clinically meaningful information derive WGS versus current standard care without use WGS . MedSeq™ comprise three distinct highly collaborative project . Project 1 enroll physician patient protocol , educate physician basic genomic principle safely monitor use genomic information clinical practice . Project 2 use WGS analysis/interpretation pipeline generate genome report patient randomize receive WGS protocol . Project 3 examine preference motivation physician patient enrol , evaluate flow utilization genomic information within clinical interaction , ass understanding , behavior , medical consequence healthcare cost associate use WGS model medical practice . In extension phase study , 1 ) recruit approximately 10-15 patient-participants self-identify African African American , whose physician deem healthy . All place whole genome-sequencing arm study . They undergo activity traditional MedSeq participant except randomization . 2 ) We conduct target phenotype assessment MedSeq Project patient-participants identify monogenic finding . We plan perform additional analysis review medical record look specifically variant mind see feature associate variant know prior study identify test physical course study . This initiative significantly accelerate use genomics clinical medicine create safely test novel method integrate information WGS physicians ' care patient .</detailed_description>
