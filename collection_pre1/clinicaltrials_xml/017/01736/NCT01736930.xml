	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate overnight system turn insulin pump automatically system predict low blood sugar likely . The study system include combination continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) / insulin pump make Medtronic MiniMed , Inc regular laptop computer run computer program predicts low blood sugar . It work ( 1 ) measure glucose level skin continuous glucose monitor , ( 2 ) use computer program laptop predict happen glucose level next 35-55 minute , ( 3 ) turn insulin pump computer program predicts low blood sugar occur . We test system overnight hospital ready test system home environment learn well work make sure blood sugar go high pump shuts . This study several phase take month little patient complete . Patients use study system 5 day home show patient able use correctly . After , patient ask use study system night additional 3-4 week . During time , system active two-thirds night active one-third night . When system active predicts blood sugar become low , insulin pump shut 2 hour . The study include 2 clinical center United States .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Outpatient Pump Shutoff Pilot Feasibility Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meet eligibility criterion use study system overnight home 5 night demonstrate ability use system submit study data Coordinating Center . Patients successfully demonstrate ability use system describe eligible randomized trial phase . This phase consist use full system outpatient approximately 21 night : - Each night blood glucose level check study blood glucose ( BG ) meter use perform calibration CGM . The calibration must occur 90 minute prior activation system . NOTE : Patients instructed calibrate CGM per manufacturer guideline . - Then system activate , link CGM insulin pump computer bedside . - A randomization schedule laptop use determine whether 'pump shut ' application active night . - Patients blind whether pump shut active session initiate night . - There alarm pump shuts . The CGM alarm set 60 mg/dL . When CGM alarm occurs , patient ask measure blood glucose BG meter , he/she aware alarm . - The time period outcome assessment night time system activate turned morning . - Pump shut , occur , 2 hour . Multiple instance pump suspension occur recurrent prediction hypoglycemia night . - Patients ask check blood glucose study BG meter , blood ketone study ketone meter , urine ketone ketone strip morning prior breakfast enter result study laptop . The patient instruct contact study physician blood glucose ketone reading expect range . Patients contact morning safety value report required range . - Patients ask record overnight carbohydrate intake study laptop . - Patients ask perform periodic data uploads use study laptop . Monitoring process ensure patient contact uploads occur require , review upload reveals extreme , prolong episode low high blood glucose reading , elevate morning blood glucose , blood ketone , urine ketone value . Upon completion study , patient well study clinician ask complete questionnaire regard use study system . There follow-up visit completion 21 successful night study system use . A successful night study system use define use system least four hour . Phone contact patient make week .</detailed_description>
