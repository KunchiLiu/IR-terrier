	<detailed_description>Research provide support efficacy cognitive-behavioral family intervention adolescent substance use disorder ( SUD ) , HIV-risk behavior , relate problem . Despite support intervention , substantial heterogeneity treatment outcomes high relapse rate consistently find across study . Such variability highlight need innovative strategy broaden impact strengthen durability effect adolescent substance abuse treatment . Over past two decade , research demonstrate positive effect contingency management ( CM ) method reduction substance use problem behavior HIV-risk , primarily adult . CM show improve outcome combine evidence-based practice research emerge suggest integration may also effective adolescent substance abuser . The propose Stage II efficacy trial examines integration CM two empirically-supported intervention : group MET/CBT FFT . By compare two intervention modality ( group vs. family , study provide unique opportunity examine robustness effect CM across establish adolescent treatment , compare change mechanism may account treatment outcomes . In proposed research , substance abuse adolescent ( n = 160 ) randomly assign either FFT group MET/CBT . Random assignment also use determine whether youth receive CM condition provide incentive abstinence ( i.e. , clean urine screen ) treatment participation . Thus , participant receive one four intervention condition , two integrated CM intervention ( MET/CBT-CM , FFT-CM ) two without CM ( MET/CBT , FFT ) . The study employ 2 ( Incentives : CM , nonCM ) x 2 ( Modality : MET/CBT , FFT ) x 5 ( Time : Baseline , 2- , 4- , 8- , 12-months post-randomization ) factorial design . The primary aim study examine efficacy integrate CM intervention two evidence-based treatment adolescent , MET/CBT FFT , compare treatment without CM drug abuse abstinence ( ) treatment ( i.e. , speed effect ) ( b ) post-treatment follow-up assessment ( i.e. , durability effect ) . A second aim study evaluate effect CM hypothesize mediator intervention effect MET/CBT FFT condition . The investigator anticipate CM condition , compare nonCM condition , likely accelerate adolescent 's motivation ( 1 ) achieve abstinence , attend participate treatment , complete homework assignment . Exploratory analysis examine difference modality ( MET/CBT v FFT ) presume mediator . The investigator expect MET/CBT produce great improvement adolescent ' drug avoidance self-efficacy FFT produce great improvement family relationship . The investigator also examine effect intervention HIV-risk behavior expect CM demonstrate large reduction HIV-risk behavior compare nonCM condition . The study address question whether add Contingency Management ( CM ) approach , adolescent provide monetary incentive provide clean urine , enhance efficacy two research-proven intervention adolescent substance use . Specifically , investigator compare Functional Family Therapy ( FFT ) Motivational Enhancement/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( MET/CBT ) combine CM well either intervention alone . The investigator also explore extent addition CM increase speed adolescent achieve abstinence well durability effect time . The inclusion two distinct form therapy also permit investigation intervention achieve effect adolescent drug use ( e.g. , improvement family function FFT vs. improvement drug avoidance self-efficacy skill MET/CBT ) . Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate efficacy CM versus nonCM condition deliver context either group ( MET/CBT ) family ( FFT ) treatment substance abuse adolescent . The investigator use two substance use dependent variable . The first variable ass presence absence illegal substance urine sample collect weekly begin baseline continue 12-14 week schedule treatment . Urine sample collect post-randomization assessment . Although adolescent polydrug user , marijuana primary drug abuse . The investigator anticipate weekly urine screen able detect recent marijuana use . The Time Line Follow-back ( TLFB ) use provide weekly estimate drug use abstinence period 3 month 12 month randomization . Specifically , investigator predict CM versus nonCM condition produce significant main effect increase number week drug use abstinence treatment phase ( i.e. , month 1-4 ; Hypothesis 1a ) post treatment period ( i.e. , 4-12 month ; Hypothesis 1b ) . Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate efficacy CM versus nonCM secondary behavioral outcome . Specifically , The investigator predict CM versus nonCM condition associate significantly low level sexually risky behavior ( Hypothesis 2a ) conduct problem ( Hypothesis 2b ) time . Specific Aim 3 : To evaluate effect CM hypothesize mediator MET/CBT FFT intervention effect . The investigator anticipate CM condition likely nonCM condition accelerate adolescent 's motivation ( 1 ) achieve abstinence , ( 2 ) attend participate treatment , ( 3 ) complete homework assignment . The SOCRATES scale ass motivation achieve abstinence . Specifically , investigator predict youth receive CM versus nonCM show high rate motivation change 2-month assessment ( Hypothesis 3a ) high rate treatment attendance homework compliance ( measured weekly therapist report ) course treatment ( Hypothesis 3b ) . Exploratory Aims : The investigator conduct exploratory analysis examine number continuous week abstinence treatment , adolescent 's motivation achieve abstinence , attendance , homework compliance mediate abstinence follow treatment . Additional analysis examine difference modality ( MET/CBT v FFT ) presume mediator : MET/CBT produce great improvement adolescent 's drug avoidance self-efficacy FFT produce great improvement family relationship ( measure FES ) . Improvements drug avoidance self-efficacy family relationship mediate improvement MET/CBT FFT , respectively . The investigator also explore potential difference within modality determine add CM enhances effect modality impact presumed mediator outcome . The result analyse help determine sufficient merit warrant additional research mechanism action within modality . Finally , investigator conduct informal cost-effectiveness analysis derive preliminary estimate relative cost treatment modality , particularly respect treatment engagement/attendance youth outplacement restrict setting .</detailed_description>
