	<brief_summary>A 10 minute baseline survey administer parent healthy newborn infant hospital delivery Brigham Women 's Hospital , follow 25 minute survey 3-24 month later . We measure parent ' attitude preference related genome screening newborn . The specific aim study : 1 . To investigate whether parent ' opinion regard genome screening newborn change first 48 hour post-partum 3-24 month post-partum . . We hypothesize significant difference interest genome screen result 48 hour post-partum compare 3-24 month post-partum . 2 . To determine whether see hypothetical genome screen result affect parent ' decision regard whether would want genome screen newborn . 1 . We expect many parent state initially ( 48 hour post-partum ) would elect genome screen newborn available . In follow-up survey , half study participant receive hypothetical scenario need struggle probabilistic ambiguous nature information could derive genome sequencing . We examine whether alters preference . We also explore whether parent receive hypothetical genome screen result scenario likely alter preference parent receive hypothetical scenario .</brief_summary>
