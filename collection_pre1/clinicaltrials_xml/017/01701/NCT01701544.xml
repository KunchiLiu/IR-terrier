	<brief_summary>We perform pilot study evaluate effectiveness human NBM DBS improve cognitive deficit PD patient refer eligible conventional DBS treatment coexist motor impairment . Six patient PD motor fluctuation cognitive impairment ( include restrict deficit attention work memory ) bilateral electrode implanted ensure superficial contact lie conventional motor GPi target , deep electrical contact lie NBM- ( see figure 1 ) . We place electrode use conventional image guide , stereotactic frame-based procedure currently use patient NHNN . Patients randomise 2 group crossover trial design 3 month period NBM stimulation switch switch separated 1 month washout period , follow patient cross opposite condition 3 months- see timeline . At end crossover period , patient invite continued follow stimulation switch neuropsychological evaluation 6 monthly interval . Patients give option receive additional conventional stimulation motor GPi , high contact electrode , end crossover period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patient meet Queen Square brain bank criterion diagnosis PD motor fluctuation ( period and/or Ldopa induce dyskinesia ) response medication know improve GPi DBS , appropriate candidate GPi DBS aside coexistence cognitive impairment . Patients age 35 80 year . Patients able give inform consent . Patients meet criterion PD dementia . Patients MMSE score 26 low cutoff 21 restrict sample mild dementia cognitive impairment . This equivalent age education adjust scale score great 5 low 9 ( mildly impaired range ) Mattis Dementia Rating Scale2 . Patients minimal atrophy preoperative brain MRI scan . Patients live home carer live e.g . spouse Able comply trial protocol willing attend clinic necessary visit Diagnosis suspicion cause parkinsonism dementia . Known abnormality CT MRI brain imaging consider likely compromise compliance trial protocol . Prior intracerebral surgical intervention Parkinson 's disease include Deep Brain stimulation , lesional surgery , growth factor administration , gene therapy cell transplant .</criteria>
