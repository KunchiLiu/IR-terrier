	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) common neurological disorder cause disability young adult affect approximately 1 1.000 people western country . The clinical manifestation usually begin age 20 40 year median age 28 year onset acute episode neurological dysfunction , follow period partial complete remission clinical stability relapse . This relapsing-remitting phase ( RR-MS ) disease usually follow progressive clinical disability ( secondary progressive phase , SP-MS ) . At present , cure MS. Based pathological concept neuroinflammation common element lead contribute neurodegenerative change , immune intervention introduce clinical practice Natalizumab ( Tysabri ) , humanize monoclonal antibody . Natalizumab ( Tysabri ) indicate disease-modifying monotherapy highly active relapse MS . The associated risk , especially progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy , necessitate active monitoring patient continuous discussion optimum use drug . In clinical practice , question manage patient natalizumab high risk progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy remain unresolved . This prospective , control ( comparison period prior natalizumab treatment ) , single-arm , open-label , multi-centre , phase IV study aim evaluate concept natalizumab de-escalation interferon-beta-1b e.o.d relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patient , consider stop natalizumab due benefit-risk assessment . In particular , evaluate interferon beta-1b treatment may able overcome recurrence significant clinical radiological disease activity natalizumab cessation may keep disease activity well control compare time prior natalizumab . The study population include patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RR-MS ) treat least 12 month natalizumab decide stop natalizumab treatment de-escalate therapy first line treatment interferon beta-1b . They treat 12 month interferon-beta 1b 250 mcg give subcutaneously every day . A 12-month follow-up period treatment plan .</brief_summary>
