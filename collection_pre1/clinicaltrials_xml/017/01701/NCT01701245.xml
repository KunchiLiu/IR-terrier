	<brief_summary>Subjects enrol 10 week study first two week document number cluster headache mean treat ( medication ) attack . Subjects randomize either two group . The first group continue standard care second group treatment investigational device ( GammaCore ) period 4 week . After 4 week period , subject treat GammaCore another 4 week period . It hypothesize treatment group reduction mean cluster headache per week 50 % compare standard care group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Acute Treatment Chronic Cluster Headache Compared Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective randomize control multi-center investigation design comparison two parallel group , GammaCore® ( active treatment ) Standard Care , SoC , ( control ) . The study period begin 2 week run-in period , follow 4 week comparative period subject randomize either active treatment control 1:1 . The comparative period follow period subject receive GammaCore® 4 weeks.After subject sign Consent Form participation baseline ( visit1 ) data collect . Subject inform complete 2 week diary run-in period During run-in period , subject use stable SoC accord individual prescription . The subject record CH attack regard duration frequency use medication oxygen . Once subject finalized run-in period , randomize continue 4 week comparative period . During period , control group continue stable SoC active group provide GammaCore® device prophylactic acute treatment addition stable SoC Subjects stimulate 3 x 2 time daily part prophylactic treatment regimen ( cervical vagal nerve ) . Three 90 second stimulation self-administered subject 5 minute stimulation right side neck . This preventive stimulation regimen perform : - First Daily Treatment - within 1 hour wake - Second Daily Treatment - 7-10 hour follow first daily treatment Acute CH attack : - 3 x 90 second treatment consecutively onset pain symptom . If attack abort within 15 minute subject informed take SOC abortive medication . - If acute cluster headache attack treat GammaCore® device , subject try work within preventive treatment window avoid preventive treatment 2-hour refractory period follow acute treatment . A total minimally 6 stimulation preventive part need acute attack . The active group also continue stable SoC entire 4 week period . Both group record CH attack diary together medication oxygen use . All adverse event shall also record diary . The end 4 week comparative period mark completion randomize part study , however subject provide option continue 4 week GammaCore® treatment stimulation parameter 4 week randomization period . All subject randomize SoC group receive training . During entire study period , subject allow take rescue medication include oxygen inhalation abortion CH attack . The amount dose medication oxygen record diary .</detailed_description>
