	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate benefit switch away efavirenz ( patient take combination Kivexa速 part combination pill , Atripla速 ) patient central nervous system side effect ( insomnia { difficulty sleep } , bad dream etc ) . The investigator study investigate effect switch single tablet regimen ( Eviplera速 ) contain tenofovir , emtricitabine rilpivirine . If patient currently take Atripla , rilpivirine new component combination . Rilpivirine drug HIV treatment , license first-line treatment . In combination Truvada速 , show few side effect compare efavirenz 2 clinical study , patient start HIV treatment first time . This study also investigate safety ( term side effect routine blood test ordinarily use monitor treatment ) monitor effectiveness , viral load CD4 count , switch treatment tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine .</brief_summary>
