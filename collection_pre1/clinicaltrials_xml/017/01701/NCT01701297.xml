	<brief_summary>Research question : Do oral probiotic patient cirrhosis ascites reduce intestinal bacterial concentration , ascitic bacterial DNA , SBP bacteraemia compare antibiotic placebo ? This study design investigate effect oral probiotic ( VSL # 3 ; mixture `` healthy '' bacteria intestine ) compare antibiotic placebo prevent infection develop abdominal fluid ( `` ascites '' ) collect patient advance liver disease ( `` cirrhosis '' ) . Patients already infection exclude study . Clear inclusion exclusion criterion meet patient monitor throughout study examine whether required hospitalisation , rate infection abdominal fluid elsewhere level liver function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VSL # 3 Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence cirrhosis increase UK . Decompensation herald poor outcome , mortality develop ascites approximately 50 % follow 1-2 year . Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) ascitic fluid reduces survival occurs due combination increase intestinal epithelial dysfunction , bacterial translocation mesenteric lymph node ascitic fluid , reduce opsonisation neutrophil function . Even antibiotic treatment , 3-month mortality SBP approximately 40 % result expensive in-patient care . Several study confirm benefit secondary prophylaxis long-term oral antibiotic patient advance liver disease ( e.g . norfloxacin , co-trimoxazole ) others suggest patient high risk develop SBP , primary antibiotic prophylaxis improve rate sepsis survival . Problems strategy include emergence bacterial resistance , development antibiotic-associated diarrhoea ( include C. difficile infection , high case-fatality rate cirrhosis ) . Local bacterial resistance profile association C. difficile infection favour choice co-trimoxazole study population . Patients advanced cirrhosis take co-trimoxazole previously demonstrate reduce liver-related outcome infection death3 . Probiotic preparation alter intestinal bacterial flora improve intestinal barrier neutrophil function . Faecal bacterial count E. coli Streptococcus ( organism commonly responsible SBP ) show 2-log fall probiotic , although whether could reduce incidence SBP remain unexamined .</detailed_description>
