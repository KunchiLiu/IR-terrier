	<brief_summary>This observational study collect information use performance-based measure survey questionnaires . It include intervention aim alter patient outcome . Advances pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) result improved survival prompt increased attention potential adverse late effect procedure . Survivors SCT think risk neurocognitive deficit result exposure number potentially neurotoxic agent . Prior study do group others demonstrate generally stable cognitive function first 5 year follow transplant , little evidence significant decline . However , almost research date status long-term ( &gt; 5 year post-transplant ) survivor . In study , evaluate large sample long-term survivor allogeneic SCT use measure intelligence , academic achievement , specific cognitive function attention , work memory process speed . We also obtain measure behavioral functioning quality life . We examine group survivor function relative normative expectation , comparison community control without history serious illness , match age , gender , race/ethnicity , socioeconomic status . We also examine relationship cognitive function psychosocial function quality life population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve one-time assessment use performance base measure well self- parent-report questionnaire . During yearly visit St. Jude , eligible patient agree participate undergo single neurocognitive evaluation . This evaluation take place Psychology Clinic . The administration time assessment battery estimate 2.5-3.5 hour , variability depend age patient speed completion task . All measure select study well-established psychometric property , include acceptable reliability validity . All measure standardize large , representative sample child adult age-specific norm . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To examine describe psychological outcome long-term ( &gt; 5 year ) survivor allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) childhood . This conducted one-time cross-sectional assessment use performance base measure survey questionnaire . Comparisons make establish normative data well validated standardized instrument control participant community without history serious illness , match age , gender , race/ethnicity socioeconomic status . - To describe global cognitive academic outcome SCT cohort use measure intelligence academic achievement . - To examine performance specific neuropsychologic domain , include work memory , process speed executive function . - To examine psychosocial function quality life among long-term SCT survivor use self- parent-report .</detailed_description>
