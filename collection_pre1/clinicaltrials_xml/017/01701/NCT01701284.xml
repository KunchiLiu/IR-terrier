	<brief_summary>Cancer lead cause mortality morbidity worldwide . In addition , cancer associate high rate depression anxiety among sufferer , cancer patient depression usually bad treatment outcomes long-term survival . Surprisingly , many cancer patient depression receive treatment depression , perhaps treatments cancer-related depression usually adapt used non-cancer population may suitable cancer patient . Moreover , cancer patient depression likely long latency anti-depressant drug action , negative drug-drug interaction cancer chemotherapy increase susceptibility systemic side effect . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) new treatment modality depression affect brain directly systemic side effect pose potential drug-drug interaction . rTMS therapy recently clear FDA antidepressant treatment treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder , evaluate wide array additional psychiatric indication . This randomized , open label , two-arm , pilot study investigate safety , tolerability , feasibility efficacy two form rTMS ( i.e. , leave ( fast ) right ( slow ) side rTMS ) cancer-related depression . The study hypotheses rTMS significantly reduce symptom depression right-sided slow rTMS effective left-sided fast rTMS treatment severe anxiety .</brief_summary>

Such drug could include neuroleptic ( ex . haloperidol , droperidol ) , clozapine , tricyclic antidepressant ( ex . amoxapine , clomipramine ) , bupropion ( particularly immediate release IR formulation ) donepezil , psychostimulants ( ex . methylphenidate ) , theophylline and/or drug reduce seizure threshold . For individual medicine , study clinician evaluate drug dose determine risk benefit . These discuss individual 's Primary Care Physician determine individual exclude study .</criteria>
