	<brief_title>Dabrafenib Alone Combination With Trametinib Before Surgery Treating Patients With Locally Regionally Advanced Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify marker intrinsic resistance v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ( B-RAF ) target therapy B-RAF mutation-positive melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine intrinsic resistance reverse mitogen activate protein kinase ( MEK ) target therapy identify biomarkers correlate response . II . To evaluate feasibility pre-surgical targeted therapy serial tumor biopsy patient advance , operable melanoma determine model use evaluate novel combination molecular target therapy future . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pre-surgical B-RAF MEK target therapy active well tolerated patient advance , operable melanoma . These finding may use support clinical trial un-resectable , B-RAF mutation-positive melanoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 add trametinib day 15-28 follow surgery day 28-30 . Treatment continue day prior surgery absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
