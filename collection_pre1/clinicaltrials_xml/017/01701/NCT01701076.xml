	<brief_summary>Almost patient multiple myeloma survive initial treatment eventually relapse require therapy . Background : Treatment lenalidomide dexamethasone proven efficacy two large randomize trial ( MM-009 MM-010 ) lead time progression ( TTP ) 17.1 month patient one prior therapy TTP 10.6 month 2 prior therapy , respectively [ 1-3 ] . Continuous treatment lenalidomide dexamethasone disease progression therefore consider standard therapy second line treatment multiple myeloma patient . However , relatively low rate high quality response ( CR , complete response VGPR , good partial response ) achieve . High quality response associate improved progression-free survival overall survival [ 4 ] . Trial : The aim trial improve high quality response rate patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma 2nd line treatment . This aim shall achieve addition third anti-myeloma drug ( bendamustine ) establish backbone lenalidomide/ dexamethasone . Treatment regimen : - Induction Treatment Phase : Cycles 1-6 Bendamustine 75mg/m2/d day 1 2 , lenalidomide 25mg/d 1-21 , dexamethasone 40mg / 20mg ( patient &gt; 75years ) 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . - Maintenance Treatment Phase : Cycles 7-18 lenalidomide 25mg/d 1-21 , dexamethasone 40mg / 20mg ( patient &gt; 75 year ) 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Due hematoxicity bendamustine lenalidomide , administration pegfilgrastim mandatory induction treatment phase ( BRd-regimen ) patient experience severe neutropenia . The aim study achieve high quality response rate ( CR , VGPR ) ≥ 40 % . If aim achieve , treatment bendamustine combination establish lenalidomide/ dexamethasone regimen consider promising . Besides efficacy , safety three-drug regimen evaluate trial .</brief_summary>
