	<brief_summary>Vitiligo acquire skin disease significantly impact quality life patient . Medical treatment vitiligo include use melanocyte transplantation result variable . This single center , single blind clinical trial compare another treatment also treatment design assess efficacy autologous monocyte transplantation monolayers substrate amniotic membrane treatment stable vitiligo . Patients receive two intervention , melanocyte suspension monolayer amniotic membrane provide untreated area control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melanocyte Transplantation Patients With Stable Vitiligo .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main Objective : The main objective ass efficacy autologous transplantation monocytes monolayers grown biological substrate amniotic membrane treatment stable vitiligo . Using system digital imaging analysis percentage re-pigmentation obtain studied 3 , 6 9 month treatment . Secondary Objectives : To demonstrate difference efficacy ( measure percentage re-pigmentation ) 2 technique use : pure melanocytes suspension amniotic membrane melanocytes monolayers . To assess rapidly epithelialization occur cosmetic result short long term area treat technique . To assess de-epidermization CO2 laser may stimulus reservoir melanocyte adjacent epidermis hair follicle re-pigmentation obtain procedure merely postinflammatory result trauma epidermis .</detailed_description>
