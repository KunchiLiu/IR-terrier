Fundamental element program include algorithms prompt proper timely implementation evidence-based treatment , structure outcome assessment systematic outreach . Telemedicine tool may represent valuable strategy improve depression outcome PC .

The study compare two different condition : - Group 1 ( experimental ) : GPs use Computer Decision Support System treatment algorithm advice supervision consultant psychiatrist . Patients receive reminder via mobile texting automatic mobile ( landline ) phone call improve adherence treatment prescribed . - Group 2 ( control ) : GPs provide TAU , make decision therefore use CDSS .
