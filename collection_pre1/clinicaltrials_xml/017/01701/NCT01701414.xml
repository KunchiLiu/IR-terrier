	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine ultrasound guide femoral nerve block ( localize anesthesia upper thigh ) provide effective pain relief adult patient hip fracture emergency department determine femoral nerve block use reduce use inject analgesia ( anesthesia ) , therefore also cause few adverse effect associate injected analgesia ( bruise site injection ) . 100 patient hip fracture enrol study . Patients randomly assign receive femoral nerve block ( FNB ) plus injected analgesia standard care ( SC ) , injected analgesia alone . Using guidance ultrasound machine , FNB group 20ml 0.5 % bupivacaine ( local anesthetic long duration ) inject front thigh , site pain . Patients randomized SC group receive injection saline ( saltwater ) neither patient treat physician know group patient randomize . All block perform emergency department emergency physician train use ultrasound ultrasound guide nerve block . Subjects ask rate pain numeric pain scale intervention ( 30 min , 60 min , 12 hr 24 hr injection , long patient ER still ) . Additional data collect include demographic , vital sign , course treatment result ED visit . Hypothesis : US-guided femoral nerve block provide effective pain control possibly decrease eliminate need narcotic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Femoral Nerve Blocks Elderly Patients With Hip Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture significant cause morbidity mortality elderly . In acute setting , safe effective pain control utmost importance . At present , typically achieve use parenteral opioids . However old individual , often medical comorbidities , use narcotic pain control must balance potentially deleterious consequence : namely respiratory depression , hypotension , mental confusion . Both poor pain control use opioid medication associate acute confusional state elderly . 1,2 Regional anesthesia possibly provide adjunctive even alternative pain control safe effective.Femoral nerve block , use local anesthetic , describe method reduce pain requirement systemic analgesia , specifically opioids . Prior research demonstrate feasibility effective pain control femoral nerve block ED setting . Bedside ultrasound ( US ) use precisely visualize femoral neurovascular anatomy perform femoral nerve block distinct advantage perform procedure ED setting . Study Objectives The primary aim study determine relative effectiveness ultrasound guide femoral nerve block older adult patient hip fracture emergency department compare parenteral narcotic alone . A secondary aim study determine femoral nerve block reduce use parenteral narcotic incidence adverse effect associate parenteral analgesia ( delirium , hypotension , respiratory depression ) hip fracture patient emergency department hospital stay .</detailed_description>
