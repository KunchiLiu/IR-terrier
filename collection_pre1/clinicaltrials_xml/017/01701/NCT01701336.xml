	<brief_title>Study Novel Therapeutic Vaccine Against Hepatitis C Using Ad6NSmut MVA-NSmut Chronically Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An effective antiviral T cell response mediate HCV viral control induce spontaneous resolution HCV primary infection . This observation strongly support case development T cell induction strategies potential therapy HCV . A hallmark persistent HCV infection , viral load high , weak narrowly focus HCV specific T cell response , whereas resolve infection undetectable viral load robust T cell response detect . A potent immunization strategy might overcome problem induce strong diversify cell mediate immune response HCV . The rationale use HCV vaccine combination PEG-IFN/RBV support , vitro model mathematical model HCV dynamic antiviral therapy . Studies viral dynamic suggest HCV RNA kinetics result sum two major action phase : inhibition viral production reduction infect cell number . The mathematical model , rely HCV-RNA alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) measure PEG-IFN/RBV therapy , suggest elimination infect cell immune system could play major role sustain viral reduction . This view accordance result recent study show IFN-γ , one cytokine secrete CTLs ( Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte ) NK ( Natural Killer ) cell , able inhibit HCV genomic subgenomic replication `` vitro '' model . In mathematical description parameter represent putative `` non lytic '' control HCV replication antiviral therapy φ , result difference π-δ0 , π δ0 time constant second phase decay viraemia infect cell , respectively . Interestingly , median value parameter φ , inversely related half-life HCV-RNA molecule infect cell phase 1 , significantly high sustained responder transient responder non responder ( NR ) . In addition , whereas baseline HCV-RNA production comparable patient regardless outcome , median value residual HCV-RNA production therapy significantly high NR responder . This data support hypothesis reach sustain response efficacious control infection , elimination infect cell relevant strong inhibition viral production . All consideration support hypothesis vaccination might new therapeutic opportunity cohort consecutive HCV genotype 1a 1b infected patient fail respond PEG-IFN/RBV therapy . Therefore potent induction T cell response chronically infect patient might use combination current antiviral therapy order achieve sustain response previously partial responder relapsers .</detailed_description>
