	<brief_summary>Fibroscan non invasive image investigation measure liver stiffness , know correlate well liver scar cirrhosis liver biopsy . Indocyanine green inert dye purely extract blood liver cell , hence excellent marker liver cell function overall liver blood flow . There little data either biomarkers regard outcome alcoholic liver disease . We aim establish accuracy liver biomarkers predict important liver relate outcome ( death , transplantation hospital readmission cirrhosis related consequence ) patient severe ( decompensated ) alcoholic liver disease . Moreover , ass whether serial measurement biomarkers impact alcohol abstinence , motivation quality life . Over 18 month period , 125 consecutive hospital inpatient decompensated alcoholic liver disease undergo baseline biomarker measurement , routine blood urine test qualitative questionnaire . These measure initial hospital admission ( 0 month ) subsequent repeat measurement follow visit 1 , 2 , 4 6 month . Each study visit time region 30-40 minute complete investigation . The end study individual patient patient death , liver transplantation 6 month study enrolment ; whichever occur first .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre longitudinal cohort feasibility pilot study patient decompensated alcoholic liver disease . We aim recruit 125 consecutive patient decompensated alcoholic liver disease 18 month period . This number base upon approximately 10 admission per month acute liver service decompensated alcoholic liver disease include presumed 20 % dropout rate follow , give total cohort 100 patient . Patients undergo maximum 6 month follow follow study recruitment . The purpose study : 1 . To assess performance diagnostic liver biomarkers ( Indocyanine Green , Fibroscan blood urinary biomarkers ) predict mortality decompensated alcoholic liver disease . 2 . To compare diagnostic prognostic end point biomarkers exist cirrhosis prognostic score system ( Child Pugh , MELD UKELD ) . 3 . To assess performance diagnostic biomarkers therapeutic aid quality life alcohol abstinence . Potentially eligible patient i.e . adult decompensated liver disease alcohol major co-factor , acutely admit secondary sequela hepatic decompensation , approach exist member clinical care team ( The CI &amp; Co-Investigators form part team ) . Any patient decides take part study baseline inpatient study visit either inpatient ward NDDC Biomedical Research Unit ( BRU ) . Subsequent follow visit BRU . Inclusion Criteria : - Male female patient 18-75 year age - Diagnosis cirrhosis base upon : - ) Histological confirmation - b ) Combination clinical radiological criterion - c ) Validated non invasive biomarker - Alcohol primary aetiology liver cirrhosis - Hospital admission relate decompensated liver disease ( e.g . ascites , varix , sepsis , alcoholic hepatitis ) - Active alcohol drink prior index hospital admission Exclusion Criteria : - Grade 3 4 hepatic encephalopathy - Hepatocellular carcinoma - Active non hepatic malignancy - Known complete portal vein thrombosis - Alcohol abstinence time index hospital admission - Pregnancy - Active cardiac device The research visit require measurement ICG clearance , Fibroscan , blood test , urine test questionnaire . They require attend study visit 1 , 2 , 4 6 month follow baseline study visit , study follow cease . Patients undergo study visit follow interval : - Baseline visit ( study visit 0 ) - 1 month ( study visit 1 ) - 2 month ( study visit 2 ) - 4 month ( study visit 3 ) - 6 month ( study visit 4 ) The follow data collect purpose research project baseline subsequent study visit : - Collection demography , anthropometry , drug history , smoking , alcohol intake , blood pressure , full blood count , renal function , liver function , coagulation serum sample - Brief abdominal examination detect presence moderate severe ascites ( purpose Child Pugh score measurement ) - ICG analysis - Transient elastography ( Fibroscan ) - Blood urinary biomarkers ( proteomics metabonomics ) - Chronic Liver Disease Quality Life Questionnaire - Alcohol intake assessment ( 28 Day AUDIT tool ) - Alcohol STAR tool qualitative assessment ( assess influence Fibroscan/ICG read motivation , beliefs alcohol abstinence ) Demography history take part normal clinical care . All patient offer standard follow outpatient hepatology clinic hospital alcohol liaison service throughout period study .</detailed_description>
