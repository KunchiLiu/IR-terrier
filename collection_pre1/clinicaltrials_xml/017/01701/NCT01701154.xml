	<brief_title>The Effects Respiratory Muscle Strength Training ( RMST ) Inspiratory Expiratory Muscle Strength Adults Children With Pompe Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory muscle weakness result substantial morbidity mortality individual almost form neuromuscular disease ( NMD ) , include infantile adult phenotype Pompe disease . Although individual pattern involvement vary , respiratory weakness Pompe disease typically affect inspiratory expiratory muscle system . Our pilot data two individual late-onset Pompe disease suggest RMST may treatment progressive respiratory weakness encounter condition . Purpose Study - Determine effect respiratory muscle strength train maximum inspiratory pressure , maximum expiratory pressure , upright % predict forced vital capacity , aspects cough function . - Determine effect RMST functional outcome measure gross motor function appropriate individual participant term age motor skill .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>include skin fibroblast acid αglucosidase ( GAA ) activity ≤1 % normal mean , minimum age 3 year , ability participate intensive RMST research program , ability maintain consistent amount nonresearch related physical activity course study . include medical problem preclude meaningful participation study , inability perform high effort respiratory task use maximum intensity , respiratory weakness profound RMST complete minimum pressure threshold available respiratory trainer , inability safely perform protocol . For example , high effort respiratory task occasionally associate mild , transient dizziness quickly dissipate follow brief rest . If severe and/or prolong dizziness occur particular case , exclusion study would necessary .</criteria>
