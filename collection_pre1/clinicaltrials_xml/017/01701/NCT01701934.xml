	<brief_title>Impact Roflumilast Visceral Adiposity Metabolic Profile Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although underweight traditional nutritional concern patient COPD , overweight obesity become important issue disease . In rehabilitation study , investigator find 66 % patient moderate severe COPD either overweight obese accord WHO obesity classification ( BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2 ) . Obesity COPD two frequent condition , important understand nature interaction . Obesity , particularly visceral form associate plethora metabolic consequence increase risk cardiovascular disease . This would seem relevant COPD important risk factor cardiovascular disease . The presence obesity , particularly visceral obesity , may thus define patient COPD clinical phenotype high risk cardiovascular disease . In context , relevant note prevalence metabolic syndrome increase COPD . Although fat distribution precisely assess COPD study , increase waist circumference common disease suggest visceral obesity part obesity syndrome see COPD . Given relationship COPD , obesity metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease , tempt suggest visceral obesity likely frequent COPD ( general population ) profound metabolic inflammatory perturbation associate form overweight/obesity could play central role link COPD cardiovascular disease . Roflumilast , Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor , recently evaluate anti-inflammatory medication patient COPD . Roflumilast , alone combination long-acting bronchodilator , provide modest significant improvement lung function along reduction rate exacerbation patient moderate severe COPD . A interesting observation make 12-month duration study use roflumilast associate average reduction body weight 2 kg take place first 6 month trial remain relatively stable throughout rest trial . The mechanisms precise effect roflumilast body composition adipose tissue distribution study great detail . However , available data suggest roflumilast induces preferential loss body fat mass comparison fat-free mass . It remain see whether roflumilast specifically affect visceral versus subcutaneous adipose tissue . The improved insulin sensitivity report one study presence apparently trivial weight loss ( 0.7 kg compare placebo ) may suggest selective loss visceral adipose tissue may produce response roflumilast therapy . These observation , although definitive , suggest roflumilast could use treat respiratory component COPD also modulate metabolic aspect disease include visceral adiposity , feature metabolic syndrome significant co-morbidities COPD .</detailed_description>
