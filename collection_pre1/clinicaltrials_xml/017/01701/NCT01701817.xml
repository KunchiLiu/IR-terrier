	<brief_summary>The Outcomes Registry Better Informed Treatment Atrial Fibrillation ( ORBIT-AF II ) multicenter , prospective outpatient disease registry evaluate utilization target-specific antithrombotic agent , FXa ( factor Xa ) inhibitor direct thrombin inhibitor , associate outcome . Importantly , ORBIT AF II registry permit collection analysis post-approval observational data need evaluate outcomes associate new agent use broad patient population outside clinical study . The ORBIT-AF II registry focus patient newly diagnose atrial fibrillation ( AF ) well recently start target-specific oral anticoagulant agent . Taken together , ORBIT-AF I ORBIT-AF II registry offer broad contemporary view AF therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The registry use evaluate , describe , document safety target-specific anticoagulant agent ( antithrombotic agent ) patient Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) , clinical outcome associate use , treatment pattern clinical course patient AF , include undergo cardiac procedure interest ( ablation , cardioversion , catheterization surgery , example ) , characteristic patient new onset/first-detected AF . Additionally , registry use summarize pattern switch discontinuation antithrombotic agent United States . The registry nationwide collaboration health care provider ( eg , cardiologist , internist , primary care physician , electrophysiologists , quality improvement personnel , office/practice manager , research coordinator , pharmacist ) . Target enrollment approximately 15,000 patient . It anticipate enrollment complete approximately 3.5 year . Consecutive patient meet eligibility criterion approach educate registry . Patients express interest provide inform consent . Patients enrol registry follow 2 year . New patient enrol registry follow 1 year . Patient follow-up AF care provider continue schedule accord local clinical practice . Data collection occur 6 month interval approximately 1 year time enrollment patient ( baseline , 6 , 12 month ) . Data capture include demographic , medical history , cardiovascular history , vital sign , echocardiographic laboratory data , AF status type ( paroxysmal , persistent , long-standing persistent/permanent ) , pharmacotherapy , contraindication oral anticoagulant therapy , provider specialty . Clinical outcome safety data capture include major adverse cardiac event ( MACEs ) .</detailed_description>
