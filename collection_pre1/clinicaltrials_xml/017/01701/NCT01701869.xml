	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fourth common cause death one common cause still rise . The main effect disease destruction inflammation lung tissue render breathe difficult . COPD significant effect quality life sufferer disease predict fifth common cause disability world 2020 . Patients COPD prone period worsen disease symptom , know exacerbation , often cause viral bacterial infection lung current vaccine appear little efficacy limit exacerbation . The loss lung function cause infectious exacerbation irreversible patient frequently exacerbate experience rapid disease progression . Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) major bacterial specie colonise airways cause exacerbation COPD . With development sensitive molecular technique possible ascertain acquisition new strain NTHi correlate strongly exacerbation . However , patient COPD NTHi lung question remain COPD patient susceptible infection . This study aim answer question compare airway COPD patient colonize NTHi analyse whether level protective antibody lung function immune cell NTHi colonize airway reduce . Moreover , aim correlate reduction immunity area lung damage ascertain high resolution compute tomography . The aim research well understand apparent deficiency airway immunity likely impact vaccine efficacy COPD .</brief_summary>

Subjects confirm diagnosis COPD ( base postbronchodilator spirometry ) . [ GOLD , 2009 ] FEV1 &gt; 80 % ( mild COPD ) &gt; 50 % ≤80 % ( moderate COPD ) predict normal FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 Subjects mild moderate COPD , accord Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) stag [ GOLD , 2009 ] . Subjects current prior history ≥10 pack year cigarette smoking . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month . Number pack year = ( number cigarette per day/20 ) x number year smoke . Subjects recent COPD exacerbation , stable condition , stop antibiotic , enrol one month post exacerbation . Subject also confirm diagnosis asthma ( cause obstructive respiratory disorder ) , cystic fibrosis , pneumonia risk factor ( e.g. , HIV , Lupus , Parkinson 's , Myasthenia Gravis ) respiratory disorder ( e.g. , tuberculosis , lung cancer ) . Subjects undergone lung surgery Subject α1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD . Subject experience moderate severe COPD exacerbation resolve least 1 month prior enrolment visit least 30 day follow last dose oral corticosteroid ( subject enrol acute AECOPD pneumonia resolve ) . Subject use antibacterial , antiviral respiratory investigational drug relevant vaccine 30 day prior enrolment visit . Subject condition principal investigator judge may interfere study finding , : Subject risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Evidence alcohol drug abuse .
