It hypothesize intravenous iron supplementation efficacious oral iron therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IVICA : Intravenous Iron Colorectal Cancer Associated Anaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients anemic time operation show increased frequency complication include wound infection longer post-operative admission . Similarly , patient anemic time cancer operation likely require blood transfusion may increase risk recurrence cancer . At present , oral iron often use treat anemia preoperatively attempt minimize risk . This drug often poorly tolerate due side effect profile . Blood transfusion also administer expose patient risk include infection transfusion associate reaction . In order overcome issue , intravenous iron preparation develop improved safety . This multi-center , randomize , open label clinical trial , look investigate efficacy intravenous iron treatment preoperative anemia colorectal patient . Patients randomize receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose ( treatment group ) oral ferrous sulphate ( control ) . The outcome review include amount frequency blood transfusion receive , change patient blood profile , patient quality life score , operative complication hospital length stay . The role hepcidin biomarker treatment response also assess . The primary hypothesis test intravenous iron decrease transfusion rate . To detect significant clinical difference blood transfuse consistent previous publish data ( 1 unit ) , 58 patient require arm study 90 % power ( alpha 0.05 ) . Randomization perform independently trial team use computer generate variable block randomization program . All data confidentially record Case Report Form , drug reaction side effect .</detailed_description>
