	<brief_summary>The investigator plan learn different level exercise feel people Type 2 Diabetes feel people without Type 2 Diabetes . This study team also look cause exercise feel hard easy people without Type 2 Diabetes . The investigator also compare potential benefit supervise exercise training diabetes education/blood sugar monitoring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Barriers Physical Activity People With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise potent therapy reduce cardiovascular mortality Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) . Although exercise cornerstone treatment T2D , people T2D sedentary similarly obese people without diabetes , reason unclear . Interventions combine behavioral support physical activity prescription successfully increase physical activity level people T2D at-risk T2D . However , program component mediate increased physical activity combine thus individual benefit component remain unknown . Given success combine program , appear behavioral support psychological factor may play important role . The study investigator interested predictor physical activity adherence T2D key target future intervention . One likely factor may influence physical activity adherence perceive exercise effort . The study investigator report , base small study , perceive exercise effort bad people T2D healthy obese control , measure Borg Rating Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) , even low intensity exercise . Thus , one strategy increase physical activity T2D first identify mediator RPE propose study address future study . The preliminary data suggest likely mediator RPE objective subjective nature . A key objective mediator RPE serum lactate level exercise , physiological marker effort , disproportionately elevated people T2D vs. healthy control . A key subjective mediator RPE self-efficacy , influence perception exercise effort , disproportionately bad people T2D vs. healthy control . To develop optimal physical activity intervention people T2D , study investigator must understand whether RPE difference vary across spectrum exercise intensity ( Aim 1 ) , investigator must also determine mediator RPE across exercise intensity ( Aim 2 ) . Mediators RPE low-to-moderate intensity exercise particularly important , walking preferred physical activity people T2D .</detailed_description>

Control subject must : HbA1C &lt; 5.7 % fast blood glucose &lt; 100 mg/dl suggest significant insulin resistance . All woman must postmenopausal , document menstrual history follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level . Those quit smoking least 1 year accept . Absence comorbid condition could affect exercise confirm history , physical examination laboratory test . Persons clinically evident distal symmetrical neuropathy , determine evaluation symptom ( numbness , paresthesia ) sign ( elicit vibration , pinprick , light touch , ankle jerk ) , exclude study neuropathy may limit exercise performance . Specifically , monofilament sensation absent level ankle , participant exclude study participation . Persons autonomic dysfunction ( &gt; 20 mm fall upright BP without change heart rate ) exclude well , due associate limitation exercise performance . Current use insulin oral hypoglycemic medication . Current smoker exclude since smoke impair cardiovascular ( CV ) exercise performance Persons exclude : evidence heart disease history ( Prior heart attack bypass surgery , heart failure , significant valvular disease ) abnormal rest electrocardiogram ( EKG ) consistent prior infarct latent ischemia ( unless cardiovascular stress image catheterization show coronary artery disease ) . leave right bundle branch block rest EKG ( precludes recognition ischemic EKG change exercise ) abnormal exercise EKG ( &gt; 1 mm ST segment depression 80 msec ST segment 3 consecutive beat ) .
