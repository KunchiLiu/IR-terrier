	<brief_summary>The main aim clinical trial find way give ch14.18/CHO , combination subcutaneous aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) oral isotretinoin ( 13-cis-RA ) , child young people primary refractory relapse neuroblastoma without intravenous morphine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Continuous Infusion ch14.18/CHO Plus s.c. Aldesleukin ( IL-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although lot child young people neuroblastoma cure current standard chemotherapy , sometimes , particularly relapse disease long respond standard drug . Therefore , need find new drug combination act neuroblastoma long respond standard drug . Ch14.18/CHO show improve outcome patient neuroblastoma . However , one side effect receive ch14.18/CHO severe pain . High dos intravenous morphine need control pain mean patient must stay hospital . Results clinical trial show give ch14.18/CHO long time reduces pain , yet drug still work well fight neuroblastoma . The clinical trial aim give ch14.18/CHO long time intravenous morphine need treatment regimen ultimately give outpatient set . Ch14.18/CHO monoclonal antibody . Monoclonal antibody make laboratory design bind specific cancer cell . Ch14.18/CHO design bind neuroblastoma cell cancer cell express GD-2 antigen . The GD-2 antigen express virtually neuroblastoma cell . An antigen substance stimulate immune response body produce antibody . Thus , ch14.18/CHO bind neuroblastoma cell , body 's immune system stimulate attack kill neuroblastoma cell . Ch14.18/CHO call chimeric , genetically engineer consist 30 % mouse-protein 70 % human protein . Ch14.18/CHO represent new kind cancer therapy , unlike chemotherapy radiation , target destruction cancer cell without destroy nearby healthy cell . There laboratory evidence suggest ch14.18/CHO activate body 's immune cell destroy cancer cell . These immune cell include killer cell activate stimulated aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) . Therefore treatment combination ch14.18/CHO aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) . Aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) substance similar substance make body individual . Under normal circumstance , body make small amount aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) help white blood cell fight infection . It possible make aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) laboratory give human much high dos body make . There evidence laboratory animal aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) increase anti-cancer effect monoclonal antibody like ch14.18/CHO . We wish study whether aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) help improve effectiveness ch14.18/CHO human . In addition ch14.18/CHO aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) , isotretinoin ( 13-cis-RA ) also give . Isotretinoin ( 13-cis-RA ) consider standard treatment patient neuroblastoma work induction neuroblastoma cell death .</detailed_description>
