	<brief_title>Compression Therapy Versus Surgery Treatment Superficial Venous Reflux</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Superficial venous reflux common adult population . Uncomplicated disease , skin change varicose vein without leg swelling , totally asymptomatic also cause various symptom pain , ache discomfort leg usually cause increased venous pressure . Varicose vein may also cause cosmetic problem . Compression stocking relief symptom normalize venous pressure . In surgical treatment , axial reflux treat usually remove incompetent superficial vein . The aim study compare conservative treatment compression stocking surgical treatment superficial venous reflux . In operative treatment great saphenous vein lesser saphenous vein remove flush ligation femoral vein strip trunk . If main trunk remove previously , axial refluating vein remove ligated accord DUS finding . The patient group examine baseline follow two year ultrasound scan . Patients clinical classification , venous disability score , venous disease severity score , anatomical path reflux well quality life study baseline , one year follow-up two year follow-up .</detailed_description>
