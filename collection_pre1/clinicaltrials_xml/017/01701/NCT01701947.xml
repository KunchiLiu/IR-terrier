	<brief_title>HEMOLEVENÂ® Expanded Access Program Prevention Surgical/Postpartum Hemorrhage Severe Inherited Factor XI Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient asymptomatic hemostatically challenge surgery trauma ; , diagnosis often make late childhood early adulthood always full liver maturation ( i.e . 6 month ) report Andrew et al . Spontaneous bleed rare , except menorrhagia , bleed occurs mainly surgery injury . Bleeding observe mainly surgical site high fibrinolytic activity mouth , nose , genitourinary tract . Pregnancy , labor delivery also challenge woman FXI deficiency . In 1999 study publish American Journal Hematology reveal FXI level inconsistent pregnancy . The incidence postpartum hemorrhage increase woman factor XI deficiency . The incidence 16 % primary postpartum hemorrhage FXI patient , compare 5 % general population . Moreover , incidence 24 % secondary postpartum hemorrhage comparison general obstetric population ( 0.7 % ) . The author recommend FXI level obtain initial visit monitor woman 's third trimester . For reason important woman suspect might FXI deficiency test diagnosed pregnancy . Severe factor XI deficiency define level &lt; 0.20 IU/mL . Such individual high probability post-operative hemorrhage . Individuals level 0.20 IU/mL low limit normal range , generally 0.65-0.80 IU/mL , generally classify partial mild deficiency low risk post-operative bleeding . Partial deficiency increasingly recognize follow pre-operative test result family screening . Thus partial factor XI deficiency often diagnose asymptomatic individual , create management dilemma unpredictability bleed risk . To differentiate isolated combine bleed disorder patient factor XI deficiency , cause bleed investigate excluded ( e.g . von Willebrand disease , platelet disorder ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Severe inherited factor XI deficiency ( FXI : C &lt; 0.20 IU/mL i.e . &lt; 20 % ) 2 . Patient old 6 month old weight least 8 kg 3 . Known personal bleeding history 4 . Patient require FXI replacement therapy oral antifibrinolytic agent alone mean ineffective contraindicate 5 . Scheduled undergo elective surgical procedure ( include caesarean section ) patient require hemostasis prophylaxis , case caesarean section due history postpartum bleeding , OR vaginal delivery patient require hemostasis prophylaxis due history postpartum hemorrhage 6 . Patient/guardian provide sign date Informed Consent 'HEMOLEVEN Expanded Access Program ' prior entry program 1 . Personal history thromboembolic event 2 . Underlying cardiopulmonary disease NYHA Class III great 3 . History severe reaction component HEMOLEVEN notably heparin derivative , include LMWH . Past history serious type II heparininduced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) 4 . Presence antibody FXI past currently 5 . Presence condition could contraindicate treatment factor XI concentrate lead Physician/Investigator believe treatment would best interest patient 6 . Positive , confirm pregnancy test patient undergo elective surgery ( applicable caesarean section prevention vaginal delivery ) 7 . Lactating woman . Of seven exclusion criterion , first four include precautionary safety measure ; fifth include avoid lack efficacy . The two last criterion include minimize confounding influence evaluation patient safety . Oral contraception mandatory pregnancy test schedule inclusion visit surgery .</criteria>
