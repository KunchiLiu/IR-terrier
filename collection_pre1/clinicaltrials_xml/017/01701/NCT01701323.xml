	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study infusion laboratory-grown donor cord blood cell follow combination chemotherapy treat young patient acute myeloid leukemia return respond treatment . Chemotherapy drug work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Chemotherapy also kill healthy infection-fighting cell , increase risk infection . The infusion laboratory-grown cord blood cell may able replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy . This may decrease risk infection follow chemotherapy , allow chemotherapy give cancer cell kill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety infuse `` off-the-shelf '' non-human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) match expand cord blood cell supportive care follow administration FLAG ( fludarabine phosphate , cytarabine , filgrastim ) consolidation reinduction chemotherapy pediatric young adult patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) acute leukemia ambiguous lineage . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess kinetics autologous recovery compare historical cohort . II . Assess ability product provide transient myeloid engraftment/recovery . III . Examine vivo persistence ex vivo expand cord blood cell determine kinetics durability potential engraftment . IV . Develop understand underlie immune interaction patient ( host ) infuse expand cord blood cell ( donor ) perform vitro analysis assess host-mediated rejection non HLA-matched expand cell . V. Estimate incidence clinically significant infection ( e.g . bacterial , viral , fungal ) observe patient treated FLAG consolidation reinduction chemotherapy follow `` off-the-shelf '' non-HLA match expanded cord blood cell . VI . Assess percentage patient achieve complete remission ( CR ) /complete remission incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) /complete remission partial recovery platelet count ( CRp ) therapy approach . VII . Assess long term efficacy ( overall survival [ OS ] /disease free survival [ DFS ] ) FLAG consolidation reinduction chemotherapy follow `` off-the-shelf '' non HLA match expand cord blood cell pediatric AML acute leukemia ambiguous lineage patient long term follow . OUTLINE : Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1-7 , fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day 2-6 , cytarabine IV 4 hour day 2-6 , ex vivo-expanded cord blood progenitor cell IV 30 minute day 8 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
