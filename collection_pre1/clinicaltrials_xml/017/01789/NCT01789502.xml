	<brief_title>Comparison Between Fully Covered Metal Stents Plastic Stents Preoperative Biliary Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreaticoduodenectomy curative option periampullary tumor . Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatog-raphy ( ERCP ) usually undertaken patient resectable disease relieve biliary obstruction , think impair immune response , clotting , function impact intraoperative postoperative outcome . Despite conflict data pertain preoperative biliary drainage , ERCP biliary stenting become standard practice patient periampullary malignancy . In recent multicenter randomize trial , patient underwent preoperative biliary drainage 74 % rate complication compare 39 % directly underwent surgery without preoperative biliary drainage . In trial , however , patient underwent placement plastic stent . In ERCP , self-expandable metal stent increasingly place palliation malignant biliary obstruction . Compared plastic stent , self-expandable metal stent large caliber demonstrate long patency duration . Even patient resectable malignant disease , self-expandable metal stent place level transection may impair technical outcome surgery safely remove along surgical specimen . This prospective study design compare incidence stent-related adverse event , re-intervention rate , effectiveness biliary drainage , surgical outcome hospital stay patient periamupllary tumor undergone self-expandable metal stent plastic stent placement preoperative biliary drainage</detailed_description>
