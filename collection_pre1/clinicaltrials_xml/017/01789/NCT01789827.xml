	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study aldesleukin image view tumor growth patient stage IV melanoma receive ipilimumab pembrolizumab therapy . Diagnostic procedure , single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , use radioactive drug scanner make detailed picture area inside body may less invasive way check stage IV melanoma . Radioactive drug , technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2 , carry radiation directly cancer cell may able differentiate tumor growth due inflammation versus tumor progression patient stage IV melanoma receive therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aldesleukin Imaging Viewing Tumor Growth Patients With Stage IV Melanoma Receiving Ipilimumab Pembrolizumab Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Feasibility/biodistribution 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 ( technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin 2 ) scintigraphy patient metastatic melanoma undergo immunotherapy either ipilimumab ( commercial source ) pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Correlation tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) invasion ( scintigraphy/histology ) tumor burden ; description clinical side effect associate image . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Correlation TIL invasion assess 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 scintigraphy vs. histology ( total subset TIL ) , well screen peripheral blood correlate . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 group . COHORT I : Patients undergo technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior receive ipilimumab pembrolizumab 12 week . COHORT II : Patients undergo technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior receive ipilimumab pembrolizumab , 3-4 week , 12 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30-45 day .</detailed_description>
