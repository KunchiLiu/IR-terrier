	<brief_title>A Phase I/IIa Study UV1 Vaccination Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label dose-escalating phase I/IIa study UV1 peptide vaccination patient NSCLC completion radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy . Patients enrol study achieve complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) least 4 week completion standard first line therapy . The following 2-step design use : 1 . Conventional dose escalation least 3 patient per dose level ( 3 select dose level ) . 2 . Expansion dose level total 6 patient assessment immune response level . 13 UV1 vaccination give first 6 month ( week 26 ) treatment , unless clinical deterioration unacceptable toxicity encounter . Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) ( Leukine ® ) use adjuvant 11 13 dos UV1 . After completion main study treatment period week 26 , patient agrees , additional vaccination may consider follow patient : - Immune responder within first 6 month - Immune non-responders provide least SD</detailed_description>
