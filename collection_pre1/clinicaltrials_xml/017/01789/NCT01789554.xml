	<brief_summary>Death cardiac disease one common cause death western world . The majority death take place outside hospital sudden cardiac death . However , immediate ( within minute ) action cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) defibrillation many life would save . CPR key factor increase survival Out Hospital Cardiac Arrest ( OHCA ) . CPR buys time support brain circulation wait defibrillator restart heart . In Sweden 2,5 million people trained CPR . However , half OHCA victim get CPR wait ambulance arrival . The aims Response Urgent Mobile message Bystander Activation ( RUMBA ) trial try new way logistics increase bystander CPR recruiting lay volunteer nearby OHCAs via mobile phone . Hypothesis : By dispatch lay volunteer nearby OHCAs mobile phone technology bystander CPR may increase 50 % 62,5 %</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Mobile Phones Out Hospital Cardiac Arrest Increase Bystander CPR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Survival out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) generally low , 5-10 % , exception control setting ( casino , airport city ) . The poor prognosis OHCA mainly explain long time interval cardiac arrest , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) defibrillation . To increase bystander action decrease time defibrillation substantial resource put CPR educational campaign recent year spread automated external defibrillator ( AEDs ) public venue . Still , vast majority public CPR training never use skill real life . Mobile phone technology offer possibility locate single mobile phone user give moment . If designate lay responder immediately identify recruit scene nearby suspect OHCAs bystander CPR , CPR quality finally survival might increase . Mobile phone position dispatch lay responder : Tailored mobile phone service use MPS locate select mobile phone user develop different purpose . A computer-based application mobile phone position dispatch lay responder develop purpose study refer Mobile Lifesaver Service ( MLS ) . All participant connect MLS call Mobile Responders ( MRs ) . The MLS act interface emergency medical service ( EMS ) data system MPS . The MLS handle localisation dispatch MRs base data present EMS data system . The location incoming call dispatch centre Sweden determine automatically . When dispatcher receive emergency call witness suspect OHCA dispatcher activate MLS parallel standard EMS . When MLS activate us MPS compare current geographical position MRs connect MLS position incoming emergency call suspect cardiac arrest . If one MRs present within radius 500 ( optional ) suspect arrest MRs receive cardiac arrest alert computer generate phone call text message ( i.e . SMS = short message system ) information place suspect cardiac arrest . A map find way suspect OHCA also send . Additional information , need , send MRs. For detail see `` Mobile phone technology identifies recruit train citizen perform CPR out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victim prior ambulance arrival . '' Ringh M , Fredman D , Nordberg P , Stark T , Hollenberg J. Resuscitation . 2011 Dec ; 82 ( 12 ) :1514-8 . Data earlier non randomize pilot study urban Stockholm show CPR perform MLS dispatch lifesaver prior ambulance , firefighter police 20 % case true OHCAs . The hypothesis bystander CPR Stockholm County increase 50 % 62,5 % MLS use . An estimate number 6000 MR need base earlier pilot study . The current proportion bystander CPR derive OHCA registry data uncertain . A safety efficacy analyze make approximately 200 true OHCA case . A ethical safety board log adverse event set .</detailed_description>
