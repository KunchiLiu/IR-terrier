	<brief_title>Cluster Randomized Trial Comparing Interventions Enhance Genetic Counseling Among Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 5-10 % breast cancer patient hereditary breast cancer , majority due inherit mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene ( BRCA mutation carrier ) . Breast cancer patient BRCA mutation carrier 65 % risk new primary breast cancer future . Additionally , BRCA mutation carrier 10-45 % lifetime risk ovarian cancer . Effective option decrease high future cancer risk available breast cancer patient learn carry BRCA mutation - include prophylactic mastectomy oophorectomy . Prophylactic mastectomy oophorectomy reduce risk future primary breast cancer ovarian cancer , respectively , 90 % . Because high risk future cancer opportunity effective risk reduction among mutation carrier , national guideline consistently recommend referral breast cancer patient increase risk hereditary breast cancer ovarian cancer ( HBOC ) genetic counseling qualify genetics professional . Lack implementation standard care constitute error omission jeopardize patient outcome . We propose cluster randomize control trial compare `` passive intervention '' - dissemination professional guideline - `` active intervention '' - multi-faceted provider education decision support intervention improve 1 ) appropriate referral breast cancer patient risk HBOC genetic counseling community cancer center set 2 ) pre-surgical referral among newly diagnose patient . Ultimately , result lead decreased breast ovarian cancer incidence mortality among breast cancer patient family member , well improve outcome satisfaction surgical decision-making .</detailed_description>
