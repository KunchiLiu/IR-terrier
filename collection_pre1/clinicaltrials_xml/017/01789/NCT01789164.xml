	<brief_summary>The goal project determine possible ass Cerebrovascular Reactivity ( CVR ) hypercapnia functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) . Such method would particularly helpful traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , objective measure need , would greatly expand capacity make assessment standard clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measure Cerebrovascular Dysfunction After TBI With fNIRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prospective study design consist two study group ; experimental group control group . In Experimental Group ( Group 1 ) enroll adult participant TBI persistent post-concussion symptom abnormality neuropsychological test . In Group 2 enroll adult participant serve age gender-matched healthy control . Our goal recruit 100 subject total two group age gender match subject , follow : TBI ( n = 50 ) non-TBI ( n = 50 ) . Participants group undergo NIRS test hypercapnia challenge , measure increase hemodynamic flow signal hypercapnia challenge via 2 method , breath hold Douglas bag method . We test intersessional validity NIRS-hypercapnia challenge first 20 ( 10 TBI 10 non-TBI ) subject willing return second visit repeat test . The NIRS system compose 4 light source 10 detector 16 point configuration system apply forehead subject . In experiment , light intensity collect detector transform signal related local concentration oxy- de-oxyhemoglobin challenge . Each experiment give set subject data , consist peak amplitude time-to-peak hemodynamic signal measure .</detailed_description>
