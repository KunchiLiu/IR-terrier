	<brief_summary>Early stent thrombosis note increased frequency acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treat bivalirudin clopidogrel . The brief half life bivalirudin act concert delay action clopidogrel likely expose patient thrombosis vulnerable period reduce antiplatelet effect immediate post stenting period . Combination therapy bivalirudin prasugrel conceptually attractive rapid onset action prasugrel could potentially significantly diminish vulnerable period , likely reduce potential acute stent thrombosis . The trial document efficacy prasugrel compare clopidogrel , general , report patient bivalirudin utilized . Currently , United States , bivalirudin commonly use adjunctive agent use PCI . Using light transmission aggregometry , study examine inhibition platelet aggregation patient randomize treatment clopidogrel v prasugrel vulnerable period follow discontinuation bivalirudin therapy . The investigator anticipate study document significant enhancement inhibition platelet aggregation patient randomize prasugrel treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) target coronary lesion patient coronary syndrome lead iatrogenic endothelial disruption heighten platelet activation aggregation . Blocking platelet aggregation glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa inhibitor demonstrate unequivocal benefit combine heparin patient undergo PCI . Heparin-mediated thrombin inhibition establish therapy safely perform PCI , however , several well know limitation heparin include variable anticoagulant effect due nonlinear pharmacokinetics inconsistent bind blood protein . In addition , heparin effectively block clot-bound thrombin may cause thrombocytopenia . The direct thrombin inhibitor ( DTI ) , bivalirudin , bind high affinity exosite I thrombin , may safer alternative commonly use pharmacologic PCI adjuncts expert consensus document define `` reasonable use alternative unfractionated heparin GP IIb/IIIa antagonists low-risk patient undergo elective PCI '' . The ACUITY trial support use bivalirudin patient unstable coronary syndrome . This study show similar rate ischemic event less bleeding compare patient treat heparin GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor . Similar result report REPLACE-2 randomized trial , study patient population lower prevalence acute coronary syndrome . Recent result laboratory suggest least part salutary effect DTIs due reduction thrombin less extent , collagen-mediated platelet activation . Inhibition platelet P2Y12 Adenosine Diphosphate ( ADP ) receptor standard care add aspirin patient undergo coronary stenting . A 600 mg load dose clopidogrel lead enhanced inhibition platelet aggregation reduction adverse clinical outcome Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( NSTEMI ) patient undergo coronary stenting compare 300 mg. Other study document compare 300 600 mg loading dos clopidogrel , 60 mg load dose prasugrel document eventuate faster onset , great magnitude consistent level platelet inhibition measure light transmission aggregometry . Several study document significantly great platelet inhibition prasugrel treatment compare high-dose clopidogrel therapy . The potent P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonist prasugrel significantly reduce composite endpoint cardiovascular death , nonfatal MI , nonfatal stroke higher-risk ACS patient refer PCI . The salutary effect referable prasugrel treatment study mostly due reduction incidence myocardial infarction . In HORIZONS AMI trial patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction underwent primary PCI , anticoagulation bivalirudin alone , compare heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor , result significantly reduce 30-day rate major bleed net adverse clinical event . Despite result laboratory document profound bivalirudin-mediated effect platelet aggregation , close analysis HORIZONS AMI trial document high acute stent thrombosis rate bivalirudin oppose GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor treat patient . The investigator recently document half life bivalirudin , currently utilize dose cardiac intervention 29.3 minute . The relatively short half life DTI concert relatively long time period require activate clopidogrel prodrug active metabolite , likely expose patient vulnerable period suboptimal platelet inhibition . It plausible vulnerable period platelet activity inhibit proximate cause early stent thrombosis HORIZONS trial . Consequently , earlier act , potent thienopyridine therapy , i.e . prasugrel , combine bivalirudin treatment potential reduce bleeding ( compare GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor ) prevent peri-procedural MI well provide protection platelet-mediated stent thrombosis ( compare clopidogrel ) vulnerable period follow PCI . The overwhelming majority publish data examine clinical outcome in-vivo pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic difference clopidogrel prasugrel do PCI patient bivalirudin either use use infrequently , i.e . le 10 % studied patient . However , present time United States , bivalirudin preeminent antithrombotic adjunctive therapy use PCI . Consequently , comparative data regard effect prasugrel clopidogrel platelet function bivalirudin-treated patient significant clinical importance .</detailed_description>
