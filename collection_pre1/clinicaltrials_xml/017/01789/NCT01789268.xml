	<detailed_description>This clinical study investigate relationship sequential respiratory viral infection , pattern intestinal respiratory bacterial colonization , adaptive cellular immune phenotype associate increased susceptibility respiratory infection long term respiratory morbidity preterm full term infant . This prospective , cohort study , enrol single center via two site ( URMC URMC-affiliated Highland Hospital Rochester General Hospital ) . Enrollment accomplish approximately 15 - 36 month . The study enroll 280 subject , 150 pre-term 130 full-term . This protocol study agent intervention . However , bronchodilator , albuterol , beta 2 agonist , administer part Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography ( RIP ) pulmonary function assessment . All infant remain study 3 year plus 17 week , depend gestational age birth . The full-term infant expect typically develop newborn generally healthy . Enrolled newborns sample cord blood ( CB ) evaluation lymphocyte phenotype baseline neutralize antibody titer . Maternal saliva sample collect test exposure environmental tobacco smoke . A nose , throat rectal swab obtain assessment respiratory gut microbiome test known respiratory pathogen pathogen discovery . Prior hospital discharge , infant evaluation lymphocyte phenotype function , undergo respiratory assessment via RIP prior bronchodilator . Co-morbidities , familial environmental risk factor atopy , asthma respiratory symptom assess . Following hospital discharge , baby ( full-term former preterm infant ) follow longitudinally 3 year CGA outpatient . During first year follow-up , infant rectal nose , throat swab obtain monthly . Screening symptomatic respiratory dysfunction illness also occur time follow-up per schedule .</detailed_description>
