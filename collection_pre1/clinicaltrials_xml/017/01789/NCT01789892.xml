	<brief_title>Methylprednisolone Before Fludeoxyglucose-Labeled Positron Emission Tomography Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether premedication corticosteroid may reduce false positive finding fluorodeoxyglucose ( fludeoxyglucose F 18 [ FDG [ ) PET/computed tomography ( CT ) scan lung cancer patient , reduce radiotracer uptake thoracic lymph node related inflammation . OUTLINE : Within 1-14 day undergo standard FDG PET/CT scan , patient receive methylprednisolone intravenously ( IV ) undergo second FDG PET/CT scan . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
