	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate efficacy intensive locomotor intervention early post stroke . An intensive locomotor training ( LT ) program compare active control , conventional physical therapy . It propose early intensive step paradigm typically employ early physical therapy lead superior outcome improve community mobility . A randomized , blind , control trial test subject moderate severe locomotor dysfunction individual post-stroke compare walking-related outcome intensive gait training ( include treadmill , overground , stair training , skilled walk training ) outcomes conventional physical therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Aim 2 , intensive gait training overground treadmill use device appropriate provide use randomize , control trial ( RCT ) design . Determination optimal swing phase propulsive assistance provide subject maximize treadmill walk velocity ( Aim 1 ) necessary ass efficacy technique improve walk function prolong LT session . Consistent work previous grant cycle12 , compare relative improvement impairment , activity participation follow 1 2 , 8 -week intervention improve walk ability post-stroke . Fifty-six ( 56 ) subject recruit , stratify base walk 10 meter [ require moderate assistance ( subject perform 50-74 % ) , minimal assistance ( subject perform great 75 % gait still need assist ) , gait speed &lt; 0.5m/s without assist , gait speed &gt; 0.5-0.9m/s without assist . Subjects randomize experimental ( intensive gait training use aforementioned gait training principle ) control condition ( conventional physical therapy ) . The test group receive 40 , 40-minute LT session 60 minute time period 8 week subject ambulate treadmill , overground , stair . During first 5 training session , LT take place solely treadmill . After time , half session walk overground stair half treadmill . Training perform target heart rate 70-80 % heart rate reserve ( HRR ) subjective rating perceive exertion 14-17 patient medication limit heart rate kinetics . Kinematics LT monitor visually ensure proper foot placement necessary continuous step maintain appropriate intensity , use device necessary . The control group receive conventional physical therapy ( receive least 3 session physical therapy per week ) subject 's medical team ' discretion ( day rehabilitation , outpatient , home health ) . If subject receive least 3 session physical therapy per week , control therapy treatment provide consistent recent data detail amount specific physical therapy activity provide single-session outpatient visits19and publish data21 well unpublished data Moore delineate number step take per conventional therapy session base gait speed individual ( number step training=1500*gait speed+200 ) . The additional 200 step add algorithm allow individual require assist receive gait training session . Clinical quantitative assessment neuromuscular cardiopulmonary impairment , limitation activity participation , assessment corticospinal tract ( CST ) excitability integrity perform prior training , mid-training , end 8 week training , 2-6 month follow-up examination . Control group participant option participate 4 week intensive gait training ( experimental protocol ) end follow test complete one test session end 4 week . Primary outcome measure include laboratory community measure ambulatory function , include gait speed short distance , distance walk gait efficiency 6 min walk , amount daily community stepping ( use Step Activity Monitors [ SAM ] 20 ) , CST excitability measure use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) ( optional ) assessment white matter tract integrity use MRI ( optional ) .</detailed_description>
