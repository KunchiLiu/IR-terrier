	<brief_summary>The use hormone contraception pose significant challenge estimate 16 million HIV-infected woman childbearing age . This due know drug interaction antiretroviral therapy ( medicine use treat HIV ) may jeopardize contraception effectiveness . By evaluate impact antiretroviral therapy levonorgestrel subdermal implant , widely available hormone implant low middle-income country , study translate finding evidence-based approach co-manage important medication . The investigator hypothesize woman receive nevirapine efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy significant decrease mean levonorgestrel plasma concentration measure six month implant 's insertion compare woman take antiretroviral therapy . Although implant 's efficacy may retain initially , investigator propose decrease levonorgestrel concentration woman receive antiretroviral therapy may jeopardize implant 's effectiveness near end intend duration use ( 5 year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Levonorgestrel Implant Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Family planning service , include hormone contraceptive , critical HIV-infected woman , prevention unintended pregnancy decrease maternal child mortality , also reduce risk mother-to-child HIV transmission . Similarly , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) lifesaving intervention improve health economic status HIV-infected woman throughout world . Therefore , significant public health importance guide appropriate use essential medication . To end , million HIV-infected woman low middle income country ( LMIC ) currently use gain access subdermal progestin-containing implant preferred method long-acting reversible contraception . These implant often combine ART despite lack critically need pharmacokinetic ( PK ) drug-interaction data inform safe effective concomitant use . Highlighting concern several case report unintended pregnancy occur patient subdermal progestin-containing implant concurrently receive non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -based ART , commonly use ART LMICs . While NNRTIs know significantly decrease oral pill progestin concentration , data available inform healthcare provider impact NNRTIs progestin concentration follow release subdermal implant . To fill critical gap knowledge , overall aim proposal conduct PK study evaluate combination levonorgestrel ( LNG ) implant NNRTI ( nevirapine efavirenz ) -based ART HIV-infected Ugandan woman . The investigator propose low LNG concentration observe patient NNRTI-based ART although implant 's efficacy may retain initially , negative interaction jeopardize implant effectiveness near end intend duration use ( 5 year ) . The specific aim project ( 1 ) characterize PK LNG release subdermal implant one year HIV-infected woman without NNRTI-based ART ( 2 ) evaluate potential bidirectional drug-interaction result long-term impact chronic progestin exposure antiretroviral concentration . To achieve aim , study enroll 20 HIV-infected woman three study group : control group receive ART two treatment arm consist patient receive nevirapine- efavirenz- base ART . Using sparse PK sampling strategy , LNG , nevirapine efavirenz concentration measure one-year compare within group , appropriate . The LNG data also use develop PK model predict LNG disposition follow three year intend use , allow identification safe duration LNG implant use woman NNRTI-based ART . At conclusion project , first evidence-based medical knowledge available guide safe effective concomitant use subdermal LNG implant NNRTIs , thereby improve management reproductive health million HIV-infected woman worldwide .</detailed_description>
