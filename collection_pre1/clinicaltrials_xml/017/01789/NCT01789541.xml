	<brief_summary>Overt hyperthyroidism ( so-called `` goiter '' lay language ) hormonal disturbance know increase risk atrial fibrillation ( common heart arrhythmia potentially severe consequence ) patient . Previous research indicate even slight elevation thyroid hormone level - call subclinical hyperthyroidism - may increase risk . When atrial fibrillation overt hyperthyroidism find simultaneously patient , hormonal imbalance must treat first order later resolve arrhythmia . It unclear whether strategy hold true subclinical hyperthyroidism . Our two hypothesis : 1 ) Subclinical hyperthyroidism prevalent patient admit atrial fibrillation ablation population whole , 2 ) Patients subclinical hyperthyroidism atrial fibrillation benefit less ablation others . As control group , choose patient admitted ablation AV-nodal Reentry Tachycardia clinic case . No correlation ever show AV-nodal Reentry Tachycardia hyperthyroidism .</brief_summary>
