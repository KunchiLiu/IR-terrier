	<brief_summary>Preliminary data follow pilot study institution confirm ability 99mTc-glucosamine ( 99mTc-ECDG ) differentiate active , subclinical quiescent disease patient rheumatoid arthritis , scleroderma lung , vasculitis . We propose extend finding evaluate image modality clinical utility , limitation , application . An unacceptably high level morbidity exist amongst patient suffer rheumatic disease . This often result mild disease miss misdiagnosed , therapy inordinately delayed inappropriate . The currently use therapeutic agent associate side-effects add unfavourable clinical outcome . There therefore need superior , less expensive easily accessible image modality assess degree inflammation guide clinician . Glucosamine absorb metabolised manner dissimilar glucose , readily label form 99mTc-ECDG . Scans acquire within 3 hour intravenous administration agent , accurately depict site active inflammation/disease . HYPOTHESIS Glucose vital cellular substrate accumulates inflame tissue great metabolic need cell active disease . Glucosamine , analogue glucose , metabolise quickly inflame non-inflamed tissue thus 99mTc-ECDG scintigraphy like 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18FDG-PET ) scintigraphy allow detection active inflammation . Unlike current bone scan agent sensitivity detect subclinical inflammatory disease would turn provide essential information ensure accurate diagnosis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . To evaluate role 99mTc-ECDG Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . Both monitor diagnostic tool . Approach . Three separate cohort patient suffer RA recruit ; 1 . Patients newly diagnose RA ; 2 . Patients active long-standing RA treatment anti-TNF ; 3 . Patients RA remission without anti-TNF treatment . 5-10 patient recruit cohort . In order provide write consent patient older 18 year old . Exclusion criterion include patient allergy glucosamine seafood , patient end-stage renal hepatic disease , pregnancy lactation . No restriction impose treatment patient able receive underlie rheumatic condition , medical condition study . Patients required cease glucosamine therapy three day prior injection radiotracer . An evaluation patient 's history physical examination conduct prior tracer administration . All relevant disease document well concurrent illness treatment regime . A rheumatologist ass disease severity document per recommendation outline PBS guideline subsidise treatment ( HIC - Medicare Australia ) . Biological marker disease acquire patient time clinical assessment , include ESR , CRP level , rheumatoid factor anti-citrullinated peptide antibody . Similar assessment undertaken six monthly interval three year . These result use correlate scan finding . Patients cohort A &amp; B initial scan acquire prior commencement therapy . Scans repeat six month later patient . Results analyse per patient basis per joint basis . AIM 1a . To correlate 99mTc-ECDG joint uptake clinical parameter disease . The scan finding group grade nuclear medicine physician ( SA ) note pattern tracer uptake intensity tracer uptake . Relative tracer activity joint correlate activity brain / skull ( essentially uptake evident ) . In addition , neighbour muscle tissue , liver cardiac blood pool activity two scanning time point ( 15 120 minute ) evaluate . A four point ( 0-3 ) grade system utilised semi-quantify scan finding , follow : 0 - Nil uptake - define increased / minimally increase tracer activity region interest ( ROI ; activity approximates uptake brain ) ; 1 . - Mild - tracer uptake ROI approximate neighbour muscle tissue ; 2 . - Moderate - tracer uptake ROI great vicinity heart ; , 3 . - Severe - tracer uptake ROI approximate liver . The scan finding compare clinical parameter document time study follow-up assessment ( outlined aim 1 ) . This enable investigator assess disease progression remission time . It thus possible evaluate predictive nature scan finding respect . AIM 1b . To evaluate 99mTc-ECDG joint uptake difference treatment . That , predict response therapy . One purpose follow-up identify change disease activity time . The clinical scan finding time recruitment compare corresponding finding follow-up assessment ( outline Aim 1 &amp; 1a ) . Patients cohorts A &amp; B permit assessment clinical response therapy . Thus , regression disease activity otherwise , correlate difference depict scan acquire baseline six month later . In cohort B , 99mTc-ECDG scan acquire baseline 6 month later inadequate responder conventional therapy compare favourable clinical response . Follow-up study patient cohort C ( disease remission ) provide information regarding : - reproducibility scan finding patient remain clinically stable , - significance probable subclinical disease ( increased tracer uptake joint patient otherwise asymptomatic baseline study change observe follow-up scan ) , - sensitivity detect recurrent disease ( change tracer distribution joint become inflamed intervening period ) . AIM 1c . To correlate finding 99mTc-ECDG image modality , include bone scintigraphy 18FDG-PET scintigraphy . In least 3 RA patient wide range disease activity , bone scan perform within 72h 99mTc-ECDG . At least 3 patient also undergo 18FDG-PET scintigraphy . These scan evaluate experienced nuclear medicine physician ( SA ) , correlate patient profile 99mTc-ECDG scan finding . These cohort enable value different clinical information provide imaging technique complementary nature evaluate . It anticipate study take 30 month complete . All patient recruit aim recruit patient first 12 month follow least 24 month . AIM 2 . To investigate role 99mTc-ECDG detect seronegative spondyloarthritis . Distinguishing back-pain related disease flare-up/progression alternative cause ( osteoarthritis , disc pathology ) patient early AS difficult . Therapy cause-specific . Inappropriate application therapeutic regime delay recovery often lead unforeseen complication poor outcome ( eg . steroid-related osteoporotic vertebral crush fracture ) . Plain X-rays , CT scan MRI effectively highlight irreversible chronic change disease . However , technique seldom detect early pathogenic change , amendable therapeutic intervention . 99mTc-ECDG , virtue ability accumulate site inflammation , appear successful identify early mild disease . Furthermore , pattern tracer distribution assist differentiate compete diagnosis . A control group 10-15 patient mechanical back pain used control 10-15 AS patient vary degree disease activity recruit . TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy administer patient meet necessary guideline scan perform pre post treatment . Repeat study acquire 6 month later patient . A comparison clinical finding , document experienced Rheumatologists regular six-monthly follow-up three year conduct . The predictive value scan respect treatment response also assess outlined Aim 1b . MRI scan , gold standard sacro-ileitis , acquire within 72 hour 99mTc-ECDG scan , comparison finding lumbo-sacral region . A number patient also undergo bone scintigraphy / 18FDG-PET scintigraphy ( outlined Aim 1c ) , evaluate comparative value alternate image modality .</detailed_description>
