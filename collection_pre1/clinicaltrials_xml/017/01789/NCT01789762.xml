	<brief_summary>This study multicentre , double-blind , randomize therapeutic trial . The primary objective study evaluate non-inferiority regard prevention control haemorrhage : - platelet concentrate treat pathogen reduction ( Intercept amotosalen UVA procedure ) - compare usual platelet concentrate ( additive solution intersol ) , reference arm , - compare platelet concentrate re-suspended autologous plasma ( historic arm ) These three product available authorised ANSM ( formerly AFSSAPS ) . The secondary objective evaluate transfusion need , transfusion outcome safety decrease frequency grade 2 high side effect relate transfusion allergy platelet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There unresolved difficulty evaluation haemorrhagic symptom thrombocytopenia due nature scale , international standard time ( WHO scale ) . This scale base level blood loss applicable haemostasis disorder . We keep standard decide particularly rigorous data collection perform daily haemorrhagic assessment . Several sequence miss data impute one patient . Each sequence miss data replace number consecutive day miss exceed 15 % * total length patient 's stay . If one sequence miss data longer 15 % , replacement do patient . ( Example : If total stay 30 day , maximal length miss data sequence accept 4 day ) . The following strategy use replace miss data : • The first observation miss : Next observation carry backwards ( NOCB ) assign next know score miss value miss one . • The last observation miss : Last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) assign last known score miss value miss one . ( Suppose situation stable whilst patient leave hospital . ) • Sequence one several miss data non-missing data sequence : Last Next1 assigns average person 's last known next know observation miss value . The score round near whole number need . ( Ex mean ( 1+2 ) =1 ) * 15 % round near whole number . 1 : Engels , J.M . 2003 . Imputation Missing Longitudinal Data : Comparison Methods . Journal Clinical Epidemiology 56 ( 2003 ) 968-976 Following quality analysis EFFIPAP study 's recruitment , decide sponsor increase number patient . Approximatively thirty additional patient include order replace non analyzable patient follow reason : wrongly include , non-transfused patient , consent withdrawal . Those 30 additional patient allow u reach initial target 810 analyzable patient order respond main objective study</detailed_description>
