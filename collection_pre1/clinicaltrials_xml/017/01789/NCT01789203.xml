	<brief_summary>BK infection important cause graft dysfunction graft loss renal transplantation . It widely accept emergence BK virus correlate potent immunosuppressive agent use low acute rejection rate . In contrast opportunistic infection transplantation , routine prophylactic agent administer , effective agent prevention BK infection . Some data , however , suggest quinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin may activity BK virus . This lead u investigate whether routine , short-term ciprofloxacin administration post-transplant low incidence BK infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ciprofloxacin Prevention BK Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BK virus member virus family polyomaviridae ( `` polyoma '' ) . The virus , manifest viral nephritis , first describe renal transplant recipient 1971 , however past decade infection BK virus become know important contributor graft dysfunction graft loss renal transplantation . It widely accept emergence BK virus correlate potent immunosuppressive agent currently use low acute rejection rate . In contrast opportunistic infection transplantation , routine prophylactic agent administer , effective agent prevention BK infection , effective agent treat BK infection occur . Ciprofloxacin well know anti-infective agent fluoroquinolone class antibiotic . It active gram-negative enteric pathogen , commonly use variety infectious indication . Though classified antibacterial agent , fluoroquinolones suggest exhibit anti-BK viral effect interfere helicase activity BK virus large T antigen . Ciprofloxacin show previous study reduce urine BK viral load , BK-associated hemorrhagic cystitis stem cell transplant population . Ciprofloxacin also associate low incidence BK viremia one retrospective study kidney transplant recipient . Based report , investigator hope find reduction BK viremia BK nephropathy use prospective , randomized study design .</detailed_description>
