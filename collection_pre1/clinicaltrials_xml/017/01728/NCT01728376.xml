	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy Daptomycin Versus Standard Care ( SOC ) 1 - 17 Year Olds With Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteremia ( MK-3009-005 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>S. aureus cause series invasive disease adult child , include bacteremia . Infections due S. aureus child , particularly due methicillin resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) , grow world-wide public health concern . Daptomycin , cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent , show rapid vitro bactericidal activity concentration-dependent kill Gram-positive organism , include S. aureus . Surveillance study demonstrate daptomycin MIC90 0.5µg/ml methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ( MSSA ) MRSA &gt; 99 % MRSA isolate categorize susceptible Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , European Committee antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( EUCAST ) Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) breakpoints ( 5 ) . Clinical trial adult demonstrate daptomycin safe efficacious complicate skin skin structure infection ( cSSSI ) bloodstream infection cause S. aureus , include right-sided infective endocarditis ( RIE ) . However , information safety efficacy daptomycin use child lack . The intent study child confirm safety daptomycin mean steady state systemic exposure ( AUC ) similar report adult treat 6 mg/kg bacteremia .</detailed_description>
