	<brief_title>Emphysematous Lung Sealant Therapy Homogeneous Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigational , single arm , physician-sponsored study conduct Rabin Medical Center direction Professor Mordechai Kramer . Patients receive AeriSeal System therapy use new treatment algorithm deliver approve foam sealant component dose previously show safe effective prior study . Investigational aspect study involve method administration material , material . The specific modification treatment method propose study include : 1 ) lower dose per subsegment AeriSeal System Foam Sealant 10 mL approve 20 mL dose ; 2 ) administer subsegmental dos anatomic location goal improve distribution material achieve effective lung volume reduction ; 3 ) eliminate administration air instrument channel bronchoscope follow Foam Sealant delivery simply shorten procedure , improve safety . The study design treat 8 patient . The first 4 patient receive treatment 10 mL AeriSeal System Foam Sealant administer 6 subsegments , 3 upper lobe ( dose 60 mL AeriSeal Foam Sealant ) . This group follow 4 complete 1 month ( 28 day ) follow-up . A safety review data conduct prior initiate treatment next group 4 patient . This review include assessment adverse event physiological response . Assuming emergent safety issue identify , next group 4 patient receive treatment 10 mL AeriSeal System Foam Sealant administer 8 subsegments , 3 upper lobe , one upper-most portion right middle lobe , one upper-most portion lingual ( dose 80 mL AeriSeal Foam Sealant ) . All patient follow 24 week completion therapy receive standard medical treatment addition treatment AeriSeal System .</detailed_description>
