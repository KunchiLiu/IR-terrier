	<brief_summary>This proposal aim provide objective , non-invasively achieve , physiologically relevant data order provide rational basis decision-making transfusion sTBI . Specifically proposal observational study transfusion brain tissue saturation sTBI patient . The result illustrate degree brain tissue oxygenation critically dependent degree anemia sTBI help decision whether transfusion might helpful .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Cerebral Tissue Oxygenation During Transfusion Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While study invasively monitor cerebral saturation brain tissue oxygen severe traumatic brain injury ( sTBI ) patient , none use non-invasive cerebral saturation monitoring TBI patient undergo packed red blood cell ( pRBC ) transfusion . To date , publish study involve invasive monitoring concomitant potential side effect . Insertion invasive probe monitor several risk side effect include bleeding , local trauma brain damage , infection . Furthermore , limited utility information restrict region brain surround probe , oppose global picture . We therefore propose observational study use non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy monitor brain tissue oxygen transfusion pack red blood cell . Primary Hypothesis : • Improved oxygen delivery cause improved brain tissue oxygen saturation . Testable Hypothesis : • The transfusion pack red blood cell result change hemoglobin 70- 100g/L range , associate increase cerebral tissue oxygen saturation measure near infrared spectroscopy severe traumatic brain injured patient . Primary Aims : • Evaluate applicability 4 wavelength near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) monitor cerebral oximetry traumatic brain injury patient . Observe trend cerebral tissue oxygenation saturation ( StO2 ) , blood transfusion TBI patient . Secondary Hypothesis : - We hypothesize pRBCs transfuse plateau ( i.e . hemoglobin threshold ) beyond increase cerebral tissue oxygenation occur . - There lag time increase systemic hemoglobin improvement cerebral tissue oxygenation . Secondary Aims : - To correlate systemic hemoglobin level cerebral tissue oxygenation saturation pRBCs transfuse . - Correlation non-invasive cerebral tissue oxygenation saturation measurement invasive brain tissue oxygen tension ( available ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; 18 year old 2 . Patient clinical diagnosis severe TBI GCS &lt; 9 3 . Patient require PRBC transfusion qualify Hb &lt; 10/dL 1 . Inability place NIRS probe patient ( facial fracture , facial laceration , etc. ) . 2 . Deficient signal SctO2 impede proper valuation 3 . Active coronary ischemia judge dynamic ischemic ECG change and/ positive troponin level due myocardial contusion . 4 . Active hemorrhage : Example 1 . Bleeding chest , abdomen retroperitoneum likely require surgery +/ embolization 2 . Pelvic fracture likely require surgery +/ embolization 3 . More two long bone fracture require operative fixation 5 . Clinical diagnosis drug alcohol intoxication predominant cause coma 6 . Systolic BP &lt; 90mmHg 7 . Heart rate &gt; 120bpm 8 .
