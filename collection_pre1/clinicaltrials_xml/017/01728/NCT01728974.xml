	<brief_summary>In obstructive sleep apnea , upper airway recurrently close sleep . The mechanisms lead airway closure completely understood . While airway people narrow airflow decrease inspiration due increase inspiratory effort , others maintain constant airflow throughout inspiration . Airway neuromuscular reflex may protect airway narrowing occurs due increase inspiratory effort . To test hypothesis , investigator initially measure airway neuromuscular reflex inspiratory flow attenuate neuromuscular reflex topical pharyngeal anesthesia observe effect inspiratory flow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mechanisms lead airway closure completely understood . While airway people narrow airflow decrease inspiration due increase inspiratory effort , others maintain constant airflow throughout inspiration ( negative effort dependence , NED ) . The investigator hypothesize upper airway neuromuscular reflex may protect narrow occurs due increase inspiratory effort . Topical oropharyngeal anesthesia show reduce neuromuscular reflex . Thus , investigator also hypothesize patient stable inspiratory flow develop NED reflex impair topical anesthetic . The investigator plan : 1. measure upper airway muscle EMG ass corresponds presence absence NED . This aim allow u test hypothesis robust upper airway muscle reflex protect NED . 2. reduce upper airway muscle activity reflexes topical oropharyngeal anesthesia . This allow u test hypothesis attenuate upper airway muscle activity induce topical anesthesia induce NED .</detailed_description>
