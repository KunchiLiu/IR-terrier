	<brief_summary>The VITamin D OmegA-3 TriaL ( VITAL ; NCT 01169259 ) ongoing randomize clinical trial 25,875 U.S. men woman investigate whether take daily dietary supplement vitamin D3 ( 2000 IU ) omega-3 fatty acid ( OmacorÂ® fish oil , 1 gram ) reduce risk develop cancer , heart disease , stroke people prior history illness . This ancillary study conduct among participant VITAL examine whether vitamin D fish oil improve respiratory symptom reduces risk lung infection reduce decline pulmonary function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LungVITamin D OmegA-3 Trial ( lungVITAL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) pneumonia lead cause death United States worldwide . COPD , also significant source disability , increase prevalence . Approximately 14 million adult asthma , lead approximately 12 million missed work day per year United States . In adult , COPD asthma often coexist . Treatment option COPD limit , prevalence vitamin D deficiency high . COPD lung disease ( COPD , asthma , airflow obstruction ) , COPD additional co-morbidities responsible COPD progression ( e.g. , respiratory infections/pneumonia , muscle weakness , cardiac failure ) may benefit vitamin D supplementation therapy , require rigorous test . Marine omega-3 fatty acid work different pathway vitamin D affect inflammation . Observational study clinical trial suggest consumption fish and/or fish oil may protect COPD , asthma pneumonia , data consistent . Thus , compel need clinical trial evaluate potential benefit risk vitamin D fish oil supplementation COPD asthma exacerbation , airflow obstruction decline lung function , risk pneumonia . The primary outcome interest Lung VITAL COPD/asthma exacerbation dyspnea ( shortness breath ) ; airflow obstruction decline pulmonary function ; pneumonia . Asthma control secondary outcome ; new-onset COPD asthma tertiary outcome . Lung VITAL conduct among 20,000 participant VITAL ( NCT 01169259 ) . Additionally , effect vitamin D fish oil supplementation level well rate decline lung function evaluate subset VITAL participant home visit clinic visit .</detailed_description>
