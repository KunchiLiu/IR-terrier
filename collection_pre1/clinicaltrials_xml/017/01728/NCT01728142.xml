	<brief_summary>The Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment ( DANA ) recently develop durable , portable , `` field-hardened '' NeuroCognitive Assessment Tool . The purpose study compare sensitivity DANA Brief exam Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics ( ANAM ) battery currently use military concussion . The primary hypothesis DANA Brief exam sensitive detect continue impaired cognitive performance ANAM recovery concussion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison DANA ANAM Evaluation Cognitive Changes After Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among active duty military personnel deploy combat theater , blast injury lead cause traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Service member TBI experience notable neurological impairments-e.g. , attention disturbance , memory language deficit , delay reaction time . Cognitive performance still impair 2-4 week concussion overt physical symptom . Thus , critical need efficient mean determine incidence cognitive deficit service member expose injured blast . To end , study plan evaluate ANAM DANA determine neurocognitive test reliably accurately detect cognitive impairment recovery period concussion .</detailed_description>
