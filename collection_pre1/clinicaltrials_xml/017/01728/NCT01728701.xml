	<brief_title>Controlled Human Malaria Infection ( CHMI ) After Immunization With Cryopreserved Plasmodium Falciparum Sporozoites Under Chloroquine Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single centre , double blind , randomize control clinical trial . Volunteers , investigator laboratory personnel blind . A maximum 30 volunteer randomly divide four group . All volunteer receive standard weekly chloroquine chemoprophylaxis period 14 week ( 98 day ) . During period , group 1 3 receive six ID injection PfSPZ Challenge , contain total 75,000 PfSPZ Pf NF54 strain , day 8 , 36 64 ( immunization 1 , 2 3 ) . The control group 2 4 receive ID injection normal saline ( NS ) day . Thirty-three day last dose chloroquine , volunteer group 1 2 control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) bite five mosquito infect PfSPZ Pf NF54 strain . If ≥75 % volunteer group 1 protect homologous Pf CHMI , volunteer group 3 4 CHMI bite five mosquito infect heterologous Pf NF135.C10 strain 75 day last dose chloroquine . If &lt; 75 % volunteer group 1 protect homologous Pf CHMI , volunteer group 3 4 receive additional immunization ( immunization 4 ) , consist six ID injection day 75,000 PfSPZ Challenge NS respectively , day 162 . In fourth immunization period chloroquine administer another 6 week start day 154 . Finally , 33 day last dose chloroquine , volunteer group 3 4 homologous Pf CHMI bite five PfSPZ-infected mosquito . After CHMI volunteer treat curative regimen Malarone® ( tablet contain 250 mg atovaquone 100 mg proguanil ) , either time detection blood stage parasitemia 21 day exposure PfSPZ-infected mosquito . Volunteers check parasite thick smear least twice treatment . If one volunteer fit participate study day -1 , alternate volunteer pass screen replace . For purpose 3 additional volunteer screen possible back .</detailed_description>
