	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose pomalidomide bortezomib give together dexamethasone treat patient amyloid light-chain amyloidosis light chain deposition disease . Biological therapy , pomalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop abnormal cell grow . Bortezomib may stop growth abnormal cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving pomalidomide bortezomib together dexamethasone may effective treatment amyloid light-chain amyloidosis light chain deposition disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-line Pomalidomide , Bortezomib , Dexamethasone For AL Amyloidosis LCDD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination pomalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone ( PVD ) take forward subsequent phase 2 study . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain preliminary assessment efficacy PVD regimen initial treatment amyloid light-chain ( AL ) light chain deposition disease ( LCDD ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pomalidomide bortezomib . Patients receive pomalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 ; bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 ; dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 3 month .</detailed_description>
