	<brief_summary>The purpose study see take nevirapine ( NVP ) HIV change way artemether/lumefantrine ( AL ) work child co-infected HIV malaria . The brand AL use study Coartem® Dispersible . This study compare blood level AL co-infected child already take NVP prescribe doctor co-infected child take anti HIV medicine meet national guideline start . The study also assess safety use medication ( AL NVP ) child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacology Antimalarial Therapy With Without Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria HIV among two important global health problem time . Malaria account 3 million death year , 90 % occur Africa malaria lead cause mortality young child . Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) mainstay antimalarial therapy throughout much world , yet pediatric pharmacokinetic data widely adopt ACT regimen , artemether/lumefantrine ( AL ) lack . Of equal importance assessment key drug-drug interaction HIV co-infected child ARVs know affect metabolic enzyme activity responsible ACT elimination . This study propose investigate drug-drug interaction antimalarial artemether/lumefantrine nevirapine base antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment HIV child co-infected resource limited setting .</detailed_description>

All sample test must whole blood , serum plasma . Subjects ≤ 18 month age The first test may follow : 1 . One HIV DNA Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) 2 . One HIV RNA ( quantitative &gt; 5,000 copies/mL qualitative ) 3 . One HIV culture ( prior August 2009 ) 4 . One total HIV nucleic acid If first test ( ) positive , second sample collect tested use test list ( except qualitative RNA assay ) laboratory participate appropriate external quality assurance program NIHapproved . Subjects &gt; 18 month age The first test may follow : 1 . Two rapid antibody test different manufacturer base different principle epitopes 2 . One rapid antibody test AND one [ enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) OR Western blot ( WB ) OR immunofluorescence OR chemiluminescence ] 3 . One EIA AND one [ WB OR immunofluorescence OR chemiluminescence ] 4 . One HIV DNA PCR 5 . One HIV RNA ( quantitative &gt; 5,000 copies/mL qualitative ) 6 . One HIV culture ( prior August 2009 ) 7 . One total HIV nucleic acid If first test ( ) positive , second sample collect tested use test list ( except qualitative RNA assay ) laboratory participate appropriate external quality assurance program either CAP/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) approve ( US laboratory ) NIHapproved ( international laboratory ) . Presentation malaria indicate positive smear malaria parasite along clinical evidence infection ( fever history fever past 24 hour ) plan treatment AL . Receiving : ( ) NO ARV drug least 4 week prior study entry intent initiate ARVs study duration , OR ( b ) NVPbased combination ARV therapy least 4 week prior study entry , intent continue duration study . NOTE : Subjects manage NVPbased ARV therapy time study enrollment continue NVPbased ARV therapy receive AL treatment . Children NOT meet eligibility ART accord national guideline ( base know available data time enrollment ) permit enroll study group child receive NO ARV drug . For study arm NO ARV drug , subject must receive ARV drug currently must ARV drug least 4 week prior entry . If subject already antimalarial medication time study entry , 3 dos either generic AL brand Coartem® ( either standard tablet dispersible formulation ) may give prior study entry . Subjects may receive first , second , and/or third dose different AL formulation study formulation Coartem® Dispersible . However , actual dose artemether lumefantrine administer MUST stipulate protocol .
