	<brief_summary>Single-agent gemcitabine currently still regard one international standard care patient advance pancreatic cancer ( Burris 1997 [ 4 ] ) . The oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib receive EMEA-approval treatment patient metastatic pancreatic cancer January 2007 . In pivotal phase III trial , combination gemcitabine plus erlotinib associate statistically significant prolongation OS ( compare single-agent gemcitabine ) , however , absolute survival benefit - overall study population - clinically moderate ( median OS : 6.24 v 5.91 month , 1-year OS rate : 23 % vs 17 % ; HR = 0.82 , p=0.038 ) ( Moore 2007 [ 19 ] ) . The recently present FOLFIRINOX regimen show enhanced activity metastatic pancreatic cancer patient . This regimen , however , limited patient good performance status ( ECOG 0-1 ) , major comorbidity , age &lt; 75 year , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 ULN ( Conroy 2011 [ 6 ] ) . The majority pancreatic cancer patient therefore treat regimen . Accordingly , novel treatment concept urgently need pancreatic cancer pre-clinical data indicate important role EGFR1/erbB2 receptor signal pathogenesis pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( Yeh 2007 [ 24 ] ) . A recent publication ( Larbouret 2010 [ 16 ] ) indicate combination cetuximab trastuzumab induce superior antitumour activity human pancreatic carcinoma xenograft compare gemcitabine alone ( see also Larbouret 2007 [ 15 ] ) . Furthermore , synergistic antitumour activity observe monoclonal antibody direct EGFR1 erbB2 combine ( Ben-Kasus 2009 [ 3 ] ) . Based data , good rationale investigate combine inhibition erbB family pancreatic cancer patient . Afatinib ( BIBW 2992 ) novel irreversible EGFR1- HER2 HER4 inhibitor apply orally . The purpose present trial investigate erbB family inhibition afatinib patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . In planned trial , afatinib apply dose ( 40 mg/day ) chosen randomise phase III trial ( LUX 5 study ) investigate afatinib plus weekly paclitaxel ( 80mg/m2 ) . Presently also phase I study ongoing investigates combination afatinib gemcitabine ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01251653 U10-2249-02 ) . Possibly data available study ready start . Otherwise modification regimen plan respective data available . In trial , integrate translational project may allow identification patient primarily benefit novel treatment approach . The availability tumour tissue- blood sample patient therefore important inclusion criterion . A 2:1 randomisation choose favour experimental arm since large body data available gemcitabine alone since sufficient efficacy toxicity data shall gain experimental arm . In addition , patient ' motivation take part trial greatly enhance great chance receive experimental agent .</brief_summary>
