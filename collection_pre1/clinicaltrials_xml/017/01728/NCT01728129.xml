	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare sensitivity DANA Rapid exam MACE cognitive score . The primary hypothesis DANA Rapid exam sensitive detecting impaired cognitive performance MACE cognitive score set clinical diagnosis concussion point injury combat set . A secondary purpose study examine serial performance DANA Rapid exam subject diagnose concussion . The secondary hypothesis DANA Rapid exam show improvement performance recovery period concussion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DANA Compared MACE Evaluation Suspected Acute Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Operations Iraqi Freedom Enduring Freedom ( OIF/OEF ) , 60 % combat casualty result explosive blast , many critical injury involve trauma head . As result , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) deem `` signature wound '' OIF OEF . The symptom head injury , particularly concussion/mild TBI ( mTBI ) , sever subtle , suggest early accurate diagnosis paramount wound warrior 's appropriate medical care . Most first provider war theater medic could benefit improved diagnostic test well identify service member concussion/mTBI . The MACE cognitive test heavily weight towards memory , 100 % specific , preclude diagnosis concussion render despite score normal range . Thus , objective test neurocognitive function , DANA Rapid , rapidly administer theater combat medic would highly beneficial accurate clinical diagnosis timely treatment . The result present study provide information predictive value newly develop DANA handheld computer assist diagnosis concussion service member blast expose . If DANA Rapid exam prove equally accurate MACE detect cognitive deficit , test handheld computer also contribute improve health care service member minimize time injury diagnosis .</detailed_description>
