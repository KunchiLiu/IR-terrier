	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study compare use deep standard neuromuscular blockade ( NMB ) combination low standard insufflation pressure participant undergo surgical procedure , laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Insufflation refers injection carbon dioxide abdomen laparoscopic surgery , allow visualization access surgical field . The primary hypothesis study use sustain deep NMB improve surgeon 's overall satisfaction surgical condition compare standard NMB . The in-patient surgery perform Day 1 participant remain hospitalize least 48 hour follow surgery ( least 24 hour follow surgery , local practice allow 48 hour hospitalization post surgery ) . On Day 8 , follow-up visit/contact include participant occurs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Use Deep Standard Neuromuscular Blockade Combination With Low Standard Insufflation Pressures Participants Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy ( P07982 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During procedure , surgeon ( blinded random assignment ) could request unblinded anesthetist change randomize treatment condition ( call `` rescue intervention '' ) , surgeon consider surgical condition unacceptable . This do systematically follow : If participant standard NMB , prefer rescue intervention increase NMB depth 1-2 PTCs ; participant second option ( participant also low insufflation pressure ) increase insufflation pressure 4 mmHg . If participant already deep NMB , preferred option ( participant also low insufflation pressure ) increase insufflation pressure 4 mmHg .</detailed_description>
