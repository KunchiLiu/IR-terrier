	<brief_summary>The Use sedative drug intensive care widespread . A cohort study conduct Australia New Zealand 2010 reveal high prevalence deep sedation within first 48 hour mechanical ventilation independently link prolonged ventilation , hospital 180 day mortality . Clinical practice move towards use light level sedation . Recent RCTs Europe ( JAMA 2012 ) previous RCTs ( JAMA 2009 ) support grow evidence dexmedetomidine facilitate rousable sedation , shorten ventilation time attenuate delirium compare midazolam propofol . The investigator confirm pilot study feasibility , efficacy safety process care know Early Goal Directed Sedation ( EGDS ) delivers : 1 . Early randomization intubation arrival ICU ( intubate ) . 2 . Early Adequate analgesia randomization . 3 . Goal direct sedation titrate achieve light sedation . 4 . Dexmedetomidine base algorithm primary sedative agent avoidance benzodiazepine . The aim study ass effectiveness Early Goal Directed Sedation compare standard care sedation critically ill patient . The study hypothesis Early Goal-Directed Sedation ( EGDS ) , compare standard care sedation , reduce 90-day all-cause mortality critically ill patient require mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Goal-Directed Sedation Compared With Standard Care Mechanically Ventilated Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This large-scale study effectiveness novel approach sedation ventilate critically ill patient . The primary aim study determine whether Early Goal Directed Sedation therapy , compare standard care sedation , reduce 90-day mortality critically ill patient ventilate &gt; 24 hr . The study randomize , unblinded , control trial conduct approximately 35-50 intensive care unit ( ICUs ) recruit 4000 mechanically ventilated patient ( life support ) expect remain ventilator &gt; 24 hour AND require immediate ongoing sedative medication comfort , safety , facilitate delivery life support measure , include mechanical ventilation . Patients primary brain injury prolong weakness exclude . Participants randomize one 2 study group . All patient receive adequate analgesia randomization discretion treat clinician . All randomized patient Light sedation default target unless otherwise clinically indicate . The intervention group receive EGDS dexmedetomidine primary sedative agent achieve light sedation , addition propofol require . The use benzodiazepines intervention group allow , exception specific , defined circumstance . The control group sedation accord usual practice choose treat clinician . The use dexmedetomidine allow , exception specific , defined circumstance . Deidentified data collect include; Baseline demographic information; Doses sedative , analgesic relate medications; Pain , sedation delirium score major treatment ventilation time , tracheostomy dialysis . Patients survive hospital discharge contact phone determine independent survival status 90 day 180 day plus Health Related Quality Life cognitive function assessment .</detailed_description>
