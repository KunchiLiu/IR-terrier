	<brief_summary>The goal study collect blood sample umbilical cord newborn baby , soon deliver , place sample MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank . Your sample may include National Cord Blood Inventory ( NCBI ) part CW Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program . The NCBI federally-supported program assist collection cord blood . Cord blood make available patient The National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) . These sample may offer MD Anderson institution patient need bone marrow transplant donor . The MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank right release cord blood unit institution around world accord establish bone marrow transplant donor criterion , fee cover cost . Cord blood sample collect meet clinical requirement patient use may also use MD Anderson institution either research quality purpose improve cord blood banking procedure . If suitable patient use research purpose , cord blood unit may throw away .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Collection Storage Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The blood unborn baby 's umbilical cord contain blood-making cell could help treat another person life-threatening disease . These cord blood cell may provide cell transplant give patient marrow disease leukemia . These cord blood transplant do patient 's cell type ( human leukocyte antigen , HLA , type ) match cord blood type . 'Cord blood ' normally throw away umbilical cord placenta baby bear . Collection cord blood take place new baby bear umbilical cord clamp cut normal way . The collection cord blood take place part cord still connect placenta , new baby . The cord blood may collect 'in-utero ' : baby deliver placenta still inside uterus , may collect 'ex-utero ' : placenta deliver . The choice method collection perform depend preference obstetrician/midwife . Neither method put baby risk injury . Once cord blood drawn , become property MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank , retain residual interest right sample . During delivery baby , obstetrician health newborn baby main concern . If agree take part study , doctor and/or Cord Blood Bank staff try collect cord blood , doctor 's main concern well baby . Circumstances may arise prevent collection cord blood . The cord blood collect take MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank Laboratory , test sent test laboratory accredit test describe . Just like donation blood transfusion , important cord blood carry infection pass . When volunteer donate blood blood bank , ask fill confidential questionnaire risk infection ( like acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) cause human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis , and/or malaria ) . You ask question like questionnaire . You also ask question family medical history , check chance inherited disease could pass cord blood . This questionnaire complete within 48 hour baby bear , take 15 minute complete . This questionnaire use screening purpose , may result cord blood suitable patient use , case cord blood may use research purpose , quality purpose ( improve cord blood banking procedure ) , discard . Your medical chart , infant , review help determine whether may disease could inherit thus transmit cord blood transplant patient receives . Additionally , ask family ethnic/racial background ; information use help match cord blood patient . A blood sample ( 2 tablespoonful ) drawn test infectious disease include HIV , human T cell Iymphotrophic virus ( HTLV ) , Hepatitis B C , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , West Nile Virus ( WNV ) , Trypanosoma cruzi ( T cruzi , parasitic organism cause Chagas disease ) syphilis . The cord blood unit may also test HIV , HTLV , Hepatitis B C , CMV , WNV , T. cruzi , syphilis , bacterial fungal infection , blood type ( ABO/Rh ) . This test perform accredited test laboratory . Small sample blood cord blood ( 2 teaspoonful ) also frozen store separately screen disease future . If deliver baby Texas , per Texas state law , blood sample take baby hospital staff send Department State Health Services test inherited disease , know 'Newborn Screening ' . You ask sign release form allow Department State Health Services release Newborn screening result MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank . Since disease may pass transplant , donate cord blood unit bank positive result receive . The Department State Health Services notify physician positive unclear Newborn screening result . In addition , cord blood unit sometimes maternal blood sample test HLA type use identify match transplant patient need cord blood . This test perform MD Anderson . A small sample cord blood unit send Stemcyte City Hope Laboratories California sophisticate type determine whether cord blood unit might useful treat AIDS patient . Both blood cord blood test infection , rare instance infection could find mother 's blood yet find cord blood . It also possible although uncommon , infection could find cord blood mother 's blood . If volume donate cord blood large enough banking , test may perform . All information provide , well identity new baby keep confidential possible , full extent allow law . While MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank maintain link cord blood unit information identifying , multiple level security protect . When information blood sample collect , give unique sample number . Nobody except Principal Investigator designate Principal Investigator access personal information . If cord blood release another institution transplant , way determine donor keep identity anonymous . If donate cord blood cell use transplant , recipient cord blood cell able access personal information . At time donation , ask provide MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank address physician . If unclear positive result find test blood cord blood ( HIV , HTLV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , WNV , Chagas and/or syphilis ) , MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank notify physician use information provide Cord Blood Bank . As require Texas law confirm positive unclear test HIV/AIDS syphilis blood cord blood report Texas Department State Health Services . Additionally , Houston Department Health Human Services notify positive West Nile Virus result , may contact conduct confidential interview help track community risk WNV . The Cord Blood Bank may also contact directly , use contact information provide , order obtain updated information child 's health regarding inherit disorder and/or communicable disease , request additional information clarification information contain Cord Blood Bank file . If become aware change baby 's health may affect suitability donate cord blood unit transplantation , important contact Cord Blood Bank 713-563-8000 . The cord blood test frozen . Cord blood unit meet clinical specification store MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank , listed stem cell donor registry may release MD Anderson institution US around world follow establish criterion bone marrow transplant donor , fee cover handling charge . These institution use cord blood patient need bone marrow transplant . Any fresh store cord blood unit donate Cord Blood Bank meet clinical specification ( example , small bacterial contamination ) , use patient need bone marrow transplant , may discard use research study improve cord blood banking procedure , either MD Anderson institution . Before cord blood use research , people research must get specific approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson IRB institution research perform . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . All research perform MD Anderson , include research involve cord blood bank , must first approve IRB . The cord blood unit use first come , first serve basis . At time donation , give address phone number MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank . In unlikely event another immediate family member develop disease would require use donate cord blood , may release basis would provide qualify patient , still control MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank already commit patient . You contact MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank within one month collection wish donate cord blood unit destroy . If request , research staff destroy cord blood unit use research , Cord Blood Bank validation study quality control . After one month period pass , cord blood unit make available patient use unable request destroy . This investigational study . Up 250,000 woman take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
