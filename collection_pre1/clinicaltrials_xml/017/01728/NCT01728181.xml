	<brief_summary>The current trial `` A Phase I/II study Erlotinib +/- Tivozanib initial treatment Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer assign VeriStrat® Serum Proteomic Evaluation '' begin evaluate toxicity combination Tivozanib Erlotinib determine phase II dose . The phase II portion study seek duplicate find BEER trial select population patient NSCLC VeriStrat® Good signature use two oral agent Tivozanib substitute bevacizumab . Phase II design selection-based randomized trial . Patients VeriStrat® Good signature assign EGFR inhibitor therapy randomization Erlotinib plus/minus Tivozanib . Patients VeriStrat® Poor signature assign standard care . Standard-of-care chemotherapy first treatment discretion patient physician evaluate response treatment , survival repeat VeriStrat® signature .</brief_summary>
