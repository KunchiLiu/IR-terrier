	<brief_summary>Malnutrition frequent problem critically ill patient associate detrimental clinical outcome . To provide adequate nutritional support , current study focus mostly choice delivery timing , formula selection route administration , little attention pay malnutrition relate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI ) . In fact , malnutrition also major consequence pancreatic exocrine insufficiency pancreatic damage commonly observe critically ill patient without prior pancreatic disease . Hence , EPI associate malnutrition concern due high prevalence pancreatic damage critically ill patient . The aim study evaluate incidence EPI critically ill adult patient explore potential risk factor . Moreover , efficacy pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy malnutrition ICU patient specific clinical characteristic investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency Pancreatic Enzyme Supplementation Critically Ill Adult Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critically ill patient able receive early enteral nutrition estimate stay ICU least four day consider enroll study . Exclusion criterion age 18 80 year , pregnancy breastfeeding , know exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due pancreatitis , unresectable pancreatic cancer , cystic fibrosis , celiac disease , Zollinger-Ellison syndrome , pancreatectomy , gastrectomy medication somatostatin aprotinin directly influence pancreatic exocrine function . Informed consent document sign immediate family member recruit patient . All study procedure perform accordance institutional guideline conduct research human being approve Human Ethics Committee Shanghai Tenth People 's Hospital . Once enrolled patient admit ICU , insert either nasogastric tube nasojejunal tube guide electronic gastroscope accord expect feeding time , position feed tube confirm plain abdominal radiograph . Enteral nutrition initiate rate 25 ml/h within 24h admission , infusion rate increase steadily prescribe nutritional requirement achieve within 3 day . Daily nutritional requirement calculate mainly base patient 's body mass index . During study , detail patient age , sex , BMI , admission diagnosis , Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation II score collect . All clinical characteristic may cause pancreatic damage , include shock ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg ) , tissue hypoxia ( serum lactate &gt; 2 mmol/L ) , respiratory failure ( PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg ) , anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L ) , obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) , biliary sludge ( total bilirubin &gt; 17.5 μmol/L ) , hypertriglyceridemia ( &gt; 1.7 mmol/L ) , sepsis , cardiac arrest , cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , severe head injury , acute stroke , post-neurosurgery , diabetes , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBS ) , mechanical ventilation continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) record prospectively . Medications propofol , valproate , metronidazole morphine-derived drug , apply 24 h might induce pancreatic damage , also document . Arterial blood sample take 3 day admission determine biochemical parameter . Stool sample collect 3-5 day begin enteral nutrition frozen -20℃ analysis . Some patient undergo CT scan magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography ( MRCP ) acquire histological evidence exocrine pancreatic insufficiency .</detailed_description>
