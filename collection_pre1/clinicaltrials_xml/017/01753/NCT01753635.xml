	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare performance Baska mask supraglottic airway device single use laryngeal mask device ( LMA ) low-risk female patient . The investigator perform number study novel airway device , include 3 study Baska mask . This trial compare performance characteristic study device , include airway seal pressure , insertion success rate , device use difficulty score . Additional performance device safety data accumulate . The investigator two primary hypothesis , namely 1.Non-inferiority first placement attempt success rate Baska mask v LMA ; 2.greater seal pressure Baska mask v LMA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Baska Mask Airway Single-use LMA Device Low-risk Female Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supraglottic airway device establish place airway management patient undergo general anesthesia . The Baska mask new supraglottic airway device . It 's feature include : 1 . Non pressurize cuff design reduce risk oropharyngeal tissue damage . 2 . Improved cuff seal inspiratory phase positive pressure ventilation 3 . An improved system drainage oropharyngeal content intend reduce rate lung aspiration . 4 . Integrated bite-block reduce risk patient bite block airway . This study randomize , single-blinded , controlled trial . The participant allocate two group , either Baska mask single use LMA primary airway management device . Clinical Research Ethics Committee approval obtain . Suitable participant recruit write informed consent . Standard anesthetic preassesment anesthesia provide . Consenting patient randomly allocate either 2 study group . Protocol airway size selection attempt placement follow . The investigator monitor number parameter , include time ease insertion , airway seal pressure , airway leak , complication related device use . Follow perform . The investigator two primary hypothesis : 1 . That Baska mask non-inferior LMA respect first placement attempt success rate . A great 15 % difference success rate consider clinically important difference disprove hypothesis . 2 . The Baska mask superior respect seal pressure . A 20 % high seal pressure Baska compare LMA device seal pressure consider clinically important difference . Interim analysis perform 75 patient recruit per group . This reasonable figure exceeds require prove disprove primary hypothesis regard seal pressure . The study stop stage non-inferiority hypothesis disproven P value &lt; 0.01 In addition investigator evaluate number secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
