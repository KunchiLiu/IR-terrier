	<brief_summary>Lung disease predominant cause morbidity mortality Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) 80 % death result directly indirectly pulmonary disease . Abnormal airway clearance cause retention mucus result frequent chest infection . Physiotherapists use different technique help clear mucus lung patient CF . Inhaled medication airway clearance technique ( ACTs ) central CF patient 's daily treatment often coordinate . Burden treatment common reason non-adherence patient group , streamline treatment timing seek optimize adherence whilst ensure efficacy often complex daily regimen inhale bronchodilator , nebulizer ACTs . A gap research exist optimal time Hypertonic Saline ( HTS ) ACT within daily regimen . A study show whether time HTS around ACT significant , well inform patient potentially allow flexibility around treatment regimen . Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) show good sensitivity abnormality lung function compare spirometry demonstrate treatment effect trial . LCI may suitable tool therefore , assess intervention strategy aim airways clearance CF . This study aim compare effect ACTs HTS inhalation versus ACTs HTS inhalation measure LCI . It randomize , crossover trial ACTs HTS inhalation compare ACTs HTS inhalation adult CF patient day 10-14 hospital admission treatment pulmonary exacerbation . Patients randomize receive 1 treatment session option first day reverse second day . The primary objective study compare change LCI ( measure lung function ) 90 minute post treatment ACTs HTS inhalation compare ACTs HTS inhalation adult CF patient . LCI ( lung clearance index ) ACT ( airway clearance technique ) HTS ( hypertonic saline )</brief_summary>
