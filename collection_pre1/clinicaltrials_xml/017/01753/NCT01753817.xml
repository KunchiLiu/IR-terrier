	<brief_title>Assessment Radial Artery Patency Following Catheterization With 7F Sheath</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Coronary catheterization commonly perform diagnostic therapeutic procedure . The procedure commonly perform via transfemoral approach ( via femoral artery ) . Recently transradial approach ( via radial artery ) gain popularity since associate decrease risk bleed facilitates patient mobilization follow procedure ( 1-3 ) . During catheterization procedure sheath ( tube ) insert access artery enable insertion catheter device body . Vascular sheath may different internal diameter , measure French ( F ) unit . Commonly use sheath size coronary catheterization 5F 6F , however use large 7F sheaths beneficial complex procedure perform insertion two coronary stent . Use 7F sheath creates slightly large orifice within blood vessel wall may potentially increase risk damage vessel wall hemorrhage . The palm hand normally receive dual blood supply via radial ulnar artery . Prior perform transradial catheterization ability ulnar artery supply blood whole palm confirm perform Allen Test , order avoid palmar ischemia radial artery become occlude following procedure . Radial artery occlusion presence normal pre-procedural Allen Test almost universally asymptomatic , however may preclude future use radial artery vascular access coronary graft bypass surgery perform . The frequency radial artery occlusion follow transradial catheterization range 5 % 15 % different report ( 4 ) , depend many factor patient selection , degree anticoagulation procedure time interval performance procedure study radial artery patency . Use large sheath also report risk factor radial artery occlusion ( 5 ) , however true incidence complication unclear . It desirable discover true rate radial artery occlusion follow catheterization 7F sheath , since knowledge may assist physician plan optimal catheterization strategy . Aims : The aim study examine occurrence radial artery occlusion follow transradial catheterization 7F sheath . Hypothesis : Radial artery occlusion follow 7F catheterization rare occur &lt; 5 % case . Methods : The study perform part Mr. Dan Levin 's required Medical School Thesis research Faculty Medicine , Technion IIT , Haifa , Israel . Two-hundred subject previously undergo transradial catheterization year 1999 2012 7F sheath identify Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center Catheterization laboratory computerized database . The subject contact study investigator invite meeting investigator Carmel Medical Center . The study protocol consist single meeting investigator study subject . During meet subject give explanation study protocol . If consent participate study sign inform consent form , undergo physical examination reverse Allen test ultrasound examination patency radial artery . Radial artery patency study reverse Allen test . This test perform simultaneously occlude radial ulnar artery pulse signal detect pulse oximeter place index finger . The pressure radial artery release reappearance pulse signal oximeter documented-signifying antegrade flow radial artery . This test associate report complication morbidity . Radial artery flow study Doppler ultrasound . The ultrasound test perform Dr Salim Adawi cost . The ultrasound test routine non-invasive study associate report complication morbidity . Clinical procedural data collect CRF form order characterize risk factor radial artery occlusion . Endpoints : 1 . Normal reverse Allen test . 2 . Antegrade flow radial artery ultrasound . Number participant : The Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center catheterization laboratory database scan order identify patient undergone transradial catheterization 7F sheath . Two-hundred patient , men woman , recruit study . Inclusion exclusion criterion : Two-hundred Hebrew-speaking subject ( male female ) previously undergone 7F transradial cardiac catheterization Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center 1999 2012 contact . Upon give informed consent recruit study . Statistical analysis Univariate multivariate analysis perform order identify demographic , clinical procedural characteristic associate radial artery occlusion . References 1 . Amoroso et al .
