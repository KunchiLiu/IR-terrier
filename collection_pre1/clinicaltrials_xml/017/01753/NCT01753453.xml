	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate tumor cell mobilization ( TCM ) non-pegylated G-CSF alone compare non-pegylated G-CSF plus plerixafor patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) potentially poor mobilizers hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) . Second objective evaluate survival disease status G-CSF alone compare GCSF plus plerixafor , efficacy safety G-CSF plus plerixafor use mobilize stem cell autologous transplantation .</brief_summary>
