	<brief_summary>The primary goal propose clinical trial investigate combine effect walk train monoaminergic agent ( SSRIs TIZ ) motor function individual sub-acute ( 2-7 mo ) human motor incomplete Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) , primary emphasis improvement locomotor capability . We hypothesize use drug apply early following SCI may facilitate independent step ability , combination intensive step training result improve locomotor recovery follow incomplete SCI . Loss descend control via norepinephrine input follow spinal cord injury impair normal sensorimotor function depress motor excitability impair walk capacity . Replacing input drug alter excitability assist reorganization locomotor circuit . Assessment single-dose administration agent test patient motor incomplete spinal cord injury ; limit change walk performance note . The resultant onset weakness increase involuntary reflex follow motor incomplete SCI may partly result damage descend pathway spinal cord control release serotonin . In model SCI , example , application agent simulate serotonin show change voluntary motor behavior , include improvement walking recovery . In human follow neurological injury , effect 5HT agent unclear . Few previous report indicate improve motor function follow administration agent enhance available serotonin brain , although data suggests increase serotonin may beneficial . In application , propose study effect clinically use agent increase decrease intrinsic serotonin activity brain strength walk ability follow human motor incomplete SCI . Using detailed electrophysiological recording , biomechanical behavioral measure , determine effect single chronic dos drug voluntary involuntary motor behavior clinical measure walk measure . The novelty propose research expectation agent increase serotonin activity may increase abnormal reflex SCI , simultaneously help facilitate motor walk recovery . Despite potential improvement voluntary function , use pharmacological agent may enhance spastic motor behavior follow SCI mark contrast way drug typically use clinical setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I double blind randomize control clinical trial . The procedure participation Aims study describe chronological order . Aim 1 2 : Explanation consent form study procedures/protocol perform Neurolocomotion laboratory ( room 1382 ) , subject family provide ample time question . Subjects provide substantial time choose participate , provide laboratory phone numbers/emails contact PI research personnel potential question . In situation subject unable transported laboratory , PI explain consent form time location convenient subject and/or family . Subjects undergo screening procedure determine eligible participate study base inclusion/exclusion criterion . Aim 1 : Modified Ashworth scale ( mod Ash , unit ) use detect velocity-dependent resistance passive muscle stretch/joint rotation . The modAsh grossly assess spasticity bilateral knee extensor knee flexor , score 0-5 ( 1+ score convert 2 high score increase accordingly ) . Spinal Cord Assessment Tools Spasticity ( SCATS , unit ) employ assess flexor extensor spasms clonic activity plantarflexors ( Benz et al . , 2005 ) . Independence walk ability assess assessment period use Walking Index SCI II ( WISCI II , 21 point ( 0-20 ) ordinal scale assigns score base amount physical assistance , bracing , assistive device use ambulate . Notably , subject allow ambulate brace extend knee . Six minute walk test ( ) ass walk around continuous hall-way subject ' self-selected velocity , distance determine minute sum entire six minute duration ( van Hedel et al . , 2005 ) . Subjects ask `` walk ( ) normal , comfortable pace '' minimal physical assistance bracing/devices need This measure significantly association measure community walk subject incomplete SCI ( Saraf et al . , 2009 ) . BERG balance test administer . Gait Mat test perform guage spatiotemporal aspect walk . 6 minute walk test perform . Lower Extremity Motor Score , Peak treadmill speed ( m/s ) Aim 2 : Same include strength evaluation : Ankle , knee , hip flexors/extensors test bilaterally ( Biodex® ) . Subjects Aim 2 test initial evaluation , four week initial training , repeat four week train either placebo study medication . Subjects Aim 2 additionally request return follow test one year . Subjects offer participate audio , videotape and/or photography . Women childbearing age contemplate become pregnant require submit pregnancy test must notify principal investigator immediately .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A ) Subjects motor incomplete SCI ( AIS C D ) 19 mo . duration select , anatomical lesion C1T10 . B ) Subjects 18 75 year age . Note : grant application state 1675 , however , include subject 1875 . C ) All subject must previously ambulatory passive range motion consistent normal walking , must include : ankle dorsiflexion ankle 10° plantarflexion 30° , knee flexion 0 90° , hip flexion/extension 90° 10° . D ) Subjects medically stable medical clearance participate , absence concurrent severe medical illness , include unhealed decubiti , exist infection , significant cardiovascular metabolic disease limit exercise participation , significant osteoporosis ( indicated history fracture follow injury ) , active heterotrophic ossification low extremity , know history peripheral nerve injury lower leg , history know traumatic head injury , history pulmonary complication , include significant obstructive and/or restrictive lung disease . E ) Individuals undergoing concurrent physical therapy exclude study population , secondary use crossover design . Physical therapy record obtain ascertain amount type physical therapy service provide . F ) Women childbearing potential exclude , although woman pregnant consider become pregnant exclude due trunk pelvis restraint require use locomotion , secondary unknown effect pharmacological agent develop fetus . G ) Patients know liver , renal , metabolic disease may interfere drug action and/or clearance exclude propose study . These complication partially obviate require patient undergo specific medical procedure ( liver function test , urinalysis ) prior admission . H ) Men woman recruit participation propose clinical trial rate consistent national local average gender disparity SCI ( 80 % male , 20 % woman ) . Women childbearing potential exclude , although woman pregnant consider become pregnant exclude due trunk pelvis restraint require use locomotion , secondary unknown effect test agent ( SSRIs ) develop fetus . Women use oral contraceptive assess TIZ experiment exclude Aim 1 . I ) Individuals different ethnicity recruit rate similar national local ethnicity rate . Current data since 2005 indicate entire population SCI , 66.1 % Caucasian , 27.1 % African American , 6.6 % Hispanic origin , 2.0 % Asian . These population closely resemble RIC previous study human SCI . A ) Subjects ventilatordependent exclude secondary severely impaired respiratory capacity . B ) Subjects substantial orthopedic bracing stabilize cervical thoracic vertebral column unable fit safety harness without increase risk injury eligible . C ) Patients also exclude unable tolerate 10 minute stand without orthostasis ( decrease blood pressure 20 mmHg systolic 10 mmHg diastolic ) ; previous experience subacute population suggest 10 minute stand sufficient tolerate 45 minute walk secondary increase activity/muscle pump minimize risk orthostasis . D ) Women pregnant consider become pregnant exclude due trunk pelvis restraint require use locomotion , secondary unknown effect pharmacological agent develop fetus . E ) Subjects height weight limitation restrict participation Lokomat Training ( LT ) exclude . For height , subject &gt; 78 inch &lt; 60 inch tall may present thigh/shank length may limit use Lokomat . If subject able step independently treadmill require use roboticassistance treadmill step , attempt fit subject robotic orthosis prior enrollment randomization .
