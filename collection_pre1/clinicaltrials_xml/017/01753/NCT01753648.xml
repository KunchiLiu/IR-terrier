	<brief_summary>Recently , new sophisticated method assessment retinal blood flow retinal blood flow velocity profile become available . This technique base combination measurement retinal vessel caliber bidirectional Fourier domain optical coherence tomography ( FDOCT ) . The valid measurement retinal blood flow significant importance , know major ophthalmic disease , hypertensive retinopathy , associate alteration blood flow . Hypertensive retinopathy common manifestation arterial hypertension eye . Elevated systemic blood pressure lead generalize arteriolar narrowing cause vasospasms increase vascular tone . Further disease process , focal arteriolar narrowing , retinal haemorrhage , hard exudate cotton wool spot occur . Previous study show blood flow extraocular vessel choroid compromised patient arterial hypertension . However , data impact arterial hypertension retinal blood flow retinal blood flow velocity lack . The present study set compare total retinal blood flow retinal velocity profile patient hypertensive retinopathy healthy age- sex-matched control . Ocular perfusion pressure calculate base measurement blood pressure intraocular pressure allow calculation vascular resistance . In addition , velocity profile arterio-venous crossing measure . It hypothesize velocity profile considerably modify patient stage 2 3 hypertensive retinopathy compare healthy control pronounce arterio-venous compression .</brief_summary>
