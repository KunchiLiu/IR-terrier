	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Treatment Occipital Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 100 million patient United States suffer chronic pain . Chronic pain condition often debilitate , take toll patient 's physical mental welfare . Though variety pain management technique currently exist , common nonsurgical option provide slow-acting and/or short-term relief . Medication , often form non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) opioids , come array side effect nausea vomit . Medication also present possibility serious effect increase risk heart attack stroke , tolerance dependency issue . Surgical strategy tend reserve severe case limited risk complication typically associate surgery include bleeding , bruising , scar , infection . A nonsurgical , minimally invasive , long-lasting approach chronic pain management desirable . Myoscience , Inc. ( Redwood City , CA ) develop pain management device - Cryo-Touch III - novel , minimally invasive procedure use focused cold therapy target sensory nerve tissue offer long-lasting pain relief cryoanalgesia . The device operate well-established cryobiology principle localize exposure control , moderately low temperature condition alter tissue function . The therapy treat nerve via probe form assembly small diameter needle , create highly localize , low temperature treatment zone around probe . This focused cold therapy create conduction block prevents nerve signal . Prior study Cryo-Touch , Cryo-Touch II , Cryo-Touch III ( a.k.a . PCP 1.0 ) device provide preliminary evidence effectiveness motor nerve show safe serious device-related adverse event . Though study prove efficacious target motor nerve , device 's effect sensory nerve yet investigate clinical setting . The goal study describe herein evaluate degree duration effect Cryo-Touch III reduce chronic pain target sensory nerve .</detailed_description>
