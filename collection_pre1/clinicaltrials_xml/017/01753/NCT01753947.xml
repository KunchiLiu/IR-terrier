	<brief_summary>Training simulated model surgical skill laboratory show improve technical performance operating room . Currently describe simulation-based curriculum consist trainee practice task expert proficiency reach . It yet investigate whether individualized deliberate practice , curriculum task vary depend prior level technical proficiency , would translate operating room . This randomize controlled trial effectively demonstrate deliberate practice virtual reality simulator result improvement technical skill real clinical situation . This enhance feasibility implement simulation-based curriculum residency training program , consequently potential improve patient safety .</brief_summary>
