	<brief_summary>The goal study examine possible underlying cause sleep apnea ( disorder problem breathe sleep ) World Trade Center Responders . The study look relationship sleep apnea various nose throat condition . Specifically , study look upper airway disease ( problem nose throat ) , nasal inflammation , nasal resistance ( amount airflow nose ) . Subjects physical exam answer question nasal symptom sleep problem . Nasal lavage ( wash inner nasal passage ) perform subject marker inflammation measure lavage fluid . Rhinomanometry ( measure airflow nose ) also perform measure degree airflow obstruction . All subject ask perform in-home sleep apnea monitoring . Those subject diagnose sleep apnea test two treatment method . Sleep apnea treat use CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) device . This device blow air mask worn patient sleep . The two treatment method test fixed pressure CPAP ( pressure constant use ) CPAP-flex ( pressure decrease subject exhales ) . Patients randomly assign one treatment method one month cross treatment method next month . The investigator determine patient certain nasal condition ( high nasal resistance ) likely use CPAP-flex rather CPAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following World Trade Center ( WTC ) disaster , estimate 40,000 individual expose significant amount dust work rescue , recovery debris removal . A significant number responder report least one new worsen upper airway respiratory symptom examine 2004 50 % responder continue symptom chronic rhino-sinusitis upper airway disease ( UAD ) 2007 . In addition , 50 % UAD refer sleep center report new onset snoring questionnaire immediately follow exposure unusually high prevalence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) appear relate obesity , usual risk factor OSA . This suggest u mechanisms obesity may important pathogenesis OSA subject . Given chronic nasal symptom also provide unique opportunity examine relationship nasal pathology OSA test nasal symptom report subject WTC Health Program ( WTCHP ) indicator increase nasal resistance due nasal inflammation result exposure WTC dust . Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) standard therapy OSA despite efficacy poor adherence . Subjects high nasal resistance ( responder UAD OSA ) may experience additional pressure expiration upper airway result great difficulty tolerate CPAP therapy high nasal resistance . Reduction excess expiratory positive pressure modality know Cflexâ„¢ CPAP therapy ( CPAPFlex ) may improve comfort adherence subject without compromise CPAP efficacy .
