	<brief_summary>Currently , way doctor close skin cesarean section different surgeon little evidence support use one kind closure . At Mayo Clinic Family Birth Center , skin currently close use absorbable suture ( stitch ) , place within top layer skin . At institution , metal staple often use close skin . There new technique use special absorbable staple beneath skin . This technology may equal , possibly well , current skin closure technique . However , currently little data show compare . The purpose study compare absorbable staple currently use absorbable suture . The data study use help determine best technique skin closure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Subcuticular Staples Versus Subcuticular Suture Cesarean Section Skin Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean section one frequently perform surgical procedure worldwide . In United States , proportion delivery cesarean increase approximately 21 % 1996 32.8 % 2010 . Ultimately , rise incidence cesarean delivery result increase surgical morbidity ; include pain , blood loss , surgical site infection , lead increase overall hospitalization day healthcare cost . This volume surgical procedure also carry risk blood body fluid exposures surgical staff . Suture needle contribute 43.4 % sharps injury surgical setting 51.5 % sharp injuries surgeon alone . Additionally , discover 20 % blood borne pathogen exposure Mayo Clinic Rochester campus 2011 occur Department Obstetrics Gynecology . Therefore , quality improvement measure regard cesarean section potential significantly impact overall surgical morbidity , bloodborne pathogen exposure , healthcare cost institution . Reviews current literature show lack evidence many surgical step cesarean procedure . Thus , urgent need define evidence-based surgical technique step , incision closure . The optimal skin closure technique simple , quick , cost-effective , provide adequate tissue approximation good cosmetic outcome minimize risk infection , dehiscence , pain . Ideally , needlestick injury would also eliminate . It currently unknown skin closure method superior regard outcome . The INSORB 20 ( Incisive Surgical ) new , single-use device skin closure aim combine speed staple cosmetic outcome subcuticular suture , eliminate need staple removal . Additionally , reduce incidence needlestick injury . INSORB also claim result `` low maintenance wound '' le surgical site infection , low inflammation , increase patient comfort satisfaction . However , data limit compare INSORB current standard care ( either staple suture ) . The purpose study determine new absorbable subcuticular staple ( INSORB ) improve outcomes compare current standard absorbable subcuticular suture skin closure cesarean section .</detailed_description>
