	<brief_title>Dovitinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : Arm 1 : To determine 6 month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) anti-angiogenic therapy ( include anti-VEGF therapy bevacizumab ) naive patient recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) patient treat dovitinib Arm 2 : To estimate time progression patient recurrent progressive Glioblastoma progress anti-angiogenic therapy ( include anti-VEGF therapy ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To evaluate side effect profile dovitinib patient population . 2 . To evaluate efficacy dovitinib measure objective response rate ( ORR ) patient population . 3 . To estimate time percentage patient free progression 6 month ( PFS-6 ) patient recurrent progressive Glioblastoma progress antiangiogenic therapy ( include anti-VEGF therapy ) . 4 . To estimate time progression anti-angiogenic therapy ( include anti-VEGF therapy bevacizumab ) naiVe patient recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) patient treat dovitinib , 5 . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient population . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : To explore association clinical outcome potential biomarkers may include microparticles , PlGF , PDGF-AA , PDGF-AB , PDGF-BB , SDF-1a , thrombospondin-1 , Ang1 , Il-6 , IL-8 FGF . OUTLINE : Patients receive dovitinib orally ( PO ) 5 day week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
