	<brief_title>Surgical Blood Management Using Noninvasive Continuous Hemoglobin Monitoring ( NACHO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood transfusion associate various risk include viral infection , delay wound healing , transfusion relate acute lung injury cardiovascular complication . Despite limitation , ongoing effort identify validate more-physiologically-relevant `` trigger '' blood transfusion , hemoglobin-based transfusion trigger still commonly used practice , well currently available transfusion guideline , alone , combination parameter . In operating room anesthesiologist withdraw blood patient send lab blood gas machine achieve hemoglobin level . It may suggest ability continuously monitor hemoglobin level may help physician take appropriate transfusion decision ; i.e , physicians either identify critical decrease hemoglobin level earlier respond appropriately avoid over-transfusing hemoglobin level decrease yet . Accordingly , monitor hemoglobin level use operate theatre many center , although blood-conserving effect proven yet . We believe transfusion decision make algorithm operating room rely less heavily `` spot '' measure hemoglobin level rather patient 's comorbidities , expect additional bleeding accord surgery surgeon , course operation ( operate field `` open '' thus surgeon tell ooze frank bleeding , control bleed promptly etc.. ) , hemodynamic data available different invasive non-invasive monitor , pressure surgeon , etc . It therefore suggest continuous monitoring hemoglobin level may less relevant environment . Specific Aims/Hypothesis : 1 . The primary hypothesis continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring reduce number blood transfusion patient undergo surgery associate significant risk bleeding . 2 . The secondary hypothesis patient monitor continuous noninvasive hemoglobin , earlier warn critical drop hemoglobin , result less frequent complication compare patient monitor continuous noninvasive hemoglobin .</detailed_description>
