	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer ( PC ) lethal major cancer five year survival rate 5 % . While stage I II tumor lead improvement survival , almost PCs currently diagnose advanced non-resectable stage since minimally invasive technique capable screen early-stage PC exist . Serum CA19-9 recommend screen technique low sensitivity specificity . Imaging modality MRI , CT , EUS ERCP accurate appropriate screening tool due high cost , discomfort complication . Therefore , strong demand screen tool high sensitivity specificity highly acceptable patient . The investigator would like look spectroscopy technique pancreatic cancer diagnosis via upper endoscopy . A definite diagnosis patient make histology , cytology image diagnosis . Therefore study position feasibility study .</detailed_description>
