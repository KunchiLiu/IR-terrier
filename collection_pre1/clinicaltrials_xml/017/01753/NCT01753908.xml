	<brief_title>Broccoli Sprout Extract Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether isothiocyanate-rich broccoli sprout extract ( ITC-BSE ) modify biomarkers breast tumor cell . II . To determine whether intervention alters proliferative apoptotic marker ( Ki-67 cleave caspase-3 ) . III . To determine whether intervention down-regulates expression estrogen receptor ( ER ) include ERalpha ERbeta . IV . To determine whether intervention induces NAD ( P ) H dehydrogenase ( quinone ) 1 ( NQO1 ) expression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerability ITC-BSE compliance breast cancer patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive broccoli sprout extract orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 immediately prior surgery . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-14 immediately prior surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
