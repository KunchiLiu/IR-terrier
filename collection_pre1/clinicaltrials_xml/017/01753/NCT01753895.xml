	<detailed_description>Despite clear guideline manual blood pressure technique , seem large inter-observer variation , among nursing staff physician . These difference complicate variable cuff selection application , incorrect cuff position rapid cuff deflation rate , inadequate rest period , lack repeat measurement . The blood pressure measurement obtain automated device dependent observer training competency manual mercury device , yet use require careful patient evaluation caffeine nicotine use , cuff position , proper wrist positioning , instruct individual move talk accurate blood pressure obtain . If one performs automate reading manual blood pressure measurement standardized condition , mean value quite similar ; however , possibility yet fully test . Therefore , need assess systematically fact difference two blood pressure monitoring approach control condition . The goal study , , examine current practice obtain manual blood pressure measurement use mercury sphygmomanometer compare automate wrist-mounted blood pressure device . A possible implication study blood pressure measurement use automate blood pressure device comparable measurement obtain use mercury sphygmomanometer , mercury device replace environmentally acceptable automated device clinical research setting .</detailed_description>
