	<brief_summary>It report various epidemiological study patient moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis , without associate psoriatic arthritis , increase frequency cardiovascular risk factor , hypertension , obesity , type-2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . The presence endothelial dysfunction early stage , especially moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis form , could explain high prevalence cardiovascular disease mortality observe population . Existing evidence show improvement psoriasis correct factor , obesity hypercholesterolemia , reduction certain surrogate marker cardiovascular risk different modality psoriasis treatment suggest biological interaction two disease beyond mere epidemiological association . Recently publish result support hypothesis suggest link psoriasis cardiovascular disease could existence inflammatory state different organ , include skin , joint , adipose hepatic tissue , vascular endothelium ( 16 ) . Patients MetS increase risk develop T2DM cardiovascular disease . This syndrome characterize association adipose tissue inflammatory state diminish sensitivity insulin . In recent year , new mechanism participate development MetS add : Wnt signal pathway . Polymorphisms gene Wnt signal pathway associate metabolic abnormality predispose cardiovascular disease , development moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis , without associate psoriatic arthritis , response treatment anti-TNF-alpha . This study aim describe cardiovascular risk factor Spanish population patient moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis , without associate psoriatic arthritis , treat anti-TNF routine clinical practice condition . Possible difference efficacy relative presence absence criterion metabolic syndrome analyze . Similarly , explore role marker inflammatory activity genetic polymorphism Wnt pathway predict response treatment first year .</brief_summary>
