	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational melanoma vaccine . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational vaccine , case WDVAX , use study . `` Investigational '' mean vaccine still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA yet approve WDVAX use patient , include people Melanoma . The purpose study determine possible make vaccine melanoma use melanoma tumor cell combine protein activate immune system . We hope combine cell proteins way vaccine cause immune system react melanoma tumor cell . The purpose study also determine safe way give vaccine least amount side effect . Each vaccine contain tumor cell kill freeze thaw process destroy cell keep protein melanoma cell . This call `` tumor lysate '' Your tumor lysate combine protein activate immune system . The protein call GM-CSF CpG . All hold together form `` tablet '' `` scaffold '' size regular aspirin tablet . The material hold protein together call PLGA . PLGA material doctor use `` dissolvable stitch '' If ever problem type stitch past , sure let study doctor know .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After agree participate ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These procedure include : medical history , physical examination , performance status , assessment tumor blood test . If test show eligible participate research study , refer study surgeon prepare surgical removal tumor tissue vaccine make . If , time surgery , surgeon able obtain enough tumor cell u make vaccine , eligible participate research study . The surgery perform Brigham Women 's Hospital . The total number vaccine administer participant four . Since look short amount time dose administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant melanoma , everyone participates research study dose schedule receive vaccine . For example , participant receive vaccine month 4 dos , next group receive vaccine every three week 4 dos final group receive vaccine every two week four dos . The schedule vaccination depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . Before vaccination 24 hour vaccination physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . We assess tumor CT scan and/or MRI start vaccine , approximately half-way vaccine schedule one month completion four vaccine . After assess tumor every three month . We monitor side effect vaccine throughout vaccine administration one month follow completion vaccination side effect go . We assess tumor half-way vaccine administration , one month three month complete four vaccination every three month . We also continue follow collect information regard therapy receive vaccination complete keep track response might therapies future . Further , would like keep track medical condition rest life . We would like call telephone year see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long term effect research study . Because different group participant receive vaccination different time ( depend enrol ) , provide calendar specific schedule vaccine administration clinic visit test . The over-all schedule research study plan describe . If completion screening still eligible tumor collection surgery successful three week time period recover surgery u make vaccine laboratory DFCI . As described receive total four vaccination . On day receive vaccination , first undergo blood test , brief physical exam update medical record . If still eligible ot proceed , one study surgeon implant vaccine first wash small area arm , leg torso sterilize soap . Then make small incision skin create small `` pocket '' teh upper layer skin tissue underneath . Using sterile surgical tool slide vaccine `` tablet '' pocket use 2-3 stitch close incision . This site cover sterile bandage surgeon ask return follow day one study team member may check vaccine site . Depending enrol study , receive vaccine either ; every 4 week , every 3 week every 2 week total 4 vaccine . We able tell schedule time enrol study . We able give copy study calendar laboratory process tumor sample . If enough tumor cell leave vaccine preparation , irradiate kill give injection skin time first vaccination last vaccination . This injection give site different vaccination place . This call `` DTH test '' one way help u monitor activity immune system . If receive DTH test , perform small skin biopsy call `` punch biopsy '' DTH injection site 3-5 day follow second DTH injection ( 3-5 day follow last vaccination ) . If see vaccine injection site reaction ( redness , swell , etc . ) vaccination site also perform punch biopsy vaccination site 3-5 day follow vaccination Number 2 Number 4 . If time course vaccination complete four vaccination easily accessible tumor show sign inflammatory reaction vaccine may also biopsy tumor . The purpose u learn sort cell immune system may become activated tumor ar receive vaccine follow vaccination .</detailed_description>
