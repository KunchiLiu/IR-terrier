	<brief_summary>Rationale : Surgery remain standard care stage 1 ( T1-2a N0 ) non-small cell lung cancer . Stereotactic body radiation therapy new radiation treatment give few high possibly effective dos radiation standard radiation . This technique may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know whether stereotactic body radiation therapy effective surgery treat non-small cell lung cancer . Purpose : The primary aim randomize phase II trial determine efficacy SBRT comparable standard surgical intervention patient T1N0 non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically ( histologically cytologically ) proven diagnosis Stage I NSCLC ( AJCC , 7th ed . ) , T1N0M0 ; note : T1N0 disease must confirm FDGPET/CT The following primary cancer type eligible : squamous cell carcinoma ; adenocarcinoma ; large cell carcinoma/ large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma ; nonsmall cell carcinoma otherwise specify . Patients hilar mediastinal lymph node ≤ 1 cm abnormal hilar mediastinal uptake PET CT consider N0 . Mediastinal lymph node biopsy require patient visible node : patient &gt; 1 cm hilar mediastinal lymph node CT node appear abnormal PET ( include suspicious nondiagnostic uptake ) . Such patient eligible unless directed biopsy abnormal lymph node negative cancer node demonstrate lack change prior 6 month thus consider nonmalignant . The patient must consider reasonable candidate surgical resection use lobectomy pneumonectomy primary tumor within 6 week prior registration , accord follow criterion base American College Chest Physicians guideline [ 165 ] : A qualified thoracic surgeon make determination would high likelihood negative surgical margin ; Baseline FEV1 &gt; 60 % predict , postoperative predict FEV1 &gt; 40 % predict ; Diffusion capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) &gt; 60 % predict , postoperative predict DLCO &gt; 40 % predict ; No baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia ; If estimate postoperative FEV1 DLCO &lt; 40 % predicted indicates increase risk perioperative complication , include death , standard lung cancer resection ( lobectomy great removal lung tissue ) , cardiopulmonary exercise test measure maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) must &gt; 60 % ; No severe pulmonary hypertension ; No severe cerebral , acute chronic cardiac , peripheral vascular disease ; Pleural effusion , present , must deem small tap CT guidance must evident chest xray . Pleural effusion appear chest xray permit evidence malignancy invasive cytologic assessment . Appropriate stage protocol entry , include distant metastasis , base upon follow minimum diagnostic workup : History/physical examination , include documentation weight within 6 week prior registration ; ; Evaluation experience thoracic surgeon within 6 week prior registration ; FDGPET/CT scan stag RT plan within 4 week prior registration ; CT scan ( preferably intravenous contrast , unless medically contraindicate ) within 4 week prior registration include entirety lung , mediastinum , liver , adrenal gland ; primary tumor dimension measure CT scan . Zubrod Performance Status 01 within 6 week prior registration ; Age ≥ 18 ; For woman childbearing potential , serum urine pregnancy test must negative within 72 hour prior registration ; Women childbearing potential male participant sexually active must practice adequate contraception treatment assign treatment SBRT . Patients must provide study specific informed consent prior study entry . Direct evidence regional distant metastasis PET surgical staging study , synchronous primary malignancy prior invasive malignancy past 3 year , follow exception : carcinoma situ ; early stage skin cancer definitively treat ; invasive malignancy treat definitively patient remain disease free ≥ 3 year ; Primary tumor &gt; 3 cm ; Prior systemic chemotherapy thoracic surgery involve lobectomy pneumonectomy ; Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field ; Pure bronchioloalveolar carcinoma subtype nonsmall cell lung cancer ; Active systemic , pulmonary , pleural pericardial infection ; Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic .</criteria>
