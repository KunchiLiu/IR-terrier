	<brief_summary>In elderly population , dry eye syndrome highly prevalent ocular disease . One mainstay therapy patient suffer dry eye syndrome use topically administer lubricant . One main disadvantage formulation currently available treatment DES short residency time ocular surface , increase need frequent instillation lubricant . Recently , Croma Pharma introduce chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop , design treatment symptom related DES . Based theoretical consideration animal experiment , new chitosan derivative may show increased adhesion mucin ocular surface may therefore considerably increase residence ocular surface . This , turn , would limit need frequent treatment decrease burden patient . It show recent Phase I study chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop safe well tolerate single repeat instillation . The current study seek investigate ocular residency time single dose 5 day b.i.d . treatment . For purpose 2 cohort plan : In Cohort I , chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop instill one randomly choose eye , whereas fellow eye receive placebo . Measurements tear film thickness perform optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) instillation 10 minute , 1 hour , 2 hour , 4 hour , 8 hour , 10 hour , 12 hour 24 hour instillation . In addition , ocular scatter tear film assess Optical Quality Analysis System ( OQAS ) timepoints . Determination break time ( BUT ) perform instillation eye drop . In Cohort II , chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop instill daily one eye b.i.d . fellow eye five consecutive day . Measurements tear film thickness OCT OQAS perform every study day morning instillation day last instillation . Additionally , patient ask answer ocular surface disease index ( OSDI© ) day 1 day 6 . BUT determine instillation eye drop .</brief_summary>
