	<brief_summary>Vitamin D3 supplementation reduces incidence multiple sclerosis.Although clinical cross-sectional study demonstrate vitamin D3 positive mediator prevent relapse disease progression , prospective randomize control trial nevertheless necessary confirm statement determine efficacious , safe , minimum required dos . This hypothesis go test randomized triple blind control trial randomization , one group patient receive vitamin D second group receive placebo . Both group go follow similar way period one year follow ups 4 , 8 12 month . Vitamin D level go perform 0,4 , 12 month interval . MRI go do begin end trial.The number relapse physical disability calculate Expanded disability status scale ( EDSS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Vitamin D Reducing Relapse Rate Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : - To estimate prevalence vitamin D deficiency Saudi Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) patient come King Khalid hospital , multiple sclerosis clinic . - To compare difference relapse rate among Multiple Sclerosis patient take vitamin D3 ( 50,000 IU per week ) versus take Vitamin D3 supplement . - To assess compare improvement Expanded Disability Status scale clinical symptom among take vitamin D3 versus placebo Study Design : A single centre , triple-blinded , parallel randomize placebo control trial . Methods : All eligible patient clinical definite MS assign computer-generated Identification number statistician randomization divide two group , one group receive vitamin D3 ( intervention arm ) get placebo ( control arm ) . All patient continue routine pre-intervention trial treatment relapse remission phase multiple sclerosis . The first treatment group receive 50,000 IU unit vitamin D3 per week . The control arm patient , instead vitamin D3 receive placebo supplement look , smell taste vitamin D3 52 week . Compliance study treatment verify ask patient missed dos count use unused bottle . All patient ask question related socio-demographic data , vitamin D relate dietary product , physical activity question , exposure sunlight variation accord season , use sunscreen , body coverage sunlight previous treatment Multiple Sclerosis , include vitamin D supplement . Every follow visit shall include documentation complete neurologic medical history finding . This triple-blinded trial . The patient , treat physician statistician mask type treatment patient receives.Sealed envelope contain vitamin D3 placebo go hand physician computer assign number patient . At follow-up visit patient require bring envelope along empty/ fill bottle assess compliance treatment . The treat physician follow patient set regular interval : 0 ( baseline ) , 4 , 8 , 12 month assess relapse EDSS score also check adverse effect arise vitamin D3 supplement . Patients go miss appointment shall contact project staff set another appointment subsequent week . All patient go emphasized importance clinical visit compliance treatment . All patient evaluate treat physician .</detailed_description>
