	<brief_summary>One big challenge conduct research investigator follow people long period time keep participant involve . One way investigator may able improve participant involvement research give participant opportunity complete questionnaire online . Here 's investigator think Internet data collection system help keep participant involve ultimately help answer important question effect nutrition pregnancy : 1 . It allow investigator present complicate questionnaire way n't confuse participant . For example , instead tell participant skip remainder question answer first part question , ePRO system skip . The result less confusion , few question read , less participant 's time . 2 . It provide convenient way participant keep track find questionnaire , much already complete . Participants sometimes n't time answer investigator 's question one sit . The ePRO system keep track much participant already do 's ready keep go whenever participant time . It also avoid common problem losing questionnaire household paperwork pile , bad recycle bin . 3 . It provide timely reminder participant . Study participant , especially new mom , busy forget complete questionnaire . The ePRO system provide timely reminder encourage participant respond . 4 . It help participant complete questionnaire accurately . The ePRO system automatic error detection ability alert participant question miss complete incorrectly . Finding way keep participant involve research something researcher concern , ultimately 's concern Canadians result research often use make decision health care kind program government provide . Losing participant study reduces ability policy maker take best decision choices health service fund limit dollar . What investigator propose study determine whether Internet data entry really keep participant involve longitudinal study . Previous study show internet useful tool get people sign research least one small study show use Internet data entry actually save money . But researcher actually test whether really good job paper base questionnaire term keep participant involve . In order answer question , investigator randomly assign current Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes Nutrition study participant either continue receive paper-based questionnaire start receive web-based survey . The investigator follow participant three assessment occasion ( period 18 month ) observe difference group involvement . Because investigator randomly assign participant two group , difference involvement tell usefulness Internet data entry participant retention tool .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Internet Data Collection Improve Cohort Retention ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH QUESTIONS : In longitudinal research , participant-initiated internet data entry improve 1 ) participant retention 2 ) data quality ? RESEARCH CONTEXT : While longitudinal research may best tool examine course human health illness lifespan , burden participation many year often result loss participants follow-up . Such attrition reduces statistical power threaten internal validity generalizability inference draw longitudinal data ( Shadish et al. , 2002 ) . Because internet data collection convenient simplifies complex questionnaire , method may reduce participant burden reduce attrition . While internet data collection already regard viable tool participant recruitment ( Smith et al. , 2007 ) usually result data equivalent good quality ( e.g. , factor loading , reliability ) traditional paper-and-pencil method ( Vergnaud et al. , 2011 ) , internet data collection tool increase participant retention within exist longitudinal cohort evaluate previously . The goal current project determine whether internet data collection increase participant retention data quality within APrON ( Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes Nutrition ) study . APrON ongoing longitudinal cohort study conduct Calgary Edmonton , involve 2000 woman , 1200 partner , 2000 child . It design answer question impact maternal nutrient intake status pregnancy : ) maternal mental health , b ) birth outcome , c ) child health development . The data collect Albertans participate health research ( APrON ) provincial treasure , investment need maximize easy , modern technology reduce participant burden promote well long-term follow-up . Although software available single questionnaire data entry ( e.g. , RedCap ) , innovative technology investigator plan introduce evaluate made-in-Alberta solution automate simplifies collection complex short- long-term longitudinal data - process software easily achieve . This technology hold strong potential broad application longitudinal health research . Currently , APrON collect data use traditional paper questionnaire mail regular interval throughout pregnancy child develop first 3 year . At time point , participant also ask attend clinic biological sample physical measure take . The questionnaire long complex ( whether question need answer dependent upon response previous question ) identify major time burden study participant . In recent survey 1763 APrON participant , almost 65 % , indicate would prefer complete study questionnaire via internet - remainder preference . Completion rate paper questionnaires approximately 85 % participant come study clinic in-person visit . However , clinic visit accompany mail questionnaire ( questionnaire complete home return postage pay envelope ) response rate ~ 65 % . RESEARCH PLAN/METHODOLOGY : Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes ( ePRO ) web-based software tool develop Women &amp; Children 's Health Research Institute ( WCHRI ) University Alberta . Pilot study perform University Alberta , however , study first use ePRO study population size . Questionnaires build use Checkbox Survey Server . Automatic email invitation participant base individualized anchor date schedule ( e.g. , questionnaire child age 12 month link individual child 's date birth ) . Participants receive link instruction survey due completion . Reminders automatically send questionnaire complete within appropriate timeline ( e.g. , 2 week ) . Study staff track late incomplete questionnaire , re-send invitation , manually enter data information obtain via paper questionnaire telephone interview . Importantly , system facilitates link data different questionnaire different time point . The investigator propose randomize trial data collection method . Participants allocate use permuted block randomization equal block size APrON participant Calgary one two group : ( 1 ) continue paper-based data collection ; ( 2 ) use ePRO future data collection task . IMPACT/RELEVANCE : In 2008 , Alberta invest significant research fund establish pregnancy birth cohort help develop knowledge need improve health mother infant . Answering health question developmental effect require continued contact follow-up participant every 3-6 month , significant challenge , one international cohort struggle accomplish paper questionnaire . What investigator propose grant evaluate novel approach complex longitudinal research enable data collection convenient , less burdensome , efficient participant . The investigator expect ePRO system : 1 ) increase completion rate track participant progress study , notify time another round questionnaires , administer questionnaire efficient manner ( skip non-relevant question ) , send reminder incomplete questionnaire , 2 ) improve data quality alert participant miss item .</detailed_description>
