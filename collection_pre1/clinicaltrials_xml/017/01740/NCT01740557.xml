	<detailed_description>Pretreatment Procedures : If find eligible take part study , follow test procedure perform begin receive study drug treatment : Within 6 month receive cyclophosphamide fludarabine : - You lung function test . - You cardiac stress test check heart function stressful condition . Your study doctor explain procedure . Within 30 day receive cyclophosphamide fludarabine : - You complete 2 questionnaire quality life . It take 15 minute total complete . - You ( ECG ) check heart function . - You CT ( PET ) /CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - You ( MRI ) scan , CT scan , and/or PET scan brain check status disease - You tumor biopsy check status disease . The type biopsy depend size location tumor . - Blood sample ( 4 tablespoon ) collect evaluate change T-cells . Within 14 day receive cyclophosphamide fludarabine : - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine blood clotting test . - Urine collect check urinary tract kidney function . - If able become pregnant , blood urine pregnancy test . If blood test , part routine blood draw . To take part study , must pregnant . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin receive study drug drug give help low risk side effect . The day lead Day 1 study consider negative day . For example , day Day 0 Day -1 . On Days -7 -6 , receive cyclophosphamide day vein 2 hour . On Day -7 , receive mesna vein non-stop 24 hour . This help protect bladder side effect cyclophosphamide . On Days -5 -1 , receive fludarabine day vein 15-30 minute . On Day 0 , receive CXCR2 NGFR T-cells catheter 4 hour . A catheter thin flexible tube insert body . The catheter may place vein arm large vein neck . If cell need give large vein either upper chest neck , area numb medicine catheter put . Other catheter may need one arm give fluid , medicine , extra nutrition . You sign separate consent catheter , describe procedure risk detail . On Days 1-5 , receive aldesleukin catheter 15 minute every 8-16 hour 15 dos . On Days 22-26 , receive aldesleukin catheter 15 minute every 8-16 hour 15 dos . You receive aldesleukin platelet count high enough . This 5 day dose may actually start early Day 20 may end late Day 33 . You give levofloxacin day mouth vein white blood cell count rise . You receive filgrastim needle skin day white blood cell count rise . You begin receive fluconazole Day 0 mouth white blood cell count rise . You also take trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole ( SMX ) mouth 2 time day , begin Day -7 continue least 3 month chemotherapy . To prevent occurence Herpes Virus Infections , give Valtrex mouth , day 6 month . If take valtrex mouth , receive acyclovir vein one hour visit hospital . Your study doctor explain . The drug furosemide give vein receive cyclophosphamide try increase amount urine body make . The T-cell infusion may cause allergic reaction fever , chill , and/or shivering . You take Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) mouth T-cell infusion decrease risk side effect . You receive drug ondansetron vein 30 minute decrease risk nausea vomit chemotherapy . It possible receive 2nd round chemotherapy , aldesleukin , T-cells . You repeat study visit schedule well . Your doctor discus . Study Visits : Every 1-2 day Days -7 26 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . While receive CXCR2 NGFR T-cells , vital sign measure T-cell infusion , every 15 ( +/- 10 minute ) minute infusion , 1 time hour ( +/- 30 minute ) 4 hour infusion . On Day 3 3 week ( +/-7 day ) T-cell infusion , blood test show cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) past , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check CMV . Some T-cells receive may come donor test positive CMV past . On Days 0 , 6 , 27 , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw check activity T-cells ability attack tumor . If return follow blood also draw 6 week , 12 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year receive CXCR2 NGFR T-cells . On Day 21 ( +/- 7 day ) , tumor biopsy check status disease , doctor think possible . The type biopsy depend size location tumor . At 6 week ( +/- 7 day ) 12 week ( +/- 7 day ) , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You check skin lesion . - You x-ray chest - You CT PET/CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - You ask complete questionnaire health quality life . This questionnaire take 15 minute complete . Leftover blood sample store MD Anderson future research related cancer . Before sample use research , researcher must get approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee doctor , researcher , community member . The IRB responsible protect study participant make sure research safe ethical . Your sample give code number . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge bank access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . Length Study : You may receive 2 round study drug ( 12 week ) . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . If test normal show change , blood ( 2-4 tablespoon ) collect every visit store case develop symptom later . This blood may test check number t-cells blood functioning . If give consent , optional procedure section , blood leave test store use use future research . Long Term Follow-Up : About 6 12 month stop receive study drug T-cells , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check activity T-cells . If unable return follow-up blood draw , ask either phone one standard clinic visit every 3 month year 1 time year 10 year . If study complete sooner , long follow-up . One ( 1 ) time year 15 year , mail two questionnaire health quality life . This questionnaire take 15 minute complete . You give self-addressed , stamp envelope order return questionnaire . This investigational study . CXCR2 NGFR T-cells FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Cyclophosphamide FDA approve commercially available treatment several type cancer ( leukemia , lymphoma , breast cancer ) . Fludarabine FDA approve commercially available treatment B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Aldesleukin FDA approve commercially available treatment Metastatic melanoma renal cell carcinoma . The study doctor tell study drug design work . Up 15 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
