	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose trametinib give together fluorouracil radiation therapy surgery treat patient stage II-III rectal cancer . Trametinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving trametinib together fluorouracil radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximally tolerate dose recommend phase II dose trametinib use combination 5FU ( fluorouracil ) radiation patient rectal cancer . II . To determine recommended phase II dose trametinib use 5FU chemoradiation patient locally advanced rectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation tolerability safety combination trametinib 5-FU chemoradiation locally advanced rectal cancer . II . Evaluation post-therapy pathologic response . III . Evaluation rate local control , disease-free survival overall survival . IV . Analysis biomarkers - total mutation v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) , v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ( BRAF ) , neuroblastoma RAS viral ( v-ras ) oncogene homolog ( NRAS ) , well RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( AKT ) pathway signal pathway potentially correlate clinical benefit . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study trametinib . Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day -14 -10 1-38 fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) continuously 5 day week day 1-38 . Patients also undergo radiation therapy 5 day week day 1-33 . Patients undergo surgery 6-10 week later . Patients achieve negative surgical margin complete resection tumor receive postoperative chemotherapy comprise leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 15 OR oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
