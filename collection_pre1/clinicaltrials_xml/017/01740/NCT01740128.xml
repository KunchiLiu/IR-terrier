	<brief_summary>Many people spinal cord injury ( SCI ) retain least movement injury , muscle often 'mind ' . Typical exercise program focus keep muscle strong flexible , n't usually focus help patient control muscle . The investigator ' exercise research study compare two different program specific goal improve conscious control patient ' muscle injury . This study focus 'chronic ' SCI - injury occur least one year prior enrol . This single center study take place Bronx , NY . The first phase study observational - investigator analyze nerve connection might remain partially intact injury ( even nerve n't consciously control ) . Participants severity SCI may participate first phase . The second phase study involve people retain least slight ability move legs ability move arm gravity . Each person undergo two different exercise rehabilitation strategy : weight-supported treadmill training ; balance training combine skilled arm hand exercise . The investigator compare effect exercise program variety outcome , include gait speed , balance , strength , muscle activation response brain stimulation . The investigator hypothesize participant chronic SCI undergo combine balance/arm/hand train show improve outcome compare traditional gait balance training .</brief_summary>
