	<brief_title>Does Administration Antibiotics Patients Undergoing Surgery Colorectal Cancer Result Less Complications Better Prognosis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Infectious complication especially anastomotic leakage severely impede recuperation patient follow colorectal cancer surgery . When normal gut barrier fail anastomotic leakage , pathogenic microorganism like Gram-negative bacteria enter circulation may cause severe sepsis associate considerable mortality . Moreover , anastomotic leakage negative impact colorectal cancer prognosis . Selective decontamination digestive tract ( SDD ) prophylaxis regimen employ oral nonabsorbable antibiotic eradicate pathogenic micro-organism like Gram-negative bacteria . Objective : The primary objective randomize clinical trial evaluate perioperative SDD reduce clinical anastomotic leakage rate septic consequence well infectious complication . By reduction septic complication long-term oncological outcome might simultaneously improve . Secondary objective decline reoperation rate , in-hospital mortality , readmission rate , duration hospital stay ICU admission , non-infectious complication , improvement quality life reduction cost . Study design : A randomised multicenter clinical trial compare perioperative SDD addition standard antibiotic prophylaxis standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone patient colorectal cancer undergo elective surgical resection curative intent . Study population : Patients 18 year older eligible inclusion diagnose colon rectal cancer without sign distant metastasis . Patients may schedule either laparoscopic open resection curative intent , include construction anastomosis ( either without divert stoma ) . Patients eligible inclusion case concomitant metastasis acute obstruction . Intervention : Patients randomly allocate either perioperative SDD ( intervention group ) include standard antibiotic prophylaxis standard treatment ( include standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone ) ( control group ) . The solution contain SDD orally take 4 time daily , start 3 day surgery continue normal bowel passage least 3 day surgery . Both group receive single preoperative intravenous dose 1000 mg Cefazoline 500 mg Metronidazole , current standard antibiotic prophylaxis . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter anastomotic leakage . The research hypothesis refers estimate decrease anastomotic leakage rate SDD treat group ( 9 % 4 % ) . As anastomotic leakage show unfavourable forlong term oncological outcome , presume improvement disease free survival , serve important secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
