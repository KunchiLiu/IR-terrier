	<detailed_description>Given possible synergism irinotecan bevacizumab colorectal carcinoma , combination study glioma . In study 21 patient , combination irinotecan bevacizumab produce 43 % response rate , acceptable toxicity . The response rate significantly high irinotecan alone therapy recurrent glioma . There two serious adverse event , one intracranial hemorrhage one bowel perforation . At Duke Brain Tumor Center , investigator treat 1000 glioblastoma patient bevacizumab-containing regimen , mark clinical benefit acceptable toxicity . Our initial study look combination bevacizumab irinotecan patient recurrent glioblastoma publish 2007 find impressive response rate survival corroborate earlier experience Starks-Vance . The investigator complete study newly diagnose glioblastoma utilized bevacizumab , radiation therapy temozolomide follow 6 month bevacizumab , irinotecan temozolomide . In addition , group University California Los Angeles publish study bevacizumab , radiation therapy temozolomide follow 12 month bevacizumab temozolomide newly diagnose glioblastoma . These two phase II study report acceptable toxicity suggestion improve survival compare historical control , lead two large phase III randomize , placebo control study addition bevacizumab newly diagnose glioblastoma patient . The current proposal build encourage result addition bevacizumab standard therapy newly diagnose glioblastoma patient . Two critical question remain- role bevacizumab maintenance bevacizumab time progression patient previously treat bevacizumab time initial diagnosis . In addition , retrospective analysis data collect center patient recurrent disease suggest continuation bevacizumab time progression may improve overall survival comparison cessation bevacizumab .</detailed_description>
