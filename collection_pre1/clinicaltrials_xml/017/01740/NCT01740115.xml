	<brief_title>Boston Alcohol Research Collaboration HIV/AIDS ( ARCH ) Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unhealthy alcohol use ( i.e . spectrum range heavy drinking risk health consequence dependence ) common among HIV-infected person associate bad health outcome among people HIV infection . However , much remain unknown alcohol-related health effect affect multiple drug ( particularly opioids ) , specific health effect detriment bone . Alcohol use disrupt bone remodel suppress formation increase resorption ; heavy alcohol use associate osteopenia ( low bone mineral density [ BMD ] ) incidence fracture . Osteopenia common among HIV-infected patient , fracture common patient among adult without HIV infection . Duration HIV infection find associate low BMD , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) also appear associated BMD decline . While bone health likely affect HIV infection , ART , alcohol drug ( e.g . opioid ) use ( addition know risk factor ) , alcohol-osteopenia association among HIV infection well-characterized . It know whether association , magnitude nature association , relationship affect commonly co-occurring factor ( e.g . opioid use , ART ) . Accordingly , part Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network Alcohol Research Collaboration HIV/AIDS ( URBAN ARCH ) Consortium , seek expand continue cohort HIV-infected adult establish Boston ARCH Cohort 250 HIV-infected adult affect multiple substance spectrum alcohol use . This observational prospective cohort study involve in-person assessment take place 6-month interval ; participant follow minimum 1 year maximum 3.5 year . All assessment include researcher-administered questionnaire breath alcohol test . In addition , baseline assessment annual assessment ( 12 , 24 36 month enrollment ) also include : urine pregnancy test ( female ) , blood collection , measurement bone mineral density hip spine ( use Hologic QDR 4500W enhanced-array , whole-body , dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry [ Bone Densitometer ] ) , measurement bone microarchitecture wrist ankle ( use Xtreme CT [ device measure high-resolution three-dimensional peripheral quantitative compute tomography ] ) . We conduct laboratory test blood sample collect time point , include test 25 ( OH ) vitamin D3 phosphatidylethanol ( PEth ) . Remaining plasma serum sample store future study bone marker : parathyroid hormone , testosterone , carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks ( CTX ) ( marker osteoclast activity ) , osteocalcin ( osteoblast activity ) . In summation , study measure effect alcohol consumption change bone health prospectively HIV-infected adult current substance dependence ever injection drug use . To knowledge , prospective HIV/bone study study relevant factor simultaneously use HR-pQCT ass bone microarchitecture . Data alcohol risk bone health important information define risky drinking amount people HIV infection ( advise patient accordingly ) .</detailed_description>
