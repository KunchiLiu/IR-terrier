	<brief_summary>The primary objective present trial investigate , mean operative time study frequency intensity postoperative shoulder tip pain patient undergo laparoscopic surgery , i.e . cholecystectomy , colorectal surgery , hernia repair AirSeal® compare standard pressure CO2 insufflation system . The primary hypothesis patient operate AirSeal® short mean operative time decreased frequency intensity postoperative shoulder tip pain compare patient undergo surgery standard pressure CO2 insufflation system . It secondary objective trial evaluate immunologic anaesthesiological aspect laparoscopic cholecystectomy , colorectal surgery laparoscopic hernia repair observe immune response volume mechanical ventilation two group measure various immunologic factor ventilation volume/CO2 elimination volume . Surgical side effect also measure secondary objective .</brief_summary>
