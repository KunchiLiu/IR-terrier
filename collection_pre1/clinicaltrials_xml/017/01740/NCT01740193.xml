	<brief_title>Comparison Two Different Pain Management Techniques Pediatric Patients Undergoing Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy commonly perform surgical procedure pediatric population . Multimodal anesthesia consist systemic narcotic , surgical wound infiltration local anesthetic ilioinguinal and/or iliohypogastric nerve blockade traditionally employ achieve acceptable analgesia . Recently , ultrasound-based study demonstrate blind abdominal wall injection do poor accuracy . Ultrasound-guided alternative , transverses abdominis plane ( TAP ) block , may improve analgesic efficacy patient comfort post-operative period compare blind landmark base nerve blockade . There increase utilization TAP block adult population due describe ability provide effective blockade thoracolumbar spinal nerve innervate abdominal wall . We propose randomized prospective evaluation analgesic efficacy compare surgeon perform ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric block ultrasound-guided TAP blockade healthy ASA I II pediatric patient undergoing unilateral herniorrhaphy outpatient basis .</detailed_description>
