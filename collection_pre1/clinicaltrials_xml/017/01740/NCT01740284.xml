	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluating Tolerability Grazax Treatment Combination With Antihistamine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many grass pollen allergic subject treat immunotherapy tablet experience treatment related adverse event initiate treatment . The adverse event consider consistent introduction allergen sensitise subject . The majority local allergic reaction within mouth and/or throat . Most reaction mild moderate intensity , onset almost immediately take tablet , last minute hour intake . Appearance adverse event relation tablet intake tends subside spontaneously within 1 7 day . Thus , initiation treatment Grazax may associate discomfort . It anticipate intake antihistamine initiation Grazax treatment would likely reduce discomfort associate initiation Grazax treatment . Therefore , rationale trial investigate administration antihistamine prior initiation Grazax treatment result reduction subject report local allergic reaction .</detailed_description>
