	<detailed_description>Rationale : While exposure obesogenic environment increase almost every individual western society , everyone equally susceptible overeat everyone become obese . Teasing apart physiological underpinnings individual seemingly protective- difference may contribute development successful preventive measure treatment . Neuroimaging study start deliver important insight neuroanatomical determination individual eating behavior . However , food intake determine brain , orchestrated interaction peripheral hormone neural circuit decision-making process . This interactive axis also refer gut-brain axis . While individual aspect axis study extensively , detailed insight interaction gut brain regulation food intake lacking . Objective : The current study aim investigate effect ) caloric restriction ( low calorie diet ( VLCD ) ) ; b ) caloric restriction mechanical restriction ( Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) ) ; c ) caloric restriction mechanical restriction physiological change malapsorption ( Roux- en- Y bypass ( RYGB ) surgery ) gut-brain interaction find optimal balance weight loss long-term sustained weight maintenance . Study design : In repeated measure design total 45 obese ( body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 35 ≤ 45 ) study participant investigate . All participant undergo weight loss period 10 % initial body weight mean VLCD intervention ( n=15 ) , RYGB surgery ( n=15 ) LAGB surgery ( n=15 ) . Study population : The study population compose people qualify surgical weight loss procedure ( RYGB LAGB ) . A total 45 obese ( BMI &gt; 35 ≤ 45 ) study participant age 18 60 investigate Intervention : One subject group ( n=15 ) undergo diet intervention , consist low calorie diet ( VLCD ; Modifast ) contain 2.1MJ/d 1 2 month , lose 10 % initial body weight . This intervention compare 2 weight loss group ; one group undergo RYGB surgery one group undergo LAGB surgery . However , surgical procedure proceed plan accord standard clinical practice , way change . Main study parameters/endpoints : To determine optimal interaction gut hormone brain activity successful weight loss sustain weight maintenance study examine effect interaction gastrointestinal hormone release neural network activation ) caloric restriction ; b ) caloric restriction physiological restriction ; c ) caloric restriction malapsorption food reward processing decision making brain well gastrointestinal hormone release . - The main parameter contribute efficient , effective satisfactorily weight maintenance time change satiety food reward upon iso-energetic test-meal . This main factor contribute compliance prevent reversal , ( measure visual analog scale ( VAS ) , change ad libitum meal intake , representation brain food reward processing decision making , computer test , TFEQ cognitive restraint , disinhibition hunger ) . - Secondary contribution main parameter : - Possible change gut-microbiota population , interact neuronal signal satiety reward ; - The weight loss , change body-composition , change resting- diet-induced energy expenditure , underscore weight maintenance . - Possible change endocannabinoid profile , interact neuronal signal satiety reward Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : This research beneficial subject , , obese , loose body-weight . Subjects include diet induced weight loss group lose 10 % initial weight , beneficial operation , decrease risk . This however compromise possibility undergo surgery BMI decrease 35 , intake surgery base upon initial screening , prove able weight stable already try healthy stable weight weight loss method . All participant come visit metabolic research unit Maastricht ( MURM ) 4 different occasion , twice weight loss procedure twice . These visit combine regular hospital visit much possible . FMRI non-invasive standard method determine blood oxygenation area interest without significant risk ( See document section K6 standardize approve method conduct fMRI experiment involve human subject ) . It technique utilizes magnetic field low-energy radio frequency visualize brain structure brain function . Through careful screening procedure subject metallic fragment body exclude study since fMRI magnet exerts force ferromagnetic object . During test day 2 ( weight loss procedure ) canula insert blood sampling . Blood sample study include risk subject , usual risk minor bruising . One subject group lose 10 % initial body weight use VLCD . There risks subject consume VLCD ( Modifast , together recommend fruit vegetable ) macronutrient composition vitamins/minerals content meet Dutch recommend daily allowance . This VLCD demand energy subject home . However , due extensive experience VLCD laboratory due benefit weight loss participant anticipate enough will-power complete 2 month VLCD . This intervention compare 2 weight loss group ; one group undergo RYGB surgery one group undergo LAGB surgery . RYGB operation first divide stomach small upper pouch much large low `` remnant '' pouch re-arranges small intestine connect , way bypass part small intestine . With LAGB inflatable band place around upper part stomach create small stomach pouch . This slow limit amount food consume one time give opportunity sense satiety meet . It decrease gastric emptying time . However , surgical procedure proceed plan way change . Therefore , explanation beyond scope protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order eligible participate study , subject must qualify weight loss surgery LAGB RYGB , evaluate physician intake surgery . Furthermore , subject must meet following criterion : Subject , male female , age 18 60 year age . Subject must able understand willing sign inform consent document . Subject must willing able participate aspect study agree comply study requirement duration study . Subject body mass index ( BMI ) 40 45 35 39.9 plus one comorbid diseases expect improve weight loss , include limited hypertension , dyslipidemia , obstructive sleep apnea , diabetes mellitus . Subject must sufficient stable medical health , evaluate physician intake . Subject must fail standard obesity therapy diet , exercise , behaviour modification , pharmacologic agent either alone combination , assess intake surgery physician . For fMRI measurement inclusion criterion follow : metallic fragment body , righthanded . Because different brain laterality leave righthanded subject chose include righthanded subject . Hence result compare subject . Subject history of/or sign and/or symptom gastroduodenal ulcer disease , evaluate physician intake surgery . Subject significant weight loss last 3 month ( &gt; 5kg ) . Subject history diagnose eat disorder . Subject renal and/or hepatic insufficiency , evaluate physician intake . Subject thyroid disease , control medication , evaluate physician intake surgery . Female subject pregnant ( i.e. , positive urine blood pregnancy test prior procedure ) , suspect pregnant , lactate childbearing potential refuse use adequate contraception study . Female subject start birth control pills less 3 month enrollment , plan start take birth control pill study . Subjects discontinue either prescription counter weight loss medication least 30 day prior start study well trial period . Subjects start medication within last 3 month know cause weight gain . Subjects cardiac pacemaker electronic implantable device . Subjects psychiatric disease include limited manicdepressive disorder , schizophrenia , borderline personality disorder , depression suicidal tendency . Subject currently use history illicit drug ( ) abuse alcohol ( defined regular daily consumption 4 alcoholic drink per day ) . Subject participate clinical study investigational new drug , biological , therapeutic device within ≤ 28 day prior enrollment study , agree abstain participation clinical trial kind study . Presence contraindication fMRI , mention screen form inform consent faculty psychology ( see section E2 F1 ) . Claustrophobia Being lefthanded Metallic fragment body</criteria>
