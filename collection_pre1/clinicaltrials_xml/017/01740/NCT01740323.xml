	<brief_summary>The main purpose investigation determine curcumin reduce NF-kB DNA bind patient receive XRT breast cancer complete chemotherapy . Patients receive prior chemotherapy eligible , find enrich population particular risk exhibit increase NF-kB DNA bind follow XRT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Curcumin v Placebo Chemotherapy-Treated Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As many 60 % breast cancer ( BrCA ) patient receive radiation know develop fatigue 30 % suffer persistent fatigue several month year treatment completion ( 12-23 ) . The physical , psychological , molecular mechanism patient develop fatigue poorly understood likely multi-factorial . One pathway receive considerable attention nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kB ) ( 24 ) . The NF-kB pathway emerge important role cancer treatment resistance development fatigue . NF-kB activation lead expression interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , factor related inflammation factor find upregulated patient receive radiation well BrCA survivor fatigue ( 25-29 ) . A recently publish study look TNF-alpha , fatigue cachexia cancer patient receive docetaxol show NF-kB upregulated fatigue patient agent inhibit TNF-alpha lead well tolerance chemotherapy dose escalation ( 30 ) . Work group others show ionize radiation increase NF-kB pathway activity circulate immune cell ( well within breast cancer cell ) effect pronounced woman previously treat chemotherapy ( 31 , 32 ) . Our work show NF-kB pathway activity circulate immune cell also relate fatigue development BrCA patient treat radiation patient risk persistent fatigue NF-kB pathway activity receive chemotherapy breast cancer ( 31 ) . Curcumin , know inhibitor NF-kB , show decrease NF-kB activation human participant . In recent study , 8 gram curcumin mouth daily 8 week well tolerate patient pancreatic cancer pre-malignant condition associate toxicity ( 6 , 8 ) . Although concern body 's absorption curcumin , bioavailability curcumin study pancreatic cancer patient show , peak drug level 22 41ng/mL remain relatively constant first 4 week treatment 8 gram curcumin daily ( 8 ) . Clinical trial daily dosage 1,125 2,500mg also confirm safety curcumin also show ability decrease inflammation patient rheumatoid arthritis post-operative patient ( 6 , 33 , 34 ) . In vivo murine model chronic fatigue syndrome also show curcumin may also alleviate symptom fatigue ( 35 ) . While study promise , little known capacity Meriva inhibit NF-kB woman treat BrCA . We hypothesize oral Meriva , know inhibitor NF-kB , may use decrease level NF-kB activity BrCA patient previously treat chemotherapy go receive radiotherapy ( XRT ) , carefully choose group patient particular risk high level NF-kB DNA binding ( direct measure NF-kB pathway activity ) . We choose administer oral Meriva , 500mg BID , patient population base data . Meriva-500 curcumin formulation also contain phosphatidylcholine , derive soy show aid absorption curcumin ( 9 ) , permit low overall dose curcumin . Of note , 1000 mg Meriva contain 200 mg curcuminoids ( &gt; 90 % curcumin ) . By decrease activity NF-kB , fatigue may improve BrCA patient take Meriva . Results study contribute limited research available capacity curcumin treatment , include Meriva , inhibit NF-kB vivo well symptom fatigue associate excessive NF-kB pathway activity BRCA patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female breast cancer patient age 18 recruit study . Patients enrol study meet standard criterion whole breast XRT . Subjects exclude number medical condition contraindication XRT and/or might confound relationship among fatigue , inflammation , include pregnancy , major psychiatric disorder , autoimmune inflammatory disorder , chronic infectious disease ( e.g . HIV , hepatitis B C ) , neurologic disorder uncontrolled cardiovascular , metabolic , pulmonary renal disease ( determined medical history , physical examination laboratory test ) . Subjects history major psychiatric disorder include Schizophrenia Bipolar Disorder diagnosis Substance Abuse Dependence within past 1 year ( determine standardize psychiatric interview ) exclude . Subjects take drug know affect immune system ( e.g . glucocorticoid , methotrexate ) also exclude . Subjects use supplement natural product one week start medication , exclude vitamin calcium supplementation discretion attend physician , exclude . Patients evidence infection determine history , physical exam laboratory test ( complete blood count urinalysis ) baseline exclude . In addition , patient develop evidence infection ( determined history , physical exam laboratory test ) study discontinue study .</criteria>
