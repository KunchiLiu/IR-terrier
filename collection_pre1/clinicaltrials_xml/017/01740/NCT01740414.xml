Therefore , primary aim 6-7 week inpatient study investigate ability MN-166 dose-dependently alter reinforcing , analgesic , subjective , performance , physiological effect oxycodone , commonly abused prescription opioid . This study include 10-day morphine taper phase , follow two study phase ( approximately 18 day ) daily active ibudilast placebo administration , respectively . After detoxification phase , participant randomize receive placebo MN-166 , stabilized medication . Thereafter , participant complete laboratory session .

	<detailed_description>Opioid drug increase glial cell activation consequent cytokine release . These change glial cell activation may relate abuse liability opioid drug include heroin prescription opioids . Data support hypothesis demonstrate glial cell attenuator decrease positive rewarding aspect opioids laboratory animal . Ibudilast ( MN-166 , formerly AV411 ) compound inhibit activation glia thereby inhibits release cytokine . Recent preclinical study demonstrate ibudilast increase analgesic effect opioids , decrease reward effect drug . It also show ibudilast suppresses morphine-induced release dopamine , primary neurotransmitter involved reward reinforce effect abuse drug . Additionally , recently find ibudilast decrease subjective symptom opioid withdrawal opioid dependent human detoxification . Therefore , primary aim 6-7 week inpatient study investigate ability MN-166 dose-dependently alter reinforcing , analgesic , subjective , performance , physiological effect oxycodone , commonly abused prescription opioid . A secondary aim verify ability drug decrease opioid withdrawal symptom initial inpatient detoxification . This inpatient study include detoxification two 18-day study phase . Upon study initiation , participant taper morphine study phase 1 start , randomize receive placebo 50 mg MN-166 BID ( po 0800 2000 hr ) , switch stabilized medication . Thereafter , participant complete 6 laboratory session 9-10 day . Subsequently , Phase 2 , participant cross study arm ( Pbo MN-166 MN-166 Pbo ) , stabilize , complete 6 laboratory session . Days 1-10 study include morphine taper , two subsequent study phase consist 7-8-day medication switch stabilization phase , follow 6 laboratory session next 9-10 day ( 3 sample session 3 choice session ) . During sample session , participant receive one dose oxycodone ( 0 , 15 , 30 mg/70 kg , PO ) available choice session follow day . At least 72 hrs previous sample session , second sample session complete , follow choice session next day . And least 72 hrs second sample session , third final sample session complete , follow final choice session next day . The analgesic , subjective , performance , physiological effect oxycodone measure . During choice session , drug versus money self-administration paradigm employ , progressive ratio complete drug and/or money measure . We hypothesize MN-166 dose-dependently decrease oxycodone self-administration positive subjective response increase analgesic effect drug . A secondary additional objective collect exploratory information potential predictor prescription opioid self-administration include genetic polymorphism , neurocognitive functioning , response stress . Blood sample collect measure various genetic marker hypothesize contribute opioid drug effect ( e.g. , OPRM1 , OPRD1 , OPRK1 , PENK , PDYN , DRD2 , CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 gene ) . Performance neurocognitive task physiological response Trier Social Stress Test assess participant .</detailed_description>
