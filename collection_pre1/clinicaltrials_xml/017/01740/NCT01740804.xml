	<brief_title>Dynamic Circulating Tumor Cell ( CTC ) Changes During Chemotherapy NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational non-intervention study evaluate dynamic CTC count chemotherapy . Patients provide write informed consent pas screening . Peripheral blood drawn first line chemotherapy . Analyze relationship CTC count clinical outcome . The time point blood draw set following : prior 1st cycle chemotherapy , 1 week prior 2nd cycle chemotherapy , posterior 4th cycle ( less 4th cycle ) chemotherapy progressive disease ( PD ) . The specific blood tube CellSave Tube use , 7.5ml blood sample every time . One follow-up ( include phone ) make every 3 month PD death . The clinical outcome first line chemotherapy ultimately obtain .</detailed_description>
