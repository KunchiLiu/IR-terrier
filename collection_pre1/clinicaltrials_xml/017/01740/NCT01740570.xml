	<brief_summary>The goal Part 1 clinical research study find high tolerable dose cabazitaxel give patient glioblastoma . The goal Part 2 learn cabazitaxel help control glioblastoma . The safety study drug also study part . Cabazitaxel design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Cabazitaxel Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Parts/Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 5 group 3-6 participant enrol Part 1 study . After , 44 participant enrol Part 2 . If Part 1 , assign dose level cabazitaxel base join study . Up 5 dose level cabazitaxel test . Two ( 2 ) dose level give 60 minute , 3 give 30 minute . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose level cabazitaxel group , intolerable side effect see . Your dose may lower side effect . If Part 2 , receive cabazitaxel high dose tolerate Part 1 . Study Drug Administration : On Day 1 every 21-day study cycle , receive cabazitaxel vein either 30 60 minute . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You ask drug may take side effect . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This blood drawn every week Cycles 1 2 . On Day 1 every odd-numbered cycle Cycle 1 ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 , ) : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurological exam . - You MRI scan brain check status disease . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . If Part 1 , Day 1 Cycle 2 , physical neurological exam , include measurement weight vital sign . Research Tests Part 1 Only : Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test biomarker test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Blood PK biomarker test drawn follow time point : - Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive study drug , 5 minute finish receive study drug , 1 , 3 , 6 hour finish receive study drug - Days 2 3 Cycle 1 - At time point Day 7 10 Cycle 1 At time study , extra test may perform doctor think need safety . The study doctor tell extra test . Length Treatment : You receive study drug 1 year . You may able continue take study drug beyond doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : After long take study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You ask drug may take side effect . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI scan brain check status disease . - If able become pregnant , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Long-Term Follow-Up : About 30 day receive last dose study drug , either return clinic call ask feeling . Each call last 5-10 minute . If go study treatment intolerable side effect , clinic visit every 6 week point disease appear get bad . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You ask drug may take side effect . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI scan brain check status disease . - If able become pregnant , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . If able come clinic test procedure , do locally result provide research staff . In case , research staff call ask feeling . Each call last 5-10 minute . Every 3 month end-of-treatment visit , call ask feeling . This call take 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Cabazitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment prostate cancer . The use drug brain cancer investigational . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
