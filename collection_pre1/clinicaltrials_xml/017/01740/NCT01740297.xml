	<brief_summary>Phase 1b study evaluate safety talimogene laherparepvec combination ipilimumab . Phase 2 randomize study evaluate safety efficacy talimogene laherparepvec combination ipilimumab versus ipilumumab alone . Talimogene laherparepvec administer intratumor injection , ipilimumab administer intravenous infusion total 4 infusion . Subjects treat talimogene laherparepvec complete response , injectable tumor disappear , disease progression per modify Immune-Related Response Criteria ( irRC ) , intolerance study treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis malignant melanoma . Stage IIIB , IIIC , IVM1a , IVM1b , IVM1c disease suitable surgical resection Phase1 : Treatment naïve : Must receive prior systemic anticancer treatment consist chemotherapy , immunotherapy , target therapy unresected stage IIIB IV melanoma . Phase 2 : Either treatment naïve receive one line systemic anticancer therapy BRAF wildtype two line systemic anticancer therapy include one BRAF inhibitorcontaining regimen BRAF mutant . Treatments give adjuvant setting ( eg , interferon , radiotherapy , isolated limb perfusion , investigational agent ) consider prior line therapy . No prior talimogene laherparepvec , oncolytic virus therapy , tumor vaccine allow , even give adjuvant set . Phase 2 : Subjects treat prior ipilimumab must PR , CR , least 6 month stable disease follow disease progression . Phase 2 : Subjects previously treat antiPD1 antiCTLA4 antibody must discontinue therapy due treatmentrelated adverse event include immunerelated adverse event . Prior treatmentrelated adverse event also fully resolve require treatment least 28 day prior randomization . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal , coagulation function Primary uveal mucosal melanoma History evidence melanoma associate immunodeficiency state ( eg , hereditary immune deficiency , organ transplant , leukemia ) Phase 1b : History evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases Phase 2 : Clinically active cerebral melanoma metastasis . Subjects 3 cerebral metastasis , neurological performance status 0 may enrol , provide lesion adequately treat stereotactic radiation therapy , craniotomy , Gamma knife therapy , evidence progression , required steroid , least 2 month prior enrollment . History evidence symptomatic autoimmune disease ( pneumonitis , glomerulonephritis , vasculitis , rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , scleroderma , ) , history autoimmune disease require systemic treatment ( ie , use corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug biological agent use treatment autoimmune disease ) past 2 month prior enrollment . Replacement therapy ( eg , thyroxine hypothyroidism , insulin diabetes mellitus ) consider form systemic treatment autoimmune disease . History plan splenectomy splenic irradiation Active herpetic skin lesion prior complication HSV1 infection ( eg , herpetic keratitis encephalitis ) . Requires intermittent chronic systemic ( intravenous oral ) treatment antiherpetic drug ( eg , acyclovir ) , intermittent topical use Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) disease Known acute chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C infection Phase 1b : Prior talimogene laherparepvec , ipilimumab , Cytotoxic Tlymphocyte associate antigen 4 ( CTLA4 ) inhibitor , program death1 ( PD1 ) inhibitor , tumor vaccine Phase 2 : Prior talimogene laherparepvec , oncolytic virus therapy , tumor vaccine Currently receive less 28 day since end systemic anticancer treatment unresected stage IIIB IV melanoma</criteria>
