	<brief_title>EPIC WheelS Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many old adult rely manual wheelchair ( MWC ) community mobility , provide skill independent effective use wheelchair . Suboptimal use wheelchair result substantial social cost reduce engagement meaningful activity , social isolation , high caregiver burden . This poor use financial resource , include cost wheelchair acquisition requirement attendant care . Access skills training constrain expense limited availability skilled therapist ; demand patient and/or clinician travel ; lack training program design specifically old adult . Enhancing Participation In Community improve Wheelchair Skills ( EPIC WheelS ) individualize home-training program optimizes learn old adult limit time demand expert trainer . Using affordable mainstream computer tablet device , EPIC WheelS provide structured train program customize specific user need . The tablet mobile , in-chair tabletop use , home community location . A touch screen operate audio-visual display feature interactive training practice activity well video-recording capability . Wireless Internet enable user-trainer communication remote program monitoring update trainer . A monitored home program effective efficient old adult potential application target group , particularly rural remote location limit access rehabilitation . PURPOSE : The purpose evaluate feasibility effect size estimate 1-month customized home training program ( EPIC WheelS ) improve wheelchair mobility skill among novice old adult manual wheelchair user compare usual care . Despite pervasive use wheelchair intervention rehabilitation , evidence training effective wheelchair use still underdevelop . Structured training demonstrate excellent potential , effective efficient mean provide train remains unclear . Larger multi-site clinical trial require establish evidence inform direct clinical practice . The investigator propose 2-year feasibility trial critical , also prudent , prior move forward expensive large multi-site randomized control trial ( RCT ) . Specifically result study address 1 ) feasibility outcome ( i.e. , recruitment retention ; trainer subject burden ; safety ; intervention administration adherence ; perceive benefit ) 2 ) clinical outcome ( i.e. , effect size calculation primary secondary measure ) . Although principal intent feasibility , sample size calculation base primary clinical outcome provide reasonable estimate effect size planning subsequent large scale RCT . HYPOTHESES : The investigator expect feasibility outcome sufficiently robust support conduct subsequent multi-site RCT . The investigator also expect EPIC WheelS train program significant treatment effect improvement wheelchair mobility , compare control group . The primary clinical endpoint wheelchair skill capacity , measure Wheelchair Skills Test ( WST ) . Secondary clinical outcome include wheelchair skill safety ; confidence wheelchair use ; mobility ; user evaluation performance participation-oriented activity .</detailed_description>
