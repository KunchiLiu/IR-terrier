	<brief_summary>To evaluate pain response use Aurora lance device Velvet 33g lancet compare common , commercially available lance system . Subjects test device depth set sufficient provide enough blood volume trigger OneTouch速 Ultra速Mini blood glucose meter use OneTouch速 Ultra速 blood glucose test strip either fingertip alternate site testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lancing Device Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A low-pain lancing develop code name Aurora ) use 33g proprietary lancet ( code name Velvet ) . This study evaluate pain associated finger lance use device compare pain commercially available lance device associate lancet . All lancet use study currently commercially available except Facet 33g lancet , prototype version commercially available lancet . The Roche Multiclix , Roche Softclix , One Touch Comfort Bayer Microlet 2 lance device commercially available . The Aurora Lancing Device effective obtain sufficient blood sample perform accurate blood glucose measurement ; benefit use Aurora Lancing Device outweigh residual risk associate product . Literature concern blood glucose test research use popular medical database pubmed.gov , diabeteshealth.com , clinicaltrial.gov search term lance device , clinical study , blood volume pain . Using popular search engine Google beneficial help support claim concern safety efficacy . A commercial database company , NERAC use part literature research effort . Our review , together preliminary in-house bench testing , show Aurora Lancing Device able : - Obtain enough blood volume meter read measure blood glucose level ; - Is safe comparative lancing device currently market ; - Produces pain comparative lancing device currently market use 28 gauge needle ; - Is representative `` current state art '' The Aurora Lancing Device use 33 gauge , uniquely design lancet develop project Velvet . The blood lancet design use Aurora lance device . The lancing device feature multiple depth setting include alternate site test capability . The lancet guidance system design maximize lancet control thereby increase comfort reduce pain perception . The Aurora lancing device comparable Roche Softclix lance device already commercial distribution . Like Aurora Roche Softclix lance device offer diabetic unique lancet design precise lancet motion . Roche Softclix use 28 gauge lancet eleven depth setting well alternative site test capability .</detailed_description>
