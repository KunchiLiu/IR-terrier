	<brief_title>Cryotherapy Joint Biomechanics During Running</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryotherapy cold therapy widely use treatment modality acute chronic injury . It believe application cryotherapy help decrease pain , muscle soreness , soft tissue swell , cause vasoconstriction blood vessel reduce heat loss . The nerve conduction velocity muscle-spindle firing rate also decrease cryotherapy , result change proprioception acuity . Cryotherapy also use prior exercise ( pre-cooling ) improve endurance activity . However , give possible detrimental effect cryotherapy proprioception acuity , use treatment modality prior exercise could pose increase risk musculoskeletal injury . The effect cryotherapy low extremity biomechanics athletic movement poorly understood despite wide use among physiotherapist , athletic therapist clinician . Therefore , purpose investigation determine effect cold water immersion low extremity biomechanics run . The investigator hypothesize cryotherapy form treatment increase load low extremity joint gait biomechanics .</detailed_description>
