	<brief_summary>Patients high grade glioma increase overall survival progression free survival initial treatment . Because good performance status patient often eligible re-treatment example radiotherapy . However , date prospective study re-irradiation glioma exist little known effect re-irradiation quality life cognition . This trial design longitudinally establish effect re-irradiation quality life , cognition physical performance patient high grade glioma . Based currently available information investigator hypothesize quality life re-irradiation keep stable tumour progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Re-irradiation High Grade Gliomas : Quality Life Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment regime , addition temozolomide , improve progression-free survival well overall survival patient high grade glioma . The median overall survival ( MOS ) patient glioblastoma ( GBM ) 14.6 month , progression free survival ( PFS ) 6.9 month . Due long survival well performance status , patient often reach point re-treatment feasible . Treatment option recurrent glioblastoma anaplastic glioma include surgery , chemotherapy re-irradiation . Re-irradiation patient recurrent high grade glioma slowly become standard care . It provide comparable overall survival palliative chemotherapy . In case GBM median time progression treatment 20-27 week MOS 26 60 week . Patients tumor recurrence significantly bad quality life compare patient without recurrence follow-up . They experience significantly problem physical functioning ( e.g . motor dysfunction , weakness leg , visual disorder ) , work daily activity , mental health ( e.g . future uncertainty ) general health . With regard re-irradiation , current available data mostly provide retrospective study often lack solid quality life data . Endpoints include e.g . performance status , clinical ( neurological ) status decrease steroid requirement treatment . These endpoint however inadequate determine quality life accurately . Several study use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire core 30 ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) brain cancer module ( QLQ-BN20 ) scale assess quality life . The latter consist 20 item include visual disorder , motor dysfunction , various disease symptom , treatment toxicity future uncertainty . A change 10 point scale consider clinically relevant . To date Ernst-Stecken colleague use EORTC QLQ-C30 prospectively evaluate quality life patient recurrent malignant glioma radiotherapy . In study patient treat hypofractionation . The quality life questionnaire score could keep stable two third patient median follow-up 9 month . They conclude hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy effective treatment help maintain quality life acceptable period , comparable result find chemotherapeutic regime . In patient glioma , tumor , radiotherapy well chemotherapy disrupt cognitive function . Cognitive functioning evaluate cognitive screening instrument and/or comprehensive neuropsychological test battery . The well-known convenient screen instrument Mini Mental-State Examination ( MMSE ) . However , MMSE develop assess dementia include item related executive function . As , MMSE insufficient ass frontal-subcortical network dysfunction associate cognitive damage irradiation . More sensitive cognitive test administer determine effect re-irradiation cognition . There however still little consensus test use . Although comprehensive neuropsychological test battery sensitive , brief cognitive screening preferable present setting . For trial , investigator intend use number relevant standard test include Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised ( HVLT-R , Trail Making Test Controlled Oral Word Association ( COWA ) suggest Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) . The Stroop colour-word test ( Stroop ) add battery order ass visual attention . Physical function major impact quality life patient cancer . A number study investigate effect exercise physical functioning . They show , predominantly patient breast cancer , exercise beneficial effect health well-being . Physical performance measure several mean . The hand grip strength ( HGS ) test validate previous study evaluation general health status . This test perform Jamar hand dynamometer display hand strength kilogram . By compare data re-irradiation data collect treatment amount muscle strength loss determine . Another method measure physical performance analyze fatigue . This common symptom cancer patient negatively influence quality life . Fatigue patient cancer determine use EORTC QLQ-C30 specific Fatigue Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-FA13 ) .</detailed_description>
