	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study best dose radiation therapy treat patient locally advance non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy , stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . SBRT show provide excellent result use early stage lung cancer , yet apply patient advanced disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Alternative Radiation Fractionation Strategy Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To test safety tolerability alternative fractionation regimen locally advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , consist 44 Gy concurrent chemotherapy follow stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) boost remain parenchymal nodal disease . The maximum tolerate dose SBRT boost determine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To assess local control . 2 . To assess distant metastasis pattern failure . 3 . To assess overall survival 1 2 year . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study radiation therapy SBRT . Patients undergo radiation therapy daily receive carboplatin paclitaxel weekly 4.5 week . Patients undergo 2 boost SBRT treatments 2-3 day apart . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
