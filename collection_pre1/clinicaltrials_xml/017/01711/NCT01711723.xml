	<brief_summary>In accordance recently revise FDA draft renal impairment guidance ( March 2010 ) advise conduct renal impairment study drug predominately eliminate renal route , propose study conduct formally assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) darapladib severely renally impaired subject . In open-label , non-randomized study eight subject severe renal impairment recruit along 8 healthy control subject match severe renal impairment subject base gender , body mass index ( plus minus 20 % ) age ( plus minus 10 year ) . All subject receive repeat oral dos darapladib 160 milligram ( mg ) 10 consecutive day . The pharmacokinetics darapladib metabolite ; safety tolerability evaluate . All subject admit clinic even Day -1 . Subjects may check clinic Day 2 assessment complete , must return clinic day ( Days 3-8 ) dose assessment . Subjects admit clinic evening Day 9 . After last dose study drug , follow-up period include 2 visit ( Day 20-24 Day 38-52 ) . The total study duration subject include screening , treatment follow-up period approximately 11 week .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A male female eligible enter participate study he/she : A healthy subject normal renal function : Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure ; Estimated Creatinine clearance ≥ 90mL/min calculated CockcroftGault equation use serum creatinine OR A renally impaired subject To classify renally impaired , subject must : An estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 30 ml/min /1.73 m2 use four variable Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation . Age 18 75 year inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140pmol/L ) confirmatory ] ; Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list protocol appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point .

Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception female subject . Pregnant female determine positive serum hCG test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Subjects risk noncompliance follow direction adhere study instruction , subject principal investigator deem unsuitable participation continuation . Renally Impaired Subjects Subjects life expectancy le 3 month . Anticipated need dialysis study . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen , except subject prescription pain anxiolytic medication would cause positive test . Investigator consult medical monitor patient history screen know patient could positive test . Subjects positive HIV antibody test . Subjects use concurrent prohibit medication , and/or receive concurrent therapy safely discontinue approve Investigator ( see protocol detail prohibit medication ) . Cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) , unstable liver disease ( define presence follow felt investigator relate liver disease disease process : ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminemia , oesophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice ) , evidence abnormal liver function test ( total bilirubin alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal [ ULN ] ; ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN ) hepatic abnormality opinion investigator would preclude subject participation study . Severe asthma poorly control pharmacotherapy . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Requiring use oral injectable strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( refer protocol ) . Consumption grapefruit grapefruit juice within 7 day prior first dose study medication If opinion Investigator unstable cardiovascular , pulmonary , hepatic condition present , medical condition Investigator Medical Monitor considers sufficiently serious interfere conduct , completion , result trial constitutes unacceptable risk subject . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof , history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . History anaphylaxis , anaphylactoid ( resemble anaphylaxis ) reaction ( refer protocol . History severe allergic response .
