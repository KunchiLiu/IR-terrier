	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together combination chemotherapy see well work treat patient stage IV head neck cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective give without veliparib treat head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Veliparib Treating Patients With Stage IV Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend phase II dose , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , safety ABT-888 ( veliparib ) carboplatin paclitaxel induction chemotherapy locoregionally advanced head neck ( LAHNC ) patient . ( Phase I ) II . Compare magnitude tumor shrinkage ( response ) follow 2 cycle induction chemotherapy without ABT-888 LAHNC . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare progression-free ( PFS ) , disease-specific ( DSS ) , overall survival ( OS ) subject treat without ABT-888 . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study veliparib follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 , paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue concomitant chemoradiotherapy . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive veliparib , paclitaxel , carboplatin Phase I . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 10 day completion course 2 , patient begin concomitant chemoradiotherapy . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID day 1-7 . Patients also receive paclitaxel carboplatin Phase I . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 10 day completion course 2 , patient begin concomitant chemoradiotherapy . CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : Patients assign 1 2 regimen concomitant chemoradiotherapy base guideline institution treat . OPTION I ( CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIATION WITH CISPLATIN ) : Patients receive cisplatin IV day 1 22 undergo radiation therapy 5 day per week 6 week . Treatment repeat every 2 week 5 course . OPTION II ( CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIATION WITH TFHX ) : Patients receive hydroxyurea PO every 12 hour day 1-5 11 dos , fluorouracil IV 120 hour day 1-5 , paclitaxel IV day 1 , undergo radiation therapy BID day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 5 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 , 60 month . Patients progress follow every 6 month year 5 .</detailed_description>
