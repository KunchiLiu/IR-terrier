	<brief_summary>Melanoma life-threatening cancer pose significant health burden , especially metastatic spread area original tumor growth . Although various treatment option currently available melanoma , melanoma metastasize widely skin pose significant clinical challenge available therapy limit effect . This study propose use topically apply compound name diphenylcyclopropenone ( DPCP ) show effective treat melanoma patient whose disease spread widely throughout skin . DPCP work patient 's immune system , usually use fight infection , attack cancerous cell . This compound commonly use treat condition warts hair loss throughout world many year know cause limited side effect . Altering patient 's immune system topical treatment also show benefit patient cancer metastasize skin breast cancer . In study , investigator use DPCP treat cutaneous metastasis various cancer include melanoma .
