	<brief_title>Effect Omeprazole Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metformin widely use drug treatment type 2 diabetes . This insulin-sensitizing agent well know beneficial effect glycemic control , also cardiovascular system . The antihyperglycemic effect metformin mainly base suppression hepatic gluconeogenesis activation AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , suppress glucagon-stimulated glucose production cause increase glucose uptake muscle hepatic cell . Metformin actively transport across membrane . The organic cation transporter 1 ( OCT1 ) responsible uptake metformin hepatocytes , essential step reduce hepatic glucose production . , closely associated pharmacological action/adverse reaction . However , metformin alone think insufficient achieve good metabolic control . Thus , treatment addition metformin often require . Sitagliptin attenuate metformin-mediated AMPK phosphorylation inhibition organic cation transporter PPIs frequently use metformin-treated patient metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease . Moreover , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) commonly see patient type 2 diabetes proton-pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) drug best choice treatment GERD . These data support hypothesis proton pump inhibitor use treat type II diabetes . Moreover , PPIs appear significant glucose-lowering effect animal model type 2 diabetes regardless whether metformin administer concurrently . A recent in-vitro study find PPI inhibit metformin uptake organic cation transporter ( OCTs ) . This drug-drug interaction clinical potential relevance consequence metformin disposition and/or efficacy . Since possibility combine use metformin omeprazole chronic diabetic , study plan investigate effect nicorandil activity gliclazide normal diabetic rat evaluate effectiveness combination . The study plan find pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics metformin presence omeprazole healthy subject evaluate mechanism interaction occur .</detailed_description>
