	<brief_summary>Acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) drug use commonly relief mild moderate pain . It find many pain medicine people take surgery . Narcotics drug also use pain ( examples narcotic morphine relate pain medication ) . Medical science know fact acetaminophen work well take narcotic moderate severe pain . Recently , acetaminophen become available intravenous ( IV ) form call Ofirmev® . The IV form mean acetaminophen give vein . The benefit get medicine IV include : - make medicine work quickly - less medicine pas liver change form body process The investigator know acetaminophen helpful pain relief time surgery surgery . Acetaminophen popular drug outpatient surgery pain control patient go home . The patient 's surgeon us control pain surgery home form Lortab Percocet ( Lortab Percocet also narcotic medicine mix acetaminophen ) . Also , currently Surgicare , anesthesiologists give intravenous acetaminophen patient wait go surgery . The investigator currently give patient acetaminophen mouth BEFORE surgery . However , since addition IV form drug market , interest see oral form good well reduce pain surgery . This ask patient join study . The goal study find oral form ( mouth ) IV form ( give vein ) acetaminophen control pain surgery better .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Equality Study Ofirmev v Oral Acetaminophen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Society Anesthesiologists recommend acetaminophen , NSAIDS , COX-2 inhibitor part multimodal pain management strategy limit opioid usage ( 1 ) . As surgical patient population become complex comorbidities range obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , asthma become common , medical community continue search efficacious analgesic high safety profile . While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug play important role multi-modal analgesia , use limit base concern platelet inhibition , asthma exacerbation , renal artery perfusion patient advance age reduce creatinine clearance . Acetaminophen proven important analgesic perioperative setting . It frequently combine opiate allow synergism , use sole analgesic provide 4 hour relief moderate pain . While acetaminophen 's main role multimodal analgesic regimen tablet form opioid/acetaminophen combination post- anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , acetaminophen emerge important perioperative analgesic due FDA approval intravenous ( IV ) formulation ( Ofirmev® ) United States 2010 . While new intravenous formulation approve base upon postoperative effectiveness safety , also interest preoperative use . [ 12 , 13 ] The benefit IV acetaminophen claim oral modality 70 % high blood concentration single similar dose ( 1 gram ) oral acetaminophen rapid onset peak blood concentration within 15 minute infusion similar oral dos may take 90 minute reach peak plasma concentration . Many study compare IV formulation acetaminophen ( Ofirmev® ) oral formulation dose 1 gram . However , take account difference pharmacokinetics oral intravenous formulation . A 15-minute constant infusion 1 gram acetaminophen result average plasma concentration 25.02 μg/ml end infusion subsequent decline approximately 11 μg/ml 1 hour 7 μg/ml 3 hour start infusion . Pain score low one hour remain significantly low least three hour . [ FDA med review ] Moreover , pharmacokinetics immediate release oral formulation acetaminophen well-known . The absorption half life acetaminophen healthy subject range 0.06-0.7 hour ( 8 ) . The relative bioavailability range 85 % 98 % . Moreover , low first pas metabolism hepatic extraction ratio 0.11 0.37 ( 9 ) . After oral administration 1 gram acetaminophen immediate release formulation ( IR ) , peak concentration acetaminophen adult range 7.7 17.6 μg/mL within 1 hour . Although therapeutic range acetaminophen well establish , plasma concentration 10-20 mcg/ml associate antipyretic activity , previous work assume antipyretic analgesic dos similar . ( 3-4 ) . However , another study develop two compartmental pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model relate plasma concentration pain score relationship child receive oral acetaminophen 30 minute outpatient tonsillectomy . The model demonstrate one point decrease pain score concentration increase 10 μg/mL 20 μg/mL steep loss pain protection concentration fell 6 - 7 μg/mL . Therefore , study indicate saturation analgesic effect acetaminophen threshold plasma concentration low 7 μg/mL . The basis proposal stem recent study J Van Der Westhuizen , et al . They set determine traditional one gram unit dose reach adequate serum concentration great 10 mcg/ml . They compare 1 gram intravenous ( IV ) oral acetaminophen see one achieve therapeutic plasma concentration peri-operatively long . This study question use oral acetaminophen 1 gram achieve therapeutic concentration , patient get optimal care ( 5 ) . From study , able extrapolate oral dos 20 mg/kg would achieve maximum concentration 19 mcg/ml ( median maximum concentration achieve IV acetaminophen ) . The study conclude subject 75 kg , effective IV equivalent oral acetaminophen dose would 1.5 gram even 2 gram subject exceed 100 kg ( 5 ) . This study recommend follow study evaluate high dose oral acetaminophen relate pain score rescue medication postoperatively compare IV dose 1 gram . The current unit dose oral acetaminophen 1 gram every 6 hour . However , many study evaluate effect higher dose oral acetaminophen well ( 10 , 11 ) . One study support use 5-6 gram acetaminophen 24- hour period order reduce requirement postoperative morphine . requirement ( 6 ) . Another study measure serum CSF concentration one hour administration 500 mg , 1 gm , 1.5 gm , 2 gm oral acetaminophen ( 7 ) . In summary , investigator 's hypothesis similar dose less effective , 1.5 gram dose oral acetaminophen ( determined extrapolation maximum serum concentration Van Der Westhuizen , et al . study ( 5 ) ) may effective 1.0 gram IV acetaminophen reduce postoperative pain score total opioid consumption , thus result low cost patient provider . II . Specific Aims : The investigator 's aim compare effect 1.5 gram oral acetaminophen 1 gram IV acetaminophen give preoperatively patient undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair single surgeon single facility . The primary outcome evaluate total opioid consumption post anesthesia care unit PACU nominal pain score . The investigator theorize 1.5 gram oral acetaminophen efficacious 1 gram IV acetaminophen result low cost patient provider .</detailed_description>
