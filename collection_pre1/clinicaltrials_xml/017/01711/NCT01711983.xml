	<detailed_description>Ostium secundum atrial septal defect present persistent communication atrium common congenital cardiac anomaly accounting approximately 10 % congenital heart disease . They one common congenital heart defect present adulthood . Untreated , ASDs produce right heart volume overload progressive impairment time , include reduce aerobic capacity , atrial dysrhythmias , congestive heart failure , pulmonary hypertension , potential paradoxical embolism . In U.S. alone estimate approximately 10,000 new patient per year expect ASD . Successful surgical repair ASD perform 50 year continue improvement technique outcome . King Mills report first transcatheter closure ASD 1976 , delivery system quite large impractical , especially young patient . With time , improvement design concepts material discovery lead improved result transcatheter closure system . Several device available commercially transcatheter ASD closure .</detailed_description>
