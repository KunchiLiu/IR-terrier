	<criteria>Relapsed refractory Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) . Treated least 1 prior regimen myeloma 1 . Prior treatment bortezomib ( Velcade ) acceptable washout 2 week 2 . Treatment prior autologous transplant permit 3 . If transplant use consolidation follow chemotherapy , without intervene disease progression , consider 1 line treatment precede chemotherapy Diagnosis symptomatic MM define International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) : 1 . Second line greater/Refractory/Relapsed , Stage I , Stage II , Stage III 2 . Measureable disease indicate monoclonal protein serum great equal ( ≥ ) 1 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) , involve serum free light chain assay ≥10 mg/dL ( ≥100 mg/L ) provide serum free light chain ratio abnormal ; monoclonal light chain urine protein electrophoresis ≥ 200 mg/24 hour , measurable plasmacytoma At least 1 osteolytic bone lesion Diseasefree active second/secondary prior malignancy equal 5 year exception currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` insitu '' cervix breast Ambulatory patient great equal ( ≥ ) 30 year age Performance status 0 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale Estimated life expectancy ≥ 26 week Adequate organ function include : 1 . Hematologic : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal ( ≥ ) 1000/microliter 2 . Platelet ( PLT ) count ≥ 75,000/microliter 3 . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 8.0 g/dL 2 . Acceptable coagulation status : 1 . Prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless receive anticoagulation therapy . If receive anticoagulation therapy , eligibility base upon International Normalization Ratio ( INR ) 2. International normalize ratio ( INR ) less equal ( ≤ ) 1.6 ( unless receive anticoagulation therapy ) If receive warfarin : INR ≤ 3.0 ( active bleeding , [ i.e. , bleed within 14 day prior first dose study therapy ] ) 3 . Hepatic : 1 . Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 2 . Alanine Transaminase ( ALT ) Aspartate Transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( liver metastasis present , ≤ 5 x ULN allow ) 4 . Renal : 1 . Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL use Cockcroft Gault Method Women childbearing potential ( WCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 10 14 day within 24 hour start study drug 1 . WCBP must agree pregnancy test monthly ( every 14 day woman irregular cycle ) study drug 4 week last dose study drug 2 . Men must also agree use condom partner child bear potential , even successful vasectomy 3 . Males female reproductive potential must agree use medically approve contraceptive precaution start 4 week prior initiation therapy trial 18 month follow last dose study drug 4 . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately Provide write informed consent prior studyspecific procedure Are reliable willing make available duration study willing follow study procedure Received treatment investigational drug , receive regulatory approval indication , within 28 day study treatment DKN01 Received experimental nondrug therapy ( e.g. , donor leukocyte/mononuclear cell infusion ) within 56 day entry Previously treat antiDickkopf1 ( antiDKK1 ) antibody therapy , significant allergy know pharmaceutical therapy , opinion Investigator , pose increase risk patient Received radiation therapy , surgery , chemotherapy within 2 week prior study entry ( 6 week nitrosoureas Mitomycin C ) Received bisphosphonates ( e.g. , etidronate , clodronate , tiludronate , pamidronate , neridronate , olpadronate , alendronate , ibandronate , risedronate , zoledronate ) within 2 week prior study entry Symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) malignancy metastasis . Patients treat CNS metastasis eligible provided disease radiographically stable , asymptomatic , currently receive corticosteroid and/or anticonvulsant . Screening asymptomatic patient without history CNS metastasis require Have history major organ transplant ( example : heart , lung , liver , kidney ) Are pregnant nursing Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBSAg ) , hepatitis C antibody ( HCAb ) Active , uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection , include urinary tract infection , within 7 day study entry require systemic therapy Serious cardiac condition myocardial infarction within past 6 month , unstable angina , Class III IV congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) ; ECG abnormalities include baseline 12lead ECG Fridericiacorrected QT interval ( QTcF ) &gt; 470 msec ( female ) &gt; 450 msec ( male ) , history congenital long QT syndrome , ECG abnormality , opinion Investigator , would preclude safe participation study History osteonecrosis hip evidence structural bone abnormality proximal femur MRI scan consider clinically significant may impact interpretation scan .
