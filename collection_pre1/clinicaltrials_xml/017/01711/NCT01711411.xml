In current African setting , surgical circumcision available adult . Recently , device develop potential simplify shorten training time surgical duration eliminate need suture hemostasis well allow task-shifting low level cadre provider . Small-scale safety study , RCTs , field demonstration cohort study require safety , effectiveness , acceptability feasibility device assure . This prospective observational study PrePex male circumcision device , conduct aim ascertain important adverse event unexpected side effect may observe study . This study conduct within routine service delivery system identify potential issue must address MC service scale variety Kenyan setting .
