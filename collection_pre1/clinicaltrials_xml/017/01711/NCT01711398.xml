	<brief_summary>The experimental plan consist : The dose-finding Bayesian adaptive phase I portion study design determine optimal recommend dose IPP-204106N use Bayesian `` memory '' design combine toxicity pharmacokinetic endpoint determine dos successive cohort three patient . The Bayesian methodology allow update information trial progress stop trial soon information obtain deem sufficient . Preclinical toxicokinetic study N6L IPP-204106N dog first phase I clinical trial N6L use inform prior distribution present study . The decisional part , accord result phase I portion study , define optimal dose recommend phase IIa portion study . The phase IIa portion study confirm optimal dose , design evaluate safety preliminary efficacy IPP-204106N expand patient population treat recommend dose IPP-204106N .</brief_summary>
