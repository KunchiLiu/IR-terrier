	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together dinutuximab without isotretinoin treat young patient neuroblastoma respond treatment come back . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide isotretinoin , work different want stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , dinutuximab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) together dinutuximab therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Dinutuximab With Without Isotretinoin Treating Younger Patients With Refractory Recurrent Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) lenalidomide combination fix dos ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) isotretinoin give child refractory recurrent neuroblastoma . II . To define toxicity lenalidomide administer combination ch14.18 isotretinoin . III . To describe difference immune function modulation `` low '' versus `` high '' dose lenalidomide give ch14.18 isotretinoin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics lenalidomide give combination regimen . II . To determine steady state pharmacokinetics isotretinoin ( day 28 , course one ) give combination lenalidomide . III . To measure peak trough level ch14.18 patient receive lenalidomide compare historical control patient receive ch14.18 combination interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . IV . To describe immunological effect lenalidomide ( T cell , natural killer [ NK ] cell , monocyte , cytokine , chemokines ) within three drug regimen . V. To define incidence titer human anti-chimeric antibody ( HACA ) regimen . VI . To describe , within context phase I study , response rate lenalidomide combine ch14.18 isotretinoin patient recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma . VII . To summarize , within context phase I study , event-free survival patient recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma complete response ( CR ) progressing , treat lenalidomide combine ch14.18 isotretinoin . VIII . To determine , within context phase I study , killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR ) receptor-ligand mismatch specific Fc gamma receptor ( Fc gamma R ) alleles associate anti-tumor response . IX . To quantify neuroblastoma tumor cell `` load '' use 5-gene TaqMan Low Density Array ( TLDA ) assay peripheral blood study entry , follow , disease evaluation end therapy bone marrow study entry , response evaluation bone marrow sample , end therapy . X . To compare toxicity regimen historical toxicity data Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) ANBL0032 ANBL0931 study ch14.18 IL-2 , GM-CSF isotretinoin . XI . To describe tolerability ability give full dos ch14.18 lenalidomide extend period time , i.e . course 6-12 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , dinutuximab IV 10 hour day 8-11 , isotretinoin PO twice daily ( BID ) day 15-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
