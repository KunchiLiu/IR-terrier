	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab give chemoradiation therapy treat patient stag IB2-IIB IIIB-IVA cervical cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , may find tumor cell help carry tumor-killing substance . Giving ipilimumab together chemoradiation therapy may better way treat cervical cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) adjuvant ipilimumab follow concurrent weekly cisplatin extend field radiation woman newly diagnose locally advanced cervical cancer stage IB2/ IIA with-positive para-aortic lymph node stage IIB/IIIB/IVA positive lymph node . II . To determine feasibility treatment regimen four cycle adjuvant ipilimumab MTD estimate . III . To assess toxicity treatment regimen per National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine progression free survival 1 year study completion . II . To determine site recurrence , loco-regional versus distant , one year completion therapy . III . To estimate frequency chronic toxicity experience within one year completion therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To enumerate human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -subtype-specific T-cells characterize kinetics HPV-subtype-specific T-cell expansion associate chemoradiation ipilimumab treatment . II . To characterize association differential expression immune marker leukocytes human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A*0201 patient response chemoradiation ipilimumab treatment . III . To assess qualitative change maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) treatment chemoradiation ipilimumab . IV . To bank residual plasma ( obtain leukocyte process ) future research . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ipilimumab . Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , undergo external beam radiation therapy 5 day week 6 week , undergo intracavitary brachytherapy approximately 2 week . Within 2 week , patient receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 12 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
