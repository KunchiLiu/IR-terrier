	<brief_summary>Purpose : To determine effectiveness augmented Pilates program , combine multimodal strengthen program , patient age 21 , spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis . Significance topic : Spondylolysis spondylolisthesis often diagnose child adolescent present low back pain . A randomized , clinical trial , test-retest design , 3 week 6 week assessment functional performance test measure , exercise log , adherence scale patient parent perception , outcome measure ( Global rating change ( GROC ) Modified Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) ) . This study attempt obtain least 120 subject randomize two group : brace general strengthen program vs. brace Pilates/motor learn program combine general strengthen program . This study begin initial examination continue treatment session 2x/week 6 week . A follow phone call conduct 3 month complete 6-week protocol . The follow phone call oral conduct GROC ODI outcome measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Addition Pilates Program Short-Term Improvements Patients With Spondylolysis Spondylolisthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Location : Akron Children 's Hospital , Sports Medicine . For research purpose , study conclude end 6 week , however , patient meet physical therapy goal , physical therapy may continue upon collaboration patient his/her parent ( minor ) , physical therapist , refer physician . Initially , letter discus opportunity participate research study within initial intake paperwork . This allow patient parent preliminary information prior consult therapist . As customary , patient assign licensed PT initial examination . The initial examine therapist responsible discus provide patient pre-enrollment information inform consent ( estimation time need approximately 15 minute ) may obtain consent time pre-enrollment discussion start patient 's second session . Upon agreement participation study , patient able complete additional paperwork require part study ( outcome measure ) . The patient randomize self-inclusion study one two group role dice 1 , 3 , 5 intervention group 2 , 4 , 6 clinical control group . The initial examination include subjective history taking , objective assessment physical test spine include active range motion , passive range motion , strength assessment/endurance assessment lumbar musculature . The examination take approximately 45 minute 1 hour length . Description Subjects ( include age range , selection criterion , recruitment procedure , anticipate desired sample size ) - Subjects age 8-21 eligible participate study . Due inclusion vulnerable subject responsible party/parent guardian must grant inclusion must able attend initial physical therapy evaluation minor sign consent document . The physician office within surround hospital area doctor typically refer clinic notify research study ( attachment physician letter flyer facility ) . Patients include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Age subject must 8-21 year old 2 . Ability read understand English language 3 . Parent/caregiver consent 4 . Written medical diagnosis spondylolysis spondylolithesis physician without image . The investigator plan target maximum 120 subject large study , allow 20 % drop rate . This study power n=100 subject least minimal effect calculate . The investigator hypothesize minimal effect patient group receive investigational `` motor control '' Pilates base exercise compare general core strengthen program patient group . Outcome Measures : Numeric Pain Rating Scale The numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) use capture patient 's level pain . Patients ask indicate intensity current , best , bad level pain past 24 hour use 11-point scale range 0 ( `` pain '' ) 10 ( `` worst pain imaginable '' ) . The average three rating use represent patient 's level pain previous 24 hour . This procedure show adequate reliability , validity , responsiveness patient LBP minimally clinical important difference 2-point change patient mechanical low back pain . Global Rating Change Scale At follow-up evaluation , patient complete global rating change ( GROC ) . Patients rate overall perception improvement since begin treatment scale range -7 ( great deal worse ) zero ( ) +7 ( great deal well ) . It recommend score GROC ±3 ±1 represent small change ; score ±4 ±5 represent moderate change , score ±6 ±7 large change . The Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire ( ODI ) The Modified ODI self-administered questionnaire require 5 minute complete 1 minute score . Scores associate degree disability range minimal bedbound . The ODI condition-specific disability scale patient LBP , consist 10 item address different aspect function , score 0-5 high value represent great disability . This modify ODI find high level reliability , validity , responsiveness . The MCID ODI identify six point .On scale , 0-20 equates minimal disability , 20-40 moderate disability , 40-60 severe disability , 60-80 cripple , 80-100 bed-bound exaggerating . Physical Endurance Tests/Measures McGill establish performance test examine endurance profile healthy young men woman spine stabilize musculature . Given grow support quantification endurance , data endurance time ratios extensor , flexor , lateral flexor group healthy normal subject useful patient evaluation provide clinical train target . To establish isometric endurance hold time , well ratio torso extensor , flexor , lateral flexor ( stabilizer ) , clinical assessment rehabilitation target . The test prove reliable , reliability coefficient &gt; .97 repeat test 5 consecutive day 8 week later .</detailed_description>
