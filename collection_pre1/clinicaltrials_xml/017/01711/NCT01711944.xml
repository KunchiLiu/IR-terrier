The investigator also immediately broaden scope user include father eligible participant study new delivery paradigm investigator believe find appeal . Aim 1 implementation engaging , easy-to-use on-line version Bright IDEAS would available 24/7 person anywhere access Internet . Aim 2 use `` Diffusion Innovations '' theory craft framework disseminate Bright IDEAS similar intervention great effectiveness efficiency . In past study , investigator show human element ( time attention ) inherent in-person intervention effective bring immediate relief distress sufficient maintain benefit time . In contrast , mother receive PSST increase skill continue improve sense well-being 3 month intervention .
