	<brief_summary>Viral hepatitis serious world health problem affect 1 billion people worldwide . Presently lack highly effective treatment result many patient require liver transplantation death . The investigator define role unique molecule FGL2 receptor fc-gammaR role pathogenesis experimental human hepatitis . The study propose present proposal test hypothesis measuring level fgl2 plasma identify individual go develop chronic disease inhibition bind fgl2 receptor allow host acute chronic disease develop appropriate immune response clear virus . The study provide rationale generation new therapy improve treatment patient acute chronic viral hepatitis target fgl2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role FGL2-FcgammaRIIB Inhibitory Pathway Human Viral Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection affect 200 million individual worldwide . Only fraction infect individual clear virus , whereas majority ( 70 % ) develop chronic infection . The current standard care , pegylated interferon/ ribavirin ( pegIFN/rib ) effective 50 % patient . Patients fail anti-viral therapy gradually progress end-stage liver disease hepatocellular cancer ; cure liver transplant . The reason treatment failure unclear involve viral host factor . One significant factor may impair T cell function . Chronic HCV infection associate functionally impaired exhaust cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTLs ) , decrease anti-viral cytokine production , cytotoxicity proliferative capacity . The investigator recently show many patient fail treatment elevated frequency CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) produce novel fibrinogen-like-protein 2 ( FGL2/fibroleukin ) appear impair HCV specific immune response . Binding FGL2 FcγRIIB receptor lead inhibition dendritic cell ( DC ) maturation , B cell apoptosis inhibition development effective CD4+and CD8+T B cell anti-viral response . In HCV , increase level secrete FGL2 may suppress anti-viral immune response promote disease progression . Hypothesis : HCV suppress innate adaptive anti-viral immune response FGL2-FcγRIIB inhibitory pathway . Inhibition pathway restore effective virus-specific immunity lead successful viral eradication . Significance : These study establish importance FGL2-FcγRIIB inhibitory pathway pathogenesis HCV chronic infection provide novel therapeutic approach improve virus eradication long term patient outcome .</detailed_description>
