	<brief_summary>Sunitinib oral drug use treatment advanced kidney cancer . The standard dose 50mg , many patient require dose decrease due side-effects . Drug level sunitinib vary approximately 10-fold patient . This study measure blood level sunitinib metabolite , correlate side-effects response treatment . The study aim establish whether blood level change time , see useful blood level monitor patient treated sunitinib .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Sunitinib oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor use first-line systemic therapy metastatic renal cell carcinoma . It metabolise pharmacologically active metabolite , SU012662 , equal potency parent compound . At standard 50mg daily dose , variability plasma level patient approximately ten-fold . In clinical trial , 30 % patient require dose reduction due toxicity . However , patient tolerate 100mg without excessive toxicity . It unknown sunitinib clearance change time . Pre-clinical experiment observe tyrosine kinase inhibition plasma concentration 50-100ng/ml . Design : This prospective non-randomized , Phase II clinical study . Decision treat patient single-agent sunitinib pre-determined treating specialist enter study . Toxicity trough sunitinib/metabolite level measure every six week treatment . Aim : This study prospectively examine relationship steady-state trough level sunitinib/metabolites time treatment , addition change trough level time . Trough level also correlate measure efficacy treatment-related toxicity . Furthermore , aim confirm putative target 50ng/ml correlate toxicity time sunitinib .</detailed_description>
