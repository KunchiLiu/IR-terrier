	<brief_title>Study Metabolic Syndrome Use Omega-3 Fatty Acids Low Fat Meal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome common condition different degree hypertension , impair glucose tolerance , atherogenic dyslipidemia , central fat accumulation , well prothrombotic proinflammatory state cluster together individual . The modified National Cholesterol Education Program , Adult Treatment Panel III guideline define metabolic syndrome subject individual 3 follow criterion : 1 . Waist circumference : male ≥90 cm female ≥80 cm 2 . Raised triglyceride : &gt; 150 mg/dL 3 . Reduced HDL cholesterol : &lt; 40 mg/dL male , &lt; 50 mg/dL female 4 . Raised blood pressure : systolic blood pressure &gt; 130 diastolic blood pressure &gt; 85 mmHg 5 . Raised fast plasma glucose : ( FPG ) &gt; 100 mg/dL Changes macronutrient composition use promote weight loss enhance insulin sensitivity , independent emphasis overall calorie ingestion . Protective effect fish intake development insulin resistance report prospective epidemiological study . Further , long chain omega-3 PUFAs supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity patient impair glucose tolerance patient T2DM . However , clearly demonstrate intervention trial Taiwan . Furthermore , effect supplementation long chain omega-3 PUFAs metabolic risk factor insulin resistance , except demonstrated benefit term decrease triglyceride , need investigation among Asians . This 13-week , randomize control study assign approximately 200 subject meet criterion Metabolic Syndrome ( 50 ) follow four arm 1 ) Standard Taiwan Diet plan ; 2 ) Herbalife meal replacement diet program ( Low fat diet ) ; 3 ) Standard Taiwan Diet plan plus healthy oil supplement ( Herbalifeline® ) 4 ) Herbalife meal replacement plan ( Low fat diet ) plus healthy oil supplement ( Herbalifeline® ) . All participant meet registered dietitian assist diet effort . In study , aim study effect low fat diet reduce omega-6 PUFAs alone low fat diet omega-3 fatty acid supplementation cardiometabolic profile circulate fatty acid profile subject metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
