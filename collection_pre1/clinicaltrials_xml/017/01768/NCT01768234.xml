	<brief_summary>There large body evidence adult population suggest cognition adult affect hydration status . The study conduct global North population schoolchildren indicate drinking water impact pupil performance basic cognitive task . No study assess impact dehydration cognition schoolchildren carry global South , access water poor dehydration prevalence likely higher . This study examine effect drink supplementary water school day hydration status cognitive test score schoolchildren Mali , West Africa . The investigator hypothesize provide supplemental water result decrease prevalence dehydration study group result improve performance cognitive test score . Data collect four purposively-selected school Sikasso region Mali , total 300 child . At school pupil grade 3-6 eligible recruitment . Research staff explain study pupils school individually request informed oral assent participation . A waiver parental consent pupil interview secure Ministry Education . At school , school director ask sign loco parentis ( `` place parent '' ) behalf pupil participant . Children assent participate study randomly allocate intervention control group . Data collection take place school two day within one-week period , one study group test two day . On intervention test day , study participant receive supplementary water . On control test day , study participant receive supplementary water . Testing procedure group identical include five-minute interview , two cognitive test session 45 minute , collection two urine sample day . None activity collect personal data identifier , urine sample store . All data collection occur school conduct trained local enumerator . There risks participation small amount class time miss pupil , great effort make minimize time outside class .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dehydration Among School Children- Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Specific Aims The purpose study evaluate impact improved water access cognitive performance mood primary school child West Africa . There considerable body research assess link dehydration reduction cognitive ability mood , study involve child one study take place outside Europe . UNICEF estimate 47 % school low-income setting access water day . Emory researcher recently quantify impact improved water , sanitation , hygiene ( WASH ) access school health education measure . A good understanding impact water intake hydration importance grow number school-based WASH intervention develop country , purpose pure scientific knowledge also advocacy donor national government . To purpose , investigator identify follow objective : - Refine battery cognitive test child low-income setting ; - Assess level dehydration among child poor arid setting ; - Quantify effect improved water access hydration status cognition ; - Compare different field hydration assessment technique accuracy ease use Study significance Data collect research contribute new evidence use school WASH intervention program international advocacy , well provide significant groundbreaking evidence improve water quantity school . There increase body evidence impact improved school WASH condition reduce school absence , parasitic infection , diarrheal disease . However , precise mechanism improve educational attainment yet fully explore . Linking drinking water availability directly cognitive skill would provide one explanatory mechanism . School inclusion criterion This study involve child grade 3-6 attend primary school Sikasso , Mali . - No water point access within 2 km - Within 1.5 hour drive Bamako . - Program activity commence school Setting Data collection activity take place four primary school . Paper cognitive test questionnaire administer research staff pupils inside classroom , supervision classroom instructor . Surveys take informed assent conduct private space outside classroom . Procedures subject Data collection procedure identical day data collection follow general , may slightly modify account specific school schedule . Morning ( *Denotes Day 1 activity ) - 7:30 - 8:00 Class description study* ( Group set ) - 8:00 - 8:45 Pupil assent process* , screening* , interview , urine sample collection ( One-by-one ) . Afternoon - 2:00 - 2:30 Urine sample collection ( One-by-one ) - 2:30-3:15 Cognitive test + self-report scale ( Group set ) Data collection activity Pupil interview . The pupil interview conduct prior collect morning urine sample group 's respective testing day . It contain question drink eat habit school home . Pupils excuse class complete interview one time , immediately follow interview ask provide urine sample return class . Urine sample collection . Pupils ask provide one urine sample morning one urine sample afternoon day data collection respective group . Pupils provide urine sample container mark unique ID , give instruction collect sample . They return sample study staff , assess hydration site dispose sample . If latrine available site , private location pupil provide sample set . Pupils always allow provide sample alone . Study staff provide water soap handwash pupil wash hand give urine sample . In morning , urine sample collect immediately follow pupil interview . In afternoon , urine sample collect immediately prior commence cognitive testing . Cognitive test + self-report scale . Cognitive test paper-based administered group set classroom train study enumerator . Schoolteachers administrator ask leave classroom test period . Each pupil provide booklet contain set cognitive test self- assessment scale thirst , mood , perceive difficulty . Cognitive test self- assessment scale administer morning afternoon study staff . Total testing time session estimate maximum 45 minute . Hydration status measure Hydration status measure urinalysis use three method : urine specific gravity , urine color , self-reported thirst . The urine sample use assess urine specific gravity color site . Study staff record measurements discard sample . Pupils self-report thirst twice day test ( morning afternoon ) use scale contain within cognitive test booklet . Cognitive test performance measure Cognitive performance assess series seven simple test assess broad range cognitive skill , adapt past research carry child Israel United Kingdom . All cognitive assessment adapt specifically Mali context prior data collection , local enumerator train administration test . The investigator collaborate implement partner translate test instruction local language need pre-test ensure tool appropriate study context . All test paper-based test score manually . Risks participation There minimal risk participation study . The big risk participation lose class time . Participation study subject participant excess risk two interruption class time 30-45 minute , single interruption 5 minute complete individual interview , time take provide urine sample . All activity design minimize time take away class instruction , effort make cause disruption . Study staff ensure head teacher , teacher , pupil participant fully understand performance cognitive test affect grade , urine sample discard . Response booklet store locked office , data enter secure database . No personal identifying information keep data . Benefits subject future benefit The direct benefit participation study participant provide drinking water one school day . There direct benefit participant know information gain study contribute knowledge educational health impact improve WASH school . The information share local stakeholder potential use advocacy tool future program area build upon work do program . Data analysis Results survey , cognitive test , urine sample enter password-protected excel database . The database export appropriate statistical analysis software file . Paired t-tests conduct compare change test score baseline follow-up different group ( e.g. , water vs. water ; dehydrate vs. hydrate ) . Data management monitoring This trial entail medical intervention kind ; therefore , typical data safety monitoring plan necessary . Study staff instruct monitor unforeseen situation suggest increase risk participant immediately inform study manager decision make mitigate risk . Confidentiality Pupils assign unique identifier start data collection . Stickers identifier place pupil test material . A list link identifier pupil create assist data collection logistics course data collection period ; however , list dispose data collection period end . No personal identifying information collect part study . No personal identifier keep database . All sample destroy leave study site sample bank part study . Informed Consent A waiver parental consent pupil data collection secure government authority body Ministry Education . In local setting , sign consent also obtain school management committee ( SMC ) , absence , school director . In Mali , SMC empower oversee management activity school , behalf community school serf . At school , SMC chairperson school director ( appropriate ) ask sign loco parentis ( `` place parent '' ) behalf pupil participant . The consent procedure inform school activity , purpose research , obtain permission researcher carry activity assent pupil . School director SMC chairperson would sign loco parentis form 150 pupils school . This form sign first visit , serve consent subsequent visit . One loco parentis form collect school , four total collect study ( one four school ) . All pupil subject class select participate study read complete informed oral assent script group prior data collection trained staff member . The staff member call pupil outside class one one ask question explanation give class , answer question may . They ask pupil assent , record assent list pupil . While study explain class group , actual pupil assent take private setting appearance coercion classmates teacher . Once pupil assent , study staff member commence screen test . If pupil pass test , study staff administer pupil questionnaire . Once questionnaire complete , pupil give collection cup ask provide sample . Oral assent chosen rather write due varying level literacy school well desire minimize paperwork contain participant ' name . A maximum 150 assent record study school , maximum 300 total pupil assent record course study .</detailed_description>
