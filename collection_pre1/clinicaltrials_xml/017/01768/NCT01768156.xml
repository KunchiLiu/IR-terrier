	<brief_summary>HE4 new marker could improve detection ovarian cancer . The HE4 assay may advantage CA-125 assay less frequently positive patient non malignant disease . Since evaluation HE4 detection diagnosis ovarian cancer well know , behaviour marker chemotherapy follow-up period treatment metastatic ovarian cancer study . It could use patient non CA-125 secretary tumor . Prognosis predictive value HE4 compare information provide CA-125 . The kinetics HE4 value treatment also analyse determine role HE4 could play detection recurrence follow-up metastatic patient .</brief_summary>
