	<brief_title>The Family Cognitive Adaptation Training Manual : A Test Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efforts address cognitive impact schizophrenia broadly define fall either compensatory restorative category . Restorative intervention , cognitive remediation , show promise reduce cognitive deficit improve functional outcome ( McGurk et al. , 2007 ) . In contrast , compensatory approach Cognitive Adaptation Training work around cognitive deficit change client 's natural environment support improve functioning . These compensatory strategy serve bypass cognitive deficit negative symptom organize belonging create reminder environmental cue support specific adaptive behavior . An example include individual packaging clothes worn day , simplify process choose wear decrease likelihood client impulsively put many clothes otherwise dress manner good fit climate social setting ( Draper et al. , 2009 ; Maples &amp; Velligan , 2008 ) . Cognitive Adaptation Training ( CAT ) manualized intervention develop help individual compensate cognitive deficit associate schizophrenia . CAT intervention commence neuropsychological assessment client determine best profile strategy implement specific cognitive classification within person place . Interventions base two dimension 1 ) level executive functioning ( determined score set neurocognitive test ) 2 ) whether behaviour individual characterize apathy ( poverty speech movement difficulty initiate behaviour ) , disinhibition ( distractibility impulsivity ) combination two . Clinicians develop implement individualized set strategy address key domain hygiene , safety , dress , medication . These strategy alter strengths weakness area attention , memory , fine motor skill . For example , someone poor attention , colour sign change regularly florescent colour use capture attention . For someone memory problem ( particularly good auditory attention ) audiotape use sequence behaviour . CAT intervention establish maintain home monthly weekly visit CAT therapist/trainer intervention typically last 9 month trial take place date Outcomes randomize trial CAT promising . Compared control condition , client receive CAT low level symptomatology , low relapse rate , high level adaptive functioning , good quality life , good medication adherence ( Velligan et al. , 2000 ; 2002 ; 2007 ; 2008a ; 2008b ) . In general , CAT show beneficial individual schizophrenia vary degree type functional impairment . The support involvement family care individual schizophrenia one important contributor wellness recovery also , unfortunately , one least acknowledged component recovery process . A high proportion person severe mental illness stay touch family involvement family care associate well clinical outcome , improve quality life , less use hospitalization ( e.g. , Fischer et al. , 2008 ) . Despite evidence importance family recovery process , contribution family often adequately appreciated treatment provider , contact provider often limit . Similarly under-developed evidence-based tool assist family effort support recovery love one . It within context development family member version CAT promising avenue explore . While element CAT require otherwise optimize administration mental health professional ( e.g. , neuropsychological testing ; target intervention base upon ongoing clinical evaluation ) , many standard component CAT readily implement family member key support . Examples include CAT intervention visual reminder regard medication , arrange clean supply kitchen reinforce cleaning routine , assist use calendar scheduling . We develop tool facilitates family member implement CAT component require professional administration . The initial 'beta ' version Family CAT develop close collaboration Dr. Velligan 's team University Texas , group implement CAT CAMH site lead Dr. Kidd , CAMH Social Workers . This 'beta ' version currently process content review 6 family obtain feedback regard readily understood . Based feedback , make edits produce final version use trial propose protocol .</detailed_description>
