	<brief_summary>Various method use assess level anesthesia block spinal anesthesia . Among , ice cube , alcohol swab , needle commonly use clinical setting , ice limit difficulty management transportation , needle assessment problem owe risk pain , infection , injury patient . Hence , alcohol swab commonly use practice . However , absence pain important surgical process , assess pain block level feasible practice assess sensory nerve block level use alcohol swab . Therefore , seem good use peripheral nerve stimulator accurate assessment pain block level . This advantage continuous measurement block level , use practical manner conjunction surgical incision . Hence , author compare conventional method use alcohol swab use peripheral nerve stimulator determine method practical measurement spinal anesthesia block level .</brief_summary>
