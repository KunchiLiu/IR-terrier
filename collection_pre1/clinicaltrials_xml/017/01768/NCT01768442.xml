	<brief_summary>The investigator ' goal incorporate advance imaging information treatment planning process ass response tumor , node non-cancerous tissue head neck cancer patient concurrent chemotherapy radiation therapy ( chemoRT ) via biophysical , biochemical vascular image use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The investigator recruit 30 patient locally advanced head neck cancer study . All patient obtain advanced MRI study three time point : 1 ) start chemoRT , 2 ) 4 week follow start chemoRT , 3 ) 3-4 month follow completion chemoRT . MRI scan include ) T1 , T2 T2* imaging , b ) vascular image use dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) imaging , c ) biophysical microstructure image use diffusion-weighted imaging , ) biochemical image use MR spectroscopic imaging . The subject 's response ( tumor , node salivary mucosal tissue ) evaluate use clinical outcome . Correlations generate parameter obtain MR image clinical response assessment . The purpose study ass whether advanced MR image technique use determine tumor node response ( ) four week follow initiation concurrent chemoRT ( ii ) completion chemoRT head neck cancer , ass whether advanced MR image technique use predict early at-risk organ function ( salivary gland mucosal injury ) measure salivary flow oral mucositis chemoradiation therapy ( ) four week follow initiation concurrent chemoRT ( ii ) completion chemoRT head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MRI scan perform three time point . The time point 1-2 week prior start treatment , 4 5 week start treatment ( i.e. , 20th radiation treatment fraction start 25th radiation treatment fraction ) , 3-4 month completion chemoRT . Scans acquire first third time point clinically indicate ( except spectroscopy scan ) order treat physician . The scan session correspond second time point research purpose . The investigator choose 4-5 week time point predict early response chemoRT follow reason . In 7-week treatment regimen , indicator test &gt; 5 week would limit predictive utility consideration alternative therapy , i.e. , surgical intervention . However , indicator measure &lt; = 5 week ( i.e. , enough time remain end therapy ) might potentially inform therapeutic course action future study . If pilot study demonstrate utility advance MR image technique identify 4-5 week , future study could focus optimal timing assessment early response . The time point 3-4 month select assess post-therapy response coincides clinical follow-up schedule ( image-based assessment response perform via clinical exam and/or PET image ) determine standard care response . T1 , T2 , T2* MRI scan perform delineate head neck tissue . DCE MRI scan provide quantitative assessment contrast uptake tissue tissue vasculature follow-up completion chemoRT . Contrast image provide gadolinium-based contrast agent ( GBCA ) . GBCA FDA-approved routinely use dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan . Further , contrast enhance MRI typically obtain cancer patient include head neck cancer part routine clinical care . Diffusion MRI scan provide information diffusion water molecule tumor , node head neck tissue . MR spectroscopy scan provide information tissue metabolite . All scan acquire prior start chemoRT provide baseline map functional map acquire completion chemoRT compare determine relative change anatomical , biophysical biochemical parameter . Image anatomy parameter map correlate dose map derive CT image register ( fuse ) MRI image CT image acquire part standard care use treatment plan subject 's radiation treatment .</detailed_description>
