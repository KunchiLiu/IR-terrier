	<brief_title>Interventional Study Improve Adherence Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Chronic Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cytogenetic hallmark chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) reciprocal translocation chromosome 9 22 create Philadelphia ( Ph ( 1 ) ) chromosome . The BCRABL1 fusion gene result translocation encode constitutively active tyrosine kinase responsible development CML . Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) target protein product aberrant gene , BCRABL-1 protein , revolutionize therapeutic approach chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Treatment first FDA approve TKI , imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec , Novartis ) , chronic phase CML result project 8 year overall survival 85 % . Recently , two second generation TKIs , Dasatinib Nilotinib , approve use newly diagnose chronic phase CML , result study show improved molecular cytogenetic outcome . Importantly , study substantial number dropout due drug intolerance resistance , among reason . In prospective observational study 169 CML patient , 14 % patient fully adherent prescribe imatinib . Moreover , one third patient consider non-adherent , similar proportion dropout landmark study TKIs CML . Thus , clear subgroup patient properly adhere treatment . This especially significant contemporary approach CML complete cytogenetic remission ( CCyR ) major molecular remission ( MMR ) necessitate long-term , chronic treatment TKIs . Therefore , although hematologist luxury armamentarium highly effective drug , one challenging aspect treat CML management non-compliance TKI treatment . TKI-induced adverse effect one wide spectrum reason non-adherence TKI treatment . Recently several study demonstrate prognostic importance adhere imatinib treatment . In pivotal study 87 chronic phase CML ( CP-CML ) patient CCyR , adherence rate &gt; 90 % strongly correlate 6 year probability achieve MMR ( 94.5 % vs. 28.4 % adherence rate ≤ 90 % ) . Non-adherence imatinib treatment also adversely affect event free survival associate loss CCyR patient long term treatment . These data support intuitive concept CML effectively treat drug currently available , long patient adhere treatment . Moreover , non-adherence imatinib treatment associate increased economic burden healthcare cost . Consequently , TKI adherence attractive potential target intervention . Non-adherence medication intricate problem influence physician , healthcare system , economic social factor . Other medical discipline assess various mode improve adherence therapeutic regimen , vary success . A recent study assess adherence-related behavior among CML patient , demonstrate among multitude reason non-adherence , patient forgetfulness drug side effect common cause unintentional intentional non-adherence , respectively . Several method improve adherence among patient CML retrospectively assess Moon et al . Subjects intervention arm likely receive prescription imatinib receive standard care ( 98.2 ± 0.03 % vs. 79.3 ± 0.16 % ) . Although difference adherence prescribe treatment two group , overall compliance , composite endpoint two outcome , markedly improve intervention group ( ( 93.0 ± 2.3 % vs. 76.2 ± 7.4 % , P = 0.001 ) . Recently , Gater et al conceive conceptual model aim improve adherence CML patient treat 1st 2nd generation TKIs , base systematic review literature . However , currently prospective data evaluate whether adherence CML influence active intervention . Study Hypothesis : Adherence tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) associate improved outcome chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) patient . Hence , improve adherence might improve CML patient ' prognosis . The investigator hypothesize adherence-encouraging intervention improve adherence TKIs CML patient . Study Objective : 1 . Primary Objective : By mean prospective before-after study , investigator aim ass whether specific adherence-encouraging intervention improve TKI adherence patient CP-CML treat agent . The investigator target previously document reason non-adherence 11 intervention select base prior experience medical discipline evaluate contribution patient ' adherence treatment . 2 . To good understand non-adherence CML pinpoint independent risk factor non-adherence 3 . To validate questionnaire assess adherence , evaluate whether could use indentifying patient risk non-adherence 4 . To compare adherence second generation TKIs adherence imatinib 5 . To assess role clinical pharmacist prevent potential drug interaction 6 . To determine whether intervention long term effect adherence one year post-intervention follow 7 . To estimate long term effect adherence clinical , cytogenetic molecular outcome</detailed_description>
