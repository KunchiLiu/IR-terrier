	<brief_summary>Parkinson disease ( PD ) characterize substantial disability reduce quality life , attribute large part difficulty walk . Evidence suggest exercise may important addition traditional treatment , particularly respect address walk problem . In particular , dance treadmill train individually show improve walk performance quality life . At present clear whether dance treadmill train similar effect one superior . Furthermore , understand mean exercise intervention convey benefit extremely limited . This study aim address knowledge gap directly compare dance , treadmill train stretch ( control group ) . The primary area interest effect gait , secondary measure disease severity , balance , quality life . The investigator determine effect intervention walk performance , also investigate effect intervention connection different part brain brain function imagine walk task use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Participants randomly assign dance , treadmill training , stretching/flexibility control group . Participants assess period 6 month 3 different time point . The investigator hypothesize dance treadmill train lead improvement forward walk , dance result great improvement backward walk compare treadmill training . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize tango treadmill intervention different effect brain function brain connection . The investigator expect dance enhance activity connection particular brain region treadmill train enhance activity connection different brain region . The investigator expect change brain activity connection control group .</brief_summary>
