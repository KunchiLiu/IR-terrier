Subjects randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment intervention . 4 ) All activity include study consider research would normally part treatment subject receive VAPSHCS . Details various study activity include : Informed Consent A research staff member review detail study subject answer question subject may , see subject interested participating . Subjects print name , sign date study consent form interested participating . Assessments There several assessment require part subject ' participation study : cognitive test , baseline assessment interview , four `` assessment period '' .
