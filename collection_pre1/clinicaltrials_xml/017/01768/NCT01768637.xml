	<brief_summary>Higher coronary in-stent thromboses bleed complication anti-platelet agent common Chronic Kidney Disease vs. non-Chronic Kidney Disease patient . Poor inhibition platelet aggregation anti-platelet agent predict future cardiovascular event . Clinical practice guideline ambiguous use agent Chronic Kidney Disease due lack control study . The investigator hypothesize patient Chronic Kidney Disease compare non-Chronic Kidney Disease reduce platelet aggregation poor platelet inhibitory response aspirin . The aim 1 ) define range whole blood platelet aggregation stag 3-5 Chronic Kidney Disease patient ; 2 ) investigate whether patient stage 4-5 Chronic Kidney Disease vs. non-Chronic Kidney Disease low platelet aggregation impair von Willebrand Factor activity ; 3 ) compare inhibition platelet aggregation baseline 2 week aspirin therapy another 2 week clopidogrel therapy add aspirin Chronic Kidney Disease vs. non-Chronic Kidney Disease patient . Accomplishing aim provide pilot data power future study target anti-platelet agent treatment Chronic Kidney Disease order improve cardiovascular outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients consent study ask initial consent form state whether agree genetic testing . After sign informed consent , complete medical history medication list obtain verified electronic medical record . After meet inclusion exclusion criterion screen visit , patient aspirin primary prevention cardiovascular event ask stop 2 week prior blood collection baseline data . Normal control chosen frequency match decade age , gender , diabetes mellitus interval body mass index ( 5 kg/m2 ) . Dietary supplement ( Vitamin E fish oil ) known affect platelet function assess patient ask discontinue . Participants also ask eat food know affect platelet function ( coffee , chocolate , grape , alcohol ) 48 hour prior sample collection visit 1 . An interviewer-administered assessment diet exercise modify 24-hour dietary recall Stanford 7-day Physical activity Recall perform ensure dietary consistency may affect platelet aggregability visit 1 . Blood drawn via venopuncture laboratory study ( whole blood platelet aggregation , von Willebrand Factor antigen level activity ) . Participants administer aspirin 81 mg 2 week ask return 2 week . On visit 2 , whole blood platelet aggregation re-measured questionnaire fill . Two oral swab take participant consent genetic testing sample store Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center short term ship Diagnostics Laboratory genetic test clopidogrel cytochrome P450 polymorphism . All participant administer clopidogrel 75 mg daily top aspirin 81 mg 2 week ask return 2 week . On visit 3 , whole blood platelet aggregation re-measured questionnaire fill . At completion study , participant place back original antiplatelet agent applicable refer back primary care provider .</detailed_description>
