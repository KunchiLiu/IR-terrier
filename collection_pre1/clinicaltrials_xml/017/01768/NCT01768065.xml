	<brief_title>Nasal Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure Treatment Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The nasal expiratory positive airway pressure ( NEPAP ) device use treat OSAS adult . A disposable device place nostril night attach adhesive . The device act one-way valve , inspiration valve open , negligible resistance flow . During expiration , valve close airflow direct small air channel , increase resistance . The increased resistance help maintain upper airway pressure critical end-expiratory period upper airway find narrow breath precede apnea event . In contrast Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) provide positive pressure inspiration expiration , NEPAP create pressure expiration . NEPAP potential alternative therapy less cumbersome CPAP may increase adherence .</detailed_description>
