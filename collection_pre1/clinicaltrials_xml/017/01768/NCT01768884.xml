	<brief_summary>Prospective , Double Blind , Randomized Single-Center , Evaluation Safety Tolerability Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently via Inhalation Subjects Bronchiolitis-Phase IIa Bronchiolitis define infection small airway . It also common manifestation acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) early infancy , lead cause global child mortality . NO show play critical role various biological function , include vasodilatation smooth muscle , neurotransmission , regulation wound heal immune response infection microbicidal action direct toward various organism . NO airways consider play key role innate immune system first-line host defense microbe build . It show beneficial effect NO different disease several option dos regimens - newborn primary pulmonary hypertension show improvement oxygenation 30 minute NO treatment 10-20 ppm , subject adult respiratory distress syndrome , demonstrate clinical improvement NO treatment 18 36 ppm . In vitro study utilize variety nitric oxide ( NO ) donor suggest NO , part per million ( ppm ) concentration , possess antimicrobial anti-viral activity wide variety phylum include bacteria , virus , helminthes parasite . Primary Objectives : Assess safety NO intermittent inhalation treatment 2-12 month old bronchiolitis subject . Assess tolerability NO intermittent inhalation treatment 2-12 month old bronchiolitis subject Secondary Objective : Assess efficacy NO intermittent inhalation treatment compare standard treatment 2-12 month old bronchiolitis subject . Prospective , double blind , randomize single-Center study 44 hospitalized subject age 2 -12 month old , diagnose bronchiolitis enrol study randomize 2 group . Group 1 -Treatment group - Will receive nitric oxide inhalation addition standard treatment 5 day , Group 2 - receive ongoing inhalation standard treatment 5 day . Treatment administration : Treatment blindness keep separate unblinded team member ( give actual treatment ) blind team member , hide NO container study relate equipment behind curtain . Between study inhalation subject continue receive standard inhalation treatment . Oxygen ( O2 ) , NO , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) deliver patient continuously monitor . All subject come follow visit day 7 ( +5 ) , 14 ( +5 ) day contact day 30 ( +5 ) day admission department . End study treatment ( group ) assess blind study physician base clinical assessment . Subject improvement lead end study treatment = clinical score &lt; 6 and/or ( Oxygen saturation ) SaO2 92 % and/or decision subject discharge hospital .</brief_summary>
