	<brief_summary>The investigator plan use optical brain image technology observe patient current major depression , , repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) clinical treatment . Clinical treatment involve 20-30 rTMS session course 4-6 week . Our primary hypothesis follow : 1 . Primary Hypothesis : In patient positive response rTMS , investigator observe increase strength connectivity measure fMRI among brain region cognitive control network 4 week treatment . 2 . Secondary Hypothesis : Brain activation measure functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) rTMS increase number treatment increase . Detection increase brain activity begin treatment help researcher physicians assess treatment response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Brain Imaging Study Response Repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) Treatment Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE ( include progress report preliminary study ) . 1 . Historical background Repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation ( rTMS ) use extensively treat patient major depression [ 1 ] . However , efficacy varies . Biomarkers quantify , objectively ass , even predict efficacy rTMS treatment patient necessary order establish effective individualized treatment , well save cost time . TMS noninvasive technique stimulates brain use externally apply magnetic field induce electric current surface cortex without cause pain . rTMS use treat depression close 20 year , FDA recently approve use rTMS 2007 treatment . 2 . Previous pre-clinical clinical study lead , support propose research Despite potential , rTMS limitation variable rate effectiveness [ 1 , 2 ] . It require daily on-site treatment duration 4-6 week , commonly pay private patient fund . Therefore , need assess efficacy rTMS objectively accurately . Importantly , patient would benefit ability predict likely outcome treatment ( 4-6 week ) within first session . Thus , investigator propose study two correspond biomarkers employ two image modality , functional MRI ( fMRI ) functional near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) . Success project result identification quantitative biomarkers responsive rTMS treatment depression predict outcomes . This greatly improve individualize treatment depression future . 3 . Rationale behind propose research , potential benefit patient and/or society Unlike functional activation study , mainly focus brain region isolation , functional connectivity study quantify dynamic interaction functionally related brain region . This likely relevant complex psychiatric disorder major depression . Resting state ( RS ) network activity reflect intrinsic brain function absence task . It show remarkable overlap pattern task-induced activity [ 3 ] . The main benefit use RS fMRI investigate effect psychiatric disorder brain ass brain state , rather response complicate experimental task . This especially critical study patient depression , since trademark disease lack willingness participate activity . There mount evidence atypical RS functional network activity depression [ 2 , 4- 6 ] . Among network , cognitive control network ( CCN ) particularly important due role mood regulation attention . Because , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , important part CCN , target standard rTMS treatment . Thus critical understand change CCN rTMS treatment ; could use clinical marker efficacy treatment . RS fMRI advantageous assessment efficacy rTMS treatment : brain-based , objective potentially specific . fNIRS noninvasive optical imaging tool , measure oxy- , deoxy- , total hemoglobin concentration change ( Δ [ HbO ] , Δ [ Hb ] Δ [ tHb ] , respectively ) cortex intact skull [ 7 ] . fNIRS ideal accompaniment rTMS research , : 1 . The instrumentation immune magnetic field change 2 . It sensitive brain region affect rTMS 3 . It wide temporal dynamic range ( ms hour ) , allow measurement single TMS pulse well entire rTMS session 4 . The probe hardware compact adaptable measurement make without affect rTMS equipment placement Recently , various lab demonstrate ability fNIRS monitor effect rTMS healthy subject [ 8 , 9 ] . In study , patient receive rTMS part clinical treatment depression monitor 30 session . Investigators focus correlation change hemodynamic response session session final outcome , especially correlation hemodynamic change first session treatment outcome . This help u understand early trend hemodynamic response rTMS predict long-tern effectiveness . II . SPECIFIC AIMS ( Research Objectives ) . Specify objectives hypothesis test research project In proposal , investigator employ two image modality assess quantitatively rTMS treatment establish early biomarker predict outcome exploring : 1 . The RS functional connectivity within 10 day within 10 day course treatment ( 30 treatment ; however , typical course treatment likely one treatment 5 time week 4-6 week : total 20 session ) use blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI ( BOLD fMRI ) . 2 . The real time hemodynamic response brain rTMS treatment session use fNIRS . A number study report decrease functional connectivity CCN subject major depression [ 4-6 ] . Furthermore , study indicate DLPFC , major part CCN , exhibit relatively low activation depression . To end , specific hypothesis follow : 1 . Primary Hypothesis : In patient positive response rTMS , investigator observe increase strength connectivity measure fMRI among brain region CCN 4 week treatment . 2 . Secondary Hypothesis : Brain activation measure fNIRS DLPFC rTMS increase number treatment increase . Detection increase brain activity begin treatment may marker positive treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
