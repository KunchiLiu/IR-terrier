	<brief_title>Optimizing Triage Hospitalisation In Adult General Medical Emergency Patients : TRIAGE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients present emergency department ( ED ) currently face inacceptable delay initial treatment , long costly hospital stay due suboptimal initial triage . Accurate ED triage focus initial treatment priority , also prediction medical risk nursing need improve site care decision simplify early discharge management . Different triage score propose , Manchester Triage Score ( MTS ) . Yet , score focus treatment priority , suboptimal performance lack validation Swiss Health care system . Because MTS introduce clinical routine Kantonsspital Aarau , propose large prospective cohort study optimize initial patient triage . Specifically , aim trial derive three part triage algorithm well predict ( ) treatment priority ; ( b ) medical risk thus need inhospital treatment ; ( c ) post-acute care need patient 's proximal time point ED admission . Methods / Design : Prospective , observational , cohort study . We include consecutive medical patient seek ED care observational registry . There exclusion except non-adult non-medical patient . Vital sign record leave blood sample store later batch analysis blood marker . Upon ED discharge , post-acute care score record . Attending ED physician adjudicate triage priority base available result time discharge . Patients reassess daily hospital course medical nursing stability . To assess outcome , data electronic medical record use patient contact 30 day hospital admission ass vital status , rehospitalisation quality life measure . We aim include 5000 7000 patient one year recruitment derive three part triage algorithm . The respective main endpoint define ( ) initial triage priority ( high vs. low priority ) adjudicate attend ED physician ED discharge , ( b ) adverse 30 day outcome ( death intensive care unit admission ) within 30 day follow ED admission ass patient risk thus need inhospital treatment ( c ) care need hospital discharge , define transfer patient post-acute care institution , early recognition plan post-acute care need . Other outcomes time first physician contact , time initiation adequate medical therapy , length hospital stay , patient 's satisfaction care overall hospital cost . Discussion : Using reliable initial triage system estimate initial treatment priority , need inhospital treatment post-acute care need innovative persuasive approach target management medical patient ED . Our group prove feasibility track record several complete ongoing trial . The proposed interdisciplinary project unprecedented potential improve initial triage decision optimize resource allocation sick patient admission discharge . The algorithm derive study compare later randomize control trial usual care control group term resource use , length hospital stay , overall cost patient 's outcome term mortality , rehospitalisation , quality life satisfaction care .</detailed_description>
