	<detailed_description>1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) pancreatitis define development epigastric pain radiate back accompany either increase pancreatic enzyme ( amylase lipase ) great three time upper limit normal cross sectional image show inflammation gland . Based length hospitalization categorize mild ( 2-3 day ) , moderate ( 4-10 day ) , severe ( &gt; 10 day ) . Cases complicate hemorrhage , pseudocyst , phlegmon formation require percutaneous intervention surgery also score severe . Post ERCP pancreatitis lead complication biliary endoscopic procedure could potentially lead considerable morbidity . The overall incidence ERCP pancreatitis range 5 % community 15 % center advance ERCP include pancreatic intervention perform . Proposed mechanism include protease free radical mediate inflammation , abnormal sphincter oddi pressure , elevate pancreatic exocrine activity . Measures prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis aim curb process . Numerous trial study use various preventive therapy include octreotide protease inhibitor part disappoint . There twenty clinical trial examine efficacy somatostatin octreotide inhibit pancreatic exocrine stimulation . A meta-analysis nine high quality trial somatostatin show overall medication reduce post ERCP pancreatitis . Gabexylate mesylate ulnistatin inhibit pancreatic protease also show significantly reduce post ERCP pancreatitis . Numerous study also show corticosteroid diminish likelihood post-ERCP pancreatitis . The mainstay treatment acute pancreatitis independent origin aggressive hydration . The rationale hypovolemia microvascular hypoperfusion critical development pancreatic necrosis . In animal model demonstrate pancreatic blood flow decrease set pancreatitis . Regions hypoperfusion correlate region severe histologic inflammation . Studies fluid resuscitation patient interstitial pancreatitis demonstrate treated inadequate fluid resuscitation increase risk develop pancreatic necrosis . Several high profile study demonstrate aggressive early fluid resuscitation order 3.4-4.6 liter first 24 hour , particularly use lactate ringer associate significantly reduce mortality . In well do retrospective study Reddy et al demonstrated patient high risk post ERCP pancreatitis ( early sign ) manage aggressive fluid resuscitation protocol ( define D5 Â½ NS 200cc/hour IV ) significantly improve clinical course compare manage accord protocol.12 Among high risk patient manage accord protocol 12.5 % developed moderate severe pancreatitis , compare 61.6 % manage accord protocol . The respective median length hospitalization 3 day compare 7 day . In propose study intervention prophylactically treat random group patient undergo ERCP standard therapy post ERCP pancreatitis , fluid , effort prevent development . As safeguard 2 hour procedure ( anesthesia procedure typically clear ) patient evidence pancreatitis cross treatment arm . The major potential adverse outcome could associate therapy clinical fluid overload manifest chest pain , dyspnea hypoxia well pleural effusion , peripheral edema , ascites , anasarca , pulmonary edema . We assess patient potential complication treat accordingly . The goal pilot study analyze efficacy aggressive hydration prevent post ERCP pancreatitis . Our hope stimulate interest topic clarify could possibly lead large-scale study near future . 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The primary treatment pancreatitis regardless etiology aggressive fluid resuscitation . Our long-standing aim determine whether aggressive intravenous hydration immediately ERCP decrease incidence post ERCP pancreatitis . The aim current study determine large effect appropriately power large randomized trial . 3.0 STUDY DESIGN The study prospective single blind randomize control trial consist 60 patient undergo ERCP LAC+USC Medical Center standard indication . Patients randomly assign use computer generate randomization schedule , 40 allocate treatment ( aggressive intravenous hydration ) 20 allocate standard care . This allow u examine whether rate pancreatitis usual care similar publish rate ( 15 % ) , also allow u great ability detect decrease rate attributable treatment small pilot sample . We define aggressive intravenous hydration lactate ringer ( LR ) IV 3 mL kg-1 hr-1 procedure , 20cc/kg LR IV bolus immediately afterward , LR IV 3 mL kg-1 hr-1 x 8 hour . Those control arm receive standard fluid define LR 1.5 mL kg-1 hr-1 8 hour afterwards Once patient begin receive fluid , volume status monitor assess sign fluid overload deficit require adjustment fluid resuscitation rate . Imbalances volume status monitor clinically assess tachycardia , orthostatic hypotension base blood pressure measurement , pulmonary peripheral edema . Based hydration status , adjustment make accordingly fluid resuscitation rate correct underlying problem . Numerous study attempt investigate best test available assess post-ERCP pancreatitis , since solely rely clinical presentation unreliable . Amylase level emerge reliable indicator post-ERCP pancreatitis lipase usually rise later pancreatitis result may useful early prediction post-ERCP pancreatitis.13 In study , patient assess 2 hour 8 hour procedure epigastric pain amylase sent . Epigastric pain assess use Likert scale 10 severe pain , 0 pain , value great 3 signifies moderate great pain . A cutoff great 3 used effort include patient mild transient discomfort due retain air endoscopy . The primary outcome measure post ERCP pancreatitis base patient significant epigastric pain amylase great three time upper limit normal . Those control group develop pancreatitis give 20cc/kg LR IV bolus treat LR 3cc/kg/hour . Patients develop pancreatitis fast otherwise patient start clear subsequently diet advanced tolerate . Patients develop pancreatitis follow twice daily discharge order define whether episode mild ( 2-3 day hospitalization ) , moderate ( 4-10 day hospitalization ) , severe ( &gt; 10 day hospitalization complication include hemorrhagic pancreatitis , pseudocyst , phlegmon , require percutaneous surgical procedure ) . 4.0 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS SEE ELIGIBILIBILITY SECTION 5.0 STUDY AGENT ADMINISTRATION OR INTERVENTION AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT PLAN 1 . Men woman stratify sex follow randomization treatment algorithm perform ERCP procedure . 2 . The treatment show Randomization Fluids Mode Introduction Rate procedure Post procedure Bolus Post procedure rate Time treatment post procedure ( hour ) Aggressive Hydration Lactated Ringer ( LR ) Intravenous ( IV ) 3cc/kg 20cc/kg 3cc/kg 8 Standard Hydration LR IV 1.5cc/kg None 1.5cc/kg 8 6.0 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY The major adverse outcome could associate therapy clinical fluid overload . Patients interview examine symptom sign may suggest adverse reaction include chest pain , dyspnea hypoxia well pleural effusion , peripheral edema , ascites , anasarca , pulmonary edema . All adverse event report principal investigator . These include event occur initial 24 hour procedure time afterward . The entire study team meet report adverse event biweekly basis . Reports fluid overload submit IRB . Adverse event occur trial also review another faculty physician Gastroenterology Division . 7.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS SEE ENDPOINTS SECTION 8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS We perform single blind randomize study aggressive versus standard fluid prevent post ERCP pancreatitis . While long term goal ass whether prophylactically treat patient undergo ERCP aggressive hydration decrease incidence post ERCP pancreatitis current goal ass whether study feasible assess large effect . Patients allocate standard care use test rate sample population . The primary outcome pancreatitis development within 8 hour ERCP test use Fisher 's exact chi-squared compare rate pancreatitis group . Results test allow estimation sample size fully power clinical trial . This method use test secondary aim pancreatitis first detect ( 2 hour vs 8 hour ) , though give small number participant likely develop pancreatitis ( &lt; 15 % ) primary aim comparison inform monitoring safety fully power trial . To test secondary outcome pain , repeat measure ANOVA use compare pain rating group 2 8 hour . Because pilot study , primary aim detect effect size clinical relevance outcomes.. Statistical analysis perform biostatisticians Biostatistical Bioinformatics Resource Group within SC CTSI .</detailed_description>
