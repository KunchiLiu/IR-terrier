	<brief_summary>To establish correlation location Nd : YAG laser peripheral iridotomy post operative visual symptom experience patient . The investigator hypothesize fully uncover laser peripheral iridotomy produce less significant dysphotopsia , due avoidance prismatic effect produce tear film cover .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dysphotopsia Following Laser Peripheral Iridotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nd : YAG LPI frequently perform procedure patient narrow angle risk acute angle closure glaucoma , pupillary-block condition , chronic angle closure , pigment dispersion syndrome . Most complication associated procedure benign include intraocular pressure ( IOP ) spike , transient uveitis , hyphema , corneal lens damage closure iridotomy . Visual disturbance also report paper address specific issue . The rate symptom vary 2.7 % 4 % . It believe symptom associate fact light enters LPI thus create abnormal visual symptom . Hence suggest carefully place LPI eyelid fully cover LPI , therefore prevent light get . However , report patient fully cover LPIs visual disturbance lead hypothesize theory even fully cover eyelid , light access LPI base-up prism create tear meniscus lid margin . Therefore , placement LPI , fully cover , partially cover totally uncovered potentially lead equally significant symptom . This study attempt address issue placement LPI relationship visual symptom .</detailed_description>
