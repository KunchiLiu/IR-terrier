	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Underlying Mechanisms Targeted Therapy Related Toxicities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : In past decade multiple agent target specific signal protein important tumor growth , include ( tyrosine ) kinase inhibitor , EGFR inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor BRAF inhibitor , agent modulate immune response ipilimumab , develop reach clinical approval . Initially anticipated agent would active without cause major toxicity , recent clinical experience change expectation . Diagnostic tool predict whether patient develop toxicity target agent yet available . Our general hypothesis immunophenotyping study combine ( phospho ) proteomic kinase activity profile normal tissue treatment target agent may provide insight underlie causative mechanism toxicity provide potential biomarkers clinical use predict toxicity . The investigator hypothesize target therapy- induced toxicity cause interference normal physiological homeostasis tissue level . To date , preclinical strategy predict clinical toxicity target therapy lack . This study intend ( 1 ) explore biological ( immunological ) mechanism target agent systemic local tissue level relation toxicity ( 2 ) determine off-target receptor kinase inhibition normal cell tissue related toxicity treatment ( 3 ) try identify novel biomarker ( ) predictive toxicity . Objective : The main objective pilot study determine biological impact treatment target agent systemic local tissue level relation toxicity . Study design : Single center , non-randomized , interventional pilot study feasibility analysis enrollment 20 patient . Study population : Adult patient advance solid tumor , standard palliative treatment target agent monotherapy indicate , include antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor , EGFR inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor , BRAF inhibitor ipilimumab . Intervention : Patients treat targeted therapy accord clinical standard guideline . At point , five targeted therapy considerable skin gastrointestinal toxicity reach widespread clinical use therefore `` antiangiogenic '' tyrosine kinase inhibitor , EGFR inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor , BRAF inhibitor ipilimumab investigate study . After feasibility analysis first twenty patient , twenty patient include five drug cohort . Biopsies perform determine possible immunohistochemical histopathological change normal tissue , possible immunomodulatory change express Tcell phenotyping cytokine profile compare tissue ( phospho ) proteomic kinase activity profile therapy also development toxicity . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main objective explore biological impact treatment target agent systemic local tissue level relation toxicity . This objective assess study normal tissue whether treatment target agent induce significant change normal tissue ( 1 ) histopathology , difference presence infiltrate immune cell , ( 2 ) ( phospho ) proteomic profile ( 3 ) kinase activity profile . Secondary objective ( 1 ) perform pharmacokinetics study whether serum peptide profile systemic circulate immune cell cytokine profile patient treatment target agent related toxicity ( 2 ) identify novel biomarkers predictive treatment induce toxicity base pretreatment systemic local tissue phenotype . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Enrolment study possible indication receive standard target therapy determine . Adverse event result standard treatment may occur . Biopsies skin , oral mucosa , colon mucosa prior treatment take . If toxicity develop , re-biopsy affected area take . These biopsy may cause physical discomfort . During therapy , follow-up include laboratory analysis visit outpatient clinic . Results study may provide new clue prediction treatment target therapy induced toxicity</detailed_description>
