	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate role endotracheal suction occurrence meconium aspiration syndrome depress meconium stain baby . Meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) believe result aspiration meconium consequent chemical pneumonitis . Meconium aspirate lung womb well . Meconium distal airway accessible endotracheal ( ET ) suction clear windpipe . Furthermore grow evidence support asphyxia-hypoxia-acidosis causation lung disease . Moreover , absence clear role ET suction depress meconium stain newborn , critical time could lose assessment , intubation ET suction ( range : 30 second 1 min ) might delay definitive step ventilation resuscitation baby potentially affect outcome adversely.The utility futility endotracheal suction prevent MAS depress meconium stain neonate systematically study inadequate information literature favor practice.Thus study attempt evaluate effect endotracheal suction occurrence MAS depress full term neonate bear meconium stain amniotic fluid ( MSAF ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 10-15 % delivery complicate passage meconium around time delivery.An adverse intrauterine environment resultant fetal asphyxia propose common explanation in-utero passage meconium . Aspiration meconium tracheo-bronchial tree onset respiration result meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) . MAS define respiratory distress infant bear MSAF compatible chest x-ray finding whose symptom otherwise explain . Despite current intervention intubation tracheal suction , estimate 5-20 % infant bear MSAF develop MAS . It represent lead cause perinatal morbidity . Approximately 50 % infant MAS require mechanical ventilation ; 15 % -30 % develop pulmonary air leak 5 % -12 % die . There various propose mechanism meconium cause lung injury , important one - Mechanical obstruction airways - Chemical pneumonitis - Vasoconstriction pulmonary vessel - Inactivation surfactant - Activation compliment Finding meconium cord trachea show associated development MAS . This result use endotracheal suction along oro-nasopharyngeal suctioning infant born mother MSAF prior year 2000 . Although , number study perform show reduction incidence MAS and/or mortality even perform oro-nasopharyngeal endotracheal suction , practice continue due lack robust evidence . Subsequently , result well perform randomize control trial systematic review show effect oro-nasopharyngeal suctioning occurrence MAS , practice abandon since year 2005 . ET suction currently perform depressed meconium stain neonate idea remove meconium upper airway relieve mechanical obstruction prevent subsequent development chemical pneumonitis . Since meconium aspiration occur in-utero well time aspirate meconium migrates peripherally , effectiveness ET suction post-delivery clear airway clear . Furthermore , accumulate evidence point potential role hypoxia-asphyxia-acidosis concomitant presence meconium pathogenesis lung disease . Current practice Endotracheal suction non-vigorous baby systematically evaluate , till date . No study compare incidence , severity outcome MAS 'suctioned versus non-suctioned ' non vigorous meconium stain neonate . In addition , procedure need expertise complete stipulated time potential complication like vocal cord injury , laryngeal edema , bleed upper airway secondary trauma procedure persistent hoarseness voice even six month age . The rate complication perform people lesser expertise difficult skill learn master . In view forego contribution endotracheal suction prevent MAS effect severity lung disease clear . Thus study attempt evaluate role endotracheal suction non-vigorous meconium stain neonate .</detailed_description>
