	<brief_summary>The purpose study look effectiveness give patient newly diagnose untreated early stage primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) study drug call PEGINTRON ( also know pegylated interferon alfa 2b ) . This intervention compare widely employ `` watch wait '' ( best supportive care ) approach early stage PMF , patient follow closely treatment initiated disease progress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2b Early Primary Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize one study group : one subject get treat PEGINTRON subject closely follow get best supportive care disease progression ( presently accept standard approach early disease ) . Subjects observation arm carefully monitor clinical laboratory progression disease schedule study visit . However , treat active drug like Interferon alfa others Hydroxyurea , Revlimid , Thalidomide , Pomalidomide , newly approve JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib ( Jakafi ) . If disease progress , eligible cross-over treatment arm PEGINTRON . Subjects randomized treatment arm receive PEGINTRON weekly .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet laboratory , bone marrow histological criterion primary myelofibrosis define WHO diagnostic criterion follow : WHO diagnostic criterion PMF18 Proposed Criteria PMF Major Criteria 1 . Presence megakaryocyte proliferation atypia , usually accompany either reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis , , absence significant reticulin fibrosis , megakaryocyte change must accompany increase bone marrow cellularity characterize granulocytic proliferation often decrease erythropoiesis ( ie . prefibrotic cellularphase disease ) 2 . Not meet WHO criterion PV , CML . MDS , myeloid neoplasm 3 . Demonstration JAK2617V &gt; F clonal marker ( e.g . MPL515W &gt; L/K ) , absence clonal marker , evidence bone marrow fibrosis due underlie inflammatory neoplastic disease Minor Criteria 1 . Leukoerythroblastosis 2. increase serum LDH 3 . Anemia 4 . Palpable splenomegaly Patients must Low Intermediate 1 stage disease define International Working Group ( IWG ) risk stratification primary myelofibrosis dynamic international prognostic scoring system ( DIPSS ) . In addition , must show active hematopoiesism cellularity least 15 % , irrespective degree reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis define Manoharan criteria49 . Patients NOT prior therapy primary myelofibrosis . This include treatment cytoreductive drug ( Hydroxyurea ) , immunomodulatory drug ( thalidomide , lenalidomide , pomalidomide ) , JAK2 inhibitor , therapy specifically myelofibrosis . If receive class drug indication PMF , treatment discontinue least 6 week prior randomization . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : WBC ≥ 3,000/microL ANC ≥ 1,500/microL platelet ≥ 100,000//microL total bilirubin within normal limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X upper limit normal Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50 ml/min The effect pegIFNα2b develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 6 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 6 week earlier . Patients Intermediate 2 High risk stage disease define International Working Group ( IWG ) risk stratification primary myelofibrosis dynamic international prognostic scoring system ( DIPSS ) and/or bone marrow biopsy show less 15 % cellularity presence +2 reticulin fibrosis ( Manoharan criterion ) 49 , collagen fibrosis , osteosclerosis . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pegIFNα2b Other Exclusion Criteria Female patient pregnant breast feed History depression active treatment depression History noncompliance medical regimen History autoimmune diseases History hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism Clinical evidence neuropathy Uncontrolled illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study risk unborn fetus potential risk nurse infant unknown .</criteria>
