	<detailed_description>The propose Phase II study seek build clinical data continuation original dosimetric analysis publish Ares et al . perform Paul-Scherrer Institute ( PSI ) . That comparison demonstrate benefit form proton planning patient non-metastatic breast cancer require complex , loco-regional , postoperative radiotherapy.1 The advantage PT improve target coverage compare standard photon irradiation reduce dose heart , lungs contralateral breast . The study goal demonstrate `` meaningful benefit '' proton therapy woman loco-regionally advanced breast cancer . The main clinical endpoint trial reduction cardiac morbidity mortality ( coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction , cardiac insufficiency ) reduction contralateral , second breast cancer . Both adverse event presently associate external beam photon therapy . Both goal require longitudinal follow-up minimum 5-10 year . Despite logistical challenge long term follow-up , effort need view compel preclinical evidence dose avoidance even absence radiation dose heart contralateral breast uniquely accomplishable proton .</detailed_description>
