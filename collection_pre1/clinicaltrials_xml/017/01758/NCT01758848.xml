	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder syndrome symptom . The core symptom urgency with/without urge incontinence , frequency , nocturia . The prevalence overactive bladder increase age . The elderly increasing time , people suffer overactive bladder also increase . Research related overactive bladder field physical therapy remain need . The purpose study investigate application physical therapy woman overactive bladder , emphasize effect voluntary muscle contraction urgency inhibition , include urodynamic study clinical study . There three stage study . In first stage , go develop specific health-related quality life questionnaire urinary incontinence Taiwan version . One hundred fifty woman urinary incontinence fifty healthy woman without low urinary tract symptom recruit first year investigate reliability validity questionnaire . The Short-Form 36 , Chinese version , use gold standard validity . Fifty woman urgency recruit second stage test effect muscle active contraction strategy inhibit detrusor pressure urgency . The three muscle active contraction strategy include pelvic floor muscle strong contraction , pelvic floor muscle tonic contraction , transversus abdominis tonic contraction . The outcome variable include detrusor pressure urodynamic parameter self-reported urgency score . Simultaneous image record abdominal ultrasound urodynamic examination use ensure accuracy muscle action . The predictor success strategy result second year use stratify patient third stage . Eighty woman urgency recruit final stage examine clinical effect strategy urgency inhibition .</brief_summary>
