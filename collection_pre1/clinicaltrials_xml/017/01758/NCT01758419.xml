	<brief_summary>Helical tomotherapy nowadays provide precise data radiotherapy ( RT ) dose deliver region heart left-sided breast cancer therapy , allow great spar heart dos associate increased complication . However , heart disease show wide spectrum pathology , multiple risk factor relate . The damage myocytes may lead myocardial perfusion defect , also functional deterioration , even biomarkers . In study , monitor cardiovascular ( CV ) risk factor , metabolism , biomarkers , myocardial perfusion defect pattern , cardiac functional parameter , order delineate RT-related effect clinical impact . Objective : The pilot study aim investigate correlation post-tomotherapy cardiovascular effect myocardial perfusion cardiac functional study . Methods : The study plan enroll female breast cancer patient undergo local RT surgery . Patients receive global risk score assessment ( Framingham Risk Score , FRS ) , blood sample basic biochemistry , inflammatory biomarker , myocardial perfusion image ( MPI ) time point RT . The result MPI analyze qualitative visual interpretation perfusion pattern , functional quantitative data cardiac functional parameter well . The patient regular followed-up CV OPD . The association baseline follow-up MPI , biomarker clinical presentation investigate .</brief_summary>

Groups left-sided breast cancer ( tomotherapy , conventional RT ) , right breast cancer ( conventional RT ) . 2 . Aged 20-80 year old . - Exclusion Criteria 1 . Pre-existing cardiac disease , prior myocardial infarction , document CAD , congestive heart failure . 2 . Pregnancy 3 . Any medical contraindication cardiac SPECT . - Estimated Case Number 20 female patient group , respectively Group 1 : Left-sided breast cancer , plan receive helical tomography Group 2 : Left-sided breast cancer , plan receive local conventional RT Group 3 : Right-sided breast cancer , plan receive local RT 1 . Patients breast cancer s/p operation transfer CV OPD initial cardiovascular risk factor assessment . 2 . Past history , family history , basic lab data Framingham cardiovascular risk assessment apply . Intermediated high risk need work-up , undergo SPECT RT course . 3 . All enrolled subject provide basic demographic data sign inform consent . 4 . Myocardial perfusion image baseline evaluation RT . 5 . The patient receive schedule treatment plan , include RT . 6 . Follow-up CV OPD every 3 month . 7 . Post-therapeutic myocardial perfusion study 12 month first CV OPD visit . 8 . Comparing clinical follow-up data group , include global functional assessment , blood sample data , myocardial perfusion scan , quantitative cardiac functional parameter . Blood sample Myocardial perfusion study- Patients refer SPECT MPI evaluation CAD underwent 1-day Tl-201 stress/rest MPI protocol , daily practice FEMH . Pharmacological stress induce standard dipyridomale infusion . Tl-201 2 mCi inject 7 min induce stress . Each scan perform ultrafast CZT camera ( Discovery 530 NMc , GE Healthcare ) . CZT image reconstruct workstation use dedicate iterative algorithm maximum likelihood expectation maximization . Perfusion image standard axis ( short axis , vertical long axis , horizontal long axis ) polar map leave ventricle obtain . Scans CZT analyze consensus two experience reader blind information patient identification . The software package 17-segment model leave ventricle . Automated analysis gate acquisition high-dose ( rest ) scan performed determine leave ventricular ejection fraction . Integrated clinical information , follow-up nuclear medicine cardiac scan perform time point &amp; RT collect analyze .</detailed_description>
