	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) primary disorder central nervous system may affect motor pathway cause muscle weakness . Respiratory complication due respiratory muscle weakness common terminal stage MS contribute mortality patient . Respiratory muscle weakness may also impair performance cough aspiration , pneumonia , even acute ventilatory failure may ensue . Functional magnetic stimulation ( FMS ) non-invasive method promote contraction muscle nerve activation . Over last year , study investigator demonstrate efficacy FMS technology stimulate respiratory muscle animal model , able-bodied subject [ 3 ] spinal cord injure ( SCI ) patient [ 4 ] . In study , researcher investigate efficacy use FMS technique respiratory muscle conditioning patient MS . Furthermore , investigator also compare expiration relate outcomes FMS technique resistive expiratory muscle training ( REMT ) methodology . Hypotheses 1 . FMS condition expiratory muscle generate significant expiratory flow pressure patient MS. 2 . FMS condition expiratory muscle effective compare resistive expiratory muscle training ( REMT ) patient MS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optimal respiratory function depend intact neural circuitry orchestrate interplay respiratory muscle intrinsic pulmonary function maintain adequate ventilation . In absence respiratory muscle activation , pressure gradient develop air exchange alveolar surface occur . Thus , impairment respiratory muscle performance lead pulmonary dysfunction , respiratory distress even death . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) primary disorder central nervous system often affect motor pathway , cause diminish muscle strength endurance throughout body include ventilatory muscle . Respiratory complication recognize major cause morbidity mortality individual advance MS . The investigator ' research team 15 year experience use Functional Magnetic Stimulation ( FMS ) stimulate nerve muscle level injury patient chronic SCI ; also demonstrate significant benefit improve respiratory muscle , bladder bowel function . In study , investigator investigate efficacy use FMS technique respiratory muscle conditioning patient multiple sclerosis ; compare result expire function ( volume , pressure , flow ) generate use FMS technique data obtain use resistive expiratory muscle training ( REMT ) methodology .</detailed_description>
