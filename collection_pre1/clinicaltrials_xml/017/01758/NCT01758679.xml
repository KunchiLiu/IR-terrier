	<brief_title>A Clinical Trail Iodine131I Metuximab Injection With CIK Cells Preventing Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary liver cancer ( hereinafter abbreviate PLC ) one common type malignant tumor clinical practice . Its global prevalence rise year-on-year surpasses 626,000 per year . Ranking No . 5 among malignant tumor , mortality rate approach 600,000 per year becomes No.3 tumor-related death . As one prevalent region PLC world , China morbidity population around 55 % . Among tumor-related death , stand No . 2 second lung cancer . So PLC major hazard health life Chinese citizen . Surgical resection remain first therapeutic choice PLC . However , disease course PLC insidious . In clinical practice , le 30 % PLC patient may treat surgically hepatectomy . And postoperative occurrence recurrence metastasis stay high level . As demonstrated large-sample clinical trial China , 5-year postoperative recurrent rate PLC high 61.5 % . The relevant study indicate surgical therapy PLC encounter bottle-neck last decade control rate postoperative recurrence metastasis remain basically . Therefore recurrence metastasis PLC important limit factor clinical therapeutic gain . Effectively lower post-therapeutic recurrence metastasis PLC become breakthrough point improve clinical efficacy . At present , still standard therapeutic protocol prevention recurrence metastasis PLC . Independently develop recently China , licartin first radioimmunological target therapeutic agent approve PLC world . Since marketing 2007 , achieve excellent clinical efficacy social recognition . As demonstrated result relevant basic clinical research , licartin definite efficacy primary hepatocellular carcinoma could boost efficacy integrate PLC therapy , prolong patient survival enhance benefit clinical therapeutic . Early study also prove could prolong survival PLC , improve quality life prevent postoperative recurrence metastasis . The present clinical trial intend examine efficacy safety radioimmunotherapy via intravenous infusion licartin plus sequential immunotherapy CIK cell control disease progression , effective prolong recurrent time prevention recurrence metastasis primary hepatocellular carcinoma . This clinical trial design provide one kind modality prevent recurrence metastasis PLC . If expect therapeutic efficacy achieve , shall contribute actively boost therapeutic level PLC , prolong recurrent time enhance overall survival . And may also raise clinical recognition technology , promote clinical application generate excellent social reputation economic return .</detailed_description>
