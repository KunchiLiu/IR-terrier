	<brief_summary>The primary aim research examine physical activity healthy population age 40 year old . Subsidiary aim research : 1 . To establish normative value physical activity level , exercise capacity , quality life readiness change physical activity behaviour ( stage change , self-efficacy , decisional balance process change ) healthy population age-matched population bronchiectasis . 2 . To explore physical activity level , exercise capacity quality life healthy population age-matched population bronchiectasis . 3 . To explore readiness change physical activity behaviour ( stage change , self-efficacy , process change decisional balance ) healthy population compare population bronchiectasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study run alongside externally fund project measure physical activity level patient bronchiectasis ( ClinicalTrials.gov ID : NCT01569009 ) . In order fully understand physical activity behaviour bronchiectasis , important compare pattern physical activity , exercise capacity quality life patient bronchiectasis healthy age-matched population . For healthy population similar age patient bronchiectasis , little applicable research currently exist regard normative value physical activity sedentary behaviour . In particular study , measure physical activity level healthy individual age-matched patient bronchiectasis . The commonly used questionnaire assess physical activity International Physical Activity Questionnaire . Pedometers inexpensive device use assess daily step count time spend walk . Activity monitor expensive require technical expertise analysis interpretation . However , provide in-depth information pattern , quantity intensity activity include daily sedentary time . In study , investigator use ActiGraph activity monitor , ActivPAL activity monitor , DigiWalker pedometer IPAQ measure physical activity level healthy individual age-matched patient bronchiectasis . This study focus participant engage high level physical activity unlikely represent physical activity level patient bronchiectasis . This study include Modified Shuttle Test . Exercise capacity measure Modified Shuttle Test normally utilized respiratory disease population patient cystic fibrosis . However , recently highlight need reference data healthy population . This study also use EQ-5D-5L questionnaire ass quality life . Preliminary test EQ-5D-5L questionnaire , update well-researched EQ-5D-3L , recently conduct . There need study provide normative data EQ-5D-5L . This study also assess readiness change physical activity behaviour healthy population utilise transtheoretical model component stage change , self-efficacy , decisional balance process change ; show important physical activity behaviour . Understanding healthy individual ' perspective readiness change physical activity behaviour link important outcome help inform future physical activity intervention .</detailed_description>
