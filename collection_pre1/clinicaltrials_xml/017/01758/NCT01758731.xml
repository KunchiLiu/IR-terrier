	<brief_summary>This research study plan learn safety tolerability investigational drug call Olaparib , combination radiation therapy cetuximab . Hypothesis : Intensity modulate radiotherapy concurrent C225 Olaparib represent feasible , biologically-based alternative standard chemoradiation , acceptable toxicity , treatment locally-advanced HNSCC patient ≥ 10 pack-year smoking history .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Olaparib With Radiation Therapy Cetuximab Advanced Head Neck Cancer With Heavy Smoking History</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outcomes heavy smoker locally-advanced head neck squamous cell cancer ( HNSCC ) treat standard chemoradiation traditionally poor , suggest critical need translation novel biologically-based targeted approach clinical practice . In clinical trial , Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase-1 ( PARP1 ) inhibitor Olaparib combine systemic agent , include paclitaxel , irinotecan , carboplatin gemcitabine , treatment patient various solid tumor . Pre-clinical model show cooperative effect combine PARP inhibition radiation . A combined modality approach utilize RT combination C225 Olaparib induction chemotherapy represent rational , targeted approach investigation locally-advanced HNSCC patient .</detailed_description>
