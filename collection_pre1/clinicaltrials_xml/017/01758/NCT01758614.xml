	<brief_summary>The recently publish Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study ( COSS ) fail show benefit extracranial-intracranial ( EC-IC ) bypass surgery medical therapy patient symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusion . Since , different controversy raise several aspect include study population , qualification surgeon hemodynamic evaluation . In COSS protocol , primary inclusion population patient demonstrate occlusion unilateral ICA contralateral ICA le 50 % stenosis . Because enrollment problem , final result report , 18 % patient suffer contralateral ICA stenosis 50 % . As know , COSS utilize oxygen extraction fraction ( OEF ) ratio PET criterion hemodynamic evaluation . Bilateral ICAs lesion disturb ratio even identify subgroup patient hemodynamic insufficiency . As interventional trial , COSS ensure certification experienced surgeon . While expand number center enhance recruitment , COSS make concession surgeon train certification . The 15 % postoperative event rate best achieve accord recent surgical technical development . The cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency consider primary pathophysiological factor patient ICA MCA occlusion . For patient , antiplatelet therapy likely prevent hemodynamic stroke.EC-IC bypass surgery probably possible effective therapy . These underlying assumption deserve exploration strict research.So CMOSS study China design compare efficacy safety EC-IC bypass surgery medical therapy patient symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Carotid Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Surgery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients symptoms cerebral retinal ischemia associate ipsilateral internal carotid artery ( ICA ) occlusion annual risk 5-8 % recurrent ischemic stroke . While China , incidence middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) occlusion high western country . The annual risk recurrent ischemic stroke patient symptomatic ICA MCA occlusion improve year . The proportion recurrence minor disable rather high .</detailed_description>
