	<detailed_description>Introduction Biliary obstruction relevant life limit factor patient suffer primary secondary bile duct malignancy . Underlying tumor , extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( CCa ) Klatskin type , pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastasis colorectal cancer , often diagnose advanced stage present biliary obstruction . This mostly restrict treatment strategy palliative management . Within set prevention biliary complication like jaundice , cholangitis cholangiosepsis one therapeutic key factor extend survival maintain quality life [ De Groen , Skipworth ] . Endoscopic stenting biliary tract easy safe approach restore biliary drainage [ Smith ] . Self-expanding metal stent prefer plastic stent low risk stent occlusion [ Kaassis , Soderlund ] . In addition stenting endoscopic therapy directly affect local tumor mass , develop within past year . First , photodynamic therapy use different photosensitizers show promising result reduction tumor size maintenance biliary drainage [ Ortner , Zoepf ] . However , patient management treatment involve peri-interventional photosensitivity remain cumbersome . Recently , endoscopically applicable radiofrequency catheter biliary tract , call HabibTM EndoHBP catheter , introduced market . It use bipolar electrical energy tissue coagulation apply without special patient preparation context endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) examination . RFA well known transcutaneous application , already proved effective treatment option hepatocellular carcinoma intrahepatic CCa [ Minami ] . The new HabibTM EndoHBP catheter already evaluate ex vivo [ Itoi ] show promising result concern safety prevention stent occlusion context one small retrospective clinical study [ Steel ] . Primary objective Feasibility safety endoscopic radiofrequency ablation HabibTM EndoHBP catheter treatment malignant biliary obstruction Study Design Retrospective analysis prospectively gain clinical data Primary endpoint Technical failures RFA procedure Secondary endpoints 1 . Complications RFA procedure 2 . Hospital stay 3 . Adverse event hospital stay unil first clinical control discharge ( expect average 4 week RFA procedure ) 4 . 30-day 90-day mortality Study Population All patient underwent endoscopic radiofrequency ablation HabibTM EndoHBP treatment malignant biliary obstruction November 2010 December 2012 Austria . Methods Endoscopic examination report database screen `` radiofrequency ablation '' context `` endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography '' identify mention study population . Examination report , discharge letter patient curve study patient screen yield follow parameter : - Demographics - Sex - Age first RFA-intervention - Underlying disease lead malignant biliary obstruction - Type underlie disease - Time diagnosis first RFA-intervention - Previous treatment attempt ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , photodynamic therapy ) - Procedure related parameter - Prior biliary stent ( type , amount ) - Date RFA procedure - Amount RFA-applications procedure ( energy , time ) - Technical failure RFA catheter RFA procedure ( defined technical problem hinders satisfactory application RFA ) - Complications RFA procedure ( defined adverse change subject 's baseline condition , i.e . unfavorable unintended sign include abnormal laboratory finding , symptom disease consider clinically relevant physician , whether consider related medical device ) - Stenting procedure ( type , amount ) - Post-interventional parameter - Days hospitalization RFA procedure - Adverse event hospital stay first clinical control discharge ( expect average 4 week RFA procedure ) define adverse change subject 's baseline condition , i.e . unfavorable unintended sign include abnormal laboratory finding , symptom disease consider clinically relevant physician , whether consider related medical device - Survial status ( dead/alive ) time data collection - ( Cause death ) - ( Time first RFA procedure death ) Data processing do pseudonymization use continuous patient identification number . All parameter assess descriptively . For scaled parameter ( e.g . age ) median range calculate , nominal parameter ( e.g . type underlie disease ) proportion sub-items report . Mortality assess create Kaplan Meyer curve . 30-day 90-day mortality extrapolate curve . All data process do SPSS 19.0 . Risk/Benefit assessment Due retrospective design study inherit risk study patient . Expected impact Outlook The result study may help good understand feasibility safety profile endoscopic radiofrequency ablation HabibTM EndoHBP catheter potential effect future application .</detailed_description>
