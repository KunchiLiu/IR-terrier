	<brief_summary>Background : - High blood pressure lung , know pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , rare disorder . Some people disease-associated PAH PAH unknown cause . Researchers want follow natural history PAH patient understand PAH progress order discover target future research new treatment . To identify treatment target , compare healthy volunteer patient PAH . Objectives : - To study natural history PAH . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age PAH . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants PAH periodic visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . After first visit , return 6 month yearly every year long study continue . - The first visit take 3 day . It involve follow test : - Physical exam medical history - Blood urine sample - Heart lung function test image study - Six-minute walk test - Questions exercise physical activity - Healthy volunteer one visit Clinical Center , undergo screening test , complete many test patient PAH</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) rare disorder associate poor survival . Endothelial dysfunction result 1 ) genetic susceptibility , 2 ) trigger stimulus initiate pulmonary vascular injury , two-hit hypothesis , appear play central role pathogenesis progression PAH . Inflammation appear drive dysfunctional endothelial phenotype , propagate cycle injury repair genetically susceptible patient idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) patient disease-associated PAH . However , despite mount evidence vascular inflammation patient PAH , detail phenotypic study lack temporal evolution process contribution right ventricular ( RV ) pulmonary vascular remodeling . We hypothesize detailed characterization temporal evolution vascular inflammation PAH impact RV pulmonary vascular function add prognostic value traditional measure disease severity suggest novel therapeutic target future research . Objectives : Patients IPAH disease-associated PAH recruit NIH enrol natural history study investigate ability circulate marker vascular inflammation well high-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) accurately stage severity disease and/or predict clinically relevant outcome . Methods : The total population study 150 PAH subject approximately 55 age gender match control ( i.e . healthy volunteer match less equal 3 PAH subject ) . PAH subject undergo 1 ) standard clinical examination include 6-minute walk distance echocardiography ; 2 ) cardiopulmonary exercise testing ; 3 ) marker coagulation fibrotic disease ; 4 ) plasma profile inflammatory marker ; 5 ) gene expression profile peripheral blood mononuclear cell PBMCs ) ; 6 ) high-resolution MRI-based determination pulmonary vascularand RV structure function 7 ) Cardiac CT scan . Plasma marker endothelial inflammation , PBMC expression profile , high-resolution cardiac MRI also study age gender match control define normal range variability novel assessment . Comparison result PAH subject baseline use determine degree investigative test distinguish PAH patient healthy subject . Likewise , baseline clinical evaluation PAH subject use examine whether novel test ( inflammatory marker , cardiac MRI ) , accurately classify patient accord disease severity . In addition , test investigate prospectively ability predict PAH disease progression . Disease progression define prospectively decrease 6-minute walk distance great equal to10 % baseline clinical worsen require escalation therapy , hospitalization due right heart failure , transplantation death . Additional plasma collect PAH subject age/gender match control subject . This material use probe new biomarkers inflammatory factor use discovery base approach ( i.e . Proteomics pulmonary artery endothelial cell bioassay ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PAH SUBJECTS Inclusion Criteria PAH Subjects : The follow parameter RHC require meet hemodynamic definition PAH ( NYHA/WHO Group I PH ) : mean pulmonary artery pressure great 25 mmHg rest , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less equal 15 mmHg ( left ventricular enddiastolic pressure less equal 12mmHg ) pulmonary vascular resistance great 3 Wood unit ( 240 dyn cm ( 5 ) ) . For patient suspect PAH ( Group I PH ) undergone RHC and/or additional test confirm diagnosis , test complete clinically indicated procedural consent . If clinically indicate ( diagnostic ) test indicates subject suspect PAH fact meet standard criterion PAH ( Group I PH ) , subject remove study .
