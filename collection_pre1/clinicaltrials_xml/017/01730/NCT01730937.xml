	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study sorafenib tosylate stereotactic body radiation therapy see well work compare sorafenib tosylate alone treat patient liver cancer . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send radiation dose directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Giving sorafenib tosylate together stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate With Without Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) improve overall survival hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patient treat sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine difference time progression ( TTP ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) HCC patient treat sorafenib compare SBRT follow sorafenib . II . To measure difference toxicity HCC patient treat sorafenib versus SBRT follow sorafenib . III . To measure vascular thrombosis response post sorafenib versus SBRT follow sorafenib . IV . To measure difference health relate quality life ( QOL ) quality-adjusted survival HCC patient treat sorafenib compare SBRT follow sorafenib . V. Collection biospecimens future correlative study investigate difference potential biomarkers patient treat sorafenib versus SBRT follow sorafenib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM 1 : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM 2 : Patients undergo SBRT every 24-72 hour total 5 fraction 5 15 day . Within 1-5 day post-SBRT , patient receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow weekly SBRT , monthly sorafenib tosylate follow schedule whole study entry : every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year annually .</detailed_description>
