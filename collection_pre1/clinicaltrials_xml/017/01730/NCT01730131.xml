	<brief_summary>Background : - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) severe viral infection brain . It cause JC virus . Many people virus body life , usually keep check immune system . If immune system work right disease medication , virus becomes active damage cell brain . Not much know PML affect immune system . Researchers want study people PML good understand natural history disease . Objectives : - To study natural history PML . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age PML . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , image study . - Participants several visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . There initial visit , monthly visit next 6 month , 12-month visit , possible visit afterward . - At initial visit , participant give blood , urine , spinal fluid sample . They also neurological test image study brain . - For next five visit , participant give blood urine sample . They also neurological test image study brain . - The 6-month 12-month visit repeat test initial visit . - Other optional procedure include bone marrow sample skin biopsy . Additional blood test image study may perform . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study examine natural course progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) . PML devastating , demyelinate neurological disease affect brain patient compromise immune system . It cause reactivation JC virus ( JCV ) , small DNA virus infects majority population without clinical significance . There currently treatment available PML . We plan study patient suspect confirmed PML different underlying condition include patient immune-modulatory therapy multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , rheumatologic disease autoimmune disease , well patient HIV infection condition lead compromise immune system . Patients see defined time point disease course detailed assessment perform collect clinical imaging data . Blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) also collect time point evaluate behavior biology JCV patient immune response infection . These test lead good understanding pathophysiology PML course disease different patient group . Specifically , detailed characterization use help identify : 1 . Clinical and/or image feature pathognomonic PML may aid early diagnosis intervention 2 . Clinical image and/or laboratory feature disease course predictive clinical outcome This information integrate develop clinically relevant , disease-specific assessment scale PML , currently available . Such scale would useful tool clinical management patient ( i.e. , development standard care ) , well clinical trial design interpretation . The long-term objective study improve understanding disease course underlie pathophysiology , identify subgroup different prognosis and/or susceptibility intervention , help identify therapeutic target and/or intervention strategy . Equally important , effort allow development repository cryopreserved biological sample use validation candidate biomarkers future study ; data biological bank make available outside laboratory .</detailed_description>
