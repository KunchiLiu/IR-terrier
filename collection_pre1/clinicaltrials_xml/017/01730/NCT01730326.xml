	<detailed_description>Materials Methods Research : Among patient consult emergency service complaint headache , meet criterion 'International Classification Headache Disorders criterion migraine without aura ' agree participate study form study group . The patient form study group include study evaluate accord criterion inclusion exclusion . Our research equivalence study . Provided difference group 50 % , α : 99 % , 1-β : 80 % , determine group include least 94 subject , number voluntary subject determine 200 , group contain 100 subject . First , measurement frequency headache , standard 11-point Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) , whose reliability proven , 100-mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) use . For NRS , patient ask score pain scale range 0 10 , score 0 ( zero ) absence pain , 10 case severe pain ; whereas , VAS , ask score pain scale range 0 100 , score 0 absence pain , 100 case severe pain . Verbal rating scale ( VRS ) 4 standard point use another measurement tool . In measurement , patient ask express pain severe , moderate , mild pain . The patient divide two group . Groups drug dos give ; 1. group : Dexketoprofen Trometamol ( 50 mg ) 2. group : Paracetamol ( 1000 mg ) The drug give randomization dilute 150 ml serum physiologic give intravenous rapid infusion . The pain patient assess 0. , 15. 30. minute NRS , VAS VRS , monitor vital sign possible side effect . In 30. minute , study end , If pain continue , fentanyl 1 mcg / kg give . When patient eligible study consults , obtain patient 's write consent , patient assign one study group base next study number . Randomization study number prepare someone person work emergency service help computer , completion study , number assign drug know person . One nurse work emergency department responsible prepare study drug , nurse blindly responsible give study drug . The number belong previously enumerate study group store envelope show inside ( allocation concealment ) , study drug prepare next envelope open study nurse . Patients eligible study take unit call 'observation monitor ' emergency department , monitor IV vascular access establish . The study drug prepare emergency nurse responsible study give nurse . Medicines prepare group transparent .</detailed_description>
