	<brief_summary>Cortical Visual Field Defects ( CFVD ) common acquire brain injury . They often cause problem read visual exploration impact patient ' quality life . Apart substitutive method use prism directly place glass , two main rehabilitative method explore previously : one restorative one compensatory . The effective method seem base compensatory training paradigm target eye movement . They rely voluntary mass-practice induces change exploratory saccadic behaviour , particularly blind hemifield . Previous study use method show change visual scanning pattern marginal profit term functional benefit . In present study , investigator develop new approach compensatory visual field training base solely bottom-up mechanism . It require patient ' ability voluntarily maintain attention orient affected field , may difficult brain-damaged patient . As previously report pathological context ( e.g . use prism adaptation sensory stimulation neglect patient ) , bypass voluntary conscious implication patient produce improvement automatic process . The investigator hypothesis : 1 ) novel ramp-step search paradigm use hemianopic patient automatically improve target eye movement blind visual field ; 2 ) lead behavioural improvement ecologically valid test visual search .</brief_summary>
