	<brief_summary>Iron metabolism may undergo change exercise , reduction classical iron status marker due variety postulate mechanism include hemodilution , increase iron loss , hemolysis increase iron storage muscle . Furthermore , report vigorous training increase hepcidin , central regulatory peptide iron metabolism . This increase ascribe presence subclinical inflammation . Increased hepcidin level may reduce iron bioavailability iron incorporation erythrocyte . Twenty healthy men subject recruit subject study . Subjects generally healthy , history blood donation last 6 month , weigh less 85 Kg , take iron supplement and/or multivitamin supplement . Subjects familiarity sport run , currently ( i.e . past 3 month ) train 1h per week average . The aim study measure iron bioavailability rest exercise phase last approx . 14 day train session alternate day . Subjects participate restign exercising protocol act control study . Iron bioavailability measure via incorporation stable isotopic label 14 day administration . To control change blood volume course study , blood volume participate subject measure exercise phase CO-rebreathing method . Measurement iron bioavailability iron incorporation rest exercise phase allow determine increase level hepcidin see exercise induce low iron bioavailability iron incorporation exercise .</brief_summary>
