	<brief_summary>Deep carious lesion encounter dentist challenge select treatment method could avoid pulpal exposure maintain pulp vitality.Conventional restorative treatment suggest complete removal caries one visit could cause pulpal exposure 53 % case next step need pulpotomy , pulpectomy Root Canal Therapy ( RCT ) . Stepwise Excavation ( SE ) old concept research recently reduce possibility pulpal exposure removal lesion . Contrary Indirect Pulp Capping ( IPC ) , technique central infected part caries remove first visit rest caries line suitable material suppress remain cariogenic biomass seal cavity . This help pulp defend survive . After period , cavity re-opened rest caries darker , hard less bacteria remove tooth restore permanently.The aim study compare effect different lining material clinical radiographical symptom stepwise excavation without re-enter one year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Of Different Lining Materials Stepwise Excavation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In randomized clinical trial 4 lining material apply deep caries teeth stepwise excavation . The common material applied liner remain caries SE Calcium Hydroxide ( CH ) . There several report solubility liner time could interact seal cavity long term . It seem material antibacterial activity , good sealing ability suitable mechanical property could cause SE do efficiently good prognosis . MTA biomaterial introduce since 1993 antibacterial property good sealing ability . A New Endodontic Cement , Calcium Enriched Mixture ( CEM ) cement good antibacterial effect like CH seal ability propose similar MTA accord double seal property . CEM cement suggest suitable material pulp cap permanent molar irreversible pulpitis .</detailed_description>
