	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well bevacizumab without radiation therapy work treat patient recurrent glioblastoma . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know whether bevacizumab effective without radiation therapy treat patient recurrent glioblastoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish improvement overall survival recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) patient receive bevacizumab re-irradiation compare patient receive bevacizumab alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate compare rate objective response patient measurable disease . II . To estimate compare 6-month progression-free survival rate . III . To estimate compare progression-free survival . IV . To estimate compare rate treatment adverse event . V. To estimate compare rate grade 3+ acute delayed central nervous system ( CNS ) toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute every 2 week . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab patient arm I undergo radiation therapy use intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3D-CRT ) , proton beam radiation therapy ( RT ) 5 day week 2 week . In arm , course repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histopathologically proven diagnosis glioblastoma variant ( gliosarcoma , giant cell glioblastoma etc ) ; patient eligible original histology lowergrade glioma subsequent diagnosis glioblastoma gliosarcoma make Patients recent surgery glioblastoma must show unequivocal radiographic evidence tumor progression contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ( compute tomography [ CT ] scan patient noncompatible device ) CT scan within 21 day prior registration . * Note : Patients surgery postoperative contrastenhance scan fall outside 5 week window prior registration , must repeat MRI scan ( CT scan patient noncompatible device ) within 21 day prior registration . Patients also must pass interval 6 month great completion prior radiotherapy registration ; patient pass interval least 6 month , may still eligible meet one follow criterion : New area tumor outside original radiotherapy field determine investigator , Histologic confirmation tumor biopsy resection , Nuclear medicine imaging , magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy , MR perfusion image consistent true progressive disease , rather radiation necrosis obtain within 28 day registration AND interval least 90 day completion radiotherapy registration Patients unable undergo MR image noncompatible device enrol provided CT scan obtain sufficient quality ; patient without noncompatible device may use CT scan perform meet requirement Prior history standard dose CNS radiation 60 Gy 30 fraction 59.4 Gy 1.8 Gy fraction , equivalent low dose Patients receive prior treatment nonstandard radiation therapy ( RT ) dose fractionation , interstitial brachytherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery , etc . eligible Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy , must minimum time 28 day prior registration administration investigational agent prior cytotoxic therapy follow exception : 14 day administration vincristine 42 day administration nitrosoureas 21 day administration procarbazine Patients undergone recent resection glioblastoma ( within 5 week prior registration ) must recover effect surgery ; CNS relate core needle biopsy , minimum 7 day must elapse prior registration Residual disease follow resection recurrent glioblastoma mandate eligibility study ; best ass extent residual disease postoperatively , postoperative intraoperative MRI scan ( CT scan patient noncompatible device ) must perform prior registration within 96 hour post surgery ( although 24 hour would optimum ) History/physical examination , include neurologic examination , within 14 day prior registration Karnofsky performance status &gt;

UPC ratio 1 roughly equivalent 24hour urine protein 1 gm ; UPC ratio calculate use one follow formula : [ urine protein ] / [ urine creatinine ] : protein creatinine report mg/dL [ ( urine protein ) x 0.088 ] / [ urine creatinine ] : urine creatinine report mmol/L Patients must pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) breast feeding ; pregnancy test must do within 14 day prior registration ; effective contraception ( men woman ) must use patient childbearing potential trial 6 month Patients fulldose anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin low molecular weigh [ LMW ] heparin ) must meet following criterion : No active bleeding pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g. , tumor involve major vessel know varix ) Inrange international normalize ratio ( INR ) ( usually 2 3 ) stable dose oral anticoagulant stable dose low molecular weight heparin , within 14 day prior registration Patient must able provide studyspecific inform consent prior study entry More three relapse Infratentorial leptomeningeal evidence recurrent disease Recurrent persistent tumor great 6 cm maximum diameter Prior therapy inhibitor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGFR ( include bevacizumab ) Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 1 year ( example , carcinoma situ breast , oral cavity , cervix permissible ) Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month prior registration Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month prior registration History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month prior registration Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , history aortic dissection ) clinically significant peripheral vascular disease Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ;
