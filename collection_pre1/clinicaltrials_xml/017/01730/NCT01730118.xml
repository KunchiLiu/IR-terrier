	<brief_summary>Background : - HER2/neu ( HER2 ) tumor protein appear almost third breast cancer several type cancer colon , prostate non-small cell lung . Tumors overexpress HER2 associate aggressive cancer , high recurrence rate , reduce survival rate . Researchers test therapeutic cancer vaccine design stimulate immune system recognize HER2 . The vaccine , call AdHER2/neu dendritic cell vaccine , custom-made use individual immune cell . These cell collect used produce vaccine . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness AdHER2 vaccination . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age HER2-expressing tumor . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study also perform . - Participants apheresis procedure collect immune cell create vaccine . - Participants receive four dos vaccine study Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 24 . - Participants monitor physical exam , frequent blood test image study ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 , also know c-erbB2 neu ) proto-oncogene encodes 185-kd transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor participate receptor-receptor interaction regulate cell growth , differentiation proliferation . Its over-expression contributes neoplastic transformation . - HER2 over-expressed 25-30 % node-positive node-negative primary breast cancer associate clinically aggressive breast cancer , high recurrence rate reduce survival . - Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ( Registered trademark ) ) recombinant humanize mouse monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) bind extracellular ( EC ) domain HER2 receptor . Its clinical efficacy limit patient 3+ HER2 tumor expression document immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) Vysis fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) ratio great 2.2 . IHC subjective measurement HER2/neu protein FISH objective measurement amplification HER2 oncogene . - Although use trastuzumab associate improved clinical outcome , significant number patient unresponsive therapy eventually experience clinical progression . At present vaccine available induces patient make anti-HER2 antibody . - We propose investigate use adenoviral vector ( Ad5f35 ) express human HER2ECTM ( Ad5f35HER2ECTM- AdHER2 ) transduce autologous dendritic cell therapeutic vaccination patient HER2 express solid tumor . Objectives : - To determine safety toxicity autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination . -- Specifically , determine fraction patient cardiac toxicity , define decrease LVEF great equal 10 % baseline decrease absolute LVEF le equal 50 % , sufficiently low warrant development subsequent trial . - To determine immunogenicity autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination measure 3-fold increase anti-HER2/neu antibody concentration 4-fold increase antibody dilution titer baseline . Study Design : Open label , non-randomized , two part , phase I/ pilot study 52 week duration evaluation primary endpoint extend follow-up 30 month monitor LVEF cardiac function . Part I involve vaccine dose escalation population prior exposure trastuzumab HER2-targeted therapy determine significant , adverse safety signal regard cardiac toxicity , addition preliminary assessment vaccine immunogenicity clinical activity . Five dos 5 , 10 , 20 40 x 10 ( 6 ) viable cells/AdHER2 DC vaccine give intradermally Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 16 24 patient metastatic solid tumor high risk bladder cancer adjuvant set characterize HER2/neu expression . Re-staging clinical evidence stable disease , partial response well immune-related response criterion assess Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 , 36 48 confirmatory scan ( indicate ) Weeks 12 , 20 , 28 , 40 52 . Adjuvant bladder cancer patient undergo re-staging evidence disease recurrence ( confirmatory scan 4 week later recurrence document ) Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 , 36 48 . Part II identical part I , conduct population significant prior exposure trastuzumab HER2-targeted therapy . Eligibility : Part I : - Adults great equal 18 recurrent , metastatic solid tumor characterize HER2/neu expression trastuzumab clinically indicate : - Patients ovarian , colon , non-small cell lung , renal cell , bladder prostate cancer HER2 1+ , 2+ 3+ IHC OR Vysis FISH result &gt; 1.8 . - Patients breast cancer HER2 1+ 2+ IHC Vysis FISH result 1.8 - &lt; 2.2 . - Measurable disease , exception metastatic bladder cancer patient complete first line chemotherapy may measurable disease . - Adults great equal 18 HER2+ bladder cancer adjuvant set - Tumor stage T3a , T3b , T4a T4b node positive disease . - Tumors HER2 1+ , 2+ 3+ IHC Vysis FISH result &gt; 1.8 . - great equal 6 week status post primary surgery curative intent . - ECOG 0-1 . - Naive trastuzumab , pertuzumab , lapatnib , ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( TDM1 ) investigational HER2-directed therapy . Part II : - Adults great equal 18 breast cancer 3+ HER2/neu expression IHC Vysis FISH result &gt; 2.2 . - Recurrent metastatic disease , ECOG 0-1 . - Disease progression follow 1 2 course therapy know clinical benefit i.e . trastuzumab , pertuzumab , lapatinib , TDM1 investigational HER2 agent NONE last 1 week prior enrollment . - Documented response HER2-directed therapy metastatic disease . - Measurable disease .</detailed_description>
