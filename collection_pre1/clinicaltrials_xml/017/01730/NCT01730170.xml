	<detailed_description>There compel need prospective , properly control study woman epilepsy ( WWE ) pregnancy improve maternal child outcome . The proposed investigation pertinent National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke Epilepsy Research Benchmarks address multiple gap knowledge note recent American Academy Neurology guideline . This multicenter investigation employ prospective , observational , parallel-group , cohort design establish research team . The specific aim : 1 . Determine woman epilepsy increased seizure pregnancy delineate contribute factor ; 2 . Determine C-section rate increase woman epilepsy delineate contributing factor ; 3 . Determine woman epilepsy increase risk depression pregnancy post-partum period characterize risk factor ; 4 . Determine long-term effect utero antiepileptic drug exposure verbal intellectual ability neurobehavioral outcome child woman epilepsy ; 5 . Determine small gestation age adverse neonatal outcome increase child woman epilepsy ; 6 . Determine breastfeed take antiepileptic drug impair child 's verbal intellectual cognitive ability . An overall goal propose research establish relationship antiepileptic drug exposure outcomes mother child well describe explain variability antiepileptic drug exposure response . Anticonvulsant blood level ( ABLs ) area-under-the-concentration-time-curves ( AUCs ) use direct measure drug exposure . The result enable clinician prospectively calculate individual dosing regimens mother order optimize dose limit unnecessary drug exposure child . In addition , genetic sample collect , provide valuable resource future pharmacogenetics study delineate individual variability across patient .</detailed_description>
