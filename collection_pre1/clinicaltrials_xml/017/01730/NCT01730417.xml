	<detailed_description>The goal proposal produce test high specific activity Ultratrace iobenguane I 123 normal human volunteer . The low specific activity iobenguane I 123 show useful detection stag neuroendocrine tumor adult child image neuronal activity heart . The innovation proposal use patented solid phase technology produce prove diagnostic agent extremely high specific activity increase sensitivity specificity low radiation exposure normal organ without pharmacologically active cold carrier compound . The FDA considers iobenguane label two different isotope iodine [ I-131 I-123 ] two distinct drug require distinct regulatory application . To meet required quality standard chemistry , manufacturing control component IND application , GMP quality polymer drug precursor use generate Ultratrace diagnostic iodine-123 agent . Analytical method validate proposed final drug formulation demonstrate final drug interfere test use define identity , purity , strength agent . The drug product verify apyrogenicity sterility human testing . The IND application write submit FDA Duke Medical Center IRB . MIP produce clinical trial material , conduct human test radioactive drug substance safety superiority compare conventional iobenguane I 123 normal healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
