	<brief_title>To Study Safety Efficacy Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) traumatic disorder result functional deficit usually lead severe permanent paralysis project data relate burden spinal cord injury across globe quite alarm . Pharmacological rehabilitation therapy SCI get limited effect . There definitely urgent need find different method treatment patient undergo establish modality treatment try unsuccessfully . Another promising therapeutic approach SCI `` Stem cell transplantation '' . Bone marrow derive stem cell show promote anatomical functional recovery animal model SCI promote tissue sparing , axonal regeneration , remyelination . In present study , want evaluate safety efficacy autologous bone marrow derive stem cell surgically transplant intrathecally patient spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
