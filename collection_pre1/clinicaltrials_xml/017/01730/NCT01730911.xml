	<detailed_description>1 . STUDY PURPOSE AND RATIONALE Intrauterine device ( IUDs ) effective yet underutilized form contraception United States . Only 5.5 % woman age 15-44 report use 2006-2008 ( Mosher 2010 ) . Due historical practice prescribe recommendation , IUD insertion may delay woman must wait result screen sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) begin menstrual cycle . Such barrier prevalent contraceptive method . Initiation oral contraceptive pill ( OCPs ) , vaginal ring , transdermal patch , depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection , emergency contraception ( EC ) indicate , safely do day woman 's visit provider . This `` Quick Start '' approach improve access birth control well study Family Planning Clinic Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center institution ( Westhoff 2002 , Schafer 2006 , Murthy 2005 , Rickert 2007 ) . The investigator provider often extend practice IUD insertion , outcomes formally assess . If investigator show insertion time safe , investigator improve access . There several concern surround IUD insertion time initial visit health care provider . One problem insertion outside first week menstrual cycle may `` window '' pregnancy occur first cycle IUD place . For OCPs initiate Quick Start protocol , pregnancy rate approximately 2 % ( Westhoff 2007 ) . No data exist IUDs insertion part cycle differ regard number window pregnancy . Another theoretical drawback immediate IUD initiation insertion set undiagnosed STI . While risk develop pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) high 20 day postinsertion , incidence pelvic inflammatory disease among IUD user rare estimate 1:100 1:1,000 woman-years ( Martinez 2009 ) . Evidence support routine screen sexually transmit infection prior IUD insertion woman low risk STIs , test do base local prevalence data ( Walsh 1998Í¾ Skjeldestad 1996 ) . For woman young 26 multiple sex partner , screen do day insertion . However , variation individual provider practice pattern additional barrier delay IUD insertion put woman risk interval pregnancy await IUD insertion . Alterations cramp , expulsion , bleed pattern may may associate cycle day insertion nonetheless could contribute satisfaction continuation rate IUD . In 60 month study TCu380A IUDs Iran , approximately 25 % woman discontinue method due bleed pain ( Jenabi 2006 ) . Another study do Kuwait find irregular heavy bleeding common complaint ( Alnakash 2008 ) . Published data issue sparse . Without evidence alternative safe two IUDs currently available , physician may reluctant individualize . An accurate assessment bleed pattern IUD insertion rest quality data gather . In 2005 , Mishell issue guideline standardization data collection analysis bleed pattern combine hormone contraceptive trial , note need prospective comparative study accuracy electronic data collection versus paper diary ( Mishell , 2005 ) . There publish data compare quality quantity information obtain use two method , text message increasingly use collect data clinical trial . This study afford u opportunity compare new modality exist method .</detailed_description>
