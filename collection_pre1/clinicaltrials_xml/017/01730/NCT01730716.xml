	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Safety Study Human Spinal Cord Derived Neural Stem Cell Transplantation Treatment Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>These stem cell call Human Spinal Stem Cells ( HSSC ) engineer spinal cord single fetus electively abort 8 week gestation . The tissue obtain mother 's consent . The cell transplant ALS patient 's spinal cord laminectomy , operation remove bone surround spine . After spinal cord expose , device manufacture purpose mount onto patient hold syringe fill cell . The syringe needle attach needle enter spinal cord 5-10 location inject cell . The device minimize trauma spinal cord needle make puncture precise steady inject material slow steady speed . ALS universally fatal neurodegenerative condition cause weakness lead paralysis death . Life expectancy 2-5 year . The cause unknown effective treatment . Previous research show autopsy , ALS patient find increased level amino acid glutamate accumulate brain spinal cord . This increase think caused decrease glutamate transporter normally `` clean '' glutamate cell . HSSC known express amino acid transporter hop action reduce toxicity accumulate glutamate benefit ALS patient . There second hypothesize benefit HSSC ability secrete neurotrophic support factor . Neurotrophic factor support health nerve . There 5 sequential cohort ( Groups A - E ) 3 subject cohort . New patient enrol group . No control group include . All subject receive spinal cord injection HSSC . All subject also ambulatory respiratory function great equal 50 % supine 60 % seat predict normal receive bilateral injection C3 C5 cervical segment . Subjects Group E receive bilateral injection L2 L5 lumbar segment return approximately one-three month later receive bilateral injection C3 C5 cervical segment . The dose escalation plan follow : 1 . Group A : 3 ambulatory early-stage subject arm weakness paralysis , receive bilateral C3 C4 injection 2x106 cell ( 10 injection x 2x105 cells/ injection ) 2 . Group B : 3 ambulatory early-stage subject arm weakness paralysis , receive bilateral C3 C5 injection 4x106 cell ( 20 injection x 2x105 cells/ injection ) 3 . Group C : 3 ambulatory early-stage subject arm weakness paralysis , receive bilateral C3 C5 injection 6x106 cell ( 20 injection x 3x105 cells/ injection ) 4 . Group D : 3 ambulatory early-stage subject arm weakness paralysis , receive bilateral C3 C5 injection 8x106 cell ( 20 injection x 4x105 cells/ injection ) 5 . Group E : 3 ambulatory early-stage subject arm weakness paralysis , receive bilateral L2 L5 injection 8x106 cell ( 20 injection 4x105 cells/ injection ) approximately 4-12 week later receive bilateral C3 C5 injection 8x106 cell ( 20 injection 4x105 cells/ injection . Transition one group next determine review available safety data Safety Monitoring Board ( SMB ) occur approximately one month post surgery last subject group . The study data collect 6 month post stem cell transplantation study subject . However , subject follow clinically death SAEs post-study data collect report . Autopsy strongly encourage evaluation pathology presence transplant cell . The treatment consist laminectomy laminoplasty approximately two three vertebral segment overlie either L2 L4 ( Group E ) C3 C5 cord segment ( Groups ) order allow intraspinal injection HSSC . Each injection administer approximately 2 , 3 , 4 x 105 cell approximately 8.5 - 10 µL volume . The subject receive 5 10 injection approximately 4 5mm interval side cord , total 10 20 injection . Each injection complete approximately 3 minute . The total surgical time expect approximately 3 5 hour . After surgery , subject receive routine standard care laminectomy subject undergo intradural procedure . Prior transplant , subject require remain immunosuppressive therapy . Immunosuppressive therapy consist : 1 ) basiliximab ( Simulect® ) 20mg intravenously ( IV ) dura open , day 4 post transplantation ; 2 ) tacrolimus ( Prograf® ) initially dose maximum 0.1 mg/kg divide approximately every 12 hour mouth ( po ) post transplant day 1 , maintain dose provide trough serum level 4 8 ng/ml ( adjust IV use necessary ) ; 3 ) mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept® ) start post transplant day 1 500 mg approximately every 12 hour progressively increase 2 week 1.0 gram mouth ( po ) twice day tolerate . Dose escalation may modify discretion site Principal Investigator ( PI ) . Subjects also receive initial bolus dose methylprednisolone 125 mg IV approximately 2 hour prior first injection . Beginning post-operative day 1 , subject receive oral prednisone 60 mg po daily ( QD ) 7 day postoperatively , progressively decrease next 21 day follow : 40 mg/day 7 day , 20 mg/day 7 day , 10 mg/day 7 day . At 28 day , prednisone discontinue . All pre- post-surgery immunosuppressive drug administer note , discretion site PI . If subject previously discontinue mycophenolate mofetil and/or tacrolimus , may re-challenged per dose describe , discretion site PI . The decision continue immunosuppression therapy discretion site PIs . Mycophenolate mofetil may dose half discontinue prior end study period subject experience adverse reaction immunosuppressive agent . If adverse reaction still persist , tacrolimus dose reduce half consider discontinue . Any immunosuppressive agent may reduce stopped discretion site PI suspect determined immunosuppressive agent cause toxicity symptom toxicity manage adequately symptomatic treatment . The study proceed successively Group A Group E 4-week interval Groups . The Safety Monitoring Board ( SMB ) convene end 4-week interval review available safety data . Based safety outcomes 3 subject Group , SMB recommend , accord predetermine rule , whether enroll 3 new subject next Group , continue collect additional information Group , enroll additional subject Group , suspend study . Potential subject recruit study put wait list SMB approval treatment . The SMB consist 3 neurologist expertise ALS , 1 spinal neurosurgeon , 1 neurooncologist , 1 transplant immunologist , scientific director ALS Association . Subjects assessed adverse event include pain infection , motor function , quality life . Additional assessment make measure postoperative change baseline neurologic deficit , image study , bladder bowel function , allodynia , neuropathic pain ( see schedule activity ) . Subjects also undergo serial assessment respiratory function ( vital capacity ( VC ) negative inspiratory force ( NIF ) ) , motor function ( Ashworth Spasticity Scale , hand-held dynamometry electrical impedance myography ( EIM ) ) , respiratory function ( diaphragm ultrasound ) . All subject undergo cardiac autonomic function test Day -14 Day -2 pre-operatively , 1 3 month post-operatively monitor potential cardiac autonomic neuropathy . There lead-in period least 1 month period clinical evaluation surgery estimate slope decline clinical status . Measures lead-in time ALSFRS-R , hand-held dynamometry/grip strength , Ashworth Spasticity Scale , VC NIF , EIM , diaphragm ultrasound.Subjects follow postoperatively 2 4 week , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 month , every 6 month thereafter death .</detailed_description>
