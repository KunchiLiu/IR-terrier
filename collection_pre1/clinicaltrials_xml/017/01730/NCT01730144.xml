	<brief_summary>Background : - One form influenza vaccine nasal spray . It use live weaken flu virus . Researchers want well live vaccine interacts body immune system . They test nasal spray flu vaccine ( call FluMist ) saline ( salt water ) nasal spray . They look blood nasal cell sample see vaccine affect cell immune response . Objectives : - To look immune change nasal blood cell people receive live flu vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 49 year age . Design : - Participants five outpatient visit study . Each visit last 2 hour . - At first visit , participant physical exam medical history . They give blood urine sample . Nasal cell sample also collect . - A week later , participant either nasal spray flu vaccine saline spray . They know spray receive . Blood sample collect . - Two day vaccination , another physical exam . Blood nasal cell sample collect . - At final two visit ( 1 week 1 month vaccination ) , blood sample collect . - Those saline spray able actual vaccine spray last study visit . - The ratio participant receive vaccine receive saline 4:1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two type influenza vaccine currently license US , trivalent inactivate vaccine ( TIV ) , administer intramuscular injection , LAIV , administer nasal spray . Both vaccine safe effective approve age group . Neutralizing antibody serum find correlate protection TIV , immune correlate protection LAIV know . Defining origin nature transcriptional response LAIV URT infect bystander epithelial lymphocyte cell healthy adult highly informative first step system approach toward understand molecular basis viral replication restriction regulation local mucosal immune response follow LAIV administration . This natural history study use system biology approach identify LAIV replication niche among variety URT cell type characterize host immune response LAIV . Healthy volunteer age 18-49 year prescreened low ( &lt; 1:10 ) serum HAI titer component influenza vaccine virus strain ( influenza A H1N1 H3N2 , influenza B ) license seasonal LAIV . Ten HAIlow -negative individual vaccinate intranasally LAIV ( n=8 ) receive saline intranasally ( n=2 ) . One week prior 2 day vaccine administration , NP specimen collect use flock NP swab . A blood sample collect time NP swabbing Days 7 28 vaccination . Total subject participation time enrollment/baseline final study visit 5 week . We propose recover cell NP swab sample sort individual cell different subset base specific surface phenotypic marker . We utilize microfluidics-based real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rRT-PCR ) quantify transcript bulk single cell . These transcript include strand-specific influenza RNA determine virus replication , gene assign cell specific epithelial lymphocyte subpopulation , select gene IFN signal pathway determine innate immune response , gene involve activation effector function different immune cell subset . Results analyze several bioinformatics tool , emphasis differential signal response various cell type . The mucosal transcriptional data correlate B T cell immunity marker traditional serology ( HAI neutralization assay ) vaccination identify key factor affect immune response LAIV .</detailed_description>
