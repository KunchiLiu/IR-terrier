	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) cabergoline woman metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . II . Evaluate toxicity . III . Correlate serum prolactin level therapy response . IV . Evaluate within-patient change compute tomography ( CT ) bone scan measurement take baseline 2 cycle treatment . V. Evaluate within-patient change prolactin receptor ( PRLr ) expression baseline 1 cycle treatment patient consent optional repeat biopsy . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabergoline orally ( PO ) twice weekly week 1-4 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
