	<brief_title>The Effect Ankle Taping Balance Exercises Postural Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability control body space complex interaction musculoskeletal neural system . This set call postural control system . Postural control involve control body position space dual purpose postural stability postural orientation . Balance process divide four-stage Sullivan Markos : mobility , stability , control mobility , skill . Several type exercise propose improve proprioception . Bout Gahery state balance exercise improve neuromuscular relation reduces proprioception error . They believe proprioception difficulty may benefit exercise therapy.Taping another technique enhance proprioception . Improvement proprioception lead good function reduction disability . Kinesiotaping used prevent injury help cure injury . It also improve efficiency sport , improve lymph venous circulation , decrease edema , stimulate mechanoreceptors increase awareness subject ankle position , reduce pain improves muscle performance</detailed_description>
