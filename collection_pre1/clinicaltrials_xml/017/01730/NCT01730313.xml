	<detailed_description>Nodding Syndrome ( NS ) describe epileptic seizure disorder document various geographic area sub-Saharan Africa . Jilek et al , 1962 , first describe several child attack 'nodding head ' Mahenge , region southern Tanzania ( 1,2,3 ) . A missionary doctor describe child southern Sudan mid-1990s , first note Lui Amadi village East Mundri county Lui region western Equatoria ; medical NGO report condition WHO 1997 . An estimated 300 case report 2003 region ( 4 , 5 ) . Winkler et al. , use data Tanzania provide clinical classification seizure , semiology socio-cultural aspect suggest syndrome ( refer `` head-nodding syndrome '' ) form epilepsy ( 6 , 7 ) . In 2008 2009 , report illness consistent NS report Kitgum Pader district , northern Uganda . Kaiser et al , 2009 , refer phenomenon head nod possibly constitute feature epileptic syndrome cause O. volvulus ( 8 ) . Descriptions feature NS appear similar report ( Appendix A ) . Nodding frequently describe occur response stimulus , frequently presence food exposure cold ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) . The nodding consist repetitive bob nodding head , sometimes associate loss muscle tone trunk upper extremity ( 6 , 7 ) . Consciousness may may impair nod episode . The syndrome described progressive , gradual neurological deterioration development additional seizure type , developmental regression , cognitive decline , sometimes reportedly result serious injury death due accidental fall fire well seizure episode . Treatment conventional antiepileptic medication anecdotally report result symptomatic improvement nod seizure type . Health worker southern Sudan report child start treatment early regular basis seizure less frequently ( 9 ) . The cause NS unknown . Various factor exposure postulate cause NS , include exposure munition , prior history measles infection , consumption baboon meat sorghum , others . Two recent case-control investigation , one conduct among child NS Uganda 2009 - 2010 another conduct S. Sudan 2011 ( ) support association . One risk factor appear consistently demonstrate association NS evidence infection , past present , microfilarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus , similar microfilarial parasite serologically cross-reactive Onchocerca . O. volvulus transmit black fly . Clinical manifestation onchocerciasis mainly ocular , resultant vision loss due inflammatory keratitis ( `` River Blindness '' ) . A significant association NS detection O. volvulus microfilariae skin snip observe case-control investigation Sudan 2001 - 2002 , assessment Tanzania ( 84 % 62 child NS microfilariae O. volvulus nucleic acid skin snip ) . Various study review identify association onchocerciasis epilepsy general ( 5 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 44 , 46 ) . A high prevalence seizure disorder onchocerciasis endemic area note Western Equatoria 1946 . In WHO investigation conduct southern Sudan late 2001 , skin snip positivity high microfilaria load O. volvulus find child NS compare child without condition , consistent similar observation possible association seizure onchocerciasis study ( 5 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 44 , 46 ) . These , subsequent investigation 2002 WHO could identify environmental pollutant , chemical agent food toxin , several infectious agent , possible cause seizure . EEG among 31 child assess show progressive epileptic encephalopathy . In December 2009 , team US Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) assist Uganda Ministry Health WHO investigation occurrence NS Kitgum / Pader region northern Uganda . A total 51 case report NS , 93 household friend control identified case control investigation additionally , 23 subject report NS enrol case series underwent thorough medical neurological assessment . Unpublished data assessment demonstrate NS seizure disorder , nod episode due atonic seizure result loss tone associate change electroencephalography ( EEG ) include multiple clinical subclinical seizure type . The surveillance data show prevalence NS part Kitgum region many-fold high would expect comparable form epilepsy , base upon data North America Europe . In case-control investigation , skin snip positivity presence O. volvulus microfilariae associate NS case , seropositivity antibody O. volvulus , 95 % case positive onchocerciasis serology compare 54 % control ( p=0.03 ) . The investigation also show low serum vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) level ( &lt; 20 ) among population child age 5 15 region whole , case control . Deficiencies vitamin A , selenium , zinc , among case control also note . The Ministry Health , Government Southern Sudan ( MoH-GoSS ) , investigate NS Witto internally displace person ( IDP ) camp Witto Payam western Equatoria September 2010 . A total 96 case register , age 5-20 year ( high age group 10-15 year ) . Head nodding , tonic-clonic partial seizure secondary generalization generalize seizure report . Based past two investigation , available data , conclude NS form epilepsy cause remain obscure ( 9 ) . In May June 2011 , team CDC assist South Sudan Ministry Health WHO investigation NS Western Equatoria State South Sudan . A total 38 case-control pair match age- village- identified case control investigation separately , 25 subject report NS enrol case series underwent thorough medical neurological evaluation ( 17 ) . The finding investigation consistent unpublished finding investigation Uganda 2009-10 , cause Nodding syndrome continue remain unknown . Currently , parent caregiver child NS report child respond locally available anti-epileptic drug ( AEDs ) differently ; report response others . These locally available AEDs include carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbitone , valproate . However , information anecdotal remain unclear whether child receive medication regular basis , dose administer adhered , whether achieve therapeutic level AEDs . The investigator therefore additionally propose two AED treatment arm conventional anti-epileptic therapy include sodium valproate phenytoin , order validate report response conventional anti-epileptic drug . Based investigation do far , child NS appear suffer multiple clinical electrographic seizure type , include generalize tonic-clonic , partial complex , atypical absence , atonic seizure . Seizures classify partial generalize , unclassified base clinical feature associate electroencephalographic finding ( Appendix Y ) . There many cause seizure , include infectious , metabolic , drug , genetic , nutritional , endocrinal , trauma . In case , etiology know , seizure refer idiopathic cryptogenic . Currently , etiology NS identify , child suffer multiple different seizure type , many child demonstrate cognitive impairment , NS could consider form cryptogenic epileptic encephalopathy . This important epilepsy difficult control standard AEDs , case , may exacerbate certain AEDs ( e.g. , carbamazepine ) ( 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ) . Thus , formal assessment effect AEDs child NS important . The finding low pyridoxine level among child assess , population Kitgum District well child assess Western Equatoria South Sudan notable , light condition know pyridoxine-dependent seizure ( PDS ) pyridoxine-responsive seizure . Hunt et al , ( 1954 ) first describe pyridoxine dependent seizure ( PDS ) ( 23 ) autosomal recessive inheritance . PDS due defective binding pyridoxine apoenzyme , glutamate decarboxylase , catalyze conversion glutamic acid , critical nutrient , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , inhibitory central nervous system neurotransmitter . The resultant reduce level GABA low seizure threshold , lead intractable seizure ( 24 , 25,26 , 27 , appendix Z ) . PDS commonly manifest among infant intractable seizure , generally begin within hour birth . Classically multiple type clinical electrographic seizure describe among individual PDS ( 24 , 28 , 29 , 30 ) . Prolonged seizure recurrent episode status epilepticus typical , also report recurrent self-limited event include partial seizure , generalize seizure , atonic seizure , myoclonic event , infantile spasm ( 27 , 30 , 31 ) . Commonly see neonate infant , atypical presentation know occur seizure onset later childhood include report child 6 year ( 26 , 27 , 32 , 33 , 34 ) . PDS diagnostic consideration instance among infant seizure intractable may control conventional anticonvulsant respond clinically electrographically pharmacologic dos pyridoxine ( 27 , 35 ) . A trial therapeutic dos B6 ( administration 100 mg pyridoxine ) indicate infant / child intractable seizure unresponsive standard anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) treatment ( 24 , 25 , 26 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ) . Intravenous intramuscular administration recommend infant ongoing seizure status epilepticus , order achieve immediate resolution seizures clinical seizure generally cease several minute hour ( 29 ) . If responsive , oral maintenance dose 2-500mg/day PO ( 15-18mg/kg/day optimally sometimes high 680mg initially 200 mg/day subsequently ) follow indefinitely ( 33 , 35 ) . Clinical seizure generally cease several minute hour . Recommended daily allowance ( RDA ) pyridoxine 0.5 mg infant 2.0 mg adult 50-100 mg pyridoxine per day ( 38 , 39 , 40 ) dosage adjustment age , intercurrent illness allow great intellectual performance exceed 500 mg/day ( 27 , 28 , 36 , 38 , 41 ) . The chance identify specificity lose pyridoxine give together , many anticonvulsant drug ( 27 ) . Daily supplementation pharmacologic dose pyridoxine accept treatment disorder . The seizure report occur among child NS appear share several feature PDS , namely multiple seizure type . However , NS represent PDS typical form ; relationship NS pyridoxine deficiency suspect light presence deficiency population . However , unpublished finding two investigation undertake separately Uganda ( 2010 ) South Sudan ( 2011 ) show deficiency B6 notice among population child ( case control ) raise possibility contributory role B6 deficiency NS . Since entire population , include child without NS , appear pyridoxine-deficient , illness attribute B6 deficiency alone ; however , possibility low B6 level may contributory factor remain therefore treatment trial pyridoxine propose PDS therapeutic diagnostic consideration setting . Because seizures child NS appear gradual onset , intermittent significant interictal period , intravenous administration pyridoxine necessary oral supplementation appropriate . B6 treatment safe . There report significant side effect B6 treatment . Apnea , lethargy hypotonia among infant soon start B6 report ( 3 5 infant Mikati , et al ) , rare ( 29 ) . Since diagnosis PDS base upon response therapeutic intervention require trial treatment , replacement may provide safe , efficacious treatment PDS , propose assess possible efficacy B6 supplementation NS form oral pyridoxine treatment evaluate response efficacy cessation reduction seizure . Dosing pyridoxine 30 - 50 mg/kg/day single daily dose . In summary , appear grow data NS seizure disorder various current treatment approach focus use antiepileptic medication . For Ugandan child disorder , current standard treatment episodic treatment multivitamin and/or antiepileptic medication , typically administer psychiatric nurse limited physician oversight . Information effectiveness treatment approach base anecdotal report , reliable systematically collect data dosage frequency medication use . In addition lack scientific data effectiveness treatment approach , important question need addressed regard possible adverse effect use antiepileptic medication child NS . Anecdotal report caregiver local treat physician suggest NS seizure appear respond variably locally available anti-epileptic drug ; however , reason outline , clearly demonstrate . In addition , several aspect treatment remain undetermined include , whether child give medication regular basis , give appropriate dos antiepileptic drug per weight , achieve therapeutic dos drug . In addition , clear whether child NS obtain clinical benefit harm AED treatment . Given knowledge nature seizure type see NS , possible NS difficult manage conventional AED approach . In fact , certain antiepileptic medication may case paradoxically exacerbate certain seizure condition ( 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ) . Such exacerbation particularly true epileptic encephalopathy . For child cryptogenic generalize epileptic disorder , AED sodium valproate ( valproic acid ) find often effective , few side effect many AEDs , consider drug choice ( 42 ) . Valproic acid currently list recommend AED WHO . The investigator therefore propose simultaneous assessment pyridoxine , valproic acid , well AED currently utilize community child NS ( phenytoin ) compare response placebo control intervention group .</detailed_description>
