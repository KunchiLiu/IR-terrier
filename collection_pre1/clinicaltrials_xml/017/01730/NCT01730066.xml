	<detailed_description>Longer surgical procedure require intubation potential risk contaminate low airway pathogenic bacteria mouth oropharynx . Surgery include mouth oropharynx perform area colonise hundred different bacterial specie . In healthy person balance different microbe possible pathogen keep control . Patients subject surgery mouth , oropharynx neck area , often cancer diagnosis . Preoperative treatment ( mostly radiation ) do case result change spectrum bacteria mouth oropharynx . Due lower appetite increased difficulty eat , combination cancer diagnosis , also change cranial direction microbiological gut flora result presence pathogen Gram-negative bacteria . Those specie may result troublesome infection postoperative period . With healthy people pathogenic bacteria originate gastro/intestinal canal seldom find oropharynx , occur among many patient . Antibiotics use prophylactic extensive surgery , micro vascular procedure free transplant tissue , antibiotic keep throughout length stay ( LOS ) hospital . This result increase risk development resistant bacteria result change GI flora patient . Diarrhoea occur frequently troublesome patient For ICU patient see reduction emerge enteric bacteria patient give oral care probiotic study explore possibility kind positive effect patient due extensive surgery perform several hour . Many patient tracheostomy performed part surgical procedure . Patients randomise ( 1:1 ) either prophylaxis ( standard procedure today ) preparation probiotic suspension fro day surgery discharge hospital . Preoperatively patient gurgle suspension probiotic swallow preparation . Postoperatively probiotics give enterally eventually responsible surgeon find suitable mouth . Cultures inclusion , intubation , predefined day postoperatively compare bacterial flora oropharynx tracheal secretion . Infectious parameter follow .</detailed_description>
