	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pertuzumab , trastuzumab , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation work treat patient human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2-positive stage II-IV breast cancer . Monoclonal antibody , pertuzumab trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way kill tumor cell stop grow . Giving pertuzumab trastuzumab together paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation may better way block tumor growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pertuzumab , Trastuzumab , Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Treating Patients With HER2-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy administration pertuzumab combination trastuzumab nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) subject stage IV human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) -2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) measure progression free survival ( PFS ) . II . To determine efficacy neoadjuvant treatment regimen HER2+ locally advance breast cancer ( LABC ) define pathologic complete response ( pCR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety pertuzumab add trastuzumab nab-paclitaxel HER-2 overexpressing MBC LABC cancer assess frequency severity adverse event ( AEs ) , abnormal finding physical examination , laboratory test , vital sign . II . To evaluate objective response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) duration response MBC . III . To evaluate efficacy regimen assess tumor response include assessment residual cancer burden ( RCB ) score LABC . IV . To assess progression free survival ( MBC ) , relapse-free survival ( LABC ) overall survival patient . V. To perform exploratory circulatory gene , micro-ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , exosome profiling well protein glycomic profiling . VI . To assess feasibility molecular profile primary metastatic tumor sample . VII . To assess numerical qualitative aspect circulate tumor cell circulate tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pertuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( patient MBC ) 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( patient LABC ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 4 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
