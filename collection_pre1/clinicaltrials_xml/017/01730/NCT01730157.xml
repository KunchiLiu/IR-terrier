	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study radioembolization ipilimumab treat patient uveal melanoma liver metastasis . Radioembolization kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor keep radioactive substance near tumor . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving radioembolization together ipilimumab may kill tumor cell patient uveal melanoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radioembolization Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Uveal Melanoma With Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To estimate safety efficacy sequential hepatic radioembolization systemic ipilimumab patient uveal melanoma metastatic liver . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect regulator tumor immunity . OUTLINE : Patients undergo radioembolization yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres via hepatic arterial infusion day 1 . Beginning day 29 , patient also receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute . Treatment ipilimumab repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
