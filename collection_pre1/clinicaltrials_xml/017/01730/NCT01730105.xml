	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study metabolism hormone level change response mild change environmental temperature . Changes metabolism may lessen time hormonal adaptation . If increase metabolism continue long period , mild cold exposure may cause weight loss . It unclear whether exposure warm temperature may cause opposite change metabolism . Researchers want see long exposure ( 1 month ) different temperature affect body use energy . Objectives : - To test change energy metabolism response different room temperature . Eligibility : - Healthy men 18 40 year age . Design : - The entire study last 4 month . It involve screen visit 4-month inpatient stay National Institutes Health Clinical Center . The inpatient stay private room Metabolic Clinical Research unit . Study participant require stay Metabolic Clinical Research unit night , free leave day . - At screen visit , participant physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . A heart function test diet questionnaire also give . - During first month , temperature private room set 75.2 degree F. This allow body become used test environment . - During second month , temperature set either cool ( 66.2 degree F ) warm ( 80.6 degree F ) temperature . - During third month , temperature return 75.2 degree F. - During fourth month , temperature alter opposite temperature one set second month . - Throughout stay , participant daily temperature monitor keep food diary . Once week , collect urine 24 hour . Once month , spend 24 hour metabolic suite study metabolism rate . - Throughout stay , food provide part study . - During first third month ( 75.2 degree F ) participant allow leave Metabolic Clinical Research unit weekend , second forth month ( 66.2 80.6 degree F ) , participant allow spend one weekend Metabolic Clinical Research unit . - Other test , body scan , fat tissue sample , image study , perform need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity major health issue worldwide . Despite global research effort , effective treatment obesity limit . There two kind fat body : white fat brown fat . White fat function mainly energy-storing organ excess result obesity complication diabetes high blood pressure . Brown fat hand release energy store fat heat . It protect small animal newborn human infant cold temperature . Recent advance image technique reveal brown fat present significant amount adult human . Using PET scanning , brown fat show abundant lean young individual , suggest brown fat may regulate energy balance metabolism . In previous study show following exposure mild cold ( 19degree C/66degree F ) , activity brown fat increase nearly 10 % energy expenditure 6 % . Over time , change might result substantial weight loss . However investigated uncertain whether long-term cold exposure sustain increase activity brown fat . In order determine therapeutic potential brown fat activation , design study investigate effect cold exposure long period . We hypothesize adult human cold-acclimatized mild cold exposure month . Brown fat activity increase sustain cold stimulation , could result beneficial metabolic change body . The aims current project : 1. determine whether brown fat stimulate exposure mild cold 2. investigate metabolic consequence long-term cold exposure Volunteers randomly assign sleep overnight Metabolic Clinical Research Unit NIH , set either mild cold ( 19degree C/66degree F ) mild warm ( 27degree C/81degree F ) , lead-in period wash-out period crossing , temperature ambient ( 24degree C/75 degree F ) . Volunteers conduct regular activity day . Each period 1 month duration . At end month , volunteer evaluate metabolic response mild cold challenge 24 hour ( 19degree C/66degree F ) determine whether brown fat function activity alter temperature acclimatization previous month . Significance : Based role energy homeostasis protection obesity animal , brown fat likely similar role adult human . Determining contribution brown fat-mediated cold acclimatization long term energy balance may lead novel treatment strategy obesity .</detailed_description>
