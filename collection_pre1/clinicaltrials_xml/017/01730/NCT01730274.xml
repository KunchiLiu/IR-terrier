	<brief_summary>Aim : To investigate effect cerebellar tumor surgery rest state functional connectivity level high order cognition network know interact cerebellum . Furthermore , correlate connectivity level network neuropsychological performance functional outcome patient . The investigator 's hypothesis functional connectivity various cognition network cerebrum assess resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging impair cerebellar tumor surgery correlate neuropsychological performance . The effect surgery cognition network neuropsychological performance dependent tumor location within cerebellum . Such correlation seem feasible functional connectivity analysis could correlate neuropsychological impairment various neuropsychiatric disorder . Furthermore , investigator able depict maturation functional connectivity network parallel neurocognitive development childhood</brief_summary>
