	<brief_summary>This study evaluate child Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity ( ADD ) respond medication , response different child problem hyperactivity inattention . In order , child age 7-11 whose primary difficulty attention problem never behavioral psychiatric medication recruit . Once enrol , child try one week 3 different dos methylphenidate , commonly prescribe Attention Deficit , Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) medication , well placebo . Children randomly assign one six possible medication dose placebo titration schedule , study doctor , family , teacher know dose ( ) child receive give week . Each week , behavioral side effect rating complete child 's parent teacher , family meet study doctor physical examination discus week go . Some child also neuropsychological test determine methylphenidate influence work memory , sustain attention , ability inhibit ( stop ) inappropriate response . All data analyze decide medication dose child respond best recommendation treatment give . Ultimately , study aim improve understand child ADHD-Primarily Inattentive Type respond stimulant medication - determine whether child experience diminish response methylphenidate compare child hyperactivity inattention - determine whether certain genetic environmental factor play role response . Findings study use help streamline identification effective dos medication child ADHD-Primarily Inattentive Type .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Robust data indicate stimulant medication reduce ADHD symptom impairment , unclear whether efficacy generalizes across ADHD subtypes . Although predominately inattentive type ( PIT ) prevalent ADHD subtype U.S. population-based study , study specifically examine response stimulant subtype . Instead , medication guideline PIT largely extrapolate study enrol mostly ADHD-combined type ( CT ) . Thus , application seek improve understand stimulant medication response predictor child PIT . We evaluate participant ' response methylphenidate ( MPH ) , widely prescribe stimulant , via prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial 3 dose condition . Our first specific aim examine MPH medication dose response child PIT ( n=120 ) CT ( n=45 ) test hypotheses participant PIT diminish MPH response derive less benefit high dos compare CT . Since one prior study examine genetic predictor MPH response variability within PIT-only sample , second specific aim ( exploratory ) determine potential role genetic polymorphism ( e.g. , DAT1 , DRD4 , NET , ADRA2A , COMT , SNAP25 , CES1 , GRM7 , LPHN3 ) MPH response child PIT ( n=120 ) , examine symptom change MPH MPH dose response curve . If identify significant difference MPH response subtypes , finding may guide clinical practice suggest effective medication strategy ( different dose schedule ) child PIT . In addition , study may yield pharmacogenetic finding , future , could enable physician tailor individual treatment plan child PIT , ameliorate current prolonged expensive practice prescribe trial error .</detailed_description>
