	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recombinant human IL15 ( rhIL15 ) administer subcutaneously . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect dose schedule rhIL15 number phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cell include : total white blood cell count ; absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) ; total number T cell natural killer ( NK ) cell , well activate T cell , T cell subset NK cell subset . II . To determine effect dose schedule rhIL15 function peripheral blood mononuclear cell include : T cell subset response recall viral antigen include cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) influenza A virus ; T cell responses non-physiologic stimulus include : phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ; NK cell cytokine ( interferon gamma [ IFN-y ] ) secretion degranulation cluster differentiation 107a ( CD107a ) expression . III . To assess tumor response rate objective response rate ( ORR ) . IV . To assess immunogenicity , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) rhIL15 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive recombinant interleukin-15 subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 1-5 week 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day ( 4 week ) 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 week .</detailed_description>
