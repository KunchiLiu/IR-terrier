	<brief_summary>The purpose Part 1 study evaluate safety tolerability dalantercept combination axitinib patient advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) determine recommend dose level dalantercept combination axitinib Part 2 . The purpose Part 2 study determine whether treatment dalantercept combination axitinib prolongs progression free survival ( PFS ) compare axitinib alone patient advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Histologically confirm , advance , predominantly clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Part 1 : Progression disease follow three line prior therapy , include least one approve VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor RCC . Adjuvant therapy permit one line prior therapy . Part 2 : Progression disease follow one VEGF pathway inhibitor RCC ( e.g . sunitinib , pazopanib , sorafenib , bevacizumab , tivozanib , cabozantinib ) inclusive adjuvant therapy document disease progression treatment . Patients may receive one additional line approve mTOR kinase inhibitor ( e.g . everolimus , temsirolimus ) . Prior exposure investigational and/or approve anticancer immune therapy permit . A minimum 1 week since last dose prior therapy ( minimum 4 week since anticancer immune therapy bevacizumab +/ interferon ) . Measurable disease evaluable Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Life expectancy least 12 week . Clinical laboratory value within acceptable range within 72 hour prior study day 1 . Key Clinically significant organ/system disease unrelated RCC judgment investigator preclude treatment dalantercept axitinib . Clinically significant cardiovascular risk . Known CNS metastases leptomeningeal disease : For Part 1 , patient CNS metastasis treat whole brain radiotherapy , gamma knife , and/or surgery consider stable CNS imaging treat corticosteroid 6 week prior study day 1 may enrol . For Part 2 , patient CNS metastasis treat stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , and/or surgery consider stable CNS image least 2 month prior enrollment treat corticosteroid 6 week prior study day 1 may enrol . Any active malignancy , RCC , chemotherapy anticancer therapy indicate . Patients adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ cancer , cancer subject diseasefree least 3 year permit . Any lesion invade encasement ≥ 180 degree around wall major blood vessel assess compute tomography ( CT ) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Radiotherapy within 2 week prior study day 1 . Lack recovery toxic effect previous treatment RCC ≤ grade 1 exception alopecia , unless stabilize adequate medical control . Patients undergoing renal dialysis . Major surgery within 4 week prior study day 1 ( patient must recover completely previous surgery prior study day 1 ) . Any active infection require antibiotic therapy within 2 week study day 1 . Anticoagulation therapy . Aspirin , antiplatelet agent , low molecular weight heparin permit unless investigator deem patient significant risk bleeding . Current use anticipate inability avoid potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitor inducer ( please refer Inlyta® [ axitinib ] prescribe information ) participation study . Peripheral edema require medical intervention within 2 week prior study day 1 . Bleeding diathesis include clinically significant platelet disorder active hemoptysis ( define bright red blood ≥ 1/2 teaspoon [ 2.5 mL ] 24 hour period ) within 6 month prior study day 1 . For clinically significant epistaxis within 4 week prior study day 1 , risk bleeding must clearly document . Known history hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) . Known active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody result . Patients sustain virologic response HCV treatment immunity HBV prior infection without cirrhosis may include . History severe ( defined ≥ grade 3 , use National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 [ NCICTCAE ] v4 current active minor version ) allergic anaphylactic reaction hypersensitivity recombinant proteins excipients ( 10 mM Tris buffer saline ) investigational agent . Any prior treatment dalantercept agent target ALK1 pathway . Any prior treatment axitinib . A morbidity ( per prescribe information ) would require start patient reduce dose axitinib . Treatment another investigational drug ( exception anticancer immune therapy ) device , approve therapy investigational use , within 5 time halflife drug within 3 week prior study day 1 half life know . Pregnant lactate female patient .</criteria>
