	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernioplasty ( TEP ) one treatment option repair primary unilateral inguinal hernia . Previous study show patient underwent TEP less post-operative pain earlier return normal activity . However , chronic pain still major issue affect quality life TEP report incidence 9.2-22.5 % . Mechanical staple commonly use method mesh fixation prevent mesh migration nerve entrapment staple cause intractable pain report . Recently several clinical trial show mesh fixation fibrin sealant ( FS ) TEP result less chronic pain increase incidence seroma . A spraying device application FS laparoscopically available achieve mesh fixation use few amount FS . In study , investigator aim compare effectiveness use fibrin spray mesh fixation reduce chronic pain TEP . The investigator perform randomize control trial allocate patient two study arm random manner . The treatment group mesh fix fibrin sealant spray , whereas control group conventional mechanical staple fixation . Operative procedure post-operative management 2 group identical . They follow-up 1-month 6-month operation evaluate operative result incidence chronic pain . Any complication relate mesh operation also record .</brief_summary>
