	<brief_summary>Left valvular heart disease become one common heart disease Western country . This disease evolve many year characterize long phase patient `` asymptomatic '' . characterize discomfort LV filling may worsen lead typically pressure increase LV pressure leave atrium ( LA ) ( 1 ) . The onset symptom unpredictable may occur stage diastolic systolic dysfunction . Ventricular dysfunction may insidious , goal detect early dysfunction , know often difficult know patient actually symptomatic . The onset symptom sign intolerance increase LV filling pressure LA , cause pulmonary hypertension . Therefore , study level LV LA filling pressure , possible noninvasive method , would identify patient apparently asymptomatic even though condition advance . Pressures fill pressure explore two method : - cardiac catheterization , direct invasive measurement method - echocardiography , indirect measurement method advantage non-invasive The goal research compare two method .</brief_summary>
