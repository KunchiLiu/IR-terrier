	<brief_summary>Survival preterm infant increase greatly year , major aim improve long term outlook baby avoid serious complication . The way baby feed early life affect short long-term health survival . Because bowels preterm infant mature , digest large volume milk feed straight away . Until gut matures , nutrition provide intravenous drip amount milk give gradually increased time . Increasing amount milk rapidly may increase risk gut complication . Increasing amount milk give slowly mean intravenous nutrition need longer ; associate risk infection proportional time intravenous line present bloodstream infant . Despite importance milk feed preterm infant , study inform best balance risk , best way increase feed infant - study set address miss information . The study compare two different speed milk feed increase , one 'faster ' one 'slower ' , within rate currently use United Kingdom neonatal unit . The study aim find either speed milk fee increase give good outcomes infant . Investigators measure variety outcome , survival without disability , infection , bowel problem , growth long-term physical mental development , well impact family National Health Service , include cost . The study lead establish team researcher run similar study , use establish network neonatal unit take part previous study .</brief_summary>
