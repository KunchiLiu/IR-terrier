	<brief_title>Safety Preliminary Efficacy Study Antibody PAT-SM6 Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label , single-centre , dose escalation phase I study design investigate safety tolerability intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion PAT-SM6 administer 90 minute . A screening examination perform within 14 day prior dose . Eligible subject receive 4 dos PAT-SM6 ( cycle 1 : Day 1 Day 3 , cycle 2 : Day 8 Day 10 ) . Subjects hospitalise least 48 hour dose administration ( i.e . Day 1 Day 5 cycle 1 Day 8 Day 12 cycle 2 ) . During hospitalisation subject constant surveillance . Subjects return ambulatory visit Days 15 , 22 , 29 36 safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) assessment . Serological staging perform baseline , Day 29 ( +/- 2 day ) Day 36 ( +/-2 day ) . Response assign International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) uniform response criterion multiple myeloma . Complete response ( CR ) confirm bone marrow aspiration ; CT scan radiograph intend clinical symptom suspicious progress disease otherwise clinically indicate . If subject show least partial response ( PR ) Day 29 Day 36 ( 4 dos ) sponsor discus Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) give additional 2 dos ( therefore maximal number dos subject 6 dos ) stag perform 14 21 day last dose administration . A completion visit perform 4 day last serological staging ( e.g . cycle 2 Day 40 ) . Four dose group ( cohort ) plan : 0.3 mg/kg follow dos 1 mg/kg , 3 mg/kg 6 mg/kg . Subjects enrol strict sequential order . Individual safety result obtain Day 5 evaluate investigator sponsor next subject dose group treat . After completion 3 subject dose group , safety result subject obtain Day 15 review DSMB decision dose escalation make . Interim dose administered increase think high . Subjects show definite sign progressive disease include hypercalcemia , new osteolytic lesion new soft tissue plasmocytoma withdrawn study time . In case dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) see subject , dose subject dose group discuss DSMB , case second DLT dose group dose escalation stop study continue next low intermediate dose level previous test dose regarded maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The MTD define dose level dose induce DLT 2 subject within one dose level .</detailed_description>
