	<brief_summary>Considering epidemic-like development worldwide , associate modification lifestyle , well enormous social economic weight , prevention type II diabetes certain central concern health system within developed country decades come . However , simple obesity concern entire population , type 2 diabetes affect one sub-population high genetic risk . To effective realistic economic term , effort prevention must thus target towards subject high risk . The key issue involve identify subject early enough strategy effective prevention organize good time . Until , effort concentrate individual risk diabetes readily identifiable within general population , typically subject second half adulthood , present abdominal obesity mild abnormality blood sugar . Preventive lifestyle dietary measure propose constrictive difficult maintain time , result , although may significant , remain disappointing , mere postponement outcome stage appear inevitable . The reason ascribable excessively tardy intervention , pathogenic process already ongoing ten year endocrine function pancreas probably already irreparably impair . The alternative thus early intervention , childhood , adolescence early adulthood . The problem identify individual high risk become diabetic time present simple clinical laboratory abnormality allow easy diagnosis . The familial character type 2 diabetes well establish , future diabetic subject child diabetic subject . However , prevalence disease among descendant type 2 diabetic subject around 20-30 % predictive tool need combat diabetes high-risk family . We propose create risk equation use algorithm reliably predict child likely develop diabetes later life . The algorithm include 3 class data : - The genotype stem genetic characterization individual parent ; - Environmental data concern childhood , especially eat habit physical activity ; - Data mother eventually diabetic pregnancy . From methodological standpoint , would rather difficult take blood sample child wait 50 year determine whether develop diabetes . To circumvent difficulty , recruit subject family history type II diabetes : - Parents alive , include least one type 2 diabetic subject - Adult child ( age 35 year ) , already present type II diabetes , healthy brother sister , form control population . Test do determine whether healthy subject really safe risk diabetes ( HbA1c measurement glucose load test ) . The Descendence study include 500 family risk involve 3000 subject ( 1000 subject diabetes 2000 healthy subject ) . It expect answer follow question : child born family risk , probability develop diabetes later life , early preventive action may take</brief_summary>
