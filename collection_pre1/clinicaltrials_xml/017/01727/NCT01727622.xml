	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine value Arterial Spin Labeling ( ASL ) MRI , measure blood flow brain , Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) compare exist measure . In particular , investigator compare ASL MRI Positron Emission Tomography ( PET/CT ) , measure brain metabolism reflect well cell patient 's brain functioning . In addition , investigator assess relationship measure specific protein level associate Alzheimer 's Disease patient 's cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid surround brain spinal cord ) obtain lumbar puncture . By compare information available procedure patient 's performance cognitive test , investigator hope learn procedure accurately reflect assist determination potential cause cognitive difficulty arise MCI , thus , useful clinical setting . In particular , PET scan find useful diagnosis MCI Alzheimer 's Disease , investigator want find get , good , information ASL MRI scan , less expensive easy acquire .</brief_summary>
