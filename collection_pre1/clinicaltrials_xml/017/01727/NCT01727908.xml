	<brief_title>Screening Familial Gastric Cancer First Degree Relatives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Familial gastric cancer ( FGC ) concern 10 % gastric cancer . It impressive impact emotional physical wellbeing first degree relative patient ( early ) onset gastric cancer . FGC 1-3 % attribute one single hereditary syndrome , hereditary diffuse gastric cancer ( HDGC ) . HDGC associate CDH1 mutation 40 % case . In case CDH1 mutation , refer familiar diffuse gastric cancer ( FDGC ) , remain uncertain guide and/or screen family member . The applies rare familial intestinal type gastric cancer ( FIGC ) . Aim : In study want determine value endoscopic screen member family FGC , FDGC FIGC . Also , analyze association life style factor , include dietary habit development FDGC , able build preventive strategy . Finally , want assess psychological impact screen protocol . Objective : Primary , determine whether stain gastric mucosa increase number detect ( pre ) malignant focus diffuse type gastric cancer , individual family FDGC well dysplastic , adenomatous early intestinal cancer individual family FIGC . Secondary : A To determine optimal pathological work-up detection rate ( pre- ) malignancy . B To determine clinical life style factor associate two type FGC . C To determine psychosocial impact screen protocol population . D To develop strategy screen individual FGC family creative advise preventive measure . Study design : A randomized control trial include prospective cohort analysis . Study population : All ( first degree ) relatives , 18 year old patient fulfill criterion FGC . These ; 1 ] first degree relative individual diffuse gastric cancer , without proven CDH1 mutation , member family 2 ] 2 individual gastric carcinoma , least one &lt; 50 yr , 3 ] 3 individual gastric carcinoma , age , type , 4 ] 1 individual type gastric carcinoma &lt; 40 yr .</detailed_description>
