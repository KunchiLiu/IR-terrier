	<brief_summary>Rehabilitation exercise conduct home follow injury improve clinical functional outcome . Optimum compliance prescribe exercise regimen require regular patient instruction , performance assessment , monitor general encouragement healthcare staff . Exercise home though convenient patient conducive provision professional support need maximize prescribed regimen effectiveness . Software development Reflexion Health Inc. along Naval Medical Center San Diego ( NMCSD ) design facilitate remote staff-patient interaction at-home rehabilitative exercise session . Microsoft Kinect® serve hardware platform design software package tentatively call , `` Reflexion . '' Kinect® contain marker-less/controller-less motion track camera . The final Reflexion software rely `` Rehabilitation Measurement Tool ( RMT ) '' detect cardinal plane skeletal joint movement velocity utilize embed Kinect® camera also provide patient visual feedback via avatar television screen . In observational minimal risk study , RMT/Kinect® functional reliability usability assess . Twenty healthy subject physically set-up turn-on hardware/software system ; receive exercise direction RMT ; conduct series knee exercise similar prescribed anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) repair . An initial limited data set , obtain Reflexion Health , provide validity reliability measure . Eighteen degrees absolute difference detect manual goniometry Kinect® measurement relevant plane movement utilized prescribe ACL exercise . Good relative agreement RMT goniometry score obtain ( ICC = 0.89 ) . A correctable systematic bias toward underestimation RMT allow future accurate estimation joint position improve face validity . RMT functional reliability general usability express study utilize descriptive statistic scale questionnaire . Hardware component malfunction ( Kinect® camera , laptop , PC , LCD television/monitor ) well RMT internally log software error failure tally measured ascertain RMT reliability . User-RMT interaction quality evaluate video recording set-up exercise session . Specifically , usability measure include : need additional assistance setting-up operate RMT ; number attempt require subject interact specific feature : time spend specific element session . Participant feedback elicit post-session use two scaled questionnaire : System Usability Scale ( SUS ) Reflexion Usability Scale ( RUS ) . Findings study guide software modification need prior implementation future clinical study within NMCSD population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . General Approach : We plan use observational study design assess reliability usability RMT healthy volunteer participate simulate session knee physical therapy present RMT . Each session supervise research staff record later review assessment area concern reliability usability . 2 . Methods : The study use 20 ( n=20 ) healthy volunteer . These subject actively recruit Naval Medical Center San Diego Orthopedic research staff . We also use informational flyer place NMCSD Physical Therapy Orthopedic outpatient clinic wait room . No medical record use identify subject recruitment . Subjects approach research staff ask participation undergo standard practice regard meeting , inclusion exclusion criterion clinical trial consent train research staff . Those consent participate take area house RMT hardware software . Subjects undergo brief 5 minute tutorial setup , power-on , navigation hardware gesture control software . After orientation session subject present RMT hardware ask connect hardware component via provided cable subsequently power system application well position correctly front camera . Next , instructed follow screen prompt enter subject ID pertinent login information navigate system use gesture . Following setup process proceed engage four exercise sequentially present RMT software . Approximately 5 repetition exercise record evaluate RMT subject ask follow onscreen prompt review summary activity present RMT exit application . After interaction RMT ask complete System Usability Scale questionnaire well Reflexion Usability Scale questionnaire . We anticipate total time require subject approximately 45 minute . Research staff available provide assistance request subject interaction RMT . Additionally , staff also intervene consented subject perform exercise detect sign impend injury harm . Subjects allow terminate involvement time reason . Review research staff note subject interaction RMT , SUS RUS result , videotape interaction subject RMT corroborate post-hoc . 1 . Sample Size We estimate sample size study approximately 20 subject . Since direct comparison make control cohort , inferential statistical analysis perform . This mean meaningful way appropriately power study via sample size adjustment . Our choice 20 subject , therefore , base balance logistics require test platform collect sufficient data understand usability system . 2 . Randomization 3 . Blinding 4 . Initial Orientation Session Subjects give brief video tutorial connect Kinect camera television laptop , power RMT Kinect camera , operate RMT hardware software research staff ; question answer time regard RMT operation . Then , subject evaluate licensed , currently practice physical therapist show four exercise perform session . The therapist work patient achieve satisfactory performance exercise , assess therapist . 3 . Components - Hardware : - Kinect Camera - LCD Television - Laptop PC - Software : - Windows 7 Operating System - Rehabilitation Measurement Tool Software Application 4 . Statistical Analysis : The primary goal research understand usability reliability system . Since present application relatively novel , standard mthods 'success ' 'failure ' system . Therefore , intend perform inferential statistical analysis . Rather , generate descriptive statistic use post-hoc fashion determine system reliability , usability future application sick patient undergo physical therapy post-ACL reconstruction surgery . Descriptive statistic provide good insight data allow informed assessment potential risk system . Understanding distributional nature data ( e.g. , normal symmetric , normal skew , bimodal , etc . ) variability data score well identify overall safety risk well help specify individual could potentially incur great safety risk , one exist .</detailed_description>
