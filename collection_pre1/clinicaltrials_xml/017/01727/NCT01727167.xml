	<brief_summary>This study test inhalation Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) increase number mitochondria heart muscle . Mitochondria small component muscle cell convert fuel oxygen easily usable form energy ( ATP ) power cell 's activity . Adequate number healthy mitochondria essential heart cell function . From animal study reason believe breathe small amount CO signal body increase number mitochondria heart cell . We propose test theory heart valve surgery patient examine small sample heart tissue ( right atrial appendage ) routinely cut preparation patient cardio-pulmonary bypass would otherwise discarded surgeon . Muscle sample two group subject compare . One group breath CO group breath room air . If CO effective , notice increase number mitochondria group expose CO compare group breathe room air .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE : Endogenously produce carbon monoxide ( CO ) know act physiologic signal molecule induce mitochondrial biogenesis . This study test low-level CO preconditioning induces myocardial biogenesis human clinical benefit derive . STUDY ACTIVITIES AND POPULATION : The study interventional , prospective , randomize , double-blinded trial 2-week follow period . Forty subject recruit population patient schedule undergo elective aortic valve replacement . For safety purpose patient coronary disease exclude . Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize receive either air air contain CO @ 200ppm one-hour inhalational treatment per day course three day immediately prior schedule operation . Biochemical marker mitochondrial biogenesis ( blood right atrial tissue ) clinical outcome parameter ( BUN/creatinine , leave ventricular function measure 2D echo ) measure patient pre post-operatively . Right atrial tissue sample collect tissue routinely excise placement venous cannula cardiopulmonary bypass . RISK/SAFETY &amp; DATA ANALYSIS : Risks CO inhalation blood drawing . The 200ppm dose choose within OSHA work place exposure limit use safely human subject previously . Data analyze compare biogenetic marker level clinical parameter pre post intervention control CO treatment group .</detailed_description>
