Based indication , cancer patient unsuspected pulmonary embolism would anticoagulated least 6 month disease active , case would mean indefinite treatment . In fact , dedicated study treatment unsuspected pulmonary embolism miss , leave doubt need ( indefinite ) anticoagulation expose patient increase risk major bleed event . Concerns need anticoagulant treatment may especially hold pulmonary embolism distal pulmonary tree since segmental sub-segmental PE seem benign course proximal embolism . The scope study evaluate current treatment approach unsuspected pulmonary embolism ass efficacy safety large prospective cohort cancer patient .</brief_summary>
