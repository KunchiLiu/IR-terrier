	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well bevacizumab without anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 ( TRC105 ) work treat patient kidney cancer spread part body ( metastatic ) . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without TRC105 Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival 12 24 week bevacizumab alone combination TRC105 ( anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Toxicity Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) response rate combination compare single agent bevacizumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tumor tissue expression endoglin ( CD105 ) , transform growth factor , beta receptor II ( TGFBR2 ) , activin A receptor type II-like 1 ( ACVRL1 ) transform growth factor , beta receptor 1 ( TGFBR1 ) kinase pre- post-treatment tissue sample order determine whether CD105 stem cell activation occur exposure anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) therapy predict laboratory model , whether exposure anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 affect change . II . To compare soluble CD105 level baseline treatment group receive bevacizumab alone group receive bevacizumab combination anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 . III . To compare TGFBR2 level baseline treatment group receive bevacizumab alone group receive bevacizumab combination anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 . IV . To evaluate whether circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) detect patient population use parylene membrane filter technology , whether change CTC count CD105 expression CTCs therapy correspond image clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab Arm I anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV 1-4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
