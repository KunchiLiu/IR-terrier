	<brief_summary>Irradiation Accelerated Partial Breast ( IPAS ) day remain therapeutic concept whose validity assess non-inferiority term local control compare whole breast irradiation . At least eight phase III trial attempt answer question thus provide sufficient level evidence make concept new standard care sub-groups patient well define ( 1 ) . However , without wait final result randomize trial ( fully valid drop least ten year ) , American society ( ASTRO ) European ( ESTRO ) radiotherapy two propose classification ( similar ) 3 group accord risk patient term local recurrence IPAS . And define ESTRO : - The low-risk group ( `` suitable '' ASTRO ) - The intermediate-risk group ( `` cautionary '' ASTRO ) - The high-risk group ( `` suitable '' ASTRO ) ( 2.3 ) . Therefore , possible propose patient randomize clinical tria IPAS , subject belongs group `` low risk . '' The result phase II trial long-term analysis match team William Beaumont Hospital ( 4 ) phase III trial use intra-operative radiation photon low energy X whose result recently publish ( 5 ) confirm value new therapeutic concept post-operative breast cancer low risk local recurrence . In France , therapists quickly direct sub-population IPAS could represent real improvement therapeutic management significantly reduce number irradiation session thirty 6 week 5 day 10 single view ( 6 ) . Several French phase II trial start specifically target female population age use balloon catheter ( MammoSite ® ) ( 7 ) intra-operative radiation électronthérapie ( 8 ) . The result test use GERICO-03 brachytherapy high dose rate ( promoter : FNCLCC , National Federation Anti Cancer Centres , recently merge Group Health Cooperation entitle UNICANCER ) currently submit Journal Green Radiotherapy ( Radiotherapy Oncology 09/11/11 ) ( 9 ) . On technical level , two main approach use ( 10 ) : - Irradiation intraoperative electron low-energy photon , - Radiation surgery The advantage intraoperative irradiation optimal reduction total processing time radio-surgery patient irradiate lumpectomy . However , 15-20 % patient receive partial breast irradiation , histo-prognostic criterion provide histologically final report , confirm non-adapted indication IPAS ( 5 ) . In contrast , post-operative IPAS treat patient meet criterion IPAS treatment-related travel 5 treatment bi-fractionated ( 2 session per day separate least 6 hour ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single dose intraoperative issue electrontherapy low energy photon ( 50 Kv ) 21 Gy ( 5.11 ) . However , dos report irradiated volume equivalent . Indeed , electrontherapy , complete volume mammary parenchyma irradiate , whereas low energy photon therapy ( X 50 KV ) `` shell '' 5 mm thick treat know 10 mm surface sphere treatment , gland receive 50 % dose initially prescribe . On interstitial brachytherapy high dose rate , dose escalation due intrinsic volume locate within irradiated area receive high dose prescribe ( 12 ) . It variation dose within target volume efficiency , also induce toxicity interstitial brachytherapy . The linear quadratic model calculate biological equivalence 2 Gy irradiation scheme often hypofractionned , theoretically applicable dos per fraction le 8 Gy . Nevertheless , author use IPAS intra-operative ( electron , photon ) apply method calculation dose 21 Gy one fraction . In study , propose treat patient total dose 16 Gy one fraction . This dose calculate take account report alpha/beta breast , order 3.4 Gy late toxicity 4.6 Gy local control ( 13 ) . Applying linear-quadratic model alpha/beta breast 4 , 16 Gy one fraction calculate radio-biologically equivalent 53 Gy conventional fractionation ( 14,15 ) . Biological Equivalence dose dose protocol IPAS intraoperative electron X-ray photon 50 kV ( 21 Gy one fraction , 87 Gy EQD2 alpha/beta 4.6 ) ( 5.8 ) post-operative irradiation 34-38 Gy 10 fraction , 5 day ( 42 Gy EQD2 alpha/beta 4.6 .</detailed_description>
