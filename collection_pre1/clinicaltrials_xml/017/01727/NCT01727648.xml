	<brief_title>Effects RAT Sequential Combination With CIT Stroke Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal research project provide scientific evidence robot-assisted therapy sequential combination distribute constraint-induced therapy ( RT + dCIT ) versus monotherapy robot-assisted therapy ( RT ) , distribute constraint-induced therapy ( dCIT ) , dose-matched control therapy ( DMCT ) stroke rehabilitation . The specific aim propose research identify follow : 1 . The investigator investigate treatment effect RT + dCIT compare RT , CIT , DMCT motor ability , muscle function , sensory function , daily performance , real-world arm activity , quality life , motor control variables treatment , midterm assessment , treatment . In addition study treatment benefit , physiological response potential adverse effect include post-exertional fatigue , post-exertional pain , biomarker oxidative stress also examine project . The investigator hypothesize therapeutic regimen combine RT dCIT contribute significantly reduction impairment disability stroke patient intervention group . 2 . The investigator investigate clinical characteristic behavioral marker stroke patient influence outcomes intervention . The propose potential predictor chronicity , side lesion , muscle tone , motor ability distal part upper limb , amount affect hand use . 3 . The investigator examine whether improved score treatment reach clinically important change order establish clinical significance relevant individualized medicine . The investigator also assess compare clinimetric property ( e.g. , validity , responsiveness , minimal detectable change , minimal clinically important difference ) rehabilitation outcome inform selection instrument .</detailed_description>
