	<criteria>Subjects good health ( except additional/ specific inclusion criterion relate hepatic impaired subject ) determine past medical history , physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram , laboratory test significance screen Subjects must weigh least 45 kg participate study , must body mass index ( BMI ) ( 18.535.0 kg/m2 ) Subjects must able communicate well investigator , understand requirement study agree use strict contraception 16 week last BKM120 dose Additional inclusion criterion Group 1 control healthy subject Subjects match hepatic impaired subject group 2 gender , age ( ± 10 year ) , weight ( ± 20 % ) , BMI ( ±5 % ) Additional inclusion criterion Group 2 hepatic impaired subject Subjects physical sign consistent stable hepatic impairment ChildPugh Clinical Assessment Score consistent degree hepatic impairment ( mild , moderate severe ) Subjects must free significant medical disorder unrelated subject 's hepatic disorder judge investigator . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L Platelet count ≥ 50 x 109 /L serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Significant illness , include infection , hospitalization within 2 week prior dose , except hepatic impaired subject due liver disease may affect significant medical problem require frequent hospitalization . Invasive systemic fungal infection need fully resolve prior study entry Use tobacco product within 2 week prior dose study . Consumption alcohol within 2 day prior dose study Subjects know ongoing alcohol or/drug abuse within 1 month prior dose , evidence abuse indicate laboratory assay conduct screen and/or baseline Subjects willing avoid certain study prohibit food , drink , counter medicine supplement Any surgical medical condition might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , may jeopardize subject case participation study . Medical history cardiac disease and/or clinically significant ECG abnormality . History clinically significant hematologic , renal , endocrinologic , pulmonary cardiovascular , hepatic , allergic disease medically document Medical history relevant psychiatric disorder Subjects Diabetes Mellitus subject glucose level normal range judge investigator History immunodeficiency disease , include Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , confirm ( HIV1 , HIV2 ) test Additional exclusion criterion Group 1 ( match healthy control subject ) History presence liver disease liver injury indicate abnormal liver function profile A positive Hepatitis C test positive Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Additional exclusion criterion Group 2 hepatic impaired subject Subjects clinically significant abnormal finding , consistent clinical disease , upon physical examination , ECG laboratory evaluation Any evidence progressive liver disease ( within last 4 week prior screen visit ) indicate liver transaminase , alkaline phosphatase GGT ≥ 50 % worsen serum bilirubin prothrombin time Total bilirubin &gt; 6mg/dl Subject ascites require intervention</criteria>
