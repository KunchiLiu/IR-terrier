	<brief_summary>Introduction : Ineffective platelet production proven play role etiology Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) addition increase platelet destruction . The second-generation thrombopoietin ( TPO ) mimetics show good efficacy boost platelet count great majority patient chronic ITP several clinical trials.1 , 2 Nevertheless , 20 % patient ITP fail respond TPO mimetic treatment . Those treatment-resistant patient un-characterized reason lack response study . The identification predictive blood biomarkers patient ' response treatment useful reduce cost potential side effect ; equal importance interest investigate molecular mechanism underlie patient ' heterogeneous response TPO mimetic treatment . Specific Aims : 1 . To identify blood classifier gene correlate patient ' response TPO mimetic treatment . 2 . To compare blood gene expression change responder non-responders TPO mimetic treatment explore possible molecular mechanism account non-responsiveness treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Identification validation response-predictive gene . The normalized pre-treatment microarray data training set retrieve SMD statistical analysis . The supervised analysis SAM ( Significance Analysis Microarrays , two class unpaired ) perform identify gene whose expression significantly different responder non-responders . Then Leave-one-out cross-validated gene-expression predictor 2 response class devise PAM ( Predication Analysis Microarrays ) method base nearest shrunken centroid . The unsupervised clustering independent test set perform use predictive gene prediction accuracy calculate . Quantitative real-time PCR perform validation use un-amplified RNA sample Taqman gene expression assay ( Applied Biosciences ) . 2 . Gene expression change correlate TPO mimetic treatment pathway analysis . 2.1 . Hypothesis : The transcriptional profile patient respond TPO agonist different respond . Plan : The expression data pre-treatment well 1-week 1-month initiation treatment sample retrieve SMD . The two class pair SAM analysis perform compare pre-treatment sample sample collect either 1-week 1-month initiation treatment responder non-responders . The two class unpaired SAM analysis also use compare post-treatment sample responder non-responders time point . The significant gene ( q value &lt; 0.05 , fold change &gt; 2.5 ) subsequently analyze IPA ( Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ) system transform set relevant network base extensive record maintain Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base . The statistically significant network , molecular cellular function , top canonical pathway toxicity list associate pair dataset recognize analysis . Hypothesis non-response TPO mimetics generate base different functional subset significant gene . Genes involve important pathway identify IPA analysis validate QRT-PCR recent publication oxidative stress pathway ITP4 . Our goal develop biomarkers predict likelihood response therapy identify pathway associate resistance therapy could target . 2.2 Hypothesis : Since available TPO agonist different mechanism action , may differences responder non-responders different drug . Plan : We recognize TPO agonist different mechanism action could affect downstream signal pathway transcriptional response . For reason addition evaluate TPO agonist group 2.1 , patient also analyze type agonist . The conclusion type analysis limited number individual treat particular drug could useful hypothesis generation confirmation large cohort .</detailed_description>
