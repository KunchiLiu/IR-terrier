	<detailed_description>Three different iso-caloric beverage test double-blinded crossover design , 24 participant randomly assign sequence test day separate least 5 day . Prior test day , participant follow standardize fasting procedure : abstention alcohol hard physical activity 24 h ; furthermore , consumption even meal later 8 pm night meal test , time point fast . They allow 500 mL water 8 pm morning test day . On test day , participant meet department fast state . After void weigh , venflon catheter insert antecubital vein , allow repeat blood sample throughout test day . Baseline measurement blood pressure , blood sample , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) score conducted time point -15 min . A second baseline blood sample drawn time point 0 , immediately participant consume preload beverage ( time point 0 ) 10 min time limit consumption . After consumption preload beverage , blood sample take VAS score complete time point 15 30 min , hereafter standardize breakfast serve 15 minute allow ( time point 30 min ) . After participant finish breakfast , blood sample draw VAS score complete time point 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 210 240 min . Hereafter , ad libitum meal consist Pasta Bolognese serve , energy intake calculate , final VAS score complete time point 270 min participant finish lunch . Before leave , participant fill questionnaire relate gastrointestinal adverse event ( AE ) . As pilot study , first 6 participant finish study invite participate fourth test day , capsule contain alginate fiber administer together placebo beverage . This fourth test day include randomization blind participant .</detailed_description>
