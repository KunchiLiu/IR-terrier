	<brief_summary>Purpose : Borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) complex psychiatric disease uncertain aetiology pathogenesis . A key mechanism disease susceptibility treatment response could epigenetic change DNA methylation pattern . However , study yet demonstrate psychotherapy exert therapeutic effect epigenetic mechanism . The main aim study analyze promoter methylation pattern gene consider related development psychopathology BPD , particular brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) glucocorticoid receptor gene , effect mentalization base treatment ( MBT ) change . Associations change BDNF serum level salivary cortisol level , well key component BPD aetiology core treatment target MBT , also investigate . Should epigenetic mechanism importance BPD pathology effect treatment , potential use DNA methylation pattern valid biomarker measure diagnosis , prognosis , treatment response . Hypothesis : The formation maintenance symptom BPD mediate neuropsychiatric mechanism affect psychological treatment . Specifically , aberrant epigenetic regulation neuropsychiatric gene relate behavioural control affect regulation , well BDNF cortisol level , ameliorate therapeutic process . Method : Fifty female patient diagnose BPD undergo year intensive MBT design target domain BPD pathology . The patient assess baseline every 6 month treatment period . Matched healthy control subject assess 6 month interval compare change DNA methylation , BDNF serum level , salivary cortisol level , neuropsychological test performance . To link component neuropsychiatric mechanism underlie onset illness , course , response treatment , patient undergo assessment clinical symptom , comorbidity pattern psychosocial impairment . Patients control subject baseline undergo assessment childhood trauma , self-harm , suicidal behavior , early maladaptive schema , personality trait , within 1-year study period also undergo continuous assessment change symptoms dissociation , depression , personality dysfunction .</brief_summary>
