	<brief_summary>The overall purpose study assess impact preclinical airway manikin training use Airtraq Avant Wireless Monitor System simulate difficult airway condition ( c-collar swell tongue ) clinical learn curve use device/system airways predictor difficult intubation . The investigator hypothesize clinical learning curve airways predictor difficult intubation shorter study subject ( operator ) undergo preclinical manikin training simulate difficult airway condition compare Study subject ( operator ) receive training . The clinical learning curve characterize procedure time first attempt success rate successive us Airtraq Avant Wireless Monitor System patient least one predictor difficult intubation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Manikin Training Airtraq Avant Learning Curve Predicted Difficult Airways</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tracheal intubation ( placement breathing tube vocal cord trachea ) essential skill anesthesia provider . Training use new technology ( i.e. , procedural training ) , include video/optical laryngoscopy ( e.g. , Airtraq Avant , Glidescope , similar device ) usually occur tutelage learn practitioner , care actual patient operate room , didactic session classroom . Although use airway trainer ( manikin ) lead improved clinical learn curve use airway device , know training use Airtraq Avant Wireless Monitor System simulate difficult airway condition ( c-collar swell tongue ) improve learn curve use device/system clinically patient least one predictor difficult intubation . The specific aim study compare clinical learning curve , characterize procedure time first attempt success rate successive us , use Airtraq Avant Wireless Monitor System patient least one predictor diffcult intubation anesthesia provider receive preclinical airway manikin training simulate difficult airway condition ( c-collar swell tongue ) . The subject study anesthesia provider enrol study . Secondary specific aim include assess impact preclinical airway manikin training simulate difficult airway condition glottic view grade , glottic view attainment maneuver , ease Airtraq Avant insertion , ease tracheal tube insertion , mechanisms tracheal tube insertion impediment , perceive overall clinical usefulness airways predictor difficult intubation .</detailed_description>
