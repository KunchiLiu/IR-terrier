	<brief_title>Dalantercept Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) patient persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma , treat dalantercept . II . To determine frequency severity adverse event associate treatment dalantercept assess Active Version National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-B ) , activin receptor-like kinase 1 ( ALK1 ) , cluster differentiation 105 ( CD105 ) , marker via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) determine correlation expression clinical response treatment . II . To determine correlation ALK1 gene expression , marker , clinical response treatment . III . To determine correlation concentration VEGF , bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) 9 , BMP10 , ALK1 pre-cycle 1 plasma use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , clinical response treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive dalantercept subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
