	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) become modality choice image gastrointestinal wall surround structure . EUS use diagnostic purpose also useful tissue acquisition fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) thus help diagnosis treatment various lesion . EUS-FNA routinely use sample various cystic solid lesion involve pancreas , liver , gastric wall , adrenal gland , kidney well lymph node area adjacent gastrointestinal tract . EUS-FNA perform pass needle work channel locate within echoendoscope . The needle pass endoscope plane ultrasound sensor , allow operator visualize path needle . This allow direct needle puncture lesion avoidance structure blood vessel . After needle pass lesion interest , vary degree suction apply obtain aspirate . The needle withdrawn scope channel aspirate push needle either stylet use syringe pump air flush aspirate cyto-pathological evaluation . The cell obtain needle aspiration help differentiate benign malignant , also tell origin tumor malignant . One advantage EUS-FNA sample quickly stain processed procedure room diagnosis give endosonographer procedure . The cyto pathologist unable provide accurate diagnosis site least able assess adequacy cellularity . This optimal center 5-6 needle pass routinely make cell sent cytopathological laboratory examination , preparation cell block etc. , . The ability make accurate diagnosis , , dependent quality sample obtain . Not center capability site cytopathologist assess cellularity make diagnosis bedside . Moreover cellularity inadequate diagnosis uncertain , patient undergo repeat procedure result increased cost , risk also agony wait diagnosis . ROLE OF SUCTION IN EUS-FNA It believe apply suction needle within desired lesion , improve quality aspirate . However , recently trend use less suction provide `` less bloody '' specimen . The randomized trial compare suction non suction technique observe high sensitivity negative predictive value malignancy suction group compare non-suction group . In addition , bloodiness contamination increase suction group . Current suction technique involve suction aspirate needle air column . The needle flushed liquid prior pass desire solid lesion . Suction apply needle within lesion lead aspiration tissue needle . This standard technique do without stylet . There data favor non use stylet . WET SCTION TECHNIQUE : Wet suction technique involve flush needle 1-2 cc saline replace column air saline . The needle pass desired lesion . Suction apply maximal strength needle move back forth within lesion obtain aspirate . Drops saline see move suction syringe aspirate move needle . Needle withdrawn aspirate deliver slide use stylet flush air needle syringe HYPOTHESIS The effect suction purpose aspirate cell / tissue fine needle biopsy may significantly improve fill column needle less compressible fluid .
