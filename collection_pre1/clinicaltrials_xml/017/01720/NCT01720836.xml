	<brief_summary>All subject receive vaccine subcutaneously every 3 week x 3 every 3 month 3 year . The rationale use Poly-ICLC adjuvant two ongoing trial University Pittsburgh Cancer Institute ( UPCI ) MUC1 100mer peptide vaccine - one therapeutic vaccine subject metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer subject advance colonic adenoma risk develop colon cancer . The formulation , MUC1 100mer peptide admix Poly-ICLC , use trial . There toxicity observe vaccine highly immunogenic early disease . In proposed NSCLC trial anti-MUC1 immune response thoroughly characterize .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) All subject must one follow stage : Stage IA ( T1NO ) ; IB ( T2NO ) , II &amp; IIIA ( N2 negative ) ; IIIA ( N2+ ) , IIIB ( N3+ ) Patients must stable disease time enrollment Women men least 18 year age ECOG performance status 01 ( Appendix A ) Subjects must within 4 6 week standard care treatment particular stage disease Subjects must acceptable organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/µL Absolute Neutrophils &gt; 1,500/µL Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL Total Bilirubin within normal institutional limit Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject normal AST ALT alkaline phosphatase within &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal The effect MUC1vaccine develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , men woman childbearing potential must willing use effective contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) study treatment least 3 month thereafter . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately Subjects may receive investigational agent Positive ANA lab result Known Hepatitis B immunomodulators ( i.e . interferon ) Known Hepatitis C immunomodulators ( i.e . interferon ) No prior vaccine therapy Patients may receive steroid antiimmune therapy time registration . Subjects must 6 week standard care treatment particular stage disease Subjects must postobstructive pneumonia serious infection time registration serious underlie medical condition would impair ability subject receive protocol treatment Prior resection lung cancer allow , least five year elapse previous resection registration Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Pregnant woman exclude study . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test Subjects immune deficiency expect respond vaccine . Therefore , know HIVpositive patient exclude study Subjects history know autoimmune disease exclude study</criteria>
