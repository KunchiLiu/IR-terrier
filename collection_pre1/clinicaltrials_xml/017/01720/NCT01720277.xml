	<brief_title>High Dose Influenza Vaccine Nursing Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower respiratory tract infection ( LRI ) , include pneumonia , bronchitis , tracheobronchitis , lead cause mortality hospitalization old adult nurse home ( NH ) resident . Often , sign symptom pneumonia , particular , apparent elderly patient , make diagnosis complicate . In addition , clinician visit resident sporadic radiological facility readily available . LRI may may directly lead hospitalization , LRIs associate considerable morbidity result hospitalization . Hospitalization rate NH resident vary considerably facility , majority hospitalization occur 12 week influenza peaks year . Influenza vaccination associate reduced hospitalization , stroke , heart attack death non-institutional older adult population , benefit influenza vaccine old population question . The new HD influenza vaccine considerably immunogenic old adult , recently approve use individual age 65 year old . No clinical data yet confirm whether improved immunogenicity translate added clinical benefit , reduction hospitalization death . The primary objective : 1. estimate difference all-cause hospitalization rate flu season experience long stay nursing home resident , facility use HD vaccine vs. facility use SD vaccine , pilot data inform feasibility , design power calculation subsequent large study . 2 . To develop estimate , nurse home resident level , relationship influenza vaccination status ( none , SD , HD ) Medicare Minimum Data Set ( MDS ) cod claim all-cause hospitalization overall mortality among long-stay resident single season 2012-2013 , use subsequent longitudinal evaluation national nursing home data regional publicly report influenza severity .</detailed_description>
