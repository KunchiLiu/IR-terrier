	<brief_summary>GABHS common etiological agent acute pharyngitis . However , local data limit large scale surveillance study do . This study aim evaluate disease burden community due GABHS . In study , patient present sign acute pharyngitis evaluate . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion test Rapid Antigen Detection test ( RADT )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pharyngitis common reason patient ' visit doctor . Group A beta- hemolytic streptococci ( GABHS ) account 15-30 percent case acute pharyngitis child 5 20 percent adults1 . Because sign symptom GABHS pharyngitis overlap extensively infectious cause , make diagnosis base solely clinical finding difficult . In patient acute febrile respiratory illness , physicians accurately differentiate bacterial viral infection use history physical finding one half time.2 No single element patient 's history physical examination reliably confirm excludes GABHS pharyngitis.3 Sore throat , fever sudden onset ( temperature great 100.4° F [ 38° C ] ) , exposure Streptococcus within precede two week suggest GABHS infection . Cervical node lymphadenopathy pharyngeal tonsillar inflammation exudate common sign . Palatal petechiae scarlatiniform rash highly specific uncommon ; swollen uvula sometimes note . Cough , coryza , conjunctivitis , diarrhea common viral pharyngitis . The original Centor score use four sign symptom estimate probability acute streptococcal pharyngitis adult sore throat.4 The score later modify add age validate 600 adult children.5,6 The cumulative score determines likelihood streptococcal pharyngitis . Rapid Antigen Detection Tests ( RADTs ) develop identification GABHS directly throat swab . Although rapid test expensive blood agar culture , provide result faster . Rapid identification treatment patient streptococcal pharyngitis reduce risk spread group A b-hemolytic streptococci , allow patient return school work sooner , reduce acute morbidity associate illness . The use RADTs certain population ( e.g. , patient emergency department ) show significantly increase number patient appropriately treat streptococcal pharyngitis , compare use traditional throat cultures.7 The great majority RADTs currently available excellent specificity 95 % , compare blood agar plate culture . This mean false-positive test result unusual , , therefore , therapeutic decision make confidence basis positive test result . Unfortunately , sensitivity test 80 % -90 % , even low , compare blood agar plate culture . It suggest false-negative RADT result occur patient merely Streptococcus carrier truly infect . However , early study first-generation RADTs demonstrate large proportion patient false-negative RADT result truly infected group A b-hemolytic streptococci merely carriers.8 Acute pharyngitis commonly encounter clinic hospital across Pakistan . It common child also among adult . Limited data available prevalence condition exist data small single center base study . The available data Pakistan suggest common bacterial organism GABHS , however , majority throat swabs yield isolate.9 The sign symptom GABHS pharyngitis overlap extensively infectious cause , thus make etiologic diagnosis base solely clinical finding difficult . Improving diagnosis bacterial cause pharyngitis lead rational use antibiotic among clinician , potentially positive impact development bacterial resistance community acquire infection . The modified Centor score valid tool estimate probability acute streptococcal pharyngitis patient sore throat . ( reference ) Patients score zero 1 low risk streptococcal pharyngitis require testing ( i.e. , throat culture rapid antigen detection test [ RADT ] ) antibiotic therapy . Patients score 2 3 test use RADT throat culture ; positive result warrant antibiotic therapy . Patients score 4 high high risk streptococcal pharyngitis , empiric treatment may consider . ( reference ) RADT allow earlier treatment , symptom improvement , reduce disease spread .</detailed_description>
