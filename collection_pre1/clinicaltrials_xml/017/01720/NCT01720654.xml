	<brief_summary>Expedited Partner Therapy ( EPT ) show reduce rate persistent recurrent gonorrhea chlamydia infection heterosexual patient , evaluate use among men sex men ( MSM ) . CDC guideline support use EPT partner management heterosexual patient , note absence evidence necessary make equivalent recommendation use EPT MSM . Randomized clinical trial assess impact EPT partner notification , treatment , STI re-infection among MSM critical development evidence-based partner management guideline . Recent data urban Peru identify prevalence rectal pharyngeal gonorrhea chlamydia range 5-20 % . The elevated burden disease among MSM Peru suggest frequent transmission undiagnosed gonorrhea chlamydia MSM sexual network may factor contribute persistently high incidence HIV infection among MSM region . The investigator propose pilot evaluation effect EPT partner notification treatment among MSM Peru diagnose gonorrhea chlamydia anatomic site . Specific Aim 1 : To explore social norm structural factor influence partner notification treatment among MSM Peru . Specific Aim 2 : To determine effect EPT anticipate actual partner notification among MSM diagnose gonorrhea chlamydia infection . Specific Aim 3 : To develop preliminary data rate gonococcal chlamydial re-infection among MSM randomize receive EPT compare standard partner notification counseling . The propose study provide pilot data use EPT MSM diagnose gonorrhea chlamydia form basis subsequent Phase III clinical trial EPT STI control method among MSM Latin America .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To determine effect Expedited Partner Therapy ( EPT ) anticipate actual partner notification among MSM diagnose gonorrhea chlamydia infection . The investigator believe provision EPT alter behavioral social context STI management MSM partnership couple act partner treatment partner notification . As result , investigator hypothesize MSM provide EPT report high rate partner notification treatment compare men receive standard partner notification counseling . Quantitative analysis partner notification outcome , use specific example participant ' five recent sex partner , provide broad estimate notification treatment behavior within study population . Individual in-depth interview diverse sub-set participant use provide interpretive depth regard behavioral , social , structural issue associate anticipated actual partner notification treatment specific interpersonal context , address logistical issue relate implementation intervention accuracy study 's outcome measure assess participant ' experience partner management . Specific Aim 2 : To collect preliminary data rate gonorrhea chlamydia re-infection among MSM randomize receive EPT compare standard partner notification counseling . The investigator anticipate MSM provide EPT low prevalence persistent recurrent urethral , rectal , pharyngeal gonorrhea and/or chlamydia infection one-month follow-up visit compare men receive standard partner notification counseling . Due exploratory nature propose study , investigator design protocol evaluation clinical effectiveness EPT STI re-infection among MSM . However , data collect provide essential preliminary information behavioral , social , epidemiologic context partner management among MSM Peru need design future clinical trial use EPT network-based strategy STI control among MSM . Participants select participation study depend finding EPT/Partner Notification Screening Protocol . Participants EPT/Partner Notification Screening Protocol diagnose urethritis and/or proctitis , Gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia urethra , rectum , oropharynx eligible enrollment EPT trial protocol . I . Recruitment : Participants EPT/Partner Notification Screening Protocol diagnose Study Physician clinical urethritis proctitis , diagnose laboratory-confirmed Gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia infection invite Study Counselor participate EPT Intervention Protocol . II . Informed Consent : All potential subject receive explanation study procedures risk benefit ask provide write Informed Consent . Participants give opportunity take Informed Consent Document home review decide late time wish participate study . III . Enrollment : Subjects consent participate EPT Intervention Protocol randomize either Intervention ( EPT ) Standard Care ( Partner Notification Counseling ) arm . IV Randomization : Eligible subject provide consent participate randomly assign intervention control group use random permute block allocation ( block size=7 alternate 4/3 ratio ) . Computer-generated randomization assignment store opaque , seal envelope open time allocation . Randomization assignment record identify participant 's numeric study code . V. Intervention Delivery . Participants assign EPT intervention provide standard partner notification counsel well maximum 5 EPT packet distribute recent ( within 3 month ) sex partner . EPT packets contain Cefixime 400 mg Azithromycin 1g pill form , well card provide information gonorrhea chlamydia infection , risk benefit antibiotic provide ( include allergic reaction ) , importance test HIV STIs . Participants randomize control arm receive standard partner notification counsel study staff . Following delivery intervention , appointment schedule participant return research site 1 month . VI . Follow-up Evaluation . All participant ask return study site 2-4 week enrollment randomization . At Follow-up evaluation , participant complete brief survey undergo repeat test gonorrhea/chlamydia . VII . Survey : Participants complete brief follow-up survey assess actual notification treatment outcome recent partner generally three recent partner specifically , well factor impede and/or promote partner notification treatment . Participants ask specify whether partner notify , whether receive antibiotic treatment and/or seek HIV/STI testing , participant 's degree certainty outcome , reason partner notify and/or treat . VIII . Specimen Collection : Samples urine , rectal pharyngeal swab collect follow : -Physical Examination : The study physician conduct brief physical examination clinical history ass sign symptom STIs , include urethritis , proctitis , genital ulcer disease . During physical examination , study physician obtain swabs rectum oropharynx . While perform pharyngeal exam , physician use new Aptima GenProbe collection kit obtain swab tonsillar pillar . While perform rectal examination , physician use new Aptima GenProbe collection kit obtain swab anorectal canal . Participants also give option self-collect rectal swab specimen . No urethral swab obtain study . Findings physical exam clinical history record Case Report Form ( CRF ) identify participant 's numeric study code . -Specimen Collection : Following physical examination , participant ask provide urine sample . Participants also instruct collect 20 mL clean , first-catch urine specimen sterile container . IX . Laboratory Testing : All sample test presence Gonorrhea Chlamydia U.S . Naval Medical Research Unit Laboratory . Participants ask return study site 14 day result repeat Gonorrhea Chlamydia test . Participants recurrent persistent infection receive second course treatment accord treatment protocol describe . All participant recurrent persistent infection receive additional counseling importance partner notification . Due possibility fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea infection , participant treat Ciprofloxacin inform high frequency Ciprofloxacin resistance study staff emphasize participant , participant particular , importance return study site receive result repeat testing/test cure . X . Confirmation Partner Notification : In order provide independent confirmation participant-reported notification status , study staff ask participant permission conduct third party partner notification confirmation report notification status . Participants ask permission contact recent partner ( ) telephone e-mail confirm notification outcome . Subjects inform obligated provide contact information partner . Subjects also inform provide contact information partner ( ) , study staff contact person use contact information provide notify person someone recently sex diagnosed STI , provide information local site offer free low cost test HIV STIs , answer question partner might .

A randomly select subgroup participant EPT Intervention Protocol invite participate individual interview partner notification process . Each participant ask participate two interview , one follow randomization one follow Follow-up Visit . Participants complete separate inform consent process individual interview receive additional compensation participation . XII . Eligibility . A randomly select subset participant EPT intervention protocol invite participate individual qualitative interview . Every fourth participant randomize invited participate individual interview reach project qualitative study sample 20 participant ( 10 intervention control arm ) .
