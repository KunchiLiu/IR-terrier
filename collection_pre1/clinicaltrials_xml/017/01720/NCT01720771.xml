	<detailed_description>Background In spite general decline dental caries , early childhood caries ( ECC ) still severe global problem social behavioural gradient [ 1 , 2 ] . The disease multi-factorial key event pH-induced stress oral environment result reduce diversity oral biofilm [ 3 ] . The biofilm simply adapt situation overgrowth caries-associated aciduric strain behalf beneficial health promote bacteria . Therefore , addition probiotic bacteria suggest novel approach maintain oral health adjunct exist evidence-based method [ 4 , 5 ] . Previous clinical trial indicate daily intake lactobacilli-derived dairy product reduce caries incidence , improve general health diminish use antibiotic preschool child [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] . However , study probiotic concept need ; child drink milk study childhood caries hitherto conduct non-dairy product streptococci strain . Objectives The aim present project evaluate effect daily administration chew tablet contain probiotic bacteria ( Probiora3 ) plaque amount , gingival health caries incidence preschool child . In addition , information general health collect . The null hypothesis oral health differ preschool child similar intake placebo tablet . An additional aim monitor microbial composition saliva sample baseline course intervention . Study design The study design prospective randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial two parallel arm . The duration 12 month . Assignment intervention control group make computer-based randomization group A B . Material The study group recruit among 2-year-old child regular patient attend Public Dental Clinic Rosengård , Malmö , Sweden . The clinic situate multicultural suburban area low socio-economy . The proportion immigrant high area , majority Arabic speaking . The inclusion criterion ) uncompromised general health , ii ) cavity severe dental disease , iii ) mentally physically disable . Children uncooperative totally reject dental examination exclude . The child consecutively enrol sign informed consent ( verbal write ) parent assign either test control group pre-numbered envelope generate computer program . As new patient enter study , clinician take next numbered envelope assign patient either group A B . The protocol subject regional ethical committee approve . Power calculation A power calculation clinical score alpha set 0.05 beta = 0.2 estimate 85 subject arm need disclose 30 % difference treatment group respect clinical score ( Fleiss Statistical Methods rate Proportions , 2nd edition , John Wiley Sons New York 1981 ) . Due expect relocation failure comply protocol , goal recruit minimum 220 maximum 250 child . Intervention duration All family receive comprehensive reinforcement oral health message dental hygienist prior baseline . The focus daily supervise brushing fluoride toothpaste . At baseline examination , plaque index , bleed brush caries score special form optical reading . Data ongoing medication etc extract dental record . In addition , caries risk assessment carry aid computerize program ( Cariogram ) accord Stecksén-Blicks et al . 2007 [ 8 ] . The parent child test-group ( group A ) instruct give child one EvoraKids® tablet daily , ideally brush , period 12 month . The parent child control-group ( group B ) receive instruction intake tablet without live probiotic bacteria . The group assignment unknown parent investigator disclose statistical calculation . The allocation concealment keep manufacturer . All parent encourage maintain habitual oral hygiene routine use fluoride toothpaste throughout study period . The test tablet contain Probiora3 trade mark three probiotic streptococci strain ( S. uberis KJ2 , S. oralis KJ3 S. rattus JH145 ) concentration 3x108 CFU . The tablet sweeten erythritrol tooth-friendly polyol ( nutrition fact , see Appendix B ) . The chew tablet ( test placebo ) , identical taste appearance , supply manufacturer ( Oragenics , USA ) package separate letter `` A '' `` B '' . The participate family provide tablet three month 's use time compliance check registered follow-up . Parents instructed report perceive side- adverse-effects immediately dental staff stop intake . Clinical examination Clinical examination perform baseline 6 12 month . The family contact every third month interview delivery study product . The examination score carry visually tactile two well-trained calibrate dental hygienist dental clinic . At baseline , information domestic oral hygiene routine , use baby bottle habitual sweet dietary intake collect 10-question questionnaire . The following endpoint score : Primary outcome measure : - visible plaque index ( VPI ) - prevalence gingival inflammation ( bleed brushing , BAB ) - prevalence caries ( cavitated lesion white spot lesion ) Secondary outcome measure : - number upper low respiratory infection - number otitis medium - number day diarrhea - doctor 's visit - prescription antibiotic - incidence allergy , asthma eczema Detailed methodology Visible plaque index ( VPI ) : Presence absence dental plaque along gingival margin upper incisor canine Bleeding brushing ( BAB ) : Presence/absence bleed gentle brush soft toothbrush Presence caries : Cavitated non-cavitated lesion register teeth accord criterion Public Dental Service express dmft dmfs The secondary endpoint score every sixth month telephone call parent base parental logbook . Clinical sampling In order monitor oral microbiota 2 study group course study , saliva sample collect baseline ( intervention ) 6 12 month follow-ups accord Barfod co-worker [ 9 ] . A cotton bud place parent mouth child supervision clinical staff . When soak , bud transfer small plastic tube , mark patient study number , immediately frozen store . After full completion trial , sample ship expense manufacturer Oragenics , FL , USA handle processing . The running cost clinical sampling cover separate agreement . Statistical method All data process IBM-SPSS software ( version 19.0 , Chicago IL , USA ) . The categorical data subject chi-square test . Continuous measurement calculate aid non-parametric test . The caries incidence calculate difference dmfs/dmft follow-up baseline . Comparisons carry study group baseline follow-up . The group concealment unveil statistical calculation . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Report result The null hypothesis either reject accepted . The finding without unnecessary delay report international congress submit publication appropriate peer-reviewed scientific journal . The supplier possibility read comment manuscript submission . Ethical consideration There side- adverse-effects foreseen connection intervention . All patient manage dentist specially trained dental hygienist accord `` best clinical practice '' project . A rapid development caries manage non-operative operative treatment irrespective group . All treatment carry without cost family . The tablet distribute free charge . All adverse event related treatment provide recorded adverse event form . The investigation perform accord principle Declaration Helsinki experimentation involve human subject .</detailed_description>
