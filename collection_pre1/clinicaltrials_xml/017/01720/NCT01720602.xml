	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer Receiving Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate rate clinical benefit ( objective response plus stable disease ) patient treat 28-day cycle vorinostat ( first 5 consecutive day week day 1-21 ) concurrent daily aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy ( 28 day ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability vorinostat AI combination therapy patient metastatic breast cancer . II . Assess change estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression , measure change F-18 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol ( FES ) standardize uptake value ( SUV ) use FES positron emission tomography ( PET ) complete per protocol 7184 two week vorinostat AI therapy 8 week therapy . III . Assess tumor metabolic response , measure change fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) SUV use FDG PET complete per protocol 7184 two week vorinostat AI therapy 8 week therapy . IV . Assess change hormone level ( estradiol , estrone , follicle-stimulating hormone [ FSH ] , sex binding globulin , testosterone , free testosterone ) 8 week therapy . V. Assess change ER , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , androgen receptor ( AR ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) tumor expression two week vorinostat AI therapy patient consent optional tissue biopsy procedure . VI . Assess time progression overall survival patient treat 28-day cycle vorinostat ( first 5 consecutive day week day 1-21 ) concurrent daily AI therapy ( 28 day ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) 5 day week 3 week . Patients also receive AI therapy comprise either anastrozole PO daily , letrozole PO daily , exemestane PO daily 4 week . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month progression , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
