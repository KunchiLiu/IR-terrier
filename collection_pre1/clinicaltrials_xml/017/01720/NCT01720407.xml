	<brief_summary>Lentigo malignant ( LM ) intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation occur photoexposed skin . In project , term applies Dubreuilh 's melanosis Dubreuilh 's intraepidermal melanoma . It consequently exclude invasive melanoma . Although surgery treatment choice , remain without consensus margin ( 5 mm 10 mm ) excision localize tumor face . Several study show imiquimod , activate local immunity interferon production , induce LM MLM regression could also decrease frequency relapse . The principal aim project study effect imiquimod versus vehicle pre-operative neoadjuvant treatment aim reduce surgical margin , first surgical procedure , frequency short medium term recurrence LM . Furthermore , improvement patient quality life could also significant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relevance Imiquimod Neo-adjuvant Treatment Reduce Excision Size Risk Intralesional Excision Lentigo Malignant Face</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint study demonstrate neoadjuvant treatment LM imiquimod prior surgery reduce frequency intralesional excision first surgical procedure , healthy tissue margin 5mm . Furthermore , improvement patient quality life could also significant . The number patient include study 268 . For patient , study involve several stage ( S ) , follow : S0 ( Selection ) : information obtain patient 's informed consent . Performance biopsy histological confirmation LM S1 ( S0 + ~ 2 week ) : patient inclusion follow anatomopathological confirmation LM . Patient randomisation one study arm : imiquimod versus placebo initiation topical treatment . S2 ( S1 + 4 week ) : Discontinuation imiquimod/placebo application . Scheduling surgical procedure 4 week later . S3 ( S2 + 4 week ) : Surgery . S4 : After last surgical procedure , simple clinical follow ensure every 6 month period 3 year , order study recurrence rate .</detailed_description>
