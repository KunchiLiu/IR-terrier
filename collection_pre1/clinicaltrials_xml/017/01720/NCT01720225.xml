	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare two different drug , decitabine azacitidine , give short standard dosing schedule help control MDS . The safety drug also study . Decitabine design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die . Azacitidine design block certain protein cancer cell whose job stop function tumor-fighting protein . By block `` bad '' protein , tumor-fighting gene may able work well . This could cause cancer cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Versus Azacitidine Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients With Low Intermediate-1 Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group : - If Group 1 , receive decitabine vein 1 hour . - If Group 2 , receive azacitidine either injection skin vein . If vein , infusion take hour . At first , equal chance assign either group . However , study go information become available , chance assign group show effectiveness increase . However , already enrol assign group , eligible change group . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . You receive study drug Days 1-3 every cycle receive least 2 cycle study drug . Study Visits : Every 7-14 day , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At end Cycle 2 , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate check status disease . This repeated every 2-4 cycle point disease appear respond study drug , often study doctor think necessary . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone and/or bone marrow withdrawn large needle . After Cycle 3 : If study doctor decide acceptable , may allow receive treatment local cancer doctor . However , return Houston least every 3 month study visit . The frequency visit depend doctor think best interest . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-Up Visits : One ( 1 ) time every 3 month last dose study drug , return clinic bone marrow aspiration check status disease . Other Information : You may give drug help prevent side effect . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . This investigational study . Decitabine Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available use patient MDS . Up 120 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
