	<brief_summary>Bortezomib establish treatment multiple myeloma; common practice UK administer bortezomib dexamethasone . This practice base data support improve response rate combination . Recent trial data indicate addition vorinostat bortezomib treatment overcome treatment resistance bortezomib . As current trial design investigate efficacy , safety tolerability combination treatment vorinostat , bortezomib dexamethasone patient relapse relapsed refractory myeloma . A comparison Phase II trial pivotal Phase III trial conduct MSD ( use label bortezomib indication without dexamethasone ) address impact dexamethasone regard tolerability additional efficacy myeloma patient .</brief_summary>
