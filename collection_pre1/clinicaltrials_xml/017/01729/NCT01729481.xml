	<brief_summary>In current study examine whether patient good risk factor ( age &lt; 75 year , total serum bilirubin &lt; 1,5xULN , history cardiovascular disease ) treat gemcitabine erlotinib develop skin rash grade first 4 week treatment comparable outcome patient receive FOLFIRINOX .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Plus Erlotinib RASH-positive Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study Burris et al . 1997 reveal superiority gemcitabine vs. 5-FU term improvement general condition , pain symptom overall survival patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . Subsequently , gemcitabine establish standard treatment locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . In series study gemcitabine combine chemotherapeutic agent targeted therapy . For first time , PA.03 study show significant improvement overall survival . Patients treat gemcitabine plus erlotinib survival 6.24 month , compare 5.91 month treat gemcitabine plus placebo ( HR 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.69-0.99 , p=0.038 ) . The one-year-survival rate 23 % gemcitabine plus erlotinib vs. 17 % gemcitabine plus placebo . In subgroup analysis PA.03 study , patient develop skin rash NCI CTC ≥ grade 2 advanced survival ( one-year-survival rate 43 % ) vs. grade 1 0 ( one-year-survival rate 16 % 9 % , respectively ) . Later study confirm correlation skin rash survival . While patient develop skin rash grade seem profit treatment erlotinib , prognosis without rash rather dismal . In population , survival vary 3.3 4.8 month clinical trial ( Verslype et al . 2009 , Boeck et al . 2010 , Manzano et al . 2010 ) . In patient , modification treatment strategy consider . Which kind treatment might lead optimal result patient yet clear . In patient excellent general condition comply prerequisits ( age &lt; 75 year , total serum bilirubin &lt; 1,5xULN , history cardiovascular disease ) French Prodige study-group could show statistical superiority gemcitabine-free FOLFIRINOX-scheme term overall survival , progression free survival response rate compare gemcitabine alone . However , superiority gain expense treatment tolerability . During treatment FOLFIRINOX grade 3-4 neutropenia observe 5.4 % grade 3-4 diarrhea 12.7 % patient ( Conroy et al . 2011 ) . For patient comply above-named criterion FOLFIRINOX consider establish standard care . If comparable efficacy gemcitabine plus erlotinib publish FOLFIRINOX data see select population , would favour , due bad tolerability FOLFIRINOX , use gemcitabine plus erlotinib . In summary , following selection conduct study : 1 . Selection due inclusion criterion treatment FOLFIRINOX provide Conroy et al . 2 . Selection due development skin rash within four week treatment 3 . No sign clinical tumour progression within run-in phase within first four week treatment Patients develope skin rash grade treat FOLFIRINOX . The efficacy FOLFIRINOX rash-negative patient yet investigate .</detailed_description>
