	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Overview : The measurement exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) clinical test measure airway inflammation perform consistently accurately clinical practice point-of-care . Airway inflammation recognize central mechanism pathogenesis asthma . The measurement FeNO NIOX MINO® device provide rapid , noninvasive , inexpensive tool ass airway inflammation inflammatory airway diseases asthma . The test easy perform require minimal training operator conduct test . Role Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) : FeNO evolve predictive prognostic biomarker airway inflammation . Nitric oxide ( NO ) gas produce epithelial cell bronchial wall intrinsic part inflammatory process . Measuring amount FeNO useful initial assessment patient chronic cough non-specific respiratory symptom suggestive asthma , management patient establish asthma receive corticosteroid treatment . Intended Use : NIOX MINO® measure Nitric Oxide ( NO ) human breath . Nitric Oxide frequently increase inflammatory process asthma . The fractional NO concentration expire breath ( FeNO ) measure NIOX MINO® assurance measurement repeatable accord guideline NO measurement establish American Thoracic Society . Rationale Study : None standard clinical assessment tool provide information regard underlie airway inflammation , control central effective asthma management strategy . Therefore study evaluate impact FeNO assessments asthma treatment decision approximately 40-50 subject 7-60 year age asthma . This pilot study also provide information regard ability physician correctly assess airway inflammation use standard clinical assessment tool ( i.e. , prior FeNO measurement ) . Finally , pilot study allow cost consequence change asthma management follow FeNO determination estimate . CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES The primary objective study evaluate impact FeNO assessments asthma treatment decision . The secondary objective study : - Evaluate ability physician correctly assess airway inflammation use standard clinical assessment tool ( i.e. , prior FeNO measurement ) . - Estimate cost consequence change asthma management follow FeNO determination . CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN This pilot , observational , single-center , single-visit , outpatient study . Approximately 30 50 subject participate study ( approximately ) 8 12 week study enrollment period . Eligible subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study invited participate . The following documentation information provide subject : - Informed consent - Demographics - Smoking history ( cigarette ) - Usual asthma standard care assessments - Asthma control test questionnaire - Spirometry - Study physician question FeNO : FeNO perform value review record . Subject discharge study : Once information collect procedure perform , subject discharge clinic study participation complete Medical device : The NIOX MINO® initially clear FDA March 4 , 2008 new hand-held device measurement exhale Nitric Oxide , marker eosinophilic airway inflammation . The recent clearance FDA September 2 , 2010 Instrument ( 09-1100 ) , use study . NIOX MINO® use child 7-17 year age adults 18 year age older initial assessment management asthma . The NIOX MINO® 10 second test base exhale breath measure 50 ml/second flow rate . Results provide point care within 2 minute successful completion breath test . The test influence patient effort variation clinician 's test technique . Definitions : Adverse event : Any incident use medical device ( include vitro diagnostics ) suspect resulted adverse outcome patient . Serious Injury mean injury illness : - Is life-threatening - Results permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure , - Necessitates medical surgical intervention preclude permanent impairment body function permanent damage body structure . Malfunction : failure device meet performance specification otherwise perform intend . Caused contribute : death serious injury may attribute medical device , medical device may factor death serious injury , include event occur result : - Failure - Malfunction - Improper inadequate design - Manufacture - Labeling - User error</detailed_description>
