	<brief_summary>Background : In early phase total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , patient experience multi-level weakness operate leg , cause primarily reduce central nervous system ( CNS ) activation failure muscle - especially knee extensor . This considerable loss muscle strength relate reduced functional performance . Early-commenced , progressive strength training knee extensor operate leg therefore seem rational . However , concern type early-commenced , intense physical rehabilitation exacerbate post-operative symptom , knee joint pain . The investigator recently report early-commenced physical rehabilitation , include progressive strength training knee extensor operate leg seem feasible TKA . The classic exercise-physiology literature emphasize load repetition perform contraction failure - among others - important variable muscle hypertrophy strength gain . It currently know load repetition perform contraction failure knee extension operate leg , influence post-operative knee joint pain patient TKA . Purpose hypothesis : The purpose study investigate loading repetition contraction failure influence knee joint pain knee extension operate leg early TKA . The hypothesis knee pain increase increase load fatigue . Methods : Fifteen patient unilateral TKA , operate 1 2 week prior first investigation , include . The participant investigate twice . During first investigation , absolute load ( kilogram ) correspond 10 Repetition Maximum ( RM ) ( load lift exactly 10 time ) determine unilateral ( operated leg ) knee extension . At second investigation , least 72 hour later , patient perform 1 set 4 repetition relative load 8 , 14 , 20 RM , randomize order , estimate 10 RM test first investigation . Time tension ( contraction velocity ) range knee joint motion repetition control . During concentric phase repetition , patient rate knee joint pain verbally , use numerical rating scale place 1 meter front . After short break , patient perform 1 set knee extension relative load 10 RM contraction failure . As load effect describe , rate knee joint pain concentric phase repetition .</brief_summary>
