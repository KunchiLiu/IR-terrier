	<brief_summary>Many hospital , include Ohio State University Medical Center , take picture blood vessel patient 's abdomen decide perform breast reconstruction use patient 's tissue . These picture call compute tomography ( CT ) angiograms like map patient 's anatomy . However , study report determined accurate picture show surgeon blood vessel locate . This study try determine picture miss blood vessel find surgery picture show correct location vessel</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Image-Guided Navigation During Breast Reconstruction Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze accuracy preoperative CT angiography determine location perforator vessel . Through use intraoperative navigation system , objectively locate perforators surgery compare result preoperative imaging assessment flap 's vascular anatomy . II . To determine whether preoperative CT angiogram allow microsurgeon correctly identify perforators ultimately use pedicle flap . OUTLINE : Patients undergo deep inferior epigastric perforator ( DIEP ) flap breast reconstruction use StealthStation navigation system . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1-2 week 1 month , every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
