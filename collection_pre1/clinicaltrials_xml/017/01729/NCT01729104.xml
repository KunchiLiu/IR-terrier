	<brief_summary>The goal Part 1 clinical research study find high tolerable dose carfilzomib give combination lenalidomide rituximab patient relapse refractory B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma . The goal Part 2 study learn drug combination help control B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma . The safety drug combination study part . Carfilzomib design keep cancer cell repair . If cancer cell repair , may cause die . Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may decrease growth cancer cell . Rituximab design attach cancer cell damage , may cause cancer cell die . It also design cause immune system attack cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 24 patient enrol Part 1 study 44 participant enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose carfilzomib receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level carfilzomib . Each new group receive high dose carfilzomib group , intolerable side effect see . Up 4 dose level study . If enrol Part 2 , receive carfilzomib high dose tolerate Part 1 . All participant receive dose level lenalidomide rituximab . Each cycle 28 day . Carfilzomib Administration : On Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 Cycles 1-12 : °You receive carfilzomib vein 30 minute . The first 2 dos receive may lower late dos . This reduce risk allergic reaction . On Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 Cycles 13 beyond : °You receive carfilzomib vein 30 minute . You drink least 6-8 cup ( 8 ounce ) fluid per day start 2 day first day treatment long doctor tell . During Cycles 1 2 , receive fluid vein dose carfilzomib . Before receive carfilzomib , give standard drug ( allopurinol , dexamethasone , antibiotic , anti-fungals , and/or anti-virals ) help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . During Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 , monitor side effect 1 hour receive study drug .

If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day . Do take double regular dose make miss dose . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide , seek emergency medical care need contact study staff right away . In order participate study must register follow requirement RevAssist® program Celgene Corporation . This program provide education counsel risk fetal exposure , blood clot reduce blood count . You require receive counseling every 28 day treatment lenalidomide , follow pregnancy test birth control requirement program appropriate take telephone survey regard compliance program . Rituximab Administration : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : °You receive rituximab vein . The first infusion take 6-8 hour . After , infusion take 4 hour . On Day 1 Cycles 3-12 : °You receive rituximab vein 4 hour . On Day 1 Cycle 13 every cycle ( 15 , 17 , 19 ) 24 month : °You receive rituximab vein 4 hour . For patient , may receive rituximab dose 2 day . Your doctor tell best approach . Your vital sign monitor , , infusion . You monitor side effect 1 hour receive rituximab . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask drug may take side effect . You give drug diary complete day record study drug take . You need bring study visit study nurse study doctor review . About 3-5 day Day 1 Cycles 1 2 , ECHO check heart function . On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration check status disease . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . If irregular menstrual cycle , also pregnancy test Day 15 cycle . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 , Day 15 Cycles 2 3 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . On Days 8 15 Cycles 1 2 , Day 15 Cycle 3 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Days 2 , 9 , 16 cycle : °Your vital sign measure . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , Cycle 12 , every 3 cycle : - If study doctor think need , CT scan , MRI , PET scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . - If study doctor think need , gastrointestinal endoscopy . About 3-5 day Day 1 Cycle 5 , every 3 cycle , ECHO check heart function . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : After finish taking study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurological exam . - You EKG check heart function . - Blood ( 3-5 tablespoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw thyroid function test . - You CT scan , MRI , and/or x-ray check status disease . - You PET/CT scan , check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration - If doctor think need , colonoscopy/gastrointestinal endoscopy . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . Long Term Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , call every 3 month 1 year every 6 month see find treatment receive since stop study treatment . These call take 2-3 minute . In addition phone call , medical record may review well . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Rituximab FDA approve treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma certain type leukemia . Carfilzomib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type MM . The combination drug investigational . Up 68 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
