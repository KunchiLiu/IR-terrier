	<brief_summary>The purpose study find high dose mebendazole ( MBZ ) safely give people malignant brain tumor combination current standard care ( temozolomide ) without cause severe side effect . We also want find MBZ slow growth brain tumor . The study doctor find MBZ effective malignant brain tumor laboratory animal model brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mebendazole Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma Patients Receiving Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma ( GBM ) common aggressive brain cancer , despite significant advance treatment majority patient die within two year diagnosis . During routine animal study serendipitously observe fenbendazole , benzimidazole antihelminthic use pinworm , prevent tumor engraftment . Subsequent vitro vivo experiment benzimidazoles identify mebendazole drug best result preclinical test 1 . In GBM cell line , mebendazole display cytotoxicity IC50s range 0.1-0.3 μM . Mebendazole disrupt microtubule formation GBM cell 's vitro activity correlate reduced tubulin polymerization . In two orthotopic mouse glioma model , one syngeneic one xenograft , mebendazole significantly extend average survival 63 % compare untreated control 1 . Mebendazole FDA approve antiparasitic agent well-established side effect safety record effective animal model dose schedule document safe human . Therefore , mebendazole possible anti-cancer therapeutic pre-clinical safety efficacy provide promising opportunity clinical trial patient malignant glioma . In addition , recently publish case report case report University Michigan document successful long term control metastatic adrenocortical adenocarcinoma use mebendazole 2 . Mebendazole well tolerate 200 mg/day use sole treatment patient fail chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
