	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Rituximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ipilimumab combination rituximab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary information effect add ipilimumab rituximab regard : immune response ; clinical anti-tumor response/overall remission rate ( ORR ) ( complete remission + partial remission ) ; progression free survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ipilimumab follow randomize study . PART I : INDUCTION : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute every 3 week 12 week rituximab IV 2-6 hour weekly 4 week . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute rituximab IV 2-6 hour every 12 week 1 year . PART II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive rituximab IV 2-6 hour weekly week 1-4 ipilimumab IV 90 minute weekly week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 . Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute rituximab IV 2-6 hour every 12 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive rituximab IV 2-6 hour weekly week 1-4 ipilimumab IV 90 minute weekly week 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute rituximab IV 2-6 hour every 12 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
