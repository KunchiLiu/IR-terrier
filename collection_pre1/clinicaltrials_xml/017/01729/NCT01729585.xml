	<brief_title>The Effects Massage Therapy QOL Youth/Young Adults With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Massage therapy ( MT ) define hand manipulation soft tissue body intent produce therapeutic , physiologic effect promote health well-being ( Oawriter - OAC - codes.ohio.gov , 2010 ; American Massage Therapy Association , 2010 ) . Quality life define self-description ( child adult ) parent 's description child 's perceived health well-being base satisfaction physical , emotional , psychosocial school/role functioning ( Varni et al. , 2002 ) . Additional measure study may influence QOL include pain , pulmonary function , ease breathe thoracic excursion . Research Questions : . What differences change QOL score , measure Peds QL 4.0 ( Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ) CFQ-R ( Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised ) find youth young adult CF group receive MT control group ? What change QOL score group find time ? ii . What differences change musculoskeletal pain , measure Numeric Rating Scale pain find youth young adult CF group receive MT control group ? What change pain score group find time ? iii . What differences change pulmonary function find youth young adult CF group receive MT control group term follow : 1 . Forced Expiratory Volume ( FEV1 ) Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) score , 2 . Single breath count score , measure ease breathing , 3 . Thoracic excursion measure cloth tape measure technique ? What change pulmonary function group find time ?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis CF evidence prior document positive sweat test ( &gt; 60 mEq/ml quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis genotype two identified mutation consistent CF ) Males female , age 8 21 year time enrollment obtain broad range symptom relate tissue change . ( Over time , individual CF present increase symptoms age disease progression . ) English speaking Pulmonary function clinical baseline &lt; 100 % ( Baseline define high PFT 6 month prior PFT enrollment . ) * This criterion eliminate expand eligible subject ( include PFT baseline &gt; 100 ) . Clinically stable define evidence acute upper low respiratory tract infection acute illness require use antibiotic least 14 day prior enrollment . ( Pulmonary exacerbation often include cough may affect response MT . ) * criterion omit study begin subject frequently treat antibiotic secondary CF pulmonary exacerbation . Approval participate Pulmonary Physician Informed consent participate Exposed investigational drug device within 30 day enrollment Any illness time enrollment direct result CF pulmonary physician determines MT contraindicate Inability lay flat massage table require massage protocol Platelet count within past 12 month &lt; 100,000 . ( Contraindication deep tissue MT . ) *eliminated criterion medical approval . INR International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ( blood test use monitor effectiveness blood thin drug ) within past 12 month &gt; 1.5 ( Delayed clot time contraindication deep tissue MT . ) * eliminate criterion medical approval . History hepatosplenomegaly deep tissue massage contraindicate . History lung and/or liver transplant deep tissue MT may contraindicate antirejection drug protocol . Received MT within past 30 day eliminate potential bias previous response treatment . *changed protocol allow enrollment wait 30 day initiate protocol . Skin condition injury would contraindicate MT would restrict ability apply massage stroke accord protocol</criteria>
