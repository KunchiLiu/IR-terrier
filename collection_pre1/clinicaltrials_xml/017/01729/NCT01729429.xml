	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial design evaluate whether behavioral intervention include three component : 1 ) reminder letter education material deliver clinic visit , 2 ) telephone recall visit originally decline vaccine , 3 ) telephone reminder miss 2nd and/or 3rd dos , increase 1 3 dose coverage human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine series among adolescent girl attend four Parkland primary care clinic Dallas county . Hypothesis 1 : Investigators expect high 1 dose HPV vaccine coverage among patient Intervention group General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group . Hypothesis 2 : Investigators expect significantly high 1 dose HPV vaccine coverage among patient Intervention group initially decline vaccine General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group initially decline . Hypothesis 3 : Investigators expect significantly high 3 dose HPV vaccine coverage among Intervention group General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary research goal implement evaluate evidence-based intervention strategy target adolescent girl parent stimulate patient demand human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine compliment provider-directed strategy already employ Parkland clinic . The project three specific aim : - Aim 1 . Determine mail packet invitation letter educational material ( HPV-specific general brochure recommend adolescent vaccine ) deliver prior clinic visit , increase 1 dose coverage HPV vaccine series . - Aim 2 . Determine telephone recall deliver 2 week clinic visit , increase 1 dose coverage among parent-patient dyad decline vaccine clinic visit . - Aim 3 . Determine telephone reminder overdue Dose 2 3 HPV vaccine series , increase 3 dose coverage series . Phase 1 - Cognitive interview : To ensure usability cultural appropriateness project material , investigator conduct 40 in-person , cognitive interview parent female patient age 11-18 attend Parkland clinic . Phase 2 - Randomized controlled trial . Investigators select invite 1200 family whose daughter upcoming appointment one four Parkland clinic site . Eligible patient randomize either Intervention group General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group . The Intervention group participant mail packet contain invitation letter join study HPV vaccine-specific educational material ; General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group participant mail packet educational material four recommend adolescent vaccine ( HPV , meningococcal , TDAP , influenza ) . A day packet send , research assistant call participant verify letter receive assess interest complete pre-clinic visit survey . Participants agree fill in-clinic survey ask come clinic appointment 40 minute early obtain verbal informed consent parent verbal assent adolescent female patient . Then , parent complete 20-30 minute survey HPV vaccine interaction daughter 's provider . The daughter complete short survey ask use social medium health concern . Intervention group participant complete in-clinic survey also eligible receive telephone recall reminder . If Intervention group parent refuse vaccine initial clinic visit , telephone recall deliver 2 week offer schedule immunization-only appointment . If Intervention group participant miss 2nd and/or 3rd dos , telephone reminder deliver . For participant complete in-clinic survey randomize General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group , parent refuse contact 2 week assess attitude intention toward HPV vaccine . Participants Intervention General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group medical record review assess HPV vaccine outcome , receipt three recommend adolescent vaccine , contact clinic 12 month follow randomization . Ancillary Analyses We perform stratified analysis multivariate logistic regression model examine whether certain subgroup likely initiate complete series ( e.g , vaccine uptake might vary characteristic preferred language , race/ethnicity , patient age , parent educational status ) . We use similar method also examine data confounding , example , initiation differs clinic site . If interaction find ( e.g. , outcome estimate similar different subgroup ) , report summary chi-square test adjust potential confounders . We also use date patient receive 1st , 2nd , 3rd HPV dos run time-to-recurrent event analysis . We model completion 3-dose series recurrent event data , 72 ; 73 event time intervention Dose 1 , Dose 1 2 , Dose 2 3 . A proportional mean model construct outcome recurrent event , variable interest include intervention group assignment , sociodemographic , clinic site , knowledge , attitude . A significant intervention indicator effect conclude intervention generally shortens time initiation receipt dos . Secondary Analyses We conduct follow secondary analysis evaluate whether parent receive intervention great HPV vaccine knowledge , information seek , PAPM stage progression compare parent receive usual care . Among consented additional contact complete pre-clinic follow-up survey , explore association among intervention assignment intermediate factor include parent ' HPV vaccine knowledge , attitude , perceive risk , information-seeking , HPV vaccine decisional stage . Descriptive statistic calculate outlier identify . A correlation matrix run check multicollinearity ( strong correlation intermediate factor ) . We run univariate multivariate logistic regression model determine whether intervention assignment associate great knowledge HPV vaccine , positive attitude toward information seek HPV vaccine , PAPM stage progression . To explore generalizability safety-net patient clinic , compute test chi-square test examine whether patient 1 ) decline participate 2 ) consent reminder recall intervention component differ randomized respect variable available EMR ( patient demographic , health care utilization pattern , clinic visit characteristic ) .</detailed_description>
