	<brief_summary>Transrectal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) minimally-invasive therapy prostate cancer currently assess two indication : first-line treatment ( either total focal ) patient eligible surgery salvage treatment local recurrence radiotherapy . It recently show Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound ( CEUS ) accurately assess position volume tissue destruction end prostate HIFU ablation . This provide live feedback regard amount residual non ablate tissue HIFU treatment , could allow immediate re-treatment case unsatisfactory result . CEUS require injection micro-bubbles sulphur hexafluoride ( Sonovue , Bracco , Milan , Italy ) , least theory , interfere HIFU treatment . Therefore , necessary wait 20 30 minute re-treating patient . Shear-wave ultrasound elastography ( SWUE , Supersonic Imagine , Aix-en-Provence , France ) quantify tissue stiffness . Moreover , post-HIFU necrosis know stiffer undestroyed prostate tissue . Therefore , SWUE could alternative CEUS , purpose study evaluate accuracy SWUE depict position volume therapeutic necrosis prostate cancer High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) ablation . The present study exploratory , monocentric , prospective , descriptive study . Three group 10 patient prostate cancer evaluate : patient refer first-line prostate HIFU ablation , patient refer first-line HIFU hemi-ablation ( focal treatment ) patient refer salvage HIFU radiotherapy . SWUE obtain day HIFU ablation ( D-1 ) , immediately HIFU ablation ( D0 ) follow day ( D+1 ) . CEUS perform immediately HIFU ablation D0 SWUE . The primary endpoint comparison thickness undestroyed parenchyma measure SWUE CEUS . The secondary endpoint : - The evolution shear elasticity within treated area measure SWUE D-1 , D0 D+1 , - Adverse event related SWUE . The study last 40 month .</brief_summary>
