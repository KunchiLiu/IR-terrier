	<detailed_description>The study single-center , double-blinded , randomize , 2-part , 2-arm , 4-sequence , crossover study incorporate acute chronic evaluation fruit polyphenols metabolic index marker oxidative stress . A planned sample size 30 overweight men woman recruit study . Subjects require meet several inclusion exclusion criterion , assess online clinic screening mechanism , include questionnaire , blood analysis , anthropometric measurement . Eligible subject invite participate study . Subjects begin complete 7-day pre-study assessment usual dietary intake use 3-day food diary follow washout dietary polyphenols . Subjects participate 4 , 6 h postprandial study day : 2 precede chronic intervention 2 8 week active ( fruit polyphenols ) placebo beverage . Subjects randomize first day start acute chronic study phase . Subjects ask limit polyphenolic contain food beverages 3 day prior 6 h postprandial study visit well chronic dietary intervention . Subjects provide standardized dinner meal pack day 6 h postprandial visit . For 6 h postprandial study visit , subject arrive fast follow procedure publish lab previously . This include : pre-study evaluation compliance ( fast , dinner consumption , limited polyphenol intake ) readiness study visit , catheter placement register nurse , fast blood sample , consumption high fat/carbohydrate meal accompany 1 two treatment beverage ( active/fruit polyphenol placebo beverage ) , subsequent blood sample catheter [ ~1 tablespoon ( 12ml ) ] designate time point 6 hour . Each postprandial study visit day last approximately 7 hour subject require remain Clinical Nutrition Research Center Illinois Institute Technology main campus duration visit . The visit procedure repeat twice ~ 1 week apart accommodate subject testing beverage . After complete acute 6 h postprandial study visit , subject roll chronic phase study receive 2nd randomization sequence consume active placebo beverage daily 8 week . Before cross alternative treatment beverage another 8 week , subject 4-week break ( wash ) . Subjects counsel low polyphenolic diet throughout study consume assign beverage twice per day lunch even meal ( except 4-week washout ) . At end week 8 treatment period , subject come research center 6 h postprandial study visit day : procedure identical postprandial study test visit exception placebo beverage consume breakfast .</detailed_description>
