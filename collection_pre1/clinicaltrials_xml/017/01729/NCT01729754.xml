	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety/Tolerability Subcutaneous Tildrakizumab ( SCH 900222/MK-3222 ) Participants With Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis Followed Long-term Extension Study ( MK-3222-011 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The base study consist screen phase 4 week follow treatment period 52 week , 20-week follow-up period . The base study treatment period divide 3 sequential part . In Part 1 base study ( Week 0 Week 12 ) , participant randomize one 4 study arm ( Arm A : tildrakizumab 200 mg + match placebo etanercept ; Arm B : tildrakizumab 100 mg + match placebo etanercept ; Arm C : matching placebo tildrakizumab + match placebo etanercept ; Arm D : matching placebo tildrakizumab + etanercept 50 mg ) . In Part 2 base study ( Week 12 Week 28 ) , participant Arm A Arm B receive match placebo tildrakizumab maintain blind Week 12 receive either tildrakizumab 200 mg ( Arm A ) tildrakizumab 100 mg ( Arm B ) Week 16 . Participants Arm A Arm B also receive match placebo etanercept weekly study Week 28 . At study Week 12 , Arm C participant re-randomized receive first dose tildrakizumab 200 mg tildrakizumab 100 mg , receive additional dos study medication accord re-randomized treatment assignment Week 16 . Participants Arm C also receive match placebo etanercept treatment Week 28 . Participants Arm D continue weekly dos etanercept study Week 28 combination match placebo tildrakizumab . In Part 3 base study ( Week 28 Week 52 ) , participant Arm A &gt; = Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index 75 % ( PASI-75 ) response Week 28 re-randomized either continue tildrakizumab 200 mg receive tildrakizumab 100 mg study Weeks 28 , 40 , 52 . Participants &gt; = PASI-50 response &lt; PASI-75 response continue receive tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 week participant &lt; PASI-50 response discontinue study . Participants Arm B &gt; = PASI-75 response Week 28 continue receive tildrakizumab 100 mg every 12 week . Those &gt; = PASI-50 response &lt; PASI-75 response re-randomized receive continue tildrakizumab 100 mg tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 week . Participants Arm B &lt; PASI-50 response discontinue study . Participants Arm C continue receive treatment every 12 week accord re-randomized treatment assignment . Participants Arm D achieve &gt; = PASI-75 response Week 28 discontinue study . Those participant &lt; PASI-75 response Week 28 cross tildrakizumab 200 mg receive dos Weeks 32 , 36 48 . Eligible participant choose enroll extension study additional treatment period 192 week monitor additional 20 week follow-up period . Each participant receive tildrakizumab 200 mg tildrakizumab 100 mg every 12 week study Week 244 accord treatment assignment conclusion Part 3 base study .</detailed_description>
