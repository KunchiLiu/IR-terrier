	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) , define partial response ( PR ) good time induction therapy . The success therapy determine ORR strong consideration give secondary endpoint tolerability , duration response , quality life ( QOL ) . All patient treat experimental regimen . Several novel feature explore : substitution cyclophosphamide melphalan ; weekly AND subcutaneous bortezomib instead standard twice weekly , intravenous dosing ; alternate bortezomib lenalidomide maintenance . The investigator hypothesize regimen prove tolerable effective induce maintain remission patient population historically difficult treat , namely Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) patient elderly suffer comorbidities , renal insufficiency , otherwise complicate aggressive therapy like autologous stem-cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . In short , investigator view `` Multiple Myeloma trial non-trial candidate . ''</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Velcade + Cyclophosphamide Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 35 patient accrue single arm , open label , phase II trial period 18 month , study induction chemotherapy VELCADE , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone administer attenuate dose schedule accommodate non-candidates high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation - often frail patient population . Maintenance therapy follow alternate lenalidomide VELCADE . All patient receive antiviral ( zoster ) prophylaxis , peptic ulcer prophylaxis recommend . Aspirin and/or anticoagulation leave study physician discretion . All patient treat experimental regimen . Several novel feature explore : substitution cyclophosphamide melphalan ; weekly AND subcutaneous bortezomib instead standard twice weekly , intravenous dosing ; alternate bortezomib lenalidomide maintenance . The overarch aim preserve efficacy minimize toxicity inconvenience often frail patient population .</detailed_description>
