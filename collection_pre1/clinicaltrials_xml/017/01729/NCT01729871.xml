	<brief_title>A Study Exploring Two Treatment Strategies Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Who Undergo Catheter Ablation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( participant assign intervention group chance ) , open-label ( physicians participant know identity assign treatment ) , active-controlled , multi-center safety study rivaroxaban VKA catheter ablation procedure . This study require collaboration medical institution provide access electrophysiologists normally perform catheter ablation procedure . In study , NVAF define presence AF person prosthetic heart valve ( annuloplasty without prosthetic ring , commissurotomy and/or valvuloplasty permit ) hemodynamically significant mitral valve stenosis . Approximately 250 eligible participant , age 18 year old , history paroxysmal , persistent , long stand persistent NVAF schedule undergo elective catheter ablation procedure randomize 1:1 ratio receive either rivaroxaban 20 mg orally , once-daily , administer preferably even meal VKA ( adjust achieve recommend International Normalized Ratio 2.0 3.0 ) . The study consist screening period , pre-procedure period , procedure period post-procedure period . The screening period begin 2 week prior randomization . Participants randomize begin pre-procedure period . During period , participant recommend receive assign treatment least 4 week ( maximum 5 week ) catheter ablation procedure . For participant sufficient anticoagulation , document 3 week prior randomization , participant transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) intracardiac echocardiography ( ICE ) , length pre-procedure period may reduce 1-7 day must include transition previous anticoagulation therapy randomize study drug . After catheter ablation procedure , participant receive post-procedure dose study drug minimum 30 + - 5 day . In addition schedule visit telephone call study may also include additional phone call visit participant site dose adjustment require usual care .</detailed_description>
