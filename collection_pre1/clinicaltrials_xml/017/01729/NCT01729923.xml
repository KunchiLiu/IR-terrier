	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well capecitabine celecoxib without radiation therapy work treat patient colorectal cancer newly diagnose previously treat fluorouracil , spread part body ( metastatic ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving capecitabine celecoxib together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Maintenance ADAPT Therapy With Capecitabine Celecoxib Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate complete response 2 year follow initiation first line 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) base chemotherapy patient initially unresected metastatic colorectal cancer treat activate cancer stem cell ( CSCs ) dormancy prim subsequent targeting ( ADAPT ) protocol . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival , relapse free survival ( complete response [ CR ] ) base intent treat ( ITT ) analysis . II . To determine quality life ADAPT therapy . III . To determine effect v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( K-ras ) mutation status , resection radiation response ADAPT therapy . OUTLINE : Patients proceed surgery , radiation therapy ADAPT therapy follow maintenance ADAPT therapy , ADAPT therapy . Eligible patient undergo surgical resection baseline upon achievement resectable disease radiation therapy . RADIATION + ADAPT : Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 day per week receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) celecoxib PO BID 5 day per week radiation . ADAPT : Patients receive capecitabine PO BID day 1-14 celecoxib PO BID day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day 3 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
