	<brief_summary>The purpose research study identify reason cause all-ceramic bridge fracture include thickness bridge material , type bridge material bite force person . This all-ceramic bridge compare metal-ceramic bridge . The investigator conduct study make bridge withstand force mouth tend break . The overall objective research analyze property ceramic material different force mouth interact affect longevity bridge . These include fracture toughness , elastic modulus ceramic layer support substrate , core thickness , connector height , wear , load orientation , maximum clench force .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Survival Implant-Supported All-Ceramic Prostheses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-range goal propose research formulate design survival statistic aid dental community fabricate properly design prosthesis predictably survive oral environment . Patients qualify study randomize ( chance flip coin ) two group . The first group metal-ceramic group patient receive bridge metal substructure underneath . The second group all-ceramic group patient receive bridge make hard ceramic material . All patient receive two dental implant bond bone period 4-6 month . An impression mold implant make bridge fabricate base randomization patient . Patients ask return 6 month yearly thereafter 5 year . During recall appointment , photograph take impression bridge teeth make . This allow u measure amount wear happen bridge teeth . The investigator also examine amount bone around implant well integrity bridge .</detailed_description>
