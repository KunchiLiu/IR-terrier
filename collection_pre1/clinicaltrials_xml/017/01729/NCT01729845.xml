	<brief_title>Decitabine Followed Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride , Etoposide , Cytarabine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) decitabine prim follow sequential mitoxantrone hydrochloride/etoposide/cytarabine ( MEC ) chemotherapy adult relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine , within limit Phase 1/2 study , disease response duration remission . II . Identify biomarkers ( e.g. , deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] methylation and/or gene expression change ) associate treatment response . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study decitabine follow phase II study . Patients receive decitabine intravenously ( IV ) day -9 -5 ( dose level 1 ) , day -11 -5 ( dose level 2 ) , day -14 -5 ( dose level 3 ) . INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV day 1-5 , etoposide IV day 1-5 , cytarabine IV day 1-5 . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) CR incomplete platelet count recovery ( CRp ) may receive 2 course induction therapy 2 course consolidation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
