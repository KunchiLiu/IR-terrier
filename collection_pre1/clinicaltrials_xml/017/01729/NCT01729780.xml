	<detailed_description>The accepted definition mentally traumatic event event chance death , severe injury severe threat one 's body ( either victim observer ) event stimulate intense emotional response fear , horror helplessness1 . About forty percent western population undergo event life time , thirty percent suffer short live anxiety disorder quarter suffer chronic anxiety disorder ( PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ) depression2,3 . The distinction different anxiety disorder base time appearance long last . The short disorder acute stress reaction ( ASR ) appear immediately traumatic event disappear 48 - 72 hour . ASR symptom include dissociation , anxiety affective instubility3 . The medium range anxiety disorder acute stress disorder ( ASD ) , appear first two week follow event last month . Its symptom include dissociation , re-experiencing traumatic event avoidant behavior place action might resemble traumatic event . The long lasting disorder post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , last month include symptom re-experiencing , avoidant behavior hyper arousal1 . A recent meta analysis study prevalence PTSD patient suffer acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) demonstrate 12 % develop PTSD ( study prevalence 32 % ) . In three study include , morbidity mortality stem PTSD examine twice high compare patient without PTSD4 . The personal , social financial toll anxiety disorder significant still , date , except treatment aim prevent occurrence disorder . A study subject show early intervention ( do day week traumatic event ) advantage prevention PTSD , oppose immediate intervention ( show benefit ) 5,6 . Due subjectivity experience traumatic event great difficulty prediction develop anxiety disorder . A risk factor development PTSD suggest different study : female sex , minor , low socioeconomic status , young age , history trauma , mental illness , little social support , severity event adrenergic hyperactivity follow event5 . The brain area report involved PTSD Amygdala prefrontal cortex7 . Still , observation enough construct predictive model allow diagnosis / treatment . A prospective study , do lab , demonstrate hyperactivity Amygdala alongside change hypocampal plasticity decrease activity ventromedial prefrontal cortex comparison baseline subject suffer PTSD , show high level anxiety without formal diagnosis anxiety disorder8 . Pharmacological intervention trauma event show poor specificity benefit . In contrast , behavioral \ psychological intervention cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) trauma orient show benefit6 . Alas , due nature re-experiencing reliving traumatic event patient reluctant partake . A new kind intervention , become popular past year , change brain wave pattern use Neurofeedback ( EEG-NF ) . By use closed circuit brain computer interface ( BCI ) , patient receives feedback ( ) brain activity via external marker link mental status . The feedback allow patient modulation brain activity designate area practice aim . The practice last session , patient apply technique without immediate feedback10,11 . Early study EEG-NF focus alpha wave ( 8 - 12 Hz ) due link feeling calm12,13 . Later , method broaden due finding show state sleepiness main frequency brain activity low theta wave ( 4-7 Hz ) 14 . The method A/T NF since use research treatment ADD/ADHD15 show useful alleviation symptom PTSD two studies16,17 . In recent study EEG-NF effective reduce level anxiety patient acute coronary event18 . First appointment - Subjects ask join hospitalization cardiac intensive care unit first 72 hour coronary event . In meet subject ask sign inform consent form interview one study team member ask answer psychological questioner . Also , perform rest EEG , try relax special guidance . The meeting last hour . Some subject ask undergo MRI brain scan hospitalization . In first part scan subject ask remain still moment try relax ( special guidance ) . After watch series picture movie clip emotional valence . During final part scan subject ask remain still moment . This meeting , perform , also last hour . First follow meeting ( do face face phone ) : A month follow coronary event team member contact subject ask second appointment , questioner redo order ass anxiety depression level , include appearance post traumatic symptom . The purpose meeting identify subject high risk develop PTSD . The meeting last hour . After second meeting sixty patient , exhibit post traumatic symptom , ask continue study . The rest exclude . Those continue undergo 12 additional meeting : An initial meeting start EEG-NF training , patient fill questioner undergo rest EEG guidance . After undergo MRI scan rest exposure stimulus . This meeting last hour half two hour . Next , subject divide two group . The first undergo ten EEG-NF training meeting second undergo ten shame EEG-NF meeting . The meeting do time frame two month guide study 's team member . The EEG-NF training alpha/theta EEG , specify earlier . Each subject connect EEG device continuously register / ' brainwave activity . The alpha/theta ratio compute online translate subject sound . A decrease ration , implicate relaxation , lead decrease sound ' volume . The subject ask continue soften sound relaxing . Each meeting last twenty minute . The shame group connect EEG device , hear sound ask relax order soften sound . The sound ' volume depend alpha/theta ratio change randomly . Each meeting last twenty minute . Final meeting : two four week follow completion ten EEG-NF meeting ( true shame ) , subject ask final meeting undergo clinical evaluation second MRI brain scan . They fill questioner earlier . This meeting last hour half two hour .</detailed_description>
