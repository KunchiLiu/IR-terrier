	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety administration effect valproic acid clusterin expression cognitively-intact , healthy , elderly subject . Clusterin mutation recently identify risk factor development Alzheimer 's Disease change clusterin expression see elderly develop Alzheimer 's disease irrespective whether carry genetic mutation . Valproic acid may prevent reverse change . Fourteen subject normal memory think participate study . Ten subject receive valproic acid 4 receive `` placebo '' capsule active medicine . Participants take study medication placebo 28 day follow total 35 day trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This placebo-controlled , single-center , multiple ascend dose study . Seven healthy volunteer enrol 2 sequential cohort , total 14 enrolled subject . The study conduct use two dos valproate ( 250 mg PO bid , follow 500 mg PO bid ) . At dose level , 7 cognitively intact normal elderly subject enter study two subject randomly select receive placebo five subject receive designate dose valproate . Study procedure include routine assessment adverse event , safety lab , baseline MRI , physical neurological exam , cerebrospinal fluid collection .
