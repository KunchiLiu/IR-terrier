	<brief_summary>The study design explore compare efficacy safety etomidate propofol without analgesic painless gastroscopy , provide reliant support implementation promotion comfort care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etomidate Emulsion Sedation Patients Scheduled Upper Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To widely implement painless gastroscopy require diagnose treatment gastroscopy due large number significant suffering patient . Also , development exploration anesthesiology bound prompt development exploration painless gastroscopy . However , anesthesia risk painless gastroscopy usually high general anesthesia perform operating room due condition , monitoring equipment well staff implementation . Thus , find safe convenient approach general anesthesia profound impact full promotion implementation comfortable care . Etomidate , main advantage little effect circulatory respiratory system , feature rapid onset metabolism , may helpful guarantee safety painless diagnosis treatment , thus appropriate procedure short duration anesthesia . However , controversy regard whether analgesic use combination , well give combine regimen .</detailed_description>
