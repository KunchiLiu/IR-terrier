	<detailed_description>Screening colonoscopy removal pre-cancerous adenoma recently show result 53 % reduction mortality colon cancer . While clearly validates practice screen colonoscopy , miss adenomas , especially proximal colon , define include cecum , ascend colon , transverse colon , remain concern . This demonstrate study 183 patient underwent back-to-back colonoscopy . In population overall miss rate adenoma 24 % proximal adenoma miss often ( 27 % ) leave colon adenoma ( 21 % ) . Another study look 4192 patient SEER ( Surveillance , Epidemiology , End Results ) Medicare database develop `` interval cancer '' , colon cancer patient colonoscopy do previous 6-36 month . These interval cancer predominantly proximal colon ( Proximal 68 % , Distal 19.5 % , rectum 10.4 % , unspecified 2.1 % ) . This also suggest pre-cancerous lesion miss proximal colon . As method increase proximal adenoma detection rate would welcome change . One emerge technique show promise improve adenoma detection rate water colonoscopy . In one early study employ water method trend towards high ADR water method group recognize ( 37 % vs. 26 % ) . The observation prompt retrospective analysis 1178 case screen surveillance colonoscopy perform single endoscopist Sacramento VAMC , show overall ADR ( presence least one adenoma ) 27 % air colonoscopy whereas water method colonoscopy 35 % ( p=0.007 ) . In subsequent combine analysis two prospective RCT air vs. water colonoscopy screen surveillance use schedule unsedated colonoscopy [ 5 ] on-demand sedation [ 6 ] , patient find least one diminutive adenoma proximal colon water method group air group ( 28 % vs. 14 % , respectively , p=0.0298 ) . Another quasi randomize study screen patient perform Phoenix VAMC use high definition equipment confirm significantly high overall ADR water method ( n=177 ) compare air method ( n=191 ) ( 57 % vs. 46 % ) ( p=0.03 ) . The odds detect adenoma 81 % high water method ( OR 1.81 ; 95 % CI : 1.12-2.90 ) independent age , body mass index ( BMI ) , current smoking alcohol use , withdrawal time &amp; quality bowel preparation . In proximal colon ADR significantly high patient examined water method air method ( 46 % vs. 35 % ) ( p=0.03 ) , particularly adenomas &lt; 10 mm size ( 38 % vs. 25 % ) ( p=007 ) . These encouraging preliminary data reflect potential benefit water method colonoscopy . Our current research question whether benefit see community base population oppose VA population mostly male Caucasian . The investigator plan perform prospective , randomize control trial compare proximal adenoma detection rate water exchange colonoscopy group air colonoscopy group . The investigator intend employ schedule sedation , instead on-demand sedation , continue current protocol place institution . Patients study arm undergo split bowel preparation colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
