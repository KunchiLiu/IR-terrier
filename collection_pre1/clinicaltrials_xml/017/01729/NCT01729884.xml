	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantify characterize human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -specific central memory T cell ( TCM ) effector memory T cell ( TEM ) subsets peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) patient vaccinate HER2 cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) peptide-based vaccine . II . To evaluate feasibility expand HER2-specific effector T cell ( TE ) derive HER2-specific TCM TEM precursor patient vaccinate HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine characterize function . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety administer HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine patient receive trastuzumab and/or lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally ( ID ) monthly 3 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
