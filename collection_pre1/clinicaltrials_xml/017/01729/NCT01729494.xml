	<brief_summary>The study purpose determine safety efficacy belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen ( calcineurin inhibitor free ) alemtuzumab rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction early glucocorticoid withdrawal ( CSWD ) belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen tacrolimus-based regimen rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction early glucocorticoid withdrawal renal transplant recipient . The hypothesis belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen alemtuzumab induction , MMF/MPA , early glucocorticoid withdrawal ( Group A ) renal transplant recipients Belatacept-based immunosuppressive regimen rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction , MMF/MPA early glucocorticoid withdrawal ( Group B ) lead less risk graft loss , patient death , reduce renal function 12 month compare tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen rabbit antithymocyte globulin , MMF/MPA , early glucocorticoid withdrawal renal transplant recipient ( Group C ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal transplant effective treatment end-stage renal disease . It provide improved survival quality life . Maintenance function renal transplant mandate lifelong immunosuppressive therapy prevent immune destruction graft . Current immunosuppressive regimen yield 1-year survival rate 89 % cadaveric 94 % living-donor graft . Over time , however , progressive loss subject graft . Five-year graft survival cadaveric living relate donor renal transplant 67 % 80 % , respectively . The common cause long-term subject graft loss kidney transplant recipient cardiovascular disease chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) , respectively . Paradoxically , principal immunosuppressive therapy renal transplant , calcineurin inhibitor ( CNIs ) , cyclosporine ( CsA ) tacrolimus , directly contribute long-term allograft loss subject death , since inherently nephrotoxic cause exacerbate cardiovascular risk include hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus . There , therefore , substantial unmet medical need new therapy renal transplant provide short-term subject graft survival comparable CNIs without long-term nephrotoxic , cardiovascular , metabolic effect . Because belatacept administered time engraftment rather delayed fashion , frequently necessary CNIs - especially allografts initial impaired renal function -- affords immunosuppression timely manner . Unlike CNIs , target mechanism action belatacept provide immunosuppression without nephrotoxicity adverse effect cardiovascular/metabolic profile . Glucocorticoids cornerstone immunosuppressive therapy six decade . Although glucocorticoid provide potent suppression allo-immune response human , adverse effect include infection , diabetes , weight gain , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , bone disease , dermal thinning , collagen loss multiple tissue , cataract , combine lack available therapeutic monitoring argue continue use transplantation . Belatacept represent potential new treatment option renal transplant recipient , address current unmet need immunosuppressive treatment provide short-term outcome comparable calcineurin inhibitor ( CNIs ) potential avoid renal , cardiovascular , metabolic toxicity . However , initial Phase 3 study exhibit high rate acute rejection malignancy . The malignancy associate recipient EBV negative time transplant . All EBV negative patient preclude treatment Belatacept . Due limitation Phase 3 trial design require use basilixumab induction , intuitive addition potent cell deplete induction agent may decrease overall acute rejection rate patient treat belatacept . The current study test assumption follow immunosuppressive regimen . Group A B consist potent T-cell deplete induction agent combine belatacept . Group C represent common immunosuppressive regimen currently utilize United States . Each regimen include early withdrawal glucocorticoid along maintenance mycophenolate mofetil . Based upon totality available evidence , current study offer favorable benefit/risk profile study subject , potential continue provide important data development new immunosuppressive regimen address important unmet need . The proposed Phase 4 study design determine whether belatacept , combination immunosuppressive agent ( rabbit antithymocyte globulin alemtuzumab , mycophenolate mofetil/EC mycophenolate sodium ) , may provide acceptable efficacy safety de novo kidney transplant recipient , regimen provide simultaneous CNI freedom early CSWD .</detailed_description>
