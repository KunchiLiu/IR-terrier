	<brief_summary>Clinical measure adipose tissue mass ( BMI , waist circumference , waist-to-hip ratio ) adequately explain inter-individual ethnic heterogeneity diabetes . . There need identify novel/universal marker risk diabetes ( DM ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . These biomarkers also become additional outcome measure intervention pancreatic/kidney transplant . If biological marker show improvement intervention anthropometric change occur , intermediate outcome encourage find practitioner . This study focus central question `` adipose tissue dysfunction '' mediator metabolic complication positive energy balance , independent body fat content distribution . This study address question effect hyperglycemia adipose tissue function independent body fat mass . This project take advantage unique expertise investigator perform detailed metabolic study patient diabetes undergo pancreatic/kidney transplant . The result propose study provide support novel approach identify adipose tissue dysfunction , rather obesity fat distribution , predictor diabetes CVD across ethnic group , age gender . We obtain necessary preliminary data future grant submission support central hypothesis develop strong interaction within outside The University Texas Medical Branch ( UTMB ) clinical investigator area DM complication .</brief_summary>
