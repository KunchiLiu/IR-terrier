	<brief_summary>Despite advance treatment conventional cardiovascular risk factor , patient kidney disease remain high risk fatal cardiac event . To date , kidney disease affect approximately 2 million Canadians ; however , patient population remain grossly understudied due complex nature disease . The inadequacy literature address cardiovascular-related mortality rate kidney disease reflect urgent need investigation novel risk factor . One cardiovascular risk factor recently validate clinical measurement cardiac autonomic tone ( CAT ) . CAT refers amount activity contribute stimulatory inhibitory limb cardiac autonomic nervous system , work concert one another control heart rate . CAT quantify computer analysis heart rate time , capture simple Holter electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recording . Abnormal CAT , occur autonomic system control heart rate properly response physical demand stress , associate risk adverse cardiovascular event healthy high risk population . It recently show patient severe kidney disease demonstrate significant CAT abnormality , thus exaggerated susceptibility cardiac death . Vitamin D ( VD ) deficiency also common patient population due fact kidney play crucial role VD metabolism . Given VD deficiency establish cardiovascular risk factor , possible kidney disease patient experience compound risk due combination VD deficiency abnormal CAT . However , study ever investigate whether VD deficiency influence CAT healthy diseased population . To knowledge , first trial ever examine effect , , different VD supplementation treatment ( standard care vs. combination ) CAT population burden overwhelming risk incidence cardiovascular sudden cardiac death risk .</brief_summary>
