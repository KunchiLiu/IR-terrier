	<brief_summary>The remarkable improvement survival child congenital disease lead continuously grow number adult congenital heart disease develop world . Many patient cardiac surgery early age , may live many year pressure overload , volume overload , systolic diastolic dysfunction , cyanosis combination . These past ongoing cardiac insult often result significant cardiac remodeling . A biomarker fibrosis remodeling may enormous clinical prognostic value patient . Serum biomarkers integrate many field medicine . In cardiology , number biomarkers use . In last decade , group focus natriuretic peptide marker heart disease infant child . This result many study 25 publication medical literature . We believe newly discover cardiac marker , ST2 , emerge important addition cardiac evaluation come years.The aim study measure ST2 level patient congenital right heart disease correlate ST2 level clinical status , image prognosis .</brief_summary>
