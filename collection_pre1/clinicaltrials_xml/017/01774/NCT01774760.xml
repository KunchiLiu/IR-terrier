	<detailed_description>All patient undergo normal diagnostic staging procedure , include conventional 18F-FDG PET/CT scan purpose RT surgical planning . In addition , 18F-EF5 PET/CT scan perform separate day . The patient receive intravenous injection 250-350 MBq [ 18F ] EF5 . After , venous blood sample obtain measurement plasma radioactivity . A low-dose CT ( helical ) perform attenuation correction anatomical reference . After , PET scan perform ( start 3 h injection ) . The second 18F-EF5 scan perform similar way 4-7 day first scan . A representative histologic sample primary tumor pre-condition study effort make store part fresh histologic material liquid nitrogen later use immunohistochemical analysis . Patients schedule undergo preoperative definitive chemoradiotherapy use current clinical standard completion current protocol . Follow-up information ( event-free survival overall survival ) gather .</detailed_description>
