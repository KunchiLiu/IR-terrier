	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine proportion subject sufficient improvement ventricular function undergo standardize Left Ventricular Assist Device ( LVAD ) plus pharmacologic recovery treatment test protocol allow removal LVAD within 18 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remission From Stage D Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The encouraging result LVAD base recovery series suggest significant hemodynamic unloading provide Mechanical Circulatory Support ( MCS ) conjunction aggressive pharmacological treatment may induce profound reverse structural remodel turn result curative alternative specific patient population severe heart failure . The active identification characterization patient high potential full cardiac function recovery paramount importance . The development standard simplify recovery protocol would ultimately lead large bridge recovery patient population . The primary objective study determine proportion subject sufficient improvement ventricular function ( remission heart failure ) undergo standardize LVAD plus pharmacologic recovery treatment test protocol allow removal LVAD within 18 month . The secondary objective study twofold , first determine durability sustain remission HF follow LVAD explantation 12 month 3 year second determine predictor recovery .</detailed_description>

Subject nonischemic etiology ( confirm angiography either within 2 year implantation prior explantation ) 6 . Subject undergone HM II implantation within prior 4 week plan HM II implant 7 . Subject history HF &lt; 5 year . 1 . Subject evidence active acute myocarditis confirm histology 2 . Subject history previous CVA result significant fix motor deficit limit ability perform exercise test 3 . Subject implanted mechanical aortic and/or mitral valve ( ) 4 . Subject aortic valve closure 5 . Subject diagnose hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy sarcoidosis 6 . Subject LVEDD normal confirm surface echocardiogram ( restrictive cardiomyopathy ) 7 . Subject irreversible multiorgan failure 8 . Pregnant lactate woman unwilling utilize two reliable method birth control woman childbearing age 9 . Subject diagnose psychiatric disease , irreversible cognitive dysfunction poor psychosocial issue likely impair compliance study protocol 10 .
