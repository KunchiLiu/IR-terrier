	<brief_summary>It non-randomized , multicentric , cohort study , combine biological sample collection , retrospective clinical data collection genetic immunologic biomarkers study . The ProfiLER program aim implement personalized cancer medicine approach propose establish genetic immunologic profile tumor patient advance malignant tumor , order define map genetic ( pre-identified target gene ) immunologic profile study type cancer . This study also allow adapt therapeutic management patient , need , give target therapy immunotherapy ( commercialize ongoing clinical trial ) , base recommendation multidisciplinary molecular board . The genetic immunologic profile tumor determine archival fresh collect ( biopsy reachable lesion ) tumor sample blood sample . The correlation genetic profile tumor , patient immunity status retrospective clinical data ( progression , tumor response , etc . ) collect patient medical record probably allow u identify biomarkers potential predictive value determine genetic disorder link immunity status alteration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Program Establish Genetic Immunologic Profile Patient 's Tumor All Types Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determination tumor profile review multidisciplinary molecular board : The genetic immunologic profile perform available tumor sample blood sample . Genetic profile : - Research mutations/insertions/deletions array predefined gene tumor deoxyribonucleic acid high-throughput sequence - Analysis copy number variation gene tumor deoxyribonucleic acid microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization - Analysis rearrangement involve gene Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ca n't detect Next Generation Sequencing array Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( balanced translocation ) mean fluorescent hybridization probe tumor sample Immunologic profile : analysis expression relevant immunologic marker Retrospective clinical data collection : Patients ' clinical data collect retrospectively patient medical record . This study treatment evaluation . Patients ' follow-up treatment perform accord center local practice specificity clinical trial patient would enrol , depend recommendation give multidisciplinary molecular board , review tumor genetic profile .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance ( locallyadvanced metastatic ) malignant tumor histological type Tumor sample available determine genetic profile : either archival tumor sample [ FFPE ( formalin fix paraffin embed ) ] perform new biopsy accessible lesion ( left investigator 's appreciation ) . Please note brain bone lesion consider accessible lesion . Patient must cover medical insurance . Informed consent sign patient and/or parent ( legal representative ) patient 18 . No tumor sample available .</criteria>
