	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Study Progressive Relapsed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remain leading cause cancer death men woman United States . Despite advance treatment advance NSCLC last decade , survival outcome remain poor . Treatment benefit cytotoxic chemotherapy reach plateau progress depend upon identify novel method target tumor cell . Harnessing human immune system target lung cancer could result development effective treatment option lung cancer potentially enhance effect cytotoxic chemotherapy . Lung cancer cell produce number abnormal protein abnormal amount certain protein find normal lung cell . In cancer , abnormal protein expression may lead immune response cancer cell much way immune system respond infection . In progressive lung cancer however , immune system fail identify respond abnormality cancer cell attack destroyed reason yet fully understood . This clinical trial proposes novel method stimulate immune system recognize abnormal component find lung cancer cell stimulate immune response destroys block growth cancer . This new method treatment help immune system lung cancer patient `` identify '' target cancerous tissue . As example , patient receive organ transplant replace damage kidney heart treat special drug supress immune response destroy `` reject '' transplant organ . This `` rejection '' occur patient 's immune system respond difference cell transplant organ immune system attack foreign tissue way would attack infected tissue . When difference foreign tissues patient 's body even large , perhaps like difference organ pig immune system cell human , rejection rapid , highly destructive immunity generate long-lasting . This call hyperacute rejection medicine use immunize patient protocol try harness response teach patient 's immune system fight lung cancer body would learn reject transplant organ animal . To , place mouse gene culture human lung cancer cell line . These cell express sugar stimulate strong immune response human . These cancer cell irradiate prevent growth inject along chemotherapy patient lung cancer . The presence sugar stimulate patient 's immune system kill inject immunotherapy cell . As part process destroy immunotherapy cell , patient 's immune system stimulate identify many difference cancer cell normal human cell . This extra stimulation think encourage immune response lung cancer patient base share abnormality lung cancer immunotherapy cell patient 's lung cancer cell . In experimental therapy , patient give docetaxel injection immunotherapy consist three type modify lung cancer cell . We propose test treatment patient lung cancer progress initial chemotherapy demonstrate treatment immunotherapy result improve tumor stabilization response could potentially improve patient 's overall survival .</detailed_description>
