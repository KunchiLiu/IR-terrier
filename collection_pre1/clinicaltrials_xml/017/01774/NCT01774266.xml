	<brief_title>Detection Methylated Reprimo Plasma Asymptomatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer first cause death Chile second worldwide . Currently , screen method available early detection gastric cancer population level . The available test serum level pepsinogen I/II gastric atrophy , precursor lesion intestinal type low risk progress gastric cancer . The investigator ' previous work , support FONDECYT ( National Council Research Technology ) FONIS ( National Council Research Development Human Health ) Government Chile lead u discover potential biomarker early detection gastric cancer , Reprimo , tumor suppressor gene relate p53 arrest G2-M cell cycle ( Clin Cancer Res . 2008 ; 14:6264-9 ) . Here , investigator propose evaluate plasmatic detection Reprimo conjunction gastric atrophy marker H.pylori detection establish novel screening triage strategy early detection gastric cancer . The aim ) determine sensitivity specificity Reprimo detection gastric cancer high-risk population evaluate upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ( 1,000 male , 30-74 y.o . low income , symptomatic asymptomatic ) ii ) characterize clinical , pathological molecular level case gastric cancer identify non-identified direct detection Reprimo along atrophy , H.pylori clinical marker . With information , investigator develop algorithm screening triage evaluate predictive value plasmatic detection Reprimo versus atrophy &amp; H.pylori detection clinical data general population ( 3,000 male/female , 40-70 y.o . ) high-risk area gastric cancer Chile . In step investigator evaluate also acceptability , efficacy efficiency propose algorithm . In proposal investigator aim develop commercial kit use primary screen non-invasive triage early detection gastric cancer . This kit cost-effective accessible general population . In addition , investigator would like expand investigator ' current patent already submit INAPI propose royalty biomedical diagnostic company use investigator ' product international level .</detailed_description>
