	<brief_summary>Anaplastic thyroid cancer historically proven difficult research due combination rarity associate short survival period affect . In 2009 , 2340 patient UK diagnose thyroid cancer 70-90 expect anaplastic subtype 1,2 . For patient average life expectancy range 2-6 month small number survive one year . It highly aggressive form cancer refractory current treatment option . By collect tissue blood sample along clinical data across UK able accumulate numerically significant number sample data point facilitate research opportunity . Researchers encourage apply access collect sample order try establish causal mechanisms disease development , potential therapeutic target relate clinical course outcome specific molecular defect . Due rarity feasible single cancer centre cancer network accumulate sufficient sample research meaningful timeframe hence need national collaboration order try offer patient disease hope future . All UK patient anaplastic thyroid cancer would potentially eligible . The project expect run least 5 year thyroid cancer clinician encourage participate . Patients ask donate surplus thyroid cancer tissue follow routine biopsy procedure along optional blood sample . 2 . Objectives Primary Objectives The primary objective project establish national anaplastic thyroid cancer tissue collection help facilitate basic translational research opportunity . There direct research question project address stage . The research proposal subsequently arise result project generate accredited research party UK potentially internationally . These research proposal submit National Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank Database Project ( NATT ) Steering Committee assessment . As volume material collect per patient expect small volume , virtue specimen comprise core biopsy fine needle aspirate material , research proposal need prioritise accord potential benefit propose research offer . Priority give project may lead identification potential therapeutic target . Each research proposal require ethical approval research development assessment commence . The steer committee multidisciplinary include nationally respect researcher thyroid cancer clinician . Scientific Justification The long term objective try address current lack understanding aetiology progression disease ultimately develop new therapeutic intervention may slow rate disease progression , improve quality life prolong currently short survival . Due short prognosis follow diagnosis notoriously difficult run interventional therapeutic clinical trial patient population . Patients usually present locally advanced metastatic disease consequence often poor performance status make clinical trial participation problematic . If potential therapeutic target could identify vivo would potentially open new therapeutic avenue whilst spar patient 'wrong ' molecular profile futile treatment . This unique project within set anaplastic thyroid cancer research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design methodology ATC patient identify thyroid cancer specialist ( include endocrine surgeon , head neck cancer surgeon , clinical oncologist , endocrinologist , pathologist , radiologist , clinical nurse specialist ) work thyroid cancer multidisciplinary team ( MDTs ) across UK Cancer Networks . Patients approached member MDT provide patient information leaflet National Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank Database project . Following discussion adequate time consider project , patient invite participate provide write consent . Consent seek thyroid tissue collection , blood sample collection well collection anonymised clinical data . It expect majority patient willing participate care unchanged potential help future patient difficult situation . As entry study affect patient 's care time limit diagnosis participation undertaken . As majority patient anaplastic thyroid cancer amenable total thyroidectomy tissue specimen collection usually entail diagnostic core biopsy fine needle aspirate thyroid gland . The tissue specimens initially used histological diagnosis local hospital spare tissue subsequently send Wales Cancer Bank ( WCB ) 3 . In minority patient undergo form thyroid resection , tissue block possibly slide send storage WCB initial diagnostic work complete . An optional EDTA blood sample also collect sent WCB . Patients ideally provide tissue blood sample opt submit one specimen type prefer . A multidisciplinary steering committee establish oversee run project review subsequent independently submit research proposal . A baseline Case Report Form ( CRF ) complete forwarded WCB . Where consent give collection clinical data enter either patient 's thyroid consultant Dr Moss secure confidential Thyroid Cancer Forum-UK4 database . As ATC comprise heterogeneous group histological appearance often prove difficult accurately diagnose , central pathological review process implemented ensure uniform pathological reporting . An opportunity molecular profile individual tumour also consider stage . Outcome data request 6 , 12 , 18months annually thereafter . However prognosis generally poor current treatment option , outcome data collection unlikely extend beyond 6 month majority case . ATC disease trajectory , response treatment outcome ( Progression Free Survival Overall Survival ) correlate histological appearance molecular profile . Patient identifiable data accessible refer centre clinical team care patient National ATC Tissue Bank . Each patient allocate unique identification number WCB store data specimen use reference . It unknown currently available UK data thyroid cancer incidence precisely many case anaplastic thyroid arise annually . It estimate 70-90 new case diagnose per year . The research project expect run 5 10 year first instance allow significant number patient include project . Funding secured Thyroid Cancer Support Group- Wales5 . Eligibility Criteria - All patient anaplastic thyroid cancer able provide inform consent . - Patients foci anaplastic thyroid cancer within differentiate thyroid cancer able provide inform consent . Exclusion Criteria - Patients non anaplastic thyroid cancer include medullary thyroid cancer , papillary thyroid cancer , follicular thyroid cancer , thyroid lymphoma - Patients unable provide inform consent Identification Patients Patients may discuss identify thyroid cancer head neck cancer multidisciplinary team meeting . Identification may arise pathologist , radiologist , clinicians clinical nurse specialist . Due expect short survival patient group would prospective identification patient retrospective review previous case . Patients approached member team either inpatient ward patient clinic diagnosis confirm , patient aware diagnosis sufficient time come term diagnosis . Patient Recruitment Registration Patients confirm diagnosis anaplastic thyroid cancer aware diagnosis able provide inform consent would consider . Appropriate patient would receive verbal explanation study first instance follow write information leaflet . The patient would give much time need decide wish participate . For wish proceed , member thyroid cancer multidisciplinary team go consent process consent form . They answer question highlight optional part study . The patient would give copy consent form include contact detail local thyroid cancer team lead Chief Investigator . No patient vulnerable group would approach . Information tissue bank database project post Thyroid Cancer Forum-UK ( TCF-UK ) Thyroid Cancer Support Group- Wales websites well announce national international thyroid cancer meeting medical press . Other UK thyroid cancer patient support group keep informed project contact anaplastic thyroid cancer patient family . The project also register displayed www.clinicaltrials.gov website . Sample Collection Storage It expect vast majority patient already biopsy Fine Needle Aspirates ( FNA ) take thyroid gland order make diagnosis case sample send tissue bank . Occasionally diagnostic biopsy retrieve anatomical site thyroid gland include , confine , cervical lymph node distant metastasis . Only tissue sample longer required local pathology department send tissue bank . Due usual short prognosis patient disease expect local pathology department need request sample back order undertake investigation later date patient 's cancer journey . However situation arise unused sample return request . The patient ask wish donate optional EDTA blood sample part research project sample take possible time routine clinically indicate blood sample reduce number venepuncture procedure require . Data Collection Storage The patient ask wish summary clinical history include detail mode presentation , treatment intervention complication ( require tracheostomy enteral feed tube ) include study . Thyroid Cancer Forum-UK already establish national anaplastic thyroid cancer database . This hosted secure website server register Information Commissioner 's Office . The data accessible Dr Laura Moss , project Chief Investigator TCF-UK data controller , individual patient 's consultant . This system already run anaplastic thyroid cancer patient ( medullary thyroid cancer patient ) concern raise either patient clinician perspective . Quality Assurance The patient 's local thyroid cancer team responsible liaise NATT project/Wales Cancer Bank attribute unique identifier number study participant . The patient ' initial unique identifier number use identify subject . The Wales Cancer Bank ( WCB ) process confidential valuable data . The WCB Security Policy aim protect data loss destruction , unauthorised access modification . It also ensure data integrity maintain . The clinical data Thyroid Cancer Forum-UK database store secure website server . The national data accessible Dr Laura Moss ( NATT Chief Investigator TCF-UK data controller ) . The patient 's local team access data patient patient register elsewhere UK . Data field collect include patient initial , NATT unique identifier number , gender date birth . This information require order nationally assess age gender distribution correlate treatment receive outcomes . Ethical consideration Research anaplastic thyroid cancer thwart combination rarity poor prognosis . A rare disease often quote incidence &lt; 2 case per 100,000 anaplastic thyroid cancer incidence 0.17 per 100,000 Europe . The rarity mean difficult carry prospective research without collaboration amongst thyroid cancer team . This project design involve thyroid cancer multidisciplinary team across UK seek approach many patient anaplastic thyroid cancer possible . The project discuss early stage National Cancer Research Institute Thyroid Cancer subgroup support . Patient involvement project development seek early stage two UK thyroid cancer specific patient organisation , Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust Thyroid Cancer Support Group-Wales . The latter charity subsequently commit funding entire project . It anticipate recruitment rate high patient need undergo additional invasive procedure blood test optional . Patients aware rare disease currently effective therapy short prognosis anticipate altruistic donation benefit future patient face diagnosis . Patients approach member local thyroid cancer multidisciplinary team experience management disease appropriate experience consent procedure . The database aspect project new concept . Thyroid Cancer Forum-UK , collect data field manner several year patient across UK . The database project register Information Commissioner 's Office . Data collect accordance Caldicott Principles patient identifiable data limit . Patients participate project face physical risk result participation project . Due anticipate timescale collection tissue data expect take minimum several year meaningful outcomes achieve . The poor prognosis disease mean project participant unlikely alive subsequent research project come fruition therefore benefit directly participation study . The patient information leaflet explain project objective term ask individual patient term donation tissue , blood data also stipulate sample store pending submission future research proposal respect researcher necessary ethical approval scrutinise National Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank Database ( NATT ) steer committee . Patients able withdraw consent stage , without need provide reason make aware unused sample either return local hospital dispose accordance Human Tissue Authority code practice data remove database . The issue consent withdrawal expect significant problem . Human tissue disposal It recognise donation NATT project altruistic patient free withdraw consent without reason time . Patients advise , time consent , sample may already used time wish withdraw . It acknowledge disposal human tissue sensitive area project comply Human Tissue Authority code practice , 'The removal , storage disposal human organs tissue ' Ethics Approval The project conduct accordance World Medical Association , Declaration Helsinki ( 2008 version ) accordance term condition ethical approval give trial . Study management Velindre NHS Trust Research Development Department responsible organise Material Transfer Agreements Velindre NHS Trust Tissue Collection Centre . Individual investigator liaise local R &amp; D department . They responsible recruit patient , adhere recent version protocol collection data case report form ( CRFs ) . The project overseen multidisciplinary steer committee comprise clinical oncologist , Wales Cancer Bank manager , Velindre NHS Trust R &amp; D management , thyroid cancer scientist pathologist . The committee review tissue sample collection term central pathology review ensure consistency , rate national recruitment , number centre participate potential limitation patient recruitment project . Publication Any publication presentation arise directly result project acknowledge contribute investigator . Summary The aim project facilitate research opportunity difficult disease historically difficult research due combination rarity overall poor prognosis . By utilise national tissue data resource model significant number patient sample study realistic research timeframe . The project potential help understand disease aetiology open new avenue treatment intervention . As result patient participate project agree surplus anaplastic thyroid cancer tissue plus blood sample send Wales Cancer Bank storage suitable research project approve National Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank Database ( NATT ) Project Steering Committee . Participants also option clinical information collect pre-existing national database . Participants approach regard tissue blood sample .</detailed_description>
