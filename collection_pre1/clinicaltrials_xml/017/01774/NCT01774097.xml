	<brief_title>Patients With Intermittent Claudication Injected With ALDH Bright Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral Artery Disease ( PAD ) occur artery arm leg ( often legs ) become narrowed plaque . Because plaque , patient PAD also increase risk heart attack stroke . Those PAD often intermittent claudication ( blockage blood vessel leg ) . This blockage decrease blood flow leg muscle , cause pain one leg exercise ( walk ) . Intermittent mean pain come go . Because PAD interfere circulation , worsen condition increase pain leg ; sometimes even period rest . Bone marrow contain special stem cell may promote blood vessel growth , prevent cell death , transform number tissue include new muscle . There small subpopulation bone marrow mononuclear cell , call aldehyde dehydrogenase-bright ( ALDHbr ) cell , highly enriched type stem cell . The enzyme ALDHbr cell respond damage signal may play important role tissue repair . In study investigate safety efficacy bone marrow derive stem cell particular characteristic PAD patient intermittent claudication explore new end-points evaluate therapeutic effect use novel MRI imaging modality well traditional endpoint .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease classic claudication ( exerciseinduced pain , cramp , fatigue , equivalent discomfort involve large muscle group leg ( ) consistently relieve rest ) atypical leg pain ( exertional leg pain begin rest resolve consistently rest ) define San Diego Claudication Questionnaire . 2 . Age ≥40 year 3 . Resting anklebrachial index &lt; 0.90 rest toebrachial index &lt; 0.70 baseline test 4 . Presence significant stenosis occlusion infrainguinal artery include superficial femoral artery , popliteal artery and/or infrapopliteal artery determine : Duplex ultrasound image ( occlusion focal double peak systolic velocity one affected segment ) OR low extremity compute Tomography Angiography ( CTA ) OR low extremity magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) OR low extremity catheterbased contrast arteriography . Each noninvasive invasive anatomic assessment identify patient least 50 % stenosis affect segment . 1 . Presence musculoskeletal disease , cardiac pulmonary disease , neurological disease limit patient 's ability walk fulfill protocol requirement ( claudication must consistent primary exercise limitation ) 2 . Inability complete treadmill test per protocol requirement . 3 . Ability walk 12 minute treadmill treadmill test . 4 . Patients identify legs equivocally symptomatic alternate symptomatic leg baseline treadmill test . 5 . Patients critical limb ischemia ( ischemic rest pain ischemiarelated non heal wound tissue loss ( Rutherford categories 46 ) . 6 . Recent ( &lt; 3 month ) infrainguinal revascularization ( surgery endovascular revascularization ) revascularization plan study period 7 . Patients patent infrainguinal bypass graft index limb , without evidence hemodynamically significant stenosis defect ( kink , pseudoaneurysm , fistula ) . Patients occlude infrainguinal bypass graft patent aortobifemoral femoralfemoral bypass graft NOT exclude . 8 . Patients &gt; 2+ low extremity pit edema 9 . Patients myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) 10 . Patients pregnant lactating , plan become pregnant next 12 month , unwilling use acceptable form birth control study participation . 11 .

Planned change ( initiate terminate ) active involvement supervise exercise program ( e.g. , trainer , exercise protocol , goal , peripheral arterial disease , cardiac pulmonary rehabilitation program ) study participation 20 . Plans change medical therapy duration study , ( i.e . patient use cilostazol remain stable dose four week prior enrollment change dose 6 month study duration . ) As always , cilostazol discontinue new heart failure intolerance occur study participation . 21 . Any condition require immunosuppressant medication ( e.g. , treatment organ transplant , psoriasis , Crohn 's disease , alopecia areata ) . 22 .
