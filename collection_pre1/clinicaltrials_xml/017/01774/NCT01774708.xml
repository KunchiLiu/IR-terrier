	<brief_summary>Presence/absence bed along heartbeat , respiration , gross motion bed measured 48 Budd Terrace resident , long-term care facility Emory Healthcare . Measurement do use pressure-sensitive mat lie underneath mattress never touch patient . PHI information collect Emory staff . This PHI restrict : age time participation ; medical condition ; medication . The PHI store lock file behind locked door . Data management provide unique identifier participant link name keep separately aggregate data . The data collect bed sensor process offline separately PHI proof concept evaluation use machine learn technology predict bed exit 1 5 minute ahead time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Falls fall-related injury lead cause injury death among old adult . This proposal help prevent fall night develop new alarm system . Current bed-exit alarm system sound patient half way bed ground . We need warn patient try exit bed . The investigator believe patient ' heart rate breathing change leave bed . They may also start move within bed . This brief study nursing home patient participant . Our primary outcome interest bed-exits , 10 participant time monitor average 6 week ( less anticipate stay ) time 250 bed exit record . Nearly participant physical and/or mental impairment high risk fall . The investigator use investigational device watch patient use pad mattress . This monitor call `` Early-Sense 5 '' . The system work like microphone low sound . It change heart , lung , movement vibration tiny electrical signal . A wire carry signal control box . The information collect box store check later . We use five different math description recognize pattern . One may useful give 1 - 5 minute early warning patient exit bed . The plan determine whether pattern difference three area ( heart rate , breathe rate , body movement ) recognize depend warn u bed-exits attempt bed-exits . There four study target . The first develop five possible mathematical description . The second use rest information test description meaningful ability predict patient get bed . The third show warn time one five minute . The fourth test best mathematical description false alarm true fall prevention . How doable Phase I depend well predict patient get bed . If identify pattern easily , Phase II research put forward . This study support National Institute Aging ( SBIR-I ) .</detailed_description>
