	<brief_title>EUS-guided Fine Needle Biopsy With New Core Histology Needle Versus Conventional Fine Needle Aspiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) well-established tool diagnosis stag many gastrointestinal condition , include limited , malignant pre-malignant neoplasm pancreas , esophagus , rectum , submucosal tumor develop along gastrointestinal tract . EUS provide endoscopic video image within lumen gastrointestinal tract combine ultrasound image via transducer position tip endoscope . This diagnostic ability enhance biopsy method call fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) . FNA via EUS ( EUS-FNA ) enable small needle pass lesion interest ultrasound guidance , obtain cellular material cytology analysis . EUS-FNA currently recommend confirmation locally advance pancreas adenocarcinoma , diagnosis pancreatic cystic neoplasm neuroendocrine tumor well autoimmune pancreatitis , characterization submucosal tumor GI tract , determination malignant lymph node status stag various cancer . While EUS-FNA impressive technical success rate 90-95 % , diagnostic accuracy less robust mass lesion , particular pancreatic mass , sensitivity specificity 75 % 100 % respectively , translate negative predictive value 72 % . And set chronic pancreatitis , condition major risk factor development cancer focal , non-malignant nodule often develop may mimic tumor , sensitivity EUS-FNA may 54-74 % . The diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA particular importance pancreas adenocarcinoma pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor 5-year survival rate 5 % 32 % respectively . Thus , crucial patient find focal mass lesion reliable test effectively exclude malignancy . Currently , EUS-FNA necessary negative predictive value order sensitivity test low . This mean positive result FNA confirm malignancy negative result unable exclude confidence . This conundrum tend leave patient unfortunate position often return multiple investigation perform repeat EUS-FNA clinical suspicion mass lesion remain high cytology result think falsely negative . In order overcome current limitation EUS-FNA cytology , new EchoTip® ProCore™ fine needle biopsy ( FNB ) needle develop order obtain core tissue sample histology cytology . This important histology expect increase diagnostic yield EUS-guided biopsy compare cytology . In addition , certain clinical circumstance desirable sometimes necessary obtain core tissue biopsy histology rather cellular material cytology obtain EUS-FNA . In addition assessment mass lesion pancreas , several clinical area acquisition core tissue sample histology may prove superior cytology conventional EUS-FNA . For instance , EUS part standard-of-care stag esophageal cancer histology may improve sensitivity EUS-biopsies determination lymph node metastasis . Also , although EUS prefer method work-up submucosal lesion gastrointestinal tract , value EUS-FNA differentiate various subtypes lesion often limit , typically FNA provide insufficient cellular material reliably . Finally , clear cytology EUS-FNA inadequate diagnosis autoimmune pancreatitis core biopsy sample histology need . We expect new EchoTip® ProCore™ FNB needle potentially prove superior FNA area . Study Objectives The purpose study determine new EchoTip® ProCore™ needle ( FNB histology ) superior current standard EchoTip® Ultra™ needle ( FNA cytology ) diagnosis focal , solid lesion biopsy sample EUS clinically indicate . In particular , objective compare sample adequacy FNB FNA solid mass lesion within pancreas , submucosal lesion gastrointestinal tract malignant status lymph node part esophageal cancer stag . The sample adequacy determine accord ability pathologist provide definitive diagnostic interpretation base sample provide . Study Design This prospective , comparative trial examine use new EchoTip® ProCore™ FNB needle exist EchoTip® Ultra™ FNA needle stratify lesion type ( solid pancreas lesion , intra-abdominal mass , submucosal tumor , suspect metastatic lymph node ) . Both FNB FNA needle use lesion randomization needle type first pas , alternate subsequent pass ; thus lesion serve internal control . Methods Consecutive patient refer EUS assessment solid lesion require FNA approach regard study enrollment . Only patient EUS-FNA clinically necessary select . Consenting patient undergo standard EUS examination indicate base lesion subtype , differ EUS exam would receive choose participate . Participating patient lesion visualize EUS technically amenable FNA lesion biopsied FNB FNA needle . The choice needle size ( 19g 22g ) leave clinical discretion endoscopist . However , needle size must use FNB FNA needle . Patients randomize type needle use first pas lesion , subsequent pass alternate needle type . For EchoTip® ProCore™ FNB needle , good sample obtain ( assessed endoscopist perform EUS examination ) first pas , pass make . If sample obtain first pas consider likely insufficient tissue acquire , second pas perform . Regardless obtain second needle pas , additional pass make use FNB . The core tissue obtain FNB needle place formalin sent histology analysis . For conventional EchoTip® Ultra™ FNA needle , minimum 2 pass perform . In case cytotechnologist present , feedback give endoscopist 2nd pas . In case cytotechnologist present , 4 separate pass make , few endoscopist satisfy sample obtain . The sample obtain FNA needle place slide also cytology medium ( accord standard clinical protocol ) . The histology cytology specimens sent pathology department site interpretation sample do usual fashion per standard clinical care . The pathologist first describe biopsy specimen term `` adequacy sample pathologist interpretation '' - i.e . ability pathologist provide definitive diagnostic interpretation base sample provide . Next , pathologist provide diagnostic interpretation .</detailed_description>
