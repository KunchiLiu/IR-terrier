	<detailed_description>General description - Aim study Due development intensive care number survive premature infant increase significantly.Delayed emergence sleep-wake-cycling newborn first sign brain injury . Clearly define sleep-states identify 32 week gestation onwards . Few study show , extremely premature infant ( &lt; 26 week gestation ) may already show early sleep-states . In project aim study emergence sleep-wake-cycling extremely premature infant , prospectively collect electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data . Premature infant &lt; 29 week gestation include measure 3 hour period every second week conventional amplitude-integrated EEG . New analytical method ( automatic neonatal EEG algorithm ) use compare conventional visual analysis . In international interdisciplinary cooperation physician , electrophysiologist mathematician able deduct conclusion provide important prognostic information patient , parent physician . State art scientific challenge Increasingly data show , delay emergence sleep-wake cycling newborn first sign brain injury associate later adverse neurodevelopmental outcome . Due increase survival rate among premature population prevention later neurological deficit currently become even important . Rates cerebral palsy ouvert cerebral lesion ( cystic periventricular leukomalacia peri/intraventricular haemorrhage ) decreasing , incidence neurodevelopmental impairment remain high preterm infant . This explain understanding different mechanism brain injury ( example inflammation , oxidative stress , impaired connectivity ) result mainly cognitive impairment ( 1 ) . Therefore great attention need direct toward preterm neonatal population well understand brain adaptation without medical complication . Neurophysiologic surveillance necessary infant adequately asses cerebral function difficult within population clinical aspect . Conventional EEG today´s gold standard neurophysiologic diagnosis . Nevertheless suitable continuous record since produce large data volume assess directly bedside . In effort solve problem , various method reduce compress EEG signal develop , amplitude-integrated EEG ( aEEG ) , one . Emergence sleep-wake-cycling The concept state early brain ontogenesis preterm infant controversial . It generally accept pattern represent sleep preterm infant highly variable less organize pattern describe full-term infant . Well organized sleep state appear 31 week gestation well establish 36 week postconceptional age . However several researcher question assumption base study sleep preterm infant ( 4-7 ) . They support rudimentary state differentation might present early 26 week gestation . In study 2001 observe cyclical variation EEG background activity resemble early sleep-wake cycle early 24/25 week gestation ( 2 ) . Neurophysiological method - amplitude-integrated EEG For early identification infant high risk optimize treatment , mandatory access reliable validate diagnostic method excellent predictive value later neurodevelopmental outcome . The aEEG readily available , informative reliable technique continuous non-invasive monitoring brain activity even extremely premature infant . Our research group ten year experience use amplitude-integrated EEG simple method continuous bedside monitor neonatal intensive care unit set . Our group recently show aEEG predictive value later outcome preterm infant therefore use early prognostic tool neurodevelopmental outcome ( 3 ) . We find emerge sleep-wake cycle early 24-25 week gestation neurologically healthy premature infant . On contrary premature infant intraventricular haemorrhage exhibit significant delay emergence sleep-wake cycle , average 32 week gestation ( 8 ) . We know early age development intercellular connection brain synaptic branching still development process take place mainly sleep . Neurophysiological method - conventional EEG Conventional visual classification EEG signal different brain region standard analysis since 1960s first neonatal recording perform . Today 80 % extremely premature infant 24-28 week gestation survive . Within analysis EEG signal grow need reliable automatic method , suitable specific population . New nomenclature emerge specifically premature population spontaneous activity transient ( SATs ) , constitute salient feature EEG preterm period ( 9-11 ) .These spontaneous burst activity , related excitatory role GABAergic transmission early development characterize premature EEG , link development intracortical connection neuronal wiring . SATs constitute slow activity ( 0,1-0,5 Hz ) , nest activity several high frequency . This activity represent organization development thalamo-cortical connection , neuron migrate subplate cortical plate primary sensory cortex . The cooperation finnish expert field within study , experience automate EEG algorithm analysis allow even analysis emergence early sleep-wake-cycling allows conventional , visual analysis EEG . As far know would first study evaluate detail emergence sleep-wake-cycles preterm infant use different method first study , try identify role SATs development sleep organization extremely premature infant . Research questions/ Objectives/ Hypotheses We plan conduct prospective single-center cohort trial international cooperation order analyze emergence sleep-wake rhythm premature infant detail use conventional video-EEG amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring . First objective study detail description early sleep state , analyze cortical region deep structure responsible involved development describe sequence emergence study EEG feature prospective `` healthy '' cohort drug bias pathology . ( Infants show neurological disease use neurologically active medication analysis ) Second objective study analyze feasibility automate conventional EEG analysis use NLEO-based algorithm ( nonlinear energy operator ) design automate detection SATs premature infant correlate result different sleep-wake-states . Third aim study compare two method ( automate versus visual analysis ) order develop evidence base analysis early sleep-stage development . The fourth aim study correlate sleep organisation later neuromotor cognitive outcome . Hypotheses : 1 . Video-EEG Polysomnography combination aEEG information reliable tool identify sleep development even extremely premature infant . 2 . Early sleep-wake cycle appear early gestation onwards healthy premature infant . They distinguish visually well automatically NLEO algorithm . 3 . The onset sleep-wake cycle regular cyclicity extremely premature infant good indicator normal brain function intact brain development , reflect mature neural network . 4 . Early sleep-wake cycle development impact later neurodevelopmental cognitive outcome premature infant . Methodological approach Patients During study period 36 month consecutively infant bear 29 week gestation admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) enrol study . Approvement local ethic committee already obtain ( EK-Nr . 67/2008 ) write parental consent acquire patient . At least 3 hour sleep monitoring perform every second week 36 week gestation use conventional video-EEG aEEG . Thus six different timepoints data acquisition : 24-25 ; 26-27 ; 28-29 ; 30-31 ; 32-33 34-35 week gestation . The first measurement perform first week life stabilization clinical state . Amplitude-integrated EEG ( aEEG ) The aEEG record single channel EEG biparietal surface disk electrode use CFM 6000 ( Olympic Medical , USA ) . The obtained signal filter , rectify , smooth amplitude-integrated write digitally available monitor slow speed ( 6 cm/h ) , directly bed side . Tracings evaluate visually classify accord method previously describe Hellström-Westas et al . ( 12 ) Descriptive analysis background activity aEEG tracing do divide trace 10-minute epoch . These 10-minute epoch wil classify five pattern category ( `` continuous pattern '' , `` discontinuous pattern '' , `` burst suppression pattern '' , `` low voltage activity '' `` flat trace '' ) . The presence sleep-wake-cycles seizure activity describe seperately . The percentage different pattern length quiet-sleep active sleep/wakefulness calculate entire aEEG trace . Conventional EEG Video-Polysomnography For assessment conventional EEG use Micromed System-Plus program . The Video-EEG evaluate accord method previously publish Ludington-Hoe/Scher ( 4,6 ) . EEG signal register electrode locate Fp1 , C3 , T3 , O1 , Fp2 , C4 , T4 , O2 accord International 10-20 System electrode placement adapt record neonate . `` Quiet Sleep '' define discontinuous pattern channel , low amplitude ( &lt; 20µV ) burst ( burst define distinct occurrence cerebral activity slow component associate faster activity ) often present approximately 2-10s long ( =Interburst Interval ) . The begin end `` discontinuous EEG-Segment '' marked Bursts Interburst-intervals amplitude frequency describe detail . They measure 20x 10min representative EEG epoch data average . Also clinical data like body movement , eye movement , heart rate respiratory rate measure 20 x 10min representative EEG epoch data average . `` Active sleep '' define continuous EEG-activity lasting longer 60 . Similarly amplitudes frequency burst interburst interval measure well mentioned clinical parameter . `` Wakefulness '' define electrophysiologically identical definition `` active sleep '' , difference determine accord behaviour analysis note video recording . `` Indeterminate sleep '' : EEG-segments , fully meet definitons last long &gt; 30 classified `` indeterminate sleep '' . `` Arousals '' define sudden asynchronuous change within EEG-pattern sleep state , associate body movement , muscle activity eye-openings last short 30 . Behavioral state classify Videomonitoring accord Holditch-Davies ( 5 ) . Quiet wake state define eye open opening , low motor activity even respiration . Active waking define eye open , cry , fuss generalized motor activity . Active sleep define eye close , uneven respiration intermittent rapid eye movement ( REM ) . Quiet sleep define eye beingt close even respiration Automated EEG analysis - NLEO algorithm The NLEO-based algorithm automate detection spontaneous activity transient ( SATs ; also call burst ) also use analyze 8 channel EEG data . The algorithm consist feature extraction classification algorithm , idea every sample EEG automatically characterize either SAT inter-SAT base detection use Nonlinear Energy Operator transformation ( NLEO ) . This methodology implement adult previously , recently adapt preterm EEG signal Vanhatalo group Helsinki ( 9-11 ) . The newly revise algorithm show agree well expert visual classification . SAT detection use calculate cumulative ( time-varying ) percentage SATs , length inter-SAT interval number SATs per minute . In context present study , approach offer possibility design algorithms automate objective assessment SWC . Our core interest endogenous cyclicity EEG pattern , analyze automate software , SATs , spatial characteristic regulation characterize . The NLEO enable analyze spatial characteristic oscillation different sleep-stages develop brain premature infant . Cranial Ultrasound All infant routinely assess use cranial ultrasound examination every week 32th week gestation every second week . Pathologies periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) intraventricular haemorrhage ( IVH ) , appear abnormality document follow . Neurodevelopmental follow All study patient involve neonatal follow program ass neurodevelopmental outcome . Neurodevelopmental outcome assess 1,2 3,5 year age assessment Bayley Scales Infant Development II age 5,5 year Kaufmann´s Assessment Battery Children ( K-ABC ) Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test Visual-Motor Integration ( VMI ) do experienced staff ( developmental psychologist pediatrician ) . The Bayley Scales classify normal psychomotor ( PDI ) mental developmental index ( MDI ) score &gt; 85 ; K-ABC VMI also consider normal &gt; 85 ( within 2 standard deviation reference value ) severely impaired &lt; 70 ( 3 standard deviation variance Cerebral Palsy define nonprogressive central nervous system disorder characterize abnormal muscle tone least one extremity abnormal control movement posture define due location hemiplegia , diplegia tetraplegia . Other include outcome variable visual acoustic impairment , form abnormality include ( need glasses/hearing aid , well blindness/deafness ) . Also detailed information regard environmental social perinatal risk factor collect . Statistical Analysis Occurrence duration different amplitude-integrated EEG pattern ( =continuous , discontinuous pattern ) give percentage descriptively compare already publish reference value . Occurrence duration describe conventional EEG feature ( =quiet sleep , active sleep indetermined sleep ) establish detailed component ( duration amplitude frequency burst interburst interval ) give mean per 10 minute epoch . In another step EEG activity correlate neurodevelopmental outcome Pearson´s correlation . The effect follow factor : `` percentage continuous pattern '' , `` percentage discontinuous pattern , `` percentage burst suppression pattern '' , , `` occurrence sleep-wake-cycling aEEG '' , occurrence seizure activity '' , `` mean amplitude burst '' , `` mean amplitude interburst interval `` , `` mean frequency burst '' , `` mean frequency interburst interval '' , `` appearance Delta Brush '' , '' appearance Theta Bursts '' , `` mean heart rate '' , `` mean respiratory rate '' , `` occurrence rapid eye movement '' `` mean body movement '' neurodevelopmental outcome estimate multinomial regression model ANOVA SPSS Statistics Version 17.0 Windows . P-values low 5 % consider indicating significance . Classification conventional EEG video-polysomnography do two author ( K.K Z.R ) interrater reliability ( Cohen´s Kappa ) determine . Detection SAT epoch NLEO-based detector assess , use sample sample method . This aim verify comparability prior study ( 10 ) use EEG signal EEG amplifier different specification . In next phase , NLEO-based index compare visual classification ( either raw EEG aEEG trend ) use epoch-based comparison use time series method case ( index visual classification ) output time series comparable feature . Expected results/deliverables Project success measure inclusion 60-80 patient , measure aEEG Polysomnography describe neurodevelopmental follow-up least age two year correct age , allow statistical analysis describe .</detailed_description>
