	<brief_summary>The main study objective compare conventional insulin therapy automate closed-loop glucose control achieve target glucose level hospitalise insulin-treated T2D subject 72 hour ( phase 1 ) inpatient hyperglycaemia require subcutaneous insulin therapy 15 day ( phase 2 ) . This open-label , two-arm , randomise , parallel design study hospitalise insulin-treated T2D subject ( phase 1 ) inpatient hyperglycaemia require subcutaneous insulin therapy ( phase 2 ) , target glucose level control either closed-loop system combine ( phase 1 ) daily basal insulin injection conventional insulin therapy random order .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperglycaemia hospitalize patient become common clinical problem due increase prevalence diabetes mellitus . Hyperglycaemia cohort also occur patient previously undiagnosed diabetes , acute illness previously normal glucose tolerance . As result , prevalence acute stress hyperglycaemia hospitalise patient widely report . A grow body evidence currently suggest degree hyperglycaemia upon admission duration hyperglycaemia illness associate adverse outcomes.In-patient hyperglycaemia widely recognise poor prognostic marker term morbidity mortality , increase length stay cost healthcare system . The current management in-patient hyperglycaemia non-critical care still far ideal , vary widely different centre . The discordance clinical evidence practice due number factor could potentially undermine patient care safety . Of , hypoglycaemia remain one big barrier manage in-patient hyperglycaemia . There therefore need develop validate effective safer system manage in-patient hyperglycaemia . A closed-loop insulin infusion system previously test report feasible safe intensive care patient . Its utilisation non-critical patient general medical surgical ward currently remain unproven . Its use cohort however could potentially significant practical clinical value , especially busy ward environment . The Model Predictive Control ( MPC ) algorithm develop group University Cambridge utilise fundamental glucoregulatory process predict future glucose excursion result project insulin infusion rate . The algorithm also account patient 's meal intake duration action short act insulin use . This distinct advantage `` reactive '' approach slide scale insulin protocol , treat hyperglycaemia already occur . The MPC algorithm study intensive care cardiac surgery patient , result study date encouraging . It show associate significantly high percentage time within blood glucose target range , without increase risk severe hypoglycaemia . The expectant role closed-loop system use MPC algorithm non-critical care patient would therefore provide clinician effective safe method manage hyperglycaemia hospital .</detailed_description>
