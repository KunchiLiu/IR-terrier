	<brief_summary>Gum disease type 2 diabetes common chronic disease affect . Diabetes increase , especially Pakistan . People diabetes great risk gum disease . Also , think gum disease , chronic infection , source systemic inflammation may contribute poor diabetes control . The aim project study : 1 . Changes sugar control people type 2 diabetes severe gum disease teeth remove replaced Straumann dental implant full dentures 2 . Changes certain inflammation marker see insulin resistance disease condition common people diabetes 3 . Retention dental implant people type 2 diabetes . The study recruit 30 patient type 2 diabetes severe gum disease Dr. Amin Rahman 's private practice Pakistan . Their long-term sugar ( HbA1c ) must 7.5 % inflammatory marker , C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) 1mg/dL . Consenting participant first oral examination . Eligible patient impression jaw color teeth gum record . At next visit , teeth extract denture provide . One week later , check-up visit . Three month teeth remove , Straumann dental implant place jaw . After one week , patient check . After three month , denture adjust fit implant . Follow-up visit occur every three month one year implant place , every six month next five year , check health patient well implant , gum around , denture . Blood sample take follow-up visit . Our hypothesis level HbA1c hsCRP : 1. decrease extraction teeth 2. increase placement dental implant 3. increase prosthetic restoration full denture anchor dental implant .</brief_summary>
