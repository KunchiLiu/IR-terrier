	<detailed_description>The project investigate role cortical region , sub-thalamic nucleus pedunculo-pontine nucleus preparation volitional movement termination patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) receive deep brain stimulation . Currently two model inhibitory preparation volitional movement . The `` withdrawal mechanism '' posit explanation movement termination due '' shut '' activate neuralcircuitry , whereas `` inhibition mechanism '' suggest inhibitory neural structure activate terminate voluntary movement . These hypothesis deduce study scalp movement-related cortical potential recording deep structure involve execution movement termination uncertain . Movement preparation prior movement onset ( Mon ) address scalp recording MRCP recent study STN PD patient . However , electro-physiologic information concern role STN preparation movement offset ( Moff ) less understood . In pilot study , find high-beta event-related de-synchronization ( ERD ) appear early ( 3 second prior Mon ) low-beta alpha Mon phasic movement.There alpha ERD Mon tonic movement . Alpha , low-beta , high-beta ERD appear 1 second prior Moff tonic movement . These finding suggest STN participate preparation volitional movement termination via different mechanism movement initiation.Unlike asynchronous ERD frequency band present movement initiation , simultaneous ERD across wide frequency band STN may play pivotal role terminate volitional movement . Since tight connection cortical region STN , intrigue know relationship oscillatory pattern deep superficial neural structure . In current proposal , examine pattern ERD ERS prior Mon Moff tonic movement cortical STN region determine temporal relationship among .</detailed_description>
