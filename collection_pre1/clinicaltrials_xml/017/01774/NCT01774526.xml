	<brief_summary>Lung Cancer continue major cause cancer-related mortality Singapore . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 75 % lung cancer adenocarcinoma common histological subtype . Although cigarette-smoking main cause lung cancer , third afflict Singapore never-smokers 69 % affect female . For majority present advance NSCLC , chemotherapy mainstay treatment . Despite advance make newer chemotherapeutic agent , apparent benefit conventional chemotherapy plateaued . Efforts toward develop novel treatment base grow understanding molecular oncology yield drug target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . They expand treatment option patient advanced NSCLC . However , monoclonal antibody VEGF contraindicate patient squamous cell carcinoma due increase incidence fatal hemoptysis . EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) appear promise 40 % east-asian female never-smokers lung adenocarcinoma harbour EGFR gene mutation . Estrogen , KRAS , BRAF , ERBE genetic mutation confound response . Molecular data obtain Caucasian predominantly east-asian population may apply multi-ethnic group aim determine molecular characteristic multi-ethnic asian phenotype well understand process carcinogenesis treatment response well identify potential novel target future drug development . Paraffin-embedded tissue recall , DNA extract mutational analysis , correlate patient demographic , treatment outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer malignant disease heterogeneous histology divide 2 major group ; small cell lung cancer non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . NSCLC account 75 % lung cancer , exhibit different pathway resistance treatment . It increasingly apparent effective treatment NSCLC require multiple drug attack different target . This realization set stage future individualize therapy depend molecular characteristic NSCLC target various pathway . AIMS 1 . Describe molecular epidemiology lung adenocarcinoma multi-ethnic asian phenotype . 2 . Correlate tumor molecular characteristic patient demographic outcome good understand carcinogenesis well discovery novel target future drug development .</detailed_description>
