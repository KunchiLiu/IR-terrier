	<brief_summary>A prospective case-control study perform investigate effect iloprost intraoperative flow volume diabetic non-diabetic patient well effect peripheral neuropathy patient peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD ) undergo arterial reconstruction ( primary endpoint ) . 100 patient undergoing femoral artery reconstruction femorodistal bypass surgery include . Prior surgery , peripheral nerve conduction velocity measure . Blood flow volume common femoral artery assess use Doppler flowmeter ( Sono TT FlowLab ; ) reconstruction , prior intraarterial application 3000ng iloprost 5 10 minute afterwards . Peripheral resistance unit ( PRU ) calculate function mean systemic arterial pressure ( MAP ) flow volume ( VF ) : PRU = MAP ( mmHg ) / VF ( ml/min ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The therapeutic property prostanoids appear primarily due vasodilative effect . However , inhibition platelet aggregation limitation thrombus formation inhibition adhesion leucocytes endothelial lesion also help improve blood flow peripheral circulation . It currently unclear effect prostanoids predominant diabetic patient . The present study perform assess potential difference iloprost efficiency patient without type II diabetes mellitus without peripheral neuropathy . The study single center , control , non- randomize interventional study . All patient provide write consent . The study approve Ethics Committee city Vienna 2012 ( EC nr : 11-144-0512 ) extend annually last two year . Performance study comply World Medical Association Declaration Helsinki regard ethical conduct research involve human subject . The study design enroll 100 consecutive patient peripheral arterial occlusive disease undergo surgical reconstruction inguinal artery and/or femorodistal bypass surgery . Indication surgery include PAOD Fontaine stage IIb ( wake distance le 200 meter ) , III ( rest pain ) IV ( tissue loss ) . Surgical procedure plan absence inflow stenosis verify base MRI CT angiography . Exclusion criterion participation study comprise contraindication application iloprost well plan spinal anesthesia . Patients divide two group base diabetic type II non-diabetic . Before surgery measurement nerve conduction velocity perform trained nurse Department Physiotherapy order determine presence neuropathy . Surgery perform general anesthesia via longitudinal skin incision . After systemic administration 5000 IU unfractionated Heparin , peripheral vessel clamp . After longitudinal arteriotomy , thrombendarterectomy common femoral artery perform case , extend deep femoral artery superficial femoral artery necessary . In case , follow femoropopliteal bypass surgery . Provided systolic blood pressure equal 100 mmHg end reconstruction , 3000 ng iloprost ( Ilomedin ) , dilute 15ml saline solution , injected common femoral artery . Distal injection site doppler flow measurement perform common femoral artery prior arteriotomy , prior intraarterial application iloprost , 5 10 minute afterwards , use Sono TT FlowLab instrument ( em-Tec GmbH , Munich ) . Transmission head select fit tightly around reconstruct vessel without produce stenosis . During procedure , systemic arterial blood pressure continuously document use pressure transducer connect intraarterial cannula place radial artery forearm . The result arterial reconstruction routinely check intraoperative on- table angiography . Before discharge hospital surgical reconstruction control duplex ultrasound well assessment ankle brachial index . Statistical analysis perform SPSS 15.0 Windows ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Ill ) . To correct measurement flow volume blood pressure , peripheral resistance unit ( PRU ) calculate function mean systemic arterial pressure ( MAP ) flow volume ( VF ) : PRU = MAP ( mmHg ) / VF ( ml/min ) . The patient population stratify presence diabetes presence peripheral neuropathy operate limb . Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirm normal distribution continuous variable . Descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation , range ) apply acquire data , test dependent independent variable use comparison continuous variable , applicable . Categorical variable express frequency percentage , difference group investigate Pearson Chi -square Fisher exact test . Patient characteristic potentially modulate effect iloprost investigate linear regression analysis . P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
