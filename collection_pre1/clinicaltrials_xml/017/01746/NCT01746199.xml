	<brief_summary>Given resistance emergence malaria pregnant woman receive intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( IPT-SP ) burden infection among pregnant woman infect HIV urgent seek effective alternative treatment optimize prevention malaria . Cotrimoxazole ( CTM ) , actually administer daily prophylactic mean opportunistic infection HIV infect patient , show encouraging result prevent malaria pregnant woman . However , result must confirm randomized trial , particularly pregnant woman . The main objective clinical trial compare efficacy cotrimoxazole ( CTM ) , administer daily IPT-SP ( 3 curative dos space one month ) placental parasitaemia pregnant woman infect HIV cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) &gt; 350 cells/mm3 . The main hypothesis base premise cotrimoxazole effective IPT-SP placental parasitaemia . This might due high plasma concentration cotrimoxazole attain daily dos . If hypothesis proven , cotrimoxazole could recommend prophylaxis HIV-positive pregnant woman , whatever CD4+ cell count . In study , investigator also test hypothesis strain Plasmodium falciparum isolate HIV-positive pregnant woman express dhfr dhps resistance marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Antifolates Against Malaria HIV-infected Pregnant Women Emergence Induced Resistance Plasmodium Falciparum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ascertainment HIV serological status become prerequisite good prevention malaria . Studies report cotrimoxazole reduces malaria episode adult ( pregnant woman ) , child . Furthermore , several study show good clinical parasitological response cotrimoxazole treat child . Therefore , preventive treatment SP HIV+ patient ( include pregnant woman ) receive treatment contain cotrimoxazole superfluous even contraindicate increase risk severe adverse reaction . Few study , however , describe efficacy cotrimoxazole prevention malaria pregnant woman , particularly area frequency therapeutic failure SP case Plasmodium falciparum malaria increase . The emergence augmentation frequency resistance Plasmodium falciparum SP , already observe numerous country sub-Saharan Africa Central African Republic , challenge short-term usefulness drug combination prevention malaria pregnant woman . The resistance due accumulation point mutation various site gene cod dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) dihydropteroate synthase ( dhps ) . The number mutation correlate extent resistance Plasmodium falciparum SP vitro . In study carry Bangui , prevalence therapeutic failure estimate 23.8 % 14 day follow-up among child uncomplicated malaria , resistance Plasmodium falciparum pyrimethamine vitro report 38.3 % . The frequency mutation dhfr dhps allele correlate vitro response Plasmodium falciparum strain SP . Pregnancy HIV infection increase risk emergence mutate strain resistant SP , wide variety type clone find parasitaemia pregnant woman ( genetic diversity ) . Furthermore , study raise concern possible development cross-resistance Plasmodium falciparum cotrimoxazole SP similarity mode action , although hypothesis proven . The national malaria programme Central African Republic recommend use IPT-SP since 2006 . The investigator ' main hypothesis base premise cotrimoxazole effective SP placental parasitaemia . This might due high plasma concentration cotrimoxazole attain daily dos . If hypothesis proven , cotrimoxazole could recommend prophylaxis HIV+ pregnant woman , whatever CD4+ cell count . In study , investigator also test hypothesis strain Plasmodium falciparum isolate HIV+ positive pregnant woman express dhfr dhps resistance marker .</detailed_description>
