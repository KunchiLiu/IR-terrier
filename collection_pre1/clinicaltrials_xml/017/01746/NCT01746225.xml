	<brief_summary>Longer first line chemotherapy duration recently associate modest , significant improvement overall survival clinically meaningful statistically significant improvement progression-free survival , metastatic breast cancer patient . Prolonging chemotherapy disease progression , however , must weigh detrimental effect continuous chemotherapy delivery . The SNAP trial seek improve tolerability prolong chemotherapy administration strategy study alternative treatment schedule , preserve possibly improve treatment efficacy disease set . The availability new nanoparticle albumin-bound taxane , nab-Paclitaxel ( AbraxaneÂ® ) , represent opportunity test hypothesis . Nab-Paclitaxel develop attempt reduce toxicity associate standard taxane administration ( cause use chemical solvent ) increase antitumor efficacy . The SNAP randomize phase II trial evaluates three schedule nab-Paclitaxel prolong chemotherapy administration strategy . Each three arm compare historical reference seven-month median progression-free survival ( PFS ) base recent trial docetaxel control arm determine whether three arm worthy investigation .</brief_summary>
