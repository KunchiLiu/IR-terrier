	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose stereotactic body radiation therapy give together ablation therapy treat patient non-small cell lung cancer lung metastasis . Ablation therapy , radiofrequency ablation use high-frequency , electric current kill tumor cell . Ablation therapy , microwave ablation kill tumor cell heat several degree normal body temperature . Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Giving ablation therapy together stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IR-guided Ablation ( IRGA ) Combined With Stereotactic Ablative Radiation ( SABR ) Large Lung Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This dose-escalation study stereotactic body radiation therapy . Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy daily ( QD ) total 5 fraction undergo IRGA ( either radiofrequency ablation microwave ablation ) 1 week later . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
