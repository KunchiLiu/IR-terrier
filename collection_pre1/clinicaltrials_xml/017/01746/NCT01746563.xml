	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy combination therapy ranibizumab ( RBZ ) panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) versus PRP alone patient treatment-naive bilateral proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) measure mean change visual acuity ( VA ) , mean change central retinal thickness ( CRT ) measure time-domain optic coherence tomography ( TD-OCT ) incidence vitreous hemorrhage ( VH ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab Combined With Panretinal Photocoagulation Patients With Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparative efficacy combine treatment include intravitreal injection 0.5 mg Lucentis ( ranibizumab ) laser photocoagulation patient Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( PDR ) . Objectives : Primary objective : The primary objective evaluate efficacy combine treatment ranibizumab laser photocoagulation versus laser photocoagulation alone patient severe PDR mean change BCVA V7/M6 compare baseline . The Best Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) measure Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( EDTRS ) . Secondary objective : To evaluate difference Optic Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) retinal thickness total macular volume combine treatment regiment include intravitreal injection 0,5 mg Lucentis ( ranibizumab ) laser photocoagulation patient PDR visit 7 compare baseline assessment . To evaluate percentage patient present vitreous hemorrhage begin laser treatment visit 7 compare baseline assessment . Strategic goal : The main goal study evaluate use intravitreal ranibizumab eye submit Pan-Retinal Photocoagulation ( PRP ) due PDR induces less macular edema less vitreous hemorrhage therefore lead well visual outcome</detailed_description>
