	<brief_summary>Currently , health care people receive approximately 20 year behind up-to-date research finding . Developing way narrow gap evidence practice important research focus continue care facility , especially one considers demand facility estimate increase ten-fold next 25 year . In Alberta , estimate 27,400 healthcare aide work continue care sector . Developing reminder target care provider increase likelihood significant resource invest promote uptake research finding lead sustain practice change , ultimately , improved client outcome . The purpose START project ( Sustaining Transfers Affordable Research Translation ) help bridge gap research practice supportive living long-term care facility study effectiveness reminder intervention support sustainability research-based mobility innovation . In particular , project evaluate frequency intensity reminder maintain daily practice healthcare aide carry mobility innovation client 24 supportive living long-term care facility . We compare monthly versus every three month reminder , compare paper-based reminder ( like sticker chart ) reminder provide healthcare aide peer . Using interview , questionnaire observation , START project also evaluate process inhibit promote uptake mobility innovation healthcare aide daily practice . In build bridge research evidence practice , work closely stakeholder level healthcare delivery ( e.g . healthcare aide , facility leader , policy maker researcher ) throughout study . We expect collaboration contribute sustainable innovation continue care sector , particular , sustain use affordable mobility innovation supportive living long-term care setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose cluster randomize control trial study effectiveness reminder support sustainability affordable mobility innovation healthcare aide supportive live long-term care facility . Using stratify 2x2 factorial design , determine combination frequency intensity reminder require sustain mobility innovation , sit-to-stand activity . Four research question guide study : 1 ) Do frequent reminder ( every month ) improve sustainability innovation healthcare aide supportive live long-term care facility compare less frequent reminder ( every 3 month ) ? 2 ) Do high-intensity reminder ( paper-based reminder plus peer reminder ) improve sustainability innovation healthcare aide supportive live long-term care facility compare low intensity reminder ( paper-based reminder ) ? 3 ) Do frequent reminder plus high-intensity reminder synergistically improve sustainability innovation healthcare aide supportive live long-term care facility ? 4 ) What process associate ongoing uptake innovation year follow-up ? We propose study effect varying level ( frequency intensity ) reminders sustainability mobility innovation healthcare aide . Frequency : Our Alberta Health Services collaborator advise monthly modification paper reminder would frequent yet feasible align rhythm monthly managerial responsibility ; contrast , every three month would infrequent would align quarterly managerial responsibility . Intensity : They agree paper-based reminder low intensity commonly use clinical setting . For high intensity reminder favor socially-based `` peer reminder '' . To summarize , level reminder vary frequency ( monthly versus every three month ) intensity ( paper reminder versus paper reminder + peer reminder ) . Project Plan : Facility assessment : Eligible facility minimum 30 designated supportive living bed long-term care bed Edmonton zone . In first six month , conduct facility assessment 24 potential facility use Alberta Context Tool , Work Well Being Survey , Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set 2.0 . Data assessment use stratify facility three 'equivalent ' group randomization . As part organizational eligibility , participate facility agree incorporate mobility innovation best practice policy client . Education session : In collaboration facility-based educator , study educator complete 20-minute education session train healthcare aide work day even shift complete innovation . Randomization : A stratified blocked randomization procedure assign facility four intervention arm . Immediately follow randomization , introduce simple set paper-based reminder site . The low intensity paper-based reminder include : ) affix sticker door , wall , bathroom ; b ) post reminder sign prominent location ; c ) place color flag documentation flowsheets . Every month high frequency site , every three month low frequency site , modify color shape paper-based reminder . For high intensity reminder , identify healthcare aide offer peer reminder . These healthcare aide provide formal informal peer reminder innovation ; formal reminder take place either monthly every three month change shift meeting , informal reminder provide opportunity arise work day . Every month high frequency site every three month low frequency site , study educator coach healthcare aide provide peer reminder . As purpose study examine effectiveness reminder support sustainability innovation healthcare aide , primary outcome healthcare aide uptake operationalized number complete mobility occasion . We validate documentation flowsheet use healthcare aide . They record flowsheet number mobility repetition client complete two occasion day shift even shift ( i.e . four occasion per day ) . The secondary outcome measure client mobility , assess use 30-second sit-to-stand test . Clients time see many repetition stand sit complete 30-seconds . This measure gather baseline participate client , 1 year later . Process Evaluation ( Research Question 4 ) : The goal process evaluation understand facility process reminder affect sustainability healthcare aide uptake innovation . We examine reminder implement perceived participant , well healthcare aide provide peer reminder identify , receive peer support supervisor . This data gather use observation , questionnaire interview . Observations : Anytime research staff enter study facility , alert observe response facility staff client reminder intervention . Upon exit facility , record fieldnotes . Research staff instruct include general information fieldnotes , include information would identify specific site staff client . Educators ' fieldnotes useful understanding process response coach healthcare aide provide reminder . Questionnaire : We survey license practical nurse manager facility use questionnaire elicit perception reminder . Interviews-Healthcare Aides : To understand healthcare aide ' view reminder use interview rather write questionnaire , many healthcare aide speak English second language . We interview approximately 6 healthcare aide purposively sample facility achieve saturation . Four facility ( 2 positive &amp; 2 negative extreme case ; one arm ) sample base facility assessment . Interviews-Peer Reminders : To understand peer reminder experience interview approximately 6 healthcare aide provide peer reminder high intensity reminder arm saturation achieve .</detailed_description>
