	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study . It also mean FDA yet approve afatinib use patient . In research study investigator look see take afatinib surgery work well take short period time , compare long period time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Afatinib Stage I-III NSCLC With EGFR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order determine one eligible participate study would ask undergo screen test procedure . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn one take part research study . If patient test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , performance status , physical exam vital sign include height weight , assessment tumor , routine blood test , pregnancy test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram and/or multigated acquisition scan . If test show patient eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If one meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Because one know study option best , patient `` randomize '' one study group . They take afatinib mouth every day either 3 month ( short course ) 2 year ( long course ) . Randomization mean one put group chance . It like flip coin . Neither patient , research doctor choose group patient . You 50/50 chance place group . Regardless study group one put , patient take afatinib mouth every day . The first cycle last 28 day . All cycle last 25-31 day . Patients take medication ( tablet ) mouth day , time day . They take afatinib glass water . Afatinb treatment continue assign course complete , side effect tolerate , one decide stop study treatment , lung cancer return . Patients ask come clinic follow time point : - Day 1 8 Cycle 1 - Day 1 Cycles 2 , 3 4 - Off treatment visit-28 day last dose study drug If one assign long course , one also need come clinic visit Day 1 Cycles 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 25 . If one assign short course , one need come additional clinic visit . The following test procedures do monitor side effect afatinib . - Routine blood tests-about 2 tablespoon blood - Performance status - Physical exam vital sign , include height weight The following test procedures do monitor recurrence lung cancer . These visit , regardless whether one take short course , long course afatinib . There clinic visit every 6 month 3 year ( month 7 , 13 , 19 , 25 , 31 , 37 49 ) , one visit 1 year later . The following test procedures do follow visit : CT scan chest , routine blood test , performance status physical exam , include height weight .</detailed_description>
