	<criteria>Subjects investigator believe parent ( ) /Legally Acceptable Representative ( ) [ LAR ( ) ] comply requirement protocol . Written inform consent obtain parent ( ) /LAR ( ) subject inform assent obtain subject , appropriate , prior enrollment . Female subject nonchild bear potential may enrol study . ( Nonchild bear potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy ovariectomy ) . Female subject child bear potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior first vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series . Priming status : Children previously vaccinate pneumococcal vaccine , i.e . either plain polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine , Synflorix ( 10PnPDDiT ) , Prevenar Prevenar13 consider inclusion unprimed group . Children previously vaccinate : least one dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , i.e . either Synflorix ( 10PnPDDiT ) , Prevenar Prevenar13 plain polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine 2 year less 5 year enrollment . consider inclusion prim group . Additional inclusion criterion Atrisk group : A male female age , include , 2 17 year time first vaccination . For purpose study , atrisk subject subject : Congenital acquire asplenia anatomic , surgical functional asplenia Splenic dysfunction , chronic gastrointestinal disorder , liver disease , infiltrative disorder , vascular disorder etc Note : All individual diagnose investigator splenic dysfunction eligible enrollment Atrisk group . When available , investigator collect medical documentation reduce splenic function diagnose appropriate technique Atrisk subject 's medical record . No assessment necessary . A maximum 35 individual sicklecell disease enrol Atrisk group . These subject require assessment splenic function sicklecell disease invariably associate severe splenic dysfunction . Complement deficiency . For subject define Atrisk Investigator make effort collect information subject/subject 's parent ( ) /LAR ( ) interview and/or previously available medical documentation date condition make child atrisk pneumococcal infection and/or result test determine spleen dysfunction complement deficiency . This document medical record Atrisk subject . No originals/copies medical documentation need . Additional inclusion criterion Healthy group : A male female match ( age country ) subject age 2459 month Atrisk group . Healthy subject establish medical history clinical examination enter study . Child care . Use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine ( ) within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine , plan use study period . Planned administration/administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day dose vaccine ( ) end 30 day after* . * In case emergency mass vaccination unforeseen public health threat organise public health authority , outside routine immunization program , vaccine administer time study period provide license used accord Summary Product Characteristics Prescribing Information accord local governmental recommendation write approval Sponsor provide . Vaccines recommend subject increase risk bacterial infection , administered time subject enrol Atrisk group . Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , subject expose investigational noninvestigational product ( pharmaceutical product device ) . History neurological disorder seizure . Acute disease and/or fever time enrollment . History chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse . Any confirm suspected Human Immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , base medical history physical examination . History reaction hypersensitivity likely exacerbate component vaccine . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 3 month precede first dose study vaccine plan administration study period . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution . Major congenital defect except medical condition define Atrisk subject . Previous vaccination pneumococcal infection pneumococcal conjugate vaccine within last 8 week . Previous vaccination pneumococcal infection plain polysaccharide vaccine within last 2 year . Additional exclusion criterion Healthy group : Chronic administration immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within six month prior first vaccine dose . Inhaled topical steroid allow . Serious chronic illness . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , base medical history physical examination .
