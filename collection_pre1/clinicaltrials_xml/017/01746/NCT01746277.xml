	<brief_summary>There two different treatment mode NSCLC patient fail epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) initially respond EGFR-TKI . One EGFR-TKI combine chemotherapy chemotherapy follow EGFR-TKI . It unclear one suitable group lung cancer patient . So phase Ⅱclinical trial design compare efficiency safety two different treatment mode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Chemotherapy Sequenced Combined With EGFR-TKIs NSCLC Patients Failed EGFR-TKIs Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Responses EGFR-TKIs quiet dramatic durable , especially patient EGFR gene classic mutation , 19 deletion 21 leucine 858 arginine ( L858R ) . However , patient NSCLC respond EGFR-TKIs eventually experience progression disease approximately 12 month . The lack establish therapeutic option NSCLC patient progressive disease EGFR-TKIs failure pose great challenge physician term best manage grow group lung cancer patient . In clinical practice initially EGFR-TKI sensitive tumor progress evidence strike increase tumor volume within several week , take EGFR-TKI . This response call `` rebound phenomenon '' . Most expert still believe tumor continue `` oncogene-addicted '' EGFR . So rational EGFR-TKI combine another chemotherapy regimen use treat NSCLC failure EGFR-TKI therapy . However phase Ⅱclinical trial involve NSCLC patient fail EGFR-TKI therapy , another treatment mode , say , least one cytotoxic chemotherapy use firstly switch EGFR-TKI therapy progression disease , use call reintroduction retreatment EGFR-TKI . Using treatment mode , investigator report partial remission ( PR ) disease control rate ( DCR ) observe 21.7 % -36 % 65.2 % -86 % NSCLC patient .</detailed_description>
