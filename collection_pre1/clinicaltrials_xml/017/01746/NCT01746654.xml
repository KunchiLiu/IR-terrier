	<detailed_description>Staphylococcus aureus acquire multiple-drug resistance pose increase problem hospital community setting . S. aureus know cause infection range severity skin infection systemic bacteremia . As nasal colonization principal ecological niche bacteria show significant risk factor develop S. aureus infection , importance develop efficient therapy able clear bacterium human nostril . In-vivo study show P128 treatment efficacious reduce decolonize MRSA bacteria rat nostril . Pre-clinical safety study animal model indicate test drug relate toxicity sign site application systemically . The present clinical trial conduct four part . Part A consists safety tolerability study 4 cohort 3 healthy subject administer single dose three escalate concentration drug placebo intra-nasally . Part B consist safety &amp; tolerability part A multiple dos ( 3 doses/day 5 day ) . Part C comprise safety/tolerability well efficacy study chronic kidney disease patient stable dialysis nasal carrier S.aureus MRSA treatment regimen Part B . Part D comprise safety efficacy study patient nasal carrier S.aureus MRSA single dose 3 escalating concentration drug placebo intra-nasally .</detailed_description>
