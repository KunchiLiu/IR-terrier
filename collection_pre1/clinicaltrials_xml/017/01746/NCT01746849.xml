	<brief_summary>The purpose study help determine palifermin leuprolide acetate help immune system recover fast follow stem cell transplant . Blood stem cell young blood cell grow body become red white blood cell platelet . The transplant us stem cell blood another person . The donor family member volunteer donor . This call allogeneic stem cell transplant . The investigator want see palifermin leuprolide acetate help immune system recover fast allogenic transplant experiment show may able .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palifermin With Leuprolide Acetate Promotion Immune Recovery Following Total Body Irradiation Based T-Cell Depleted Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize one two arm : palifermin Lupron , control . The control arm consist standard TCD allo-HSCT without addition palifermin Lupron . Patients randomize receive Lupron receive three month depot dose 3-6 week prior start date pre-transplant conditioning regimen . Patients assign receive palifermin receive drug 60mcg/kg/day IV three consecutive day , 24 hour apart last dose administer less 24 48 hour prior start cytoreduction . The preparative regimen use transplant consist : hyperfractionated TBI administer 11 dos 4 day total 1375 cGy , thiotepa 5 mg/kg/day IV x 2 day cyclophosphamide mesna prophylaxis 60 mg/kg/day IV x 2 day . All patient receive ATG two dos prior transplant , except recipient mismatch graft ( GVHD vector ) receive three dos . G-CSF mobilize CD34 PBSCs obtain HLA compatible donor infuse day 0 . Patients assign receive palifermin receive three additional daily dos drug , first approximately 6 hour stem cell infusion day 0 , follow two daily dos give 24 hour interval d+1 d+2 . Patients assign receive Lupron receive 3-month depot injection approximately 3 month ( +/- one week ) post first dose . Supportive care administer per BMT Service guideline . The condition regimen may modify allow extra day condition prior graft infusion require donor and/or patient schedule restriction .</detailed_description>
