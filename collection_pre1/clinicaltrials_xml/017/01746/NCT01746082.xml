	<detailed_description>This Phase II open-label study approximately 200 ( 240 ) healthy male non-pregnant female , age 18 year old . This study design assess safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivate influenza H3N2 variant ( H3N2v ) vaccine ( MIV ) manufacture Sanofi Pasteur . Subjects stratify age ( approximately 100 ( 120 ) subject 18-64 year old approximately 100 ( 120 ) subject &gt; /= 65 year old ) receive two dos H3N2v MIV , deliver intramuscularly 15 microgram ( mcg ) hemagglutinin ( HA ) /0.5 milliliter ( mL ) dose , 21 day apart ( see Table 1 ) . Subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine prior ( 2 week give inactivated vaccine 4 week give live , attenuated vaccine ) first H3N2v vaccination . Alternatively , subject may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine time completion Day 42 visit follow early termination visit . Safety measure occurrence solicit injection site systemic reactogenicity day H3N2v vaccination 7 day H3N2v vaccination , adverse event 42 day first H3N2v vaccination , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) new-onset chronic medical condition 7 month first H3N2v vaccination . Immunogenicity test include perform hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) neutralizing ( Neut ) antibody assay serum obtain day prior H3N2v vaccination ( Days 0 21 ) , approximately 8 day H3N2v vaccination ( Days 8 29 ) , approximately 21 day second H3N2v vaccination ( Day 42 ) . From subset healthy adult subject ( 30 volunteer 18-64 year old enrol Emory VTEU site consent blood donation immunology exploratory assay ) , additional volume venous blood drawn Days 0 , 8 , 21 , 29 42 determine specificity/cross reactivity antibodies H3N2v-reactive B cell influenza subtypes ( e.g. , 2009 H1N1 pandemic HA ) recent H3 seasonal HA define molecular profile antibody repertoire change circulate B cell H3N2v vaccination , characterize antibody-secreting cell ( ASC ) , monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , CD4+ T cell response H3N2v vaccination .
