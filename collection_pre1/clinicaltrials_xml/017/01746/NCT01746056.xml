	<brief_title>A Comparative Study Occlusive Heat Patch Treatment Warts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) virus cause verruca , wart , skin , particularly distal extremity , lesion mucous membrane . Warts highly prevalent , occur 13 % general population around 25 % otherwise healthy child . About 67 % wart resolve spontaneously within two year ; however 25 % persist many year , result pain dysfunction impart significant psychosocial problem . Localized hyperthermia ( warm ) report effective treatment HPV-induced wart nearly two decade . A novel method treat wart heat use occlusive patch contain mixture chemical ( ferric chloride ) , presence oxygen reacts generate reproducible thermal warm skin temperature 42-43ºC least two hour . The heat believe alter immune response kill HPV virus wart tissue .</detailed_description>
