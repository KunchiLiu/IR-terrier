When phone receive alert , ring , vibrate display text message say `` CPR NEEDED '' . The user 's current location exact location cardiac arrest display map . Nearby public access AEDs also indicate map . The smartphone user go provide chest compression use AED paramedic way . A video www.pulsepoint.org show work . The objective investigator measure whether PulsePoint smartphone application increase bystander CPR AED use victim cardiac arrest outside hospital . This project happen City Toronto . The investigator plan get many people possible download application , focus health care professional know CPR . The investigator set webpage help people download software phone . The investigator randomize 911 call PulsePoint alert sent . The investigator use statistical analysis measure whether send alert smartphone increase chance bystander resuscitation .</brief_summary>
