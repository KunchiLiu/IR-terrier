	<brief_summary>Assessment retinal vessel caliber combine bidirectional Fourier domain optical coherence tomography ( FDOCT ) measurement retinal blood velocity new sophisticated method assess retinal blood flow human . The valid measurement retinal blood flow significant importance , know major ophthalmic disease associate alteration blood flow . As , retinal vascular occlusive disease represent major cause visual impairment blindness . The prevalence disease 0.7 1.6 % . Compression retinal vein arterio-venous ( AV ) crossing play important role development branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . The mechanical narrowing vessel lumen suppose mechanism behind fact . The present study elucidate BRVO influence retinal blood flow retinal vessel crossing comparison healthy control subject . Retinal blood flow retinal bifurcation also assess . In addition , fundus image take assess retinal oxygen saturation . For first time use combination dynamic vessel analyzer ( DVA ) bidirectional Fourier domain optical coherence tomography ( FDOCT ) assess retinal blood flow . Whereas DVA provide information concern retinal vessel caliber , FDOCT provide laser Doppler information addition conventional optical coherence tomography , allow observation blood flow dynamic simultaneously . In present study hypothesize DVA combination FDOCT suitable new tool assessment blood flow healthy subject patient BRVO .</brief_summary>
