	<brief_title>Topical Application Cocaine HCl 4 % 10 % Safety Efficacy Local ( Topical ) Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized , prospective , multisite , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study Placebo Topical Solution versus Cocaine HCl 4 % 10 % Topical Solution anesthetic prior diagnostic procedure surgery . In Safety Efficacy first phase , subject randomize 1:1:1 fashion one three treatment group ( placebo , Cocaine HCl 4 % 10 % topical solution ) pre-procedure give one application 4 mL one bottle assigned test product . After pre-procedure Von Frey filament testing , blind broken , relative placebo versus cocaine , relative strength cocaine . The placebo subject exit participation efficacy portion trial , follow safety 7 day . Treatment group subject feel pain Von Frey test receive surgery diagnostic procedure also follow safety 7 day . In Safety second phase , subject randomize 1:1 fashion one two treatment group ( Cocaine HCl 4 % 10 % topical solution ) pre-procedure give one application one 4 mL assign test product . After pre-procedure Von Frey filament testing reveals pain score 0 , subject receive surgery diagnostic procedure , subject follow safety 7 day .</detailed_description>
