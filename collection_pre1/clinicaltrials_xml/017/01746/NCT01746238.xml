	<brief_summary>The main purpose study test safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose , effectiveness bevacizumab combination chemotherapy radiation therapy . Because bevacizumab consider standard therapy sarcoma , give subject sarcoma enrol research study may administer direction doctor investigator research study . This study do sarcoma recur surgical resection ( surgery removal tumor ) , radiation therapy chemotherapy . This recurrence occur location original tumor distant sit lung . Thus good treatment need . This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational drug , combination drug , combination drug radiation . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug radiation still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve bevacizumab doxorubicin radiation type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order determine patient eligible study patient undergo screen procedure , include medical history , physical examination , performance status , assessment tumor , chest CT scan , blood test , urine test , electrocardiogram echocardiogram . Patients also undergo blood test tumor biopsy look marker particular type cancer . If determined patient eligible study need central venous line ( CVL ) , peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC ) , portacath placement . Doxorubicin administration require central venous line , peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC ) portacath place allow continuous infusion drug . Since investigator look high tolerable dose study drug , bevacizumab , administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant sarcoma , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose patient get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . The dose doxorubicin radiation therapy subject throughout study . Bevacizumab give intravenous infusion ( IV ) . The first infusion take 90 minute . All bevacizumab infusion take either 60 30 minute , tolerate . The first infusion give Monday ( exclude holiday ) . Patients receive second infusion 2 week later every 2 week total 3 dos . Doxorubicin give intravenous infusion ( IV ) . It give port via infusion pump size large wallet fit front-pack `` fanny-pack '' around waist . This pump connect body . The nurse infusion room start pump disconnect 4 day . The first bolus infusion take give 1-2 hour first bevacizumab infusion take 30 minute . This follow continuous IV infusion doxorubicin 4 day . The first bolus infusion give Monday ( exclude holiday ) continuous infusion go Thursday . Patients receive second bolus infusion follow 4 day continuous infusion every week 5 week . Patients begin radiation therapy first bevacizumab doxorubicin infusion Monday ( exclude holiday ) . Radiation therapy deliver five day per week ( Monday Friday-excluding holiday ) period 6 week . This do outpatient procedure . Each 2-week period consider separate treatment cycle . Patients treated radiation therapy maximum 3 cycle ( 6 week ) . The following test procedures do study week 2 , 4 6 surgery : medical history , physical examination , performance status , blood test , urine test assessment side effect . Patients additional CT scan chest tumor surgery . An ECG repeat time . A surgeon evaluate tumor review radiologic study study treatment determine surgical removal possible . After patient complete study treatment radiation therapy bevacizumab , surgeon repeat evaluation tumor review radiologic study determine surgical removal still possible . Patients surgery 6-7 week finish radiation therapy . Patients additional radiation therapy research doctor think cancer cell may leave body area tumor remove . The radiation may give patient surgery two week surgery . This determine surgeon radiation oncologist . Patients research study 3 month . After last dose study drug investigator would like keep track medical condition 10 year . The investigator would like call patient telephone year see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help investigator look long term effect research study .</detailed_description>
