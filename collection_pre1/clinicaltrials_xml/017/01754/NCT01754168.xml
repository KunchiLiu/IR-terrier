	<detailed_description>Participants PD study initial visit assess clinical , cognitive , brain imaging . A one year , applicable , three year cognitive assessment do , entire/complete assessment ( initial visit ) repeat two year . There maximum three follow visit . The imaging test battery consist amyloid acetylcholine brain PET MRI scan . The use acetylcholine PET image demonstrate change activity neurotransmitter relate change cognitive function , memory mental concentration . A key question whether person PD lose acetylcholine brain cell also buildup Alzheimer amyloid protein rapid progression severe cognitive decline behavioral change compare person amyloid protein .</detailed_description>
