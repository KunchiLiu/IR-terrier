	<brief_title>Surveillance Study Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection ( RSV ) Subjects &lt; 24 Months Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There vaccine available prevent Respiratory Syncytial Virus disease ; however , humanize monoclonal antibody approve prevention Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection pediatric patient high risk disease ( eg , pre-term infant , congenital heart disease , chronic lung disease ) . Beyond high-risk group , infection common otherwise healthy infant severe , leading hospitalization uncommon , death . Each year United States , approximately 100,000 Respiratory Syncytial Virus-related hospitalization occur low risk infant . Currently , treatment infant suffer Respiratory Syncytial Virus disease limit supportive care goal maintain adequate oxygenation nutrition . The availability novel anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus therapeutic reduces number hospitalization related Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection would fulfill unmet medical need pediatric population . For maximum effect , treatment administer early possible course infection . Accordingly , opportunity early intervention anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus therapeutic outpatient setting , prior hospitalization . However , incidence Respiratory Syncytial Virus-related hospitalization , well natural history viral dynamic Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection , remain undefined outpatient setting . A good understanding prevalence Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection subsequent hospitalization rate among symptomatic infant well early disease course Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection help design clinical trial need assess efficacy anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus therapeutic develop Gilead Sciences .</detailed_description>
