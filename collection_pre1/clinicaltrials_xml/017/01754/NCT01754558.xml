	<brief_summary>During last decade numerous new procedure present regard surgical treatment urinary stress incontinence ( 1,2 ) . Development midurethral tape procedure ( TVT ) change surgical procedure dramatically regard extent surgical procedure also decrease morbidity remarkably . The success rate TVT procedure proven high ( 1,2 ) . However , development TOT/TVT-O procedure disclose new fixation point decrease risk bladder injury ( 1,2 ) . Since introduction trans-obturator sling several mini-slings introduce order reduce need perforation skin muscle ( 3,4,5 ) . Although system seem promise ( 5 ) others disclose long learn curve , pain problem follow procedure low success rate , compare traditional sling procedure . None mini-slings adjustable . Recently Ajust system treatment stress urinary incontinence introduce . The system single incision sling procedure consist adjustable Polypropylene mesh sling self fixation anchor ( 6 ) . In feasibility study ( 6 ) , 6 month objective cure rate 82 % , lack information regard adverse event durability treatment success . Our preliminary experience suggest , procedure rapid learn curve , low pain score postoperatively 94 % cure rate 3 month follow-up ( personal observation ) . Recently , several abstract indicate cure rate obtain Ajust comparable TVT TVT-O ( 10-12 ) . The purpose present study ( primary outcome ) : To test hypothesis Ajust TVT , TVT-O TOT , respectively equal regard subjective cure rate ( cure define subjectively incontinent ) , i.e . study design non-inferiority study . The study perform randomise control trial without blind . The study power detect 9 % difference two group . The subjective cure rate base ICIQ measurement Secondary outcome : - To test hypothesis Ajust associate significantly lower postoperative pain perception . - To test hypothesis antibiotic treatment necessary</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>One Year Outcome Using Ajust System Treatment Urinary Stress Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint : A cured patient define subjective symptom ( ICIQ-UI SF ICIQ-OAB ) objective detectable urinary leakage coughing ( 300cc bladder leakage cough ) Secondary outcome : Pain-perception evaluate VAS score daily first postoperative week , include assess need painkilling medication The endpoint regard use antibiotic base number urinary tract infection infection related vaginal closure first postoperative month . All patient evaluate postoperative physical examination urinary dipstick</detailed_description>
