	<brief_summary>Allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) treatment many malignant non-malignant hematologic disorder . Acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) serious life-threatening complication allo-HSCT . The outcome patient aGVHD poor overall survival low . Acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , major complication allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( PBSCT ) , limit application curative therapy . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) multipotent stem cell , able modulate immune response vitro vivo , possibility treat disease cause immune dysregulation aGVHD . MSCs obtain umbilical cord ( UC ) similar immunosuppressive property bone marrow-MSCs . In addition , UC-derived MSCs use off-the-shelf use obtain without harm donor bone marrow-MSCs . Therefore , investigator design study evaluate safety efficacy UC-derived MSCs patient aGVHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) class low immunogenicity mesoderm , self-renewal differentiation potential pluripotent stem cell . The umbilical cord one important source MSC . Human UC-MSC compare bone marrow-derived MSC follow advantage : ( 1 ) umbilical cord , `` waste '' give birth obtain without harm donor . ( 2 ) easy available , ethical issue . ( 3 ) likelihood contamination small protection placental barrier . ( 4 ) human UC-MSC strong amplification capacity , short double time , high colony form efficiency low immunogenicity . ( 5 ) avoids activity differentiation bone marrow-derived MSC latent donor disadvantage increase age decrease . human UC-MSC hematopoietic stem cell graft implantation amplification role promote exhibit immunomodulatory effect characteristic damage target site chronic inflammation . human UC-MSC prevention treatment graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) induce organ transplantation immune tolerance field broad application prospect . After 10 year exploration , investigator practitioner catch study find umbilical cord suitable mesenchymal stem cell seed cell relative bone marrow , umbilical cord easily obtain , ethical issue , good amplification ability vitro , viral contamination risk small , many advantage . Therefore , year , investigator team umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell lot basic work confirm mesenchymal stem cell derive umbilical cord safety effectiveness treatment acute graft versus host disease zoology test , successfully establish perfect umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell standard operating procedure ( include screen umbilical cord , large-scale preparation , quality inspection , preservation , recovery , transportation , infusion , etc. ) . The investigator carry clinical research base preliminary result .</detailed_description>
