	<brief_summary>Only 5 10 % patient infect HTLV-1 develop disease related infection . The two serious disease adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) Tropical spastic paraparesis /HTLV-I-associated myelopathy ( TSP / HAM ) . Factors influence development TSP / HAM individual HTLV-1 yet completely understood . Patients TSP / HAM HTLV-1 proviral load ( amount virus ) 6-10 time higher seropositive asymptomatic . Various study show development TSP / HAM subject HTLV-1 rapid evolution partly attribute failure immune system regulate viral replication expression . It recently show different version Single Nucleotide ( human leukocyte antigen ) rs12979860 , locate upstream gene Interleukin 28B ( IL28B ) , influenced severity infection hepatitis C effectiveness treatment . By analogy hepatitis C , Spanish ( Trevi√±o et al. , 2012 ) examine SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) 12 patient TSP / HAM 29 asymptomatic HIV-positive . CT TT genotype statistically frequent group TSP / HAM asymptomatic patient ( 80 % versus 20 % ) associate HTLV-1 proviral load high . We propose broad group patient population Afro-Caribbean , confirm result latter study conduct predominantly Latin American population .</brief_summary>
