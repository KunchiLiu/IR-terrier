	<brief_summary>The cardiotoxicity anthracyclines chemotherapy remain major problem , despite clinical echocardiographic monitoring . In case treatment breast cancer , surgery require general anesthesia may follow chemotherapy . Although possible interaction general anesthetic anthracyclines systolic function rarely mention , case heart failure / conduction disturbance peranesthésique observed patient treat previously treat anthracyclines . The determination concentration BNP diagnostic tool use detection heart failure acute coronary syndrome . The question possible synergism cardiotoxic anthracyclines anesthetic agent arise . Given minimally invasive nature diagnostic value , BNP assay might thus allow highlight possible subclinical deficiency .

Although possible interaction general anesthetic anthracyclines systolic function rarely mention , case heart failure / conduction disturbance peranesthésique observed patient treat previously treat anthracyclines . The determination concentration BNP diagnostic tool use detection heart failure acute coronary syndrome . In fact , one sensitive marker impair myocardial function , increase interest rate may precede biological change . In patient received anthracycline , although remains asymptomatic elevation NT-proBNP concentration may persist month exposure , , whatever dose receive . The question possible synergism cardiotoxic anthracyclines anesthetic agent arise . Given minimally invasive nature diagnostic value , BNP assay might thus allow highlight possible subclinical deficiency .
