	<brief_title>Open-label Study Effects Montelukast Patients With Chronic Cough</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic cough typically define cough persists longer 8 week common present symptom adult seek medical treatment ambulatory set . Prospective study show three condition account etiologic cause chronic cough large part immunocompetent , nonsmoking patient normal chest radiograph finding . In order frequency , upper airway cough syndrome ( UACS ) , previously refer postnasal drip syndrome ( PNDS ) , asthma gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . UACS comprise many different condition include PNDS , acute sinusitis , allergic rhinitis , non-allergic rhinitis ( postinfectious rhinitis , rhinitis medicamentosa , vasomotor rhinitis , rhinitis due physical chemical irritant ) . Cough occurs asthmatic , subset patient cough-variant asthma ( CVA ) , present symptom . In case well control inhaled corticosteroid beta-2 agonist . GERD another cause contemplate anti-tussive anti-inflammatory/anti-allergic treatment render result present symptoms suggestive . Moreover , factor like smoke use ACE-inhibitors also take account . Leukotrienes important agent inflammatory response . It know contribute significantly pathological process asthma . Montelukast leukotriene receptor antagonist block bond leukotrienes receptor thus inhibit inflammatory , bronchoconstrictive mucosecretory effect . Multiple clinical trial demonstrate ability leukotriene antagonist improve symptom , pulmonary function bronchial hyperresponsiveness patient asthma . However , much know effect people chronic cough . Studies carry attempt find effect montelukast form chronic cough . Nevertheless , impact montelukast objective parameter cough reflex threshold , explore . The investigator also reckon montelukast affect exhale breath temperature - novel surrogate marker airway inflammation recognize lately</detailed_description>
