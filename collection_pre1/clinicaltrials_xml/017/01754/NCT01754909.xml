	<brief_summary>This project test effect enalapril mitigate lung damage occur side effect radiation therapy lung cancer intrathoracic cancer . Thousands Veterans develop lung cancer every year , treat radiation therapy . Studies lung radiation injury laboratory animal show enalapril , investigator significantly reduce severity radiation injury lung . Enalapril FDA approve common use treatment hypertension , kidney disease , heart failure . These study advance work human use . Successful mitigation lung radiation damage improve quality life Veterans non-Veterans treat lung cancer radiation , may also improve cure rate radiation therapy lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To test benefit enalapril , angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitor , mitigate radiation pneumonitis fibrosis human . Subjects Men woman undergo radiation therapy lung cancer intrathoracic cancer Baltimore Milwaukee Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Hospital eligible . Subjects recruit phase 2 trial diagnosis cancer referral Radiation Oncology treatment . The existence study post Radiation Oncology clinic . Dr Cohen , Dr Beth Gore , Dr Michelle Mierzwa ( co-investigators ) study coordinator ensure recruitment . The informed consent process do Dr Cohen Gore Dr Mierzwa study coordinator . Subjects require radiation therapy attempt cure palliate disease eligible study . Subjects eligible surgical resection need radiation therapy eligible study . Subjects ACE inhibitor , angiotensin blocker , renin antagonist exclude . Use antihypertensives exclusion criterion . There inclusion exclusion race ethnic origin . Women minority eligible . Children eligible child develop lung cancer . Previous surgery past current use chemotherapy exclusion . Subjects Karnofsky performance status &gt; /=70 , absolute neutrophil &gt; 1000/mm^3 , platelet &gt; 75,000/mm^3 , hematocrit &gt; 25 % . Liver kidney function test within normal range baseline blood pressure systolic &gt; 110 mmHg sit . Pregnant nursing subject exclude fertile patient use contraception . Lung function test include spirometry , lung volume diffuse capacity obtain part standard care patient prior radiotherapy , index lung function test cause exclusion . The mean lung dose &gt; /= 18 Gy and/or V20 &gt; 20 % . Radiation deliver standard fractionation schedule 1.8 2 Gy per day , 5 day per week , without plan treatment break . Experimental design Radiation treatment start time 0 , give completion , indicate . Enalapril placebo start first radiation treatment fraction continue thereafter . The renin-angiotensin system test time 0 , three week , completion radiation treatment . CT scan do time 0 every three month thereafter first two year . Median survival expect 18 month . Subjects undergo therapeutic irradiation indicate clinical care . They enrol mask , phase 2 trial start radiation therapy ( RT ) , stratify cancer stage , randomize enalapril identical-appearing placebo . Randomization do Department Biostatistics , Medical College Wisconsin , use random number table ; center pharmacy notify assignment enalapril placebo . There stratification age , gender , lung cancer histology , use chemotherapy since consistent relation occurrence RP . Use enalapril placebo know patient physician time study . The medical center pharmacy stock provide study drug . Study drug , enalapril placebo , start first fraction RT , 2.5 mg mouth day increase 10 mg/day weekly increment tolerate . Routine clinical care course irradiation include weekly frequent clinical assessment vital sign . Blood test kidney function potassium occur within ten day start study drug . Additional patient visit occur study alone . Additional blood test occur usual clinical care also record . Routine care , independent study , include CT scan chest imaging every three month first two year follow-up . The study drug continue life . Endpoints injury The primary endpoint symptomatic grade 2 high radiation pneumonitis , define establish criterion , within first 4 month irradiation . The NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 use grade pulmonary toxicity . CTCAE worldwide standard report adverse event modality cancer clinical trial . Pneumonitis new-onset persistent cough require anti-tussive agent dyspnea effort unexplained pulmonary illness . It may last day week . Severe case may evolve respiratory failure . Use patient-reported symptom strongly recommend cancer-related clinical trial . Radiographic change RP occur half subject undergoing therapeutic thoracic irradiation ; radiographic RP secondary endpoint . Classic radiographic manifestation RP increase lung density within radiation field within first six month radiation therapy explain infection cancer . radiographic pneumonitis record two investigator ( Drs Gore Antonescu-Turcu , EG , AAT ) , use scale report Guckenberger . Investigators expect radiographic rate RP 50 % . Investigators expect almost surviving subject fibrosis CT scan 6 12 month , test another major endpoint . Radiation fibrosis lung evident scarring volume loss bronchiectasis within radiation field six month radiation therapy , explain infection cancer . radiographic fibrosis record quantify two investigator ( EG , AAT ) . Reduction diffusion capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) correlate pulmonary radiation fibrosis . DLCO obtain survivor 12 month time point , compare baseline value additional secondary endpoint . The occurrence clinical grade 2 high RP , radiographic RP fibrosis dichotomous variable , compare subject enalapril compare placebo . For RP , image show RP assign subject RP group . For fibrosis , last CT scan use . Investigators test quality life secondary endpoint . The Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy -lung ( FACT-L version 4 ) use assess Quality Life ( QoL ) . FACT-L contains four general ( physical , social/family , emotional , functional well ) one lung cancer specific subscale . QoL assess pretreatment , 12 month post treatment . Use patient-reported data strongly recommend cancer-related clinical trial . Aim 2 : To test mechanism mitigation enalapril Subjects These subject aim 1 . Experimental design Investigators test major component renin-angiotensin system ; angiotensinogen , plasma renin activity , angiotensin II ( ang II ) . These measured baseline , three week start irradiation , completion irradiation . Investigators test mechanistic involvement change use enalapril , particular whether benefit enalapril correlate effect lower plasma ang II level . Other component RAS , include angiotensin ( 1-7 ) , aldosterone , AcSDKP , bradykinin test experimental study show relevant mitigation normal tissue radiation injury . Baseline elevation one RAS component , compare known level normal population , may correlate development RP fibrosis control , placebo group . This may permit good focus use mitigators future , risk . Enalapril , inhibition ACE , reduce plasma ang II lead feedback elevation PRA . This confirm adherence drug therapy may also correlate benefit . Elevation PRA subject enalapril , without mitigation benefit , show ineffective , despite adequate bioavailability . Aim 3 : To confirm enalapril adversely affect cancer treatment outcome . Subjects These subject aim 1 . Experimental design Investigators compare cancer recurrence cancer-related survival subject enalapril versus placebo . Cancer recurrence assess clinically , confirm CT image histology . The RECIST criterion use . Recurrence rate survival assessed interim safety analysis study , finally completion . In statistical analysis , investigator account effect interim sample safety analysis , adjust patient disease characteristic well miss data . A benefit enalapril RP may enhance patient survival . An adverse effect enalapril survival stop study . But cohort 162 Veterans show difference patient survival ACE inhibitor compare ACE inhibitor . Thus , investigator expect adverse change recurrence rate patient survival . Expected result , potential problem , long-term impact Investigators expect subject enalapril significantly less clinical radiographic RP fibrosis , compare placebo . Investigators expect subject placebo develop RP fibrosis may baseline elevation AGT PRA compare n't develop RP fibrosis , mitigation benefit enalapril correlate effect increase PRA reduce plasma ang II level . Investigators expect enalapril increase cancer-related mortality , may even enhance overall patient survival mitigation radiation lung injury .</detailed_description>
