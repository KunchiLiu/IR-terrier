	<brief_summary>Spinal muscular atrophy genetically base disease affect motor neuron spinal cord lead muscle waste weakness . The gene find responsible underlying disease call SMN survival motor neuron gene . Individuals SMA either miss copy gene mutation gene . Although gene identify , actually cause motor neuron die lead muscle waste weakness completely understood . The investigator find skin cell child SMA tend susceptible cell death expose cell death induce agent . In protocol , The investigator wish study mechanism cell die expose agent may relate gene defect disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) neuromuscular disease characterize degeneration motor neuron progressive muscle atrophy . The disease one common genetic cause infant death . The gene responsible SMA , survival motor neuron ( SMN ) , exist human two nearly identical copy ( SMN1 SMN2 ) . Only deletion mutation ( ) telomeric copy gene ( SMN1 ) cause disease . The SMN protein know function assembly RNA splicing complex , however , mechanism ( ) SMN-deficiency cause cell death SMA clear . The long-term goal understand mechanism ( ) motor neuron death SMA develop mean prevention . SMN protein report survival promoting function culture cell . Preliminary study show skin fibroblast SMA patient sensitive certain death promote stimulus control fibroblasts . The investigator hypothesize SMN protein directly involve cell survival loss survival function SMA result motor neuron death SMA . The investigator use fibroblast SMA patient , fibroblast control without SMA , motor neuron-like cell line ( NSC-34 ) rodent primary motor neuron culture model system test hypothesis . The investigator determine effect expression SMN protein regulate cell death SMA fibroblast . The investigator investigate role SMN neuronal cell survival . Finally , investigator determine biological pathway ( ) SMN-mediated cell protection . Results propose study provide insight mechanism ( ) SMN protect cell death decrease SMN function lead SMA phenotype . Ultimately , obtain information could lead develop therapeutic strategy SMA .</detailed_description>
