	<brief_summary>This single-center , randomize , open-label , 3 parallel treatment study healthy adult subject assess relative bioavailability new formulation GSK1265744 LAP 400 mg intra muscular compare current GSK1265744 LAP 400 mg nanomilled formulation . This study evaluate LAP formulation GSK1265744 different particle size . Following 14 day lead period oral GSK1265744 , forty-five subject receive 400 mg one three GSK1265744 formulation vary particle size 200 nm 5 um intramuscular injection . Samples determination GSK1265744 concentration collect 12 week post-injection . Safety evaluate adverse event record laboratory value frequent interval throughout trial . A subgroup 12 subject receive 3 mg dose oral midazolam baseline Day-29 last day oral GSK1265744 lead period evaluate effect GSK1265744 CYP3A enzymes . The subject undergo follow-up evaluation minimum 12 week .</brief_summary>
