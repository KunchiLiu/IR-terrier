	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial investigational combination drug ( vemurafenib aldesleukin ) learn whether combination work treat specific cancer . While vemurafenib aldesleukin approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma , FDA yet approve combination vemurafenib aldesleukin . Researchers find large number melanoma cell mutation BRAF gene . It show vemurafenib block effect mutation BRAF gene , , result , may help prevent cancer growth . Aldesleukin , also refer IL-2 , immunotherapy drug administer via IV infusion increase growth key cell within immune system responsible target cancer cell . Activating key cell , call T-lymphocytes natural-killer cell , lead increase cancer cell death . The BRAF gene locate large pathway call MAPK pathway . Studies show BRAF inhibitor , like vemurafenib use block MAPK pathway , melanocyte , cancer cell express protein surface , make easy T-lymphocytes natural killer cell recognize kill . This suggest combine BRAF-targeted therapy aldesleukin , activate white blood cell , lead increase death cancer cell . In research study , investigator look see whether combination vemurafenib ( BRAF-inhibitor ) combine aldesleukin ( immunotherapy drug ) work together produce good health outcome people metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects take oral vemurafenib twice day 2 week . Following lead-in period , subject receive aldesleukin via IV infusion Day 15 study . One course aldesleukin 12 week long ; subject receive aldesleukin via IV infusion every 8 hour first five day . Subjects hospitalize 5 day receive aldesleukin . Week 1 aldesleukin day 15-19 ( M-F ) 12 week cycle . Following Week 1 therapy , subject discharge hospital take vemurafenib home follow week . Subjects come one week aldesleukin day 29-33 12 week cycle . This refer Week 2 aldesleukin . Subjects continue take vemurafenib twice daily course aldesleukin . Their cancer evaluate screen Week 12 follow begin first aldesleukin course CT scan . After first cycle , tumor evaluate every 8 week first year , every 12 week year 2 3 , every 6 month year 5 , annually thereafter . If scan show subject 's cancer improve first course aldesleukin , subject may allow continue second course . In event second course aldesleukin , subject remain vemurafenib throughout second course .</detailed_description>
