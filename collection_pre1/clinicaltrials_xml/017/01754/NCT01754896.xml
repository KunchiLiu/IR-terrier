	<brief_title>Pilot Evaluation Fecal Immunologic Test ( FIT ) Ontario</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2008 Ontario launch ColonCancerCheck ( CCC ) Program , organize colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen program average risk patient offer at-home screening test increase risk patient offer colonoscopy directly family physician . Currently , Ontario 's CCC Program utilize guaiac fecal occult blood testing ( gFOBT ) person average risk CRC . However , program currently consider change fecal immunochemical testing ( FIT ) . FIT , come quantitative qualitative format , superior gFOBT scientific perspective specifically detect human hemoglobin . gFOBT us indirect detection depend peroxidase reaction specific human hemoglobin . FIT methodology also convenient superior participant perspective multiple study demonstrate high participation rate improve detection CRC precursor well invasive CRCs FIT compare gFOBT . Organized CRC screen program consider quantitative FIT face certain additional challenge , include uncertain stability time tolerance variation temperature follow sample collection prior arrival test laboratory . Prior implementation FIT Ontario , need laboratory field assessment validate optimize use Ontario climate condition ( e.g. , large geographic area ) determine whether adjustment current structure CCC Program would require . This study consist 2 phase . Phase 1 , laboratory testing , assess 2 quantitative 3 qualitative FIT kit evaluate analytical performance relevant requirement CCC Program . Phase 2 field assessment evaluate effect different distribution return method pre-labeling kit uptake completion test . The entire study take 12-18 month complete , patient recruit family physician patient enrollment model ( PEM ) family practice across province Ontario . Data collection take place 6 month , start day screen kit and/or invitation letter mail patient . This Clinical Trials registration relate Phase 2 study .</detailed_description>
