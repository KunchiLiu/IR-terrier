	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA yet approve bortezomib treat prevent graft-versus-host disease . Bortezomib approve FDA treat human malignancy . Bortezomib drug anti-cancer effect involve inhibit cell growth cause cell death . This drug use research study , information tho research study suggest bortezomib may help low risk GVHD allogeneic stem cell transplantation patient match unrelated , unmatched relate unrelated donor research study . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation procedure select blood cell take sibling unrelated donor give . Lower dos chemotherapy drug give donor cell infused process know reduced-intensity conditioning . Stem cell transplant destroy cancer two way : The condition regimen destroy cancer cell teh immune cell donor recognize cancer cell kill . A common problem stem cell transplant graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . The word `` graft '' refers donor blood cell receive transplant . The word `` host '' refers person ( case , ) receive cell . GVHD complication transplantation donor graft attack damage tissue . GVHD cause skin rash , intestinal problem nausea , vomit diarrhea . GVHD may also damage liver cause hepatitis jaundice . GVHD may also increase risk infection . After stem cell transplant , patient receive prophylactic medication GVHD . In research study study safety effectiveness prevent GVHD use bortezomib treatment combination drug versus standard care prophylaxis ( tacrolimus + methotrexate ) . If take part study , 33 % chance receive one follow GVHD prevention treatment : - tacrolimus + methotrexate ( standard care GVHD prophylaxis ) - bortezomib + tacrolimus + methotrexate - bortezomib + sirolimus + tacrolimus Sirolimus , tacrolimus methotrexate drug suppress immune system try prevent GVHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Care vs. Bortezomib Graft-Versus Host Disease After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You undergo screen test procedure find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . Possible test include medical history , physical exam , laboratory test , pulmonary function test , cardiac ejection fraction pregnancy test . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Because one know study option best , `` randomize '' one study group ( describe ) . Randomization mean put group chance . It like flip coin . You equal chance place group . Before transplant receive conditioning therapy . The conditioning therapy study involve fludarabine busulfex . These drug give five , four , three two day transplant ( Days -5 -2 ) . Both chemotherapy drug commonly use allogeneic stem cell transplantation . On Day 0 , receive select blood cell take sibling unrelated donor . You receive 1 3 GVHD prophylaxis plan depend one randomize : - Arm A receive tacrolimus + methotrexate - Arm B receive bortezomib + tacrolimus + methotrexate - Arm C receive bortezomib + sirolimus + tacrolimus Tacrolimus ( Arm A , B C ) start three day transplant ( Day -3 ) . You give tacrolimus initially intravenously ( needle vein arm `` central line '' , catheter tube place large vein collarbone neck ) later mouth . You continue take tacrolimus 3 6 month transplant . Your physician discus tacrolimus dose . Methotrexate ( Arms A B ) give intravenously one , three , six eleven day transplant ( Days 1,3,6 11 ) . Bortezomib ( Arms B C ) give intravenously one , four seven day transplant ( Days 1,4 7 ) . Sirolimus ( Arm C ) start three day transplant ( Day -3 ) . You give sirolimus initially intravenously later mouth . You need continue take sirolimus 3 6 month transplant . Your physician discus sirolimus dose . To help engraftment , give drug G-CSF ( Neupogen ) start day transplant , white blood cell recover . You receive medication part standard care help prevent get infection . You also receive medication help prevent seizure condition therapy . Each week first four week 2,3,6 12 month follow transplant , physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . If take bortezomib , exam may ask fill additional questionnaire potential symptom numbness , tingle , weakness pain day 1,4 7 transplant . Each week first four week 12 month follow transplant , blood drawn ( approximately 6 teaspoon ) monitor progress health follow transplant . If receive methotrexate and/or bortezomib , additional blood draw day . Approximately 12 month follow transplant , needle insert hip bone small amount bone marrow cell sample bone remove .</detailed_description>
