	<brief_summary>This registry perform prospective surveillance participant attend collaborate Integrative Medicine clinic sit clinical service . All decision medication use , treatment , visit frequency , assessment tolerance , aspects patient management leave clinical provider ' discretion . We attempt follow participant PRIMIER Registry 2 year . Essential data element capture patient-reported outcome measure clinical activity obtain approximately 2-month interval first 6 month , every 6 month end year 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : According Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) , observational database provide opportunity simultaneous exploration impact integrative medicine various medical condition . As opposed select single condition patient may seek care site , project allow u collect prospective patient-reported outcome number frequently see medical condition . By cluster participant multiple IM clinical site medical condition , able compare impact various integrative therapy patient-reported outcome . Objectives : Primary Objective 1 . To evaluate change patient-reported outcome ( e.g . quality life , mood stress ) time Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate whether patient-reported outcome differ baseline characteristic participant ( e.g . demographic , clinical condition , intervention seek ) 2 . In subset clinic , collect cost data patient encounter allow cost comparison among intervention outcomes OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS Patient Reported Outcomes ( PROs ) The PRIMIER Registry use Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) online research management tool use collect PRO data . REDCap free , online research management tool enable researcher create study-specific Web sit capture participant data securely . Patient-Reported Outcomes ( PROs ) term use denote health data provide patient system reporting . A PRO basically patient 's feedback feeling function deal chronic disease condition . PROs also measure patient undergo treatment participate clinical trial . The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System ( PROMIS® ) , fund National Institutes Health , aim provide clinician researcher access efficient , valid , responsive self-reported measure health , include symptom , function well-being . PROMIS® instrument ( short form , computerized adaptive test ( CATs ) , profile ) central feature Assessment Center instrument library . PROMIS® unique PRO system four way : 1 . PROMIS® data comparable common measurement across domain 2 . PROMIS® measure reliable valid . They subject round rigorous review test ensure measurement precise , consistent , accurate . 3 . PROMIS® flexible : PRO tool measure obtain way in-person interview , write questionnaires computer-assisted tool . 4 . PROMIS® inclusive people regardless literacy , language , physical function life status use tool The PRIMIER Registry use PROMIS-29 core data PRO collection tool along Perceived Stress Scale-4 ( PSS-4 ) Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) . Cost Indicators In subset site , collect cost indicator healthcare resource utilization , include prescription medication , over-the-counter medication , physician ER visit , well measure patient functionality work productivity . This analysis use treatment utilization data obtain patient visit questionnaire data allow u count specific number treatment patient report course study . Patients ask report number type IM treatment session receive every data collection time point . In event patient skip interim study visit , ask report cumulative count IM treatment session receive since previous visit . We recognize patient may readily recall information , ensure accuracy measure , research coordinator ( research staff ) review patient ' medical record quantify type number visit participate integrative medicine clinical site study participation . Statistical Design Primary Analysis The main analysis PRIMIER Registry descriptive summary . Major Secondary Analyses Since PRIMIER Registry collect many variable 2 year period , secondary analysis include examine repeat variable change baseline . General Statistical Methods We summarize descriptive statistic use frequency ( percentage ) categorical variable . We report mean , standard deviation , median , quartile , minimum , maximum continuous variable . We use univariate analysis detect outlier subsequently submit query sit ensure clean data . Questionnaires aggregate score scored score use summarize . We perform repeated-measures analysis variance detect change PRO cost indicator time . We summarize result point estimate mean change outcome measure baseline specify follow-up visit 95 % confidence interval . We report P value overall model summary , indicate difference two give point . If P value significant ( &lt; 0.05 ) , perform follow-up linear regression analysis verify trend consistent direction throughout study visit , indicate constant improvement decline visit visit . Exploratory Analyses We look variables trend interest collaborate investigator explore . The appropriate analysis plan develop take advantage wealth data collect PRIMIER Registry . At time , know future analysis conduct . We know medical condition individual participant PRIMIER Registry seek help IM clinic , know advance IM intervention patient receive . With limitation , predefine subgroup statistical analysis present . However , future define post-hoc group clinical condition ( e.g. , participant cancer , chronic pain , headache , etc . ) IM intervention receive ( e.g. , acupuncture , meditation , massage , etc . ) analyse .</detailed_description>
