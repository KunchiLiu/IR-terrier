	<brief_summary>Lung cancer common malignancy associate cigarette smoking also affect individual never smoke . It well understood whether hereditary risk factor influence risk lung cancer . It recently find small number family inherit ( pass parent child ) change one gene may contribute increase tendency develop lung cancer , even never smoker . In lung cancer patient gene , call `` EGFR '' , contain DNA change know `` inherited EGFR mutation '' . Early data indicate inherit EGFR mutation may associate increase risk lung cancer . So far , small number family find carry inherit EGFR mutation . For reason risk lung cancer associate inherited EGFR mutation well understood . Understanding risk may help investigator find way detect lung cancer sooner reduce risk develop lung cancer . It recently discover lung cancer patient find carry one rare EGFR mutation cancer cell , call `` T790M '' , increase risk carrying inherit EGFR mutation normal cell well . This represent new strategy find individual family carry inherited EGFR mutation . This research study design find cancer patient whose tumor EGFR mutation , T790M , find also inherit EGFR mutation . Subjects undergo biopsy participate research study . Investigators collect saliva specimen patient T790M cancer find also inherit EGFR mutation . Study participant find know carry inherit EGFR mutation option offer close relative opportunity also participate study . Close relatives consider test see also carry inherited mutation normal cell . Once investigator identify individual relative carry inherit EGFR mutation gene , investigator try understand risk lung cancer cancer . Individuals inherit EGFR mutation also opportunity participate future study relate cancer diseases . This study fund part Conquer Cancer Foundation ASCO Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If subject lung cancer another cancer carry T790M mutation EGFR gene , he/she may eligible participate research study . To determine eligibility , subject need perform follow step : provide inform consent , fill study questionnaire provide medical record documentation . The study questionnaire take 30 minute complete . The questionnaire ask information personal family cancer health history . The information provide help investigator determine part study subject eligible . A week submit questionnaire , member research study team contact subject telephone clarify question response . For medical record documentation investigator request permission obtain review medical record pertain personal history cancer . Subjects need complete medical record release form allow investigator collect medical record regard prior cancer cancer treatment . After subject determine eligible , he/she conversation genetic counselor regard potential risk , benefit limitation genetic testing . A genetic counselor expert field inherit disorder . They work member health care team act patient advocate provide education support patient , family medical team . If subject agrees proceed , he/she provide kit ( mail person ) provide saliva sample genetic testing . This involve spit special container provide study . This sample send clinically-certified test laboratory determine presence inherit EGFR mutation . Once result determine , subject receive letter phone number genetic counselor call order review result genetic test . Alternatively , subject decide receive result genetic test note letter receive send back study team instead call result . If mutation find saliva sample , subject receive information undergo confirmatory test blood specimen . This do local laboratory use kit mail . When result available genetic counselor call discus . If confirmatory blood test confirms inherit mutation , subject receive instruction invite family member test appropriate . Investigators collect material prior tumor biopsy ( available ) , copy image scan , medical record study . The copy image scan allow study characteristic nodule lung . This information use answer additional question cancer carry EGFR T790M mutation . It take month complete main part study . After , subject follow every 6 month 2 year . If subject allow piece tumor specimen DNA store future investigational study , he/she remain enrol research long specimen store specimen bank .</detailed_description>
