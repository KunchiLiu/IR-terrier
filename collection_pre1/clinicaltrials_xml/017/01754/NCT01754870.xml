	<brief_summary>CLL/SLL incurable disease conventional chemotherapy , limited treatment option available patient become refractory fludarabine- alkylating-agent base regimen . Bendamustine recently FDA-approved agent significant activity CLL/SLL , include significant activity set fludarabine-refractory disease . However , duration remission follow bendamustine/rituximab combination therapy tend short patient heavily pre-treated disease already receive rituximab . The incorporation maintenance therapy overcome short remission duration population reasonable feasible option . In consider potential option treatment CLL/SLL maintenance strategy follow induction chemotherapy , lenalidomide rituximab appeal option base convenient dosing schedule recent evidence acceptable toxicity promise efficacy combination therapy .</brief_summary>
