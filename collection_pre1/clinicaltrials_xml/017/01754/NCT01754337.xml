	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . The main objective project compare efficacy single-hormone closed-loop strategy , dual-hormone closed-loop strategy pump therapy regulate glucose level 24-hours in-patient study standardize condition adult adolescent type 1 diabetes . The investigator hypothesize dual-hormone closed-loop strategy effective regulating glucose level adult adolescent type 1 diabetes compare single-hormone closed-loop strategy , turn effective conventional pump therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . We aim conduct 1st randomized three-way cross-over trial compare single hormone closed-loop strategy , dual-hormone closed-loop strategy conventional pump therapy . We aim compare three intervention 24 hour adults adolescent type 1 diabetes . Each 24 hour include 60-min exercise session , three meal characterize full day , activity mimick real-life condition overnight stay . This study also allow multiple comparison evaluate benefit component separately ( i.e . benefit merely close loop insulin alone vs. add glucagon closed-loop strategy ) .</detailed_description>
