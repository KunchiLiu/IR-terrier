	<brief_summary>The investigator propose treatment strategy patient treat induction chemoimmunotherapy consist rituximab + bendamustine 6 cycle , follow initiation maintenance rituximab lenalidomide among patient achieve objective response ( i.e. , least stable disease tumor shrinkage ) induction therapy . The goal maintenance therapy capitalize cytoreduction follow induction chemotherapy maintenance regimen also show promising activity CLL , order allow improve PFS population .</brief_summary>
