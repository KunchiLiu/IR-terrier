	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether iron therapy give iron-deficient Ugandan child moderate-to-severe anemia clinical malaria well absorbed incorporate red blood cell give concurrently antimalarial treatment Day 0 ( immediate group ) 4 week antimalarial treatment Day 28 ( delay group ) . Use iron stable isotope 57Fe 58Fe permit measurement red blood cell iron incorporation Day 0 Day 28 child . The investigator hypothesize red cell iron incorporation time initial supplement administration great child receive delay vs. immediate iron ( Aim 1 ) , child delay group also great hematological recovery Day 56 child immediate group ( Aim 2 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute v . Delayed Iron : Effect Red Cell Iron Incorporation Severe Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 1 million child &lt; 5 live sub-Saharan Africa die severe anemia annually . This severe anemia frequently result coexist iron deficiency malaria infection , standard care , concurrent iron therapy antimalarial treatment , proven ineffective cure profound anemia promote proliferation parasite study . The pro-inflammatory immune response mount malaria down-regulates iron absorption gut , make provision oral iron supplement malarial infection questionable utility . The present study proposes use iron stable isotope randomize design test whether start 4 week iron therapy immediately antimalarial treatment 4 week later associate great iron incorporation red blood cell time initial administration iron therapy improve long-term hematological recovery . One hundred severely anemic ( hemoglobin 5-9.9 g/dL ) Ugandan child 6-59 mos clinical sign malaria present Pediatric Acute Care Ward Mulago Hospital Kampala , Uganda , randomize start iron immediately antimalarial treatment Day 0 ( immediate group ) 4 week later Day 28 ( delay group ) . Children assess hospital Day 0 , Day 28 Day 56 receive bi-weekly home visit 56-day study duration . The specific aim correspond hypothesis propose study : Aim 1 : Identify sequence antimalarial treatment iron therapy result great red cell iron incorporation time initial iron supplement administration . The work hypothesis red cell iron incorporation great time initial supplement administration child start iron 4 week antimalarial treatment ( delay group ) compare child start iron concurrently antimalarial treatment ( immediate group ) , due complete parasite clearance resolution inflammation , permit well iron uptake , distribution , utilization . Aim 2 : Determine whether long-term hematological recovery impact immediate vs. delay iron . The work hypothesis delay iron treatment associate great hemoglobin improve iron status Day 56 compare immediate treatment due complete parasite clearance consequent improve iron absorption use delayed group . The result study establish physiologically-based framework optimal time antimalarial treatment iron therapy upon future intervention aim improve iron status malaria-endemic region build , thus help reduce morbidity mortality ensure full neurobehavioral development million severely anemic child suffer iron-deficiency malaria .</detailed_description>
