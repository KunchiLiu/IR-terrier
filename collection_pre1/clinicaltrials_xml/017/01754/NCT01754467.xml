	<brief_summary>Sedentary behavior associate increase risk mortality many health condition include type 2 diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease , metabolic syndrome , independent time spend moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity ( MVPA ) . Furthermore , independent total sedentary time MVPA , Healy et al . observed individual break sedentary time lower 2-h plasma glucose . Recent experimental finding also suggest break prolong bout sedentary behavior ( ≥ 20 minute ) either light moderate intensity activity 2 minute reduces postprandial glucose insulin responses.10 Replacing sedentary time light-intensity activity nonexercise activity thermogenesis ( NEAT ) may help reduce health consequence sedentary behavior . The purpose study develop smartphone application ( NEAT ! ) encourage sedentary adult diabetes increase break prolong bout sedentary behavior objectively measure accelerometer . NEAT ! refine modify technology create ENGAGED trial ( RC1DK087126 ) work conjunction Bluetooth enable accelerometer detect bouts sedentary behavior . When sedentary bout ( ≥ 20 minute ) detect , smartphone application trigger reminder prompt user encourage him/her participate NEAT least 2 minute . Following development , test , refine application , sample 10 sedentary adult type 2 diabetes recruit participate one month trial examine feasibility acceptability NEAT ! . To knowledge , first study design examine acceptability smartphone application target interrupt sedentary behavior NEAT use objectively measure sedentary time diabetic population .</brief_summary>
