	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Post-Menopausal Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . For select patient early stage breast cancer undergo wide local excision follow single fraction radiation therapy ( SFRT ) , evaluate rate observer-rated toxicity , cosmetic outcome patient satisfaction , objective measure toxicity quality life well delivery intend dose . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I. Locoregional control report five year . OUTLINE : Patients undergo wide local excision breast surgery SFRT 60-100 minute negative margin obtain . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
