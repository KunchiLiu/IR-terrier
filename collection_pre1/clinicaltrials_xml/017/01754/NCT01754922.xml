	<brief_summary>Following deployment Operations Enduring Iraqi Freedom Operation New Dawn ( OEF/OIF/OND ) , Veterans report breathe problem , difficulty exercise symptom . These symptom may relate deployment exposure , regional dust sand , smoke burn trash , local industry . Studies report poor air quality , little known effect exposure pollute air may Veterans ' short- long-term health . Investigators determine whether deployment-related exposure affect respiratory nervous system function Veterans - data may use guide rehabilitation . Ultimately , investigator ' long-term goal prevent development chronic respiratory condition group OEF/OIF/OND Veterans .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Deployment Exposures Cardiopulmonary Autonomic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence clear Veterans deploy Operations Enduring Iraqi Freedom Operation New Dawn ( OEF/OIF/OND ) expose high level particulate matter ( PM ) exceed environmental , occupational military exposure guideline . PM exposure acknowledge risk factor cardiovascular morbidity mortality , increase risk exacerbate airway disease . The reviewed epidemiology indicate high prevalence newly report respiratory symptom OEF/OIF/OND Veterans significantly affect deployment duty , include physical exertion capability . Despite retrospective data limit air sample report , prospective study lack . This pilot study evaluate cardiorespiratory autonomic function OEF/OIF/OND Veterans compare Veterans never deploy region . To evaluate cardiopulmonary function , Veteran undergo standardize exercise challenge bronchodilator spirometry . To evaluate autonomic nervous system function , investigator examine index heart rate variability cardiovascular reflex regulation ( e.g . baroreflex sensitivity cerebral autoregulation ) variety task . Data derive pilot project yield important insight extent severity cardiorespiratory and/or autonomic impairment - data may provide intervention point attenuate long-term adverse outcome pulmonary cardiovascular disease . Through early identification , treatment option ( e.g . exercise therapy , pharmaceutical ) may implement enhance physiological function , goal help alleviate symptom reduce chronic disease risk .</detailed_description>

Veterans assign Exposed group must deploy OEF/OIF minimum 90 consecutive day . The Control group consist Veterans never deploy Southwest Asia ( i.e . OEF/OIF , Persian Gulf War ) deploy time period . Each Veteran complete detailed exposure history questionnaire confirm support group assignment . Participants must meet contraindication exercise test describe joint statement American College Cardiology American Heart Association .
