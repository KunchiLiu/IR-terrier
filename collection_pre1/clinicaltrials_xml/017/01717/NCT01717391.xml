	<brief_summary>[ F-18 ] Fluorothymidine PET image use create radiation therapy treatment plan avoid active bone marrow pelvis . This do evaluate spar bone marrow help maintain blood count . This would impact chemotherapy administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>F-18 Fluorothymidine PET/CT Imaging Pelvic Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall survival pelvic cancer patient depend control systemic disease . If local radiation therapy deplete bone marrow function extent systemic therapy must withhold , chance metastatic failure increase significantly . This may significant group patient approximately one third adult bone marrow locate pelvic region . Strategies minimize toxicity would benefit range pelvic cancer patient include gynecologic , anal , rectal , prostate . New chemoradiation combination improve outcome disease site , come cost high level toxicity . As many 40 % cervical cancer patient miss least one chemotherapy cycle due hematologic toxicity 36 % anal cancer patient experience grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity undergo chemoradiation therapy . A clinical trial concurrent chemoradiation therapy rectal cancer terminate due toxicity , include hematologic toxicity . Concurrent chemoradiation therapy show promise advanced stage prostate cancer , also increase grade 3 4 toxicity . To successfully limit hematologic toxicity pelvic cancer , extremely advantageous avoid irradiate highly proliferative compartment pelvic bone marrow . However , complex structure pelvis make difficult assess efficacy radiation therapy ( RT ) planning strategy avoid area critical hematopoiesis . Uptake [ 18F ] fluorothymidine image positron emission tomography ( FLT PET/CT ) accurate sensitive tool identify monitoring effect chemoradiation proliferative pelvic bone marrow . Clinically validate utility FLT PET/CT image identify active bone marrow design bone marrow spar RT-plans important bone marrow assessment time point would provide method reduce acute chronic hematologic toxicity pelvic cancer patient .</detailed_description>
