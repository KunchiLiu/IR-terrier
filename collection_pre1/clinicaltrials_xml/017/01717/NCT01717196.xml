	<detailed_description>Background EUS-FNA central role diagnostic algorithm solid pancreatic mass [ ASGE Practice Committee ] high sensitivity specificity ( 75-92 % - 82-100 % ) , [ 1-2-3 ] low complication rate ( 1-2 % ) [ 4-5-6 ] . In clinical setting solid pancreatic mass histological diagnosis appear highly relevant differential diagnosis ( adenocarcinoma , lymphoma neuroendocrine tumour ) optimal therapeutic decision . For cythopathologic diagnosis pancreatic cancer , sensitivity increase operator 's experience reach 80 % 20 30 EUS-FNA . Furthermore well demonstrated on-site cytopathology interpretation procedure increase diagnostic yield EUS-FNA [ 7-8 ] . ROSE ( Rapid On -Site Evaluation ) may useful guide number FNA pass , learn part lesion may target increase diagnostic yield , correct technical error ( e. g. bloody paucicellular material ) [ 9 , 10 ] . The diagnostic yield EUS-guided biopsy depend size , location characteristic target tissue well technical procedural factor ( type needle , biopsy technique material processing ) [ 11-20 ] . Expertise train endosonographer interaction cytopathologist also important role [ 7-14-15 ] . Up three different size needle available collect cytological material : 25 - 22 19 gauge aspiration volume syringe 10ml . Most study EUS-FNA conduct use 22G needle . Data thinner ( 25G ) large ( 19G ) needle limit . A number recent study , include two RCTs , compare result obtain needle various diameter . All study perform set pancreatic mass [ 18-20 ] . Although thinner needle provide less cellular material large needle , specimens former less contaminated blood , thus easy interpret . In addition , thinner needle may easier use great flexibility , particularly location require important scope bend [ 18 , 19 ] . An RCT 131 patient find significant difference 22G 25G needle term diagnostic yield malignancy [ 17 ] . Finally another RCT compare EUS-FNA without ROSE use 19G 22G needle 117 patient [ 18 ] show similar diagnostic accuracy needle . If diameter needle use appear affect diagnostic accuracy FNA solid pancreatic lesion , preliminary study show use suction EUS FNA solid mass associate significantly high sensitivity cancer diagnosis ( 86 % vs. 67 % ; P=0.05 ) [ 20 ] . A pilot trial suggest apply continuous high pressure suction ( use balloon inflation device ) allow retrieval tissue sample histopathological examination case [ 21 ] . A new needle Expect Boston Scientific available aspiration syringe variable volume 5-10-15-20cc . No study perform compare diagnostic yield FNA solid pancreatic mass perform different aspiration volume ( 10 20ml ) without aspiration . Aims The aim prospective study compare EUS-FNA solid pancreatic mass perform 22 gauge needle aspiration volume syringe 10ml , 20ml without aspiration , look : sample adequacy , diagnostic accuracy , complication . Methods Patients This prospective clinical study four referral center EUS : ISMETT/UPMC ( Mediterranean Institute Transplantation Advanced Specialized Therapies/University Pittsburgh Medical Center Italy ) , Palermo ; AUSL Bologna , Bellaria-Maggiore Hospital ; Civico-A.R.N.A.S . Hospital , Palermo ; Humanitas IRCCS , Rozzano , Milano . We plan collect least 100 case 3 month . The study protocol conforms ethical guideline 1975 Declaration Helsinki ( 6th revision , 2008 ) reflect priori approval institution 's human research committee . The inclusion criterion study : diagnose suspect solid pancreatic lesion accord imaging ( CT-scan or/and MRI ) ; contraindication FNA ( see exclusion criterion ) . The exclusion criterion : age &lt; 18 year ; cystic pancreatic lesion ; history previous gastrectomy ; patient hemodynamically unstable severe coagulopathy ( international normalize ratio [ INR ] &gt; 1.5 platelet count &lt; 60.000 cells/cubic millimetre [ cmm3 ] ) ; patient unable suspend anticoagulant therapy ; pregnancy ; inability give inform consent ; refusal participate study . Data comorbidity chronic treatment record well data possible complication related procedure . Patients undergo anticoagulant antiaggregant therapy noncritical problem discontinue treatment least 5 day endoscopic procedure INR normalization , start low dose heparin . Written inform consent obtain patient procedure perform . All procedure perform conscious sedation meperidine ± midazolam deep sedation propofol accord center guideline patient clinical condition . Procedure Endoscopic ultrasonography perform use linear echo-endoscope five experienced echo-endoscopist current case volume list 500 per year ( 200 FNA ) . The standard technique FNA adopt : needle advance real-time EUS guidance target lesion use quick , strong thrust handle . The stylet completely withdrawn syringe attach end needle device . Once inside lesion , apply negative pressure suction open lock device syringe , needle move back forth 15 time EUS guidance . The suction syringe release , needle withdrawn catheter , whole system remove echoendoscope . The needle system case 22 gauge EUS-FNA ( Expect needle ) . After puncture stylet remove , perform three puncture 22 G needle volume aspiration 10 20 cc without syringe lesion . The sequence ( 10cc , 20cc , aspiration ) randomly assign seal envelope system . Technical success define puncture target tissue properly without technical difficulty ( inability needle exit channel scope ) mechanical rupture obtain visible tissue specimens fragment puncture . Tissue sample immediately smear slide puncture , fix prepared slide view experienced pathologist ROSE ( Rapid On Site Evaluation ) . For pas , smear sample slide , material fix formalin cyto histological evaluation . The cytopathologist always blind aspiration use specimen . The case stratify 4 diagnostic category apply ROSE histological evaluation : ) Positive malignancy , b ) Suspicious malignancy , c ) Negative malignancy , ) Non diagnostic . For aspiration two fundamental parameter evaluate slide formalin fix sample : sample adequacy intend overall cellularity ( include normal , neoplastic , non-epithelial cell ) diagnostic accuracy . Post-procedural follow-up After EUS-FNA patient monitor least six hour detect immediately post-procedural complication follow schedule protocol 30 day post-procedure order evaluate clinical status , blood chemistry , detect late complication . All patient follow least 1 month . All adverse event evaluate related procedure . All data record electronically excel database final analysis . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data analyze use SPSS 15 software package ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) . Continuous variable summarize mean ± SD , range , appropriate . Categorical variable summarize frequency percentage . For comparison qualitative variable , chi-squared test calculate . For comparison quantitative variable , Students test use . Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) , overall accuracy arm investigate . Differences consider significant P value &lt; 0.05 ( two-sided ) .</detailed_description>
