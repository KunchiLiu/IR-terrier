	<brief_title>A Study Assess Relative Bioavailability 4 Formulations Fentanyl Transdermal System Compared Against DUROGESIC Fentanyl Transdermal Patch After Single Application Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , 4-way crossover ( participant receive different intervention sequentially trial ) study . The study ass pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb body , distribute within body , remove body time ) relative bioavailability ( extent drug substance become available body ) 4 new formulation fentanyl transdermal patch , TDS-Concept 1 50 µg/h , TDS-Concept 2 50 µg/h , TDS-Concept 3 50 µg/h TDS-Concept 4 100 µg/h compare DUROGESIC fentanyl 50 µg/h healthy participant single application . All participant randomly assign 1 8 possible treatment sequence . During 4 single-application treatment period , transdermal patch worn , different application site lateral side upper arm , continuously 72 hour . The treatment period separate washout period ( period receive treatment ) least 8 14 day . The total study length 64 day maximum 82 day .</detailed_description>
