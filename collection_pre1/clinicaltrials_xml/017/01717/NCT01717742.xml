	<brief_summary>Bacterial pneumonia complicate development excess fluid pu ( pleural empyema ) around lung child . The incidence pleural empyema child increase significantly last 10 year . Short term morbidity condition substantial , unlike adult , long term outcome condition child develop country favourable . Inserting chest drain add medicine ( tissue plasminogen activator - tPA ) break organize pus show effective therapy reduce duration illness . However , treatment still suboptimal prolonged hospitalization common . Recent data adult suggest add additional medicine ( DNase ) decrease viscosity ( thickness ) fluid improve drainage lead well patient outcome ; however , publish study child . This multi-centre randomized control trial comparing time discharge hospital chest drain insertion previously well child present pleural empyema , treat intrapleural DNase tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) chest drain three dose 48 hour compare three dos 48 hour tPA alone . Other outcomes related effectiveness , safety cost assess well .</brief_summary>
