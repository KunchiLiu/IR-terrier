	<brief_summary>This study do help determine whether patient severe sepsis ( overwhelming inflammation body result infection ) lose muscle become weak rapidly patient severe illness . Weakness muscle loss develop severe illness serious problem . Patients develop weakness decrease muscle size often stay hospital longer high chance die . At current time , clear whether certain severe illness likely cause weakness muscle loss . This study do measure change muscle size strength result patient 's illness</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Atrophy Patients With Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An optional portion study available help determine move leg repeatedly mechanical device help prevent muscle loss weakness . In optional portion study , subject would CPM ( continuous passive motion ) device attach one subject 's leg intermittently next three day . Without effort subject , machine would move subject leg back forth ( flex hip knee ) repeatedly . This machine approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat patient knee replacement surgery help preserve range motion joint minimize risk damage joint intensive exercise . The use device study investigational .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A ) Inclusion Criteria 1 . Age â‰¥ 18 year 2 . Required mechanical ventilation least 24 hour B ) Exclusion Criteria 1 . Ventilator liberation anticipate next 24 hour . Rationale : short duration illness anticipate , prevent achievement primary endpoint 2 . Known suspected acute diagnosis neuromuscular disease cause diffuse low extremity weakness ( e.g . CVA , spinal cord injury lesion , Muscular dystrophy , Myasthenia Gravis , GBS ) . Rationale : chronic low extremity weakness impact anticipate physical recovery relevance atrophy observation 3 . Preexisting low extremity weakness cause prior injury , neuromuscular joint disease . Rationale : Inability participate usual care therapy CPM . Impacts functional recovery 4 . Wounds , dressing injury low extremity pelvis prevent muscle test CPM . Rationale : Inability participate US , exam CPM 5 . Patient 's family , physician , favor aggressive treatment patient include lifesustaining treatment presence advance directive indicating . Rationale : Unlikely survive seven day endpoint 6 . More seventytwo hour continuous mechanical ventilation previously hospitalization . Rationale : Atrophy mechanism already active may degrade ability detect early change . 7 . NonEnglish speaking subject legally authorize representative . Rationale : This study fund necessary translate consent inability ensure cooperation test . 8 . Subject and/or Legally authorize representative unavailable provide inform consent 9 . Subject Prisoner 10 . Pregnancy ( exclude CPM portion ) . Rationale : Pregnant patient develop supine hypotensive syndrome ( uterus compromise venous return due compression IVC ) . This typically occur 20 week gestation . To assure safety , patient self identifies pregnant positive urine pregnancy test admission offer CPM since require extend period supine position .</criteria>
