	<brief_summary>In September 2009 National Vaccination Council approve policy anti-HPV vaccination 9-year-old girl extend scheme 0 , 6 , 60 month , follow justification : - Antibody induction due vaccine great produce natural exposure virus - Immune response girl 9 11 year age similar response obtain three dos woman 16 26 year age - The third dose administer time maximum protection require , near onset sexual activity Thus National Institute Public Health commission monitor anti-HPV antibody level woman receive anti-HPV vaccine determine non-inferiority extend scheme 9-year-old girl compare traditional scheme 3 dos woman 18 24 year age . To end , sentinel cohort form evaluate immunogenicity level 3 age group , stratify vaccine type . The hypothesis 9-year-old girl administer amplified HPV vaccination scheme ( 0-6-60 ) show immunogenicity level lower adult woman administer traditional scheme ( 0-1/2-6 ) . The main objective monitor level immunity induce vaccination HPV two vaccination scheme quadrivalent vaccine : Traditional Extended ( 0-6-60 month ) traditional ( 0-2-6 ) ; Monitoring level immunity induce vaccination HPV three vaccine scheme bivalent vaccine : Extended ( 0-6-60 month ) , traditional ( 0-1-6 ) two dos ( 0- 6 ) ; well evaluate interchangeability bivalent quadrivalent vaccine third dose extended scheme . The study design create sentinel cohort woman vaccinate HPV follow comparison group : - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme three dos quadrivalent vaccine ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme two dos quadrivalent vaccine third dose bivalent ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year traditional vaccination scheme quadrivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-2-6 ) - Women 18 24 year traditional vaccination scheme quadrivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-2-6 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme three dos bivalent vaccine ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme two dos bivalent vaccine third tetravalent dose - Women nine year two vaccine dos scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-6 ) - Women nine year traditional vaccination scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-1-6 ) - Women 18 24 year traditional vaccination scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-1-6 ) - To monitor HPV infection , month 61 follow-up , group 400 woman age 14-15 year , vaccinate HPV , invite , order make monitoring occurrence HPV infection urine per month 61 , 72 , 96 120 post dose 0 vaccinate group</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Girls 9 10 year age administer amplified anti/HPV vaccination scheme ( 0-6-60 ) , show immunogenicity level HPV antibody lower 9-year-old girl adult woman administer traditional scheme ( 0-1/2-6 ) . The vaccination scheme HPV traditional ( 0-1 / 2-6 ) extend ( 0-6-60 ) , equivalent immunologically perspective therefore number memory B T lymphocytes well structure repertoire different scheme . Objectives The main objective monitor level immunity induce vaccination HPV two vaccination scheme quadrivalent vaccine : Traditional Extended ( 0-6-60 month ) traditional ( 0-2-6 ) ; Monitoring level immunity induce vaccination HPV three vaccine scheme bivalent vaccine : Extended ( 0-6-60 month ) , traditional ( 0-1-6 ) two dos ( 0- 6 ) ; well evaluate interchangeability bivalent quadrivalent vaccine third dose extended scheme . The study design create sentinel cohort woman vaccinate HPV follow comparison group : - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme three dos quadrivalent vaccine ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme two dos quadrivalent vaccine third dose bivalent ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year traditional vaccination scheme quadrivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-2-6 ) - Women 18 24 year traditional vaccination scheme quadrivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-2-6 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme three dos bivalent vaccine ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme two dos bivalent vaccine third tetravalent dose - Women nine year two vaccine dos scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-6 ) - Women nine year traditional vaccination scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-1-6 ) - Women 18 24 year traditional vaccination scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-1-6 ) - To monitor HPV infection , month 61 follow-up , group 400 woman age 14-15 year , vaccinate HPV , invite , order make monitoring occurrence HPV infection urine per month 61 , 72 , 96 120 post dose 0 vaccinate group Methodology Study design : Creating sentinel cohort woman vaccinate HPV three comparison group : - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme three dos quadrivalent vaccine ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme two dos quadrivalent vaccine third dose bivalent ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year traditional vaccination scheme quadrivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-2-6 ) - Women 18 24 year traditional vaccination scheme quadrivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-2-6 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme three dos bivalent vaccine ( 0-6-60 ) - Women nine year extend vaccination scheme two dos bivalent vaccine third tetravalent dose - Women nine year two vaccine dos scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-6 ) - Women nine year traditional vaccination scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-1-6 ) - Women 18 24 year traditional vaccination scheme bivalent HPV vaccine ( 0-1-6 ) Selecting study population . A fraction population female invite participate study proportionately , combine strategy school community . A total 2450 woman recruit . For study purpose , classify vaccine type administer , ( tetravalent bivalent ) , well age group vaccination scheme . Forming group evaluation . Two group participant form . Participants classify vaccine type receive : 1 . Bivalent Vaccine . This group consist total 2000 woman . Two third 9 10 year age , 500 18 24 year age . In first age group , 1000 administer vaccine amplify scheme 0 , 6 , 60 month . Five hundred female age group administer vaccine accord traditional scheme 0 , 1 , 6 month . All females 18 24 age group administer traditional scheme 0 , 1 , 6 month . 2 . Tetravalent Vaccine : A total 450 female participate . The 9 10 year age group include 300 woman , 18 24 year age group include 150 female . The vaccination scheme conform follow : In group 9- 10-year-olds , 150 administer vaccine amplify scheme 0 , 6 , 60 month , remain 150 receive vaccine traditional scheme 0 , 2 , 6 month . The group 18- 24-year-old woman conduct traditional scheme 0 , 2 6 month . The vaccination scheme assign accord number record and/or geographical location . For quantification immunological memory B T lymphocytes characterize lymphocyte B repertoire woman vaccinate HPV , 60 participant group , recruit medical evaluation month 60 . To evaluate interchangeability quadrivalent bivalent vaccine randomization perform group girl age 14-15 year assign begin project extend vaccination scheme ( 0-6-60 ) bivalent vaccine , one third group receive bivalent vaccine , another third receive quadrivalent vaccine remain third longer receive additional dos .</detailed_description>
