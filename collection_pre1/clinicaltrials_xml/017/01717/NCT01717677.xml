	<brief_title>Evaluation Four Treatment Modalities Prostate Cancer With Low `` Early Intermediate '' Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compare four possible therapy option treatment newly diagnose prostate cancer low `` early intermediate '' risk accord patient preference . The Following hypothesis test : - Radiation relevantly bad compare prostatectomy regard time prostate cancer-related death - Permanent seed implantation therapy inferior prostatectomy regard time prostate cancer-related death . - Active Surveillance lead significant decrease time prostate cancer-related death compare prostatectomy . That patient newly diagnose prostate cancer randomize one four treatment arm . Randomization may limit least two four treatment arm patient refuse one two four treatment arm accord preference .</detailed_description>
