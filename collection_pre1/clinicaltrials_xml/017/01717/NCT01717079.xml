	<brief_summary>Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) frequent , potentially life-threatening eat disorder characterize resistance maintain body weight minimally normal weight age height , intense fear weight gain `` fat '' even though underweight , loss menstrual period girl woman post-puberty disturbance experience body weight shape . Body weight shape dissatisfaction link development , maintenance relapse AN . Neuroimaging study show inferior parietal cortex involve body image perception less activated patient AN compare healthy subject . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) use modulate cortical excitability , particularly increase excitability high-frequency rTMS . The aim study investigate effect `` excitatory '' high-frequency rTMS `` hypoactive '' inferior parietal cortex 54 patient AN . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study compare effective rTMS ( 2000 ten-Hz stimulation per session , apply 90 % rest motor threshold , 10 session two week ) versus placebo rTMS . Assessments perform rTMS last rTMS session ( immediately , 15 day three month ) . The principal criterion judgement body image satisfaction scale ( Boby Shape Questionnaire , BSQ-34 ) . The secondary criterion judgement eat behaviour scale ( Eating Attitude Test , EAT-40 ; Bulimia test , BULIT Eating Disorders Inventory , EDI-2 ) , Hamilton depression rating scale Hamilton anxiety rating scale , quality life scale ( Short-Form Health Survey , SF-36 ) , body composition analysis use Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry alpha-MSH autoantibody level ( biomarker eat disorder recently describe ) . Inferior parietal cortex rTMS could improve body image perception , also help treatment eat disorder , allow weight gain decrease anxiety improve patient ' quality life . Also positive result could direct therapeutic implication possibility complete regular rTMS session , implant extradural electrode chronic parietal cortex stimulation .</brief_summary>
