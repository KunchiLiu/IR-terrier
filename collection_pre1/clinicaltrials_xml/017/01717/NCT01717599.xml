	<brief_summary>Pancreatitis one major complication ERCP . It show NSAIDs potent inhibitor phospholipase A2 , activity increase pancreatitis . The one study IM diclofenac show reduction post-ERCP pancreatitis without SOD ( sphincter Oddi dysfunction ) subgroup analysis small study population . Therefore investigator must need large scale randomize control study include SOD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intramuscular Diclofenac Prevention Post-ERCP Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study describe report approve ethic committee Yonsei University School Medicine , Seoul , Korea . Between July 2012 February 2013 , 380 patient fulfil inclusion criterion , 380 include final analysis . Consecutive patient recruit study present Yonsei University Medical Center variable symptom cause ERCP old 20years . Patients exclude study participation contraindication diclofenac , include patient recently diagnose peptic ulcer disease active/recent gastrointestinal hemorrhage within 4 week , renal failure ( Cr &gt; 1.4 ) , take NSAID precede week ( ASA 325 mg daily less acceptable ) , develop acute pancreatitis 2 week ERCP , history chronic calcific pancreatitis allergy aspirin NSAID , agree participate study . Additionally , state patient intrauterine pregnancy breast feed mother , exclude . Entry study restrict patient advise endoscopic retrograde cholangiography without pancreatography extrahepatic cholestasis and/or impair liver function test . The patient receive 90 mg IM diclofenac available hospital immediately ERCP recovery room . Patients observed recovery room least 90 minute procedure . Patients abdominal pain develop observation period admit hospital ( current inpatient , keep hospital ) . Decisions regard evaluation complication procedure in-hospital care leave discretion endoscopist clinical-service staff member , unaware study-group assignment . Patients discharge uneventful ERCP contact telephone within 5 day capture delay occurrence primary end point . Patient demographic , risk factor , ERCP procedural element , follow-up data record standardized data-collection form investigator coordinator unaware study-group assignment . The intramuscular route select basis available small size data suggest intramuscular NSAIDs effective prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis , perhaps owe rapid complete bioavailability oral administration . ( 1 ) At end procedure , researcher record detail maneuver perform , include total time procedure , number attempt cannulation , number pancreatic duct cannulation , final diagnosis , whether sphincterotomy , needle-knife papillotomy , stent placement perform . We use pancreatic duct stenting prevention pancreatitis . Patients sedate IV midazolam IV continuous infusion propofol monitor anesthesiologist whole time procedure . Xylocaine spray use local anesthetic . Serum amylase determine 4 hour ERCP . If 4-hours serum amylase level &lt; 3 time upper normal limit clinical evidence acute pancreatitis time , patient allow free oral fluid diet . If 4- hour serum amylase level &gt; 3 time upper normal limit patient exhibit pain nausea vomiting , patient keep fast IV crystalloid fluid opiate analgesic prescribe . The follow 24 hour blood test repeat serum amylase patient interview examined clinical evidence acute pancreatitis . Acute pancreatitis define serum amylase least three time upper limit normal range 24hours procedure associate new increase upper abdomen epigastric pain , back pain , epigastric tenderness hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization least 2 night . Patients persistent sign symptom pancreatitis 48 hour underwent contrast-enhanced compute tomography . Pancreatitis grade mild , moderate , severe . The severity determine accord consensus guideline , mild post-ERCP pancreatitis result hospitalization â‰¤3 day , moderate post-ERCP pancreatitis result hospitalization 4-10 day , severe post-ERCP pancreatitis result hospitalization &gt; 10 day , lead development pancreatic necrosis pseudocyst , require percutaneous surgical intervention . Sphincter Oddi dysfunction ( SOD ) define accord follow Classification . Biliary type I SOD define biliary-type abdominal pain , liver enzyme elevation , common bile duct dilation &gt; 9mm . Biliary type II SOD define biliary-type abdominal pain either abnormal liver enzymes dilate bile duct . Biliary type III SOD define biliary-type pain without objective finding . Pancreatic type I SOD define pancreatic-type pain dilate pancreatic duct elevate pancreatic enzyme , recurrent acute pancreatitis . Type II pancreatic SOD define pancreatic-type pain dilate pancreatic duct elevate pancreatic enzyme . Type III pancreatic SOD define pancreatic-type pain alone . The instrument use cannula , sphincterotome , guidewire , stone basket ( Olympus , Japan ) . Adverse event define report previously . Any case post-ERCP pancreatitis , complication procedure , adverse event potentially attributable study drug report local institutional review board data safety monitor board . These reportable adverse event gastrointestinal bleeding , perforation , infection , renal failure , allergic reaction , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , death .</detailed_description>
