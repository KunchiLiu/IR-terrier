	<brief_title>A Multicenter Phase I/II Trial Abiraterone Acetate + BEZ235 Metastatic , Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate Cancer Overview : Prostate cancer second common cancer men represent approximately 30 % cancer diagnose men . When confined prostate gland disease curable local therapy . However approximately 50 % men fail local therapy develop incurable metastatic disease . Androgen deprivation ( AD ) therapy remain mainstay treatment , advanced disease also adjuvant neo-adjuvant setting . Androgen deprivation therapy induce remission 80 90 % patient advanced disease result median progression-free survival 12 33 month , time androgen-independent phenotype usually emerge . This account median overall survival 23 37 month initiation androgen deprivation . Androgen deprivation achieve surgically orchiectomy , use form drug treatment . Current approach AD utilize leutinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists . These act continuous stimulation anterior pituitary result inhibition leutinizing hormone ( LH ) secretion , hence fall testicular production testosterone . Although AD clinically effective majority patient , study show extratesticular source testosterone represent important alternative source androgen stimulation significant proportion prostate cancer patient . As much 10 % baseline circulate testosterone remain castrate men , due peripheral conversion adrenal steroid testosterone . Increased level androgen receptor confer resistance antiandrogens prostate cancer xenograft model . This could result amplified signal output circulate low level adrenal androgen suggest role agent target adrenal androgen synthesis pathway . As prostate cancer progress castration-resistant prostate cancer genetic event accumulate . One consistent genetic finding CRPC amplification over-expression androgen receptor ( AR ) . Multiple group demonstrate up-regulation AR expression along de novo synthesis androgen adrenal and/or prostate cancer cell perhaps common mechanism prostate cancer cell progress despite castrate level circulate testosterone . This underlie biology likely mechanism explain recent success Abiraterone Acetate . An important genetic event find associate progression prostate cancer loss heterozygosity subsequent homozygous deletion 10q23 locus contain PTEN tumor suppressor gene . PTEN function , part , negative regulator phosphatidylinositol 3 ' ( PI3 ) kinase - AKT pathway . Targeting PI3K pathway and/or downstream target PI3K recognize important therapeutic strategy time . An important aspect PI3K signal PTEN mutation downstream event associate PI3K signal mutually exclusive aforementioned AR signal pathway aberrancy yield important therapeutic consequence . Preclinical data demonstrate PI3K inhibition upregulates AR expression , net effect antiproliferative concomitant anti androgen therapy synergistic . Introduction BEZ235 Abiraterone Acetate : Preclinical data demonstrate PI3K inhibition upregulates AR expression , concomitant anti-androgen therapy synergistic anti-tumor effect PI3K inhibition . This study seek enhance efficacy Abiraterone Acetate CRPC concomitantly target PI-3Kinase activity novel agent BEZ-235 . BEZ235 potent pan-class I PI3K mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor belong class imidazoquinoline derivative . BEZ235 investigational agent utilized study . Abiraterone Acetate consider standard care treatment Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) follow docetaxel , likely consider pre-chemotherapy setting base recent result . Despite benefit survival resistance therapy develop virtually patient . Study rationale purpose : It hypothesize signal PI3Kinase pathway major mechanism resistance Abiraterone Acetate therapy ( castration base therapy general ) inhibition pathway enhance clinical benefit Abiraterone Acetate . The addition BEZ 235 Abiraterone Acetate provide opportunity test inhibition PI3K along TORC1 attenuate survival mechanisms co-opted CRPC treat Abiraterone Acetate . We conduct Phase I study determine MTD combination use dose Phase II study . Biopsies metastatic disease prior treatment BEZ235 plus Abiraterone Acetate allow determination mutation PTEN and/or PI3kinase axis biopsied tumor associate response therapy combination BEZ235 Abiraterone Acetate . While PSA decline remain imperfect surrogate marker overall survival remain useful mean determine whether positive clinical `` signal '' exist give treatment strategy efficient mean determine approach could proceed definitive test accord standard Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) .</detailed_description>
