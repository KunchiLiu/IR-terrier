	<brief_title>Abiraterone , Radiotherapy Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Unfavorable Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm two-site study 37 men unfavorable prostate cancer ( define single high risk factor ) . Patients concurrently initiate 6 month standard-of-care GNRH agonist therapy daily abiraterone acetate/prednisone . After 2 month lead-in hormonal treatment , definitive standard-of-care prostate/seminal vesicle radiotherapy deliver , total dose 75-80 Gy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>One follow high risk criterion : Gleason Score 7 PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml clinical T12 , Gleason Score 810 , PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml clinical T12a , PSA 10.140 ng/ml GS &lt; 7 clinical T12 , Clinical T3 Gleason Score &lt; 7 PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml . ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1 Digital rectal exam within 90 day registration study CBC differential adequate bone marrow function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 , Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL Serum potassium ≥ 3.5 mEq/L Serum albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dl Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 1.5 X ULN Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min Age &gt; 18 year Able swallow whole tablet take abiraterone acetate empty stomach ( define food two hour one hour abiraterone acetate ingestion ) Ability understand sign write informed consent document Written authorization use release health research study information obtain Be willing/able adhere prohibition restriction specify protocol Subjects partner childbearing potential must willing use method birth control adequate barrier protection determine acceptable principal investigator study 1 week last dose abiraterone acetate . Bone , visceral soft tissue metastasis , include lymph node ( &gt; 2 cm long diameter ) Prior therapy prostate cancer [ Exceptions : LHRH agonist antagonist may initiate within 30 day prior enrollment . Bicalutamide may give within 60 day enrollment long stop least 7 day enrollment total duration longer 30 day . This allow enrollment give bicalutamide bridge LHRH agonist/antagonist . It highly unlikely short nonoverlapping course bicalutamide interact abiraterone acetate measurable way . Previous alphareductase inhibitor use allow IF patient take least 30 day prior abiraterone acetate initiation , OR alpha reductase inhibitor use primary treatment prostate cancer PSA alphareductase inhibitor remain within eligibility double . ] Known serum testosterone ≤ 150 ng/dl symptom hypogonadism ( fatigue , hot flash , hair loss , loss muscle mass , osteoporosis , low libido , depression ) prior ADT initiation explain medical comorbidity OR history testosterone supplement . If questionable , serum testosterone level great 150 ng/dl use exclude hypogonadism . Previous malignancy within 3 year nonmelanomatous skin cancer nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer Previous pelvic radiotherapy would prevent prostate/SV irradiation Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg diastolic BP ≥ 95 mmHg ) . Patients history hypertension allow provide blood pressure control antihypertensive therapy History gastrointestinal disorder may interfere absorption study drug ( include gastric bypass surgery ) Concurrent spironolactone use Significant concurrent medical condition would make prednisone/prednisolone use contraindicate would interfere patient 's ability participate trial Receiving investigational agent currently within 30 day prior study screen Prior demonstrated hypersensitivity , intolerance allergy abiraterone acetate , prednisone excipients Active comorbidity , define follow : Chronic liver disease cirrhosis ( ChildPugh B C ) active hepatitis B C History pituitary adrenal dysfunction Poorly control diabetes mellitus ( A1c &gt; 9 % history complication include peripheral neuropathy , end organ damage , hospitalization , amputation ) Poorly control glaucoma Clinically significant heart disease evidence myocardial infarction , arterial thrombotic event past 6 month , severe unstable angina , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IIIIV heart disease know cardiac ejection fraction measurement &lt; 50 % baseline . Clinical evidence active infection type , include active symptomatic viral hepatitis . Known immune deficiency and/or HIVpositive patient Any medical condition warrant longterm corticosteroid use excess study dose Patients take strong CYP3A4 inducer ( e.g. , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine , phenobarbital ) Any condition opinion Principal Investigator , would compromise wellbeing subject study prevent subject meeting performing study requirement</criteria>
