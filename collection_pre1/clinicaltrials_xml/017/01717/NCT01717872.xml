	<brief_summary>To compare laryngoscopy view use two standard clinical device , Macintosh Miller laryngoscopy blade , infant one day two year age . Miller blade ( straight blade ) commonly use MacIntosh blade ( curve ) pediatric clinical practice institution especially infant . The anatomy infant airway traditionally consider lend advantage Miller blade . Some argue Miller blade offer superior view laryngeal inlet lift epiglottis . However , others use Miller blade expose larynx without lift epiglottis , supposedly avoid traumatizing . Despite long-standing use blade , 50 year , systematic study ever compare laryngoscopy view Miller Macintosh blades infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Laryngoscopy View Using Miller Macintosh Laryngoscopy Blades Infants Under Two Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- After Institutional Review Board approval , patient meet inclusion criterion select Operating room elective surgical list . - They randomize one two group : # 1 Miller Macintosh blade . - After obtain informed consent parent legal guardian , monitor ( electrocardiogram , non-invasive blood pressure monitor pulse oximeter ) routine induction anesthesia apply anesthesia induce use inhalation technique sevoflurane , nitrous oxide oxygen . An intravenous cannula place . The child receive standard intubate dose muscle relaxant ( rocuronium 0.5-1 mg/kg ) . The lung mask ventilate use 100 % oxygen Sevoflurane 3 minute allow appropriate time muscle relaxant fully effective . At time , randomize code child open laryngoscopy perform either Miller MacIntosh blade indicated code . - The best possible glottic view obtain ensure follow step . The child 's head position Magill position , muscle relaxant administer , firm forward traction apply laryngoscope handle , need , external laryngeal manipulation apply . - During laryngoscopy , best glottic visualization obtain blade lift epiglottis lift epiglottis , random order ( flip coin ) . This difference matter move position blade back without remove blade larynx . - The two view record second doctor use SONY camera mouth adjacent laryngoscope handle . - Photos glottic opening grade use POGO scale ( Ref1 ) third ( blind ) anesthesiologist . - All intubation image acquisition perform Drs . Yuvesh Passi , Jerrold Lerman Chris Heard . - The image obtain patient identifier include . They store secure file study complete accessed investigator involve study . - No patient identifier include documentation apart source document . - The research data store locked office Dr. Lerman ( Room 251 ) Department Anesthesia , Women Children 's Hospital Buffalo study security protect subject privacy confidentiality . - There payment compensation study subject The primary hypothesis study compare view larynx Miller blade lift epiglottis Macintosh blade lift tongue , infant child &lt; 2 year age . However , view obtain Miller Macintosh blades lift lift epiglottis comparison pair measurement perform . In order detect superiority one technique , need difference POGO score 25 point standard deviation 25 point , yield sample size 15 child group . To account photographic difficulty , unreadable photo well dropout , enroll 25 child group . Therefore total 50 child enrol .</detailed_description>
