	<brief_summary>The burden malaria great child pregnant woman sub-Saharan Africa . Malaria one important infectious disease world . Uganda report among high transmission intensity world . Children pregnant woman vulnerable population . HIV also report high rate population . If malaria HIV require treatment time , high risk drug-drug interaction . This study : 1 . Determine use anti-HIV medication include lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , nevirapine ( NVP ) efavirenz ( EFV ) affect pharmacokinetic ( PK ) exposure antimalarial medication ( specifically artemether-lumefantrine , AL ) treatment uncomplicated malaria HIV-infected child pregnant woman , 2 . Evaluate impact age pregnancy PK exposure AL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design directly address antimalarial PK pharmacodynamics ( PD ) objectives child pregnant woman , population vulnerable malaria . This study focus pharmacology artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) , commonly prescribe anti-malarial drug sub-Saharan Africa inform specific dose guideline AL treatment uncomplicated malaria population . Traditionally , study focus non-pregnant adult , largely ignore effect childhood maturation pregnancy drug disposition . This gap research specify top priority WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network ( WWARN ) , emphasize importance proper PK PD study relevant population reduce threat ACT drug resistance treatment failure . This study allow optimization ACT regimens , especially set HIV co-infection inform use ART , specifically nucleoside analogue , set malaria ACT , goal reduce toxicity . This study complement ongoing PROMOTE trial provide valuable PK PD data leverage exist trial , greatly decrease research cost . This study involve co-enrollment HIV-infected child pregnant woman already enrol PROMOTE investigate PI- v NNRTI-based ART treatment strategy reduce malaria-related morbidity HIV malaria co-infected child pregnant woman . PROMOTE trial design collaboration Ugandan health care expert official result expect rapidly impact Ugandan health policy . This study build knowledge gain PROMOTE . The study also permit enrollment HIV infect child pregnant woman PROMOTE manage TDH referral site Tororo area . Lastly study enroll HIV uninfected child , pregnant woman non-pregnant adult . This study utilize state-of-the-art PK design drug assay method rely combination intensive population model optimize PK/PD analysis . Intensive study use serial sample relatively small number subject address focus question PK exposure population study use less frequent sample large number subject study relationship PK exposure , clinical response ( treatment failure , new infection , placental malaria ) , toxicity ( neutropenia ) consider multiple potential covariates . This study include development utilization small volume assay method ACT ART optimize PK/PD study child pregnant woman useful tool future research trial resource limited setting . Rationale study summarize : - Dosing guideline child pregnant woman rely study carry non-pregnant adult - Children pregnant woman exhibit distinct physiological characteristic impact drug handle body thus likely treat improperly - This gap research deem area high priority WWARN • Improper dosing may compromise care acute infection importantly contribute develop resistance - ACT therapy must protect factor contribute resistance - Drug-drug interaction anti-malarial treatment ART must evaluate assure optimize dosing . - Drug toxicity , particular neutropenia , set HIV-malaria co-infection may due important drug-drug interaction - Intensive PK design result determination precise area concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) permit robust comparison result inform treatment guideline policy HIV-infected child pregnant woman . - Once optimize dosing determine , PK new dose confirm follow-up ( F/U ) study - We need state art analytical tool quantitate key drug small volume sample collect vulnerable population include young child</detailed_description>
