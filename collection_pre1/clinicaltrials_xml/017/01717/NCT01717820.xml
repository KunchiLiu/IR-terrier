Each group 20 participant . One group receive grape powder supplement second group receive placebo . Participants undergo dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan ( model DPX-IQ , Lunar Prodigy Advance , PA +302666 , GE Medical Systems Pewaukee , WI ) Institute Women 's Health biochemistry lab ( HDB 017 ) . A researcher measure total bone mineral density , percentages fat lean body mass regional value android gynoid region . Participants wear street clothing free metal plastic . While undergo DXA scan , participant remain # 10 ) motionless supine position . The personal data 's body composition measurement collect PI . Blood Draw Participants ask provide fast blood sample begin research period . Twenty five mLs blood obtain Institute Women 's Health biochemistry lab ( HDB 017 ) phlebotomist , insert needle vein participant 's arm . The blood collect small tube serum freeze later analysis . Grape Placebo Powder Supplement One group ( treatment group ) 20 participant receive grape powder ( GP ) supplement group ( placebo control group ) 20 participant receive placebo powder ( P ) supplement .
