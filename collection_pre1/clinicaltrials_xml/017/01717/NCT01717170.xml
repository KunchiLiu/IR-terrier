	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 ; Able give inform consent attend study visit ; Have diagnosis uveitis determine Investigator noninfectious ; Have active uveitis , define least 1+ Vitreous Haze ( SUN scale ) study eye . As mentioned , least 12 randomized subject must also vitreous haze ≥ 2+ vitreous haze . : receiving treatment ; , receive prednisone ≥10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) and/or least 1 systemic immunosuppressant ; Have posterior , intermediate , panuveitis ; panuveitis , anterior component present , must less posterior component ; Sufficient inflammation require systemic treatment longterm regional treatment . Patients investigator feel may need shortterm topical therapy enrol . Bestcorrected EARLY TREATMENT DIABETIC RETINOPATHY STUDY ( ETDRS ) visual acuity 20/20 20/400 ( approximately 80 20 letter ) study eye ; Best correct ETDRS visual acuity 20/400 good fellow eye ( approximately 20 letter ) . Must chest radiograph within 3 month prior enrollment evidence malignancy , infection fibrosis . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screening . In addition , sexually active female childbearing potential must agree use TWO follow adequate form contraception study medication : oral , injectable , implantable hormonal contraceptive ; tubal ligation ; intrauterine device ; barrier contraceptive spermicide ; vasectomized partner . Males must agree use barrier contraception ( latex condom ) engage sexual activity study medication 28 day take last dose study medication . Subjects document history noninfectious intermediate , anterior intermediate , posterior , panuveitis include restrict : intermediate uveitis , sarcoidosis , VogtKoyanagiHarada ( VKH ) syndrome , birdshot retinochoroidopathy , retinal vasculitis , sympathetic ophthalmia , multifocal choroiditis panuveitis . Prior study screening , potential subject must evaluate screen infectious etiology investigator , possibly part standard clinical acre ; test rule infectious cause must perform within 3 month screen STOPUVEITIS study . Currently active uncontrolled uveitis ( type mention ) determination investigator , require initiation corticosteroid monotherapy dose ≥ 10 mg/day ( equivalent ) prednisone therapy immunomodulatory therapy injection corticosteroid ( intravitreal periocular ) ; uveitis subject oral corticosteroid contraindicate , relatively absolutely . Evidence active noninfectious ocular inflammation , determination investigator , require therapy ( e.g . vitreous cell , vitreous haze , retinal vasculitis , chorioretinitis ) . Such evidence document clinical examination , photography , ancillary testing ( e.g . fluorescein angiography , indocyanine green ( ICG ) , optical coherence tomography ) . As long investigator determines degree inflammation monitor regression progression , inflammation criterion meet . Not plan undergo elective ocular surgery first 6 month study . Any significant ocular disease could compromise vision study eye . These include , limited : Diabetic retinopathy : proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) compromise vision . Agerelated macular degeneration ; Myopic degeneration active subfoveal choroidal neovascularization . Advanced glaucoma status post trabeculectomy tube/valve placement Any follow treatment within 90 day prior Day 0 anticipate use follow treatment study eye : Intravitreal injection ( include limited steroid antivascular endothelial growth factor ) ; Posterior subtenon 's steroid Intraocular surgery within 90 day prior Day 0 study eye ; Capsulotomy within 30 day prior Day 0 study eye ; History vitreoretinal surgery scleral buckle Any ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction capsulotomy ) study eye anticipate within first 180 day follow Day 0 ; Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) ≥25 mmHg study eye ( glaucoma patient maintain 2 topical medication IOP &lt; 25 mmHg allow participate ) ; Pupillary dilation inadequate quality stereoscopic fundus photography study eye ; Media opacity would limit clinical visualization ; Presence form ocular malignancy study eye , include choroidal melanoma ; History herpetic infection study eye adnexa ; Presence know active inactive toxoplasmosis either eye ; Ocular periocular infection either eye ; Participation investigational drug device clinical trial within 30 day prior Day 0 , plan participate investigational drug device clinical trial within 180 day follow Day 0 . This include ocular nonocular clinical trial Major surgery ( include joint surgery ) within 8 week prior screen plan major surgery within 6 month follow randomization Prior treatment celldepleting therapy , include investigational agent approve therapy , example CAMPATH , antiCD4 , antiCD5 , anti¬CD3 , antiCD19 antiCD20 Treatment intravenous gamma globulin , plasmapheresis Prosorba column within 6 month baseline Immunization live/attenuated vaccine within 4 week prior baseline Previous treatment tocilizumab ( TCZ ) Any previous treatment alkylating agent chlorambucil , total lymphoid irradiation History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction human , humanized murine monoclonal antibody Evidence serious uncontrolled concomitant cardiovascular , nervous system , pulmonary ( include obstructive pulmonary disease ) , renal , hepatic , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ) gastrointestinal disease ( include complicate diverticulitis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn‟s disease ) Current liver disease determine principal investigator unless related primary disease investigation Known active current history recurrent bacterial , viral , fungal , mycobacterial infection ( include limit tuberculosis atypical mycobacterial disease , Hepatitis B C , herpes zoster , exclude fungal infection nail bed ) Any major episode infection require hospitalization treatment IV antibiotic within 4 week screen oral antibiotic within 2 week prior screen Active tuberculosis ( TB ) require treatment within previous 3 year . Patients screen latent TB , positive , treat follow local practice guideline prior initiate ( Tocilizumab ) TCZ . Patients treat tuberculosis recurrence 3 year permit Primary secondary immunodeficiency ( history currently active ) Evidence active malignant disease , malignancy diagnose within previous 5 year ( include hematological malignancy solid tumor , except basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix uterus excise cure ) Pregnant woman nurse ( breast feeding ) mother Patients reproductive potential willing use effective method contraception History alcohol , drug chemical abuse within 1 year prior screen . Neuropathies condition might interfere pain evaluation unless related primary disease investigation Patients lack peripheral venous access Serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL ( 141 μmol/L ) female patient &gt; 1.9 mg/dL ( 168 μmol/L ) male patient .
