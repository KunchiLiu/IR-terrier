	<brief_title>Thromboembolic Complications After Pacemaker Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 235.500 cardiac pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillators implant US every year , estimate 25,000 new implant Brazil . Despite proven clinical effectiveness efficacy number clinical condition arrhythmias , number adverse event post-implant period remain substantial . Among complication , venous obstruction occur anywhere 14 % 64 % patient , cause devastate consequence upper extremity deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism , ultimately lead either significant impairment death . Although retrospective study demonstrate high incidence complication , consequence paucity reliable registry know next nothing regard venous lesion may influence clinical outcome mortality patient , whether laboratorial marker may contribute early diagnosis venous thrombosis complication , property diagnostic image identification thromboembolic complication permanent transvenous lead implantation . The objective study therefore propose significant improvement exist clinical database locate within Heart Institute ( INCOR ) University Sao Paulo enable provision answer clinical , biomarker , imaging-related research question . Specifically , aim : - Aim 1 - Registry infrastructure : In collaboration professor Duke University , create series improvement current database enable serve platform current study also future longitudinal , randomized study . These include standardization variable accordance international guideline , increase patient retention ability additional data point in-between clinical appointment , improvement determination cause mortality , data quality monitoring , creation item bank measure aspects quality life specific population , well integration image biomarkers clinical database . - Aim 2 - Diagnostic imaging method : To identify incidence upper extremity deep venous thrombosis cardiac device implantation reoperation procedure , well , incidence symptomatic asymptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism . - Aim 3 - Prognostic clinical factor : To study impact thromboembolic complication clinical prognostic mortality patient ; - Aim 4 - Prognostic biomarkers : To determine association biomarkers related alteration hemostasis system occurrence venous thrombosis ( biomarkers : Fibrinogen , D Dimer , Antithrombin , Prothrombin fragment 1 +2 , thromboxane B , Platelets , Plasminogen ) At end study registry one large number patient condition around world , fully equip future randomize controlled trial . We also much well understand regard clinical , image , biomarkers condition .</detailed_description>
