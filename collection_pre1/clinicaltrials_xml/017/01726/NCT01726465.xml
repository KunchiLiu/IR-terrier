	<brief_summary>This prospective double-blind randomize phase II clinical trial , two group intervention ( one administration N-acetylcysteine administration methylprednisolone ) , one group placebo . The purpose study investigate role N-acetylcysteine Methylprednisolone modulation warm ischemia liver hepatic resection . In fact avoid massive blood loss liver surgery , continuous intermittent vascular clamp hepatic hilum ( 'Pringle maneuver ' ) generally use good result . However , consequence , ischemia subsequent reperfusion result complex metabolic , immunological , microvascular change , together might contribute hepatocellular damage dysfunction . This phenomenon , know ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury liver , complex multi-path process lead activation inflammatory pathway . Any patient candidate liver resection enrol study base aforementioned criterion . The primary objective study assess real efficacy Methylprednisolone N-acetylcysteine reduce secondary damage ischemia reperfusion injury liver resection reduce inflammatory response . Secondary objective study whether reduction ischemia-reperfusion injury result : low incidence postoperative liver failure , improvement postoperative liver function , reduction blood component transfusion . The randomization do day operation . The drug prepare blind fashion hospital pharmacy . The hospital pharmacy provide patient drip make bolus hour start liver resection syringe pump infusion approximately 6 hour . If patient enrol randomized placebo arm , he/she receive 250 ml glucose 5 % plus infusion 100 ml glucose 5 % If patient randomize Methylprednisolone arm , he/she receive dose 500 mg 250 ml glucose 5 % plus 100 mg glucose 5 % . If patient randomize N-acetylcysteine arm , he/she receive dose 150 mg/kg 250 ml glucose 5 % plus N-acetylcysteine 50 mg/kg 100 ml glucose 5 % . Systematic sample liver function test do day operation , end operation , well postoperative day 1 , 3 , 5 7 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Elective liver resection perform mainly benign malignant liver tumor . The malignant tumor may arise primarily within liver ( hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma ) represent metastasis malignancy organ . During hepatic resection , risk severe intraoperative bleeding represent major risk . To avoid massive blood loss , continuous intermittent vascular clamp hepatic artery portal vein ( 'Pringle maneuver ' ) efficient method reduce hemorrhage . However , consequence , ischemia subsequent reperfusion result complex metabolic , immunological , microvascular change , together might contribute hepatocellular damage dysfunction . This phenomenon , know ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury liver , complex multi-path process lead activation inflammatory pathway , cellular injury result event occur ischemic reperfusion phase . The key mechanism tissue injury intense excessive inflammatory response reperfusion . Although initially consider condition mediate innate immune response , IR injury also trigger adaptive immunity , activate Kupffer cell express cytokine chemokines thereby lead neutrophil activation recruitment . Neutrophils inflict tissue damage liver generation reactive oxygen-species ( ROS ) proteolytic enzyme . Various method many pharmacological agent attempt decrease IR injury associate prolonged duration vascular occlusion , one standard care protocols liver resection . After tough review literature consider promising data two drug : N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) Methylprednisolone ( MET ) . NAC seem active ischemic phase early reperfusion period . In fact blood flow interrupt cellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) deplete buildup adenosine monophosphate , catabolize hypoxanthine oxidize xanthine enzyme xanthine oxidase , generate ROS process . Glutathione ( GSH ) , antioxidant present liver , offer protection oxygen free radical . During hypoxia , GSH store consume , predisposes oxidative injury . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) serve precursor GSH replenish intracellular GSH store , directly scavenge hydrogen peroxide . It also show impair chemo taxi generation oxygen radical human phagocytic cell anti-inflammatory action , inhibit cytokine-mediated induction nitric oxide synthase human hepatocytes vitro probably anti-inflammatory mechanism hepatoprotection oxidative injury nitric oxide ( NO ) . So substantial body experimental work evaluate role NAC liver I/R injury , study small term patient , importantly utilize widely disparate range protocol administration . Yet , one small study describe outcome randomize control trial patient undergo liver resection . Thus , decide , ' priori ' sample power calculation , investigate effect NAC patient submit hepatic resection systematically perform 'Pringle maneuver ' use load dose subsequent infusion Randomized Clinical Trial liver transplantation . Together NAC decide investigate effect MET , glucocorticoid steroid act anti-inflammatory agent , reduce inflammatory marker apoptotic cell count experimental liver IR injury . To knowledge , three publish study evaluate role MET liver resection , one associate significant decrease transaminase enzyme ( AST ALT ) . The basic hypothesis protective effect Methylprednisolone may become apparent extent liver resection and/or duration vascular occlusion increase . Therefore , investigator design randomize control trial adequate sample size aim recognize intervention group , one NAC one MET , statistically significant reduction ALT AST ( 100U/L ) compare placebo group . No stratification plan . Two comparison plan Experimental ( MET+NAC ) vs. Standard MET vs. NAC . A randomization ratio MET : NAC : STD=1:1:1 plan ; Experimental ( EXP ) Vs Standard ( STD ) comparison allocation ratio therefore 2:1 . In order verify superiority EXP ( MET+NAC ) assume standard treatment mean value ALT 800 unit standard deviation ( SD ) 100 , report literature . investigator decide consider interest reduction 100 experimental treatment lead consider value 700 desirable . Considering α value 0.025 ( one-sided ) power 90 % , total 48 evaluable patient require ( 16 arm ) . If test result statistical significant advantage EXP arm ( MET+NAC ) , study continue accrual MET NAC , aim compare MET vs. NAC , consider difference interest 50 unit , α value 0.05 ( two-sided ) power 80 % . Further 94 Pts need enrol total 126 evaluable patient available comparison MET vs. NAC . The total sample size 142 ( 63 treat MET , 63 treat NAC 16 treat standard therapy ) .</detailed_description>
