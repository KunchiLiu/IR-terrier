	<brief_summary>To elucidate Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) treatment IBS . An SCS system 4-polar electrode T5-8 level implant . In randomized , cross-over study design , active stimulation compare period without stimulation , ensue tail stimulation period , twice long . Patients recorded average pain level , pain attack , number diarrhea global quality life . At end study patient choose retain SCS stimulation system remove . The outcome present trial show whether SCS useful treatment IBS . The long-term follow-up show continuous amelioration SCS least six month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim study investigate typical chronic abdominal pain IBS ameliorate SCS . Secondary aim possible effect SCS diarrhea constipation , quality life side effect , evaluate feasibility tolerability SCS validate willingness patient retain SCS stimulation equipment . Eligible patient select gastroenterologist study inclusion criterion : age 18-60 , fulfilment Rome II criterion , abdominal pain episodically reach &gt; 4 0-10 VAS , stable symptom past 2 year . A thorough clinical work-up do exclude organic disease , include routine blood electrolyte status , hepatic enzyme function lactose tolerance test well colonoscopy colon x-ray . Patients significant somatic psychiatric co-morbidity exclude . Study design : A quadripolar SCS-lead ( Quad-plus® , Medtronic Inc. , Minnesota , USA ) implant via percutaneous puncture Th11/12 level dorsal epidural space local anesthesia patient prone position . The electrode advance mid-thoracic level , aim final position around T6-T8 , intraoperative stimulation yield paresthesias cover abdomen . The electrode connect impulse generator ( Itrel-3® , Medtronic Inc. ) implant subcutaneously upper leave quadrant abdomen . Stimulation frequency set 50 Hz patient parameter ( electrode pole combination , amplitude pulse width ) adjust set produce adequate paresthesia comfortable intensity . During subsequent ongoing trial reprogramming allow , necessary optimal stimulation . SCS start 2 week surgery . Thereafter patient randomize either two study arm : one start SCS period six week ( A ) , another six week without SCS ( delayed start ) ( B ) . When active SCS , patient prompt stimulate 8-12 h per day . Patients instructed increase stimulation upon pain attack break-through . After six week , patient without stimulation crossed-over stimulation vice versa . After another six week study arm include continued stimulation additional 12 week 26 week . After final 2-week period without stimulation trial terminate . During whole study period patient record , daily basis : 1 ) number pain attack , 2 ) number diarrhea episode , 3 ) average pain level day ( 0-10 ) 4 ) average quality life ( 0-10 ) . Patients schedule regular control , 2 , 8 , 14 , 26 28 week implantation . Patient compliance ensure , impulse generator store information percentage elapse time stimulation use . At termination study participant offer keep implant SCS system remove . All patient contact structure telephone interview follow-up time-point vary 18 78 month study termination . A questionnaire use assess present pain level , medication , use SCS system , side effect global satisfaction . Patients also ask whether would participate know outcome advance , would recommend trial SCS treatment someone else similar gastrointestinal problem . All patient evaluate hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) modify version gastrointestinal symptom rating scale IBS ( GSRS-IBS ) .</detailed_description>
