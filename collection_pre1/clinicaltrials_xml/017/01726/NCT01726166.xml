	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) relatively common infant , occurence rate 10 % . It frequent male preterm newborn infant lead significant problem infant include blood infection , kidney infection , kidney scar affect kidney work later life . Analysis collect urine presence bacteria fungus way make certain UTI diagnosis . Urine culture result may take 24 48 hour become available . Sterile collection urine achieve newborn infant urinary catheterization ( UC ) catheter pass urethra bladder , suprapubic aspiration ( SPA ) needle insert bladder abdominal wall , 'clean catch ' urine collect sterile bottle baby urinate preparation UC . The main advantage SPA bypass bacteria normally reside urethral opening , thus minimize risk contamination . Some study suggest SPA well UC collect urine sterile fashion neonate due difficulty sterile UC small infant result contaminate sample ( also call false-positive urine culture ) ; problem way study do still clear best choice . UC commonly use many Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) consider less invasive , do nursing staff , generally high chance obtain urine . SPA simple safe alternative , although study suggest painful UC , perform quickly . The reported success rate SPA variable , greatly increase ultrasound confirm urine bladder SPA . The question remain : best method sterile collection urine newborn young infant ? In study , investigator try answer question collect urine infant admit NICU use either ultrasound guide SPA UC compare contamination rate two method . The investigator hypothesize SPA result less contamination urine sample . The investigator also hypothesize success obtain adequate urine sample ( 0.5 ml ) SPA , SPA quicker perform , difference associate complication rate SPA UC .</brief_summary>
