	<brief_summary>The investigator aim study investigate effect 4 week robot-assisted locomotor training motor recovery low extremity walk ability compare conventional gait train subacute post-stroke non-ambulatory hemiplegic patient . 72 first-ever stroke patient could walk independently ( FAC &lt; 2 ) , suffer within 6 month enrol randomly assign 2 group . The subject congestive heart failure , malignancy , cardiopulmonary dysfunction , could walk independently stroke attack exclude . Two group receive 30 minute conventional gait training include Neurodevelopmental Treatment ( NDT ) basically . The robotic assisted locomotor training group receive additional robotic-assisted gait therapy 30minutes Lokomat® ( Hocoma , Zurich , Switzerland ) daily 4 week , conventional gait training group receive additional daily conventional gait training NDT period . The independent walking ability ( FAC ≥ 3 ) , Functional Ambulation Category ( FAC ) , Motricity index ( MI ) , Fugl-Meyer assessment ( FMA ) , Modified Barthel Index ( MBI ) , Medical Research Council ( MRC ) low extremity muscle assess , ( 2weeks ) training . And independent walking ability follow 3 month .</brief_summary>
