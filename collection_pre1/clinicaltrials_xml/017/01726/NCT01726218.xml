	<brief_summary>It well know motor area one hemisphere brain ( motor cortex ) control movement opposite body . However , clear whether movement becomes complicate , motor cortex hemispheres brain involve . Currently role motor cortex side body ( referred ipsilateral motor cortex ) hand performance remain controversial . The investigator demonstrate previously healthy subject transiently lower activity ipsilateral motor cortex improve performance opposite hand . What know mechanisms involve change behavior . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) device allow non- invasive stimulation brain . When brain stimulate repetitively low rate low intensity 15 minute , stimulate brain area become less active . This effect last 10 minute call `` transient artificial lesion '' mimicks effect transiently interfere function stimulate brain area . In present study investigator conduct experiment use repetitive TMS downregulate activity motor area previous experiment measure effect activity motor cortex hemisphere . The investigator study healthy subject . It would important understand effect detail design treatment strategy patient stroke , topic future study .</brief_summary>
