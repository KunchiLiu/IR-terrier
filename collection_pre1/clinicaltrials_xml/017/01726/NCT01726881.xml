	<brief_summary>People Spinal Cord Injury develop chronic pain within month injury . Up 80 % patient develop chronic pain call `` central pain '' describe pain : burning , stabbing , `` like electricity . '' Central pain mechanism unknown therefore treatment currently effective . It hypothesize chronic pain associate impaired function system regulate pain , however , hypothesis test among Spinal Cord Injury patient . Presence connection , regulate system dysfunction central pain , help predict risk central pain develop treatment . The current research objective make several sensory measurement measure function mechanisms regulation control pain . These measurement accept throughout world base psychophysical assessment patient . Measurements design ass whether Spinal Cord Injury chronic central pain patient demonstrate impairment regulation pain . Finding link central pain impaired regulation could shed light mechanism central pain . In addition , measurement design ass whether fresh spinal cord injury patient yet developed central pain demonstrate impairment regulation pain immediately injury . By repeated assessment pain regulation capability , make fresh Spinal Cord Injury patient first month injury , compare result measurement develop center pain , could identify indicator predict risk central pain . Another goal study investigate efficacy central pain treatment , use TENS , parameter TENS treatment build accord level function regulate system individual .</brief_summary>
