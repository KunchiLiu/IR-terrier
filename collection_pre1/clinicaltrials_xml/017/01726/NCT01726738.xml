	<detailed_description>The present phase II study 20 patient BRAFV600E mutant , unresectable stage III/IV melanoma design explore mechanisms tumor acquire resistance combination BRAF MEK inhibition . Overall response rate duration combination also assess . Tissue collect baseline progression ( clinical radiological ) . Patients may remain treatment progression ( discretion investigator ) long still experience clinical benefit . We anticipate 50 % patient may continue therapy post-progression 2-8 week . BRF113220 , phase I/II trial BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib combination MEK inhibitor trametinib ongoing metastatic melanoma establish safety combination , determine recommend phase 2 dos ( RP2D ) agent . Expansion cohort RP2D drug combination include phase I characterize safety detail , explore efficacy combination . The combination well tolerate describe section 1.5 , decrease frequency rash compare either agent alone 1 report cutaneous SCC . This propose study utilize RP2D determine Phase I/II study : trametinib 2mg QD dabrafenib 150 mg BID . Despite promise overall response rate 81 % , patient also likely go develop resistance result new resistance mutation , give cooperative signal network kinase sense inhibition key nodal kinases induce compensatory response offset pharmacological intervention . The study objectives follow : Objectives Primary Objective To identify kinase differentially express pre- post-treatment BRAF ( dabrafenib ) MEK ( trametinib ) inhibitor , determine kinome signature predictive resistance BRAF/MEK inhibition stage III/IV melanoma Secondary Objectives To explore whether resistance BRAF MEK inhibition associate new functional mutation approximately 150 oncogene / tumor suppressor gene assess 10 % tumor ( use NextGen DNA sequence technology ) subset patient co-enroll LCCC1108 , particular focus one five establish resistance gene ( BRAF , NRAS , MEK1 , MAP3K8 COT , PTEN ) To determine overall response rate ( ORR : complete response + partial response ) measure via RECISTv1.1 To estimate duration ORR measure via RECISTv1.1 To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) define RECISTv1.1 To estimate rate overall survival ( OS ) 1 year day 1 treatment Primary Endpoint Kinome signature pathway base comparison kinome expression pre- post-treatment biopsy use Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads ( MIBs ) couple mass spectrometry .</detailed_description>
