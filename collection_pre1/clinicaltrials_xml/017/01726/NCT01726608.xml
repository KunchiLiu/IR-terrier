	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate technique call Simplicity III速 Radiofrequency Neurotomy effective improve management sacroiliac joint pain . Currently variety treatment manage pain still doubt treatment effective . Simplicity III速 one treatment sacroiliac joint pain use NHS many year . It use electrical current generate heat around tip needle place close nerve supply sacro-iliac joint . This heat ablate specific nerve supply joint improves pain . The traditional method use treat type pain use multiple injection target nerve supply joint . This method however time consume result variable depend upon number injection . Therefore new electrode , call Simplicity III速 , develop allow treatment undertaken use few injection . Although treatment receive formal approval , undergone conformity assessment available certain specialist NHS centre clinical use , presently limited evidence regard clinical efficacy . We wish test effectiveness new device treat sacroiliac joint pain . The best way prove clinical effectiveness compare Simplicity III速 identical procedure electrode switch neither patient doctor aware whether switch . Once pain assess 3 month , patient receive active treatment remain pain offer active treatment .</brief_summary>
