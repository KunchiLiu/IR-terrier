	<brief_title>Overnight Type 1 Diabetes Control Under MD-Logic Closed Loop System Patient 's Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last two decade , remarkable technological progress make development continuous glucose sensor , miniature device , implantable pump sensor wireless communication , interest closed-loop insulin delivery revive . Control trail evaluate clinical benefit continuous glucose sensor show improved HbA1c significant increase sever hypoglycemia , trend towards low hypoglycemic episode although significant significant change sever hypoglycemia . One main drawback continuous glucose sensor noncompliant patient , flow information need act accordingly make devise burden patient . Theoretically subcutaneous insulin pump glucose sensor attach artificial pancreas closed-loop system mimic activity function pancreatic beta cell , strict control blood glucose level . Such system may also offer opportunity free patient daily burden deal diabetes . Study Objectives determine safety efficacy use MDLAP system automatically control overnight blood glucose type 1 diabetic patient . Overnight glucose control time define time range bedtime ( 21:00-23:00 PM ) awake time ( 7:00 AM ) . This randomized prospective single blind trial evaluate blood glucose control overnight closed-loop insulin delivery MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas ( MDLAP ) system patient type 1 diabetes , conduct : Tel Aviv , Israel , Ljubljana , Slovenia Hannover , Germany ; 75 eligible patient enrolled.Each subject participate four consecutive night closed-loop MDLAP , four additional night regular sensor augment pump therapy home washout period 10 ± 3 day arm .</detailed_description>
