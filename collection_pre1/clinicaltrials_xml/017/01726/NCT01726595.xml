	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize doctor nurse undergo brief period training use ultrasound accurately measure blood flow forearm artery brief period flow interrupt blood pressure cuff , measurement investigator call reactive hyperemia . Reactive hyperemia indicate whether small blood vessel body healthy -- lower reactive hyperemia indicate bad small blood vessel function . When measure experience ultrasound expert , low reactive hyperemia strongly predict death critically ill patient infection ( severe sepsis ) . The investigator conduct study determine doctor nurse , without specific pre-existing expertise ultrasound , train make measurement accurately . If , investigator prove measurement apply reliably real-world practice . The investigator also hypothesize reactive hyperemia predict outcome illness patient severe infection , critically ill patient well . Finally , investigator hypothesize reduce blood flow blood pressure cuff occlusion link abnormality blood , previously identify critically ill patient . For example , red blood cell patient severe sepsis show stiffer normal , less able flow along small blood vessel passages body . Red blood cell become stiffer certain type stress body know `` oxidative stress . '' If investigator show low reactive hyperemia , stiff red blood cell , oxidative stress link , investigator hope develop new treatment reduce oxidative stress , reduce stiffness red blood cell , turn improve reactive hyperemia . Improvements reactive hyperemia indicate improvement small blood vessel function . Better small blood vessel function mean good delivery oxygen throughout body . The investigator believe improve outcome critically ill patient .</brief_summary>
