	<brief_summary>Patients choose participate study undergo particular type brain surgery treat hemifacial spasm . This surgery call microvascular decompression ( MVD ) involve facial nerve . The facial nerve compress one blood vessel contact produce facial twitch . The investigator know blood vessel touch facial nerve produce facial twitch .

	<detailed_description>`` Intra Operative Monitoring '' ( IOM ) standard routine medical practice patient MVD surgery . IOM do make sure hear face nerve accidentally bump damage surgery . After anesthetic induction , neurophysiologist place electrodes nerve , scalp muscle . Stimulation monitor muscle twitch common , safe painless medical procedure . In study , investigator would like measure nerve muscle function normal side compare nerve muscle function abnormal side different level anesthetic desflurane . In order monitor normal side face one additional set electrode place facial muscle . The investigator compare response three different level anesthetic . The technique use motor evoked potential . The effect anesthesia lateral spread response also examine . This response evident symptomatic side . These observation take approximately 10 15 minute delay lengthen surgery .</detailed_description>
