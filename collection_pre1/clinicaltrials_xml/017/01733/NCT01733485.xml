	<brief_summary>Asthma inflammatory disease , mean cause swell lung cause shortness breath and/or wheeze . There several asthma medication help reduce problem . The objective research study characterize presence electrophilic fatty acid bronchial airway subject control asthma baseline treatment Aspirin , Indomethacin , treatment . The presence electrophilic fatty acid may indicate inflammation . Aspirin Indomethacin know respectively increase inhibit formation electrophilic fatty acid . By gain good understand electrophilic fatty acid work respond different treatment , researcher hope able find good way lessen airway inflammation asthma future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Relevant asthma , chemical identity potent anti-inflammatory signaling action endogenously-produced Electrophilic Fatty acid OXidation product ( EFOXs ) recently describe . Endogenous EFOXs include nitro alpha beta-unsaturated ketone derivative unsaturated fatty acid generate byproduct ) fatty acid oxidation nitration inflammatory-derived reactive specie b ) enzymatic fatty acid oxygenation reaction catalyze cyclooxygenase-2 lipoxygenases . Recent data reveal multiple salutary post-translational protein modification induce EFOXs . Specifically , covalent adduction functionally-significant thiols signal protein occurs , reaction modulate critical inflammatory signal pathway . These signal protein include nuclear lipid receptor PPARg redox-sensitive transcription factor NF kappaB Keap1/Nrf2 . This propose research investigate concept reversible reaction EFOXs critical transcription factor result regulation adaptive response inflammation . In clinical study , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BAL ) obtain asthmatic treat COX-2 inhibitor enhance ( aspirin ) inhibit ( indomethacin ) COX-2 dependent EFOX generation , well assign intervention . BAL obtain healthy , non-smoking adult control asthma least 12 % increase FEV1 short-acting bronchodilator treatment positive methacholine response ( reduction FEV1 â‰¥ 20 % 16 mg/ml ) . A total 30 asthmatic subject randomize ( 10 per arm ) ) aspirin , b ) indomethacin c ) intervention group</detailed_description>
