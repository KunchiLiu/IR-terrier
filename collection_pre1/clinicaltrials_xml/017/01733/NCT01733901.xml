	<brief_summary>To study whether renal sympathetic denervation ( RSD ) reduce all-cause mortality recurrence rate composite cardiovascular event ( include angina , myocardial infarction , repeat percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass graft ) patient percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Besides whether RSD reduce risk factor coronary heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Denervation Secondary Prevention Patients After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease lead cause death worldwide , contribute 7.2 million death annually . The main measure secondary prevention coronary heart disease optimize drug therapy change lifestyle . optimize drug therapy , include aspirin , beta receptor blocker , lipid regulating drug ( mostly statins , small part fibrates ) vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor . However , situation secondary prevention coronary heart disease satisfy . EuroASPIRE III survey find despite effective drug use primary secondary prevention coronary heart disease , coronary heart disease risk factor , high blood glucose , hypertension , high cholesterol obesity , still poorly control . At time sympathetic activation play extremely important role development coronary heart disease , high sympathetic activity acute myocardial infarction closely related malignant arrhythmia heart failure . Recently , many clinical research verify catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation ( RSD ) safely use substantially reduce blood pressure , reduce leave ventricular hypertrophy , improve glucose tolerance sleep apnea severity . Simultaneously , mark reduction muscle whole-body sympathetic-nerve activity ( MSNA ) apparent , decrease renal whole-body norepinephrine spillover . Hypertension , diabetes , high norepinephrine level obstructive sleep apnea recognize risk factor development recurrence coronary heart disease . So , design randomize parallel control clinical study demonstrate whether RSD reduce mortality recurrence rate composite cardiovascular event patient PCI , besides whether RSD reduce risk factor coronary heart disease .</detailed_description>
