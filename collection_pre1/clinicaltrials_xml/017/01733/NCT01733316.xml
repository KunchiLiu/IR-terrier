	<brief_summary>The purpose study gather information effectiveness ( well work treat cystinosis ) safety new form cysteamine bitartrate call RP103 , compare already-approved drug cystinosis patient take call Cystagon® . In cystinosis , body build cystine . When take regularly , active ingredient Cystagon® ( cysteamine bitartrate ) reduce cystine body . RP103 active ingredient Cystagon® design reduce cystine similar way Cystagon® . To decide RP103 good Cystagon® , study look two type blood test . One test pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , measure amount white blood cell ( WBC ) cystine take study drug . WBC cystine laboratory test use find cysteamine bitartrate reduce cystine level body . The second test pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , measure amount cysteamine blood take drug . RP103 different Cystagon® : Instead cysteamine bitartrate absorb stomach , RP103 design absorbed small intestine . This may make effect drug last longer , take twice day instead four time day like Cystagon® . Some cystinosis patient bad breath ( halitosis ) take Cystagon® . Study participant experience bad breath Cystagon® ask would like participate optional `` halitosis substudy '' investigate issue collect extra PK blood sample .</brief_summary>
