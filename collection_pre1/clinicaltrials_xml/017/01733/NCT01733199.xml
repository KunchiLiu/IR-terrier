	<brief_summary>This study compose main study ancillary one . The objective main study define , psychopathological , neurological , pharmacokinetic genetic plan , predictive factor develop behavioural addiction ( BA ) secondarily dopaminergic treatment , associate dopamine dysregulation syndrome ( DDS ) , patient Parkinson 's disease . 3 particular profile patient establish : - BA- : secondary behavioural addiction - BA+/DDS- : secondary behavioural addiction , without dopamine dysregulation syndrome - BA+/DDS+ : secondary behavioural addiction , dopamine dysregulation syndrome We wish particular : - To differentiate , among BA+ subject , DDS evoke side effect dopaminergic treatment - To demonstrate BA+/DDS- subject present pharmacokinetic particularity cause occurrence BA . - To clarify possible relationship dosage pharmacodynamics treatment ( especially pramipexole ) one hand , develop BA hand . - Demonstrate subject BA + / DDS- individually genetic vulnerability ( relate dopamine system ) , originally occurrence BA . This study several level evaluation , choose describe methodology study 3 axis : Psychopathology axis , Neurological axis pharmacokinetic axis . The pharmacokinetic aspect study part sample , ancillary study center pharmacokinetic pramipexole ( immediate release form ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This monocentric study recruitment period comprise October 2012 April 2016 . The recruitment occur consultation service neurology . If subject eligible , study propose , evaluation fix next day . This evaluation consist individual face-to-face interview base standardized semi-structured questionnaire , approximately one half hour . It 's focused different characteristic Parkinson 's disease , psychiatric addictive co morbidity . The evaluation complete set self-administered questionnaire focus impulsivity Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . For 80 patient participate ancillary study , blood sample realize patient arrive , intake treatment ( obtain residual plasmatic concentration ) . A second sample realize different time patient , cover entirety kinetic 2 intake pramipexole ( immediate release form ) via entire sample . The second blood sample realize four hour first one . After second sample , patient complete participation study . Secondly , monitor include self-questionnaire booklet saliva sample offer patient complete initial visit .</detailed_description>
