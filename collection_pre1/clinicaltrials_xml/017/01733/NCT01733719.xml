	<brief_summary>LAY SUMMARY A type gullet cancer ( oesophageal adenocarcinoma ) become 5th common UK cause cancer death . Unfortunately , time patient symptom , cancer often incurable . People Barrett 's oesophagus ( change gullet line occur acid reflux ) risk cancer regular check-ups , involve examination endoscope ( instrument insert mouth , mild sedation require ) . A small proportion people Barrett 's develop change ( might become cancer ) gullet lining ; , important remove affect tissue cancer develop , early stage . There several way remove tissue investigator know best . The standard treatment surgery , small risk die operation , patient often suffer complication affect year afterwards . Two endoscopic treatment involve surgery . Both involve remove visible abnormality technique call endoscopic resection , follow cauterise remain Barrett 's gullet lining 1 2 technique . One recommend National Institute Health Clinical Excellence , expensive less widely available second . No-one compare treatment , surgery , randomise trial ( reliable way decide best ) . Patient group say would prefer avoid surgery alternative work , encourage u trial . This feasibility study vital step towards two trial : ( ) trial compare two non-surgical technique ( b ) trial compare surgery endoscopic treatment . It help u find whether possible enroll retain enough patient use several centre , identify/resolve potential barrier recruitment retention , include explore viewpoint patient surgeon .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study comprise 2 part : Firstly , randomise 100 suitable patient 1 year period , identify upper gastrointestinal cancer specialist multidisciplinary team meeting 6 expert English centre . Patients either high grade dysplasia ( HGD ) early cancer Barrett 's oesophagus ( BE ) randomise two curative endoscopic non-surgical therapy ( endoscopic resection [ ER ] argon plasma photocoagulation [ APC ] versus ER radiofrequency ablation [ RFA ] ) . All technique use current clinical practice , never directly compare . Secondly , 2 qualitative study examine clinician ' surgeon 's attitude towards trial oesophageal surgery compare endoscopic treatment ( ER ablation ) questionnaire . Qualitative interview purposive sample patient explore view randomisation , recruitment participation help identify pre-empt problem subsequent plan trial endoscopic treatment compare surgical removal part gullet . Participants randomise ER plus RFA ER plus APC group enrollment . The randomisation schedule manage University Leicester Clinical Trials Unit , use computer generate random assignment . Randomisation stratify length Barrett 's epithelium ( &lt; 5 ; 5-10 ; &gt; 10 cm ) . DETAILS OF SAMPLE SIZE Currently available estimate eradication rate poor precision , derive small case series . Consequently sample size choose allow estimation quantity interest whilst expose many patient trial procedure . 10- -15 new case per million population per year treat . Each participate centre base upper gastrointestinal cancer treatment centre serve 1.5- - 2 million people . Since centre would expect see 15- - 20 new patient year , aim recruit 100 patient 1 year 6 UK centre . ENDOSCOPIC INTERVENTIONS ER , RFA APC technique use current practice , investigator familiar . We ensure investigator use technique histological assessment scrutinise external expert pathology panel ( see quality control ) . Best practice perform ER visible lesion . We therefore aim complete resection visible lesion initially ablate residual flat Barrett 's mucosa subsequent treatment session ( 2 monthly interval 8 month initial treatment ER ) . The treatment phase trial terminate 8 month . At T= 12 month , diagnostic high resolution endoscopy perform targeted biopsy abnormal area well 4 quadrant biopsy 2 cm interval area contain previously contain BE . The biopsy order identify 'buried ' Barrett 's gland new squamous epithelium . The clinical endpoint 1 year recurrent persistent HGD cancer assess . Any residual BE ( contain HGD cancer ) assess record . QUALITATIVE STUDIES A purposive sub-sample patient ( sample strategy design include wide range view experience , include patient centre ) interview telephone invite take part feasibility trial , use topic guide ( develop collaboratively lay representative , emphasis encouraging patient describe perspective freely - preliminary topic guide develop included application ) , explore view invite participate research randomise different treatment option . The interview would also invite view conduct trial endotherapy versus surgery . Interviews audio-recorded separate consent transcribe verbatim transcriber work professional standard confidentiality . Analysis Qualitative Data Analysis interview transcript base constant comparative approach manage NVivo software . The finding thus include set issue important patient perspective , help/hinder recruitment retention , inform subsequent trial . Surgeon/clinician Questionnaires A purposive sample surgeon clinician expert centre receive questionnaire explore view endotherapy surgery treatment Barrett 's oesophagus HGD early cancer propose trial ( include 'free text ' option invite view randomization trial compare surgery endoscopic treatment ) . Questionnaires distribute 100 oesophagogastric surgeon clinician ( lead MDT gastroenterologist expert endoscopists ) participate centre centre UK advise surgical lead . The questionnaire administer e mail . A second e mail follow month case non-response , chose respond thereafter contact . Quality life assessment healthcare cost assessment Quality Life assess baseline 6 12 month visit , use EORTC Quality Life Questionnaire version 3.0 ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) module QLQ-OES18 ass specific relevant aspect quality life relate oesophageal disease . General quality life also assess use EQ-5D . Additional data healthcare utilisation collect baseline , 6 12 month use questionnaire develop patient ask complete schedule visit endoscopy . The perspective economic analysis NHS personal social service . Costs obtain include cost endoscopic treatment continue endoscopic surveillance group , well additional intervention initial 8- month therapeutic phase trial . The cost salvage treatment stage include . We test validity feasibility administer economic evaluation questionnaire ( patient healthcare utilisation questionnaire EQ-5D ) , examine response rate achieve level miss data . EORTC QLQ- C30 also test directly estimate QALYs use EORTC- 8D . Both EQ-5D EORTC use obtain appropriate information cost per QALY analysis future economic evaluation . The economic analysis inform sample size calculation necessary information calculate cost saving future economic evaluation .</detailed_description>

CT scan ( thorax &amp; top 1/3 abdomen ) : negative evidence locally advance metastatic disease ( do discretion multidisciplinary team , invasive cancer T1m disease ) ; PETCT usually require may carry indicated discretion multidisciplinary team . Suitability trial agree local upper gastrointestinal cancer multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) . Able give inform consent Able ( applicable ) discontinue Clopidogrel 7 day &amp; endotherapy i.e . 14 day total . Able ( applicable ) discontinue Warfarin without bridge plan use low molecular weight heparin . The Warfarin restart 17 day endotherapy accord local endoscopist 's usual clinical practice . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Histology : depth invasion beyond muscularis mucosa histologically ( &gt; T1m ) , poorly differentiate T1m cancer lymphatic invasion vascular invasion . Short tongue ( &lt; 2 cm ) Barrett 's epithelium could completely remove Endoscopic Resection No localise endoscopically identifiable abnormality high definition endoscopy ( without magnification chromoendoscopic technique ) Prior oesophageal endoscopic therapy : e.g . Photodynamic Therapy , Endoscopic resection , prior ablation technique argon ablation .
