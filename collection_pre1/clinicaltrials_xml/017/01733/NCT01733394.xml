	<brief_summary>The United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) specific rule generic drug company must follow get generic copy seizure medication approve . Currently , FDA approve generic drug require study normal volunteer n't epilepsy take one dose generic drug follow series blood test . Some people epilepsy physician complain side effect loss seizure control take generic drug , one know complaint truly problem generic drug . This research determine whether several different generic version brand version medication lamotrigine perform similar way give people epilepsy . The study drug Lamictal® ( lamotrigine ) generic form lamotrigine test approved FDA treatment seizure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Equivalence Among Antiepileptic Drug Generic Brand Products People With Epilepsy : Single-Dose 6-Period Replicate Design ( EQUIGEN Single-Dose Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study propose protocol determine bioequivalence test perform FDA translates similar bioequivalence population people epilepsy switch among different generic anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) . Based variety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data clinical report concern , example anti epilepsy drug ( AED ) use study lamotrigine ( LTG ) . In single dose study , people epilepsy take AEDs , currently take test medication , lamotrigine , study . We use order-randomized three-sequence six-period replicate design two disparate generic study two replicate period brand ( reference ) product study two additional period . A standard single dose test drug ( lamotrigine 25mg ) administer controlled condition ( fast subsequent standardized meal ) 12-hour in-facility blood sample collection follow collection every 24 hour total 96 hour sample collection use establish pharmacokinetic measure Cmax , AUC96 AUC∞ . Each period separate least 12 day washout interval . The replicate study use determine intra-individual variability pharmacokinetic response brand two generic product , well subject-by-formulation interaction variance . The data also use calculate simultaneously parameter need compare 3 product average individual bioequivalence outlier analysis . The difference disparate generic use establish current standard translate equivalence within limit brand intra-subject variation . The factor use determine disparate generic include result vivo data ABE study submit FDA ANDA vitro chemical assay ( potency ) dissolution data perform several currently available lot . The intent study specific lot generic product predict result low level compare specific lot another generic product predict result high level . Similarly , multiple lot brand product available , perform vitro test establish desirable lot study . Factors alter metabolism , include concomitant AEDs may hepatic enzyme induction effect track excluded , long dose remains constant , goal reproduce 'real life ' situation closely possible within practical limit fund study size . Subjects receive valproate concomitant medication exclude prolongation half life would allow LTG reliably completely cleared 13 day . The criterion establish enrich population also track used secondary analysis , use inclusion requirement . The enriched population define people experienced otherwise unexplained increase seizure adverse effect , substantial change AED level switch AED product . The discovery subject-by-formulation interaction outlier ( i.e . subject differential pharmacokinetic reaction pair formulation ) raise considerable concern equivalence . Recently establish method statistical analysis outlier crossover study use determine outlier present . Qualified subject screen upon fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion sign informed consent enrol study enter randomization phase ( 2-30 day ) . Subjects randomize accord seal allocation list balance sequence provide site prior first subject enrollment . Subjects withdraw prior complete third period replace randomized manner . The randomization list generate study statistical group . There six test period three sequence sequence-randomized study . During two test period subject receive single dose brand AED four test period subject receive single dose one two investigated generic ( twice ) . The single dos administer fast state in-facility 12-hour pharmacokinetic session collect sample determine Cmax AUCs . Four additional sample draw 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour dose outpatient ( make pharmacokinetic test last 4 day ) . Each in-facility pharmacokinetic testing separate 12-23 day washout period ; consistent washout period 14 day prefer . A final follow-up phone evaluation conduct 12-16 day ( target 14 day ) last dose . During study subject continue usual concomitant medication , include AEDs , without change . Investigators compare AED level measure Cmax AUC group use average bioequivalence ( ABE ) individual bioequivalence ( IBE ) criterion . Average bioequivalence establish 90 % confidence interval geometric mean Cmax AUCs disparate generic product compare entirely within 80 % -125 % range ( FDA criterion bioequivalence ) use two one-sided standard analysis . Otherwise product consider bioequivalent . Similarly , product consider bioequivalent criterion IBE generic product compare brand product meet . Study Population : Approximately 54 subject ( 45 subject completion ) . Number center : 3 site enrol approximately 18 subject . Duration study : Approximately 1 year .</detailed_description>
