	<detailed_description>This 2-part study conduct single study center . Part 1 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , ascending-dose study . During course Part 1 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase follow-up visit . There total 7 cohort , consist different dose level , 8 subject per cohort . In cohort , 6 subject receive dose CC-220 2 subject receive placebo depend randomization schedule . A single dose administer subject . This study design allow safety tolerability data gather stepwise fashion . Administration study drug next high dose level begin safety tolerability precede dose evaluate deem acceptable investigator sponsor 's medical monitor . Part 2 open-label , randomize , 2-period , 2-way crossover study . During course Part 2 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase study period , treatment phase study period follow-up visit . A total 10 subject receive single dose 1 mg CC-220 2 study period , without food food , depend treatment sequence randomize . The CC-220 dose study period separate washout 11 14 day .</detailed_description>
