	<detailed_description>Siemens Molecular Imaging ( SMI ) seek determine [ F-18 ] T807 might useful non-invasive assessment tool clinical evaluation subject condition associate tau protein aggregate , Alzheimer 's disease . The information collect exploratory study use diagnostic purpose , assessment participant 's response therapy clinical management participant . However , exploratory study provide baseline information safety , biodistribution , dosimetry [ F-18 ] T807 . These data aid design future study [ F-18 ] T807 patient Alzheimer 's disease . Overall , study provide initial data inform development [ F-18 ] T807 first PET image agent human tau protein related pathology .</detailed_description>
