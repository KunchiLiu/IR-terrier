	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether CARTISTEM , cell therapeutic product , safe effective treatment articular cartilage defect knee result ageing , trauma , degenerative disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Exploratory Efficacy CARTISTEM® , Cell Therapy Product Articular Cartilage Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional treatment modality able provide complete sustain resolution symptom follow damage articular cartilage . Despite numerous technique available today , complete heal damage defective cartilage consistent reproduction normal hyaline cartilage occur , continuous drug administration secondary surgery common . Research mesenchymal stem cell rapid acceleration past decade MSC-based therapy become one object investigation new branch medicine term regenerative medicine . This emerge technology show great promise produce transplantable cartilage construct restore function degenerate joint . CARTISTEM® , combination human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell sodium hyaluronate , intend use single-dose cellular therapeutic agent cartilage regeneration human subject cartilage defect knee result ageing , trauma , degenerative disease .</detailed_description>
