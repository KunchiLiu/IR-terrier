	<detailed_description>Hypertension ( HT ) common side effect see trial bevacizumab combination chemotherapy . Based hypothesis development hypertension treatment would indicative successful blockade VEGF pathway , different study explore retrospectively relationship hypertension result treatment bevacizumab . This study aim demonstrate association hypertension ( diagnose optimally ) efficacy treatment bevacizumab prospectively secondly verify blood pressure measure take home reflection diagnosis hypertension . Also explore different molecular marker involve pathway VEGF might use predictor response . Therefore , study include collection blood sample ( serum plasma ) tumor tissue patient include study , aim explore biomarkers correlate treatment efficacy toxicity . The diagnosis hypertension ( HT ) perform use Holter recording , standard blood pressure footage collect first three cycle treatment give Common Toxicity Criteria National Cancer Institute-NCI CTCAE version 4.0 guideline European Society Cardiology Hypertension , 2007 . Will collect sample primary tumor blood patient previously consent . Samples send central laboratory analysis biomarkers . An interim analysis conduct assess true incidence hypertension . Based analysis , evaluate need recalculate sample size . At end study , perform analysis correlation data measure HTA Holter record footage SLP standard TA . Moreover determine serum , plasma tumor tissue certain biomarkers correlate efficacy treatment bevacizumab .</detailed_description>
