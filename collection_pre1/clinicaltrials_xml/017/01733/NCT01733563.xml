	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate impact sugar sweeten beverage fat metabolism healthy young men . It well know consumption beverage sweeten fructose associate different health risk type 2 diabetes . The present study design dissect difference metabolic pathway fructose glucose , also metabolic adaptation fructose , glucose sucrose diet . During period seven week subject consume either fructose , glucose sucrose sweeten beverage continue usual drinking habit . During seven week different metabolic investigation use stable isotope tracer . First , rate lipolysis beta-oxidation determine . Second , rate fatty acid synthesis measure . During examination also substrate- energy-utilization measurement indirect calorimetry , blood analysis morphometric measurement . Based literature main hypothesis : Fructose enhance de novo lipogenesis postprandially also fast state significantly glucose enhanced expression lipogenic enzyme . Fructose decrease beta oxidation via downregulation oxidative enzyme .</brief_summary>
