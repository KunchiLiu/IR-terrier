It appear lipids arise mutant enzyme reduce affinity normal preferred substrate L-serine . The investigator plan perform two year study L-serine supplementation correct biochemistry neurological disease human HSAN1 .

	<detailed_description>The study objective evaluate efficacy L-serine subject hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 ( HSAN1 ) . Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type I ( HSAN1 ) progressive debilitate illness currently treatment exists . The investigator recently identify two novel deoxysphingoid base ( DSB ) accumulate plasma HSAN1 patient mutant transgenic HSAN1 mouse . The disease cause missense mutation SPTLC1 gene encode subunit enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase ( SPT ) . In normal circumstance SPT enzyme catalyze reaction palmitoyl-CoA serine form sphinganine . The two newly identify DSB , deoxysphinganine deoxymethylsphinganine , arise condensation palmitoyl-CoA alanine glycine respectively , suggest HSAN1 mutation alter amino acid selectivity SPT . In support hypothesis investigator show level DSB human mice lower supplementation enzyme 's normal substrate , serine . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross study investigator enroll 20 research participant HSAN1 10 subject assign L-serine ( 400mg/kg/d ) 10 assign placebo treat 12 month . The 10 subject assign placebo cross active L-serine remain 12 month . The progression HSAN1 measure change establish clinical rating scale measure intraepidermal nerve fiber density ( IENFD ) skin biopsy . L-serine level measure use 24-hour pharmacokinetic blood sample 12-month interval . The investigator assess percentage failure ( clinical decline &gt; 1 point CMTNS &gt; 30 % decrease IENFD ) 6 month interval . Regardless CMTNS score , subject placebo first year switch active study drug year two . After 2 year period subject give option re-consented open label extension . All consented subject treat L-serine ( 400 mg/kg/d ) additional year .</detailed_description>
