	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise impact bodily process implicated pathophysiology major depression . Consistent effect , aerobic exercise general , run particular , repeatedly show immediate mood elevate longer-term antidepressant effect . To investigator ' knowledge , study run therapeutic intervention mood subject run standard run shoe , despite increase evidence run barefoot shoe minimal effect foot strike ( i.e . `` minimally shod '' ) lead marked change people run way might physiological effect relevance health . Thus , nothing currently know difference effect depression-relevant physiological emotional functioning run either barefoot minimally-shod vs. run standard running shoe ( hereafter call `` shoed ) . The current pilot study design begin address issue examine effect minimally shoe vs. shoed run non-invasive measure autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) function mood state . The investigator select ANS physiological focus current study several reason include : 1 ) run acutely alters ANS activity ; 2 ) running ( aerobic fitness general ) associate increase parasympathetic reduce sympathetic activity rest ; 3 ) increase parasympathetic tone body repeatedly associate emotional well-being stress resilience , whereas reduce parasympathetic tone reliably associate major depression ; 4 ) give increase evidence ancestral human may run exceptionally long distance hunt prey exhaustion , likely run conduct fairly significant parasympathetic tone reduce energy expenditure ; 5 ) ancestral human run barefoot minimally shod suggest type foot strike pattern encourage style run may enhance parasympathetic tone compare run heel strike occur run shoed ; 6 ) therefore minimally shod run might differentially impact parasympathetic tone way would make effective treatment depression run shoed .</detailed_description>
