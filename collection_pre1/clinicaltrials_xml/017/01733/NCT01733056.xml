	<brief_summary>Biomedical Lay Summary Title : Characterization immune response vaccination patient receive single-drug immunosuppressive therapy Principal Investigator : Robert Swerlick , MD Other Investigators : Rafi Ahmed , PhD Suephy Chen , MD Jens Wrammert , PhD Adam Sperduto 1 . Problem Interest We propose study effectiveness vaccine people take drug affect immune system . There many population people chronic medical condition require long-term treatment immunosuppressive medication ( drug decrease function immune system ) . Examples patient include organ transplant recipient , patient immune cell cancer leukemia lymphoma , patient inflammatory disorder lupus scleroderma , patient skin condition require steroid-based cream , ointment , pill , injection . Patients take medication receive appropriate vaccination tetanus booster , influenza vaccine , pneumonia vaccine . The effectiveness vaccination depend large part strong response vaccine immune system . Drugs decrease immune system function therefore , may also decrease effectiveness vaccine . 2 . How Problem Interest study We plan give three different group participant influenza vaccination measure participant 's immune system response blood test . The three group : 1 . Healthy people take immunosuppressive medication 2 . Patients skin condition require treatment azathioprine currently take immunosuppressive agent 3 . Patients psoriasis require treatment TNF-alpha ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) currently take immunosuppressive medication . All participant 18 - 89 year old influenza vaccination within previous six month . We administer vaccination day 0 . We take blood sample day 0 , 7 , 28 follow vaccination . We use blood sample measure amount antibody produce vaccine response specific immune system cell know B-lymphocytes . Using statistical method , compare finding three group participant determine difference response vaccination exist . 3 . How research advance scientific knowledge and/or human health To knowledge scientific data available regard effectiveness vaccination patient receive one specific immunosuppressive medication . We also use new technique develop Emory measure B-lymphocyte response vaccine . This research could potentially help guide vaccination strategy people require immunosuppressive medication prevent infectious disease population well general population .</brief_summary>
