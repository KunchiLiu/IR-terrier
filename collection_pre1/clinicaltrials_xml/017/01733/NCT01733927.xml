	<brief_title>An Evaluation Rapid Test HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human Immunodeficiency Virus /Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) continue one devastating worldwide pandemic . In response HIV/AIDS epidemic , Joint United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS 2010 , urge country improve access HIV/AIDS test counsel effort increase number people know HIV status , thereby attempt decrease transmission increase treatment . Thus , effective country response increase voluntary test counseling , particularly among at-risk population . Ensuring patient receive test result essential component effort . Chile , since 1991 , see increase notify case HIV/ AIDS among certain region country . The Chilean government offer free screen HIV use ELISA test . In addition , many Chileans fail return receive test result , many individual worldwide . In United States , Center Disease Control report use `` gold standard HIV testing '' ( ELISA ) 30 % people negative result 39 % people positive result return test result . In Western county , well several Latin American country , use rapid test technology identify HIV 1 2 increased percentage people learn serological status compare test use traditional ELISA method . Neither rapid test ELISA yield definitive diagnosis , confirmation testing require use Western Blot rule possibility false positive result . Nonetheless , provide quick turn-around , rapid test helps facilitate individual receive initial test result , thereby increase probability quickly refer appropriate health service confirmatory test treatment . Although Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) currently approve six different rapid test clinical use detect HIV 1 2 , OraQuick Advance Rapid Assessment ( OQA ) one administer orally . OQA test conducted geographical location laboratory facility capable perform ELISA assay unavailable . Thus , HIV screen program adopt OQA extend reach far beyond previous location . Despite OQA 's grow success popularity many different setting globally , Chile yet accept OQA rapid test viable alternative ELISA testing . The Chilean government delay approval adoption OQA pending additional evidence among Chileans offer advantageous alternative ELISA test equal specificity .</detailed_description>
