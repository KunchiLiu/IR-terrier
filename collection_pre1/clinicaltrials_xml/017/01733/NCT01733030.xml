	<brief_summary>PROJECT SUMMARY : PTSD debilitate psychiatric condition precipitate exposure extreme , life threatening , trauma estimate lifetime prevalence 8 % 9 % U.S. adult . One core symptom PTSD intense psychological distress presence stimuli `` resemble '' one aspects trauma experience ( DSM-IV ) . This phenomenon refer stimulus generalization receive surprisingly little empirical test context clinical anxiety general , PTSD specifically . The current proposal represent first effort study neurobiology pharmacology PTSD-relevant learning phenomenon across without PTSD . The objective particular proposal apply fMRI pharmacologic method : 1 ) identify brain mechanism associate generalization condition fear 2 ) examine pharmacologic modifiability level generalization use partial agonist NMDA receptor complex ( D-cycloserine ) show increase discrimination CS+ ( danger cue ) CS- ( safety cue ) animal study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects D-cycloserine Stimulus Generalization Conditioned Fear Healthy Controls .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To fullfill objective application , generalization paradigm design psychophysiologically validate 6 ring present computer screen gradually increase size . For half participant small ring condition stimulus pair electric shock ( CS+ ) large unpaired stimulus ( CS- ) , half participant reverse . Activity fear-related brain structure measure via fMRI predict gradually decrease present stimulus gradually become less similar CS+ , form generalization slope gradient . One central hypothesis current application DCS ( Seromycin ) dose dependently increase steepness generalization gradient ( i.e. , reduce fear generalization ) . This study include 3 group healthy adult recieving either 1 ) 500 mg Seromycin , 2 ) 250 mg Seromycin , placebo prior acquisition fear conditioning . Twenty four hour later , participant return complete fMRI brain response danger cue stimulus resemble danger cue assess .</detailed_description>
