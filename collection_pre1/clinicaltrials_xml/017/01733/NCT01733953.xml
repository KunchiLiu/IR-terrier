	<brief_summary>Adult survivor childhood cancer high risk develop cardiovascular disease . Therapies use treat many cancer , chemotherapy radiation , likely cause damage surface artery wall call endothelial layer , lead induction atherosclerosis eventual cardiovascular disease . HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitor , statin , improve endothelial function independent cholesterol-lowering . In addition , statins show reduce arterial stiffness slow arterial thickening . Despite strong evidence support vascular benefit statins many different patient population , medication never study cancer survivor . Therefore , overall objective study evaluate effect statin therapy vascular health young adult survivor childhood cancer . Twenty-four young adult ( age 18-39 year old ) survivor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) enrol six-month randomized , double-blind ( participant investigator ) , placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial compare effect atorvastatin versus placebo endothelial function measure vascular health . Our primary objective evaluate effect 6-months statin therapy conduit artery endothelial function young adult survivor childhood cancer . The investigator hypothesize , compare placebo , atorvastatin significantly increase brachial artery flow-mediated dilation survivor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult survivor childhood cancer seven time risk die cardiovascular disease compare general population . The increase risk think result therapy use treat cancer chemotherapy radiation . These therapy likely cause damage endothelial cell , line arterial wall , function properly , offer protection atherosclerosis . Young adult survivor childhood ALL reduce endothelial function , endothelial dysfunction , compare healthy control . Endothelial dysfunction consider early manifestation atherosclerosis therefore ideal target therapy order reduce risk cardiovascular disease . Interventions improve endothelial function young adult survivor childhood cancer may beneficial term mitigate medium- long-term risk develop chronic disease . HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitor , statin , widely use cardiovascular disease risk reduction . These medication primarily use reduce level total- low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol . Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate statin therapy improve endothelial function wide array patient population . Beyond well-described vascular benefit , statin attractive therapeutic option cardiovascular disease risk reduction due strong safety profile . Despite clear potential endothelial function improvement cardiovascular risk reduction , statin therapy never evaluate survivor childhood cancer . Although statins well-studied patient population risk cardiovascular disease , strong justification evaluation cancer survivor since mechanism responsible vascular problem individual ( treatment-induced vascular toxicity ) differ traditional atherosclerosis . Therefore , objective current study ass ability statin therapy improve endothelial function , arterial stiffness , arterial thickening young adult survivor childhood cancer . The focus study survivor hematologic malignancy , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , since former show associated endothelial impairment cancer share common treatment exposure ( chemotherapy radiation ) , likely primary factor responsible endothelial dysfunction individual . Twenty-four young adult ( age 18-39 year old ) survivor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) enrol six-month randomized , double-blind ( participant investigator ) , placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial compare effect atorvastatin versus placebo endothelial function measure vascular health . Following baseline test , subject randomly assign ( 1:1 ) either atorvastatin placebo . Participants return 1-month 3-months assessment safety ( blood draw adverse event assessment ) medication compliance 6-months assessment safety , medication compliance , reassessment baseline variable .</detailed_description>
