	<brief_title>Stroke Prevention Rhythm Interventions Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation affect approximately 1 % general population , prevalence AF increase increase age , 10-15 % individual age 80 year great suffer AF . Various projection estimate least double prevalence AF next 30-40 year . Stroke serious , often disable complication AF . The Framingham Heart Study demonstrate roughly five-fold increase risk stroke patient AF . The proportion stroke attributable AF also increase age , one quarter one third stroke octogenarian related atrial fibrillation . AF-related stroke tend severe ischemic stroke etiology , result high rate stroke-related disability . Vitamin K antagonists show highly effective reduce risk stroke patient AF . A recent meta-analysis 6 trial VKA versus placebo , 2900 patient AF , demonstrate roughly 65 % reduction thromboembolic stroke . Thus , vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) universally recommend AF patient felt moderate high risk stroke . The CHADS2 risk score fairly accurately distinguish patient low , moderate high risk stroke use clinical variable bedside risk score . In recent year , VKA recommend AF patient CHADS2 risk score least 2 great , optional use either ASA VKA score 1 . Most recently , Canadian Cardiovascular Society 's 2010 AF Guidelines recommend anticoagulation patient CHADS2 risk score 1 great , absence increase bleeding risk . The 2012 update Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines additionally recommend use CHA2DS2-Vasc score patient CHADS2 risk score 0 , subsequent use OAC even proportion patient . The benefit VKA largely dependent upon achieve adequate anticoagulation , ideally INR 2 3 , majority treatment time . However , achieve maintain therapeutic anticoagulation clinical practice quite challenge . Warfarin VKA variety limitation clinical practice . The individual patient 's response warfarin often unpredictable , narrow therapeutic window . The drug slow onset offset action , need regular INR monitoring frequent dose adjustment . There often numerous food drug interaction warfarin . Patients may non-compliant routine INR monitoring . Physicians may wary risk bleed complication , particularly risk intracranial haemorrhage , rise substantially INR approach 4 beyond . Such fear bleeding may lead physician underprescribe warfarin patient increase stroke risk . Adverse event warfarin common , leading high rate discontinuation . As result limitation , estimate half eligible AF patient worldwide receive VKA . In patient receive VKA , 40-60 % actually achieve therapeutic anticoagulation . The adequacy anticoagulation VKA often term `` Time Therapeutic Range ( TTR ) '' , estimate overall period time individual patient group patient spend INR 2 3 . Numerous practice audit observational registry suggest average TTR globally roughly 45-55 % , whereas estimate TTR 65 % require optimally reduce risk AF-related stroke . In addition , variety issue must consider management patient AF , rate vs. rhythm control , drug selection , device therapy , management associate co-morbidities , particular , hypertension . Recently , two new class oral anticoagulant enter Canadian marketplace . These include dabigatran , direct thrombin inhibitor , rivaroxaban , factor Xa inhibitor . Both drug offer distinct advantage warfarin , provide predictable anticoagulation without need monitoring , different safety tolerability profile . It unknown Canadian physician currently assess manage stroke risk patient AF , also unknown physician adopt new oral anticoagulant practice . Recent guideline also highlight need physician assess bleed risk AF patient , something physician perform systematic manner . Thus , new era stroke prevention strategy guideline , prospective AF registry clearly warrant good understand physician approach use OAC clinical practice , characterize patient variable determine use specific agent .</detailed_description>
