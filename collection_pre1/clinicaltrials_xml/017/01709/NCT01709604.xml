	<brief_title>Role CVVH Patients With Acute Paraquat Poisoning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paraquat ( 1,1 '-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridylium dichloride ) widely use herbicide . Accidental intentional ingestion paraquat common many develop country China , Sri Lanka Korea easy access . The high mortality rate paraquat due high toxicity lack effective treatment . Thus , paraquat poison becomes one major medical problem develop country . Paraquat poison also one major cause death among young patient acute poison China . It characterize multiple organ failure pulmonary fibrosis respiratory failure . A grow body evidence suggest continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) great beneficial role treatment multiple organ dysfunction . We hypothesize CVVH might reduce high mortality rate paraquat poison via restore multiorgan function , acute hepatic lesion , acute kidney injury , acute lung injury acute pancreatic injury . We expect enroll 100 patient hospital within 1 week oral intake paraquat . All patient divide Group 1 Group 2 . Group 1 treat standardize therapeutic regimen include stomach lavage , emergency haemoperfusion drug . Group 2 accept standardized treatment plus CVVH . The aim prospective clinical study evaluate safety efficacy CVVH treatment patient paraquat poison . The survival rate , clinical manifestation clinical parameter two group compare .</detailed_description>
