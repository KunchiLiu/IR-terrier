	<brief_summary>Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) rapidly fatal malignancy bone marrow . It treat chemotherapy alone , case , majority case , treatment cure disease allogeneic stem cell transplant , cure rate 30-40 % . In another subset , disease less responsive chemotherapy aggressive form , cure rate well 20 % beyond 2 year , usually rapidly fatal within 6 month . Therefore , aggressive form disease , modification transplant protocol require order try improve poor result . There number area within transplant protocol modification make order achieve goal . These include : high dos chemotherapy radiation ; alteration new bone marrow graft ; alteration immune suppression , enhance graft vs. leukemia effect . By focus one component , one might able enhance anti-leukemic aspect treatment result successful outcome . One aspect investigator , Ottawa , focus initial intensive conditioning regimen , specifically radiation component . It investigators belief resistant disease important use high tolerable anti-leukemic treatment upfront , specifically , enhance radiation component initial conditioning regimen . Previous study suggest high dos radiation might effective eliminate disease , however , toxicity logistics deliver radiation limit use . Technical advance delivery radiation permit safe use high dos radiation . Through modification transplant procedure , investigator believe deliver high dose radiation safely translate improve outcomes high-risk subgroup patient AML . Study Objectives The goal study determine total dose 18Gy ED-TBI follow alloHSCT patient refractory AML result improve progression-free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ED-TBI Followed By Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation For The Treatment Of Refractory AML And Advanced MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale 1 . AML bone marrow base malignancy rapidly grow rapidly fatal leave untreated . Despite therapeutic strategy 70 % patient , 20 % primarily refractory another 50 % relapse first line therapy . Among refractory relapsed patient , potentially , effective therapy alloHSCT , however , long-term survival rate range low &lt; 10 % 20 % . 2 . Increased dos radiation form TBI threshold 15.75 Gy chemotherapy demonstrate reduce relapse rate significantly ; however , OS compromise high rate toxicity . 3 . Evidence suggest escalate dos radiation possible , offer potential increase dose radiation much 20Gy , safely . 4 . Locally , increase dos radiation without chemotherapy demonstrate significant toxicity dose 16Gy . 5 . Therefore , propose radiation-only stem cell transplant would allow u test hypothesis increase dos radiation reduce relapse rate minimize toxicity high-risk population patient AML , result improve progression-free overall survival . Trial Design This single institution , Phase II study examine efficacy toxicity ED-TBI follow alloHSCT patient high risk , refractory acute myeloid leukemia . Treatment Overview Patients meet inclusion criterion receive myeloablative dose radiation follow alloHSCT . Acute radiation transplant relate toxicity evaluate maximum value National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 ( CTCAE v.4 ) , first 30 day follow transplantation LENT-SOMA Radiation Toxicity Scale . The radiation dose lung kidney well total dose receive organ consider independently purpose determine maximum tolerated radiation dose body region . Eligibility Assessments Assessments determine eligibility participate study perform enrollment study , subject sign informed consent . Subjects meet eligibility criterion consider screen failure enrol . These assessment determine : - Subject eligibility entry study , - Suitability undergo TBI follow alloHSCT . - Pre-treatment leukemia activity . The following pre-treatment assessment perform within six-week period prior enrollment : - History physical examination , include height , weight , vital sign - ECOG Performance Status Karnofsky performance status ( appendix # 3 ) . - CBC , differential , platelet , reticulocyte count . - INR , PTT , fibrinogen - Serum electrolyte , urea , creatinine , calcium phosphorus , AST , ALT , ALP , total bilirubin LD - Pre-transplant infectious disease marker : CMV serology , HIV-1 HIV-2 , HTLV-1 HTLV-2 , HBsAg , Anti-HBs , Anti-HBc , Anti-HCV , Serologic Test Syphilis ( STS ) - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . - Echocardiogram include measurement LVEF . - Pulmonary function test include FEV1 , FVC DLCO . - Pregnancy test ( urine serum βHCG ) female subject , unless undergone surgical procedure sterilization post-menopausal ( define 2 year elapse since last menstruation absence contraceptive use ) - A bone marrow aspirate cytogenetics without biopsy molecular testing . Study Evaluations Baseline Assessment Patient test reflect routine clinical operating practice Ottawa Hospital Blood Marrow Transplant Radiation Oncology Programs . The following measure test use evaluate status leukemia prior treatment patient 's pre-treatment organ function . They perform within 2 week first fraction ED-TBI . - History , physical examination , height weight upon admission - Urinalysis - ECOG performance status - HCT-specific cd-morbidity index - CBC , differential - Serum Creatinine , bilirubin , AST , ALT , ALP . - INR , PTT , fibrinogen - TSH - A bone marrow aspirate cytogenetics molecular testing , without biopsy . Post-transplant Assessments Patient test immediate period ED-TBI follow alloHSCT reflect clinical operating practice Ottawa Hospital Blood Marrow Transplant Program . The test use evaluate severity acute radiation toxicity , time engraftment , GVHD etc . - History physical exam ass GVHD morbidity weekly Day 100 post-transplant , four month , six month , one year , 18 month two year post-transplant . - Acute GVHD evaluate accord grade system appendix 8 - Chronic GVHD evaluate accord grade system appendix 9 - CBC least three time week Day 0 ANC &gt; 0.5 x 109/L 3 consecutive measurement 3 day . Thereafter CBC least twice per week Day 28 , preferably weekly Day 100 , 12 month , 18 month two year post-transplant - Creatinine , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , ALT , AST , twice week Day 28 preferably weekly 12 week , four month , six month , one year , eighteen month two year post-transplant . - Tacrolimus level measure least weekly drug taper . - Serum CMV-PCR weekly least 6 month . - Bone marrow aspirate biopsy Day 100 ±30 day patient . Bone marrow aspirate biopsy 12 ±3 month post-transplant recommend , require , patient . - Treat-related toxicity ( RRT ) assessment conducted weekly Day 100 additional toxicity assessment conduct Day 100 , 180 , 365 730 post-transplant use CTCAE V.4 . - Weekly urinalysis discharge 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . The following test perform 6 month follow treatment annually 2 year transplant - Bone Mineral Density - TSH - Serum Testosterone ( male ) - LENT-SOMA Radiation Toxicity Scale - Pulmonary Function Tests ( Flow Rates , Diffusion Capacity , Lung Volumes O2 Saturation oximetry . ) The follow performed time look relapse , indicate ( i.e . drop platelet count 100 x 109 cells/L neutrophil count 1 x 109 cells/L , circulate blast &gt; 0 % , unrelated treatment ) reason suspect relapse . -Bone marrow aspirate +/- biopsy Other test may add frequency test may change depend clinical scenario transplant . The following summary statistic obtain time discharge alloHSCT hospital admission : - Weight discharge - Number unit blood platelet administer - Number febrile day ( &gt; 38oC ) - Documented Infections - Maximum adverse event accord CTCAE v.4 - Days admit BMT Day hospital unit - Days admit BMT Inpatient unit - Days admit ICU - Length Hospital admission</detailed_description>
