	<brief_summary>It currently estimate 50 % new cancer case diagnose elderly population [ 1 ] . With increased life expectancy industrialised country , incidence head neck cancer significantly increase last decade rate estimate 24-40 % patient 70 year old [ 2-4 ] . It estimate improvement quality life treatment modulation , incidence continue rise come year . Because current available prospective study often exclude patient 65 70 year old , data guideline head neck treatment patient population remain limited . Treatment elderly patient advanced stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) use RapidArc® Helical Tomotherapy® dose 70 Gy 33 fraction PTV ( GTV ) 59.4 Gy 33 fraction first disease-free lymphatic relay bilaterally well combination Cisplatin chemotherapy reduce dose .</brief_summary>
