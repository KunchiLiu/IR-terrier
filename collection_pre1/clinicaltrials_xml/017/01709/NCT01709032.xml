	<brief_title>Combination Deferasirox Deferiprone Severe Iron Overload Thalassemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Death disability iron relate damage heart remain serious issue face transfusion-dependent patient thalassemia . However , past decade several report improve survival few cardiac complication . This improvement may relate availability three chelators also accurate measurement iron store various organ ( e.g . heart liver ) magnetic resonance imaging , allow personalize , tailor medical care patient . The chelator characteristic , side effect profile , ability remove iron specific organ differ among chelators , suggest combination therapy may beneficial . Using two drug low dos may tolerable escalate dos single drug may improve iron removal . The combination deferoxamine deferiprone show particularly beneficial reduce cardiac iron , require painful injection/infusion , hinders adherence . This pilot study aim investigate safety oral-only combination chelator regimen ( deferasirox deferiprone ) individual thalassemia major poorly control iron overload assess well chelator combination lower iron store one year .</detailed_description>
