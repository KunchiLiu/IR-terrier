	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Hemoglobin Monitoring Patients With Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia bleed major cause morbidity mortality surgical nonsurgical patient . The current standard care monitoring patient risk bleed serial measurement hemoglobin level . At present , photometric cyanmethemoglobin method widely use technique monitor hemoglobin lab , currently gold standard . However , method potential delay final result obtain . Immediate hemoglobin measurement available portable point-of-care device iSTAT , produce measurement hemoglobin concentration le 1 minute . Unfortunately , accuracy device report vary hemoglobin level , may accurate detect blood loss compare gold standard laboratory analysis . Recently , noninvasive , spectrophotometry-based monitoring technology develop . This novel technology measure differential optical density wavelength light pass finger method similar conventional pulse oximetry . While study report device appear accurate patient undergo elective surgical procedure , recent work suggest accuracy degrades increase blood loss , low oximeter signal quality lower absolute Hgb value . We evaluate accuracy point-of-care non-invasive SpHb measurement utility continuous hemoglobin monitoring intensive care unit setting . If method rapid hemoglobin measurement validate patient risk ongoing hemorrhage , use technology may result early detection ongoing hemorrhage , expedite appropriate treatment , improve patient outcome .</detailed_description>
