	<detailed_description>Background : Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common postoperative complication heart surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Multiple study demonstrate patient AKI bad clinical outcome , long ventilation time increase length stay , think secondary associate oliguria subsequent fluid overload . Studies suggest early renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) via peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) may prevent fluid overload therefore superior management diuretic ( i.e . furosemide ) administration . However , publish evidence suggest superiority laboratory data available guide decision making . Objective : Our primary objective determine early institution PD improve clinical outcome compare administration furosemide post-operative cardiac infant acute kidney injury . We hypothesize early initiation PD improve clinical outcome . We determine clinical outcome well among good responder furosemide compare poor responder . We determine postoperative NGAL concentration predictive poor response furosemide . Design / Methods : The study single-center randomized clinical trial among neonate undergo cardiac surgery CPB plan placement PD catheter due risk AKI . If patient demonstrate oliguria within first postoperative day , randomize early PD trial furosemide . Clinical laboratory data collect compare group .</detailed_description>
