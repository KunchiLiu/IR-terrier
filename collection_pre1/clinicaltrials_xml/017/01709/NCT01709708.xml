	<brief_summary>Migraine impose substantial burden patient term diminish daily function , quality life , financial loss . Pain severity duration correlate reduce measure daily functioning , overall health status . The sphenopalatine ganglion ( SPG ) implicate variety cephalalgia . This well represent literature date back century . Access structure gain via small area mucosa posterior superior tail middle turbinate lateral nasal wall . At aspect , bony boundary SPG . Blocking SPG use local anesthetic relief pain . Unfortunately , many current intervention cumbersome , invasive , expensive . The purpose study evaluate efficacy Tx360™ , new nasal applicator device , treatment head face pain examine economic implication . The Tx360™ single use device design deliver topical local anesthetic specific area mucosa associate SPG . A total 42 study participant accept double-blind placebo-controlled study . 28 receive SPG block use 0.3 mL 0.5 % solution Marcaine deliver Tx360™ 14 receive placebo saline substitute Marcaine . Both patient set also give piece lemon hard candy taste distractor . Participants must chronic migraine history 15 symptomatic day per month past three month .
