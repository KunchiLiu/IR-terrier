	<brief_summary>The purpose research study help scientist health care provider learn prevent dementia brain disease old adult . There urgent need develop strategy prevent slow memory loss brain function decline elderly . In study , investigator hope learn physical exercise brain training program work together improve think memory old adult . Specifically , aim include : - Learning whether physical activity ( like bike treadmill walk Wii Fit game ) help improve benefit brain training program . Based preliminary result literature , investigator anticipate great cognitive benefit Exercise + Cognitive training group Cognitive Training alone group . - To determine whether benefit add exercise occur quickly develop gradually time . The investigator suspect major benefit exercise pre-dosing occur 12th week program . - To examine whether Wii-Fit exercise game cause similar effect brain training traditional exercise program bike walk . Although several recent study raise question true aerobic benefit exergames Wii-Fit Plus , evidence suggest weak aerobic benefit may offset great novelty interest level afford exergames .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Participants take part 16 week Wellness Program , include either traditional physical exercise brain training ( Group A ) , Wii exergaming brain training ( Group B ) brain training alone ( Group C ) . Participants randomly assign group . A comprehensive battery neuropsychological test , survey assessment give prior start intervention , completion 16 week , 3 month post completion . The program involve 4 day physical activity week group A &amp; B . The physical exercise/activity portion involve warm stretching either Group A-traditional exercise ( like rid stationary recumbent bicycle walk treadmill ) , Group B- play Nintendo Wii Exergames television base video game , Group C- NO exercise . Every 4th week 16 week intervention period , participant three group also complete 80 minute brain training activity day week . This addition previously assign physical activity Groups A &amp; B . The brain training regimen consist Posit Science Insight computer base brain game . The Insight program consist five different module focus visual processing , attention , memory . Each module describe : 1 . Bird Safari : This module involve identify order simple visual stimulus flash screen . The goal improve ability respond quickly visual stimulus segment rapidly change visual picture . 2 . Jewel Diver : This module involve track object become hidden distractors . The goal improve ability visual system rapidly identify discriminate object visual periphery . 3 . Master Gardener : This module involve visual work memory match pairs picture . 4 . Road Tour : This simulate drive exercise involve divide attention oncoming car road sign . The goal improve ability visual system continuously track multiple object field distractors . 5 . Sweep Seeker : In exercise , participant identify complex move visual stimulus . The goal improve rapid , sequential eye movement salient visual target , process relevant information make rapid decision identify , discriminate classify target . Questionnaires regard participant mood brain training weekly administer . In addition , brief questionnaire attention memory give measure think memory progress .</detailed_description>
