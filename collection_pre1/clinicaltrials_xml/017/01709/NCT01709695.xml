	<detailed_description>This study propose evaluate effect guanfacine brain activation fMRI 12 child adolescent age 8 - 15 ADHD treat once-daily INTUNIV ( TM ) ( guanfacine ; GXR ) extend release tablet 12 ADHD subject randomize placebo treatment . Children comprehensively assess use variety clinical neuropsychological measure . They scan baseline perform go/no-go task ( well validate task measure inhibitory control ( Durston et al. , 2002 , 2003 ) ) Stay Alert task - new task design measure arousal component attention , use successfully recent fMRI study guanfacine healthy adult ( Clerkin et al. , 2009 ) . They treat GXR placebo 6 - 8 week accordance titration dose strategy use recent Phase III dose optimization trial ( e.g. , 4 mg/day ) , re-scanned perform two task . The fMRI scan conduct use dedicate research 3.0 T Siemens scanner .</detailed_description>
