	<brief_summary>Over last year , number system continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring market routinely used patient diabetes obtain detailed information 24-hour glucose profile . In hospital , numerous factor influence glycemic control possibly lead glucose excursion desire range exist , e.g . intervention patient remain fasting medication corticosteroid vasopressor . A reliable continuous glucose signal could help observe level glycaemia define time-points continuously , make possible physician nursing staff well adjust antihyperglycemic therapy react patient expose severe hypo- hyperglycaemia . In hospital setting , vascular access grant majority patient could well use alternative site continuous glucose monitoring . The aim present study ass accuracy glucose data obtain mean intravascular microdialysis-based CGM system venous blood glucose reference measurement .</brief_summary>
