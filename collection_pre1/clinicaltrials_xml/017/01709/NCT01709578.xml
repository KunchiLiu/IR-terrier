	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To demonstrate sarilumab added disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) effective : - reduction sign symptom Week 24 - improvement physical function Week 12 patient active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) inadequate responder intolerant tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) antagonists . Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective investigate effect SAR153191 ( REGN88 ) add DMARD therapy , patient active RA inadequate responder intolerant TNF-α antagonist , : - Reduction sign symptoms 12 week . - Improvement physical function Week 24 . - Improvement disease activity score measure American College Rheumatology derive component Weeks 12 24 . - Improvement quality life measure patient report outcomes ( PROs ) intermediate visit Week 24 . To assess safety sarilumab population . To assess exposure sarilumab add DMARD therapy population .</brief_summary>
