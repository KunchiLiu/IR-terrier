	<brief_summary>Peri-procedural inflammation associate increased rate post-procedural myocardial infarction ( MI ) , occur 35 % PCI patient associate increase risk later MI death . Statins suppress inflammatory marker MI rate PCI , ≥ 40 % PCI patient go statin-untreated , due part side effect myalgia . Moreover , mechanism action rely post-translational effect , statin must give ≥ 12 24 hour prior PCI , time frame always feasible . The investigator propose novel alternative approach reduce inflammation PCI employ colchicine , anti-inflammatory medication use frequently gout pericarditis . Colchicine may particularly applicable PCI set due rapid onset action excellent side-effect profile low dos , well know mechanisms action . However , data colchicine use patient coronary disease extremely limited , study date evaluate use colchicine patient undergoing PCI . The investigator aim characterize potential mechanism benefit patient undergo PCI evaluate effect colchicine soluble leukocyte surface marker PCI . The investigator also aim determine effect colchicine peri-procedural myonecrosis MI . Accordingly , investigator propose prospective randomize study characterize effect colchicine inflammation peri-procedural myocnecrosis . Patients refer possible PCI randomize double-blinded fashion placebo colchicine ( 1.2mg 1 2 hour PCI , follow 0.6mg 1 hour later ) . The primary endpoint post-procedural interleukin-6 level . Secondary endpoint include relevant soluble leukocyte-associated inflammatory marker rate peri-procedural myonecrosis MI . Sample size need 200 patient undergoing PCI . 400 patient likely need enrolled reach 200 PCIs give 50 % patient enrol may undergo diagnostic procedure ( without PCI ) .</brief_summary>
