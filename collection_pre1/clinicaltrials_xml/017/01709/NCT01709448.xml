	<brief_title>Modeling Study Predict Progression Anal Cancer Pre-cursor Lesions HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persons live HIV-infection greatly increase risk anal carcinoma anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN ) . Despite overall improvement HIV outcomes , incidence anal carcinoma decrease advent highly active antiretroviral ther-apy . Further , substantial morbidity mortality associate anal carcinoma HIV-infected individual . For reason , critically important develop effective screen treatment strategy population . Anal carcinoma similar cervical carcinoma associate infection human papillomavirus ( HPV ) share similar cytologic feature dysplasia . Anal cytology screen ultimately expect reduce incidence anal carcinoma similar see cervical cancer introduction cervical Pap screening . Given high frequency abnormal cytology patient HIV need confirm result high-resolution anoscopy , however , implementation screen program require substantial commitment clinical resource . The workload cost involve follow abnormal cytology reduce cost-effectiveness screening pose significant barrier widespread integration routine HIV care . A model predict patient great risk progressive anal dysplasia need order decrease need excessive confirmatory procedure population . Without model , anal carcinoma screening may remain cost prohibitive many HIV clinic . The objective study develop predictive model identify patient great risk progression anal intraepithelial neoplastic change . The central hypothesis : 1 ) progression early HPV-related anal dysplasia associate environmental , virological , host molecular factor 2 ) possible develop predictive statistical model high sensitivity specificity predict disease progression . These hypothesis formulate basis strong evidence study HPV-related cervical dysplasia smoking , HPV E2 expression , HPV E6/E7 protein expression , high-risk HPV type , HPV viral load , p16 expression , p53 expression Ki67 expression associate progressive cervical dysplasia . The rationale propose research development predictive model allow clinician design cost-effective screening follow-up strategy focus resource intensively test patient significant risk progression . Further , model develop allow clinician identify population patient may benefit early treatment intervention . Finally , information learn research may provide information applicable HPV-related cancer .</detailed_description>
