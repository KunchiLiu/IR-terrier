	<brief_summary>Glaucoma one lead cause blindness west . The disease cause high intra ocular pressure ( IOP ) characterize damage optic nerve gradual loss visual field . Intra ocular pressure change day . To evaluate efficiency therapy common measure intra ocular pressure different time day . Most ophthalmologists admit patient one day intra ocular pressure measure different time . This method mimic patient daily routine may reflect true diurnal fluctuation . For reason ophthalmologist measure intra ocular pressure different time different day . It known method give similar diurnal curve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Diurnal Fluctuations Intra Ocular Pressure Measured Same Day Versus Different Days Glaucoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study physician install anesthetic eye drop color eye drop film fluorescein . Study physician use tonometer measure intra ocular pressure eye . This standard procedure do ophthalmological examination . Each patient undergo intraocular pressure examination 8:00 , 12:00 16:00 . In first day intra ocular pressure measure 8:00 , 12:00 16:00 , day measurement . The day intra ocular pressure measure 8:00 , two day 12:00 three day 16:00 . One month later patient undergo another serious intra ocular pressure measurement . In first day intra ocular pressure measure 8:00 , 12:00 16:00 , day measurement . The day intra ocular pressure measure 8:00 , two day 12:00 three day 16:00 . The relationship two diurnal curve analyze .</detailed_description>
