	<brief_summary>Overall , investigator aim recruit 150 subject hospitalization acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . At two week post-ACS , investigator assess level gratitude optimism , draw blood baseline level biomarkers , gather baseline information health behavior critical cardiac health , obtain baseline measure symptom function . Finally , investigator repeat assessment biomarkers , behavior , function 6 month allow u assess impact gratitude optimism outcomes ; investigator also objective measure physical activity via accelerometer ( step counter ) 6 month . Specific Aim # 1 : To prospectively assess association gratitude/optimism 2 week ACS improvement biological marker cardiac health 6 month post-ACS . Hypothesis : Higher level gratitude/optimism 2 week associate great reduction level biomarkers associate negative heart health 2 week 6 month . Specific Aim # 2 ( *primary aim* ) : To assess association gratitude/optimism 2 week ACS subsequent adherence health behavior know improve post-ACS prognosis 6 month . Hypothesis : Higher level gratitude/optimism 2 week associate great amount physical activity ( measure accelerometer ) 6 month ( primary study outcome measure ) , great improvement self-reported adherence health behavior ( activity , diet , medication ) 2 week 6 month . Specific Aim # 3 : To assess association gratitude/optimism 2 week non-elective cardiac rehospitalizations ( clinical outcome ) 6 month . Hypothesis : Higher level gratitude/optimism 2 week associate great improvement depression , health-related quality life , function , cardiac symptom , possibly readmission , 2 week 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enrollment Patients enrol acute admission ACS . At visit , patient introduce study give follow-up study visit MGH Heart Center 2 week follow ACS . We also ask physical activity level time ACS . On date enrollment , study staff estimate baseline physical activity use Stanford 7-day Physical Activity Recall Scale ( PAR ) . Additionally , contact information ( address , phone number , email ) obtain subject along his/her social security number order provide check compensation . Initial Evaluation : After enrollment , subject visit 2 week post-ACS MGH Heart Center . Several procedure occur visit . 1 . Baseline assessment . Subjects complete self-report measure ass follow : - Gratitude assess use Gratitude Questionnaire-6 ( GQ-6 ) . The GQ-6 brief , validate six-item measure dispositional gratitude . - Optimism measure use Life Orientation Test-Revised ( LOT-R ) , short 6-item rating scale . - Baseline adherence health behavior measure use item MOS Specific Adherence Scale ( SAS ) ask diet medication adherence . - Baseline medical functional status measure use MOS Short Form-12 ( SF-12 ) . The SF-12 cardiac symptom scale adapt Women Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation ( WISE ) study , Duke Activity Symptom Index ( DASI ) function . - Depression measure use Patient Health Questionnaire-9 , 9-item scale . - Anxiety measure use anxiety subscale Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS-A ) . The HADS-A 7-item scale . 2 . Biomarker collection . Subjects also single blood draw ( 2 tablespoon 10 ml/cc ) follow biological factor important cardiac health may modify psychological state . A total 15 ml/cc blood drawn . 3 . Chart review baseline variable . We review subject electronic medical record gather data sociodemographic variable ( age , gender ) , medical information ( severity initial ACS ) , overall cardiac function . 3 month phone call : Three month enrol study , call participant help test accelerometer . We also schedule 6-month study visit repeat self-report measure . Finally , remind wear accelerometer 14 day prior 6-month visit record physical activity day 14 day . We schedule call convenient time participant ( weekday , weeknight , weekend ) . Provision accelerometer : One month six-month visit , mail Pebble uniaxial accelerometer ( Fitlinxx , Shelton , CT ) participant , along instruction sheet technical support contact information . We contact subject shortly make sure accelerometer arrive , wear device several day ensure trouble fit , operation , remember use device . 6 month assessment : Finally , subject return MGH Heart Center Clinic 6 month post-ACS . At assessment , repeat self-report measure , collect accelerometer , draw blood ( 2 tablespoon 10 ml/cc ) biomarkers , inquire readmission since enrollment . We gather additional information readmission participant ' physician medical record exploratory outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient admit cardiac unit MGH primary admission diagnosis ACS ( eligible patient must meet World Health Organization criterion myocardial infarction criterion unstable angina [ newonset angina within 2 month , exacerbation previous angina rest pain minimal exercise , angina within 2 week MI ] ) . ACS diagnosis clarify inpatient care team adjudicate coinvestigator cardiologist Dr. Januzzi need . 'Periprocedural ' ACS ( ACS occur set another medical procedure ; event may occur absence structural heart disease likely represent different pathophysiology , course prognosis 'endogenous ' ACS ) . Conditions likely alter biomarkers interest ( renal failure require hemodialysis , inflammatory disease [ e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosus ] ) Condition likely lead death within 6 month ( e.g . cancer ) . Inability complete physical activity due unrelated medical condition ( e.g. , severe arthritis ) Inability complete selfreport evaluation due inability speak write English due cognitive deficit ( assess use establish sixitem screen ) .</criteria>
