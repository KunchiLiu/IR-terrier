	<brief_summary>To assess effect add acarbose repaglinide gliclazide sitagliptin plus metformin , compare add glimepiride , glycemic improvement Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) participant require addition third oral anti-hyperglycemic agent ( OAHA ) accord China Guideline Type 2 Diabetes . The three co-primary hypothesis 24 week treatment phase 2 , mean change baseline hemoglobin A1c ( A1c ) participants receive either ( 1 ) acarbose ( 2 ) repaglinide ( 3 ) gliclazide add sitagliptin metformin combination non-inferior participant receive glimepiride add sitagliptin metformin combination . The study would declare successful least one three primary hypothesis meet .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Glimepiride , Gliclazide , Repaglinide Acarbose When Added Sitagliptin + Metformin Combination Therapy Chinese Participants With Diabetes ( MK-0431-313 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants come study stabilize standardized metformin dose : may take 10 week , combination therapy metformin + sitagliptin begin Phase 1 ( Week 0 Week 20 ) . If participant already stabilize metformin dose , start immediately combination therapy metformin + sitagliptin 20 week ( Phase 1 ) . In Phase 2 , participant fail achieve adequate glycemic control ( A1c ≥ 7 % ≤ 10 % Week 16 fasting finger stick glucose ≥130 mg/dL ≤280 mg/dL Week 20 ) randomize receive add-on therapy glimepiride , repaglinide , acarbose , gliclazide 24 week ( Week 20 Week 44 ) .</detailed_description>
