	<brief_title>Cabozantinib S-Malate Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose XL184 ( cabozantinib ) ( cabozantinib S-malate ) administer orally child refractory solid tumor include central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . II . To define describe toxicity XL184 ( cabozantinib ) administer schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics XL184 ( cabozantinib ) child refractory solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity XL184 ( cabozantinib ) within confines phase 1 study . II . To assess biologic activity XL184 ( cabozantinib ) . III . To assess biomarker response ( carcinoembryonic antigen [ CEA ] calcitonin ) patient medullary thyroid cancer treat XL184 . IV . To evaluate overall survival study entry five-year follow-up period . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . ( Complete 4/16/2014 ) Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 6 month , annually 60 month .</detailed_description>
