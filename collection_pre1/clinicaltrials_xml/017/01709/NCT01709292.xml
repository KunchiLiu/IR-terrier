	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn vemurafenib may affect certain biomarkers patient PTC . Biomarkers blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . The safety drug also study . Vemurafenib design block BRAF gene mutation . This mutation cause cancer cancer growth . By block mutation , drug may kill cancer cell mutation and/or stop tumor growing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vemurafenib Neoadjuvant Trial Locally Advanced Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration Groups : If find eligible take part study , take 4 tablet vemurafenib mouth 2 time day 56 day . You take dose 12 hour apart . If miss take drug schedule time 4 hour , skip dose wait next dose . After 56 day , treatment receive depend group assign : - If disease spread outside neck , Group A . - If disease able entirely remove surgery , Group B . - If disease unable operate , Group C. Study Visits : At visit , ask side effect may drug may take . Before take study drug ( Baseline ) : - You procedure call laryngoscopy , tube small camera insert nose inspect sinus , throat , voice box . - You colonoscopy history abnormal growth bowel ( polyps colon cancer ) . During procedure tube small camera insert anus inspect large bowel . At Day 28 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You EKG . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Within 1 week Day 56 , CT scan neck , chest , abdomen check status disease . At Day 56 , Group A B , surgery remove tumor . You sign separate consent form describe surgery risk . If Group C , core biopsy . During surgery/biopsy , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) also collect biomarker test . Follow-Up : Your follow-up surgery/biopsy depend study group . Groups A C : If Group A , stop taking study drug 2-4 week surgery . If Group C , stop take study drug . Every 4 week ( resume take study drug Group A , biopsy Group C ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign skin exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - If Group A , test also perform day start take study drug . You also EKG . Additionally , every 8 week ( Group A C ) , CT scan neck , chest , abdomen check status disease . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) also draw biomarker test first visit . About 1 year laryngoscopy colonoscopy , procedure perform check side effect relate study drug . If receive baseline colonoscopy , procedure perform 1 year start vemurafenib . If continue study drug year , laryngoscopy every 12 month . At time study doctor think need , colonoscopy laryngoscopy . About 1 year surgery/biopsy , return clinic check disease come back . At visit , CT scan ultrasound neck , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn test thyroid function . If 4 month study doctor think best interest , need study visit every 8 week . You still blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test local lab call study staff check . Each call last 5-10 minute . If Group C , follow-up study doctor decide disease operate , cross Group A B . You surgery follow-up visit describe study group . Group B : If Group B , follow-up visit 2 week surgery . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask drug may take side effect may . You second follow-up visit 8 week surgery . You CT scan neck check status disease . You option continue receive vemurafenib doctor think best interest . If continue vemurafenib , follow Group A follow-up schedule ( ) . About 1 year laryngoscopy colonoscopy , procedure perform check side effect relate study drug . If receive baseline colonoscopy , procedure perform 1 year start vemurafenib . At time study doctor think need , colonoscopy laryngoscopy . About 1 year surgery/biopsy , return clinic check disease come back . At visit , CT scan ultrasound neck , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn test thyroid function . Length Study : If Group A C , continue take study drug long study doctor think best interest . If Group B , take study drug 56 day longer take surgery . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit/Call : After stop taking study drug , end-of-study visit phone call . You ask drug may take side effect may . If call , call last 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Vemurafenib FDA approve commercially available treatment late-stage melanoma . It investigational use drug treat thyroid cancer . Up 22 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Primary papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) , appear stage T3 T4 image macroscopic lymph node involvement AND require surgical resection . 2 . Persistent locally recurrent PTC macroscopic lymph node involvement require surgical resection . 3 . Patients deem inoperable ( schedule surgery ) eligible trial , could surgical candidate treatment vemurafenib . Inoperable patient must naïve therapy target MAPK pathway . 4 . BRAF V600E mutation detect primary tumor recurrent/persistent tumor . 5 . Total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Patients Gilbert 's syndrome exclude requirement . Aspartate transaminase ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ) / alanine transaminase ( serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ) ( AST [ SGOT ] /ALT [ SGPT ] ) &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN , ( 5 x ULN patient concurrent liver metastasis ) . Serum creatinine &lt; /= within 1.5 x ULN . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1.0 x 10^9/L ; platelet &gt; /= 100 x 10^9/L , HgB &gt; 9 mg/dL 6 . Antiangiogenic therapy , specifically vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) inhibitor , interfere wound heal therefore allow agent discontinue least 14 day prior day 1 . Group C patient must naïve therapy target mitogenactivated protein kinase ( MAPK ) . 7 . Ability swallow pill . 8 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; /= 2 9 . Age &gt; /= 18 10 . Ability provide consent . 1 . Histological diagnosis PTC . Patients anaplastic tumor eligible . However , patient whose tumor contain area undifferentiated dedifferentiated histology may enroll provide original diagnosis clearly PTC , tumor histology remain predominantly papillary enrollment . 2 . Refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . 3 . Known hepatitis B C virus ( HBV HCV ) infection , unless patient clear chemotherapy expert viral hepatitis ( infectious disease specialist hepatologists ) . 4 . Pregnant lactating woman . All premenopausal woman screen must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior commencement dose . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal &gt; /= 1 year 5 . Untreated brain metastasis . 6 . Chemotherapy target therapy within 14 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior start study treatment . 7 .
