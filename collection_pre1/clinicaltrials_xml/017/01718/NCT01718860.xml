	<brief_summary>The investigator evaluate assumption postoperative residual curarization associate impair gas exchange upon post anesthesia care unit arrival longer hospital length stay . Additionally , investigator also evaluate assumption use neostigmine reversal residual neuromuscular block associate increase incidence postoperative pulmonary complication intensive care unit admission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator ' laboratory recently identify intraoperative use intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular block agent neostigmine reversal neuromuscular blockade independent risk factor severe postoperative respiratory complication . Additionally , investigator find postoperative residual curarization ( PORC ) , define train-of-four ratio le 0.90 upon postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) arrival , associate increase PACU length stay . To examine mechanism contribute association neuromuscular transmission failure postoperative respiratory complication , investigator aim evaluate performance improvement driven initiative good understand association use neuromuscular block agent reversal agent postoperative respiratory complication ( see British Medical Journal 2012 Oct 15 ; 345 : e6329 ) patient present PORC develop subsequently 1 ) increase incidence postoperative impair gas exchange upon PACU admission result 2 ) increase hospital length stay . In addition investigator evaluate effect neostigmine sign symptom postoperative respiratory dysfunction incidence unplanned postoperative intensive care unit admission .</detailed_description>
