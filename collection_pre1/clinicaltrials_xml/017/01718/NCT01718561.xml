	<detailed_description>The full trial protocol publish Trials ( 2013 ) Volume : 14 , Issue : 1 , Pages : 347 ISSN : 1745-6215 DOI : 10.1186/1745-6215-14-347 PubMed : 24152537 http : //www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/347/abstract Detailed statistical analysis plan difficult airway management ( DIFFICAIR ) trial : Introduction The difficult airway management trial ( DIFFICAIR ) stratify , parallel group , cluster ( cluster = department ) randomize multicentre trial involve 28 department anaesthesia Denmark . The DIFFICAIR trial compare effect two regimen preoperative airway assessment frequency unanticipated difficult airway management . Prediction difficult airway management remain pivotal challenge anaesthesia . Difficult tracheal intubation difficult mask ventilation may cause serious patient complication [ 1-6 ] . By allocate experienced personnel relevant equipment , good prediction difficult airway management may reduce complication thereby associate morbidity mortality . There single predictor sufficiently valid predict difficult tracheal intubation [ 7-12 ] . However , several study show combine multiple predictor difficult tracheal intubation , positive negative predictive value assessment increase [ 12 ] . In Denmark well internationally , clear recommendation perform airway assessment . Consequently , airway assessment Denmark base exclusively individual anaesthesiologist 's preoperative clinical assessment . It poorly document accurately preoperative clinical assessment predict actual airway management condition . The `` Simplified Airway Risk Index '' ( SARI ) [ 13 ] base multivariate model airway assessment describe El-Ganzouri colleague enable estimation likelihood difficult direct laryngoscopy . The SARI contains seven individual predictor difficult direct laryngoscopy , give weight score 0-1 0-2 . A summarized value SARI score &gt; 3 indicate future direct laryngoscopy difficult . It unknown , whether SARI score predicts difficult intubation well bad clinical assessment . The rationale trial prospectively compare effect SARI unspecified clinical airway assessment frequency unanticipated difficult airway management . The target population adult patient undergoing anaesthesia . Twenty-eight department anaesthesia randomize one two group . Intervention department use SARI score preoperative airway assessment . The intervention group additionally assessment risk factor difficult mask ventilation describe Kheterpal colleague [ 14-16 ] . Departments control group continue normal practice preoperative airway assessment . All data register DAD . A detailed trial protocol describe background , design rationale publish TRIALS [ 17 ] . In order prevent outcome reporting bias result base data drive analysis increasingly encourage prospectively publish trial protocol [ 18 , 19 ] . The argument apply prospective publication statistical analysis plan . Concordantly , International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) recommend clinical trial analyse accord pre-specified plan [ 19 ] . This analysis plan write data collection DIFFICAIR trial still on-going trial data accessible . The data analysis main publication follow plan . The statistical analysis approve DIFFICAIR steer committee 29 December 2013 . The last day data collection 31 December 2013 . The involved department give one additional month ensure registration patient Danish Anaesthesia Database . On 31 January 2014 database lock data extract . The statistical analysis plan publish www.clinicaltrials.gov last data entry data extract data management commence . The DIFFICAIR trial protocol write accord SPIRIT guideline public www.difficair.com since begin trial register www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01718561 ) . The Danish Anaesthesia Database Danish Society Anaesthesiology Intensive care Medicine ( DASAIM ) endorse trial . The trial carry accordance Helsinki declaration . The Scientific Ethics Committee Copenhagen County declare regarded quality assurance project thus report committee system ( Journal No . : H-3-2012-FSP2 ) . The trial approve The Danish Data Protection Agency ( J.No . : 2007-58- 0015/HIH-2011-10 , I-Suite nr : 02079 ) Objective The primary aim DIFFICAIR trial compare effect use systematic airway assessment standard clinical airway assessment frequency unanticipated difficult airway management . Both registered database . The primary null hypothesis • There difference proportion unanticipated difficult intubation preoperative airway assessment base SARI score compare preoperative airway assessment base individual anaesthesiologist 's assessment . The alternative hypothesis • The use systematic SARI airway assessment , registration SARI risk factor difficult mask ventilation , continuous education airway assessment decrease relative risk difficult intubation 30 % , correspond NNT 180 patient . Methods Randomisation sample size Our sample size calculation base adjustment stratification cluster randomize design [ 20 , 21 ] . Since previous record trial 's primary outcome measure , `` unanticipated difficult intubation '' baseline study conduct base data Danish Anaesthesia Database ( DAD ) . In order reject detect 30 % relative risk reduction proportion unanticipated difficult intubation intervention group control group approximately 30 department require 15 month period . Calculations base maximum risk type 1 error 5 % risk type 2 error maximum 20 % ( 80 % power ) . A total 28 department include randomized 1:1 use computer generate list . The sample size calculation base average cluster size 1,611 patient . We estimate average cluster size DIFFICAIR trial approximately 2,500 patient , give total 70,000 include patient trial period . The enhanced sample size allow potentially slight loss cluster accord power calculation , 30 potentially 26 . Our sample size estimation might conservative nature , call cluster necessary [ 22 ] . Populations The DIFFICAIR trial focus two essential element airway management i.e . tracheal intubation direct laryngoscopy mask ventilation . This statistical analysis plan address analysis data regard tracheal intubation . Data analysis regard prediction difficult mask ventilation handle analogous way , elaborate present paper . The part DIFFICAIR trial regard prediction difficult intubation comprise two population ; 1 ) patient primarily attempt intubated direct laryngoscopy ; 2 ) patient primarily attempt intubated direct laryngoscopy ( population 1 ) plus patient anticipate difficult intubate therefore schedule intubated advanced method ( e.g . video laryngoscopic fibre optic intubation ) . The result population 1 2 present one publication . Due extent data , publication present data DIFFICAIR trial follow , elaboration data analysis exceed content frame paper . Adjusting stratification variable Each cluster ( department ) randomize control intervention group , make intervention group indicator . The trial site may account intervention heterogeneity use adjustment analysis intervention effect . Further , stratification variable group department accord whether proportion unanticipated difficult intubation baseline ≥ &lt; 2 % use adjustment accord recent evidence increase power analysis stratify trial [ 21 ] . Assumed confound covariates We define age ; gender ; ASA classification ; emergency/elective procedure ; Body Mass Index ( BMI ) ; use neuromuscular block agent covariates possible confounders , necessitate adjust analysis primary outcome pre-defined subgroup analysis . Primary outcomes The primary outcome measure : 1 . Fraction unanticipated difficult intubation = intubation unanticipated difficulty [ False negative ] / patient primarily ( attempt ) intubate direct laryngoscopy 2 . Fraction unanticipated easy intubation = intubation anticipate difficulty easy [ False Positive ] / patient primarily ( attempt ) intubate direct laryngoscopy 2 . The two primary outcome link simultaneous low fraction desirable optimal prediction difficult intubation . Secondary outcomes 1 . 48 hour mortality 2 . 30 day mortality 3 . Fraction = anticipate difficult intubation plan , intubate advanced method / patient ( attempt ) intubate . 4 . Fraction = unanticipated difficult intubation [ False Negative ] / difficult intubation ( [ False negative ] + [ True Positive ] ) 5 . Sensitivity 6 . Specificity 7 . Positive predictive value 8 . Negative predictive value 9 . Positive Likelihood Ratio = ( Sensitivity / ( 1-Specificity ) ) 10 . Negative Likelihood Ratio = ( ( 1-Sensitivity ) / Specificity ) 11 . The Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve . A graphical representation sensitivity function ( 1-Specificity ) . Outcomes 5-11 measure prediction difficult intubation intervention group . Datapoints Baseline covariates Individual level : 1 . Sex 2 . Age 3 . Height 4 . Weight 5 . BMI 6 . American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Classification 7 . Use neuromuscular block agent 8 .

ASA classification Definition difficult intubation In DAD intubation score program base number intubation attempt use equipment . 1 . A maximum two intubation attempt - Only direct laryngoscopy 2 . A maximum two intubation attempt intubation equipment assistive device direct laryngoscopy use ( e.g . videolaryngoscope ) 3 . Three intubation attempt - Regardless intubation method 4 . Intubation fail despite attempt Tracheal intubation direct laryngoscopy pre-defined DAD unproblematic score = 1 difficult score ≥ 2 . In primary analysis sample size calculation use definition DAD . General analysis principles 1 . Unless otherwise state , main analysis compare two intervention group use intention-to-treat ( ITT ) [ 23 ] . 2 . In order ensure correct type 1 error rate , main analysis account clustered design trial stratification variable [ 24-26 ] . Analyses base individual patient level data cluster patient stratification variable account mixed effect model . 3 . In analysis maximum level 5 % ( two side ) type 1 error regard statistically significant unless otherwise state 4 . Main analysis accord ITT adjust cluster stratification variable . Sensitivity analysis perform adjust unadjusted prior list potential confounding covariates . We discuss result differ main analysis . The conclusion trial base primary analysis . 5 . Test interaction apply subgroup analysis . 6 . Risks report relative risk . When relative risk calculate odds ratios 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) do accord Zhang et Yu [ 27 ] . 7 . For miss data exceed rate 5 % , statistical significant Little 's test , indicate miss data completely random sample total data , point estimate 95 % CI calculate use worst/best case scenario imputation miss value . If imputation worst/best case scenario implies different conclusion , multiple imputation perform miss value assume missingness random [ 28 ] . Unadjusted complete case analyse also present . 8 . In order avoid reject true null hypothesis address problem multiplicity Bonferroni adjustment secondary outcome measure . If unadjusted analysis insignificant ( P &gt; 0,05 ) , Bonferroni adjustment apply . In case adjustment change unadjusted significant P-value non-significant P-value , discuss . 9 . To ensure complete objectivity , statistician blind intervention group primary outcome analysis . After data collection , third party data manager generate complete data set blind cod intervention group variables possibly reveal intervention . The statistician performs primary outcome analysis data set . If primary outcome differs group construct different conclusion reflect result , consider significant difference intervention could benefit harm . After write conclusion , uncover code blinding , subsequently correct conclusion employ [ 29 ] . Statistical analysis Trial profile The flow study participant display Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) diagram cluster level individual level . The number cluster fulfil inclusion criterion number cluster include primary secondary analysis present . The number patient fulfil study inclusion criterion well number include primary secondary analysis report . Reasons exclusion cluster patient primary secondary analysis report . Primary outcome Frequencies percentages per group report 95 % CI . The primary outcome present odds ratio relative risk ratio . The first analysis primary outcome adjust stratification- cluster-variable perform accord ITT principle include patient meet inclusion- exclusion-criteria . A logistic regression include mixed effect model use . Intervention group stratification variable regard fixed effect trial site regard random effect model . The second analysis primary outcome adjust stratification- cluster-variables well baseline covariates assume confounders incorporate mixed effect model . The third analysis primary outcome compare patient control group meet inclusion- exclusion-criteria patient intervention group receive protocoled intervention . That , per protocol analysis control group vs. subgroup intervention group sufficiently register SARI . Interaction test perform intervention group patient receive sufficient/insufficient SARI registration . In alternative sensitivity analysis first analysis primary outcome employ different cut-off value difficult intubation use ≥ 3 instead ≥ 2 definition difficult intubation .

The fourth figure present baseline data intervention group individual cluster level fifth figure outline main outcome result intervention group . Discussion In order avoid outcome reporting bias data drive result paper present detailed statistical analysis plan main publication DIFFICAIR trial . The DIFFICAIR trial raise two important question i.e . possible via intervention reduce frequency difficult intubation and/or difficult mask ventilation ? This plan address statistical analysis population intubate patient . This sample size calculation base population ; SARI develop prediction tool difficult intubation ; due extent data . By adjust primary outcome analysis different design variable , cluster stratification strive eliminate inflate type 1 error rate consequence trial design . A mixed effect model apply base evaluation variable random fix effect [ 30 , 31 ] . When multiple comparison perform two group , may risk accept intervention effect erroneously ( Type 1 error ) . There several approach deal multiple testing . We choose employ Bonferroni adjustment secondary outcome measure order evaluate , identify discuss dubious significant outcome may due statistical multiplicity . The value diagnostic test usually present sensitivity specificity . We choose ( 1 - total accuracy ) i.e . proportion unanticipated difficult intubation ( False Negative , FN ) proportion unanticipated easy intubation ( False Positive , FP ) . Both scenario clinical relevance since FN risk hypoxia , increase morbidity even death , FP risk impose unnecessary discomfort e.g . awake intubation . At time , FN FP take unnecessary resource . Sensitivity specificity difficult interpret intuitively . Consequently , choose present transparent primary outcome . Using proportion unanticipated difficult intubation allow u perform baseline cohort study , base sample size power calculation . By publish paper pre-specify method analysis , hope result DIFFICAIR trial transparent robust possible . Conclusion This paper present principle analysis use DIFFICAIR trial first publication main outcome population intubate patient . Our approach aim minimize risk data-driven result outcome report bias . References 1. Cooper GM , McClure JH : Anaesthesia chapter Saving mother ' life ; review maternal death make pregnancy safer .
