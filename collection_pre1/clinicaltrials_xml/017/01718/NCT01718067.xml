	<brief_summary>Mechanical device increase individual 's bronchial hygiene commonly use assist patient chronic retention secretion . VAKÜM technology recently develop aim improve respiratory condition hypersecretive patient suffer chronic respiratory disease . The aim study assess clinical efficacy VAKÜM technology patient hypersecretion , chronic respiratory disease clinical trial design . Patients chronic respiratory disease , hypersecretion ( sputum production &gt; 30 mL/die ) , reduce cough efficiency ( Peak Cough Expiratory Flow &gt; 150 &lt; 300 L*min-1 ) refer standard pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) include . Study design single-blind multicentre randomize trial consecutive recruitment . Following preliminary run-in period , group comparison make Intervention group use VAKÜM system ( Free Aspire , MPR , Legnano-I ) add conventional manual ELTGOL technique , Control group use manual ELTGOL alone 10 daily session . Spirometric lung volume , respiratory muscle strength , arterial blood gas , quality life record group pre-to-post PR . Perceived dyspnea ( VAS scale ) , sputum volume characteristic ( semi-quantitative 3-point scale ) peak expiratory air flow ( PEF PCEF ) register daily basis study period . Primary outcome change perceive dyspnea ; order ensure 80 % power detect 5 point ( SD 5 ) group difference change primary outcome end study period significant 0.05 level , least 42 patient per group need . The minimum target sample size fix 50 patient per group . An high faster significant reduction perceive dyspnea suppose Intervention group . Additional benefit among secondary outcome also hypothesise group .</brief_summary>
