	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study photodynamic therapy use temoporfin surgery treat patient recurrent oral cavity oropharyngeal cancer . Photodynamic therapy use drug , temoporfin , absorbed tumor cell . The drug become active expose light . When drug active , tumor cell kill . Giving photodynamic therapy use temoporfin surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Using Temoporfin Before Surgery Treating Patients With Recurrent Oral Cavity Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity dose regimen use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE version 4.0 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Quantify relationship measure intra-tumor light dose pathological tumor response . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Simulate light dose distribution within treated tumor . II . Immune marker . OUTLINE : Patients receive temoporfin intravenously ( IV ) least 6 minute day 1 undergo interstitial photodynamic therapy day 3 . Within 4-6 week , patient undergo surgical resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
