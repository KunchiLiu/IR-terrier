	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) common inherit disorder worldwide affect 300,000 birth annually , occur sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) poor detection care result high childhood mortality , malnutrition , illness disability survivor . SCD cause abnormal haemoglobin , compound red blood cell ( RBC ) carry oxygen . Much disability SCD may cause vascular damage breakdown damage RBC . Research high-income country lead effective therapy currently costly complex . The investigator test two different formulation affordable , ready-to-use supplementary food ( RUSF ) specifically tailored child SCD . As well contain energy , protein , essential fat , vitamin mineral , vascular RUSF ( RUSFv ) fortify amino-acids arginine citrulline deliver daily chloroquine dose create novel `` nutraceutical '' intervention . Arginine convert nitric oxide essential vascular health . Arginine level low SCD arginine-degrading enzyme , arginase , release RBCs . The investigator propose supply additional arginine ( citrulline convert arginine ) suppress arginase activity ( action chloroquine ) investigator improve vascular function . Our study test theory , provision RUSF improve growth child SCD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arginine substrate endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase . Citrulline convert arginine great bioavailability arginine . Chloroquine competitive inhibitor arginase release lysed red cell possibly liver damage . Raised arginase predict low plasma arginine level may predict clinical disease severity . The intervention test design target : ( ) moderate severe growth retardation commonly observe child SCD especially low income country ; ( ii ) endothelial dysregulation secondary low NO bioavailability , inflammation oxidant stress , hypothesise underlie much clinical pathology SCD . This study test follow hypothesis : 1 . That provision energy , protein micronutrient within ready use supplementary food increase linear growth , weight gain proportion fat-free mass child SCD . 2 . That provision supplementary L-arginine L-citrulline within matrix twice-daily RUSF plus daily chloroquine ( CQ ) 4 month , compare standard RUSF weekly anti-malarial prophylaxis CQ child SCD : - Increase plasma arginine concentration ratio plasma arginine : ornithine . - Decrease alter plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) concentration - Improve NO-dependent vascular function detect increase maximum flow mediate dilatation ( FMDmax ) 3 . That provision daily CQ dosage 2-3mg base/kg/day 4 month child SCD : - Decrease activity plasma arginase competitive inhibition - Decrease level plasma inflammatory marker If successful large study efficacy effectiveness would need assess long-term endpoint hospitalization , stroke , mortality . Existing evidence suggests propose intervention also potential increase efficacy hydroxyurea ( HU ) therapy . The successful development affordable ready-to-use 'nutraceutical ' food proven efficacy growth promotion vascular health could represent major step forward SCD patient low-income country .</detailed_description>
