	<brief_summary>Diabesity ( Diabetes accompany obesity ) prevalent condition many time complicate micro- macrovascular disease . Many treatment Diabesity paradoxically cause weight gain hypoglycemia . The Endobarrier enable diabetes control along weight loss alternative bariatric surgery patient interested qualified surgery . The aim study assess efficacy safety Endobarrier Diabesity patient Israel . This study include 45 men woman age 18-65 HbA1c level 8 % BMI 30 kg/m2 . Exclusion criterion : use anti-coagulant , use steroid inability discontinue medication . The cohort follow two year patient monitor diabetes control ( use continuous glucose monitor ) , weight , blood pressure , lipid profile , fatty liver ( Ultrasound blood marker inflammation fibrosis ) change plasma gut peptide level . The Endobarrier explanted one year , however monitoring patient continue another year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endobarrier Treatment Obese Subjects With T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current therapy include diet , exercise , behavior modification , oral diabetes agent , insulin , employ control Type 2 Diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , rarely return subject euglycemia , require dose escalation time associate hypoglycemia weight gain . Obesity well-established risk development diabetes well increased mortality . The majority individual T2DM overweight obese . Obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus common well documented risk factor non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . For patient NAFLD disease relatively benign condition , others NAFLD progress cirrhosis end-stage liver disease associate complication include hepatocellular carcino.The current treatment NAFLD nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) weight reduction achieve life style modification , drug therapy bariatric surgery . The Fibro Test Fibro Max proven efficacy noninvasive biomarkers NAFLD NASH large scale study . Transient Elastography measure liver stiffness non-invasively successful identify fibrosis NAFLD . In addition , designate sonography sensitive noninvasive method steatosis quantification diagnose small amount liver fat would miss conventional sonography affect fibrosis steatohepatitis . Bariatric Surgery T2DM In light , bariatric surgery recently emerge one effective mean provide durable , clinically-significant resolution diabetes . The majority subject T2DM undergo procedure remission disorder . In large bariatric surgery meta-analysis publish Journal American Medical Association 2004 , within study report resolution diabetes , 76.8 % subject experience complete resolution ; within study report resolution improvement improvement diabetes , 85.4 % subject experienced resolution improvement diabetes . All bariatric operation result remarkable improvement T2DM although vary degree efficacy . Resolution diabetes often occur within day follow bariatric surgery , even mark weight loss achieve . Resolution diabetes prevalent follow `` malabsorptive '' procedure ( BPD duodenal switch ) mix malabsorptive/restrictive Roux-en-y ( RYGB ) contrast purely restrictive vertical band gastroplasty ( VBG ) laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) procedure . In addition , appear gradation diabetes resolution function operative procedure : 98.9 % BPD , 83.7 % RYGB , 71.6 % VBG , 47.9 % LAGB . Subjects short duration mild form T2DM high rate T2DM resolution surgery , suggest early surgical intervention warrant increase likelihood render subject euglycemic . Recently , publish subject long-standing uncontrolled diabetes non-morbid obesity high remission rate ( 88 % ) diabetes follow RYGB surgery . However , despite considerable effectiveness show bariatric surgery resolve diabetes , surgery yet become standard care subject obese diabetes . In part incomplete understanding mechanism action , concept gastrointestinal surgery endocrine modifier yet fully embraced clinical community yet incorporate care strategies.12 But perhaps importantly , clinician evoke irreversibility gastric bypass occasional report poor outcome label approach `` extreme '' - reserve treatment last resort . Bariatric Surgery NAFLD Weight loss follow bariatric surgery result mark improvement hepatic steatosis . An analysis numerous pair biopsy study reveal convince evidence significant improvement steatosis inflammation occur NAFLD patient weight loss surgery . Regression histologic improvement NASH document bariatric surgery . The `` EndoBarrier '' Gastrointestinal Liner System endoscopically-delivered device offer alternative gastric bypass surgery . The device shield duodenum upper jejunum contact chyme , thereby mimic foregut bypass effect RYGB procedure without alter subject 's anatomy . Pancreatic biliary secretion pass along outside device mix chyme upper jejunum . Based animal experiment clinical observation , EndoBarrier device may provide useful non-surgical intervention treat T2DM , add benefit weight loss . To date , 13 study enrol 500 subject perform EndoBarrier device . In one study , 12 month 23/32 uncontrolled T2DM subject ( 71.9 % ) , able achieve HbA1c value less equal 7.0 % . The product offer minimally invasive reversible alternative fully surgical approach . Since deliver retrieve endoscopically , device option remove necessary without change subject 's anatomy . Encouraging early clinical trial result , support continue investigate device T2DM indication . To date , 400,000 diabetic subject Israel 90 % case diabetes related overweight . Over 50 % patient well control . Device Description - ENDOBARRIER The EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner system receive European Community mark ( CE ) 11 December 2009 indicate treatment obesity Type 2 diabetes . The implant indicated maximum implant duration period twelve month . The intent EndoBarrier facilitate glycemic control weight loss mimic portion Roux-en-Y bypass procedure . The device consist 3 component : implant , delivery system , removal system . The procedure entail bypass duodenum proximal jejunum 60 cm non-permeable polymeric sleeve attach duodenal wall . This sleeve prevents contact food duodenal wall , thereby re-capitulating one major property Roux-en-Y ( RYGB ) operation . With technique , control diabetes accompanied weight loss , need medication may cause weight gain / hypoglycemia may serve replace postpone surgery . In recent paper de Moura et al , Twenty-two subject uncontrolled type 2 diabetes body mass index 40- 60 kg/m ² implant EndoBarrier follow prospectively 1 year . The author find statistically significant reduction fast blood glucose ( - 30.3 ± 10.2 mg/dL ) , fast insulin ( - 7.3 ± 2.6 units/mL ) , HbA1c ( -2.1±0.3 % ) patient undergoing procedure . The study conclusion EndoBarrier improve glycemic status obese subject diabetes therefore represent non-surgical , reversible alternative bariatric surgery . Internal data GI Dynamics reveal obese subject ( average BMI 44 kg/m² ) uncontrolled diabetes ( average A1c 8.4 % ) implant EndoBarrier one year show : reduction 2.1 % A1c level , value le 7 % 80 % subject , average reduction 20 Kg ( represent 16 % excess weight ) , 29 % reduction triglyceride level 14 % reduction LDL-c. After 12 month EndoBarrier remove subject remain follow additional 18 month . During period , achievement maintain This open-label two phase trail investigate effect EndoBarrier sleeve diabetes control body weight diabetic obese subject . Objectives : The purpose study evaluate efficacy EndoBarrier treatment diabetes obesity Secondary Objectives : 1 . To examine effect EndoBarrier model proximal effect RYGB surgery term diabetes control . 2 . To explore weight independent mechanism Endobarrier improve diabetes . 3 .
