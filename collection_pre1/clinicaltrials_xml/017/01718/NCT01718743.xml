	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination MLN9708 Revlimid ( also call lenalidomide CC-5013 ) help control MM maintenance treatment autologous stem cell transplant . Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . MLN9708 design block protein play role cell function growth . This may cause cancer cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MLN 9708 With Lenalidomide Maintenance Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , recover transplant , start receive maintenance therapy try keep disease come back transplant . You take MLN9708 mouth Days 1 , 8 , 15 28 day cycle . You swallow capsule whole , water , break , chew , open capsule . It take empty stomach least 1 hour 2 hour meal . If miss dose next schedule dose 72 hour away , take MLN9708 make miss dose . A double dose take make missed dose . If vomit take dose , repeat dose resume dose time next schedule dose . You also take lenalidomide mouth . The number capsule take depend side effect may . If dose lenalidomide miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make . If take much lenalidomide seek emergency medical care contact study staff right away . If study doctor think need , dose lenalidomide may increase 3 month . You keep diary record drug take . You ask bring unused drug empty drug container clinic next visit . Study Tests : On Day 1 Cycle 1 ( +/- 7 day ) : - You complete questionnaire asks symptom may . This take 5-10 minute complete . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw store research blood bank MD Anderson future research related cancer . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 ( +/- 3 day ) : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask side effect may . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test store research blood bank future research related cancer . - You physical examination , include measurement height weight . - You complete questionnaire side effect may . - Women able child must negative blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test 24 hour begin treatment . On Day 1 Cycles 1-3 ( +/- 7 day ) : Â°Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine ( 24 hour ) collect check status disease . Dose Escalation : If study doctor increase dose lenalidomide , follow test procedure perform Days 8 15 : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask side effect may . During Maintenance Therapy , woman able child urine blood pregnancy test ( 1-2 teaspoon ) every 4 week regular period ( every 2 week , period regular ) . This blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test repeat 4 week last dose study drug . If time study doctor think disease come back , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit . End Treatment Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine collect ( 24 hour ) routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Your performance status record . - You bone survey check status disease . - You bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Banking : All blood tissue leave procedure perform part study collect store research bank MD Anderson use future research related cancer . In addition , blood collect banking . Before sample use research , people research must get specific approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . All research do MD Anderson , include research involve sample bank , must first approve IRB . Your sample give code number . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge bank access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . Other researcher use sample able link data . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available MM myelodysplastic syndrome . Its use autologous stem cell transplant investigational . MLN9708 FDA approve commercially available . Up 88 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
