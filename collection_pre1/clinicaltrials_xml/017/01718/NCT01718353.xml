	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To explore benefit early switch docetaxel/prednisone cabazitaxel/ prednisone men Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) achieve ≥30 % prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline baseline cycle 4 initial docetaxel treatment . - To evaluate circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) clinical response/resistance docetaxel cabazitaxel treatment . Secondary Objectives : - To assess efficacy safety two treatment strategy , switch cabazitaxel/prednisone docetaxel/prednisone docetaxel/prednisone cabazitaxel/prednisone . - To evaluate efficacy patient receive initial taxane treatment switch efficacy alternate taxane switch within initial treatment group . To explore : - Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sequence CTCs ass tubulin mutation androgen receptor ( AR ) isoforms . - Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence CTCs validate RNA sequencing result . - To measure PSA response ( ≥30 % ≥50 % reduction PSA baseline ) patient previously treat high potency AR-targeted agent ( AR signal inhibitor CYP 17 inhibitor ) .</brief_summary>
