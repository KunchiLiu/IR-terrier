	<detailed_description>`` Dyspnea '' refers subjective awareness breathe discomfort typically accompany increase physical activity , particularly patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . In patient , symptom dyspnea contributes significantly exercise intolerance impoverish health-related quality life . Alleviating dyspnea improve functional capacity , therefore , among principal goal COPD management , i.e. , response therapy . Nevertheless , effective management dyspnea exercise intolerance remain elusive goal healthcare provider current strategy aim reverse patient ' underlie chronic disease ( e.g. , bronchodilator , corticosteroid , supplemental oxygen ) partially successful regard . Evidence-based clinical practice guideline recommend , circumstance , pain-relieving ( opioid ) medication may use pharmacologic management refractory dyspnea activity-limitation COPD . Indeed , handful publish study provide evidence suggest single-dose treatment morphine dihydrocodeine improve dyspnea exercise performance ~20 % patient COPD . Nevertheless , little information available physiological mechanism opioid drug contribute improvement patient . From clinical management perspective , information become crucial optimize management exertional symptom patient advance COPD remain incapacitated dyspnea , despite receive optimal care healthcare provider underlie disease . Therefore , purpose propose randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study ( 1 ) test hypothesis single-dose administration oral morphine sulphate improve exertional dyspnea exercise tolerance patient advance COPD ( 2 ) elucidate physiological underpinnings improvement . To end , compare effect single-dose administration oral morphine sulphate ( 0.1 mg/kg , equivalent 7.5 mg average 75 kg man ) placebo dyspnea ( sensory intensity affective response ) exercise endurance time symptom-limited constant-work-rate cardiopulmonary cycle exercise test symptomatic patient severe-to-very severe COPD . To explore possible physiological mechanism symptom relief , measure spirometry parameter , plethysmographic lung volume plasma morphine concentration ; perform detailed assessment central neural respiratory motor drive ( i.e. , diaphragm electromyography ) , contractile respiratory muscle function ( i.e. , esophageal , gastric transdiaphragmatic pressure ) , operate lung volume , ventilation , breathe pattern , pulmonary gas exchange cardio-metabolic function exercise ; employ novel multi-dimensional evaluation technique permit simultaneous measurement sensory intensity affective dimension dyspnea .</detailed_description>
