	<brief_title>Viberect Penile Vibratory Stimulation Enhance Recovery Erectile Function Urinary Continence Post-Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer screen program lead thousand sexually healthy continent men diagnose prostate cancer every year . Recent literature suggest 80 % cancer confine prostate gland . Currently , radical prostatectomy ( RP ) remain best option management clinically localized prostate cancer men life expectancy great 10 year . Despite provide optimal cancer control , surgery lead quality life ( QOL ) problem urinary incontinence erectile dysfunction ( ED ) . Refinement surgical technique improve sexual continence outcome ; however erectile function lag behind QOL measure 1-2 year , quality return erection often inferior . This profound biological , marital , psychological consequence potent men undergo RP . ED inability develop maintain erection satisfactory sexual intercourse activity . ED nerve-sparing RP relate certain degree functional impairment cavernous nerve ( CN ) travel along prostate penis . This neuropraxia last long 2 year . Pro-erectile nerve stimulus vital replenishment corporal oxygen supply metabolic need . Several histological analysis demonstrate decreased smooth muscle number , cell-cell contact , venous leakage , collagen deposition , additional harmful effect corporal tissue injury CN . Awaiting post-surgical neuropraxia recovery , urologist propose proactive approach use oral , intraurethral injectable pharmacotherapy , neuromodulation , vacuum-assisted regimen erectile rehabilitation program . Several study demonstrate variable functional improvement erectile function . Unfortunately , prohibitive cost medication , poor response , pain injectables intraurethral application often lead high dropout rate . In addition ED , significant proportion men surgery develop suffer urinary incontinence ( Stress , Urge , Mixed ) require wear pad bothersome complaint persist month , even year RP . The primary objective ass role penile vibratory stimulation Viberect device enhance recovery erectile function/rigidity urinary continence RP clinically localize prostate cancer . The difference penile length compare arm . The secondary objective obtain formal risk analysis ( RA ) . Other objective ass ease use acceptability vibratory stimulation home .</detailed_description>
