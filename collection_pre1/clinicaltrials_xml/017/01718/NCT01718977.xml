	<brief_summary>This study aim determine whether body weight-supported treadmill training ( BWSTT ) beneficial effect , arm-cycle ergometry training ( ACET ) indicator cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk individual severe spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . After SCI , primary cause illness death CVD . Currently , preventative measure focus around increase physical activity- especially use ACET . However , ACET 's capacity improve cardiovascular health questionable . Research demonstrate BWSTT , alternative form exercise , may capable improve cardiovascular health individual SCI . The study primary outcome measure aortic pulse wave velocity ( aPWV ) show prognostic value CVD beyond risk factor . It hypothesise large muscle mass involvement postural challenge , physical stimulus BWSTT reduce aPWV low CVD risk individual SCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose To determine whether body weight-supported treadmill training ( BWSTT ) beneficial effect , arm-cycle ergometry training ( ACET ) , arterial stiffness ( aortic pulse wave velocity , aPWV ) secondary health outcome ( cardiovascular , autonomic metabolic index , fitness , body composition , quality life ) individual chronic ( ≥ 1 year post-injury ) motor-complete cervical high-thoracic SCI . 2 . Hypothesis Through large muscle mass involvement postural challenge , physical metabolic stimulus BWSTT reduce aortic pulse wave velocity ( aPWV ) 1 m/s individual establish risk ( i.e . aPWV ≥ 13 m/s ) . 3 . Justification study Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause morbidity mortality SCI population . It commonly attribute decreased physical activity level ; therefore strategy decrease CVD risk centre increase physical activity . Unfortunately , exercise-training literature population SCI limit , make difficult design evidence-based exercise prescription . ACET widely use individual SCI , limit evidence ability improve cardiovascular health . Given evidence link cardiovascular measure , specifically aPWV , CVD risk , exercise prescription , capable elicit acute cardiovascular response chronic cardiovascular adaptation , crucial . BWSTT demonstrate favorable cardiovascular adaptation , primarily employ individual incomplete SCI due nature exercise . While preliminary evidence individual complete SCI suggest may favorable training effect , effectiveness large sample individual chronic , motor-complete , severe SCI yet establish . 4 . Objectives Cardiovascular adaptation individual SCI predispose complex secondary health problem . This study use comprehensive assessment cardiovascular risk factor two different exercise intervention assist develop cardiovascular risk profile determine BWSTT great efficacy traditional exercise intervention ( ACET ) decrease cardiovascular risk individual high , severe SCI . 5 . Research Method This study employ prospective , multi-centre , randomize , control , single-blinded clinical trial . A total 60 participant ( 20 per site ) 18-60 year age sustain motor-complete ( i.e. , C4-T6 , AIS A B ) traumatic SCI ≥ 1 year prior recruit . Only individual aPWV ≥ 13 m/s eligible participate . The primary outcome measure ( aPWV ) , secondary cardiovascular autonomic parameter assess use combination electrocardiography , ultrasound , blood pressure , applanation tonometry technique . Fitness determine use peak oxygen consumption test arm-cycle ergometer . Body composition determine use dual energy x-ray absorbitrometry ( DXA ) scan . Metabolic index determine blood sampling . Lastly , quality life physical activity level assess use questionnaire . Measurements take place baseline ( via participation Study 1 ) , 3 6-months exercise training , follow completion 6-months exercise training . Training involve 3 , 60-minute exercise session per week , 24 week . Both BWSTT ACET session take place Blusson Spinal Cord Centre International Collaboration On Repair Discoveries ( ICORD ) .</detailed_description>
