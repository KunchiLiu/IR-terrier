	<brief_summary>The purpose open-label , single-arm , multi-center phase II trial evaluate efficacy safety novel pan-HER inhibitor , NOV120101 ( Poziotinib ) , 2nd line monotherapy agent lung adenocarcinoma patient acquire resistance prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NOV120101 Phase 2 Study NSCLC Patients With Aquired Resistance 1st Generation EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acquired resistance prior EGFR TKIs consider `` unmet medical need '' clinical practice . To evaluate efficacy NOV120101 ( Poziotinib ) second-line monotherapeutic agent , patient acquire resistance gefitinib erlotinib enrol study . Subjects receive NOV120101 ( Poziotinib ) 16 mg PO daily disease progression unacceptable toxicity development . Progression free survival ( PFS ) analyze primary endpoint trial . Secondary endpoint include PFS rate 16 week , ORR DCR also analyze .</detailed_description>
