	<brief_summary>Description : A randomized Placebo-controlled study evaluate safety efficacy Cenv3 peptide vaccine normal volunteer . This study design test safety 3 consecutive monthly escalating dos immunogen ( 0.324 mg , 0.648 3.240 mg / 70 kgm body weight ) 40 healthy male subject ( 15,15 and10 subject respectively ) plus 10 subject placebo . Bioavailability Cenv3 test throughout duration experiment . In study hyperimmune state achieve via 3 subcutaneous injection ( 0.648 mg ) , every 4 week . A placebo treat healthy subject ( n= 10 ) serve control . Chronic HCV patient ( n=50 ) respond IFN + RBV combine therapy recruit test therapeutic efficacy compound via 6 consecutive injection ( 0.648 mg ) every 2 week . ( NB : group patient already recruit first part project evaluation compound currently underway ) . Immunized healthy volunteer follow year compare placebo group , biochemical , hematological , immunological allergic parameter record . Treated CHC patient evaluate virological , hematological , biochemical immunological state end treatment . Subject : Cenv3 potential prophylactic therapeutic immunogen healthy volunteer chronic HCV infection respectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In present work , plan study safety efficacy peptide vaccine term Cenv3 ( C HCV , en envelop , v vaccine , 3 3 epitope ) . The main outline current study include : 1 ) Examining safety parameter throughout vaccination period include acute chronic reaction present phase 1 clinical study ( i.e . healthy volunteer ) . The vaccine administer sc 3 escalate dos presence absence adjuvant . Bioavailability vaccine throughout experiment duration also determine . 2 ) Assessment humoral cellular immune response towards Cenv3 healthy volunteer ( high risk acquire HCV infection ) . 3 ) Evaluation neutralize capacity generate Abs interfere intracellular replication HCV permissive cell line ii ) Objective The present proposal aim : - 1 . Examining safety tolerability towards candidate HCV peptide vaccine healthy volunteer . 2 . Testing cell mediate immunity via cytotoxic T lymphocyte response vaccinate healthy subject ( CMI ) . 3 . Determining epitope specific B cell response antibody titer vaccinate individual ( humoral Immunogenicity ) . 4 . Testing viral neutralization antibody vaccine epitope . ( Efficacy ) . 5 . Studying bioavailability peptide subject ' circulation throughout vaccination time 90 day post vaccination . iii ) Study population Subjects cardiovascular problem , asthma , allergy , exclude study . Also , subject participate experimental medicine clinical trial past 3 month exclude . Healthy volunteer include subject sexes , 18-55 year age enrol . All subject fulfill inclusion criterion follow : mentally physically healthy , clinically relevant pathological finding investigation pre-study examination include blood chemistry ( liver kidney function test ) , differential blood count , coagulation test , ultrasensitive C-reactive protein level . Subjects able provide write informed consent . The exclusion criterion include pregnant breast feed woman , patient chronic viral-infections ( e.g. , HBV , HCV , HIV , CMV , HSV ) , evidence decompensated liver disease , pre-existing hematuria , proteinuria , cryoglobulin level &gt; 1 % immunologically driven disease , schistosomiasis , acute infectious illness , severe psychiatric disorder , current past history malignancy patient receive treatment interferon investigational therapy hepatitis 3 month prior study entry . iv ) Consent The volunteer provide write information sheet vaccine requirement trial . They , return , give write consent participate study . Subjects pay honorarium participation . They also provide transport money hospital . v ) Outlines study : In propose study , aim evaluate tolerability , safety , immunogenicity efficacy Cenv3 peptide vaccine 112 healthy volunteer placebo control open label phase 1 clinical trial . Tolerability safety parameter include clinical sign ( acute chronic ) , biochemical assay ( hepatic renal function well metabolic parameter ) hematological test ( blood cell parameter ) . Both humoral cellular response immunization protocol evaluate . Neutralizing capacity specific Abs generate response vaccine also determine vaccination . vi ) Vaccination Preparation vaccine perform principle Good Manufacturing Practice . The lyophilized peptide manufacture eight arm multiple antigenic peptide ( MAP ) commercial facility specialize peptide synthesis structure modification ( .e.g AnaSpec USA ) . Peptides dissolve PBS make human use . The whole procedure do sterilize area drug/vaccine industry ( e.g . VACSERA , MOH Wezaret Al Zera ' street Agouza ) . The lyophilized peptide store regular fridge , dissolve peptide store -80 0 C aliquot ( sealed ampoule contain 1X dose ) ready injection transport hospital dry ice use . Note : These storage transportation precaution follow early stage study . While strategy would modify commercial scale current product prof effective . In late case lyophilize powder recommend dose package seal ampoule dissolve use . HCV peptide vaccine Cenv3 inject subcutaneously 3 different dos ( 1x i.e . 324 ug , 2x i.e . 648 ug 3x 1296 ug/ 70 kgm body weight adult ) . It note , dose 1X equal calculate pharmaceutical dose mouse experiment , therefore 324 ug/ 70 kg body weight Minimum Available Biologically Effective dose Level ( MABEL ) . Based laboratory experience peptide vaccine administration man ( Tanaka Manns ) use 5000 ug peptide vaccine immunization experiment . The high dose use protocol 4X ( 1296 ug/ 70 kg bw ) therefore consider No Observable Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) protocol . The vaccine administer either MAP form ( self adjuvanted ) supplement adjuvant ( MF59 ) common protocol monthly injection 3 consecutive month . vii ) Sample collection All immunization sample procedure perform Ahmed Maher Educational Hospital ( MOH ) . Subject enrollment , consent , vaccination , sample clinical observation post vaccination do close medical supervision train clinician hospital . Seven blood sample take subject prior first immunization day 30 , 60 , 90 ( vaccination period ) day 135 , 180 360 thereafter . At day 360 subject immunize booster dose equal original dose give subject 8th blood sample collect 30 day booster dose . Each time 15 ml venous blood withdrawn . Eight ml use serum separation humoral response determination , neutralization assay biochemical test . Seven ml EDTA CBC lymphocyte separation EliSpot assay .</detailed_description>
