	<brief_summary>The goal present study ass , randomize phase II trial , efficacy safety Lenalidomide without Epoetin beta transfusion-dependent , ESA-resistant , IPSS low intermediate-1 risk MDS patient without chromosome 5 abnormality . Patients receive either Lenalidomide alone Lenalidomide Epoetin beta 4 month . Responders eligible maintenance treatment cycle identical first cycle , relapse occur unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Subject With Low Intermediate-1 Risk MDS Without Chromosome 5 Abnormality .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label , randomize , Phase II study . Patients treat either arm A B - Arm A : Lenalidomide 10 mg/day 21 day every 28 day 4 course . - Arm B : Lenalidomide 10 mg/day 21 day every 28 day 4 course combined weekly subcutaneous injection Epoetin beta ( 60,000 Units/w ) . Evaluation response end 4 month accord IWG 2006 IWG 2000 criterion . Maintenance : responder continue follow corresponding treatment arm relapse occur ; non responder Evaluation response end 4 month accord IWG 2006 IWG 2000 criterion . arm A consider failure treatment introduction Epoetin beta discretion physician . The patient follow every 3 month 12 month</detailed_description>
