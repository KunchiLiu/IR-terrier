	<brief_summary>Background Surgeons lack routine , objective evaluation patient condition surgery . We currently rely subjective assessment available patient data . The current scoring method Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation Physiological Operative Severity Score enUmeration Mortality morbidity complex cumbersome therefore adopt routine practice . The Surgical Apgar Score ( SAS ) simple score scale 0 10 calculate 3 parameter collect operation : low heart rate , low blood pressure , estimate blood loss ( Regenbogen et al. , Arch Surg 2009 ) . Previous validation study show good correlation score incidence major complication death occur within 30 day . For example , 75 % patient score 0-2 major complication , whereas 5 % score 9-10 . To date , SAS never clinically apply test trial . We believe routine use SAS lead reduction major complication death surgery . We also believe lead reduction severity complication . This base theory SAS eliminate guesswork . Using score add objectivity clarity clinical decision presently base clinical instinct 'gut feeling ' . The score clearly highlight patient increase risk develop complication die flag increase monitoring , high index clinical suspicion lower threshold early management problem . Primary Aim The primary aim pilot strengthen design assess feasibility main study SAS . We aim recruit 100 patient group , 200 total . The primary aim main study establish clinical application SAS lead reduction 30-day post-operative morbidity mortality . Study Design The design pilot main trial eventually : multicentre single-blind randomise control trial ( RCT ) . Current data suggest overall expect major complication death rate target population would 21 % . The sample size future RCT therefore estimate 986 group detect 5 % reduction complication ( Significance 0.05 % , Power 80 % ) . Outcomes Our primary outcome major complication death within 30 day operation . Our secondary outcome ( within 30 day operation ) minor complication , primary secondary critical care admission length stay , duration therapeutic antibiotic , number additional operation general anaesthetic treat complication , overall length stay .</brief_summary>
