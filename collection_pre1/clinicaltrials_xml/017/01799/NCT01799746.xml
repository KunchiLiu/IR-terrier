	<brief_title>Mechanisms Response Diesel Exhaust Subjects With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator also characterize select polymorphisms glutathione-S-transferase ( GST ) gene implicate susceptibility air pollutant . Outcome measure include lung function , bronchial responsiveness bronchodilator , exhale nitric oxide , induce sputum inflammatory marker ( IL6 IL8 ) , exhale breath condensate nitrite , 8-isoprostane , 20-HETE ( 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ) , nitrotyrosine pH . In pilot project , parallel study carry human exposure chamber two NIEHS center , EOHSI-CEED ( Environmental Occupational Health Sciences Institute- Center Environmental Exposure Disease ) Penn-CEET ( University Pennsylvania-Center Excellence Environmental Toxicology ) . The joint project enable center validate research result second population include new biomarkers pulmonary inflammation . Each center recruit , consent , collect data subject . Only de-identified data share center .</detailed_description>
