	<brief_summary>Pregnant woman pre-eclampsia growth restrict fetus often reduce function placenta . This accompany increased perinatal mortality morbidity . By ultrasound possible measure blood flow vascular resistance fetal umbilical cord blood vessel supply uterus . A high resistance vessel occur child severely affect . By immersion water extracellular fluid redistribute back circulation , central blood volume increase . Previous study show maternal minute-volume increase , blood pressure drop slightly . Also increase amniotic fluid record . This interpreted expression increase renal blood flow . Immersion water could increase blood flow vessel supply uterus thus increase blood flow child . The investigator aim clarify examine blood flow resistance blood vessel supply uterus umbilical cord , participant immersed water . Initially , 25 healthy woman uncomplicated singleton pregnancy recruit Department Obstetrics Gynaecology : Hvidovre University Hospital , Denmark , examine . The participant act control measurement water immerse conduct study session . Ultimately investigators seek contribute non-invasive option prolong pregnancy fetus and/or maternal condition require delivery several week term , immersion pregnant woman water hour one several time daily , may prolong pregnancy require number hours/days antenatal steroid treatment sufficient . There risk associate study project team considers ethical implement . The study support pharmaceutical company group economic interest . The project group take initiative study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intrauterine growth retardation preeclampsia major cause neonatal mortality , morbidity later neurological sequela . The condition associate increase resistance blood flow placenta , detected increase pulsatility index ( PI ) umbilical artery ( 1 ) . When Doppler flow assess uterine artery , increase resistance uteroplacental circuit indicate increase PI change flow velocity waveform , see `` notch '' early diastole . In 2nd trimester , invasion trophoblast remodel uterine spiral artery complete . Persistence bilateral notch beyond 24th week gestation associate increase risk intrauterine growth retardation preeclampsia . Even though risk persists , notch usually disappear late pregnancy ( 2 ) . When non-pregnant body immersed water , extracellular fluid redistribute back circulation . Central blood volume , cardiac output , renal perfusion urine output increase blood pressure fall ( 3-7 ) . The change occur pregnant woman . However increased diuresis strongly correlate degree pregnancy edema , decrease substantially ( 8 ) , amount amniotic fluid increase ( 9 ) . The change occur within minute ( 8 ) , transient return condition immersion within 1-2 hour pregnant woman come water . The change parameter significant less pronounced pregnant woman preeclampsia pregnant woman without condition ( 11 ) . None experiment show change fetal heart rate . Because physiological change take place pregnant woman immersed water , several author speculate whether immersion positive effect uteroplacental circuit ( 8,10,12 ) . There publish data Doppler flow measurement umbilical artery uterine artery water immersion . The aim present study evaluate effect immersion fetoplacental uteroplacental circuit healthy pregnant woman , use Doppler flow measurement umbilical artery uterine artery . Materials From Department Obstetrics Gynecology , Hvidovre University Hospital , Denmark , recruit 25 healthy woman uncomplicated singleton pregnancy . Gestational age 26 38 week . All participant normal first trimester combine screen normal second trimester ultrasound scan fetal abnormality . Within last 2 week prior participation , fetal weight estimate , woman fetuses normal weight ( within 95 percentile ) include . Methods The study perform labor ward Hvidovre Hospital , Denmark . If fetal weight estimate ultrasound examination within last 2 week , fetal weight estimate day study . In order exclude on-going infection , temperature measure urine examined participant day study . The experienced sonographer performs examination , Bruel &amp; Kjaer ultrasound scanner , suitable scanning water , use participant . Each participant five recording blood pressure , pulse , saturation , deepest vertical pocket ( DVP ) amniotic fluid Doppler flow umbilical artery uterine artery . All recording obtain study session . Doppler ultrasound measurement umbilical uterine artery obtain pulsed wave ultrasound use insonating angle close 0 degree possible . The Doppler measurement uterine artery obtain approximately one centimeter cross iliac artery . The pulsatility index ( PI ) calculate automatically machine use formula ( systolic velocity-diastolic velocity ) /mean velocity . PI uterine artery calculate mean PI leave right uterine artery . For immersion , regular bathtub use . The tub fill thermo-neutral tap water ( 35.0 °C +/- 0.5 °C ) . The temperature water measure every 10 minute , keep thermo-neutral period immersion . The participant place supine position outside bathtub first recording obtain ( T0 ) . Afterwards participant immersed water , place supine position , measurement repeat 5 min ( T5 ) 25 min ( T25 ) water . All measurement repeat participant supine position outside bathtub 15 min ( T40 ) 30 min ( T55 ) immersion . All recording Doppler flow curve measurement amniotic fluid ( DVP ) save USB stick . An experienced specialist fetal medicine , present investigation , validate record blindly . Any record eligible approval redefine miss value . Statistical analysis Because measurement take , immersion , make patient study session , ultrasound apparatus , participant act control . Data express mean +/- standard error mean ( SEM ) . The first recording , T0 , define baseline . Comparisons respective recording , T0-T55 , do use two-tailed paired t-test raw data . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant . For calculation , STATA 12.1 ( 13 ) use .</detailed_description>
