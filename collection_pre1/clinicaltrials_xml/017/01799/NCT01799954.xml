	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Priming Response HIV Vaccine Regimen Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although multiple candidate HIV vaccine study , yet effective preventive HIV vaccine . This study test 4 experimental HIV vaccine regimen , boost NYVAC + AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine combination . Priming do NYVAC DNA vaccine , alone combination AIDSVAX® B/E . The study enroll 96 healthy participant , age 18 - 50 year . Participants randomly assign 1 4 group . In group , 20 participant receive vaccine regimen 4 receive placebo . Injections take place month 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 . All group enroll simultaneously . Enrollment restrict maximum 2 participant per day , ( 1 ) participant group 1 2 ( 1 ) participant group 3 4 20 participant enrol 5 group ( 4 vaccine recipient 1 placebo recipient group ) . The HVTN 096 PSRT review safety immune response data first 168 hour postvaccination participant , determine whether safe proceed full enrollment . Total study duration 60 month : 18 month clinic visit follow annual health contact total 5 year initial study injection . At screen visit , participant give medical history undergo complete physical exam , cardiac symptom assessment ( include ECG ) , urine collection , blood collection , interview , HIV test , pregnancy test ( participant bear female ) . On Days 0 , 28 , 84 , 168 participant receive intramuscular ( IM ) vaccination ( vaccine placebo ) right leave deltoid . On vaccination visit , participant also undergo abbreviated physical exam , cardiac symptom assessment , Social impact assessment , pregnancy test ( participant bear female ) , risk-reduction counseling , blood collection . Immediately follow vaccination , participant remain clinic observation 30 minute ; participant give post-vaccination symptom log instruct complete . Follow-up visit consist brief physical exam , blood collection , interview ; follow-up visit may also consist urine collection , HIV test , ECG . Optional mucosal secretion collection , participant agrees , do day 0 , 168 , 364 . The last clinic visit Day 545 ; visit , participant contact annual health follow-up consist confirm vital status , collect safety information , report new HIV diagnosis pregnancy . A clinic visit require HIV confirmatory test necessary .</detailed_description>
