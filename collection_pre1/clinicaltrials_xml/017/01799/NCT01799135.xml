	<brief_summary>This pilot study . A pilot study do small number participant see technique work use large research study . This pilot study evaluate special kind MRI scan lung call dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE-MRI ) . DCE-MRI demonstrate much blood flow tumor lung tell u active tumor , well functional lung . As part scan , participant receive intravenous ( blood via puncture vein ) injection gadolinium contrast , dye help u see tumor lung tissue clearly . Gadolinium approve FDA routinely use MRI . The goal study determine whether DCE-MRI provide image response tumor normal lung tissue SBRT potentially hep improve treatment-planning method patient treat SBRT future . We also study final DCE-MRI scan compare another form imaging , call 4-dimensional computed tomography ( 4D-CT ) , look breathe capacity lung . Although research usefulness DCE-MRI early stage non-small cell lung cancer treat SBRT study , DCE-MRI dye injection experimental technology routinely use clinic indication . The 4D-CT scan also experimental use radiation plan imaging lung . The SBRT receive standard treatment affect participation study DCE-MRI scan . That mean finding scan use alter plan treatment way . Additionally , participant undergo routine work-up prior SBRT surveillance study treatment complete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree participate research study ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , performance status , physical exam , assessment tumor , assessment breathe function blood test . We also confirm contraindication MRIs . If test confirm eligible participate research study , begin study scan . If meet eligibility criterion able participate research study . If qualify research study , come first study visit last one half hour . We use first 30 minute make sure undergo MRI scan ( MRI screen ) . Before MRI scan , explain want breathe scan . You breathe small regular breath one part exam . In another part exam , hold breath much possible breathe breath-holds . An MRI contrast agent call gadolinium inject vein arm intravenous ( IV ) line . A contrast agent dye inject body allow good visualization ( image ) MRI exam . You aked lie back platform slide scanner . The scan last 60 minute . You hear loud knock hammer noise MRI take picture , process painless . You give disposable earplug help make noise less noticeable . During procedure , able talk MRI technician intercom . If feel uncomfortable continue scan reason , procedure immediately stop remove MRI scanner . You undergo standard treatment planning session SBRT . This include standard 4D-CT scan standard planning CT scan . As part standard planning CT scan , intravenous ( IV , vein ) line place , receive injection IV contrast . The planning process conduct exactly would participate research study ; experimental way . One two week later , start standard SBRT treatment early stage non-small cell lung cancer . This treatment deliver exactly would participate research study ; experimental way . After first treatment , undergo second study DCE-MRI , identical initial DCE-MRI scan described . You two study visit post-treatment research scan . The first visit occur 1-2 week completion SBRT . It involve 30-minute routine clinic visit radiation oncologist assess recovery treatment , undergo third study DCE-MRI , identical DCE-MRI scan describe . You undergo fourth ( final ) study DCE-MRI scan 3-4 month completion SBRT . This scan identical three previous DCE-MRI scan . At visit , also repeat 4D-CT scan study relate . You also routine clinic visit radiation oncologist time . You undergo standard post-treatment re-evaluation image include repeat PET/CT pulmonary function test . Once complete DCE-MRI scan , study follow-up necessary . However , continue routine follow-up radiation oncologist part standard care . You research study approximately four month .</detailed_description>
