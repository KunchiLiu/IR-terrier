	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) concern 2 child 1000 general population ( SCPE 2002 ) . It main cause postural motor deficit child . During past 20 year , postural deficit exhibit child attribute various factor : 1. neuromuscular function 2. sensory integration 3. muscular-squeletic function . The common point study existence immature motor pattern , probably related inability implement elaborate adapted motor pattern respect task perform . CP child develop characteristic plant grad locomotion . They exhibit uniform muscular activation high level co-activation . Locomotion generally characterize increase stretch reflex short latency low level activation associate low modulation gastrocnemius muscles.. These data also suggest control temporal rather spatial parameter head mainly alter CP child . Even though static postural control locomotion consider automatic process , control require , however , significant amount attentional resource . Within context , amount attentional resource need solicit provide information two complementary dimension . On one hand , level automaticity postural control and/or locomotion subject ' attention orient toward another task . On hand , cognitive cost postural control and/or locomotion , depend child age , , function level maturation nature importance sensory-motor deficit . When amount require attentional resource reduce , postural control and/or locomotion consider automatic process low cognitive cost . The dual task paradigm subject simultaneously process cognitive ( e.g . Stroop task ) postural motor task ( e.g. , stand upright force platform ) generally use investigate question . How appropriate allocation attention perform function cognitive postural/motor task important developmental process posture locomotion . It seem even crucial CP child generally pathology . The main goal present project investigate contribution attentional process postural control locomotion CP child compare control healthy child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Within scientific clinical context , hypothesize : - That CP child less stable healthy child ( control situation ) attentional cost control static posture high . - On basis Olivier et al . 's work ( 2008 ) show adults child age 4 11 postural control well attention orient toward video film ( i.e. , decrease attentional demand allocate control static posture ) , predict CP child stable dual task situation visual sound distractors focus attention postural control alone . - We also predict additional cognitive task ( adapt Stroop task ) , increase attentional demand , induce deficit postural control confirm Reilly et al . 's result ( 2008b ) . On basis , also investigate attentional cost locomotion . Exploratory study dynamic equilibrium locomotion condition . Investigation posture follow condition : 1. without attentional distractors without additional cognitive task ( control condition ) 2. attentional visual sound distractors ( video film ) 3. sound attentional distractor alone ( sound track video film ) 4. additional cognitive task ( Stroop task adapt child ) . Considering goal research project , serious undesirable event expect occur . However , fall may occur accidentally rise descend force platform , static posture , locomotion . Consequently , addition experimenter , physiotherapist someone medical staff present experimental recording . The environment also organize secure experimental room exclude potential dangerous non necessary object . Whenever necessary , potential fall report declared health authority .</detailed_description>
