	<brief_summary>Shortness breath ( dyspnea ) exercise major source distress commonly report symptom patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Due investigator ' poor understanding dyspnea develops , treatment consistently reduce dyspnea population . The investigator aim acquire comprehensive understanding physiological mechanism exertional dyspnea CF patient . This study likely identify important physiological mechanism dyspnea CF may contribute development use effective treatment reduce dyspnea population . The central hypothesis impair tidal volume ( VT ) response exercise CF , set increased ventilatory demand give rise different qualitative description exertional dyspnea compare healthy age sex-matched control . Specifically , CF patient select `` increased work effort '' dominant descriptor dyspnea VT inflection/plateau . Beyond point , CF patient 's dominant descriptor become `` unsatisfied inspiration . '' In contrast , healthy control participant report `` increased work effort '' throughout phase exercise report `` unsatisfied inspiration '' , even VT inflection/plateau .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Sensations Breathlessness Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine sensation breathlessness ( dyspnea ) qualitatively quantitatively different patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) compare age sex-matched healthy control exercise , determine difference explain difference ventilatory response exercise . Understanding progression dyspnea exercise enable investigator well understand pathophysiological mechanism debilitate symptom patient CF . A comprehensive understanding mechanism underlie exertional dyspnea may ultimately lead new therapeutic intervention ( pharmacologic non pharmacologic ) would positively impact exercise limitation CF . A healthy control group enable investigator better identify `` normal '' physiological perceptual response exercise direct comparison patient CF may draw . Experimental Overview : Participants CF healthy control participant report exercise laboratory one visit . Informed consent , medical history screening , evaluation chronic activity-related dyspnea anthropometric measurement firstly obtain . Subjects familiarized cycle ergometer , breathe apparatus symptom scale . This follow simple spirometry test . After participant rest prior symptom limited incremental cycle exercise test . Detailed physiological sensory measurement obtain familiarization exercise test session . Data exercise test address hypothesis . Study Participants : The study include 40 participant total . Of 40 participant , 20 patient CF 20 healthy age sex-matched control . Exercise Protocol : A symptom-limited incremental exercise test perform use electronically brake cycle ergometer accord recommend guideline . The test consist steady-state rest 10 minute , 1 minute warm-up 0 watt , 20 watt stepwise increase work rate every 2 minute symptom-limitation . Measurements Familiarization Session : Participants control participant exercise cycle ergometer low work rate ( 0W 20W ) 2 minute intensity order become familiarized cycle ergometer , breathe apparatus symptom scale ( see detail ) . Pulmonary Function : Spirometry maximum respiratory pressure , perform accord standard recommendation . A commercially available cardiopulmonary testing system ( Vmax 229d Autobox 6,200 DL ; SensorMedics , Yorba Linda , CA ) use , measurement express percent predict normal value . Dyspnea Evaluation : Dyspnea intensity ( define `` sensation labour difficult breathing '' ) perceive leg discomfort evaluate rest , every minute exercise , peak exercise use modify 10-point Borg scale test visit . Participants ask describe dyspnea exercise prior intensity rating end-exercise use follow 3 descriptor : ( 1 ) `` breathe require work effort '' ( work effort ) ; ( 2 ) `` I get enough air '' ( unsatisfied inspiration ) ; ( 3 ) `` I get enough air '' ( unsatisfied expiration ) . None 3 descriptor choose one time . Upon exercise cessation , participant ask verbalize main reason ( ) stop exercise ( i.e. , breathe discomfort , leg discomfort , combination breathe leg , reason ) select qualitative descriptor breathlessness use establish questionnaire . Cardio-respiratory Responses Exercise : Standard cardio-respiratory measure record breath-by-breath basis average 30-second epoch , include minute ventilation ( V ' E ) , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production ( CO2 ) , partial pressure end-tidal CO2 , VT , breathe frequency ( Vmax 229d Autobox 6,200 DL ; SensorMedics , Yorba Linda , CA ) . Operating volume ( i.e. , end-expiratory end-inspiratory lung volume ) derive dynamic inspiratory capacity ( IC ) manoeuvre previously describe . An indirect measure neural respiratory drive obtain non-invasively use bi-polar surface electromyography ( EMG ) electrodes place right parasternal intercostal sternocleidomastoid previously describe . For safety purpose , electrocardiography monitor use 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood pressure measure use manual sphygmomanometer , arterial oxygen saturation monitor use pulse oximetry . All exercise test administer experienced exercise physiologist . Tests involve patient CF healthy control supervise physician . Exercise test terminate base establish criterion per American College Sports Medicine guideline . Muscle oxygenation hemodynamics : Muscle oxygenation noninvasively monitor use near infrared spectroscopy participant . A four-channel continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscope ( Oxymon M III , Artinis Medical Systems , BV , The Netherlands ) use determine oxyhemoglobin , deoxyhemoglobin , total hemoglobin measure light attenuation 760 864 nm wavelength , analyze use algorithm base modify Beer-Lambert law . This data use descriptive exploratory purpose examine relationship muscle oxygenation leg ( vastus lateralis ) respiratory muscle ( sternocleidomastoid , parasternal , intercostal ) , sensory response exercise CF patient . Computed Tomography Phenotyping : Existing chest compute tomography ( CT ) scan , obtain routine clinical practice , use descriptive exploratory purpose examine relationship extent bronchiectasis vs. mucus plug vs. air trap ( base CF-specific CT score ) physiological sensory response exercise patient CF . Inflection Point VT V ' E Relationship : VT data average 30-second epoch plot V ' E rest throughout exercise intensity individual participant . The point VT deviate linearity begin plateau define inflection point VT V ' E relationship . Two different observer determine inflection point participant incremental exercise test examine individual Hey plot . Statistical Analysis Data present mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) unless otherwise specify . Between group comparison ( CF vs. healthy control ) descriptive characteristic , exercise response , Borg rating standardize evaluation point ( 20 watt increment , VT/minute ventilation ( V ' E ) inflection , peak ) compare use unpaired t-tests Bonferroni correction appropriate . Pearson correlation coefficient use examine association measure variable : parasternals electromyography , breathe pattern , operational lung volume , Borg rating , exercise variable . Reasons stop exercise qualitative descriptor dyspnea analyzed frequency statistic compare control CF participant use Fisher 's exact test standardize 20 watt increment work-rate , VT/V ' E inflection , peak exercise . A P-value le 0.05 regard statistically significant . Statistical analysis data perform use Stata v11.2 ( StataCorp , Texas , USA ) . Sample Size Power Calculation : Determining adequate sample size qualitative descriptor dyspnea CF difficult limit data exists population . Therefore , sample size present study base previous study dyspnea intensity rating VT response patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exercise . In study , statistically significant result detect use sample size 16 , assumption : SD approximately 1.5 unit , difference approximately 1.5 unit find VT/V ' E inflection point peak exercise , two-sided test , 80 % power , α = 0.05 . Thus sample size 20 participant present study likely adequate power investigator ' analysis .</detailed_description>
