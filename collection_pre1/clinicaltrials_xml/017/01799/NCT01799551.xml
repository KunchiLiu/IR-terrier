	<brief_title>Brief Culturally Adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND There strong evidence base favour CBT role treat Depression Anxiety ( Embling et . al. , 2002 ; Thase et . al. , 2000 ; Rief . et .al , 2000 ) ) . CBT show effective prophylaxis ( Shaw , 1989 ) prevention depressive relapse ( Paykel et al , 1999 , Fava et al ; 1999 ) . The current evidence suggest Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) effective antidepressant treat depression ( DeRubeis , Hollon et al . 1982 ; Murphy , Simons et al . 1984 ; Simons , Murphy et al . 1986 ) , effective antidepressant prevent relapse ( Evans , Hollon et al . 1992 ; Hollon , DeRubeis et al . 1992 ) . CBT include national treatment guideline USA UK ( e.g . APA , 2004 ; NICE , 2004 ) . However , spite large body evidence suggest effectiveness CBT depression West , little progress make delivery develop country . Cognitive behavioral therapy depression develop Beck ( Beck et al , 1979 ) . CBT focus `` depressed people think perceive , others future '' . The key aspect therapy include , take educative approach , work collaboration client develop insight Socratic dialogue . The therapist help depressed person learn recognize `` negative thinking pattern '' re-evaluate thinking . Clients ask carry exercise home learn new way deal problem ( call homework ) . Modern psychotherapy develop west hence likely underpinned western value . It therefore believe CBT might need modification use non-western culture involve exploration attempt modify automatic thought core belief ( Padesky et al , 1995 ) . A systematic literature search find study cognitive therapy non western world . However , research far indicate towards effectiveness therapy ( Sumathipala , 2008 , Araya et al , 2003 , Wong et al , 2008 &amp; Rahman et al , 2009 ) . We adapt CBT depression Pakistan ( Naeem et al , 2009 ) pilot study evaluate effectiveness CBT show effective ( Naeem et al , 2011 ) . The focus mental health service Pakistan seem secondary care . Psychiatric service available major city patient come see professional around country . As seem logical try ass effectiveness CBT secondary care . However , give deficit resource human financial , well base experience team , make sense evaluate brief intervention . In trial would like test applicability brief culturally adapt CBT patient depression attend secondary care Pakistan . Methodology Objective To assess effectiveness brief Culturally Sensitive CBT ( CS-CBT ) depression care usual . Study design duration This study Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) aim assess effectiveness brief Culturally Sensitive CBT ( CS-CBT ) care usual depression . Study participant randomly assign two group intervention group receive brief CBT develop adapt use Pakistan use series qualitative study ( Naeem et.al 2009 ) . Intervention focus psycho-education , symptoms management , change negative thinking , behavioral activation , problem solving , improve relationship communication skill . One person family involve order improve compliance therapy follow . The intervention consist 6 session , plus one additional session family . The assessment carry base line end therapy ( 8 week ) . Control group receive care usual . In Pakistan usually mean , contact medical professional antidepressant . A number equal intervention group employ group . Bind raters use assess change depression . Inclusion exclusion criterion All fulfill diagnostic criterion Depressive episode ( F32 ) Recurrent depressive disorder ( F33 except 33.4 ) use ICD10 RDC ( base interview use SCAN Urdu version ) , age 18-60 , score 8 HADS , Depression Subscale , live within travel distance psychiatry department approach . Those patient , agree enter study , assess 2 week later , fill baseline measure attend first appointment . Patients ask attend appointment end study period assess . The exclusion criterion include ; excessive use alcohol drug ( use ICD 10 RDC alcohol drug abuse dependence ) significant cognitive impairment ( example learn disability dementia ) active psychosis . Procedure Patients refer study provide brief information study . Those meet criterion consent ask join study allocate one arm trial randomization . Sample size Based pilot study , calculate sample size large trial base comparison group term change HADS Depression score . A difference 2 unit group would clinical importance . Pilot data suggests within group standard deviation change value time 3 unit . With 5 % significance level 90 % power calculate 48 subject per group require , 96 total . It expect 30 % patient drop study . To allow plan recruit 140 subject study . Randomization Randomization perform distantly statistician , list patient accept group . After randomization patient allocate either treatment control arm . Randomization perform group separately . INSTRUMENTS The Bradford Somatic Inventory ( BSI ) ( Mumford et al , 1991 ) use measure somatic symptom . An Urdu version available . It develop South Asia . It widely use . It 45 item . Scores 21 indicate depression . It develop symptom report psychiatric patient Pakistan Britain clinical diagnosis anxiety depression . The BSI inquires wide range somatic symptom previous month , subject experience particular symptom , whether symptom occur less 15 day month ( score 2 1 , respectively ) . The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HAD ) ( Zigmond Snaith , 1983 ) 14 item , self assessment scale design measure anxiety depression . It high internal consistency , face validity concurrent validity . Even-numbered question relate depression odd-numbered question relate anxiety . Each question 4 possible response . Responses score scale 3 0 . The maximum score therefore 21 depression 21 anxiety . A score 11 high indicates probable presence mood disorder score 8 10 suggestive presence respective state . The two subscales , anxiety depression , find independent measure . In current form HADS divide four range : normal ( 0-7 ) , mild ( 8-10 ) , moderate ( 11-15 ) severe ( 16-21 ) . Brief Disability Questionnaire ( BDQ ) develop WHO measure disability due physical psychological problem use extensively research ( Von Korff et al. , 1996 ) . A data form use collect information client . Study sit Trial carry psychiatry department Lahore/Karachi , Pakistan Acknowledgements We acknowledge psychology graduate , R &amp; D , LIRD PACT support publication . INTERVENTION Clients intervention group receive CBT intervention use manual . Intervention develop use primary secondary care use series qualitative study ( Naeem et al , 2010 , Naeem et al c , 2009 , Naeem et al , 2009 , Naeem et al , press ) last 5 year Pakistan proven effective pilot study ( Naeem et al , 2011 ) . Intervention consist 6 session focus psycho-education , symptoms management , change negative thinking , problem solving , improve relationship communication skill . One person family involve facilitator . Withdrawals dropout During work Pakistan modify CBT use Pakistan , notice patient frequently drop therapy . We incorporate technique address issue therapy manual , improved drop rate . These include give patient direct number ( mobile phone wireless phone ) , contact twice week remind homework attend follow session , speak client 's language minimum number English term establish good rapport trust relationship session . However , risk dropout remain high . Therefore , employ high number client study , probable dropout rate 30 % . Data entry analysis Statistical analysis would carry use intention treat . Analyses carry use SPSS v16 . Both parametric non parametric test carry appropriate compare group . An analysis covariance use measure difference two group three time point , data normally distribute . A test use compare group , pair unpaired . SPSS frequency descriptive command use measure descriptive statistic . SPSS explore command use measure normality data , use histogram Kolmorogov Smirnov test . If therapy prove effective control , also use binary logistic regression analysis explore factor predict good outcome . An intention treat analysis perform . Number Needed Treat ( NNT ) calculate assist clinician clinical decision making . Research clinically naturalistic setting It recognize research likely provide result relevant routine clinical practice ; current study provide rigorous evaluation intervention provide current service Pakistan extra cost .</detailed_description>
