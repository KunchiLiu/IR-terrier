	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease common cause mortality morbidity worldwide . Recently , grow body evidence identify Vitamin D deficiency potential risk factor cardiovascular disease . Therefore , increase interest explore mechanism vitamin D deficiency affect cardiovascular system . The investigator want examine relationship serum vitamin D level coagulation status subject . The applied calibrate automated thrombogram ( CAT ) ass thrombin generation plasma measure overall thrombotic activity , thus suggest mechanism may explain link vitamin D deficiency cardiovascular disease . Our study population go include 100 patient internal department Emek hospital , present chest pain without acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . The investigator take blood sample subject measure serum vitamin D level generation thrombin . The patient divide four group accord level vitamin D evaluate effect vitamin D level blood coagulability thrombotic activity patient .</brief_summary>
