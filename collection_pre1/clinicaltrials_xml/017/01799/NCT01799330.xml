	<brief_summary>The two hypothesis test study : 1 . The administration transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation ( TCEMS ) completion conventional exercise training pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) result improvement exercise tolerance , functional status symptom patient stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) achieve PR alone . 2 . TCEMS improve exercise tolerance , functional status symptom even among COPD patient fail make gain exercise tolerance participate conventional PR due debilitation and/or mark cardio-respiratory impairment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although substantial body evidence support existence skeletal muscle dysfunction COPD benefit PR patient , role TCEMS routine rehabilitative strategy patient COPD yet establish . The study propose research build knowledge gain previous study TCEMS investigate whether TCEMS add beneficial effect PR exercise capacity muscle function among outpatient stable COPD , assess first time whether TCEMS improve exercise tolerance functional status among COPD patient unable make gain follow conventional outpatient PR . Thus , propose study may provide novel strategy rehabilitation patient chronic lung disease . The two specific aim propose study : 1 . Determine whether administration TCEMS conventional exercise training PR lead add gain muscle strength , exercise capacity , dyspnea health status , determine TCEMS consider additional routine method outpatient PR program . 2 . Determine whether patient unable improve exercise tolerance conventional exercise training PR achieve gain muscle strength , exercise tolerance , dyspnea , health status follow TCEMS use alternate rehabilitative strategy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pulmonary function test criterion consistent diagnosis COPD include forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) &lt; 65 % predict , FEV1/FVC ( force vital capacity ) ratio &lt; 70 % , lung hyperinflation base residual volume total lung capacity ( RV/TLC ) ratio &gt; 120 % predict reduced diffusing capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO &lt; 70 % predict ) . Selfreported exercise limitation despite pharmacologic treatment . Otherwise medically stable . Women minority also recruit . Only person able give fully inform consent enrol study . Patients exclude study participation history uncontrolled cardiovascular disease ( include ventricular arrhythmia , myocardial infarction within 1 year , unstable angina , cardiac pacemaker implant electrical device , uncontrolled arrhythmia , unstable blood pressure ) , neuromuscular disease ( include stroke ) , debilitate joint disease amputation preclude exercise contraindication participate outpatient PR ( include unstable bone fracture , syncope unclear etiology cancer undergo active chemotherapy ) , pregnant . Persons history seizure disorder , intracranial clip skin problem would prevent safe proper placement electrode need electrical stimulation leg muscle exclude , base prior clinical study TCEMS nonCOPD population . Patients also exclude study participation undergone formal PR within 1 year date study inclusion . No patient recruit `` vulnerable patient population '' , include economically educationally disadvantage mentally disabled person , child , prisoner .</criteria>
