	<brief_summary>This study evaluate response rate MLN8237 patient histologically confirm clinically suspect metastatic neuroendocrine prostate cancer ( NEPC ) . MLN8237 orally administer Aurora kinase A inhibitor demonstrate broad antitumor activity vitro vivo . In preclinical model , aurora kinase inhibition result dramatic preferential anti-tumor activity NEPC suppression neuroendocrine marker expression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial MLN8237 Patients With Metastatic Castrate Resistant Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-institutional single-arm , open-label Phase 2 trial evaluate MLN8237 patient histologically confirm clinically suspect metastatic neuroendocrine prostate cancer . Subjects treat MLN8237 50 mg twice daily 7 day repeat every 21 day . Individual dose reduction make basis AEs observe . Therapy continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity result MLN8237 , withdrawal patient consent . Patients follow history , physical , blood test visit monitor toxicity . Response progression evaluate CT/MRI scan bone scan every 3 cycle determine use RECIST v1.1 . PSA serum chromogranin A NSE follow every cycle . CTC count CellSearch perform baseline , 4-6 week , upon progression . Patients follow survival endpoint follow completion study death .</detailed_description>

Other patient require surgical ongoing chemical castration , baseline testosterone level &lt; 50ng/dL . Patients capable fathering child must agree use effective method contraception duration trial continue use 4 month last dose study drug Subjects must able take oral medication maintain fast require 2 hour 1 hour MLN8237 administration . ANC &gt; 1500/mm³ , platelet &gt; 100,000/mm³ , Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL . Values must obtain without need myeloid growth factor platelet transfusion support within 14 day , however , erythrocyte growth factor allow per publish ASCO guideline . Total bilirubin ≤ ULN , SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN . AST and/or ALT may 5X ULN know liver metastasis provide bilirubin normal . Adequate renal function define serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN . If creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN , calculate measure creatinine clearance must ≥ 40 mL/minute ( CockcroftGault ) .

Requirement constant administration proton pump inhibitor , H2 antagonist , pancreatic enzyme . Intermittent us antacid H2 antagonist allow ( see section 5.5 ) Severe uncontrolled systemic infection Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . Patient receive investigational drug 14 day enrollment Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , include uncontrolled diabetes , malabsorption , resection pancreas upper small bowel , requirement pancreatic enzyme , condition would modify small bowel absorption oral medication , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment study . Currently active malignancy exclude control nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider NOT `` currently active '' malignancy complete necessary therapy consider physician less 30 % risk relapse . Treatment enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug phenytoin , carbamazepine phenobarbital , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine St. John 's wort within 14 day prior first dose MLN8237 study Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , hepatitis B , hepatitis C. Testing require absence clinical finding suspicion .</criteria>
