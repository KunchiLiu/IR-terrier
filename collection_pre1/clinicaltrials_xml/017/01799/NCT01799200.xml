	<brief_summary>The primary objective study investigate factor hypothesize influence prevalence hip pathomorphology ( femoroacetabular impingement , dysplasia ) young adult . To complete objective , quantify prevalence radiographic measure indicative hip pathomorphology collegiate athletes age-matched control . This data allow u test main hypothesis , prevalence hip pathomorphology high collegiate athlete age-matched control . To elucidate factor may increase prevalence hip pathomorphology , correlate radiographic measure sport involvement history , hip function demographic , collect mean questionnaire . The secondary objective study determine physical exam ( range motion , impingement test ) could use screen radiographic measure hip pathomorphology athlete age-matched control . To complete objective , correlate range physical exam result radiographic measure determine exam 's sensitivity specificity detect abnormal morphology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview Hip Pathomorphology . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) hip loss articular cartilage load bear area joint . OA affect one six adult , hip OA affect 9 million US citizen . Abnormal bony morphology femur and/or acetabulum ( herein call pathomorphology ) believe initiate damage articular cartilage acetabular labrum may predispose hip early OA . This study focus two type hip pathomorphology : femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI ) acetabular dysplasia . FAI characterize reduced clearance femoral head acetabulum due femoral head/neck asphericity ( cam FAI ) , acetabular overcoverage ( pincer FAI ) , combination two ( mixed FAI ) . Dysplasia characterize shallow maloriented acetabulum . Elevated Risk Hip Pathomorphology Athletes . Hip pathomorphology common cause hip pain athlete , limit end sport participation . Collegiate professional athlete consider high risk symptomatic FAI dysplasia due demand place hip repetitive sport-specific motion . Sports require supra-physiologic hip motion may cause underlie bony abnormality become symptomatic initiating and/or aggravate chondrolabral damage . For example , hockey require repetitive hip flexion internal rotation hypothesize lead increase incidence pain related FAI . Athletes also consider high risk development symptomatic FAI hypothesize high prevalence underlie bony abnormality . Radiographic finding consistent hip pathomorphology present symptomatic patient also asymptomatic individual . In general population , previous estimate prevalence 15-30 % FAI 6-7 % dysplasia . It hypothesize prevalence FAI athletes may much high , prevalence dysplasia equivalent . High physical demand critical stage hip development beyond may initiate remodeling , lead abnormality consistent FAI . This remodel hypothesize occur dysplasia , investigate . Diagnosis Treatment Hip Pathomorphology . Arthroscopic open surgical treatment symptomatic FAI dysplasia seek reduce pain , improve function prevent/delay osteoarthritis restore normal joint morphology . If surgery perform radiographic evidence osteoarthritis exists , professional athlete return pre-surgery level play . For example , 28 hockey player underwent arthroscopic treatment FAI return sport mean 3.8 month . Interestingly , already develop arthritis experienced delay treatment onset hip pain delay return sport . Thus , early diagnosis prompt treatment may important optimize clinical outcome facilitate return sport athletic patient . While timeliness proper diagnosis continue improve , misdiagnosis occur clinician familiar hip pathomorphology . For example , prior diagnose FAI , many patient consult multiple health-care provider even undergo unnecessary surgical procedure . Even professional athlete treat immediately , average time onset symptom treatment report 29.6 month . Motivation . While study support prophylactic treatment abnormal bony morphology asymptomatic hip , symptomatic hip could benefit early treatment prevent chondrolabral damage . The overall goal study improve diagnosis timeliness treatment hip pathomorphology 1 ) identify `` at-risk '' population 2 ) determine physical exam could use screen member `` at-risk '' population underlie abnormality .</detailed_description>
