	<brief_summary>Irreversible electroporation new , minimal-invasive image-guided treatment treat tumor near around vulnerable structure , central liver tumor . To investigate safety efficacy IRE treatment colorectal liver metastasis , patient resectable colorectal liver metastasis undergo IRE resection metastases session . After resection , specimen examine macroscopically determine vitality use specific vitality staining ( triphenyl-tetrazoliumchloride ) visualize exact ablation zone . Subsequently , histopathologic examination use determine type cell death microscopic ablation zone . The investigator hypothesize IRE safe effective method treat colorectal liver metastasis cell damage cell death demonstrate soon 1 hour procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot-study : Non-thermal Ablation Using Irreversible Electroporation Treat Colorectal Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot-study design determine safety IRE use NanoKnife colorectal liver metastasis . Secondary , feasibility , histological effect ablate cell exact shape size ablate area determine . Study design : Patients resectable CRLM ( 1 lesion ) undergo surgical resection metastasis receive study information participate pilot-study . Limited extrahepatic disease contra-indicated . Patients undergo general pre-procedural work-up : total body FDG PET-CT , ceCT abdomen , anesthetic review special attention cardiac history , baseline full blood examination , urea electrolyte , renal function test , liver enzymes coagulation profile test . The procedure conduct general anaesthesia muscle relaxant prevent patient motion epidural analgesia . A laparotomy perform surgeon 's discretion optimal liver exposure . Intraoperative ultrasonography ( IOUS ) carry experienced interventional radiologist exact evaluation maximum diameter , number location lesion confirm resectability ( lesion prove resectable , RFA perform accord standard care ) . All lesion biopsied . The electrode place ultrasound guidance accord manufacturer 's guideline lesion eligible resection . After correct placement electrode lesion ablate accord protocol ECG synchronization ablation zone determine US . During procedure cardiac rhythm closely monitor defibrillator present time . After IOUS confirmation complete ablation ( least 30 minute ablation lesion ) surgeon perform partial liver resection / metastasectomy include ablated lesion surgical procedure end usual . After treatment lesion NanoKnife resection ( RFA unresectable CRLM indicate ) , blood sample draw determine renal function liver enzymes since cell destruction may cause biochemical abnormality . The resected specimen transport department pathology . After section , specimen photograph extensively determine exact shape size ablate area . One slice stain vitality-staining ( TTC ) , macroscopically distinguish viable nonviable tissue . After formalin fixation , specimen stain examined light microscopy accord standard protocol determine radicality resection margin . Additionally , special attention give indication cellular damage , vessel wall damage size shape ablation zone . Caspase-3 BAX/BCL-2 analysis perform investigate induction apoptosis . The result compare result biopsy take prior ablation . On day one day three post-operatively regular blood sample draw , include liver enzymes renal function test . After discharge , hospital follow-up accord liver surgery protocol . The investigator aim include 10 patient pilot study . Monitoring : An independent monitor ( quality officer ) monitor study data accord Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) . The informed consent select individual participant check . Source Data verification perform onsite monitoring ( verify data Case Report Form accordance source data ) . The intensity verification relation risk associate intervention investigate . Data mean checked informed consent form , in- exclusion criterion primary outcome . The monitor also verify ( S ) AE 's SUSAR 's report adequately within time determined legal rule regulation .</detailed_description>
