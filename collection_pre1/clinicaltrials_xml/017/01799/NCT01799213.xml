	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) recognize major health problem . It number one cause low extremity disability significant deleterious effect quality life . While numerous therapy available knee OA , limited efficacy . Of particular concern , widespread use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) disorder . Veterans , group , high risk gastrointestinal cardiovascular NSAID-induced complication . In study investigator propose examine whether replace NSAIDs cognitive behavioral therapy deliver telephone effective strategy Veterans knee OA . Telephone-administered therapy particularly appeal since Veterans knee OA likely limit mobility .

	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) major cause disability among Veterans primary indication knee replacement VA. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) commonly prescribed medication knee OA . Though short-term study demonstrate NSAIDs effective placebo acetaminophen , long-term data support use . This concern , long-term use NSAIDs associate significant morbidity mortality . Guidelines publish improve safe use NSAIDs ; however , adherence evidence-based recommendation low VA . There therefore important need determine long-term use NSAIDs offer incremental benefit safer alternative . This especially true Veterans , population high risk NSAID-induced toxicity . Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) effective safe treatment alternative OA . This modality become increasingly available VA treatment chronic pain well chronic disorder depression , post-traumatic stress disorder insomnia . CBT successfully administer telephone thus stand benefit Veterans live remote area limit access hospital community-based outpatient clinic . In study , investigator propose conduct 2-phase randomize withdrawal trial ( RWT ) . The trial focus recruit Veterans knee OA use NSAIDs least 3 month . In first phase study , 544 Veterans knee OA randomize continue NSAIDs placebo 4 week . This double-blind phase enable u infer whether placebo non-inferior continue NSAID use . In second phase , subject NSAIDs group continue NSAIDs placebo stop take placebo participate 10-week CBT program . The second , single-blind , phase allow u infer whether CBT non-inferior NSAIDs . All study data collect telephone thus enable Veterans difficulty arrange transportation VA participate . The investigator test between-group difference knee pain measure use well-validated Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( primary outcome ) 4 14 week . The investigator also test group difference low extremity disability , subject ' global impression change use co-therapies ( secondary outcome ) . As recommended non-inferiority trial , investigator perform intent treat per protocol analysis . Lastly , investigator estimate potential cost-effectiveness CBT protocol compare continue NSAID use . Though would ideal subject randomize active study drug continue current NSAID , VA pharmacy formulate multiple different active drug maintain blind possible . Therefore , investigator include 2-week run-in period study subject replace NSAID meloxicam . Meloxicam chosen study drug commonly prescribe investigator ' center favorable safety profile compare NSAIDS . If successful , trial improve quality care deliver Veterans chronic knee pain due OA . The proposed strategy particularly appeal replaces widespread use NSAIDs safer alternative , enable delivery care Veterans limit access , likely cost saving .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects include discontinuation trial NSAIDs appropriate : 1 ) Veterans knee pain despite NSAID use and/or 2 ) Veterans relatively high risk NSAID toxicity 5559 ascertain meet 1 follow 4 criterion : Answer affirmatively question : `` Do knee pain day past 3 month ? '' Have 1 risk factor NSAIDinduced nephrotoxicity ( age great 60 year , atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , current diuretic use , chronic renal insufficiency , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association class III . Note , Class III IV exclude ) . Have 1 risk factor NSAIDinduced gastrointestinal toxicity ( history peptic ulcer disease , age &gt; 65 year , concurrent use daily ASA corticosteroid ) , currently gastroprotective agent . Have 1 risk factor NSAIDinduced cardiovascular toxicity ( prevalent cardiovascular disease , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes , smoking , family history early heart disease age great 55 year woman ) . In addition , subject must : Be age 20 year old . While usual cut knee OA approximately 40 year , investigator choose low age cutoff young Veterans higher expect risk OA ( see B.1 ) . Have radiographic evidence knee OA report VistA electronic system . Be use NSAID ( daily ASA ) knee pain day month least past 3 month . Be able understand speak English telephone . Be willing engage CBT program , discontinue ( replace ) NSAID , restrict cotherapies acetaminophen 14 week . Subjects desire escalation analgesic current level knee pain determine endorsement follow statement : `` Is knee pain bad enough want talk doctor take strong pain medication ? '' Current use opioids and/or Celebrex . Current use NSAID ( include ASA ) painful condition addition knee OA . Contraindications chronic NSAID use : current use warfarin antiplatelet agent ASA , allergy NSAID , active upper gastrointestinal ulceration previous 30 day , upper gastrointestinal bleeding past year , history gastroduodenal perforation obstruction , cardiovascular event within past 6 month ( myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular event , coronaryartery bypass graft , invasive coronary revascularisation , newonset angina ) , severe congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association class IIIIV ) , evidence serious anemia , hepatic , renal ( include nephrotic syndrome ) , blood coagulation disorder , pregnancy . ***Though investigator propose RWT thus initiate NSAID therapy would appropriate continue NSAIDs ( even prescribe ) highrisk patient . The investigator acknowledge exclusion criterion limit generalizability , investigator feel justified ensure subject ' safety . *** Previous hyaluronic acid knee injection ( within 6 month ) corticosteroid knee injection ( within 3 month ) . Scheduled knee hyaluronic acid corticosteroid injection , arthroscopy , knee surgery . Comorbid condition include follow : know cause arthritis ( infectious arthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , connective tissue disease , psoriatic arthritis ) , gout pseudogout attack within last 12 month , peripheral neuropathy cardiopulmonary disease limit walk knee pain , bone metastasis Paget 's disease involve low extremity , history drug alcohol abuse within past 2 year , bilateral knee replacement knee pain replace knee . Current involvement litigation receive workman 's compensation . Hearing , cognitive impairment mental illness , determine chart review would preclude participation CBT program . For Women Childbearing Age : Must currently pregnant , agree avoid get pregnant course study inform study team pregnancy occur time study participation . Previous meloxicam use discontinue due lack effective symptom relief Contraindications prolong NSAID use , per PI discretion .</criteria>
