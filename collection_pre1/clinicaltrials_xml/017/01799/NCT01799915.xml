	<brief_summary>Synucleinopathies group rare diseases associate worsen neurological deficit abnormal accumulation protein α-synuclein nervous system . Onset usually late adulthood age 50 old . Usually , synucleinopathies present clinically slowness movement , coordination difficulty mild cognitive impairment . Development feature indicate abnormal alpha-synuclein deposit destroy key area brain involve control movement cognition . Patients synucleinopathies sign CNS-deficits frequently diagnose Parkinson disease ( PD ) , dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) . However , accumulation alpha-synuclein death nerve cell also begin outside brain autonomic nerve . In case , syncucleinopathies present first symptoms autonomic impairment ( unexplained constipation , urinary difficulty , sexual dysfunction ) . In rare case , hypotension standing ( disorder know orthostatic hypotension ) may clinical finding . This `` pre-motor '' autonomic stage suggest disease process may yet spread brain . After variable period time , usually within 5-years , patient abnormally low blood pressure stand develop cognitive motor abnormality . This stepwise evolution indicate disease spread body brain . Another indication spread act dream ( i.e. , REM sleep behavior disorder , RBD ) problem occur low part brain affect , may also first noticeable sign Parkinson disease . The purpose study document clinical feature biological marker patient synucleinopathies well understand disorder evolve time . The study involve follow patient diagnose synucleinopathy ( PD/DLB MSA ) believe `` pre-motor '' stage ( isolated autonomic impairment and/or RBD ) . Through careful series follow-up visit participate Centers , focus find biological clue predict patient develop motor/cognitive problem one resilience keep disease bay prevent spread brain . We also define natural history MSA - aggressive synucleinopathies .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>α-synuclein small protein 140 amino acid highly express brain . It 's function remain poorly understood.10 Synucleinopathies group neurodegenerative disease associate abnormal accumulation α-synuclein within cytoplasmic inclusion neuron oligodendroglia . These α-synuclein containing cytoplasmic aggregate occur throughout brain , produce cell death specific motor , autonomic cognitive dysfunction four phenotypically distinct synucleinopathies . When α-synuclein deposition occur neuron aggregate Lewy body , produce Parkinson disease ( PD ) , dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) pure autonomic failure ( PAF ) . Whereas multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) neuronal death probably occur consequence α-synuclein aggregation oligodendroglia . A characteristic feature synucleinopathies begin vary degree autonomic dysfunction sole clinical feature - imply initial diagnosis isolate ( pure ) autonomic failure 11 . After variable period time , usually less 5 year , small number patient remain pure autonomic failure phenotype , careful follow-up lack 11 . Most patient develop cognitive motor abnormality ( ) patient diagnose PD , DLB MSA . This stepwise clinical progression suggest neurodegenerative process rare case remain confined autonomic neurons12 , frequently spread affect additional area central nervous system ( CNS ) . This unique feature synucleinopathies pose diagnostic challenge potential therapeutic opportunity . The challenge first , determine whether PAF distinct disease always prodromal phase PD , DLB MSA second , discover biomarkers predict spread motor cognitive neuron . Such biomarkers would allow test disease-modifying strategy delay stop neurodegenerative process pre-motor pre-dementia phase . Aim 2 focus define natural history MSA , aggressive synucleinopathies . This prospective observational study establish disease-specific milestone use future clinical trial . Obstacles identify biomarkers predict CNS involvement medical center see patient synucleinopathies already develop motor cognitive involvement , PAF MSA rare disorder . In context Autonomic Disorders Consortium ( ADC ) within Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network ( RDCRN ) National Institutes Health ( NIH ) create objective providing well understanding variability , progression , natural history neurodegenerative synucleinopathies . Continuing observational study , increase power include additional academic center U.S. , South America , Europe , allow u define natural history disease establish sensitivity specificity propose biomarkers .</detailed_description>
