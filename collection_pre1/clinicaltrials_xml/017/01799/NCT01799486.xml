	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection serious clinical problem worldwide distribution potential adverse outcome , include cirrhosis , major cause HBV relate death . Studies show use nucleot ( ) ide analogs treatment alleviate , even reverse progress HBV-related cirrhosis . In cirrhosis stage , potential factor , include endocrine disorder , renin , aldosterone , vasopressin increase , hepatitis B virus related nephritis , hepatorenal syndrome , may cause renal damage . With exposure NAs , adverse report rhabdomyolysis , renal dysfunction , lactic acidosis increase . So choose NAs , potential renal function impairment consider . Recently , Gane , Xiaoxi Li separately report Telbivudine improve estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) patient chronic hepatitis B , eGFR patient Lamivudine , adefovir entecavir trend decrease , suggest Telbivudine may renal protective effect . This effect patient HBV-related liver cirrhosis study , clear . This study randomize control study prospectively observe Telbivudine 's effect renal function , aim provide evidence antiviral treatment patient cirrhosis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible enrolment study must meet following criterion : eGFR baseline le 90 ml.min1.1.73m2 Aged 1875 year ( inclusive ) . Male female . Subjects positive HBsAg 6 month antiHBs negative regardless HBeAg status . If eAg+ , HBV DNA ≥2×104 IU/ml &lt; 2×108 IU/ml ; If eAg , HBV DNA ≥2×103 IU/ml &lt; 2×106 IU/ml . Subjects HBVrelated liver cirrhosis , include compensate cirrhosis decompensated , ChildPugh A B. Cirrhosis diagnose evidence small , nodular liver , show ultrasound , computerize omography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance ( MR ) , exclusion primary biliary cirrhosis cirrhosis cause schistosome . The ablility understand sign write informed consent prior study related procedure comply requirement study . Subjects meet follow criterion must enrol study History hypersensitivity study drug drug similar chemical structure Patient pregnant breastfeeding . Subjects nonHBV cirrhosis Coinfection HAV/HCV/HDV/ HIV Patients previously involve trial telbivudine . Patient receive nucleoside nucleotide drug whether approve investigational time . Patient receive IFN immunomodulatory treatment 6 month Screening study . Patient history malignancy organ system , treat untreated , within past 5 year whether evidence local recurrence metastasis , exception localize basal cell carcinoma skin . Patients previous finding suggestive possible hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , disease rule prior entrance study . Patient one additional know primary secondary cause liver disease CHB , include steatohepatitis，autoimmune hepatitis . Gilbert 's syndrome DubinJohnson syndrome consider exclusion criterion study . History acute chronic medical condition opinion investigator would make patient unsuitable inclusion study . Patient currently abuse alcohol illicit drug , history alcohol abuse illicit substance abuse within precede two year . Patient medical condition require frequent prolong use systemic corticosteroid , although inhaled corticosteroid allow . Patient history clinical laboratory evidence chronic renal insufficiency . Patient medical condition require chronic prolong use potentially hepatotoxic drug nephrotoxic drug . Patient concurrent medical social condition likely preclude compliance schedule evaluation protocol , likely confound efficacy safety observation study . Use investigational drug time enrollment , within 30 day 5 halflives enrollment , whichever longer . Patient history myopathy , myositis , persistent muscle weakness . Kidney impairment due nonHBV factor Inability comply study requirement determine study investigator Patients eGFR≤15 ml.min1.1.73m2 , may need dialysis renal transplantation</criteria>
