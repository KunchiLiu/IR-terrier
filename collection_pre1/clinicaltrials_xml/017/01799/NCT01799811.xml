	<brief_summary>The objective Study evaluate short- long-term clinical outcome patient receive CryoVein cryopreserved saphenous vein allograft ( CVA ) primary open bypass conduit ass quantifiable correlation time placement primary bypass graft improve long-term clinical outcome patient critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryopreserved Saphenous Vein Allograft Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia Peripheral Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A minimum 50 CVA implant enrol patient 6 participate site . The Study include prospective evaluation patient discharge , 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month follow surgery . The window follow-up visit Â± 2 week time point . All Study patient expect participate follow-up evaluation unless precluded patient death . Patient status graft performance data collect patient consent enrolled Study . The primary endpoint Study limb salvage . The secondary endpoint Study include primary patency , secondary patency , morbidity mortality per reporting standard . Patient attribute ( age , gender , etc . ) preoperative assessment ( indication surgery , medical history ) summarize use descriptive statistic . Graft performance present freedom event endpoint ( patient death , graft complication , amputation , graft explant ) calculate Kaplan-Meier method . Log Rank Cox Regression utilize comparison subgroup patient population . Statistical software use compile analyze submit clinical data . The method data reporting may include , limited , description sample population , frequency distribution patient demographic , allograft statistic , follow-up percentage , summary event data , correlation analysis , actuarial analysis</detailed_description>
