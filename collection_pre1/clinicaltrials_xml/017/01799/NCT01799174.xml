	<brief_summary>This randomize , blind , control trial ass efficacy safety UVA1 phototherapy treatment active morphea adult child . Forty patient randomize receive either medium dose ( 70 J/cm2 ) phototherapy ( active UVA1 phototherapy ) ultraviolet translucent acrylic screen `` sham '' UVA1 ( 0 J/cm2 ) phototherapy ultraviolet opaque acrylic screen 3 time per week 10 week . The phototherapists , patient , principal investigator blind whether patient receive active sham UVA1 phototherapy . Patients allow apply emollient study . Patients complete randomized placebo control trial ( RPCT ) follow open observation period 3 month . During open phase , outcome measure RPCT ( LoSSI , PGA-A ) assess every 5 week well adverse event . Patients receive sham UVA1 phototherapy invite receive active UVA1 phototherapy use protocol RPCT open observation . Adult patient enrol RPCT also part nest translational study investigate effect UVA1 phototherapy gene expression whole skin biopsy take ( Study Visit 1 ) UVA1 phototherapy ( Study Visit 3 ) . Gene expression profile compare lesional skin treatment well nonlesional skin .</brief_summary>
