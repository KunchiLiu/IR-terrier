	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN - Screening − Assessment subject 's eligibility participate determine inclusion/exclusion criterion . - Biopsy schedule - Subjects biopsied accord schedule Section 7 . - Induction - The recommended induction dose ipilimumab 3 mg/kg administer intravenously 90-minute period every 3 week total four dos , tolerate . - Laboratory evaluation perform result examined administration ipilimumab dose . - As durable disease stabilization and/or objective tumor response see early progression Week 12 , recommend , absence dose-limiting toxicity ( eg , serious immune-mediated adverse reaction ) , four dos ipilimumab administer initial 12 week even set apparent clinical progression , provide subject 's performance status remain stable . - All subject enter induction period , include may discontinue treatment drug-related AEs and/or evidence clinical progression induction period , obtain 12-week tumor assessment . - Based clinical experience ongoing complete melanoma study , follow recommendation apply subject management light Week 12 later tumor assessment : - The appearance new lesion subject stable shrink baseline tumor burden may experience clinical benefit continue follow-up and/or maintenance therapy alternative anti-cancer agent consider . These subject see continued tumor shrinkage follow-up scan . - As long overall tumor burden stable decreasing , subject remain follow-up and/or maintenance ( see ) , even presence new lesion . - Clinical progression warrant alternative anti-cancer treatment consider subject whose overall tumor burden appear substantially increase and/or subject whose performance status decrease . - Patients eligible retreatment treatment ipilimumab protocol - Follow-up − Subjects require attend follow-up visit within 90 day last ipilimumab treatment . - Re-treatment Patients receive ipilimumab dose prior/parent study meet follow criterion : - Had unacceptable toxicity require ipilimumab discontinuation ; OR - Patients permanently discontinue treatment due select irAEs follow : 1 . Reversible autoimmune hepatitis 2 . Medically manageable endocrinopathy 3 . Reversible dermatological toxicity AND - Have experience documented disease progression demonstrate expand clinical benefit . Expanded clinical benefit define : - Patients whose disease respond ( partial response , complete response ) ; - Patients whose disease stable equal 3 month . - Patients demonstrate mixed delay response . The mixed delay response define follow : Patients Mixed Response : define least 50 % reduction bidimensional size one non-cystic lesion , even presence new lesion . Patients Delayed Response : define objective response ( PR CR ) follow progressive disease , occur time Week 12 prior/parent protocol , patient receive therapy non ipilimumab anti-cancer agent ( approved experimental ) PD objective response . Patients select irAEs related ipilimumab completely resolve immunosuppressive therapy adequately control hormone therapy , may consider re-treatment ipilimumab study , time disease progression . The list completely reversible medically manage immune-related adverse event ( irAEs ) eligible consideration : - Reversible autoimmune hepatitis - Medically manage endocrinopathy - Reversible dermatological toxicity All irAEs consider eligible re-treatment , include , limited , great equal Grade 3 colitis diarrhea , uveitis grade .</detailed_description>
