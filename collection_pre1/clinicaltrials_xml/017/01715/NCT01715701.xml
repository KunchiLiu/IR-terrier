	<brief_summary>This study design ass : - The impact preoperative multilevel thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade compare intercostal nerve blockade perform end surgery intensity postoperative pain subject Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) device primary analgesic modality . - The incidence chronic pain 6 month follow video-assisted thoracic surgery . - The impact preoperative multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade patient ' quality life 6 month follow surgery compare intercostal nerve blockade control group use PCA alone . Hypothesis : 1 . The basic hypothesis study preoperative thoracic multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade multilevel intercostal nerve blockade perform end surgery provide superior postoperative analgesia lower opioid consumption compare PCA alone first 24 hour follow surgery . 2 . Preoperative thoracic multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade reduce incidence chronic pain 6 month follow surgery . 3 . Preoperative thoracic multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade multilevel intercostal nerve blockade perform end surgery shorten length stay intermediate intensive care unit shorten hospital stay . 4 . Preoperative thoracic multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade multilevel intercostal nerve blockade perform end surgery reduce postoperative pulmonary complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Paravertebral Nerve Blockade Reduce Pain Following Thoracoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Video-assisted thoracoscopy increase popularity . Although consider less invasive treatment thoracotomy , patient report moderate severe pain variable duration . Benefits adequate analgesia longer need demonstrate . Optimal analgesia lead faster recovery , reduces risk postoperative complication , enhance patient 's satisfaction quality life follow surgery . Furthermore , adequate postoperative analgesia may reduce occurrence chronic pain . The incidence chronic pain follow thoracoscopic procedure range 20-47 % . The ideal postoperative analgesia regimen pain related thoracoscopy elucidate . Systemic opioids give patient-controlled device ( PCA ) may use thoracoscopic procedure analgesic effect limit undesirable side-effects may occur . Thoracic epidural emerge preferred pain control technique follow thoracotomy . However , role epidural analgesia thoracoscopy remain debatable . Side-effects may outweigh benefit technique context minimally invasive surgery . Paravertebral blockade alternative epidural analgesia . The duration pain relief associate technique may vary 4 48 hour . Its effectiveness show equal superior epidural analgesia post-thoracotomy pain . Its popularity pain management follow thoracotomy promote use thoracoscopic procedure . Preoperative paravertebral blockade could also result reduction chronic pain follow surgery . Intercostal nerve blockade widely use alleviate pain follow thoracoscopy . This technique know provide adequate short-term pain relief . Both paravertebral intercostal block could interest adjunct patient-controlled device pain management follow thoracoscopic procedure . This study compare efficacy preoperative paravertebral nerve blockade intercostal nerve blockade perform skin closure PCA alone reduce intensity pain follow thoracoscopic procedure . All patient PCA device primary analgesic modality .</detailed_description>
