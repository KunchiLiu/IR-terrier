	<brief_title>Biomarkers Before After Nephrectomy Locally Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Treated With Everolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label , exploratory , single-arm , multicenter trial . Treatment everolimus initiate patient undergone baseline screening provide write informed consent . Everolimus administer orally , daily , 6 week follow 1-week rest period prior surgery . The start dose 10 mg daily provision dose reduction base tolerability . Radical nephrectomy perform end week 7 . For metastatic patient , two four week surgery , everolimus reintroduce . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal patient consent , stop rule meet . Patients locally advance renal carcinoma stop drug intake nephrectomy . Resumption everolimus may postpone case delay wound heal surgical complication . After treatment discontinuation last treatment visit ( 28-days last dose ) , patient follow order collect data onset progression survival . In metastatic patient discontinue treatment reason disease progression , tumor assessment continue every 3 month , disease progression initiation anticancer therapy one year follow-up .</detailed_description>
