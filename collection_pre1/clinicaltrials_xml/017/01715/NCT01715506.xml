Effects measure resident care staff level baseline randomization , intervention ( 7 month ) follow-up ( 7 month later ) intervention group . An analysis many unit need include base 12+12 cluster . Two calculation perform . The first calculation base big reduction use restraint . We assume model 60 % reduction use restraint intervention group 33 % reduction control group ( Hawthorne effect ) . For reason need include averagely 13 patient department/unit order achieve statistical power 0,8 . Measures resident collect skilled research nurse blind study . Care staff measure collect questionnaire distribute directly care staff , provide stamp envelope return questionnaire directly research group . In addition , department characteristic ( like type department , staff coverage , architecture ) register . A research team lead EI , four facilitator team consist one nurse one assistant professor nursing school responsible EI decision-making model NHs .
