	<brief_summary>The investigator previously show antibody class switching ( IgM IgG , IgA IgE ) antibody secretion control polymorphic `` 3 ' regulatory region '' ( 3'RR ) immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) locus . Alleles 3'RR show influence severity progression IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) ( over-representation B allele among patient severe kidney IgA deposit ) . Allele B also constitute risk factor celiac disease , herpetiform dermatitis , psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis . Since 3'RR appear crucial regulator Ig production , wish check whether genetic polymorphism might influence occurrence immunopathologic process involve class-switched antibody deregulate production also severity disease time course progression . We wish focus two condition involve class-switched antibody : one hand severe form IgE hypersensitivity , hand disease involve pathogenic IgA prognosis currently difficult predict onset disease : Henoch-Schonlein purpura ( HSP ) . Regarding hypersensitivity , diversity clinical manifestation prompt u focus homogeneous group patient thus wish concentrate two group patient frequently refer hospital : severe allergy Hymenoptera venom severe food allergy relate peanut allergens sensitization . These group build consider multiple clinical criterion ( clinical history , severity manifestation , positive skin test , positive oral provocation test peanut allergens… ) biological criterion authenticate mechanisms disease ( high specific serum IgE , demonstration specific basophil activation allergen… ) . In parallel study patient , include large cohort healthy control ( 400 individual ) , order able decipher whether correlation see : - IgH 3'RR genotype - The serum accumulation various Ig class , include IgG subclass , IgA ( sometimes depict protective , sometimes tolerogenic anti-inflammatory ) IgE ( highly pro-inflammatory responsible hypersensitivity ) - IgG allotypes ( 6 frequent IgG haplotypes know human previously report correlated varying level IgG IgE production normal individual ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study thus finally provide answer 5 question currently un-addressed : - How 3'RR allele link IgG allotypes correspond IgH haplotype ? - Is physiological link 3'RR allele production various Ig class sub-classes ? - Is 3'RR polymorphism connect risk severe form allergic disease ? - Is 3'RR polymorphism connect risk occurrence and/or severe evolution HSP ? - Is oncogenicity translocation affect IgH locus connect strength 3'RR allelic variant ?</detailed_description>
