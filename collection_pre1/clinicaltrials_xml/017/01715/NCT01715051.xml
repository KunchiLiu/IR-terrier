	<brief_title>D-Serine Cocaine Dependence Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN . This 12 week , 2 group randomize control trial complete outpatient setting . Eligible participant randomize D-serine match placebo schedule attend three research visit per week throughout active treatment phase begin randomization end day 7 study week 12 . A single visit schedule week 13 complete retrospective data week 12 . Participants receive D-serine placebo throughout 12-week active treatment phase . Randomization 1:1 ratio , stratify cocaine use frequency ( &lt; 10 day ≥ 10 day 28 day prior consent ) . STUDY POPULATION . Approximately 80 participant recruit single site randomize . The study population include adult meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV-Text Revision ( DSM-IV-TR ) criterion cocaine dependence use cocaine 30 day prior consent provide least one benzoylecgonine ( BE ) positive urine screening/baseline . TREATMENTS . Study participant randomly assign receive either D-serine ( target ~60 mg/kg per day ) match placebo . All participant receive weekly manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy 12 week treatment period . Medication adherence assess Medication Events Monitoring System ( MEMS ) . EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS . The primary outcome measure cocaine abstinence three consecutive week , abstinence week define self-report cocaine use week well negative urine BE ( BE &lt; 300 ng/mL ) result week least two urine sample provide . Key secondary efficacy measure include proportion urine BE negative result obtain cocaine abstinence study week 11 12 measure self-report urine BE . Other efficacy measure include drug attention bias , cocaine craving , drug compulsivity , cocaine withdrawal symptom , treatment retention . SAFETY ASSESSMENTS . Safety measure include urinalysis , adverse event ( AEs ) , vitals , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , laboratory test . Tolerability assess proportion participant need dose reduction discontinue study medication . ANALYSIS . Each outcome variable analyze use appropriate statistical method intention-to-treat ( ITT ) population evaluable population . All participant take least one study medication dose include safety analysis . Data summarize treatment group . Summary statistic include mean , sample size , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum value continuous variable , frequency percentages categorical variable .</detailed_description>
