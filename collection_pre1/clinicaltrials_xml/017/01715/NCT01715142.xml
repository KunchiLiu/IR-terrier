	<brief_summary>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) highly lethal disease conventional treatment little impact disease course . Novel approach urgently need address inherent resistance current therapy identify new drug combination high chance success pancreatic cancer patient . This proof-of-concept trial study `` dynamic '' tumor response administration short course gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) ( ) window interval ( 4 weeks= 1 cycle ) surgery resectable pancreatic cancer ( cohort 1 = 21 patient ) ( b ) least 8 week ( 2 cycle ) locally advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer ( cohort 2 = 10 patient ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Tumor Perfusion Chemotherapy Combining Gemcitabine Nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer hypoperfused tumor , characterize high stroma density preclude cytotoxics delivery epithelial tumoral compartment . There thus rationale combine chemotherapy antistromal drug like nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) , solvent ( CremophorÂ® EL ) -free , albumin-bound form paclitaxel initially develop reduce toxicity associate Taxol injection maintain improve chemotherapeutic effect . This unique protein formulation provide novel approach increase intra-tumoral concentration drug receptor-mediated transport process allow transcytosis across endothelial cell . Abraxane approve commercialization 38 country , include US , Canada , EU , Australia , China , India Korea treatment woman metastatic breast cancer . Abraxane alone combination evaluate number cancer , include metastatic melanoma , non-small cell lung cancer , pancreatic cancer solid tumor .</detailed_description>
