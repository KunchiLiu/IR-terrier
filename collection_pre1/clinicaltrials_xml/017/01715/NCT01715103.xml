	<detailed_description>Eighty-five percent new case HIV infection involve South mode transmission predominantly heterosexual . In northern country , sexual transmission also majority . These epidemiological consideration clearly indicate HIV mainly transmit mucosally . Clinical observation show people `` resistant '' HIV , ie become infected despite repeat sexual exposure virus . The `` resistance '' HIV expose uninfected partner may due absence infection target cell mucosa host , elimination HIV infect cell effective infection . Biological factor govern individual resistance HIV remain poorly understood . An immune response direct cervicovaginal HIV antigen , include viral envelope glycoprotein describe small number HIV-negative woman sexually expose virus resistant infection . These observation demonstrate compartmentalization mucosal immune response woman , induce HIV antigen independently systemic humoral immunity . In addition , cytotoxic cervicovaginal immunity HIV show woman , suggest viral antigen present immune system HLA-I , therefore HIV antigens able cross mucosal barrier . A second hypothesis , exclude first , immune response induce repeat deposition viral antigens cervicovaginal mucosa . It show HEPS woman ( Highly sexually expose HIV-1 persistently IgG seronegative purpose ) existence IgA antibody direct gp41 inhibit transcytosis virus monolayer epithelial cell neutralize infection CD4 T cell vitro . Soluble factor also play important role mucosal transmission HIV . Indeed , lymphokine RANTES , MIP-1a MIP-1b , SDF-1 natural ligand HIV co-receptors find vary concentration vaginal secretion . More recently , show CCL20/MIP3alpha , produce epithelial cell genital HIV could interact X4-and R5-tropic inhibit infection . The common technique use study immunological microbiological factor female genital tract cervicovaginal lavage ( CVL ) swab cervix . As part comprehensive approach different aspect mucosal immunity , necessary use technique acquisition large number information use small amount sample . Thus , technique transcriptomic analysis microarrays , tell u change thousand gene , use technique multiplex quantification soluble factor ( cytokine soluble factor immunity innate mucosal ) must adapt , test validated start vaccine trial sample need immunological assessment exploit optimally . A first phase I trial ( ANRS VAC14 ) evaluate safety immunogenicity mucosal systemic recombinant gp160 protein oligomeric administer nasally vaginally without adjuvant ( DC-Chol ) , perform woman seronegative HIV . The goal induce secretory IgA ( SIgA ) level specific genital mucosa . In study , storage condition supernatants cervicovaginal secretion cell optimal study transcriptome . However , sample show feasibility transcriptomic analysis use Illumina technology . We able sample determine profile mRNA expression cytokine profile . These preliminary result lead u propose new study , preserve RNA , cell pellet treat buffer RLT+ Qiagen freeze -80 Â°C . In addition , protease inhibitor add directly wash liquid preserve cervicovaginal immunoglobulin cytokine degradation . We propose feasibility study immunological transcriptomic analysis cervicovaginal sample woman infect infected HIV-1 . Secondarily assess tolerance sample take cytobrush cervicovaginal washing , efficiency reproducibility sample cytobrush cervicovaginal lavage transcriptomic analysis , measurement cytokine Luminex technology , quantification IgG IgA . In blood determine phenotype B cell Tfh cell frequency ( T follicular helper ) quantification serum immunoglobulins perform transcriptomic analysis blood cell . Finally make correlation observed response genital mucosa . This pathophysiological exploratory study perform 20 woman infect HIV-1 20 healthy woman recruit two center France include screen visit two visit M0 M1 mucous blood sample perform . The result study capitalize skill biology mucosa , use powerful tool assess mucosal immunological parameter . These standardized tool use evaluation mucosal immune response induce prototype vaccine , cohort study search correlate protection . These tool also use evaluation local tolerance application molecule microbicides .</detailed_description>
