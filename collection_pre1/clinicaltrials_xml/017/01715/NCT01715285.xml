	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine newly diagnose ( within previous 3 month ) participant metastatic ( spread cancer cell one part body another ) hormone-naive prostate cancer ( mHNPC ) high-risk prognostic factor benefit addition abiraterone acetate low-dose prednisone androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ; lutenizing hormone release hormone [ LHRH ] agonists surgical castration ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Abiraterone Acetate Plus Low-Dose Prednisone Plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) Versus ADT Alone Newly Diagnosed Participants With High-Risk , Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer ( mHNPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( treatment group assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo ( inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) -controlled study design determine efficacy abiraterone acetate low-dose prednisone participant mHNPC . The study consist 4 part : Screening Phase ( , 28 day study commences Day 1 ) ; Double-blind treatment Phase ( consist 4-week dose cycle wherein abiraterone acetate administer 1,000 milligram [ mg ] along 5 mg prednisone placebo orally ) ; Follow-up Phase ( every 4 month 60 month death , lose follow , withdrawal consent study termination ) Open-label Extension ( OLE ) Phase . Participants Double-blind Treatment Phase opportunity enroll OLE Phase . The OLE Phase allow participant receive active drug ( abiraterone acetate plus prednisone ) Long-term Extension ( LTE ) Phase additional period 3 year . Participants discontinue study treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity unless , Investigator 's opinion , deem participant continue derive benefit study treatment . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio active treatment group ( abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily plus prednisone 5 mg daily plus ADT ) control group ( ADT plus placebo ) .Efficacy evaluate primarily overall survival radiographic progression-free survival . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
