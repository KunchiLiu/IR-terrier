	<brief_summary>Rationale : Plant stanols well know effect lower intestinal cholesterol absorption ultimately result 10-15 % reduce serum LDL cholesterol concentration human . In addition also show serum triacylglycerol ( TG ) concentration may lower subject elevate baseline concentration . Till , little evidence plant stanol effect improve lipid profile . However , recently find strong indication ex vivo model use isolated human peripheral mononuclear blood cell ( PBMCs ) healthy volunteer plant stanols capacity improve immune function . More detail , plant stanols shift differentiation naive T-cells Th1 direction activate specific receptor present Antigen presenting cell ( APCs ) T-cells . This effect might ultimately helpful situation Th1/Th2 cell balance disturb Th2 over-responsiveness . By activate Th1 response , disturbed balance may restore . This example possibility treatment prevention asthma , food allergy HIV susceptible subject . In addition , recently ( MEC 08-3-051 ) pilot study also show ex vivo Th1 stimulate effect plant stanols specifically PBMCs isolate asthma patient , say , condition characterize Th2 dominant immune response . Objective : The major research objective prove consumption plant stanol ester enrich yogurt improve immune function vivo asthma patient . Study design : A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled human intervention study 90 patient clinically proven asthma participate : 45 intervention group receive plant stanol yoghurt 45 control group receive control yoghurt without added plant stanols . At end run-in period well end experimental period blood sample isolate PBMCs . These cell use evaluate effect cytokine production , phagocytic capacity neutrophil , activity NK cell . In addition , golden standard show improvement immune function show elevated Immunoglobulin response vaccine . Therefore , experimental period subject receive vaccination Hepatitis A Virus . After 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 week blood sample monitor specific immunoglobulin titer HAV . Study population : 90 people clinically proven asthma , carrier hepatitis A , B C vaccinate hepatitis A past . Also , participant immune-related pathology Main study parameters/endpoints : primary : Specific anti-HAV antibody titer vaccination ; secondary : Phagocytic capacity neutrophil ; NK-cell activity ; Th1 Th2 cytokine production profile PHA stimulate PMBCs . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : During study , 9 blood sample ( 20 50 mL ) take . Total time investment subject 160 min . Occasionally , heamatoma bruise occur venipuncture . After vaccination heamatoma sore arm occur . These side effect disappear within 4-5 day . Other common side effect relate vaccination headache , loss appetite , fatigue , usually disappear within 24 hour . The result study show whether consumption plant stanol enrich yogurt able restore disturbed th1/Th2 balance asthma patient . Ultimately , expect reduce asthmatic exacerbation , Th2 dominant immune response seem causal asthmatic symptom , however clinical improvement verify relatively short term intervention study .</brief_summary>
