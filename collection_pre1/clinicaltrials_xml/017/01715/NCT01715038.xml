	<detailed_description>This study cluster-randomized control trial four study `` arm '' , implement within context Community Health Development Program ( CHDP ) run World Mission Prayer League , also hospital area know LAMB . Data collection longitudinal , start identification woman early pregnancy eligible enter study , continue , follow-up child , 24 month post-partum . A final follow-up visit occur child 36 month old update contact information ; outcome data collect final visit . The investigator evaluate effect provide LNS-PLW mother pregnancy lactation maternal health nutrition outcome ( include anthropometric micronutrient status ) , morbidity birth outcome comparison mother receive iron-folic acid tablet pregnancy lactation . The investigator also evaluate effect three different home-fortification approach ( arm a-c , ) child health nutrition outcomes include anthropometric status , micronutrient status , anemia , motor cognitive development , comparison control arm receiving home fortification intervention . Additionally , cost implementation delivery LNS-PLW , LNS-child MNP intervention part CHDP compare standard CHDP program delivery document . Willingness pay ( private demand ) LNS-PLW , LNS-child MNP product select caregiver male head household assess baseline various point intervention period . A process evaluation LNS MNP intervention , service provide control group , within CHDP conduct : 1 ) Document evaluate process need implementation intervention provide nutrient supplement LNS MNP context CHDP ; 2 ) Explain interpret program effectiveness study result identify important facilitator barrier success nutrition intervention , use improve effectiveness current CHDP program future similar program include scaling-up LNS MNP . A post-intervention follow-up assessment participant RDNS trial add study protocol November 2015 . The intervention stop study child turn 24 month old , follow-up visit update contact information conduct child turn 36 month old . Thereafter , study child 40 52 month old , follow-up assessment include anthropometric cognitive development assessment collection blood sample ( finger prick , measurement hemoglobin ) buccal swab sample local clinic ; mother follow-up include anthropometric measurement , measurement blood pressure collection fast blood sample ( finger prick ) . The follow-up also include anthropometric measurement young sibling , well home visit collect information socioeconomic status , food security , hospitalization mother child , developmental stimulation home , child food preference retrospective perception trial intervention . Follow-up outcome : Maternal : Body mass index , skinfold thickness , mid-upper arm circumference , attain height . Hemoglobin , anemia , blood pressure , blood lipid , HbA1C . Index child : Height , HAZ , stunt , weight , WHZ , WAZ , wasting , skinfold thickness , MUAC , arm fat muscle area .
