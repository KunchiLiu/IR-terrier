	<brief_summary>People single-sided deafness ( SSD ) significant hearing loss one ear normal near normal hearing ear . Those live SSD experience several communication difficulty , particularly listen speech presence background noise . This problem bad situation noise side good ear speech side poor ear . The Bone-anchored hearing device ( BAHD ) Contralateral Routing Signals ( CROS ) hear aid two intervention method design improve hear people significant hearing loss one ear . The BAHD surgically implant device also include external processor ; sound poor ear transmit good ear skull vibration . The CROS involve surgery ; instead hear aid fit behind ear , sound side poor ear wirelessly transmit good ear . The majority previous study compare BAHD CROS use old CROS model basic technology wire along neck send sound poor ear good ear . There lack study compare new digital wireless CROS hearing aid BAHD . The current research compare effect BAHD CROS hear aid speech perception score listen speech quiet noise . The research also investigate participant ' report benefit device everyday situation . In order compare BAHD CROS , individual already implant BAHD give trial period new wireless digital CROS hearing aid . The research hypothesis state CROS hear aid equally beneficial great BAHD improve hear participant benefit . If finding support hypothesis CROS offer much benefit BAHD , even well alternative , individual SSD may choose avoid surgery decide receive CROS hearing aid instead .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Wireless CROS Bone-anchored Hearing Devices Single-Sided Deafness : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Users BAHD give 2-week trial period Unitron Tandem CROS hearing aid . Participants randomly assign wear either BAHD two week trial CROS two week . There total three visit make clinic . During visit : - Participants ' hearing test ( either BAHD , CROS , without wear device ) . - Speech perception ability test quiet noise condition ( either wear BAHD , CROS , device ) . - Participants ask complete two standardized questionnaire perceive benefit BAHD CROS provide . In addition , participant ask fill short diary form every day , two-week period , report situation wore device .</detailed_description>
