	<brief_summary>Patients coronary artery disease require coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) risk postoperative complication surgery . The StaRT-CABG trial first large-scale ( 2,630 patient ) investigate whether additional treatment statin ( lipid-lowering medication ) high dos CABG surgery reduce incidence major post-surgery complication include death , myocardial infarction stroke . The StaRT-CABG trial recruiting patient 8 cardiac surgery centre Germany expect provide relevant clinical data efficacy novel treatment order optimize care patient undergo CABG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients coronary artery disease ( CAD ) require coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) still significant risk postoperative major adverse cardiocerebral event ( ≈15 % MACCE rate ) , ≈3 % patient die within 30 day surgery . Recent clinical evidence show cardioprotection patient receive chronic statin treatment improve high-dose statin 'recapture ' therapy give shortly ischemia-reperfusion sequence , result 61 % risk reduction MACE 30 day patient undergoing PCI . Evaluation novel approach set CABG seem particularly promising , myocardial injury , surgery-related inflammation pre-existing patient ' comorbidities play pivotal role poor clinical outcome CABG may improve acute statin recapture therapy . The StaRT-CABG trial first large-scale ( n=2,630 CABG patient ) , multicentre ( 8 cardiac surgery centre ) , randomise , double-blind placebo-controlled trial aim test whether acute high-dose statin recapture therapy give shortly CABG reduces incidence MACCE 30 day surgery ( composite primary outcome : all-cause mortality ; non-fatal myocardial infarction cerebrovascular event ) . The StaRT-CABG trial expect provide highly relevant clinical data efficacy novel therapeutic approach order optimize care CAD patient undergo CABG broad clinical implication current clinical practice exist guideline .</detailed_description>
