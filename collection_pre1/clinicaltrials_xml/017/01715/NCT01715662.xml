	<brief_summary>This pilot randomize control trial ass feasibility home-based Nintendo Wii Fit program ( Wii.n.Walk ) improve walk capacity old adult low limb amputation . Twenty four individual unilateral below-knee above-knee amputation randomly allocate Wii.n.Walk control arm . The Wii.n.Walk arm receive aerobics , weight-shifting , balance game exercise use Wii Fit game technology . The control arm receive cognitive computer game exercise use Wii Big Brain Academy Degree program . Both group receive intervention 40-minute session , 3x/week 4 week . The intervention conduct combination in-clinic group ( n=3 ) train individualize in-home training . Outcome measurement complete blind evaluator baseline , end treatment , 3 week end treatment . Hypothesis : Our primary hypothesis Wii.n.Walk feasible . Our primary clinical hypothesis participant Wii.n.Walk intervention group experience improvement walk capacity compare control group . The secondary clinical hypothesis participant Wii.n.Walk group experience improvement balance confidence , physical activity , number step take per day , walk talk , low limb functioning , locomotor capability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot RCT Investigate Use Home-based Nintendo Wii Program Rehabilitation Older Adults With Lower Limb Amputation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To assess feasibility home-based Nintendo Wii Fit program ( Wii.n.Walk ) improve walk capacity old adult unilateral transtibial transfemoral amputation . This study provide seed data information ( e.g . sample size calculation ) leverage fund future RCT . Hypothesis : Our primary hypothesis Wii.n.Walk feasible . Our primary clinical hypothesis participant Wii.n.Walk intervention group experience improvement walk capacity compare control group . The secondary clinical hypothesis participant Wii.n.Walk group experience improvement balance confidence , physical activity , number step take per day , walk talk , low limb functioning , locomotor capability . Justification : Many old Canadians live low limb amputation ( LLA ) . The prevalence LLA project double 2050 primarily due chronic systemic dysvascular disease common age . Prosthetic rehabilitation program design enhance mobility primarily gait retrain . An ideal rehabilitation program optimize balance lower limb strength turn enhance walk capacity important determinant health relate quality life adult LLA . Providing rehabilitation program motivating engage challenge improvement require highly repetitious task performance . In 1994-97 , cost surgery , rehabilitation one year follow post LLAs vary $ 86,000 $ 110,000 ( US ) depend level amputation . Shrinking health care resource often make difficult deliver sufficient amount therapy achieve standard care , impossible deliver therapy . Thus , novel method practical , cost-effective , well-received client need deliver sufficient amount therapy . Commercially available gaming software Wii Fit Nintendo potential valuable intervention old adult LLA . Based pilot single subject research design study conduct developed Wii.n.Walk , home orient intervention target improve walk capacity individual LLA . Objectives : The objective study assess feasibility Wii.n.Walk : recruitment rate , consent rate , retention , perceive benefit intervention , adherence , blinding , adverse event , safety , treatment effect . Research Method : This parallel , single-blind RCT . Twenty four individual unilateral transtibial transfemoral randomly assign either Wii.n.Walk , Wii Big Brain ( 12 arm ) use computer-generated block randomization . The randomization do statistician involve part study . Subjects ( n=12 ) Wii.n.Walk arm train use Wii Fit game 40-minute session , 3 time week period 4 week . Subjects stand Wii Fit balance board interact Wii game weight shift use Wii remote controller . The intervention protocol include : 1 ) Yoga ( static single double leg exercise ) , 2 ) Balance game ( lateral poster/anterior weight shift exercise stand ) , 3 ) Aerobics ( run spot step class ) , 4 ) Strength training ( dynamic single double leg exercise ) . For in-clinic training session , train research assistant administer intervention provide external cue correction pose participant use unsafe technique . Subjects ( n=12 ) control arm train use Wii Big Brain program frequency duration Wii.n.Walk arm . A separate research assistant administer intervention provide supervision . Wii Big Brain low-cost commercially available game software improve cognitive function . The intervention conduct combination in-clinic group training ( n=3 ) in-home individualized training .</detailed_description>
