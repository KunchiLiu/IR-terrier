	<criteria>Patients must metastatic disease esophagus , gastroesophageal junction stomach . Patients locally recurrent disease deem eligible radiation also permit . Histological , cytologic radiographic documentation metastatic adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma esophagus , gastroesophageal junction stomach . Radiologic , endoscopic , histologic cytologic evidence locally recurrent disease also permit . Patients must untreated chemotherapy metastatic locally recurrent disease . Prior radiation therapy permit . Patients must measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Age &gt; 18 year â‰¤ 80 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function . Patients must follow condition : Recent major surgery , hormonal therapy ( replacement ) chemotherapy , within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event treatment . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition chemotherapy trial . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition chemotherapy use study . Concomitant use phenytoin , carbamazepine , barbiturate , rifampicin , phenobarbital , St John 's Wort ; drug induce CYP3A may decrease level taxanes . 5FU strong CYP2C9 inducer , concomitant use carvedilol , celocoxib , fosphenytoin , fluoxetine , phenytoin , warfarin CYP2C9 substrates use caution . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , unstable cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study chemotherapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction chemotherapeutic agent . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
