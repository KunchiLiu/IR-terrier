	<brief_summary>This study design compare efficacy endotracheal tube cuff pre-filled alkalinized lidocaine : - incidence cough emergence general anesthesia - time need emergence follow desflurane-based anesthesia - incidence sore throat extubation . The investigator 's hypothesis use endotracheal tube cuff pre-filled alkalinized lidocaine reduce incidence cough 50 % relative control group follow desflurane-based anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Alkalinized Lidocaine Endotracheal Tube Cuff Incidence Coughing During Emergence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence important period general anesthesia several problem occur . Coughing , hypertension , tachycardia agitation observe emergence general anesthesia . Desflurane newer volatile agent allow early recovery anesthesia . This agent lead early discharge rapid resumption normal activity surgery . However , incidence cough around 70 % report desflurane-based anesthesia . Different technique drug study reduce cough emergence . Among others , role lidocaine give intravenously , topically , intracuff study . Intracuff lidocaine show increase tolerance endotracheal tube without reduce swallow reflex . However , lidocaine slowly diffuses across tube 's cuff . The addition bicarbonates required increase diffusion underlie tracheal tissue . Alkalinization lidocaine allow diffusion 65 % neutral base form period 6 hour . In vitro study demonstrate optimal time local anesthetic diffusion cuff may vary 90 180 minute . Due low onset , technique would appropriate long-duration surgery . Pre-filling endotracheal tube cuff alkalinize lidocaine least 90 minute intubation could appropriate surgery expect last less two hour . This study assess efficacy pre-filling endotracheal tube cuff alkalinize lidocaine prevent cough emergence short-duration surgery .</detailed_description>
