	<brief_title>Sodium Nitrite Lung Transplant Patients Minimize Risk Pulmonary Graft Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While increase number patient advance lung disease candidate lung transplantation , short- long-term outcome severely compromise graft dysfunction , primarily form organ rejection . The early manifestation lung allograft dysfunction , term primary graft dysfunction ( PGD ) , represent form ischemia-reperfusion acute lung injury , occur severe form ( Grade 3 ) 10 35 % lung transplant recipients 1-6 . PGD primary cause early morbidity mortality transplantation strongly associate late development chronic lung rejection Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS . Early graft dysfunction contribute significantly suboptimal outcome lung transplantation failure lung transplant recipient achieve five-year survival rate comparable patient receive solid organ heart liver . The risk PGD limit time lung store ex-vivo , therefore restrict pool available donor . A critical advance prevention early late lung allograft dysfunction occur PGD successfully prevent minimize . In study , investigator propose test hypothesis administration Sodium Nitrite donor lung lung transplant recipient time transplantation safe reduce incidence grade 2 3 PGD , thereby improve clinical outcome minimal toxicity . Sodium Nitrite obtain commercial preparation ( Hope Pharmaceuticals , Sodium Nitrite Injection USP ( 30mg/mL ) NDC Number 60267-079-02 ) UPMC Pharmacy prepare formulation , infuse three time point . First infused preservation solution bag time organ procurement donor , allograft time transplantation , finally direct infusion organ recipient . The investigator plan enroll total 8 subject undergoing lung transplantation Phase IIA observational non-randomized pilot investigation evaluate safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetics Sodium Nitrite administration administer procured lung lung transplant recipient , prevention Primary Graft Dysfunction ( PGD ) . It anticipate positive result trial lead large clinical investigation Sodium Nitrite administration direct produce reduction PGD perhaps secondary obliterative bronchiolitis ; potentially allow extend organ storage , extend use marginal organ , effective use Donation Cardiac Death ( DCD ) organs undergo combination warm cold ischemia organ procurement .</detailed_description>
