	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug call Regadenoson ( Lexiscan ) learn whether drug work treat specific disease , case Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . It also mean FDA yet approve drug type disease . SCD inherit blood disorder cause red blood cell change shape round shape half-moon/crescent sickled shape . People SCD different type protein carry oxygen blood ( hemoglobin ) people without SCD . This different type hemoglobin make red blood cell change crescent shape certain condition . Sickle-shaped cell problem often get stuck blood vessel block flow blood , cause inflammation injury important area body . Regadenoson ( trade name Lexiscan ) drug may prevent inflammation injury cause sickle shape cell . This drug approve FDA use fast infusion heart stress test people unable exercise enough put stress heart make heart beat faster . Regadenoson study long infusion dose adult , safety issue identify ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01085201 ) . This first study look patient benefit long infusion drug . This drug use laboratory experiment information research study suggest drug may help protect body damage cause sickle-shaped cell research study . In research study , investigator specifically look see Regadenoson effective treatment pain crisis acute chest syndrome SCD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If willing participate research study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligibility . Many test procedure likely part regular sickle cell anemia care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . The test procedure include : medical history , physical examination , blood test , blood urine pregnancy test ( applicable ) electrocardiogram . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . At time screen also ask pain level . Because one know study option best , `` randomize '' one study group : `` study drug '' group , receive Regadenoson , `` control '' group , receive placebo . Randomization mean put group chance . It like flip coin . Neither research doctor choose group . You equal ( 50/50 ) chance place either group . Neither research doctor know group . You give study medication contain either Regadenoson placebo ( fluids medicine ) . You give one infusion study drug admit hospital pain crisis . The study drug infuse fluid . You stay hospital least 3 day 2 night . Your infusion 48 hour long , follow 6-hour observation period . During infusion , receive standard treatment pain crisis . The study drug give separate part body infusion part standard treatment . The study drug available participation study end . Before infusion : We place small tube vein call IV , use infuse study drug . It use infusion part standard treatment pain crisis . During study drug infusion , standard treatment give separate IV . We use standard treatment IV needle draw blood require blood test . If hard draw blood vein , may ask would like use peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC line ) blood draw . A PICC line small tube place vein arm go vein chest . A chest x-ray usually do make sure right vein . It choice decide whether would like use PICC line . We record blood pressure heart rate every 5-10 minute , stabilize . We also ask pain level time blood test . During 48 hour infusion : Your heart rate amount oxygen blood monitor continuously use device fit finger . We take 2-3 teaspoon blood 24 48 hour begin infusion test try understand drug affect body . We ask pain level time blood test . We take blood pressure every 30 minute first 2 hour , every hour next two hour , every 2 hour remainder infusion . A six hour observation period take place immediately infusion . At time undergo following : heart rate amount oxygen blood monitor continuously device fit finger . We take 5 teaspoon blood end period try understand study drug affect body . We ask pain level time blood test . We take blood pressure every 2 hour full duration observation period . You may eat drink anything contains caffeine , coffee , tea , chocolate soda infusion observation period . We would like keep track medical condition 30 day receive study drug . We would like contact telephone weekly 30 day participation see .</detailed_description>
