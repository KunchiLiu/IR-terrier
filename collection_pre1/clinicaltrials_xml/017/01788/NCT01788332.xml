	<brief_summary>In 2010 , 35,000 people die United Kingdom lung cancer , majority non-small cell cancer ( NSCLC ) . Chemotherapy one main treatment patient NSCLC treat still live average 9 10 month diagnosis . The purpose clinical trial find whether give drug call Olaparib follow chemotherapy benefit patient NSCLC respond initial chemotherapy treatment prolong time tumour regrows . Olaparib new , oral drug develop AstraZeneca may help slow cancer growth . The rationale clinical trial chemotherapy damage tumour cell DNA NSCLC tumours respond chemotherapy less able repair damage . This exploit use Olaparib block enzyme call Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) essential DNA repair . This prevent DNA repair cause cancer cell death mechanism know synthetic lethality . Synthetic lethality arise combination mutation two gene lead cell death . Up 300 patient receive standard chemotherapy treatment initially register trial . Of patient , 114 patient respond chemotherapy randomly allocate receive either Olaparib inactive dummy pill placebo mouth . The trial ass whether Olaparib delay disease progression follow standard chemotherapy treatment patient . It also show whether side effect add Olaparib follow standard treatment acceptable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicentre randomise phase II trial . Patients initially register either induction chemotherapy , response use determine whether eligible randomisation . All patient ask consent archival tissue collection translational analysis provide translational blood sample . The second consent precede randomisation one two group maintenance therapy ( olaparib placebo ) 1:1 randomisation objectively measure complete partial response follow standard chemotherapy . Randomised patient receive olaparib placebo disease progression . They monitor CT scan every two cycle disease progression , manage accord local practice . Follow maximum 12 month point randomisation disease progression . All randomise patient baseline translational blood sample ask provide follow blood sample upon randomisation radiological progression . Registered patient progressive disease initial induction chemotherapy ask provide follow-up blood sample end induction chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
