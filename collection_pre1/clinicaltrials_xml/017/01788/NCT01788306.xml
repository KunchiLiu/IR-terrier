	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomized emergency department trial study effectiveness intervention combine opioid overdose prevention , education intervention include take home naloxone brief behavioral change counseling . The study recruit heroin user ( n=500 ) pharmaceutical opioid user elevate risk overdose ( n=500 ) . Outcomes interest include subsequent opioid overdoses overdose risk behavior . Primary Aims The primary aim test whether receive intervention compare standard care : 1 ) Lower rate opioid non-fatal fatal overdose ; 2 ) Reduce drug use , inappropriate medication use , overdose risk behavior . Secondary Aims The secondary aim test whether receive intervention compare standard care : 3 ) More appropriate health care utilization ( e.g . few emergency department visit admission inpatient care ) ; 4 ) Lower total health care cost ; 5 ) Determine prevalence HIV risk behavior among heroin pharmaceutical opioid user risk overdose whether intervention impact behavior .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Project OOPEN : Opioid Overdose Prevention , Education Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatal overdose involve pharmaceutical opioids increase dramatically past decade , surpass related heroin , lead cause drug overdose much U.S . In Seattle-King County , 75 % drug overdose involve pharmaceutical opioids and/or heroin 2009 . Opioid overdoses , heroin pharmaceutical , preventable reversible . Research indicate drug user partner successfully train recognize reverse overdose naloxone ( opioid antagonist medicine `` antidote '' ) . Despite active heroin overdose prevention , education intervention program naloxone ( OOPEN ) 15 state thousand overdose reversal serious adverse event , rigorous study program rate subsequent heroin overdoses conduct . No OOPEN program study yet implement pharmaceutical opioid user elevate risk overdose . The Emergency Department ( ED ) set hold great promise identify recruiting elevate risk heroin pharmaceutical opioid overdose : 1 ) ED study site proposal provide service need care acute opioid related medical problem Seattle , 2 ) patient ' need urgent medical attention may heighten concern potential harm opioids . Unique set potential identify high risk pharmaceutical opioid user , population difficult locate engage . ED intervention use brief behavior change counseling ( BBCC ) show significantly improve health behavior alcohol use injury , increase entry drug treatment well reduce cost . Evidence promising , limited , regard impact BBCC opioid relate risk behavior . This prospective , randomized ED trial study effectiveness intervention combine OOPEN BBCC heroin user ( n=500 ) pharmaceutical opioid user elevate risk overdose ( n=500 ) . The primary outcome subsequent opioid overdoses , ascertain follow interview conduct 3 , 6 12 month well via administrative record 24 month ( i.e . medical record , ambulance response , death certificate ) . Primary Aims The primary aim test whether receive intervention compare standard care : 1 ) Lower rate opioid non-fatal fatal overdose ; 2 ) Reduce drug use , inappropriate medication use , overdose risk behavior . Secondary Aims The secondary aim test whether receive intervention compare standard care : 3 ) More appropriate health care utilization ( e.g . few emergency department visit admission inpatient care ) ; 4 ) Lower total health care cost ; 5 ) Determine prevalence HIV risk behavior among heroin pharmaceutical opioid user risk overdose whether intervention impact behavior .</detailed_description>
