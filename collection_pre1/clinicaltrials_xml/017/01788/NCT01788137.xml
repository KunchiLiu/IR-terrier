	<detailed_description>This prospective , open , multicenter , randomize phase III study . We plan include 380 untreated high risk T cell lymphoma adult , random CHOP c-ATT regimen group signature inform consent . The patient receive safety assessment every cycle , efficacy evaluation every 3 cycle . Every-two-months follow receive finishing treatment . - randomization Subjects randomly assign 1 2 treatment group base computer-generated randomization schedule prepare study . - Dosage administration - Treatment Arm A ( CHOP ) : cyclophosphamide ( C ) , 750mg/m2 injection day1 ; doxorubicin ( H ) , 50 mg/m 2 injection day1 ; Vincristine ( O ) , 1.4 mg/ m2 injection day1 , prednisone ( P ) 60 mg/m2 orally day 1 5 . The therapy repeat every 21 day total 6 cycle . - Treatment Arm B ( c-ATT ) : Alternative 3 regimen use sequentially ( CHOPB→IMVP-16→DHAP ) .The therapy repeat every 21 day total 6 cycle . patient bulky disease extranodal lesion wil receive radiotherapy finishing chemotherapy . - Study evaluation - Criteria response category Tumour response evaluate accord International Workshop Standardize Response Criteria Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphomas ( 1998 ) - Efficacy Criteria Disease-free survival Disease-free survival patient CR CRu measure first assessment document response date disease progression recent follow-up visit time . Response rate Response rate define proportion subject achieve CR/Cru PR relative total population.Overall survival Overall survival measure entry onto study death cause , recent follow-up visit date - Scheduling tumour assessment Baseline total tumour burden must assess within maximum 21 day first dose treatment.Follow-up tumour evaluation perform last week every 3rd cycle . After finish therapy , tumor evaluation perform every 3 month first second year , follow every 6 month 2years . tumour assessment may perform CT/MRI internal organ lesion . In case clinically measurable superficial lesion , accurate evidence perform original record . - Clinical Safety Assessments The following , safety , assessment procedure perform accord schedule assessment : - A complete medical history ( include demographic , smoke history , cancer/treatment history ) perform screen . - Physical examination* - ECG - Weight - Blood pressure - heart rate - respiratory rate - ECOG Score - Infection sign Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) report accord NCI-CTC criterion . Patients assessed adverse event clinical visit necessary throughout study . - Laboratory Safety Assessments The following complete accord schedule assessment : - Hæmoglobin - Haematocrit - Leucocytes - Neutrophils - Platelets - Serum electrolyte ( K+ , Ca++ ) - Serum chemistry ( Total bilirubin , ALT [ SGPT ] , AST [ SGOT ] , total protein , albumin , LDH , alkaline phosphatase , urea [ BUN ] , serum creatinine , creatinine clearance ) . - Dipstick urinalysis . In case significant finding , microscopic urinalysis perform . Note : Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) report accord NCI-CTC criterion ( Version 3.0 ) Patients assessed adverse event clinical visit necessary throughout study . - Follow-up Patients study reassessed completion treatment minimum every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month completion study.assessment content follow-up visit include history , physical examination , blood picture , Urinalysis , liver kidney function tumor assessment . - Statistical analyze The propose regimen consider worthy additional investigation patient population disease control rate 15 % great . The total sample size 368 patient ( collect 380 evaluable patient , consider drop-out rate around 10 % , group number : 190 ) . Treatment duration define day first day drug administration last regulated rest day final cycle. , Primary objective overall survival d. Secondary objectives response rate , safety disease free survival Response rate estimate use binomial probability exact 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) provide . disease free survival overall survival curve estimate use Kaplan-Meier methodology . Adverse event laboratory test grade accord NCI-CTC AE ( Version 3 ) .Adverse event assign preferred term categorize body system accord MEDDRA classification WHO terminology</detailed_description>
