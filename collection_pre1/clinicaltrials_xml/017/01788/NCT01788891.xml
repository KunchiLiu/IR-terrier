	<detailed_description>Children resource-limited setting increase experience treatment failure , define virologic , immunologic , and/or clinical criterion . There study HIV resistance mutation child fail first line NNRTI therapy resource limit setting . The emergence treatment failure drug resistance child ART emphasize urgency develop evidence-based second-line salvage treatment strategy . Pediatric treatment complicate number factor , include few number ARVs approve drug safety agency lack pediatric formulation . This shortens list available second-line ARVs compare adult . Despite grow number child second-line therapy worldwide , limited data efficacy second-line PI therapy child NRTI-NNRTI failure . There currently option third-line/salvage regimens child resource-limited setting . New drug drug class approve use child US FDA routinely available outside high-income setting . Also , data resistance pattern child fail second-line therapy resource-limited setting guide clinical management ARV procurement . Clinicians need evidence-based guideline manage child treatment failure , access drug necessary construct potent durable third-line regimen . TASER-P longitudinal observational cohort study monitor treatment failure second-line ART Asian child .</detailed_description>
