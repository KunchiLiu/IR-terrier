	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : This study design integral part development new improve feature component Bravo® pH Monitoring System may serve verification validation purpose . The study population include symptomatic patient know suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease Symptomatic patient undergo invasive procedure , include Bravo capsule delivery , position attachment . Confirmation capsule attachment may do endoscopically . These procedure serve evaluate overall system performance actual clinical setup , instance : ergonomics performance delivery device , capsule transmission etc . Physician may ask provide feedback procedure and/or document activity procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population consist symptomatic patient know suspected gastro esophageal reflux disease . The aim clinical study evaluate Bravo® pH Monitoring System . Primary objectives - To evaluate usability functionality Bravo® pH Monitoring System procedure - To evaluate modification Bravo delivery device Primary Endpoints 1 . Evaluate physician subjective assessment questionnaire ( appendix 3 ) 2 . Percentage successful capsule attachment Patients undergo standard-of-care Bravo pH procedure . Prior pH study , patient eat drink minimum 6 hour , accord standard system instruction . - Bravo procedure may take 48-96 hour - Patients follow-up visit call , one two week procedure - A fluoroscopy procedure may order physician 's discretion verify capsule attachment \ detachment patient 's esophagus Over expect duration subject 's participation study maximum 1 month Physician may ask provide feedback procedure usability functionality document activity procedure .</detailed_description>
