	<brief_summary>This interventional open prospective randomize study , do two site . The main purpose study evaluate efficacy combination bipolar radiofrequency potentiate infrared light follow fractional bipolar radiofrequency treatment striae abdomen . In order complete accurate study , technology also evaluate separately . This allow comparison effect treatment , monotherapy combine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Fractional Bipolar Radiofrequency Treatment Striae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stria common condition affect psychologically aesthetically lot patient . It linear atrophic scar . So , treat , need superficial deep impact . Several technology already test indication , none prove time effective without high risk side effect skin type . As radiofrequency electrical current , absorbed see melanin . So used skin type . When use fractional bipolar radiofrequency , current go small electrode return electrode . Around small electrode appear epidermal ablation , coagulation deeper thermal damage . This mean superficial deep effect . Using infrared combine bipolar radiofrequency allow infrared pre-heat skin help radiofrequency go deep skin easily . This deep effect dermis . In study , technology use . At least 20 patient treat two different site . The abdomen patient divide four quadrant around navel . Each quadrant receive total three treatment one month apart : - One quadrant control ( treatment do ) - One quadrant receive time bipolar radiofrequency potentiate infrared - One quadrant receive time fractional bipolar radiofrequency - One quadrant receive time first bipolar radiofrequency potentiate infrared , follow session fractional bipolar radiofrequency . The choice treatment area randomize enrollment patient study . There two follow-up session 3 6 month last treatment . The evaluation do mainly 3D acquisition . This allow measuring length , width depth stria evaluate evolution treatment . Some patient , agree , also vivo confocal microscopy first treatment 6 month last one . This give information collagen elastin change . Four patient , accept , biopsy perform first treatment 6 month last one also show evolution skin structure .</detailed_description>
