	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine safety effect immune system treatment GSK2245035 subject suffer nasal symptom cause allergy pollen perennial allergen , without mild asthma . In addition , effect treatment GSK2245035 body 's allergic response test situation explore . Approximately 28 subject receive GSK2245035 ( 14 subject receive 80 nanograms [ ng ] GSK2245035 14 subject receive 20 ng GSK2245035 ) 14 subject receive dummy drug ( placebo ) study . Assignment subject GSK2245035 placebo do chance , like flip coin . Neither subject clinic staff know whether subject dose GSK2245035 placebo course study . The study include ( ) Screening phase eligibility subject enrolment assess ( b ) Treatment phase subject receive either 8 nasal spray GSK2245035 80 ng match placebo weekly 8 week ( dose split two nostril ) . Subjects participate study 2014 receive reduce dose 20 ng i.n . GSK2245035 weekly eight administration ( c ) Follow-up period GSK2245035 induce change immune system effect treatment body 's allergic response test situation monitor . The maximum planned study duration subject , include screening , treatment follow-up period , approximately 180 day .</brief_summary>

A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include investigator agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure Body weight &gt; =45 kilogram ( kg ) History symptomatic pollen perennial allergen drive allergic rhinitis without mild asthma ( clear link exposure allergen development symptom ) 2 year Positive skin allergy test ( wheal &gt; =3 mm [ millimeter ] ) serum allergenspecific Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) ( &gt; =class 2 ) perennial allergen and/or pollen allergen , relevant area research unit , within year study start Positive screening nasal allergen challenge , define Total nasal symptom score ( TNSS ) response &gt; =5 ( 12 point scale ) decrease Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow ( PNIF ) &gt; 30 % Males nonpregnant nonlactating female 18 65 year age inclusive time sign consent form A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential , define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy , postmenopausal , define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 million international unit ( MIU ) /mL estradiol &lt; 40 picogram ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; 147 picomoles ( pmol ) /liter ( L ) confirmatory ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method failure rate &lt; 1 % wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method A female subject eligible participate childbearing potential negative early pregnancy test screening , confirm menses and/or negative early pregnancy test within 10 day prior first dose visit , negative early pregnancy test dose agrees : use one require contraception method failure rate &lt; 1 % start least 2 week prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . The subject must agree use contraception four day last dosing ; samesex partner , prefer usual lifestyle Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method : Condom plus partner use require highly effective contraceptive ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) ; Abstinence , define sexual inactivity consistent preferred usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g . calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication four day last dose CRITERIA BASED UPON MEDICAL HISTORIES History immunological disorder disease ( include , limited , malignancy , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , hematological , neurological , endocrine pulmonary disease ) opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) medical monitor may pose additional risk factor Nasal condition accord opinion investigator may affect outcome study , i.e . nasal septal perforation , nasal polyp , nasal malformation history frequent nosebleed Respiratory tract infection within 4 week prior first dose History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : average weekly intake &gt; 21 drink male &gt; 12 drink female .

( Subjects receive incomplete treatment allergenspecific immunotherapy 5 year ago may include discretion investigator GSK Medical Monitor ) Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day prior first dose throughout treatment followup period unless opinion investigator and/or GSK medical monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Acetaminophen exception permit daily dos 2 g screen followup . Approved contraceptives preapproved medication specify protocol also exempt Subjects use steroid treatment allergic rhinitis and/or asthma may participate study remain free medication throughout treatment followup period start follow period time prior screening : Nasal steroids4 week , Oral steroids12 week , Inhaled steroids4 week Subjects use medication allergic rhinitis and/or asthma need basis may participate study abstain : Xanthines ( include theophylline , include caffeine ) , anticholinergic , cromoglycates , leukotriene antagonist , 5lipoxygenase inhibitor longacting inhaled betaagonists 1 week prior screen throughout treatment followup period ; Nasal antihistamines48 hour prior visit ; Oral antihistamines76 hour prior visit ; Nasal decongestants24 hour prior visit ; Oral decongestants24 hour prior visit ; Short act inhaled betaagonists48 hour prior visit CRITERIA BASED UPON DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen A positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody A positive screening predose drug/alcohol screen , follow exception : ( ) Subjects positive result initial drug screening exclude unless previously disclose use prescription drug could cause positive drug screen accord opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor pose safety risk subject compromise study ( b ) Subjects positive marijuana ( THC ) screen may enter study investigator 's discretion predose drug screen must negative ( c ) Subjects positive alcohol screen may test repeat subsequent screen visit predose alcohol screen must negative .
