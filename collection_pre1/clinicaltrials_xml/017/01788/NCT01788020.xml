	<brief_summary>In Waldenström macroglobulinemia ( WM ) conventional chemotherapy induces low CR rate responses short duration compare indolent lymphoma . Thus innovative approach need combine excellent activity tolerability patient WM , mostly advanced age . The immunochemotherapy DRC ( dexamethasone , rituximab , cyclophosphamide ) show highly effective patient WM without induce major hematological toxicity . On hand proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib show substantial activity single agent WM side effect give weekly schedule . Based observation aim study test whether efficacy well tolerate DRC regime improve add Bortezomib .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia ( WM ) define bone marrow infiltration lymphoplasmacytic cell presence monoclonal immunoglobulin ( Ig ) M gammopathy peripheral blood 1 . The clinical understanding disease greatly improve identification internationally recognize criterion initiate therapy 2 , description international prognostic index patient require first-line therapy3 definition response criterion . These criterion mainly base evolution serum IgM concentration4 . However , delay IgM monoclonal protein response may cause important difficulty response assessment4 . In addition , discrepancy kinetics serum M protein reduction clearance monoclonal B-cells bone marrow report 5 . Despite continuing advance therapy WM , disease remain incurable median survival 5 8 year time diagnosis thereby necessitate development evaluation novel treatment approach .</detailed_description>

In addition , pathological specimen send national pathological reference center study inclusion randomization . The positivity CD20 assume previous bone marrow immunohistochemistry flow cytometry analysis perform 6 month prior enrollment . Inclusion study base morphological immunological criterion . Immunophenotyping perform center save locally . Flow cytometry bone marrow blood cell include least one double stain assess expression follow antigen : surface immunoglobulin , CD19 , CD20 , CD5 , CD10 CD23 . Patients eligible tumor cell express follow antigen : CD19 , CD20 , negative CD5 , CD10 CD23 expression .
