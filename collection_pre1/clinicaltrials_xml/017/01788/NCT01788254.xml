	<brief_summary>Aim study comprehensively assess healthy volunteer metabolic process factor define drug response . Sources variability investigate factor alter hepatic metabolism pharmacokinetics drug shall quantify . Determination variability important pharmacokinetics new drug investigate concept individualized medicine develop . It important identify differentiate pharmaceutical , physiological ( e.g . liver blood flow , renal function ) , environmental ( e.g . food lifestyle ) , genetic source inter-individual variability . For instance , inaccurate false conclusion may draw single pharmacokinetic study , investigated medicine metabolize enzyme large inter-individual variability . Knowing cause variability quantitative contribution various process might help improve oral formulation drug , might help select right preclinical test selection criterion clinical development , provide basis understand influence disease optimize establish drug treatment order make future drug treatment safer efficient . This study design add-on study `` TWINS : Open Label Repeated Dose Study Evaluation Heritability Genetic Influences Drug Pharmacokinetics '' ( Eudra-CT : 2008-006223-31 ) . Twins random sample population , differ developmental environment . In sense representative population Thus , result TWINS automatically generalize instead require validation representative population sample . While study assess pharmacologic factor important drug response , TWINS contribute particular data heritability process .</brief_summary>
