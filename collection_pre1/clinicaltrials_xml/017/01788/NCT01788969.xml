	<brief_summary>The manifestation weakness involuntary reflex follow motor incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) may partly result damage descend pathway spinal cord release serotonin . In model SCI , example , application agent simulate serotonin show modulate voluntary motor behavior , include augmentation walking recovery . In human follow neurological injury , effect 5HT agent unclear . Few previous report indicate improve motor function follow administration agent enhance available serotonin brain , although data suggests decrease serotonin may beneficial . In application , investigator propose study effect clinically use agent increase decrease intrinsic serotonin activity brain strength walk ability follow human motor incomplete SCI . Using detailed electrophysiological recording , biomechanical behavioral measure , investigator determine effect acute chronic dos drug voluntary involuntary motor behavior static dynamic condition . The novelty propose research expectation agent enhance serotonin activity may increase abnormal reflex SCI , simultaneously facilitate motor walk recovery . Despite potential improvement voluntary function , use pharmacological agent may enhance spastic motor behavior follow SCI mark contrast way drug typically use clinical setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study consist double-blinded , randomize control trial use crossover design assess effect SSRIs ( escitalopram oxalate , Lexapro® , Forest Pharmaceuticals , Inc ) 5HT-antagonists ( cyproheptadine [ CYPRO ] , Periactin ® , Merck , Inc ) volitional spastic motor behavior subject motor incomplete SCI follow acute chronic medication delivery . Voluntary reflexive motor behavior 120 subject SCI assess . These intervention apply individual acute ( &lt; 6 month post injury ) chronic ( &gt; 1 year post injury ) motor incomplete SCI determine rate extent change volitional motor performance involuntary spastic behavior . For train portion study ( refer subproject 2 ) , portion acute chronic subject evaluate every 2 week to16 week participate locomotor training , investigate good understand change motor function recovery individual spinal cord injury . Following 2-4 week training , individual give either study drug , placebo continue evaluation training . Following additional 4 week , subject give either placebo study drug ( whichever receive prior 4 week ) . The order randomize .</detailed_description>
