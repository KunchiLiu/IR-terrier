	<brief_summary>The objective study provide pain relief patient facet joint disease head neck pain related compression nerve root . The goal provide palliative care superior efficacy longer relief compare current method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI-Guided Cryoablation Alleviate Pain Head , Neck Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nerve ablation use therapeutically produce temporary anesthesia diagnostically locate source pain . Ablation , purposeful destruction tissue , relieve facet joint pain pain relate nerve damage disable pain-transmitting nerve . Cryoablation pain management particularly useful modality difficult perform high incidence complication side effect . Currently nerve ablation perform bupivacaine alcohol , MRI-guided cryoablation nerve facet may result superior efficacy longer relief . Cryotherapy technique provide long term analgesia help alleviate intractable pain patient facet joint pain neuralgia . Minimally invasive Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) -guided ablation nerve facet may lead decreased procedure time increase relief pain due cancer nerve degeneration . With advent Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating Suite ( AMIGO ) Brigham Women 's Hospital , exceptional capability minimally invasive image-guided procedure , include different ablation technique . The AMIGO suite equip hardware keep patient stationary Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner move patient . Additionally , monitor software within AMIGO suite allows clinicians instantaneously analyze image information significantly reduce risk injury adjacent structure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must willing able sign write informed consent document . Patients must facet joint disease pain due damage compressed nerve would benefit minimally invasive imageguided procedure ( i.e. , adjacent critical structure , good visualize 3 Tesla MRI CT ) Subjects must able adhere visit schedule attend pre post imaging . Participants must least 18 year age Participants must estimate life expectancy &gt; 8 week opinion clinician . Patients radiculopathy must cause pain confirm nerve block within 3 month prior ablation Contraindications MRI Gadolinium ( i.e . estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt; 60ml/min , metal clip ) Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude research .</criteria>
