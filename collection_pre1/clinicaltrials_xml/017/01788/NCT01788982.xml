	<brief_summary>For treatment thyroid cancer call target therapy angiogenesis pathway several potential target . The Receptors Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) especially VEGFR-2 consider crucial initiation formation well maintenance tumor vasculature . In thyroid cancer VEGF receptor ( VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 ) , VEGF receptor fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) often overexpressed . Other cell pericytes smooth muscle cell also involve tumor angiogenesis express receptor well . Inhibitors VEGFR PDGFR pathway test thyroid cancer positive result . However treatment generally consider standard care patient differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) medullar thyroid cancer ( MTC ) progress one line therapy . The classical cytotoxic chemotherapy show clinically meaningful benefit yet . Nintedanib triple angiogenesis inhibitor inhibit receptor VEGF , FGF PDGF . Therefore might act endothelial cell also pericytes smooth muscle cell . Nintedanib also interact kinase RET . Because multi-kinase activity rationale exist investigate effect MTC DTC . Because target three major angiogenesis signal pathway might prevent tumor growth related tumor escape mechanism . Therefore nintedanib may active patient progress agent target one pathway .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm differentiate medullary thyroid cancer local pathologist . Available tumor tissue time initial diagnosis histology review . The provision tumor tissue histology review mandatory every patient/site . Locally advanced metastatic disease deem incurable surgery , radiotherapy and/or radioactive iodine ( RAI ) . No current symptomatic brain metastasis previously present , must treat least two month randomization . CT MRI scan brain mandatory ( within 4 week prior randomization ) ass presence brain metastasis . Patients must measurable lesion document progression 12 month prior randomization , accord RECIST V.1.1 . Patients withdraw first line treatment due toxicity without documented disease progression receive placebo ( context clinical trial ) prior treatment eligible . Patients must receive one 2 prior line treatment ( two ) must treatment least 4 week prior randomization . Age ≥18 year . Performance status ( PS ) 01 ( WHO , Appendix C ) . Life expectancy 12 week . No history malignancy within last 5 year , except adequately treat carcinoma situ cervix basal cell spinocellular carcinoma skin . No ongoing treatment related toxicity due prior treatment &gt; grade I ( except alopecia ) . Adequate organ function , evidence follow laboratory result within 3 week prior randomization : ( patient buffer range normal value +/ 5 % hematology +/ 10 % biochemistry [ EXCEPTION Glomerular Filtration Rate ] acceptable ) Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500 cells/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.5 g/dL Total bilirubin within normal limit SGOT ( AST ) , SGPT ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 1.5× ULN ( ≤ 2.5× ULN ) case presence liver metastasis ) Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) ≥ 45 ml/min accord Cockcroft Gault Formula ( see Appendix E. ) . Proteinuria CTCAE &lt; 2 Coagulation parameter : International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 2 , prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN No history significant cardiac disease define : Symptomatic CHF ( NYHA class IIIIV , see Appendix D ) Highrisk uncontrolled arrhythmia , i.e . atrial tachycardia heart rate &gt; 100/min rest , significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia ) highergrade AVblock ( second degree AVblock Type 2 [ Mobitz 2 ] third degree AVblock ) No prolongation correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 msec , History myocardial infarction within 12 month prior randomization Clinically significant valvular heart disease No angina pectoris require antiangina treatment No current uncontrolled hypertension ( persistent systolic &gt; 180 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg ) ( without medication ) . Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . No evidence active bleeding bleed diathesis . No cerebrovascular accident time past , transient ischemic attack , deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism past 6 month . Therapeutic anticoagulation ( except lowdose heparin and/or heparin flush need maintenance indwell intravenous devise ) antiplatelet therapy ( except lowdose therapy acetylsalicylic acid &lt; 325mg per day ) allow . No history clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder include : malabsorption syndrome , major resection stomach small bowel could affect absorption study drug , active peptic ulcer disease , know intraluminal metastatic lesion risk bleeding , inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation . No history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day prior begin study treatment . No current severe , uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , metabolic disease ; wound heal disorder ; ulcer ; bone fracture , know infection HIV , active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus ) systemic disease/symptoms may hamper compliance study protocol , accord physician 's judgment . No major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior randomization anticipation need major surgery course study treatment and/or presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer . No history receive investigational treatment within 28 day prior randomization . Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum ( urine ) pregnancy test within 72 hour prior first dose study treatment . Patients childbearing / reproductive potential use adequate birth control measure , define investigator , study treatment period least 6 month last study treatment . A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Female subject breast feed discontinue nursing prior first dose study treatment 6 month last study treatment . Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient registration trial . Before patient registration/randomization , write informed consent must give accord ICH/GCP , national/local regulation . Tissue availability central confirmation histological diagnosis mandatory . All TR project optional patient separate consent form provide patient .</criteria>
