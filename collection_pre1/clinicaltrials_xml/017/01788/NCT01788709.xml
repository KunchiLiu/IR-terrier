	<detailed_description>Abstract : Colorectal cancer amongst lead cancer worldwide . Treatment greatly dependent stage illness , favorable outcome associate early cancer . For reason , screen colonoscopy increase , effort improve quality bowel preparation . The colonoscopy accuracy safety depend quality colon cleansing . An inadequately prepped bowel increase risk miss lesion , prolong procedure , increase patient discomfort , eventually increase complication rate . Hence , Ideal bowel cleanse solution would quickly reliably clean colon good tolerability palatability patient . Current colonoscopy preparation regimen require use large volume iso-osmotic PEG-electrolyte solution adequate cleanse often poorly tolerated patient . We show previously mentholyptus drop significantly improve palatability PEG-electrolyte ( Fortrans® ) solution quality preparation ( 1 ) . We aim study compare efficacy above-mentioned prep technique reduce volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte ( MoviPrep® ) . This randomize controlled trial include patient undergoing elective colonoscopy American University Beirut Medical Center . Patients randomize one two study arm use computer generate randomization list . 100 Patients ask candy ( Halls® ) whole 2 hour period drink PEG solution ( Fortrans® ) . Another 100 patient ask take reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte ( MoviPrep® ) . All patient interview research coordinator evaluate tolerability preparation take account palatability solution main outcome remain volume PEG solution side effect secondary outcome . Based result pilot study , sample size calculation show 100 patient per arm enough attain significance . As statistical analysis , SPSS version 20.0 use data entry analysis . I- Aim : To compare efficacy split PEG-electrolyte ( Fortrans® ) mentholyptus ( Halls® ) drop reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte ( MoviPrep® ) improve palatability solution use bowel cleanse colonoscopy . II- Background : The colonoscopy accuracy safety depend quality colon cleansing . An inadequately prepped bowel increase risk miss lesion , prolong procedure , increase patient discomfort , eventually increase complication rate . Therefore excellent colon cleanse extreme importance endoscopist patient . Hence , An Ideal bowel cleanse solution would quickly reliably clean colon good tolerability palatability patient . Poor tolerability patient would increase risk finish whole solution hence risk poor colon cleanse . Many type bowel cleanse solution currently available market . Current colonoscopy preparation regimen require use large volume iso-osmotic PEG-electrolyte solution adequate cleanse often poorly tolerated patient . Therefore , improve tolerability solution patient critical importance . The main side effect bowel cleanse solution nausea , vomit , bloating , cramp . To decrease incidence therefore improve tolerability , one could either decrease volume solution improve palatability . Many study try decrease volume solution standard 4 liter . These study largely show small volume prep inferior standard prep . In addition , study show improve palatability add flavor improve patient ' acceptance solution ( 2-6 ) . MoviPrep® liquid PEG bowel cleanse agent incorporates ascorbic acid formulation , thus contribute lemon taste consequently well patient tolerability . We prove earlier year randomize trial high palatability hence well quality preparation ( 90 % Good/Excellent ) use PEG-electrolyte Fortrans® sugar-free mentholyptus drop ( Halls® ) ( 6 ) . We aim compare colonoscopy preparation quality palatability technique MoviPrep® single blind randomized trial . III- Hypothesis : Split Fortrans® prep sugar-free mentholyptus drop ( Halls® ) good palatability tolerability reduce volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte ( MoviPrep® ) bowel cleanse colonoscopy . IV- Setting : Single university base center ( American University Beirut Medical Center ) V- Study Design : Prospective randomize single-blinded study VI- Methods : 1 . Study population : 1 . Inclusion criterion : ● Elective colonoscopy - Consent study 2 . Exclusion criterion : ● Pregnant lactate woman ● Age le 18 year ● Significant gastroparesis ● Gastric outlet obstruction ● Ileus ● Known suspect bowel obstruction perforation ● Phenylketonuria - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency - Severe chronic renal failure ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/minute ) - Severe congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] class III IV ) - Dehydration - Severe acute inflammatory disease - Compromised swallow reflex mental status - Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ≥170 mm Hg , diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg ) - Toxic colitis megacolon These exclusion criterion consistent contraindication currently approve bowel preparation ; therefore , result study may generalize entire target population patient undergo colonoscopy , include elderly . 2 . Randomization : Patients enrol principal investigator study coordinator ( MD ) assess inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients randomize one two study arm use pre-set randomization list patient odd number last digit medical record assign control arm patient even number assign intervention arm . 3 . Study arm : ● First arm : 4 Liters PEG solution ( FORTRANS® ) split 2 day sugar-free mentholyptus drop ( 2 L 7-9 pm day prior colonoscopy Halls® , 2 L day colonoscopy complete least 1.5 hour procedure Halls® ) . ● Second arm : 2 Liters reduce volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte ( MoviPrep® ) + 1 Liter clear fluid patient ' choice split 2 day ( 1 L MoviPrep® evening day prior colonoscopy + 500 mL clear fluid patient choice , another 1 L MoviPrep® + 500 mL clear fluid day colonoscopy complete least 1 hour procedure . ) 4 . Instructions patient : Patients arm instruct take colonoscopy preparation solution , emphasize importance complete intake solution order ensure safe effective procedure . In case noncompliance , remainder PEG solution shall bring patient assessment . They also instruct regular breakfast lunch meal day prior colonoscopy , full fluid dinner , stay NPO except colon prep midnight till time colonoscopy . 5 . Assessment tolerability : Immediately prior colonoscopy , patient study arm interview research coordinator evaluate tolerability preparation . Patients assess : - Primary outcome : - Quality preparation : score 1 4 1 . 2 3 4 Poor Fair Good Excellent - Secondary outcome : - Estimated volume remain original PEG solution - Palatability : score 1 5 1 . 2 3 4 5 Disgusting Moderately poor taste Slightly poor taste Acceptable Tasty In addition follow adverse event : - Nausea - Vomiting - Bloating - Cramps - Headache - General acceptance solution - Willingness take preparation future necessary VII- Sample size calculation data analysis : Sample size calculation conduct base previously conduct study show 90 % good/excellent prep Fortrans® + Halls® report result colonoscopy preparation use reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte ( MoviPrep® ) range 65-85 % good/excellent ( average : 75 % ) ( 1 ) ( 7-10 ) . Therefore , base result use α 0.05 power 0.80 , sample size require show significance calculate 97 patient per arm . Hence , decide recruit 100 patient per arm taking account possible withdrawal . For statistical analysis , SPSS version 20.0 use data entry analysis . The primary end point quality preparation assess endoscopist ( blind preparation technique ) . Secondary end point : palatability , residual volume , patient assessment quality preparation , willingness retake preparation solution need . VIII- Study Interval : 1 year start enrollment first patient</detailed_description>
