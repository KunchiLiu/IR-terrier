	<detailed_description>Introduction : Unexplained infertility define lack thec ability become pregnant first year , although period woman , semen man laparoscopic finding normal . In Denmark roughly every fifth seven couple fertile age problem become pregnant various kind reason , 10-15 % unexplained infertile . Many factor point import . In particularly lifestyle factor diet , smock , obesity , lack physic activity alcohol . The causal connection yet find , assumed link infertility endocrine , neurological immunological factor . Asthma allergy common disease among young people western world .The development disease cause hereditary factor , factor also seem important infertility . It clinically observe many unexplained infertile patient simultaneously suffer asthma allergy . Furthermore group patient seem hard treat term become pregnant fertility treatment healthy asthmatic non allergic person . There limited available data subject data already collect show clear tendency . Hypothesis : Atopic asthma characterize systemic inflammation therefore reason infertility among group patient . The aim : The aim study examine whether female asthmatic allergic less fertile healthy females- whether link asthma infertility . Furthermore optimal asthma treatment fertility treatment reduces time pregnancy . The design : The project divide 3 part : 1 . A Study Population . In first part project aim evaluate occurrence asthmatic allergic disease among woman respectively normal fertility infertility . This do data already collect The Danish twin Study 1998- 2002 concern question asthma , hay fever , atopic eczema number child . 2 . A Prospective Study In second part project aim examine clinically , whether female asthmatic general difficulty become pregnant non- asthmatic female . Furthermore aim evaluate whether allergic non allergic asthma affect fertility . 3 . Casual study In third part project include 40 unexplained infertile female collect earlier- 10 female asthma , 10 female allergy , 10 female asthma allergy , 10 without atopic disease.These woman , addition initial asthma allergy diagnosis , make suction mucus uterus , ovulate . This order determine whether environment uterus different term inflammation atopics . The aim study find explanation possible decreased pregnancy rate long time pregnancy atopics . Material : 396 unexplained infertile female include , start treatment fertility clinic . Among 197 healthy unexplained infertile female 197 female combination asthma unexplained infertility . They include due specific inclusion exclusion criterion . Methods : All subject inclusion test asthma bronchial provocation test . The pulmonary function measure severity possible asthma examine NO expire air . Blood sample ( RAS test ) prick test perform evaluate possible allergy status . All subject fill questionnaires concern asthma , allergy infertility . Due test mention subject divide group , asthmatic , allergics , atopics non- atopics . The female asthmatic treat due international guideline . All group follow till achieve pregnancy ; time pregnancy compared.Â¨ In third part study suction mucus uterus make time ovulation , determinate level inflammation atopics versus non atopics time fertilization.The mucus examine fore inflammatory marker relate atopy TNF alpha , IL4,5,6,8and 33 .</detailed_description>
