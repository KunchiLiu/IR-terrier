	<brief_summary>This research conduct preterm newborn 'in utero ' growth restriction due inadequate blood flow mother baby . These deprived baby adapt conducive uterine environment certain adjustment blood supply internal organ thereby permit best possible blood flow brain heart etc. , vital organ whose adequate functioning require survival . In bargain gut ( intestine ) get poor blood supply hence appropriate functioning jeopardized . In past baby ( birth ) feed day together compromise growth even . Premature growth restrict ' baby increase risk growth falter feed time also condition call 'Necrotising enterocolitis ' feed liberally like healthy neonate , characterize abdominal distension , blood stool inability fee much long duration thereby affect growth . This study evaluate feed schedule early versus late initiation feed arrive best time feed doubly jeopardized premature growth restrict baby avert mentioned consequence . No study conduct India confirm aforementioned fact hence study plan . The information learn study help u fee small premature well growth restrict baby AREDF well go long way care preterm growth restrict newborn .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Initiation Feeding Preterm Newborns With Prenatal AREDF Umbilical Artery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Absence reversal end diastolic flow ( AREDF ) umbilical artery associate poor outcome . This exaggerated presence intrauterine growth retardation oligohydramnios . Elective premature delivery fetuses common . AREDF lead circulatory redistribution decrease blood flow lung , intestine , kidney , skin , muscle , blood divert brain , myocardium adrenal . This reduction visceral perfusion associate increase risk necrotising enterocolitis , cerebral haemorrhage , neonatal morbidity . Because concern feeding may increase risk necrotizing enterocolitis , high-risk infant ( study preterm AGA ) receive prolonged period parenteral nutrition without enteral feeding . Providing trophic feeding ( small volume feeding give rate least 5 day ) period parenteral nutrition develop strategy enhance feed tolerance decrease time reach full feeding . Whether trophic feeding result good outcome initially withhold feeding provide progressively increase feeding establish proper clinical trial . There standard guideline fee preterm SGA infant born mother abnormal antenatal Doppler study . Furthermore , randomized trial feed strategy group neonates hence plan carry study comparison early versus delay initiation feed preterm SGA infant AREDF . The purpose study compare time reach full enteral feed , time regain birth weight etc . baby feed carefully versus fed initial day . It postulate early gut priming may stimulate gut secrete certain trophic growth factor may make good able tolerate enteral feed improve overall growth also reduce chance infection .</detailed_description>
