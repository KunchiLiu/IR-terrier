	<brief_title>A Study Assess Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics , Safety Canagliflozin ( JNJ-28431754 ) Volunteers With Varying Degrees Kidney Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open label ( volunteer study staff know identity assign treatment ) , single-dose , multicenter ( study conduct one center ) , parallel-group study ( group volunteer treat time ) ass pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics canagliflozin ( drug currently investigate treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus ) volunteer vary degree kidney function . The study consist 3 phase : screening phase , open-label treatment phase , end-of study ( follow-up ) phase . Volunteers assign 1 5 group ( depend kidney function ) : group 1 normal kidney function ; group 2 mild kidney impairment ; group 3 moderate kidney impairment ; group 4 severe kidney impairment ; group 5 comprise volunteer require hemodialysis . Volunteers group 1 4 receive single dose canagliflozin Day 1 . Volunteers group 5 receive single dose canagliflozin follow dialysis , approximately 10 day later , receive second dose dialysis . Volunteers group 1 4 participate study 27 day . Volunteers group 5 participate study 40 day .</detailed_description>
