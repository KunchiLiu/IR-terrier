	<brief_title>Perioperative Aminophylline Improve Early Kidney Function After Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomize , clinical trial evaluate whether administration aminophylline start pretransplant post-transplant day 5 improves early kidney function project also long term graft function . Study Arms intervention : On admit hospital prior transplant , patient randomize treatment control arm . The randomization base age group 1-5y , 5-12y 12-18y Treatment arm : Patients receive aminophylline load dose 5mg/kg prior transplant continue receive aminophylline 1.8mg/kg Q6h total 20 dos . Control arm : Patients receive placebo infusion normal saline , pre-transplant , follow normal saline infusion match volume frequency treatment arm total 20doses . The difference two arm study intervention . Other patient receive standard care patient undergo kidney transplant . Theophylline drug level monitor every morning patient first 4 day post- transplant . Theophylline level report independently laboratory faxed research report directly pharmacist perform dose adjustment , accord follow table . Theophylline Level ( mcg/ml ) Dose Adjustment &lt; 2 Increase subsequent dose 50 % 2-2.9 Increase subsequent dose 33 % 3-3.9 Increase subsequent dose 25 % 4-4.9 Increase subsequent dose 15 % 5-7 ( goal ) Target Level ; No dose adjustment 7.1-8.4 Decrease subsequent dose 10 % 8.5-9.9 Decrease subsequent dose 15 % 10-12.4 Decrease subsequent dose 25 % 12.5-14.9 Decrease subsequent dose 50 % 15-19.9 Decrease subsequent dose 67 % &gt; 19.9 Discontinue aminophylline dos . Contact Medical Monitor All involve personnel blind patient 's allocation drug level result . The investigator also collect urine sample NGAL ( Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ) level patient 12 hour post-transplant . Primary outcome calculate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) postoperative day 5 . The investigator determine whether patient aminophylline group improve GFR compare control group . The investigator also determine whether patient receive aminophylline low urinary NGAL level compare control group indicate less degree kidney injury . Urinary NGAL ( Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ) biomarker kidney injury . Elevated urinary NGAL level post-transplant find predictive delay graft function need dialysis post-transplant . At investigator ' center patient undergo routine kidney protocol biopsies 6 month post- transplant . After slide read pathologist investigator use tissue block quantify amount fibrosis use computerized image analysis Sirius Red-stained biopsy . The amount fibrosis see 6 month protocol biopsy proven correlate expected graft survival . An independent medical monitor assigned manage toxic theophylline level &gt; 20mcg/mL . The laboratory report directly medical monitor , discontinue aminophylline remove patient study . The trial also monitor Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) unrelated study . The DSMB meet enrollment 20 patient assess drug safety monitor adverse event drug .</detailed_description>
