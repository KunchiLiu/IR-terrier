Traditional continue medical education limit efficacy , new approach require . Objective : We report design trial ass educational efficacy InsuOnline© , game education primary care physician ( PCPs ) initiation adjustment insulin treatment DM , design : ) educationally adequate ; b ) self-motivating attractive . Methods : A multidisciplinary team , endocrinologist , expert medical education , programmer , assemble design development InsuOnline© , serious game include game element well-defined , evidence-based curriculum topic insulin therapy . The first step study usability playability test , PCPs medical student , play game desktop . After adjusts , perform unblinded randomize controlled trial , PCPs work city Londrina , assess educational validity game . A group 64 PCPs play InsuOnline© web , control group , 64 PCPs , underwent traditional teaching activity ( lecture group discussion ) . Knowledge initiate adjust insulin assess web-based multiple-choice questionnaire , attitude regard diabetes/insulin assess Diabetes Attitude Scale 3 , 3 time point : , immediately , 6 month intervention .

	<brief_title>Educational Efficacy Assessment Serious Game Teach Insulin Therapy Primary Care Physicians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achieving maintain good glycemic control mainstay treatment diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . Unfortunately , 24 % 56 % patient DM within goal A1c &lt; 7 % , country . Worldwide , accord public health trend , diabetic treat primary care physician ( PCPs ) , professional lack knowledge confidence several aspect DM management , specially regard insulin use . This contribute common problem know clinical inertia ( `` failure advance therapy indicate '' ) , underuse insulin , poor glycemic control . Continuing medical education ( CME ) DM insulin often advocated solution optimize knowledge practice PCPs ; however , traditional CME activity ( lecture group discussion ) small short-lasting efficacy . Thus , new educational method urgently require . Objectives : To describe design randomize control trial ass InsuOnline© , PC serious game teach PCPs initiation adjustment insulin treatment DM , educationally effective . Methods Game Design A multidisciplinary team assemble : clinical endocrinologist ( LAD , RZE ) , expert medical education ( PAG , MLSGJ , ICMC ) software developers/game designer ( JBA , RMS ) . The endocrinologist compile list main topic ( `` minimum curriculum '' game ) insulin initiation adjustment , treatment adult DM , context primary health care set . Periodic team meeting schedule design development phase , review step , correct problem , make decision follow stage , iterative process . The group agree game develop way satisfy 2 basic condition : ) educationally adequate ; b ) self-motivating attractive final user . Level Design Sixteen diabetic patient create , reflect common clinical scenario actual primary health care clinical practice , one corresponding least one topic game´s minimum curriculum . Each patient game level . The patients/levels dispose increase complexity order . The player´s avatar must take decision best therapeutic option improve patient´s glycemic control . Right decision lead progression next level . Interaction Ways Game Elements Players´ interaction game make via mouse . Several way interaction game element include along game , make pleasant experience maximize players´ intrinsic motivation . The player read patients´s clinical chart , dialogue ( choose among option `` talk '' ) , see lab test fingertip glucose reading , review physical exam , answer `` quiz challenge '' , solve puzzle , get `` tip '' mentor nurse , , finally , prescribe insulin . Sound track , score , visual sound effect , patient ' `` mood '' ( patient get angry player make many error ) , between-levels animation scene ( `` machinimas '' ) also include , improve game experience players´ motivation . Pedagogical Elements Several pedagogical element include game , aim best educational effect , base principle Adult Learning Problem-Based Learning : motivation , goal-orientation , relevancy-orientation , self-pacing , timely appropriate feedback , reinforcement learning , informal environment , contextualisation , practical ( `` hands-on '' ) approach active participation learner . The game give immediate feedback ( give character `` mentor '' ) , compare player 's decision recommendation clinical guideline . Correct decision lead gain point progression game . At every step , game offer additional learning resource : PDF-format help file ( algorithm , summary , clinical pearl ) , orientation `` mentor '' character , link bibliographic reference . If player fails make right choice , try level . Usability Playability Evaluation The next step usability playability assessment . For , enroll 4 physician work city Londrina ( 2 female 2 male ; 2 gaming/computer previous experience 2 without experience ) 4 undergraduate medical student UEL ( 2 female 2 male , without game experience ) , play game desktop , control environment ( lab usability test ) , participant alone single session . Usability data assess use web-based System Usability Scale ( SUS ) , previously describe Brooke , playability assess web-based Heuristic Evaluation Playability ( HEP ) , describe Desurvire et al . The action player record software analysis researcher ( LAD , RMS ) . Further adjustment make game , accord response obtain phase study . Educational Efficacy Assessment After final adjustment game , guide usability playability assessment , efficacy InsuOnline© educational tool assess unblinded randomized control trial . We send letter invitation primary care physician ( PCPs ) work city Londrina participate study ; PCPs fulfill sample size , also invite PCPs city state Paraná ( Brazil ) , Maringá , Curitiba , São José do Pinhais . The PCPs willing participate study include randomize study entry , use random number generator , one 2 group . We exclude clinical endocrinologist diabetologists . Physicians enrol Group A expose InsuOnline© . They ask play game end , web ( individual login ) , time rhythm . Physicians enrol Group B undertake traditional ( in-class ) learning session , one afternoon , compose short lecture group discussion clinical case identical one include InsuOnline© . This traditional learning session focus teach topic game , coordinate clinical endocrinologist link research team , order avoid potential bias . This endocrinologist previously train researcher endocrinologist , use didactic material prepared team . We evaluate subjects´ knowledge insulin therapy use web-based questionnaire , contain 10 20 multiple-choice question . The question clinical vignette diabetic patient require initiation and/or adjustment insulin ; , participant choose best option achieve good glycemic control , accord current guideline . Questions regard insulin therapy choose American Diabetes Association Self-Assessment Program , Module 2 ( Pharmacological Treatment Hyperglycemia ) , translate Portuguese , adapt compatible game´s clinical scenario learn objective . Participants´ attitude regard diabetes also assess , application web-based Diabetes Attitudes Scale , version 3 ( DAS-3 ) . The questionnaire DAS-3 answer participant 3 time point : intervention ( pre-test ) , immediately intervention ( after-test ) , 6 month intervention ( late-test ) . The average right answer present compare : ) different time point , within group ( intragroup ) , use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) ; b ) two group , time point ( intergroup ) , use Student´s test . A bicaudal significance level 0.05 adopt . Data analysis do intention-to-treat , last observation carry forward , mean randomized participants´ data include final analysis . A Likert-scale free-text question also ask participant end intervention , order ass general impression intervention ( mostly assess pleasant enjoyable ) . Software-recorded data player´s usage game analyze ass : number logins , time spent game , etc . For participant Group A finish game , reason early withdrawal collect online questionnaire . We contact ( phone e-mail ) least twice participant eventually fulfill questionnaire . In order detect minimum difference 0.5 standard deviation average right answer , 80 % statistical power , 5 % significance level , need include 128 subject study ( 64 group ) . We enroll 160 subject ( 80 group ) , order compensate expect 25 % dropout rate . Ethical Considerations Participation anonymous voluntary , subject previously provide write informed consent , accord Brazilian Health Ministry´s regulation ( see inform consent form Appendix ) . The study protocol approve local Research Ethics Committee ( UEL , # 051/2011 # 051/2012 ) , register UEL research board ( Research Project # 07471 ) .</detailed_description>
