	<brief_summary>Very large bile duct stone difficult remove . The prefered method involve endoscopic procedure know endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) perform use special side view endoscope . In past small basket pass scope bile duct use remove stone use mechanical force . Recently small scope know cholangioscope introduce side view endoscope directly bile duct . These cholangioscopes may use guide laser therapy bile duct stone . The investigator suspect stone destruction use cholangioscopy guide laser stone destruction may enable bile duct stone remove quickly safely added mechanical technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TITLE : Randomized trial combination cholangioscopic guide laser lithotripsy conventional mechanical versus conventional mechanical method endoscopic removal large bile duct stone STUDY ARMS : Laser guide lithotripsy conventional method vs conventional method alone alone BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES : Large bile duct stone challenge remove time endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) classically require utilization mechanical basket balloon . These maneuver may associate bile duct trauma , bleeding , pancreatitis , requirement additional procedure . Many patient require multiple session use conventional mechanical approach . A recent prospective audit patient undergo ERCP past year LAC+USC Medical Center indicate approximately 500 procedure 250 bile duct stone 100 ( 40 % ) require multiple procedure stent placement . Scheduling challenge limited resource make difficult many patient return stent change increase risk complication include cholangitis . Cholangioscopy enable therapeutic intervention include intracorporeal electro-hydraulic laser lithotripsy biliary stone disease favorable efficacy safety . Direct visualization cholangioscopy minimize risk laser relate bile duct injury potentially much less traumatic efficacious traditional mechanical approach . A recent 15 center prospective clinical cohort study demonstrate high success rate , 89 % , low rate complication , 7.5 % , single user cholangioscopy system . In group patient underwent stone removal use cholangioscope introduce laser electrohydraulic system success even higer 92 % complication potentially low . Available literature indicate case ERCP mechanical lithotripsy require complication rate approximately 5-12 % risk cholangitis 1.4-4 % . If ERCP perform laser lithotripsy addition conventional mechanical method complication rate 6.1 % risk cholangitis 2.4 % . Cholangioscopy guide laser treatment enhance stone removal currently widely use gastroenterologist academic center include hospital University Southern California well lead community center Kaiser Permanente Hospitals Southern California . While standard care procedure large bile duct stone study directly compare efficacy traditional mechanical approach need . The long term goal project ass whether addition cholangioscopy guide laser lithotripsy facilitate removal large bile duct stone time ERCP . Previous prospective study demonstrate technology safe method feasible . The goal pilot study determine effect size difference laser lithotripsy v currently available method stone removal aim estimate sample size fully power randomize trial . Additional aim assess procedure duration , cost , number additional procedure require stone clearance . Complications , hospitalization relate stent dysfunction ( frequently place lithotripsy session ) , eventual need surgery also outcomes . Healing time time prior return work also outcomes . OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE : This pilot project measure effect cholangioscopy guide laser lithotripsy addition currently available method . Large multicenter prospective study already demonstrate technique safe feasible . The overall aim ass whether laser lithotripsy combine conventional method enhances rate , efficacy , cost stone removal compare conventional method include mechanical lithotripsy . STUDY DESIGN : The study prospective single blind randomized control trial . All patient present choledocholithiasis consider study . If ultrasound , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate large stone ( &gt; 1cm ) biliary dilatation ( &gt; 1cm ) fulfill exclusion criterion consent study . Randomization stratify base whether procedure first repeat ERCP . At point full time study coordinator use computer generate randomization schedule conceal allocation generate 2:1 assignment ( laser versus conventional ) . At time cholangiogram , do immediately prior stone removal , assessment make attend endoscopist confirm stone great 1cm size . If confirm , stone removal attempt use laser lithotripsy use holmium probe introduce use single operator cholangioscopy system versus conventional method . Conventional method include mechanical basket balloon may also use remove debris follow laser lithotripsy laser lithotripsy group . The cholangioscope introduce randomized mechanical lithotripsy conventional method alone employ . Stents place discretion attend endoscopist group . Multiple ERCP procedure may require remove stone . Patients remain assigned treatment group subsequent study . Whether stone successfully remove end course therapy number ERCP require stone clearance outcomes interest . The patient blind whether cholangioscope use . The patient follow clinically principal investigator assist full time study coordinator daily inpatient basis bimonthly phone call outpatient basis 2 month complete clearance stone bile duct confirm . DEVICE INFORMATION : The following device use : Spyglass Direct Visualization System Coherent Holmium Laser VP Spyglass Direct Visualization System make Boston Scientific Coherent Holmium Laser VP produce Convergent Laser Technologies rent Mobile Med . All device use study approve FDA indication . SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS See Inclusion/Exclusion Criterion STRATIFICATION/DESCRIPTIVE FACTORS/RANDOMIZATION SCHEME Patient stratify whether undergone prior ERCP whether procedure question first ERCP . The descriptive factor record patient enrol study include : age , race , gender , comorbidities time presentation . Following stratification whether undergone ERCP , computer generate randomized schedule conceal allocation generate 2:1 assignment patient , place either intervention arm ( laser lithotripsy use holmium probe introduce use single operator cholangioscopy system ) control arm ( conventional method ) . As pilot study , design gauge extent treatment effect power large study 60 patient enrol . ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY Side effects/Toxicities monitor . Patients either group may develop post procedure pain , pancreatitis , cholangitis , bile duct injury , bleed . Adverse Event Reporting : All adverse event report principal investigator . The study physician coordinator meet monthly review . Adverse event report IRB , Data Monitoring Committee , include publication . Data Monitoring Committee : The study physician coordinator meet monthly review adverse event . After 50 patient collect data review monitor board include PI , coinvestigators , study coordinator , two senior physician part clinical gastroentrology faculty CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS Endpoint Definitions The principle endpoint endoscopic clearance ductal stone course therapy . Secondary endpoint assess procedure duration , cost , number procedure require stone clearance . Complications , hospitalization relate stent dysfunction ( frequently place lithotripsy session ) , need bile duct surgery also endpoints . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Descriptive statistic perform patient characteristic pre-treatment clinical measure , comparison group make ensure balanced . Any variable significantly different group include model covariates . Intent treat test primary outcome clearance ductal strons test use Fisher 's exact chi-squared compare rate clearance group . Results test allow estimation sample size fully power clinical trial . This method use test dichotomous secondary outcome : hospitalization related stent dysfunction bile duct surgery . Other secondary aim , include count complication , heal time , time prior return work test use Poission regression . Total cost compare use independent t-tests . Alpha = 0.05 analysis . Additionally , pilot study , effect size compute determine potential clinical relevance outcome . Statistical analysis perform biostatisticians Biostatistical Bioinformatics Resource Group within SC CTSI .</detailed_description>
