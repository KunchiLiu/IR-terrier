	<brief_title>Evaluation Oral Anti-TNF Antibody Patients With Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There significant unmet medical need effective oral pharmacologic therapy inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis . Current anti-TNF therapy , include infliximab adalimumab , effective treatment condition , must administer intravenous subcutaneous injection . The major safety concern associate use injectable anti-TNF therapy infection , demyelinate disease , lymphoma , result systemic exposure . These uncommon serious side effect limit use systemic anti-TNF antibody therapy patient severe disease fail respond first-line treatment . AVX-470 purified immunoglobulin ( Ig ) colostrum ( early milk ) cow immunize recombinant human tumor necrosis factor ( rhTNF ) . AVX-470 formulated delayed-release enteric-coated capsule design protect capsule content gastric acid follow oral administration provide localize delivery sit inflammation distal intestine . Prior clinical experience bovine Ig therapies human disease suggest AVX-470 absorb significant extent , mean systemic exposure could minimize . The development oral anti-TNF therapy target local intestinal disease activity might reduce risk associate injectable anti-TNF therapy allow convenience oral dosing . The present study first-in-human , Phase 1 clinical study . It primarily intend evaluate safety tolerability multiple dose AVX-470 administer orally patient active ulcerative colitis . Animal model ulcerative colitis use mouse-specific TNF antibody derive bovine colostrum demonstrate 50 % reduction tissue TNF , TNF-messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) , interleukin ( IL ) -6 mRNA , myeloperoxidase lower colonic inflammatory activity . Twenty-eight-day toxicology study demonstrate clinical histologic finding exposure intend clinical dose range .</detailed_description>
