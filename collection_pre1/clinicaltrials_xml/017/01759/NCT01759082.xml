	<brief_summary>Based Doppler effect , Laser Doppler Imaging ( LDI ) use interaction light move erythrocyte visualize perfusion microcirculatory system . The new device use study adapt specifically application , facilitate use clinic . It design take standard white light image area inspection simultaneously perfusion image facilitate clinical assessment . Port-wine stain ( PWS ) birthmarks congenital , low-flow vascular malformation skin find approximately 0.3 % child . They commonly find face neck may cause serious psychological consequence . Lasers modality choice treatment PWS birthmark . The use PDL effective PWS closing blood vessel diminish therefore redness skin . Repeated laser treatment necessary achieve desire clinical outcome . Actually , efficacy treatment PWS laser obtain clinical inspection digital photography . By measure activity intensity microcirculation present skin , Laser-Doppler ( LDI ) capable measure effect Pulsed dye laser ( PDL ) treatment port-wine stain .</brief_summary>
