	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare pain level felt patient receive placement peripheral intravenous catheter ( IV line ) follow administration local anesthetic . The local anesthetic test lidocaine , buffer lidocaine , bacteriostatic normal saline . Lidocaine commonly use premedication reduce pain upon insertion peripheral IV line . However , due acidic nature , lidocaine may cause pain upon administration . To help counter discomfort , pharmacies `` buffer '' lidocaine use sodium bicarbonate , increase pH neutral value , result less pain . Bacteriostatic normal saline also use local anesthesia peripheral IV placement , particularly patient lidocaine allergy , contain benzyl alcohol act local anesthetic . There minimal report literature directly compare patient report pain three agent one another , although study exist compare buffered lidocaine versus lidocaine buffer lidocaine versus bacteriostatic normal saline . To address comparison gap , follow research question need ask : anesthetic agent superior premedication reduce amount pain upon administration local anesthetic pain associate peripheral insertion catheter ? The hypothesis investigator significant difference degree pain scale anesthetic agent justify pharmacoeconomic cost associate compound buffer lidocaine . The primary outcome measure study level pain report patient upon administration local anesthetic upon insertion peripheral intravenous catheter . A secondary outcome include pharmacoeconomic analysis look specifically cost-savings use one agent take account daily time allocate pharmacy technician pharmacists compound verify buffered lidocaine .</brief_summary>
