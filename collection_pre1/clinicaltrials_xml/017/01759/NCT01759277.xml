	<brief_summary>Patients typically experience moderate-to-severe pain follow knee arthroplasty usually treat combination oral intravenous analgesic enhance continuous peripheral nerve block . There currently two location place perineural catheter provide analgesia follow knee arthroplasty : femoral nerve catheter adductor canal catheter . Both demonstrated effective follow knee arthroplasty . However , remain unknown one location superior ; , accurately , relative benefit technique . While femoral CPNB many benefit , one challenge use technique decrease quadriceps muscle strength limit factor rehabilitation . In contrast , adductor canal catheter affect vastus medialis . This block may lessen block-induced quadriceps weakness follow knee arthroplasty compare femoral infusion . The investigator hypothesize compare femoral perineural local anesthetic infusion , adductor canal infusion associate short time four discharge criterion meet : ( 1 ) adequate analgesia ; ( 2 ) independence intravenous analgesic ; ( 3 ) ability ambulate 30 ; ( 4 ) ability stand , walk 3 , return sit position without another 's assistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Femoral Versus Adductor Canal Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of importance : The primary investigation involve 80 evaluable subject ( primary endpoint data ) tri-compartment knee arthroplasty . In addition , investigator enroll 70 subject uni-compartment knee arthroplasty pilot study preparation subsequent large , definitive trial . These two group analyze together -- represent two distinct study : one definitive RCT tri-compartment knee arthroplasty ; , one pilot study uni-compartment knee arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
