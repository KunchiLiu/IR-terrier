	<brief_summary>Since hydrogen therapy human seem beneficial treat inflammation , ischemia-reperfusion injury oxidative stress , seem plausible evaluate effect exogenously administer hydrogen element instant management sport-related soft tissue injury ( e.g . muscle sprain , ligament strain , tendonitis , contusion ) . The main aim present study examine effect two-week hydrogen-rich oral topical administration inflammation , recovery functional ability competitive male female athlete acute soft-tissue injury . During season 2012/2013 ( February June ) subject ( 36 professional athlete ) recruit examined certified sport medicine specialist out-patient clinic Center Health , Exercise Sport Sciences first 24 hour sport-related soft tissue injury sustain . The subject allocate double-blind design three randomly assign trial . During period 2 week subject placebo group ( PLA ) receive traditional treatment protocol soft-tissue injury , consist RICE protocol first 48 h sub-acute protocol thereafter . Subjects first experimental group follow procedures additional administration oral hydrogen-rich capsule ( 4 capsule three time per day ) throughout study . Subjects second experimental group follow procedure first experimental group additional administration hydrogen-rick pack 6 time per day 20 minute throughout study . Participants evaluate begin study ( e.g . time injury report ) , 7 14 day baseline testing : ) serum C-reactive protein , plasma viscosity interleukin 6 level , b ) pain intensity rest walking , c ) degree joint swelling , ) passive joint flexibility , , e ) subjective side-effects . The investigator expect administration hydrogen significantly improve inflammation outcome ( e.g . decrease serum C-reactive protein ) compare placebo , topical hydrogen administration additionally improve post-injury recovery outcome ( e.g . pain intensity , degree swell ) . These result could support hypothesis hydrogen-rich intervention may include element immediate treatment sport-related soft tissue injury .</brief_summary>
