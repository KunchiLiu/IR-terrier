	<detailed_description>The cost potential complication ( side effect ) therapy currently use treat Crohn 's disease could potentially reduce non-invasive test exist determined therapy benefit patient . Currently , therapy prescribe , doctor rely solely clinical parameter gauge whether therapy helpful . This include evaluation overall general well-being , abdominal pain , number liquid stool per day . There establish reliable non-invasive test predict whether person respond therapy early course treatment evaluation may inconclusive . During research study look change sugar metabolism low-dose PET/CT 2 week first infusion infliximab therapy . This find change predict clinical response steroid-free remission two , six 12 month , patient Crohn 's disease . PET/CT use detect active inflammation ( reaction part body injury infection ) Crohn 's disease well complications ulcer , fissure , stricture ( thin , break , fix narrow bowel , respectively ) . PET ( positron emission tomography ) scan take picture use special dye `` light '' inside body . This happen special dye contain radiation , similar radiation standard x-ray . CT ( compute tomography ) use x-rays computer make picture . The radioactive tracer use study FDG . FDG radioactive sugar . FDG approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . This tracer show early response chemotherapy cancer treatment variety tumor . Changes FDG uptake accurately predict persistent response little hour day therapy begin . These change often happen week month anatomic change CT MRI . Sometimes CT MRI never change . One FDG PET study look treatment inflammatory condition show FDG uptake decrease significantly within two week start therapy rheumatoid arthritis . Accurate early assessment FDG PET/CT shortly start therapy infliximab potential change standard clinical approach initial continue infliximab therapy patient Crohn 's disease .</detailed_description>
