	<brief_summary>Currently , direct , reliable , bed-side , non-invasive method assess change brain activity associate concussion . Event Related Potentials ( ERPs ) , temporal reflection neural mass electrical activity cell specific region brain occur response stimulus , may offer method , provide noninvasive portable measure brain function . The ERPs provide excellent temporal information , spatial resolution ERPs traditionally limit . However , use high-density electroencephalograph ( EEG ) record spatial resolution ERPs improve significantly . The paradigm current study combine neurophysiological knowledge mathematical signal processing pattern recognition method ( BNA™ ) temporally spatially map brain function , connectivity synchronization . The propose study provide additional evidence utility contribution BNA™ test ( reflect temporal spatial change brain activity well brain functional connectivity associate concussion ) concussion management .</brief_summary>
