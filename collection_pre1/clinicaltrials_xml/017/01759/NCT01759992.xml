	<brief_summary>The global loss muscle mass strength associate age cause functional impairment disability , particularly old elderly ( &gt; 80 year ) . Respiratory function severely compromised decrease respiratory ( RM ) strength complicate presence comorbidities physical immobility . In context , need supportive service involve need long-term care consequently institutionalization . Previous study show increase RM strength positive healthy effect , increase functional capacity , decrease RM fatigue , decrease dyspnoea improvement quality life , healthy people patient . Therefore , specific RM training may regard beneficial alternative improve RM function , thus prevent physical clinical deterioration frail population . Study hypothesis : The inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) would improve respiratory muscle strength endurance , exercise capacity quality life elderly population , unable engage general exercise conditioning .</brief_summary>
