	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct randomized clinical trial compare two type splint treatment Boxer 's fracture child age 17 inclusive . Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize either Group A B . Group A treat conventional plaster ulnar gutter splint . Group B treat custom mold thermoplastic hand-based splint . The thermoplastic splint provide support metacarpal immobilize patient 's wrist interphalangeal joint . Hypothesis : Is plaster splint immobilization equivalent treatment method custom make thermoplastic splint fifth metacarpal neck fracture ? Will one splint tolerate good compliance different two group ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing Conventional Plaster Thermoplastic Splints Treat Pediatric Boxer 's Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly Boxer 's fracture treat without surgery use splint keep part hand move ( immobilization ) . There several acceptable method immobilization use hand surgeon , use splint different sizes material variable period time ( 1-6 ) . A recent systematic review The Cochrane Collaboration find current data inconclusive regard optimal immobilization technique highlight need study ( 2 ) . Specifically , recommend future study include functional outcome measure , time return work , complication , pain score , economic analysis . The current practice investigator ' institution patient splint plaster ulnar gutter splint , Emergency Department refer next available plastic surgery clinic . If need , closed reduction would perform clinic , significant angulation ( great 45 degree ) clinical rotation deformity . The common method immobilization involve place wrist , ring finger little finger way fingertip mid-forearm mold plaster call ulnar gutter splint . The splint leave 24 hour day 3 4 week remove clinic . Many patient find difficult keep splint full 3 4 week number reason . The plaster need stay dry , make awkward bathe . The splint also get loose rub swell around fracture get well . The splint also start smell sweat build . Some patient find plaster material heavy , make difficult wear . Finally , many patient self-conscious appearance splint remove reason alone . In investigator ' experience , 1 5 patient remove splint doctor 's order one reason another . When patient follow instruction keep splint 24 hour day 3 4 week , lead joint stiffness splint remove . Some patient may even require physiotherapy regain normal finger movement grip strength . It unknown ulnar gutter splint really best way immobilize hand Boxer 's fracture . It unknown material best make splint , whether truly necessary keep entirety wrist ring little finger still , long hand finger keep still . Most surgeon recommend patient wear splint 3 4 week . The investigator would like determine small splint make durable , lighter moldable plastic allows earlier movement hand finger still keep fracture move give result commonly use ulnar gutter splint . Functional Hand Based Splint ( Thermoplastic Splint ) The functional hand-based splint make custom mold hard plastic fit hand . A thermoplastic splint make plastic heated custom-fitted subject 's hand , harden cool . This thermoplastic splint custom fit occupational therapist joint free move . The splint limit patient move wrist finger wear . It custom mold fit snuggly patient 's hand hold fracture stable position . Several adult study find type custom mold splint superior either surgical treatment and/or plaster splint immobilization result less stiffness , good movement splint removal , increase pain ( 4-7 ) . The investigator aware comparative study do pediatric patient . Compliance Patient compliance wear splint prescribe problem . At investigator ' institution , non-compliance rate approximately 15 20 % Boxer 's fracture patient . The investigator hypothesize hand-based splint well tolerate patient therefore result high rate compliance prescribe duration plaster splint . Also , thermoplastic splint damage get wet , may translate few additional visit clinic emergency department splint replace . This study randomize , single-blinded control trial . The randomization two splint type determine computer-based number generator . The patient know type splint , plastic surgeon physiotherapist examine test subject ROM grip strength know type splint subject . Patients randomize one two group first clinic visit , within 7 day injury . They splint place visit wear splint time 3 week . Subjects return clinic 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 week reassess . Specified outcome measure ( primary secondary ) test visit .</detailed_description>
