	<brief_summary>Carotid endarterectomy commonly perform cervical plexus block . This presumed offer advantage general anesthesia term monitor neurological function cross-clamping carotid artery since , conscious patient , speech , cerebration , motor power provide early measure inadequate cerebral perfusion . Some study also claim low shunting requirement , low cardiovascular morbidity , short hospital stay . Traditionally , common method cervical plexus block term 'deep ' 'superficial ' . The deep block , describe Moore Winnie colleague , consist identify transverse process upper cervical vertebra C2 - C4 inject local anesthetic directly deep ( prevertebral ) cervical space . This may achieve either separate injection single injection . The superficial block incorporates variety procedure . The simple s.c. infiltration local anesthetic along posterior border sternocleidomastoid muscle either surgeon anesthetist . An 'intermediate ' block one injecting needle pierce invest fascia neck , deep s.c. layer , superficial deep cervical ( prevertebral ) fascia . It also possible use 'combined block ' , consist deep injection superficial intermediate injection . Practitioners may prefer one block another , consensus exist efficacy one block compare another . However , suggest complication technique relate deep injection superficial ( intermediate ) injection . These complication include intrathecal intravascular injection , respiratory problem relate phrenic nerve paralysis , local anaesthetic toxicity . In study Influence concentration local anesthetic ropivacaine quality intermediate cervical plexus block carotid endarterectomy evaluate . For purpose two different concentration ropivacaine compare ( 3,75 % vs 7,5 % ) . The primary endpoint study quantity additional need local anesthetic achieve adequate operative analgesia . Furthermore record frequency common side effect well patient satisfaction standardize questionnaire .</brief_summary>
