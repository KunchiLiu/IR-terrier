	<brief_summary>Vitamin D promote differentiation prostate cancer cell maintain differentiated phenotype prostate epithelial cell . The result investigator ' clinical study indicate vitamin D3 supplementation result decrease positive cancer core repeat biopsy subject low-risk prostate cancer . The investigator hypothesize Veterans early-stage prostate cancer take vitamin D3 4000 international unit per day ( intervention group ) show improvement number positive core Gleason score repeat biopsy , decrease likelihood undergo definitive treatment ( prostatectomy radiation therapy ) , compare Veteran subject take placebo ( control group ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D3 Supplementation Low-Risk Prostate Cancer : A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The central hypothesis grant application vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) supplementation benefit Veteran subject diagnose early-stage , low-risk prostate cancer , elect disease monitor active surveillance . Specifically , investigator hypothesize Veterans take vitamin D3 daily dose 4000 international unit ( IU ) minimum one year ( intervention group ) show improvement number positive core Gleason score repeat biopsy , decrease likelihood undergoing additional treatment ( hormone therapy , prostatectomy radiation therapy ) , compare Veterans take placebo ( control group ) . To test hypothesis , investigator propose follow Specific Aims : 1 . To determine whether vitamin D3 ( 4,000 IU per day FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR ) result significant improvement pathology status repeat biopsy Veteran subject take vitamin D3 , compare Veteran subject take placebo . This hypothesis test randomized clinical trial , enroll 136 Veteran subject ( 68 participant per arm ) , diagnose early-stage prostate cancer ( Gleason score 6 , PSA 10 , clinical stage T1C T2a ) . The pathology status measure change Gleason score number positive core prostate needle biopsy specimen baseline end study . Pre- post-study biopsy perform part standard medical care diagnosis active surveillance . 2 . To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation , compare placebo , result significant decrease number Veteran subject undergo additional treatment ( hormone therapy , prostatectomy radiation therapy ) , follow outcome repeat biopsy . 3 . To analyze change serum level cholecalciferol , 25 ( OH ) D , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) baseline end study , estimate association change measure pathology outcome ( Gleason score number positive core ) . 4 . To compare expression molecular biomarkers , prognostically relevant prostate cancer progression , pre- post- treatment biopsy tissue specimen . Paraffin-embedded section process assess immunohistochemical technique expression follow biomarkers : Vitamin D Receptor ( VDR ) , P21 , Tumor Growth Factor ( TGF ) , Cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) , NF B . All protein product impact growth control chronic inflammation prostate cancer progression specifically affect Vitamin D status . Implementation propose study would demonstrate Vitamin D3 supplementation provide welcome addition active surveillance , since patient respond Vitamin D3 supplementation ( indicated decrease score number positive core repeat biopsy ) safely continue active surveillance would need definitive treatment . In turn , would result decreased likelihood overtreatment . On hand , subject progress Vitamin D3 supplementation , indicated increase Gleason score number positive core repeat biopsy , may aggressive disease may need consider definitive treatment . Therefore , group patient ( responder well non-responders ) would benefit Vitamin D3 supplementation , intervention strategy extremely cost-effective easy implement .</detailed_description>
