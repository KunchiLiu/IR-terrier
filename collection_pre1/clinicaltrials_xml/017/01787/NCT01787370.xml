	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lifelong process result interaction many risk factor , environmental influence , genetic predisposition . Although collection medical history standard risk factor provide essential information , existence complex interaction among different risk factor , risk modification medical therapy , inter-individual difference complicate issue . In light limitation , alternative approach seek , non-invasive assessment endothelial function propose possible non-invasive inexpensive endpoint could reflect cumulative cardiovascular burden and/or responsiveness therapy level individual patient . A total 1000 consecutive patient undergo elective coronary angiography study . Patients chest pain effort accord American College Cardiology/American Heart Association 2007 Guidelines and/or pathological exercise dobutamine stress test . Patients undergoing catheterization reason stable ( suspect ) CAD ( e.g . hypertensive crisis associate troponin elevation , acute coronary syndrome , valvular heart disease , congenital heart disease , cardiomyopathy , etc . ) exclude . Patients know chronic inflammatory disease , dialysis , decompensated/severe heart failure also exclude . Blood sample draw patient fast period least 12 h examine use routine laboratory method blood count , lipid parameter , C-reactive protein , renal hepatic function . Coronary risk factor define : obesity ( body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) ; age ; smoking ( previous smoking ) ; hyperlipidaemia ( total serum cholesterol &gt; 220 mg/dL and/or serum triglyceride &gt; 200 mg/dL ) ; hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg two consecutive seat measurement therapy antihypertensive medication ) ; family history ( first-degree relative cardiovascular disease ) ; diabetes mellitus ( fast serum glucose level &gt; 126 mg/dL therapy oral hypoglycaemic agent insulin ) . The method employ L-FMC/FMD ( flow mediate dilation ) 'analysis laboratory previously publish ( Gori Journal American College Cardiology 2008 ) . Briefly , patient place supine , leave arm immobilize , L-FMC FMD measure use Vivid 7 ( General Electrics , Munich , Germany ) ultrasound platform equip 14 MHz matrix probe micrometric probe holder . Low-flow-mediated constriction corresponds constriction observe 4.5 min occlusion pneumatic cuff place distal site arterial diameter measurement . Flow-mediated dilation corresponds maximal dilation observe 5 min follow deflation cuff , i.e . reactive hyperaemia . Repeatability reproducibility data method recently report ( intra-class correlation coefficient=0.68 0.80 FMD L-FMC , respectively ) . All data acquire digitally analyse randomize , blind fashion prior coronary angiography investigator aware clinical status patient , use automatic dedicate software .</detailed_description>
