	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Improving Survival Patients With Newly Diagnosed Cancer With Vitamin D Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine vitamin D replacement vitamin D insufficient patient newly diagnose untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) improve event free survival 12 month equivalent control population vitamin D sufficient patient . ( Study I ) II . To assess percentage patient require treatment conventional therapy 36 month vitamin D insufficient patient early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) manage observation undergo vitamin D replacement . ( Study II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect vitamin D replacement vitamin D insufficient patient newly diagnose untreated DLBCL overall survival . ( Study I ) II . To assess effect vitamin D replacement vitamin D insufficient patient newly diagnose untreated DLBCL event free survival . ( Study I ) III . To assess effect vitamin D replacement vitamin D insufficient patient newly diagnose untreated T cell lymphoma event free overall survival . ( Study I ) IV . To assess effect vitamin D replacement vitamin D insufficient CLL patient Bio-r response rate overall response rate . ( Study II ) V. To assess time treatment overall survival vitamin D insufficient CLL patient receive vitamin D replacement . ( Study II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study immune effector cell ( lymphocyte , monocyte ) , serum cytokine , tumor cell vitamin D deficient sufficient patient learn effect vitamin D tumor cell patient 's immune system . ( Study I-II ) OUTLINE : Vitamin D sufficient patient receive intervention . Vitamin D insufficient patient receive cholecalciferol orally ( PO ) weekly 12 week monthly total 36 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
