	<brief_summary>This randomize , placebo-controlled , single-center clinical trial investigate effectiveness administrate intravenous Cerebrolysin™ ( EVER NEURO Pharma , Austria ) , preparation low-molecular weight neurotrophic peptide free amino acid , improve functional outcome patient suffer aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) . Cerebrolysin™ porcine-derived intravenous formulation compose multiple lipid-soluble active agent cross blood-brain barrier . It register medication several country indicate stroke Alzheimer 's disease . It contain several low molecular weight neuropeptides free amino acid possess neuroprotective neurotrophic property . It proven arrest mitigate several crucial step along ischemic cascade preclinical study . Cerebrolysin™ extensively investigate patient suffer Alzheimer 's disease , brain trauma ischemic stroke promise clinical result . It 's use SAH patient never investigate believe may play role improve clinical outcome . Consecutive patient age 18 70 years-old diagnose spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary rupture intracranial aneurysm randomly allocate one two study arm : ( 1 ) receive intravenous Cerebrolysin™ additional standard care ( intervention group ) ( 2 ) receive usual standard care alone ( control group ) . Permuted-block randomization carry eligibility criterion fulfil use computer system allocation list random order . Instructions study arm allocation contain sealed envelope label sequential study number . Patients present beyond 96 hour onset symptom recruitment randomization perform within time period exclude . The reason post-SAH arterial vasospasm delay cerebral ischemia usually occur four day aneurysm rupture last two week i.e . 14 day . Should complication arise Cerebrolysin™ administer would significant confound trial outcome measure . The timing intervention keep several landmark clinical study deal neuroprotective agent subarachnoid hemorrhage . Patients intervention group receive daily total dose 30ml intravenous Cerebrolysin™ . The study medication administer three separate 10ml dos ( every eight hour ) dilute 0.9 % NaCl saline total volume 100 ml intravenous infusion time period 15 minute . An identical amount 0.9 % sodium chloride ( NaCl ) saline ( 100 ml ) use placebo patient allocate control study group . The total duration study medication placebo administration 14 day . Cerebrolysin™ clear yellow solution . Since susceptible photo-degeneration preparation dilution 0.9 % NaCl saline require mask opaque plastic wrap well special photo-protective infusion set . The dilution Cerebrolysin™ solution perform ward nursing staff . Subjects trial group receive identically wrap preparation functional outcome assessor patient blind study arm allocation . In addition general demographic data , clinical data include admission Glasgow Coma Score , severity grade SAH , hospital stay well extend Glasgow Outcome Score modify Rankin Score upon discharge , three month six month prospectively collect . The functional outcome assessor occupational therapist unaware subject 's trial group allocation . Hypothesis : compare patient receive standard care management aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage alone ( control ) , additional administration intravenous Cerebrolysin™ ( intervention ) within acute phase stroke safe improves functional outcome six month stroke .</brief_summary>

Any clinical grade subarachnoid hemorrhage provide reasonable prospect survival . 3 . Initiation trial medication within 96 hour time present symptom . 4 . Ethnic Chinese 5 . Age 1870 yearsold 6 . Reasonable expectation completion outcome measure followup 7 . Written inform consent 1 . Unsalvageable patient : fix dilate pupil resuscitation sign brainstem herniation precludes definitive therapy . 2 . No previous history Cerebrolysin™ exposure . 3 . No known allergy Cerebrolysin™ porcine tissuederived product . 4 . Pregnancy breast feed . 5 . Evidence preexist major health problem 6 . Suspected known additional disease process threaten life expectancy , example malignancy . 7 . Known strong suspicion drug dependency include alcohol 8 . Known epilepsy 9 . Any neurological nonneurological condition independent SAH might influence functional outcome efficacy outcome measure</criteria>
