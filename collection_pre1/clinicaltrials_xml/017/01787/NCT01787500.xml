	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose vemurafenib give combination cetuximab irinotecan patient advance cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Vemurafenib design block BRAFV600 inside cancer cell , involved cancer cell growth . Cetuximab design block protein inside cancer cell , may prevent slow growth cancer cell lead cell death . Irinotecan design stop cancer cell make new DNA ( genetic material cell ) . If cancer cell make DNA , divide new cell may die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vemurafenib , Cetuximab , Irinotecan Advanced Solid Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , doctor decide dose level vemurafenib receive . All participant receive standard dose cetuximab irinotecan . Dose Escalation Group : Up 3 dose level vemurafenib test combination cetuximab irinotecan . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The dose study drug combination receive may lower intolerable side effect . Dose Expansion Group : After high tolerable dose vemurafenib find , additional participant enrolled expansion group receive study drug combination dose . This group 15 participant BRAF mutant , KRAS wild type colorectal cancer . Study Drug Administration : You take vemurafenib mouth 2 time day . If doctor think need , may take less often . Vemurafenib take without food . Always take food always take empty stomach . Take full glass water . You receive cetuximab irinotecan vein 90 minute Day 1 cycle . You monitor least 1 hour end drug infusion . Study Visits : During Week 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam skin check . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - You ask drug may take side effect may . At Week 1 Cycles 1-2 , certain group study , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn dose irinotecan 8 time next 24 hour pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . If enrol colorectal cancer dose expansion group , biopsy biomarker test Day 14 Cycle 2 . Beginning Week 1 Cycle 3 , EKG every cycle ( monthly ) 3 month , every 3 month end study . Beginning Week 1 Cycle 3 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker test every cycle ( monthly ) . Beginning Week 1 Cycle 3 , woman able become pregnant blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test every cycle . At Week 1 Cycle 3 Cycle 5 , urine collect routine test . At Week 1 Cycle 3 , certain group study , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PD testing . Every 3 Cycles , image check status disease . These test include follow : CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or bone scan . You also chest x-ray . You additional head neck exam every 12 week study . All patient chest CT 6 month last dose vemurafenib . SCC patient additional chest CTs screen every 6 month study . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You take study early disease get bad , continue intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . °Your skin check . You also head neck exam . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw measure tumor marker . - If certain group study , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test . - You image check status disease . These test include follow : chest x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or bone scan . This investigational study . Vemurafenib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type melanoma patient BRAF mutation . Cetuximab FDA approve commercially available treatment KRAS wild type , EGFR express metastatic colorectal cancer squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Irinotecan FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . The use drug together advance cancer investigational . Up 33 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
