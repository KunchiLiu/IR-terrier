	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Itraconazole Biochemical Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single arm study itraconazole dose 300 mg PO BID patient noncastrate , non-metastatic , biochemically relapsed prostate cancer prior definitive local therapy . Simon 's two stage minimax design follow accrual include interim test lack efficacy . There pre-specified stopping rule safety 10 patient treat minimum 8 week protocol therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic confirmation adenocarcinoma prostate 2 . Biochemically relapsed disease rise PSA least two consecutive measurement least two week apart prior definitive local therapy ( radical prostatectomy , external beam radiation , brachytherapy ) combination radical prostatectomy radiotherapy ( RT ) curative intent 3 . Prior primary salvage radiation candidate salvage radiation due patient preference clinical assessment base upon disease characteristic and/or patient comorbidities . 4 . Minimum PSA : If prior androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) biochemical relapse : 1.0 ng/mL prior radical prostatectomy without adjuvant/salvage radiation therapy , confirm repeat measurement least 2 week later , Nadir + 2 ng/mL prior RT alone without prior radical prostatectomy , confirm repeat measurement least 2 week later If prior ADT biochemical relapse : 4.0 ng/mL &gt; 2 ng/mL nadir prior cycle ADT , whichever high , confirm repeat measurement least 2 week later 5 . No evidence metastatic disease image whole body bone scan ( technetium99 NaF PET bone scan ) crosssectional image abdomen/pelvis ( CT MRI ) within 6 week Day 1 protocol therapy 6 . Prior androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) LHRH agonist and/or antagonist allow either ( neo ) adjuvant treatment local therapy biochemical relapse 7 . Last effective dose LHRH agonist/antagonist `` expire '' &gt; 3 month prior study entry . 8 . For example , patient receive LHRH agonist injection every 3 month would eligible provide last injection &gt; 6 month prior Day 1 protocol therapy . A patient receive LHRH agonist injection every 4 month eligible provide last injection &gt; 7 month prior Day 1 protocol therapy . 9 . Serum testosterone level : If prior androgen deprivation therapy : A single measurement great 150 ng/dL within 3 month day 1 protocol therapy If prior androgen deprivation therapy ( either adjuvant biochemical relapse set ) : The two recent measurement serum testosterone prior Day 1 protocol therapy must fulfill follow criterion : Both measurement great 150 ng/dL . The two measurement space least 14 day apart . Both must measure within 3 month Day 1 protocol therapy . There must increase &gt; 50 ng/dL two successive measurement . 10 . PSA double time ( PSADT ) ≤ 15 month , calculate base upon serum PSA measurement obtain within 3 month prior Day 1 protocol therapy , minimum three PSA measurement space least 14 day apart ( see section 6 ) . PSA value obtain serum testosterone know less 150 ng/dL , prior local therapy , within three month last dose LHRH agonist/antagonist antiandrogen exclude calculation PSADT . PSADT calculation carry use follow website : http : //nomograms.mskcc.org/Prostate/PsaDoublingTime.aspx 11 . Total bilirubin le 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , less 3 time ULN study entry patient document Gilbert‟s disease . 12 . ALT AST level less 1.5 time ULN study entry 13 . Serum potassium great 3.5 mmol/L without oral supplementation 14 . No history uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive medication ) 15 . ECOG performance status 0 1 16 . Estimated life expectancy great 5 year 17 . Age great equal 18 year time study entry 18 . Ability sign write informed consent 19 . Ability swallow study drug whole capsule 20 . Primary prostate cancer tissue available analysis require inclusion onto study strongly encourage . 1 . Castrateresistant disease , evidence either : Rising PSA 2 consecutive measurement least 2 week apart concurrent document serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL time PSA measurement , Rising PSA 2 consecutive measurement least 2 week apart measure within 3 month last LHRH agonist/antagonist injection 2 . Prior bilateral orchiectomy 3 . Congestive heart failure NYHA class III high severity study entry 4 . History chronic active hepatitis 5 . Grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy time study entry 6 . Use 5alpha reductase antagonist ( i.e . finasteride , dutasteride ) antiandrogen ( i.e . flutamide , bicalutamide ) within 6 week Day 1 protocol therapy 7 . Use systemic steroid equivalent dose prednisone 5 mg/day high within 6 week Day 1 protocol therapy 8 . Use medication herbal supplement know potentially low serum PSA within 6 week Day 1 protocol therapy 9 . Use medication may potentially interact itraconazole within 1 week study entry 10 . Use investigational agent within 6 week Day 1 protocol therapy 11 . Prior pathology consistent small cell carcinoma prostate cancer predominantly neuroendocrine differentiation</criteria>
