	<brief_summary>The purpose research ( `` knowledge gap '' research design fill ) understand science combination therapy 2 drug ( inhaled longacting beta-agonists ( LABA ) inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , commonly use chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient , good drug alone . ICS LABA antiinflammatory properties; , dampen inflammation cell airways lung . The combination LABA ICS also show improve clinical effectiveness asthma patient . The addition LABA LOW dose ICS show clinically beneficial asthma use HIGH dose ICS alone . This allow reduction total ICS dose minimise adverse side effect inhaled corticosteroid . Recent evidence suggest use combination therapy LABA ICS may also improve clinical effectiveness COPD patient . Investigators address hypothesis examine inflammation cell COPD direct site disease ( airway ) look sputum/mucus . This research build exist knowledge science drug work asthma COPD allow u understand molecular science , may support new future drug target patient COPD , greatly need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Symbicort ® GR Sputum COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids exert effect bind cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) . The inactive GR bound protein complex include heat shock protein hsp90 , act molecular chaperone prevent nuclear localisation unoccupied GR . GR bind palindromic promotor induces transcriptional induction anti-inflammatory gene mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 ( MKP-1 ) secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor ( SLPI ) . GR-steroid complex also bind negative GRE sequence , result inhibition pro-inflammatory mediator , IL-6 . More importantly , GR bind transcription factor recruitment histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibit wide range pro-inflammatory cytokine . By process transrepression , corticosteroid reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) asthmatic patient whereas far less effective chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient . The combination inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) long act beta 2-agonists ( LABAs ) show improve clinical effectiveness anti-inflammatory property asthma . The addition LABA low dose ICS show clinically beneficial asthma use high dose ICS , allow reduction ICS dose minimise adverse side effect corticosteroid . Recent evidence suggest may also case COPD . ICS budesonide , beclomethasone fluticasone use combination LABA 's formoterol salmeterol . These combination treatment establish national guideline treat patient asthma also , COPD . The combination formoterol budesonide ( Symbicort ® , Astra Zeneca ) study project . Evidence suggest LABAs enhance GR function vitro . In asthmatic study , combination formoterol budesonide ( Symbicort ® , Astra Zeneca ) effective high dose ICS GR activation , gene transactivation transrepression . However , precise mechanism enhance effectiveness unknown , although prim steroid receptor ( GR ) LABAs may important . Investigators develop novel method measure GR-GRE binding activity sputum use enzyme immunosorbent assay system . This method , together measurement functional readout , help u understand mechanism steroid GR interaction use non-invasive method assessment airways . This may provide insight mechanism corticosteroid action whether addition LABA ICS alter molecular pattern , may explain observed beneficial action combination therapy see patient study vivo . This may allow scientific basis explore future drug interaction may helpful patient , particularly patient whose disease tend severe may unresponsive standard therapy COPD and/or high dose ICS little beneficial clinical effect lead side-effects .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients ( n=35 ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) mildtomoderate disease severity ( GOLD 1 2 guideline ) . The postbronchodilator FEV1 use criterion define GOLD severity ( reference 7/Table 1 ) . 2 . Aged 3880 year inclusive 3 . FEV1 &lt; 15 % reversibility ( % predict ) and/or increase &lt; 200 ml inhale β2agonists ( 400 μg salbutamol ) 4 . Patients allow use current shortacting β2agonists ( SABA ) longacting β2agonists ( LABA ) shortacting muscarinicantagonist ( SAMA ) longacting muscarinicantagonists ( LAMA ) . However refrain shortacting β2agonists ( SABA ) shortacting muscarinicantagonist ( SAMA ) 6 hour study visit longacting β2agonists ( LABA ) longacting muscarinicantagonists ( LAMA ) least 12 hour study visit , unless need patient 's clinical condition . 5 . Theophylline ( oral tablet bronchodilator ) require stop least 3 day prior start Study Visit one , patient allow treatment study may affect GR response bronchodilator ( lung function , spirometry ) responses . 6 . Capable give informed consent . 1 . As result medical interview , physical examination screen investigation , Physician Responsible considers volunteer unfit study . 2 . Patients clinical diagnosis Asthma , decide Study Investigators , fulfil diagnosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . 3 . Patients history upper low respiratory infection ( include sinusitis ) within 4 week prior study entry , affect breathe response . 4 . Patients receive oral parenteral steroid within 4 week prior study entry , affect breathe response signifies condition need control well . 5 . Patients hospitalise COPD exacerbation within 1 month study entry and/or receive antibiotic within 4 week study entry , signifies condition need control well . 6 . Patients take regular medication contraindicate ( indicated British National Formulary ) receive study medication list protocol ; oral contraceptive pill . 7 . Any evidence positive pregnancy urine test female volunteer females pregnant lactate likely become pregnant trial . Women child−bearing potential may include study , opinion investigator , take adequate contraceptive precaution ( directly enquire screen visit ) . 8 . Patients history drug allergy , opinion Unit Physician , contraindicate his/her participation study . 9 . Patients know suspected allergy corticosteroid component formulation and/or suspect hypersensitivity inhale corticosteroid ( ask directly screen visit ) . 10 . Patients regularly , average , drink 21 unit alcohol ( male ) 14 unit alcohol ( female ) per week ( ask directly screen visit ) .</criteria>
