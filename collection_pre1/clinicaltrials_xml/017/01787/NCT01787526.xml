	<brief_summary>2-3 % population participate blood donation programme . Traditionally , safety issue transfusion medicine concentrate product recipient safety . Extensive effort include strict donor inclusion criterion test important transmissible infection substantially improve product quality . One common risk blood donation iatrogenic iron deficiency . It may affect 30 % regular blood donor whole blood donation cause loss 200 250 mg iron . Although know least 50 year , iron deficiency routinely assess treated population . Contributing factor include donation frequency , low weight female gender . Women low iron reserve premenopausal woman , daily require amount iron high men . Besides anemia , iron deficiency may lead fatigue impaired cognitive physical performance . Oral iron substitution often associate significant gastrointestinal side effect lead poor compliance . Today , intravenous ( iv . ) iron preparation well tolerate allow application large dose 1000mg one visit . Our hypothesis blood donor iron deficiency intravenous iron feasible preferable oral iron high efficacy optimal compliance similar safety profile extensively study population blood donor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency possibly prevalent worldwide nutritive deficiency estimate &gt; 500 million people adverse effect result . Total body iron amount 3 4.5 gram , large part bound hemoglobin red cell . One common risk blood donation iatrogenic iron deficiency may affect 30 % regular blood donor . Each whole blood donation mean whole blood loss 450 ml ±10 % bag additional sample require test , correspond loss 200 300 mg iron . It estimate 10 apheresis donation equal 1 whole blood donation . Contributing factor include donation frequency , low body weight female gender . In Austria , maximal annual donation frequency 50x plasmapheresis , 26x plateletpheresis 4 ( woman ) respectively 6x ( men ) whole blood donation . Although frequent donation-induced development iron depletion recognize least 50 year , iron deficiency routinely assess treated population . Recently report presence pica , bizarre consumption nonnutritive substance ice cube , associate high probability iron depletion blood donor . Contributing factor poor iron status blood donor include donation frequency , low weight female gender . Women also low iron reserve premenopausal woman , daily require amount iron high men . Besides anemia , iron deficiency may lead fatigue impaired cognitive physical performance . Several trial evaluate different regimen iron substitution blood donor demonstrate good treatment compliance efficacy improve iron status . Oral iron substitution often associate significant gastrointestinal side effect lead poor compliance . Today , high-dose intravenous ( iv . ) iron preparation available , well tolerate allow application large dose 1000mg one visit .</detailed_description>
