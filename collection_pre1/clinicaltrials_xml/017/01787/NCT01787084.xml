	<brief_title>Alternative Access Approaches Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replace ( TAVR ) Inoperable Patients With Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) use Edwards SAPIEN valve Retroflex 3 delivery system provide mortality quality life benefit inoperable patient . Only transfemoral ( TF ) access approve US . A substantial number patient TF approach due inadequate vessel size , vessel disease , anatomical consideration . The pivotal study include assessment safety effectiveness alternative access approach inoperable patient group . Early approach TAVR include femoral transvenous approach transseptal access leave side delivery valve . This approach avoid large bore arterial catheterization , unacceptable rate complication lack reproducibility . Alternative access approach develop risk associate insert large caliber catheter small , diseased femoral artery often associate diffuse vasculopathy . To avoid vascular complication femoral access , transcatheter approach develop include open surgical access leave ventricular apex ( TA ) , ascend aorta , ( TAO ) , subclavian axillary artery ( TS ) , retroperitoneal access iliac artery ( TI ) well distal aorta . In addition provide TAVR patient TF access , additional advantage include good catheter control safer closure access site . Commonly cite disadvantage include need surgical expertise additional equipment , along potential long recovery , incisional pain , great radiation exposure operator , unsuitable delivery catheter alternative access site , host unique alternative access site complication . We propose collectively analyze 30-day safety endpoint lump data group alternative access approach . These data gather clinical practice real-world setting submit TVT Registry . It expect center choose among various choice alternative access base causative factor underlie need alternative access , well local skill set experience . For lumped data group alternative access approach compare 30-day safety result TA outcomes report Cohort A PARTNERS 1 trial . We recognize TA patient high risk operable patient rather inoperable patient , direct comparator group available . We reason TA data publish clinical trial high quality , represent alternative access approach rather TF , provide frequency safety endpoint find acceptable clinically regulatory perspective .</detailed_description>
