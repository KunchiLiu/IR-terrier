	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination ruxolitinib azacytidine help control myelofibrosis myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm . Ruxolitinib design block pathway find overactive human cancer myelofibrosis . Azacytidine design block certain protein cancer cell stop function tumor-fighting protein . By block `` bad '' protein , tumor-fighting gene may able work well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Ruxolitinib And Azacytidine Combination Therapy For Patients With Myelofibrosis And Myelodysplastic Syndrome/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment : A . For patient myelofibrosis myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm : If find eligible take part study , take ruxolitinib 2 time every day mouth . If miss vomit dose ruxolitinib , make dose . Beginning Cycle 4 , Days 1-5 ( +/-6 day ) , receive azacytidine either skin needle vein . Your dose ruxolitinib and/or azacytidine may raise , lower , and/or delay doctor think best interest . You give drug diary ask write time take study drug . Bring unused study drug bottle study visit first 15 cycle treatment . Each cycle 28 day . Study Visits : Each study visit may perform +/- 7 day day state . On Day 1 Cycles 1-7 , 9,12 every 3 cycle ( +/- 1 Month ) start cycle 15 patient arm ( include myelofibrosis myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative evaluate follow : - You ask side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your complete medical history record . - Your transfusion history collect . - Your spleen liver measure . - You complete 2 questionnaire feel . After 2 year protocol treatment , schedule may adjust every 3 6 cycle . Patients myelofibrosis myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm blood draw week Cycles 1 6 1 time month . Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . After Cycles 6 12 , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . Routine blood draw bone marrow biopsy may do less often doctor think best interest . Research Blood Tests : Extra blood drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test pharmacodynamic ( PD ) . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . PD test measure level study drug body may affect disease . Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) drawn PK testing : - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive study drug , 1 , 2 , 5 hour later - On Day 1 Cycle 6 , receive study drug , 1 , 2 , 5 hour later - On Day 1 Cycle 12 ( end study go study early ) , receive study drug , 1 , 2 , 5 hour later Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) drawn PD testing : - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive study drug 2 hour later - On Day 1 Cycle 3 , receive study drug - On Day 1 Cycle 6 , receive study drug 2 hour later - On Day 1 Cycle 9 , receive study drug - On Day 1 Cycle 12 ( end study go study early ) , receive study drug 2 hour later Length Study : You take 15 cycle ruxolitinib 12 cycle azacytidine . After 15 cycle ruxolitinib , doctor think best interest , may change commercial supply continue take 5 year study entry . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You call 30 day go study ask side effect and/or new treatment ( ) . You call ask side effect disease 5 year first start study . If take ruxolitinib longer 16 cycle , need turn study diary every cycle . This investigational study . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treat myelofibrosis . Azacytidine FDA approve commercially available myelodysplastic syndrome . The combination ruxolitinib azacytidine treat myelofibrosis myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm investigational . Up to125 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
