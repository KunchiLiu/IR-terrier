	<brief_summary>Weight loss commonly occur patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( COPD ) , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Loss muscle protein generally central component weight loss CHF COPD patient patient also reduction fat mass bone density , independent severity disease state . The purpose cross-sectional study provide detail insight disease relate gut function obtain information gut permeability , digestion absorption glucose , fat protein CHF COPD patient compare match healthy control . This provide require information necessary implement new strategy develop optimal nutritional regimen CHF COPD . The hypothesis CHF COPD relate decreased gut function absorption , lead decrease anabolic response . Second , decrease nutritional status link reduced muscle function possibly decrease cognition . In addition , examine effect age compare gut function digestion absorption CHF COPD age match healthy control group young healthy subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve one test day approximately 7-8 hour . On test day subject ingest sugar drink ass gut permeability gut function , protein meal measure digestion/absorption anabolic response food intake . Subjects also receive mixture amino acid make little heavy normal , call stable isotope . This stable isotope use investigate protein behavior body ( protein kinetics ) . Blood ( 100-120 ml total ) urine sample collect 7 hour .</detailed_description>
