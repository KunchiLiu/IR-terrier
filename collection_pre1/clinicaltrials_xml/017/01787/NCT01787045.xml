	<brief_summary>It clearly show patient Intensive care Unit ( ICU ) severe sepsis multi organic failure susceptible develop neuromuscular complication . That attribute hyper catabolic state , general inflammation immobilization . This lead significant muscle wasting , polyneuropathy and/or myopathy . These alteration define term Intensive Care Acquired Weakness ( ICUAW ) lead important functional squeal impair quality life month , year case irreversibly . To overcome complication , early activation physiotherapy become important tool . This type treatment show feasible , safe improve functional capacity patient . In addition reduction duration ICU hospital stay improve quality life patient . The objective study demonstrate early active physical activity patient severe sepsis limit loss muscle mass complication relate type damage . Procedures : Patients relatives asked participate study . If positive response do , patient randomize intervention control group . A baseline evaluation perform first day study admission . That include physical exploration , electrophysiological study , skeletal muscle histological/biochemical evaluation monitor blood biomarkers others clinical outcome register . Intervention divide morning afternoon time , patient position chair bed mobilize physiotherapist . As usual , patient attain manual mobilization 20 minute twice day . Only intervention group , additional cycle-ergometer exercise perform 30 minute well performance achieve tolerated patient . All vitals parameter strictly control , intervention . The baseline evaluation repeat day 7 clinical outcome register ICU discharge .</brief_summary>
