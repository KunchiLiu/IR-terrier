	<brief_summary>Stroke represent third commonest cause death heart disease type cancer combine , lead cause long-term permanent disability among adult . Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) currently safe medical treatment acute ischemic stroke small fraction patient eligible thrombolysis treatment . Current guideline thrombolysis post stroke tPA exclude use beyond 3 hour stroke onset time onset unknown thus exclude many patient potentially beneficial treatment . For appropriate triage management patient , essential improve image technique beyond simple CT scan . Perfusion compute tomography ( PCT ) , currently consider investigational technique , permit quantitative determination cerebral perfusion within brain . It help distinguish salvageable ischemic penumbra irreversibly infarcted core acute stroke patient . This technique therefore potential select patient likely benefit thrombolysis tPA , use predict benefit thrombolysis determine suitability therapeutic intervention . In patient primary diagnosis TIA , PCT would help identify possible persistent cerebral ischemia also provide important information rapid instigation prophylactic strategy . The diagnosis management patient ischemic stroke TIA challenge primarily base clinical assessment conjunction neuroimaging . Development specific molecular biomarkers additional tool support clinical diagnosis , exclude common stroke mimic migraine epileptic seizure , identify patient risk disease , help guide patient treatment predict complication follow t-PA treatment would great value .</brief_summary>
