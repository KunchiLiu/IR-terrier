	<detailed_description>Introduction Fluid Administration Critically Ill Patients . Fluids one common therapy use critically ill patient . Fluids cornerstone hemodynamic management . In overt bleeding , fluid often give without guidance specific haemodynamic monitoring . In condition hypovolemia may subtle response fluid variable , fluid often give titrable way , monitor haemodynamic impact . This practice , call fluid challenge technique propose Max Harry Weil 30 year ago [ 1 ] . Fluids beneficial impact outcome , especially context hemodynamic optimization . Haemodynamic optimization show improve patient outcome apply perioperative period early phase septic shock [ 2,3 ] . On hand , positive fluid balance associate poor outcome [ 4,5 ] , may reflect patient severity . In patient respiratory failure , hemodynamically stable , fluid restriction associate early separation mechanical ventilation [ 4 ] . Altogether , seem reasonable give amount fluid need patient hemodynamically unstable restrict fluid patient stabilize . Such approach seem associate well outcome [ 6 ] . The fluid challenge use several paper study assess response patient fluid . The way practice perform varies term : - type fluid - volume fluid - rate fluid administration - clinical endpoint use There data describe fluid challenge administer ICU 's across world . Understanding provide valuable information regard current practice would basis improve current practice future research . Fluids guideline Current guideline fluid administration cover give fluid critically ill patient exist . In survive sepsis guideline fluid recommend early phase hemodynamic resuscitation patient severe sepsis [ 7 ] . At stage recommend administer accord CVP [ 7 ] . In france , use functional hemodynamic test ( see ) recommend set [ 8 ] . After initial phase , guideline evasive way fluid guide . In UK guideline cover administration fluid perioperative setting . In periopoerative setting high risk surgical patient , guideline recommend use fluid stroke volume optimization { 9 } Apart specific setting , fluid administration cover current guideline . Prediction fluid responsiveness use Functional haemodynamic test Heart Lung Interaction fully mechanically ventilated patient During mechanical ventilation , increase intra-thoracic pressure induce inspiration , decrease venous return right ventricle . If right ventricle 'volume ' responsive , result reduction right ventricular stroke volume , subsequently translate decreased leave ventricular stroke volume , several beat later . This change stroke volume ( stroke volume variation ) detect monitor track real-time change stroke volume stroke volume variation . ' When two ventricle work ascend part stroke volume/ventricular preload curve , mechanical ventilation induce change stroke volume reflect , depend monitor use , change stroke volume ( Stroke Volume Variation , SVV ) , pulse pressure ( Pulse Pressure Variation PPV ) , systolic pressure ( Systolic Pressure Variation , SPV ) . These also call dynamic index preload , detect change , provide information preload reserve ventricle ( fluid responsiveness ) . Therefore predict patient may benefit fluid administration prior give fluid . This widely study several monitor prove effective predict fluid responsiveness high sensitivity specificity [ 10 ] . These technique limitation . In order reliable patient need fully sedate mechanically ventilate , spontaneous breathing activity arrhythmia . Also , report De Backer et al . index lose power predict fluid responsiveness patient ventilate volume low 8 ml/kg [ 11 ] . Heart Lung Interaction spontaneously breathe patient Passive leg raise maneuvre produce autologous fluid challenge shift venous blood leg intra-thoracic compartment . The response measure flow monitor able predict response fluid challenge [ 12 ] . This studied different monitor . In set spontaneously breathe patient Monge Garcia et al . demonstrate change pressure Valsalva manoeuvre predict fluid responsiveness ( The Valsalva maneuvre force expiration close glottis ) [ 13 ] . Summary evidence A summary evidence relate use fluid context haemodynamic resuscitation suggest : 1 . During perioperative period early phase septic shock , administration target fluid optimize pre-load provide improvement patient outcome . 2 . There evidence protocol aim optimize cardiac output beneficial patient apply `` early '' oxygen debt establish . 3 . Observational study show positive fluid balance associate increase 60 day mortality . 4 . Despite , patient remain unstable initial fluid resuscitation often receive fluid attempt reverse shock . 5 . Functional Haemodynamic test develop help clinician predict response fluid administration . 6 . How decision give give fluid make different disease , different ICU 's different country know . 7 . How often functional haemodynamic test use know either . 8 . How effect fluids monitor know either . This study give answer point 6 , 7 8 . The way fluid administer vary widely . Indications fluid monitor effect standardize may thus lead heterogeneity practice . The purpose study evaluate fluid administer What study involve ? 1 . All patient enrol study receive standard clinical care 2 . Data collect order study fluid challenge perform ICU 's 3 . No extra test perform study 4 . Only measurements data available part clinical practice collect</detailed_description>
