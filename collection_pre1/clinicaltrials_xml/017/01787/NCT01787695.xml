	<detailed_description>Vitiligo chronic acquire disease characterize well define white macule patch affect skin mucous membrane . Mucocutaneous lesion develop secondary selective destruction melanocyte . The etiology vitiligo largely unknown likely multifactorial . There several theory pathogenesis vitiligo include mainly autoimmune , neurohormonal , autocytotoxic theory . The autoimmune hypothesis strong evidence alteration mainly cellular immune response . There many treatment modality available vitiligo , however , none cure disease . These include different topical treatment , phototherapy , surgical therapy , depigmentation therapy . Narrow-band UVB ( NB-UVB ) currently prefer treatment topical psoralen ultraviolet A radiation ( PUVA ) , patient vitiligo . However , overall response vitiligo NB-UVB variable . Ultraviolet A1 ( UVA1 ) phototherapy useful variety skin disease , specifically scleroderma . There study publish efficacy UVA1 vitiligo . One main side effect UVA1 prominent tan might due melanocyte stimulation . Therefore , investigator hypothesis UVA1 induce significant skin pigmentation improve vitiligo . The investigator plan conduct prospective single-blind randomize clinical trial ass efficacy safety UVA1 treatment vitiligo . Study Objectives 1 . To evaluate potential UVA1 induce repigmentation within vitiligo patch . 2 . To assess side effect profile UVA1 use treatment vitiligo .</detailed_description>
