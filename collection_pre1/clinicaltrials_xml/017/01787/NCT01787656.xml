	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer deadly generally diagnose late stage chance survival low . There current belief cancer start fallopian tube progress towards ovary , spread cell surface . Within fallopian tube uterus , constant flow mucus one exit cervix vagina . Proteins generate within entire female reproductive system trap viscous fluid eventually release waste . When routine PAP test perform , sample mucus collect along cell , preserve PAP fluid . The fluid currently discard contains protein profile show status cell female reproductive system . We examine fluid find contains unique peptides/proteins provide diagnosis ovarian cancer compare healthy control . These marker initially refine use comparison ovarian cancer patient benign adnexal mass enter clinic time period . In Phase II biomarker validation study refine validate biomarkers use new collection sample least 200 ovarian cancer case epithelial ovarian cancer ( endometroid papillary serous histology , common ) compare 600 patient diagnosis benign adnexal mass enter clinic time period . Patient sample collect first visit gynecologic oncologist number collaborate clinic . Final processing sample perform within proteomics research facility Mitchell Cancer Institute use Selected Reaction Monitoring ( SRM , mass spectrometry ) base refine set maker statistically select within first aim . Biomarkers validate within study compare well accept CA-125 data patient . The research involve three year validation may allow detection cancer early stage survival high 90 % . One aim examine self-taken test could allow use medically underrepresented rural area .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Must fully consent collection sample write ( complete consent form ) . 2 . Age Criteria : Women age 50 old post menopausal ( defined 12 month past last menstrual period ) . 3 . Must : Diagnosis adnexal mass suspicion ovarian cancer , suspect fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . 4 . Must uterus cervix . 5 . Surgery adnexal mass must anticipate . ( Only patient adnexal mass require surgery eligible ) . 1 . Any subject condition would increase risk associate standard sampling procedure ( Such pap smear , cotton swab vagina ) 2 . Prior hysterectomy . 3 . Absence adnexal mass . 4 . Primary diagnosis cancer ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube . 5 . Patients grossly visible cervical cancer . 6 . Previous/recent treatment invasive gynecologic cancer . 7 . Recent chemotherapy within prior 2 year . ( recent neoadjuvant chemotherapy ovarian cancer would exclude patient participation ) . 8 . Cervical conization within prior 6 month . 9 . History Radiation therapy pelvis , vagina cervix . 10 . Obvious advanced stage cancer ( Stage III IV ) presentation , know prior specimen collection .</criteria>
