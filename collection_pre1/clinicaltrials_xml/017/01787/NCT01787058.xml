	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SPECIFIC AIMS Household-based water , sanitation hygiene ( WASH ) improvement demonstrate reduction diarrheal . However , little academically sound research impact school-based program . The small body current evidence promising ; school-based WASH intervention associate reduction absenteeism , particularly among girl . School WASH program also demonstrate decrease diarrheal disease helminth reinfection rate among school child . In 2010 , consortium UNICEF , CARE Mali , Oxfam GB , WaterAid Mali Save Children launch implement WASH program 700 primary school across Mali Dubai Cares WASH Schools Initiative ( DC Mali Initiative ) . Core activity project include : instal rehabilitate school water point , latrine hygiene kit ; promote good WASH practice behavior change school within community ; establish management system ensure sustained financing , monitor maintenance . The specific aim study quantify impact DC Mali Initiative pupil learn health . Using longitudinal data collection , investigator assess absenteeism , diarrhea , respiratory infection 100 intervention school compare result observe 100 control school . DATA COLLECTION ACTIVITIES Facility Observations conduct trained study enumerator use electronic data collection device . The observation school facility specifically , student . Structured Director Interviews administer school director . In case school director available , adjunct director knowledge school WASH facility interview . Responses record electronic data collection device train enumerator . The questionnaire address presence functionality school WASH facility , take 20 minute . The information collect interview report state facility school sensitive personal information . Structured Pupil Interviews administer random sample 40 pupils school . Pupils grade 3-6 ( typically age 7-14 ) eligible sample . As longitudinal study , pupil interview visit . New pupil select start second academic year September 2013 replace pupil graduate drop 2012-2013 academic year . Upon initial recruitment obtain informed oral assent , pupil name record master list participant , assign ID participant . This list keep confidential enumerator . Enumerators record correspond ID number data collection form , name permanently record database . Pupil interview response record electronic data device train enumerator . The interview address recent history school absenteeism , diarrheal illness , respiratory illness . Pupils also provide information age , grade , presence latrine home , academic grade previous year . The pupil interview take five minute per pupil . Interviews conduct either French local language , accord preference pupil . A Roll Call take pupils school day visit . Upon first visit , enumerator record list pupil enrol school . These list data kept confidential enumerator show school administrator others involve research . At data collection visit , enumerator call name pupil class mark whether pupil absent . This method use triangulate attendance data school roster record . Aggregate data visit record database without personal identifying information . Handwashing observation make pupil upon exit latrine . Enumerators observe latrine area 20 minute tally whether pupil use water and/or soap leave latrine . No names personal identifying information collect . An Academic Data Review conduct three time throughout 2012-13 2013-14 school year determine percentage child obtain passing average , percentage child advance next class , percentage drop-outs school . Only school-level data , disaggregated gender grade , collect review . No individual personal data collect activity . DATA MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING This trial entail medical intervention kind ; therefore , typical data safety monitoring plan necessary . Study staff instruct monitor unforeseen situation suggest increase risk participant immediately inform study manager decision make mitigate risk . RISKS AND BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATION Participation study subject participant excess risk brief five-minute interruption class time classroom roll call , five-minute break class pupil participant leave class interview . There direct benefit participant know information gain study contribute knowledge WASH sector worldwide educational health impact improve WASH school . Schools participate control place high consideration DC Mali Initiative partner future intervention . CONFIDENTIALITY Names pupil participant record separately survey form destroy data collection complete . This information retain separate ID link form ensure pupil contact repeat visit school . Private health data relate recent history diarrhea respiratory illness link demographic information include age , gender , school , school grade ; however , information insufficient serve identifier . No identifier leave Mali INFORMED CONSENT The Malian Ministry Education grant waiver parental consent pupil interview . At school , school director ask sign loco parentis ( `` place parent '' ) behalf pupil participant . These form inform director activity purpose research give permission researcher carry short interview school consent pupil . In addition loco parentis form , pupil subject select respond pupil interview read full informed oral assent script first time interview conduct . They provide oral assent choose participate longitudinal study . Continued assent obtain pupil commence subsequent data collection round . Oral assent rather write choose due varying level literacy school well desire minimize paperwork contain participant ' name . Investigators expect sample 60 pupil per school . Therefore , school director would sign loco parentis form 60 pupils school . This form sign first visit , serve consent subsequent visit . A total 200 loco parentis form collect school director . A maximum 12,000 oral assent record pupil first round data collection , equal number assent follow data collection round .</detailed_description>
