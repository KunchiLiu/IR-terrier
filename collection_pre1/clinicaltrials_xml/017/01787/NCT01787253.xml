	<brief_summary>Objective : This study aim elucidate pathophysiological link environment colon ( mainly microbiota ) , local immune system activation enteric nervous system patient post-infectious IBS ( PI-IBS ) microscopic colitis ( MC ) special emphasis microbial-mucosa interaction evaluation effect immune activation/response well afferent gut-brain signal lead abdominal discomfort . Method : The project base data three cohort patient , one PI-IBS one MC well gender- age-matched cohort healthy individual . Measurement perceive sensitivity gut evaluate pain-response mechanical stress use barostat . The HIT ( Human intestinal Tissue ) -Chip array use characterize diversity , stability functionality intestinal microbiota mucosa level , give clue interaction host insight change lead development two disease . Immunohistochemistry flowcytometry use analyse location , frequency phenotype characteristic lymphoid- mast cell . Functional analysis mucosal lymphocytes activate vitro product intestinal microbiota examine cytokine production use LuminexTM system . The Ussing chamber technique allow investigation impact microbiota metabolites intestinal barrier function . In method sample access stressor standard condition .</brief_summary>
