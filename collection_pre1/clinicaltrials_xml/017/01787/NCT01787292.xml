	<brief_title>Effects Exercise Intervention Aging-related Motor Decline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The U.S. Census report 14 million U.S. Veterans ( &gt; 63 % ) beyond mid-life ( &gt; 55 year ) . Declines upper extremity motor performance respective strength dexterity well document within age cohor ) . Recent cross-sectional research discover age related motor deficit may influence loss interhemispheric inhibition ( IHI ) primary motor cortex . However , loss may inevitable consequence age . Work previous VA OAA Predoctoral CDA-1 award show aerobic fitness may serve mitigate loss interhemispheric inhibition assess functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . That , individual aerobically fit show high level IHI improve dexterity reaction time . In light new evidence investigator ' lab 's recent cross-sectional study , physical activity long term ( least 2-5 year ) may serve alter level IHI improve motor performance upper extremity . Aerobic exercise may provide mechanism ( reduced loss interhemispheric inhibition ) could serve improve motor function , neural mechanism responsible effect remain unclear . Previous investigation interhemispheric communication exercise limited nature inquiry , cross-sectional research measure change time participant . As , currently unknown exercise may directly affect level interhemispheric communication motor performance . Behavioral intervention ( motor strength coordination ) show effective improve upper extremity motor performance old adult , however duration gain appear short-lived . After little week detrain , motor strength coordination upper extremity rapidly begin return pre-intervention level . Evidence exercise intervention assess gait locomotion show exercise program long term ( &gt; 6 month ) associate improved proprioception , few fall well balance . However , comparison outcome upper extremity function elderly adult respective exercise duration remain largely unexplored . In addition compare effect short-term exercise ( 3 month ) versus behavioral training ( 3 month ) upper extremity function , current proposal evaluate longer-term ( 6 month ) exercise program maintain enhance upper extremity function associate level interhemispheric inhibition . The current study proposes next logical step line research directly investigate effect exercise intervention sedentary old Veterans ( 50-80 year ) , group likely exhibit aging-related motor deficit . The investigator propose enroll 40 Veterans upper extremity dexterity improvement program involve behavioral exercise component . The behavioral intervention muscle coordination train previously show improve unimanual motor performance old adult . The exercise intervention supervise group cycle regimen . The figure show study design . Interhemispheric communication assess fMRI , TMS .</detailed_description>
