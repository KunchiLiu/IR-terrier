	<brief_summary>The purpose study clinically radiographically assess whether use ridge preservation technique significantly minimize alveolar ridge resorption follow tooth extraction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Socket Grafting Alveolar Ridge Preservation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects require single-rooted tooth extraction future tooth replacement therapy implant-supported restoration recruit . Subjects randomly assign either control ( tooth extraction alone ) experimental group ( tooth extraction ridge preservation use allograft fill alveolar socket cover non-absorbable , dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane [ dPTFE ] ) . Clinical linear measurement ridge ( horizontal vertical ) obtain use tooth-supported stent . Following extraction , primary closure socket attempt . Subjects re-evaluated 1 4 week . Implant placement surgery perform 16 week . Clinical measurement repeat upon surgical re-entry . Cone beam compute tomographic ( CBCT ) scan obtain baseline ( tooth extraction ) 14 week ( prior implant placement ) ass alveolar ridge volumetric change ( primary outcome ) . Secondary outcome measure include change bucco-lingual apico-coronal clinical measurement ridge change modify wound heal index change overtime . The influence thickness facial lingual bone alveolar ridge width keratinize tissue remodel ridge evaluate .</detailed_description>
