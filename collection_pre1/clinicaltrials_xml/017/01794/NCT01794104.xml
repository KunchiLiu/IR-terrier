	<brief_summary>Background : - Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 experimental cancer treatment drug . It damage DNA tumor cell . Tumor cell damage DNA may die , result cell death . Researchers want see drug safe effective treatment solid tumor lymphomas respond earlier treatment . Objectives : - To see Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 safe effective treatment advance solid tumor lymphomas . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age solid tumor lymphomas respond treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Tumor sample may also collect . The size location tumor determine image study . - Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 give 28-day cycle . Participants receive drug intravenous infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , follow break 13 day without drug . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . Tumor sample optional . - Participants continue cycle treatment long cancer grow severe side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 Advanced Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Indenoisoquinolines non-camptothecin topoisomerase ( Top1 ) inhibitor form stable DNA-Top1 cleavage-complexes , preference unique DNA cleavage site , active camptothecin-resistant cell line . Unlike camptothecins , indenoisoquinolines chemically stable active cell over-express ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter ABCG2 multidrug resistance ( MDR-1 ) . Top1 inhibitor potent anticancer agent stabilize cleavage complex formation induces replication-and transcription-mediated DNA damage delay DNA repair , lead apoptosis . Preclinical clinical data indicate baseline tumor level Top1 correlate strongly ability respond Top1 inhibitor therapy . - A first-in-human Phase I study conduct NCI indenoisoquinoline LMP400 ( NSC 743400 ) QD x 5 q28 schedule patient refractory solid tumor lymphomas ( 10-C-0056 ) establish agent well tolerate . LMP400 show linear pharmacokinetics evidence drug accumulation follow 5 day dose . We hypothesize weekly dosing ( day 1 , 8 , 15 q28-day cycle ) increase LMP400 peak level exposure , improve clinical activity safety . Primary Objectives : - To establish safety tolerability weekly ( day 1 , 8 , 15 q28-day cycle ) LMP400 patient refractory solid tumor lymphomas . - To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) weekly LMP400 patient refractory solid tumor lymphomas . - To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile weekly LMP400 . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate level Top1 tumor biopsy pre- post- administration LMP400 . - Evaluate effect LMP400 marker DNA damage apoptosis , &gt; =H2AX caspase 3 , tumor biopsy pre- post- LMP400 administration . Eligibility : -Patients histologically confirm metastatic solid tumor lymphomas ; adequate organ function . Study Design : - This open-label Phase I trial evaluate weekly administration LMP400 , day 1 , 8 , 15 , 28-day cycle . - Starting dose base MTD determine QD x 5 , q28 day schedule currently evaluate . The study follow 3 plus 3 design . - Once MTD establish , 10 additional patient enrol MTD define pharmacokinetics evaluate effect study drug DNA damage apoptosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologicallydocumented ( confirmed Laboratory Pathology , NCI ) , solid tumor malignancy , Hodgkin 's disease/nonHodgkin lymphoma , metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist associate minimal patient survival benefit . The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Leukocytes great equal 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin less equal 2.0 x institutional upper limit normal ( allow patient Gilbert syndrome total bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 x institutional upper limit normal patient metastatic disease liver less equal 5 x ULN Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal OR Creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/minute patient creatinine level great equal 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal Age great equal 18 The effect indenoisoquinolines develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month completion indenoisoquinolines administration . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 3 month completion indenoisoquinolines administration Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must recover least eligibility level due adverse event ( AEs ) and/or toxicity prior chemotherapy biologic therapy . They must major surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , 2 month UCN01 ) . Patients must great equal to2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study ( also refer early Phase I study prePhase I study subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) PI discretion , recover eligibility level toxicity . However , patient receive bisphosphonates cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer eligible therapy . Prior therapy topoisomerase I inhibitors allow . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know active brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients brain metastasis stable least 4 week follow surgery and/or radiation eligible . Uncontrolled incurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction LMP400 . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES : Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial .</criteria>
