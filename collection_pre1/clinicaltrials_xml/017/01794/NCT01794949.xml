	<brief_summary>The use drug elute stent ( DES ) use treat coronary artery blockage limit poor healing stented area . This require combine use blood thinner aspirin clopidogrel ( i.e . dual anti-platelet therapy ( DAPT ) ) prevent complication clot formation stent may lead heart attack . Diabetic patient present heart attack time stent placement increase risk clot formation . However , little known healing response stent placement population . Currently patient receive DES advise complete DAPT twelve month although personalized duration DAPT base stent heal would reduce clot formation potential bleeding blood thinner , thereby improve long-term safety DES . Intracoronary optical frequency domain imaging ( OFDI ) novel high resolution invasive imaging technique ability evaluate stent heal follow-up . Among commercially available coated stent use U.S. , zotarolimus elute stent ( RESOLUTE Integrity , Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN ) demonstrate superior heal preclinical clinical study . The purpose trial determine healing response RESOLUTE Integrity stent detect OFDI patient without diabetes present ACS . Specifically , observational study , study team investigate non-insulin dependent diabetic non-diabetics set ACS RESOLUTE Integrity stent placement . The investigator hypothesize heal response patient non-insulin dependent diabetes similar without diabetes present ACS majority patient demonstrate complete healing determine OFDI measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term efficacy drug elute stent ( DES ) use treat symptomatic coronary artery disease limit incomplete healing stented segment necessitating use dual anti-platelet therapy ( DAPT ) aspirin thienopyridine prevent late thrombotic complication . Diabetic patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) time DES placement increase risk late stent thrombosis , however , little known healing response population . Currently patient receive DES advise complete DAPT twelve month although personalized duration DAPT base stent heal would reduce thrombosis bleeding , thereby improve long-term safety DES . Intracoronary optical frequency domain imaging ( OFDI ) novel high resolution invasive imaging modality potential discern plaque morphology stent placement stent strut heal follow-up . Among commercially available coated stent use U.S. , zotarolimus elute stent ( RESOLUTE , Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN ) demonstrate superior endothelialization long term safety data preclinical clinical study . The purpose trial determine healing response RESOLUTE stent detect OFDI patient without diabetes present ACS . Specifically , investigator 1 ) determine use OFDI whether difference heal occurs non-insulin dependent diabetic patient present ACS RESOLUTE stent placement 6 month ; 2 ) determine initial plaque morphology angiographic measure late loss correlate stent strut healing ; 3 ) examine whether select biomarkers utility predict stent strut heal OFDI . Investigators conduct clinical study image subject baseline 6 month stent placement intracoronary OFDI . OFDI data utilized determine plaque morphology prior intervention , ensure adequate strut apposition stent size immediately post deployment measure stent strut coverage 6 month follow-up . Two follow-up imaging pass conduct evaluate test-retest variability coverage measurement . In addition assess feasibility use OFDI coverage metric vivo , data may provide information magnitude coverage expect 6 month follow RESOLUTE stent .</detailed_description>
