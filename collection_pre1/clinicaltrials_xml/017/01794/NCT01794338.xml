	<brief_summary>This study evaluate outcome patient treated Strattice Gore Bio-A mesh repair complicate abdominal wall hernia . The purpose study collect information evaluate outcome surgery . Synthetic ( man make ) mesh show provide durable long-term outcome ; however , type mesh use patient risk develop infection . Therefore , address challenge find artificial strengthen material repair complicate hernias patient could potentially develop surgical infection , two type non-permanent material develop , include biologics bioabsorbables . Biologic mesh make live tissue bioabsorbable mesh make synthetic material gradually absorb body time . The purpose study allow surgeon compare postoperative course patient associate two mesh type decide material improve outcome patient complicate abdominal wall defect . To date evidence suggest either mesh type superior safer .</brief_summary>
