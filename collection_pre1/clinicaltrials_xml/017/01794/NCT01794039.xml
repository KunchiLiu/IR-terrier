	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well pomalidomide dexamethasone work compare lenalidomide dexamethasone treat patient multiple myeloma return period improvement ( relapse ) respond previous treatment lenalidomide ( refractory ) . Pomalidomide lenalidomide may help immune system kill cancer cell may also prevent growth new blood vessel tumor need grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Dexamethasone may also help pomalidomide lenalidomide work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . It yet know whether pomalidomide dexamethasone lenalidomide dexamethasone effective treating patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess confirm response rate combination lenalidomide dexamethasone patient relapse myeloma previously become refractory lenalidomide . ( Arm A ) II . To assess confirm response rate combination pomalidomide dexamethasone patient relapse myeloma previously become refractory lenalidomide . ( Arm B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity arm patient relapse myeloma previously receive lenalidomide . II . To assess response rate pomalidomide dexamethasone patient relapse lenalidomide dexamethasone . ( Arm A ) III . To assess time progression overall survival approach . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience progressive disease may crossover arm B . ARM B : Patients receive pomalidomide PO daily day 1-21 dexamethasone arm A . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
