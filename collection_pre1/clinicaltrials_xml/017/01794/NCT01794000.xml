	<brief_title>A Study Prasugrel Pediatric Participants With Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The submission database validate data report data cutoff date submission database lock ( SDBL ) . The SDBL data cutoff 17 July 2015 participant except 2 young age group , SDBL data cutoff occur 08 August 2015 . The data cutoff date SDBL correspond primary completion date study . The SDBL occur 31 August 2015 . The study stop follow SDBL review topline information indicate primary secondary efficacy endpoint meet . Subsequently , Sponsor request participant discontinue study drug immediately discontinuation visit active study participant conduct soon feasible . After data cutoff date SDBL , Sponsor continue collect safety data final participant contact ; additional efficacy data collect final visit . The last patient visit ( LPV ) occur 17 December 2015 , correspond study completion date lead plan supplemental database lock ( PSDBL ) 22 January 2016 . This supplemental data base originally design capture additional blind randomized information enhance safety data label study positive . The safety information contain record reflect entire safety information reflect information supplemental data base lock January 2016 . The efficacy information contain record reflect information collect primary completion date submission database . Primary analysis major efficacy objective repeat use entire double-blind period data PSDBL change original conclusion consistent result original efficacy analysis include SDBL .</detailed_description>
