	<brief_summary>When patient receives kidney transplant particularly kidney old donor one kidney remove heart stop , risk newly transplant kidney may function immediately . If delay function mean dialysis need first 7 day transplantation know delayed graft function dDGF . Also delay graft function require dialysis present serum creatinine fall sufficiently know functional delayed graft function fDGF . This problem often due excessive inflammatory reaction blood supply time donation transplant . OPN-305 monoclonal antibody block Toll-like Receptor 2 think partly responsible increase risk inflammation . It hop effect inflammation reduce therefore prevent dDGF fDGF occur . The purpose study explore effective OPN-305 preventing dDGF fDGF well improve measure kidney function overall safety antibody . In first part study , patient receive Infusion one three possible dos OPN-305 placebo second part suitable dose OPN-305 placebo would use . The purpose second part study find dose OPN-305 already test earlier part study prevent kidney graft dysfunction . For purpose study , kidney function assess use composite delay graft function ( dDGF ) dialysis necessary first 7 day functional delayed graft function require dialysis present serum creatinine , key measure renal function , fall sufficiently ( fDGF ) first 7 day post-transplant . Protocol OPN305-103 follow 12 month post-transplant clinical status graft function patient complete 6-month post-transplant period Part A Part B OPN305-102 .</brief_summary>
