	<detailed_description>Participants send personal medical questionnaire family history questionnaire complete prior visit . Participants meet genetic counselor face-to-face 120 minute complete personal family history . Participants receive genetic counseling include education MEN1 syndrome recommendation management disease . The genetic counselor also assist participant cop mentally . The genetic counselor review risk , benefit limitation genetic testing . After study eligibility confirm participant agrees participate study , approximately 10 ml ( 2 teaspoon ) blood take participant genetic testing . Tumor sample prior surgery request Jersey Shore University Medical Center pathology department review . The participant 's blood sample tumor sample assign unique identifier . Participants identify name . This identifier , along participant 's age , sex , ethnicity applicable , age cancer diagnosis ( MEN1 syndrome diagnosis ) keep Jersey Shore University Medical Center research department . Medical record review demographic , know cancer risk factor , family history , age stage diagnosis disease , tumor characteristic , previous current treatment , medication history , test study result , pathology/surgery report . Blood tumor sample send Functional Genomics Facility The Cancer Institute New Jersey Rutgers University Cell &amp; DNA Repository process and/or analysis identify genetic pattern patient risk MEN1 . The result genetic test MEN1 gene provide participant either genetic counselor study doctor . The genetic counselor study doctor interrupt result participant provide emotional support , necessary . The result alter gene disclose participant . Medical record review annually determine status participant 's disease , . Participants contact directly phone person follow-up clinic visit ( ) collection information record participant 's medical record 20 year .</detailed_description>
