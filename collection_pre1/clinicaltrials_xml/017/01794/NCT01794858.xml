	<brief_summary>Background : Acute pancreatitis characterize high mortality rate ( 10 % -15 % ) , remarkably unpredictable clinical course . Approximately 50 % death acute pancreatitis occur early—within first 14 days—and early mortality attributable sequela severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , associate multi-organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) escalate renal failure , respiratory failure , death . Significant improvement acute pancreatitis mortality demand innovative approach counteract early organ failure . A series destructive cellular process begin within minute initial pancreatic injury , ensue inflammatory cascade compound disease sequela include edema , ischemia , tissue necrosis . Early intervention reduce inflammation within first 36 hour show significant effect minimize progressive organ dysfunction . Hypothermia clinically employ combat cellular injury systemic response follow ischemia-reperfusion , study mechanism acute inflammatory inhibition process include cardiogenic shock , lung injury , local intestinal injury , reperfusion injury lung , liver , endothelium . In numerous study , effective immunomodulations observe include reduction pro-inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-α , IL-6 ) , stimulation anti-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-10 ) , inhibition pro-apoptotic JNK signaling , reduction systemic oxidative stress , inhibition neutrophil , monocyte , monocyte-derived macrophage . Most saliently , caerulein model murine acute pancreatitis , therapeutic hypothermia show reduce serum IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-α , increase serum IL-10 , decrease serum amylase lipase , low histological grade pancreatic injury compare normothermic mouse , significant survival benefit . Although therapeutic hypothermia actively employ treatment traumatic brain injury , neonatal asphyxia , spinal cord injury , cardiac arrest , study yet make application acute pancreatitis . Hypothesis : Patients treat therapeutic hypothermia ( 32-34°C ) sustain reduce organ-specific injury acute pancreatitis . Proposal : In Phase IIa pilot clinical trial , examine effect therapeutic hypothermia organ-specific outcome early stage acute pancreatitis . We recruit five patient age 18 80 receive medically-necessitated ventilator support ICU monitoring core temperature ≥36°C severe acute pancreatitis define either Ranson Score ≥7 , CT indicate ≥50 % pancreatic necrosis , significant deterioration clinical status include dysfunction two organ system ( defined ACCP/SCCM Organ Failure Guidelines , Chest 2009 ) . All patient receive current standard management severe acute pancreatitis standardize protocol application therapeutic hypothermia rewarming . Our primary endpoint organ-specific cardiovascular , respiratory , hematological , renal , metabolic dysfunction measure 28 day . Logistic Organ Dysfunction Scores ( LOD ) compare therapeutic hypothermia , establish day 4 versus day 1 change LOD . Secondary endpoint include D-dimer , IL-6 , C-reactive protein , APACHE II score day 1 day 4 , inpatient ICU length-of-stay , infection , mortality , hypothermia-associated side effect include cardiac arrhythmia , electrolyte imbalance , hyperglycemia , major bleeding , acute pancreatitis . We believe study supply preliminary answer chief research question : therapeutic hypothermia reduce morbidity assess organ-specific outcome , therapeutic hypothermia attenuate steep rise inflammation observe severe acute pancreatitis , therapeutic hypothermia shorten clinical course patient .</brief_summary>
