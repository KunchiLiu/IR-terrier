	<detailed_description>Obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) affect 1-3 % population fourth common mental disorder . It characterize preoccupy obsessional doubt harm , illness , disorder bad luck , occur compulsive action carry neutralize risk . Treatments choice include pharmacotherapy cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) either alone combination . Although intervention clinically effective , usually reduce obsession sub-clinical level . There risk relapse even sizeable minority people OCD refuse abandon treatment , specific subtypes OCD show minimal response .

In model obsess begin point person cross reality initial obsessional doubt since doubt base real perception subjective narrative mislead person infer doubt doubt require . Over last 10 year , experimental , clinical psychometric research study ( independently replicate ) support essential claim IBA lead development inference-based therapy ( IBT ) . A small scale randomize clinical trial , clinical case study establish IBT 'promising ' intervention ( accord American Psychological Association criterion ) show IBT seem offer advantage conventional CBT , particularly treatment-resistant case over-invest obsessional conviction . The current randomized clinical trial compare IBT CBT usual , third active control condition mindfulness . Mindfulness generic treatment show effective range psychiatric problem seek calm thought redirect mental focus meditative distancing . The mindfulness condition non-specific cognitive control confound effect mood change symptom relief . CBT follow 'appraisal ' model either restructuring appraisal beliefs obsession de-dramatizing anxious expectation exposure reality testing ( combine E/RP ) . IBT seek change reason lead initial inference doubt principle eliminate doubt logically necessarily eliminate anticipated consequence accompany obsessional anxiety . All three treatment manualized administer experienced professional therapist supervise co-investigator allegiance one three approach . The three treatment model operate distinct process separable stage obsessional chain , therapy component overlap . The principal site choose Montreal Louis-H. Lafontaine Hospital Gatineau Pierre-Janet Hospital . A total 80 participant recruit five-year period treatment modality , give total 240 , permit robust conclusion even weak effect size . Outcome evaluator blind treatment modality independent therapist . All therapy deliver individual weekly basis significant clinical improvement maximum 26 week 6-month follow-up post-treatment . All parameter treatment delivery identical across treatment . All session audio record treatment integrity rat independently . Outcome measure standard DSM-IV base clinical diagnostic scale also psychosocial measure end-point functioning across life domain . Treatment process variable continuously monitor . Refusal attrition calculate 16 % analysis include intention treat . The hypothesis : ( 1 ) treatment effective improve mood reduce symptom ; ( 2 ) IBT superior term : ( ) consistent impact type OCD ; ( b ) low rate relapse . The RCT first kind compare three active treatment impact treatment choice OCD .</detailed_description>
