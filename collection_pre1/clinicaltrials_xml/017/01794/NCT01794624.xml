	<detailed_description>Temporomandibular Joint Disorder ( TMJD ) poorly understood chronic pain disorder characterize pain dysfunction jaw joint muscle control jaw movement . TMJD affect 15 % adult population , differentially impact woman , link great healthcare utilization , associate multiple pain-related co-morbidities . Pain-related catastrophizing ( i.e. , tendency exaggerate threat value pain negatively evaluate one 's ability deal pain ; CAT ) sleep continuity disturbance ( i.e. , disturbance speed sleep initiate degree consolidate ; SCD ) two well establish modifiable risk factor TMJD idiopathic pain condition . SCD define protocol least moderate trouble initiate maintain sleep , significantly impact daytime function . SCD common chronic pain , include TJMD , poor sleep predicts development exacerbation pain . CAT , negative cognitive-emotional predilection response pain , prospectively predict onset exacerbation pain , well numerous pain-related outcome . Surprisingly , neither causal status neurobiological mechanism factor exert effect clinical pain establish . Preliminary data group others suggest CAT SCD independently associate alteration laboratory index pain modulation , exaggerate pain-evoked pro-inflammatory cytokine response amplify clinical pain . While effect CAT SCD independent depression psychological distress , longitudinal experimental study evaluate potential interplay CAT SCD interplay contribute pain outcomes . There strong theoretical reason hypothesize interplay seemingly disparate construct among patient chronic pain . We develop novel , integrate theoretical framework posit CAT SCD influence clinical pain share alteration pain modulation key neurobiological pathway , include amplified inflammatory activity , sympathetic activity , adrenocortical functioning . Beyond share mechanism , however , propose determine whether presleep CAT increase autonomic cortical arousal sleep measure polysomnography ( PSG ) -derived index Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) average relative power alpha beta band quantitative electroencephalography ( QEEG ) . The cognitive dimension pre-sleep arousal , particularly rumination negative sleep-related thought , central phenomenology insomnia . Extending notion , propose CAT experience ongoing clinical pain foster sleep disturbance owe increase pre- peri-sleep cognitive arousal . Moreover , propose pre-sleep CAT relate subtle variation objective index fragment sleep ( e.g. , cortical arousal ) . We examine key hypothesis derive framework use brief , prospective randomize experiment , permit careful analysis temporal patterning change either CAT SCD influence contribute alteration pain modulatory system , key nociceptive mechanism , clinical pain . In 5 year study , 300 woman chronic TMJD reporting least mild trait catastrophizing least mild sleep continuity disturbance complete randomize , parallel group experiment compare cognitive therapy catastrophizing ( CT-CAT ) behavior therapy sleep disturbance ( BT-SCD ) TMJD disease education ( TMJD-ED ) . Subjects randomize ratio 1:1:1 one three intervention . Each subject participate study 30 week . The study include three phase : 1 ) screen baseline ( 10 week ) , 2 ) intervention ( approximately 7 week ) , 3 ) follow-up ( end approximately 12 week final intervention visit ) . Assessments outcome measure ( inflammatory activity , pain modulation , clinical pain , pre-sleep cognitive arousal , cortical autonomic arousal ) make intervention completion intervention , compare baseline assessment . It anticipate enrollment complete four year .</detailed_description>
