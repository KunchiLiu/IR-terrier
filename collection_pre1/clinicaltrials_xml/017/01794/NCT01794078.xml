	<brief_summary>Acute exposure unacclimatized human body high altitude lead health complication , loss exercise performance capacity fatigue . The investigator find combination xanthine drug theophylline endothelin receptor antagonist ambrisentan improves exercise performance capacity rat simulate high altitude . In young , healthy human volunteer , combination drug increase toxicity single compound sea-level condition . The aim study test whether combination theophylline , supply soluble formulation aminophylline , ambrisentan , also safe take simulate high altitude 4,267 meter , rest exercise condition . The study also aim test whether drug combination improve exercise capacity human . In study , human subject randomize one four treatment sequence receive study drug ( ) throughout procedure . The study consist initial exercise test , follow two cycle drug test simulate high altitude : Cycle 1 - resting subject receive study drug simulate altitude continually monitor safety pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic assessment ; Cycle 2 , Cycle 1 , addition exercise testing . It hypothesize combination aminophylline ambrisentan safe simulate high altitude , also improve exercise performance capacity , comparison placebo .</brief_summary>

For purpose study , individual fitness health important family history disease burden criterion participation . For example , individual may significant family history cardiovascular disease ; however , individual subject 's active lifestyle make manifestation disease young age unlikely . To account expected variation , ultimate decision whether exclude include individual base family history manifestation disease make PI . The PI may choose use physiological assessment , e.g . ECG , blood pressure , VO2 max fitness level aid decision making . Any condition might interfere absorption study medication influence interpretation result study .
