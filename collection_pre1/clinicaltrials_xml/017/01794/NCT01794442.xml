	<brief_summary>Retinal ischemia think play important role pathogenesis glaucoma . Recent finding confirm direct correlation level venous oxygen saturation degree glaucomatous disease , presumably due decrease retinal cell metabolism . However , glaucoma patient suggest different pattern retinal venous circulation . For instance , observation visible pulsate central retinal vein phenomenon see 98 % healthy individual identifiable less 50 % glaucoma patient . While nature venous change year clear , lack visible pulsate flow could suggest increase intraluminal venous pressure due obstruction ocular extraocular structure . This undetermined increase venous pulse pressure could significantly decrease perfusion pressure therefore decrease oxygen supply retinal tissue . The investigator therefore try determine significant difference oxygen saturation retinal vessel glaucoma patient without visible pulsate central vein</brief_summary>
