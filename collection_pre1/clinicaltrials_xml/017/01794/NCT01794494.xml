	<detailed_description>Prospective Observation Study Cost Effectiveness Interventions Critical Ischemia Background The incidence arteriosclerotic disease increase age one society 's great public health problem . Impaired circulation lower limb , term peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) common diagnosis old population . Estimates show 10 % population age 70 suffers symptomatic PAD . [ 1 ] Milder form disease cause walk induce pain leg , term intermittent claudication , result variable restriction walk ability . As disease progress , circulatory impairment become pronounce , often result rest pain , impair wound healing , bad case gangrene . These latter stage PAD categorize critical limb ischemia , usually follow pronounced reduction individual 's mobility quality life . The incidence critical limb ischemia Sweden estimate 40 per 100 000 inhabitant , mean year 600 individual Västra Götaland Region ( VGR ) suffer condition . [ 2 ] Untreated critical ischemia lead high risk amputation . Investigations blood circulation patient arterial circulation generally reveal extensive arteriosclerotic vascular lesion include arterial occlusion ( stop ) vessel supply low extremity . Interventions design improve blood flow ability reduce symptom short long term eliminate amputation threat . The establish treatment principle since 1960s bypass surgery . The method involve major open surgery , include period hospitalization high incidence local well general complication . Since decade , minimally invasive technique restore flow occlude artery become widely use . The method term subintimal angioplasty ( SAP ) use catheter guide wire get occlude vessel section , follow balloon dilatation . The method development increase use internationally Sweden . The advantage procedure less risk local systemic complication . The procedure also associate short hospital stay . Disadvantages duration treatment often short procedure often repeat . [ 3 ] It currently unknown SAP cost effective way treat critical limb . Furthermore , impact patient health-related quality life ( HRQL ) short long term unknown . W What role minimally invasive technology future unclear , mainly due efficiency cost-effectiveness compare bypass surgery thoroughly evaluate , point national health technology assessment `` Benartärsjukdom - diagnosis treatment '' . [ 1 ] Purpose The purpose study evaluate effectiveness , cost efficiency , patient benefit include HRQL short long term two principally different method treatment critical limb ischemia far possible unselected clinical population VGR . The effectiveness treatment method evaluate ability prevent amputation , provide symptom improvement , duration treatment ( patency ) , cumulative health care cost two year , effect HRQL . Question / Hypothesis 1 . Endovascular treatment ( SAP ) CLI cost-effective treatment compare open bypass surgery . 2 . SAP associate well HRQL short term comparable HRQL long term ( two year ) compare open bypass surgery . 3 . A clinical study structure identify selection criterion method offer patient primary method critical limb Method : Sample / Representativeness The survey conduct form prospective observational study two cohort follow two year . Inclusion criterion : patient CLI due arterial occlusion superficial femoral artery popliteal artery consider bypass surgery SAP four vascular surgical unit VGR . Exclusion criterion : Patients occlusion level origin superficial femoral artery occlusion , distribution distal popliteal artery . Patients inability understand patient information inform consent . A prospective randomize study high internal validity , often consider great value control comparative observational study . The problem external validity tend low prospective randomize trial often small percentage patient randomize two treatment . The difficulty prospective randomize study type question exemplify BASIL study 20 % patient require treatment CLI randomize study . [ 4 ] The advantage prospective observational study substantially patient region treat critical limb ischemia satisfy exclusion criterion include , external validity high , result may implement clinical practice . Inclusion patient make four unit two year , connection decision treatment . In total 250 patient 2 year include study . Method : Grouping The analysis divide subject bypass surgery undergone endovascular treatment . Methods : The intervention Bypass Surgery : The operation open surgical procedure perform general anesthesia regional anesthesia . [ 5 ] This method mean blood bypass occluded artery new vessel ( usually vein ) . Angioplasty : Using intra arterial catheter technology , guide wire catheter pass occluded vessel section . Balloon dilatation thereafter recreate new channel blood flow . [ 6 ] The surgery minimally invasive procedure do local anesthesia . Method : Data Collection Initial data collection : General information age , presence diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , smoking obtain . A validated scale , Rutherford scale together ankle pressure , assess degree CLI . [ 7 ] Anatomic mapping vessel lesion revascularization perform digital subtraction angiography , MRI CT scan . In order rate extent arterial lesion preoperative investigation examine respect - start point occlusion - length occlusion - distal arterial run-off ( number open leg vessel ) . These data form basis subsequent matching population . Prospective follow-up : Clinical Evaluation : The two treatment group follow one , 12 24 month . At time point , patient examine ankle pressure , ultrasound ( duplex ) clinical condition ( possibly amputation , ischemic degree Rutherford scale ) . Any additional treatment arterial occlusion prevent occlusion study period register . The cost treatment follow prospectively Regional Health Database . After follow-up , calculation treatment cost patient . Health-related quality life : data obtain treatment , 1 month 24 month use Vascular Quality Life Questionnaire ( VascuQol ) design use peripheral arterial disease EQ 5D . Method : Data Processing The treatment effect estimate two group respect : - amputation free survival - patancy - clinical condition - cumulative health care cost - HRQoL Clinical follow-up accordance DEFINE group consensus document follow-up treatment low limb ischemia . [ 7 ] After statistical match population basis prospective data variable , comparative analysis perform . Special analysis make patient population method deem possible implement . Cumulative cost care : Both cost effect method study . Costs follow Regional Health Database admission relate two intervention . The cost complication assign patient gross-costing method , mean price per action cost per complication patient . In word , therefore number type measure number type complication affect cost treatment arm . This affect outcome patient-specific factor relate question study . Efficacy base measurement use EQ-5D result measurement transform utility turn use calculate quality-adjusted life year ( QALYs ) . [ 8 , 9 ] Health-related quality life : VascuQol design use peripheral arterial disease include CLI . The questionnaire consist 25 question 5 domain ( pain , symptom , activity , social emotional ) . [ 11 ] Expected Results / Significance Critical ischemia common cause pain , ulceration gangrene low extremity elderly . The disease cause great suffer victim lead large social cost form high hospitalization consumption . For patient CLI , treatment bypass surgery standard treatment decade . The result suboptimal , data Swedish vascular register , Swedvasc show 3 % die within month , 18 % improve , 10 % amputee within year . Over past 10-15 year , technique endovascular treatment , know subintimal angioplasty , develop spread clinic . The method increasingly use first-line treatment critical limb ischemia , despite lack evidence efficiency cost effectiveness . As healthcare resource limit , essential new treatment evaluate introduced routine method . For ethical reason resource reason , essential patient severe disease may receive , short long term , effective treatment . This study aim clarify effectiveness bypass surgery endovascular treatment critical limb ischemia due occlusion superficial femoral artery / knee artery clinical normal population .</detailed_description>
