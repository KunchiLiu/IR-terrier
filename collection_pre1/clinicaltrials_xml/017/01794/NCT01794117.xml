	<brief_summary>Background : - Inflammatory pustular skin disease type autoinflammatory disease immune system attack body tissue . These disease cause painful itchy skin rash , eye mouth irritation , joint pain fever . Several drug treat disease suppress immune system . However , cause severe side effect take long period time . - IL-1 small protein may important cause inflammation see pustular skin disease . Anakinra drug work block IL-1 . It effective treat inflammatory condition rheumatoid arthritis . However , anakinra study use patient pustular skin disease . Researchers want see whether anakinra effective treat pustular skin disease . Objectives : - To see anakinra use treat inflammatory pustular skin disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age inflammatory pustular skin disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Their disease evaluate blood test , urine test image study . Skin biopsy may also collect . - Participants initial visit receive first dose anakinra . They show give daily injection anakinra . - Participants take anakinra 12 week long severe side effect . During time , keep study diary record severity rash , pustule , itch , fever , skin joint pain . They bring diary study visit . - Participants study visit week 4 , 8 12 . Treatment monitor visit blood test , urine test physical exam . Depending effect treatment , participant may dose anakinra increase decrease . - Participants final study visit 4 week stop take anakinra .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Inflammatory disorder present neutrophilic pustular skin lesion , include generalize pustular psoriasis , characterize severe cutaneous manifestation , generalize inflammation significant morbidity . - Recent study patient phenotypically similar pustular disease identify two monogenic form neutrophilic pustular psoriasis implicate interleukin ( IL ) -1 disease pathogenesis . - Deficiency IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL1RN , DIRA ) autosomal recessive condition characterize severe generalize pustular eruption neonatal period , osteopenia , lytic bone lesion , joint pain , respiratory insufficiency , thrombosis , elevate acute phase reactant significant mortality . Patients condition respond rapidly IL-1 receptor antagonist , anakinra . - Deficiency IL-36 receptor antagonist ( IL-36RN/IL1F5 , DITRA ) autosomal recessive condition episodic widespread pustular skin lesion , fever systemic inflammation define marked leukocytosis elevate creactive protein . - Both IL1RN IL36RN/IL1F5 highly express epidermal keratinocytes , suggest role keratinocytes initiate innate immunity-mediated inflammatory skin disease , ultimately manifest pustular phenotype . - Patients inflammatory pustular disease often respond poorly conventional treatment methotrexate , cyclosporine anti-TNF agent . - Two recent case report describe patient pustular psoriasis unresponsive TNF inhibition respond anti-IL-1 receptor therapy anakinra . We hypothesize monogenic polygenic inflammatory pustular skin disease share common pathogenic mechanism mediate IL-1 . - We propose phase 2 study utilize collaborative bench-to-bedside approach , apply target anti-IL-1 therapy , novel image modality , laboratory technique include immunohistochemistry , gene expression cytokine study , vitro manipulation skin dissect validate pathway complex disease . Objectives : -To characterize clinical efficacy , optimal dose safety anakinra patient pustular dermatosis . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year . - Active macroscopic noninfectious pustular skin lesion involve great equal 5 % total body surface area , palmoplantar involvement . - Histopathologic confirmation epidermal neutrophilic pustulosis . - Patients must maintain stable dose immunosuppressant therapy , retinoids anti-neutrophil therapy 2 week prior study initiation resultant stable worsen skin disease . - Use biologic agent require washout period least 3 half-lives prior study initiation . - Patients must organ marrow function define : - leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL - absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL - platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL - creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Design : - A 16-week , open-label phase 2 study . - Patients initially receive treatment anakinra 100 mg/day self-administered subcutaneous injection . - Disease response assess every 4 week , determination dose escalation make base clinical assessment . Dose escalation increase 200 mg/day , patient &gt; 75 kg 300 mg/day end week 8 . - If response achieve anakinra , immunosuppressant administer purpose treatment pustular skin disease may taper per physician discretion . - Clinical assessment , laboratory subjective data collect in-person every 4 week determine disease response . Telephone assessment perform weekly . - Twenty-five evaluable patient enrol onto trial . The accrual ceiling study set 30 .</detailed_description>
