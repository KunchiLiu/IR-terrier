	<detailed_description>This pilot study . Chronic LBP major health care problem Denmark . Few patient receive specific diagnosis , leave majority patient diagnose non specific low back pain ( NSLBP ) . Classification system help guide treatment NSLBP.This project recruit patient , classify `` flexion pattern '' accord classification system propose Peter O´Sullivan . When classified flexion pattern patient randomize either two treatment arm . Manual therapy ( manipulation soft tissue treatment ) exercise chiropractor classification base biopsychosocial intervention do physiotherapist , ( cognitive/functional approach ) describe Peter O ` Sullivan This pilot study three specific aim : ( ) To determine mean standard deviation numerical rating scale participant set motor control flexion pattern , sample size calculation fully power randomize control trial could perform . ( ii ) To test logistical practical procedure require perform fully power randomize control trial use two treatment .
