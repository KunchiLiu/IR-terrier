	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy 2 physical exercise training program , supplementation fruit vegetable , energy cost walking . 60 subject randomize 2 group . The first program consist interval strength train 30 min bicycle ergometer ( include strengthen exercise high intensity interval training ) . The second program conduct relatively low intensity effort , correspond 50 % oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) peak measure indirect calorimetry . All subject receive free supplement 5 fruit vegetable per day intervention . The intervention last 9 month total : 5 month hospital fallow 4 month home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Reunion Island 2000 , REDIA study show prevalence obesity among woman men 20 % 10 % , respectively . Obesity associate several disease , include diabetes mellitus , hypertension , dyslipidaemia ischaemic heart disease . Regular physical activity associate hypocaloric diet intake fruit vegetable reduce body fat mass obesity-associated complication . However consensus physical training protocol prevention treatment obesity . As consequence , future study require improve obesity management decrease obesity-associated complication . Main objective : compare effect two program rehabilitation train associate diet supplement fruit vegetable reduce energy cost walk obese adult . Secondary objective : compare effect two program rehabilitation train associate diet supplement fruit vegetable : - mechanical property low extremity muscle , - biomechanics walk , - walking intensity , - body composition , - quality life , physical activity compliance motivation , - alimentary behaviour , - oxidative stress inflammatory status . Abstract : Regular physical activity associate hypocaloric diet intake fruit vegetable reduce body fat mass prevent inflammatory oxidative stress associate obesity . Daily physical activity carry bag , make housework , stair climbing , simply walk , recommend increase total daily energy expenditure . However , obese individual higher energy cost walking compare lean counterpart . This high energy cost walk induce high total daily energy expenditure increase activity energy expenditure , inversely , increase exercise intensity reduces walk practice . It show higher energy cost walking could due reduce low extremity muscle strength obese individual . Moreover , muscle strength also reduce weight loss due decrease lean body mass . However , show lean over-weight individual , strength training could induce decrease energy cost walking , make easy walking activity . Thus , propose obese patient compare short- medium-term result two training protocol 5 month , associate diet supplement fruit vegetable , reduce energy cost walking . The study last 9 month total 5 month train period . Participants randomize 2 arm : arm 1 consist interval strength train 30 min bicycle ergometer ( include strengthen exercise high intensity interval training ) , arm 2 consist isocaloric continuous exercise realise moderate intensity ( 50 % Vo2max ) 40 min bicycle ergometer . Participants meet training three time per week 5 month supervision exercise physiologist . All participant initial nutritional education session begin study answer questionnaires train experience 5 month train period ( Exercise difficulty , pain ... ) . At begin study follow-up visit ( 5th 9th month ) , participant : - biological analysis : blood glucose , HbA1c , insulin , cholesterol total , HDL , LDL , triglyceride , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , albumin , creatinine , urinary parameter , antioxidant status , inflammatory marker , - maximal cardiopulmonary exercise , - anthropometric functional examination : weight , height , waist , hip thigh circumference , blood pressure body composition assess dual x-ray absorptiometry , - laboratory test : measurement energy cost walking , walk pattern treadmill , muscle strength , - questionnaire quality life , alimentary behaviour , experience physical activity physical activity compliance motivation .</detailed_description>
