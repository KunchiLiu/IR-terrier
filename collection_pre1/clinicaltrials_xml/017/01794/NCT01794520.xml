	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess safety profile , characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) determine dose schedule , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend phase 2 dose ( RPTD ) ABT-199 ( venetoclax ) administer subject relapse refractory multiple myeloma . This study also assess safety profile PK venetoclax combination dexamethasone subject ( 11 ; 14 ) -positive multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
