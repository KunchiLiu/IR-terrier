	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . As treatment arm assign base histology subtype , must feasible subtype squamous . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) available translational study must provide informed consent release block well blood sample correlative study . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . At least one site disease must unidimensionally measurable follow : Chest Xray ≥ 20 mm CT/MRI scan ( slice thickness &lt; 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm &gt; long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; measure short axis All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization ( within 35 day negative ) . Patients must advance metastatic disease , curative therapy exist systemic therapy indicate . ECOG performance 0 1 . Age ≥ 18 year . Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 14 day prior patient randomization wound heal occur . Chemotherapy : Patients must receive one regimen palliative first line chemotherapy ( must platinum contain combination unless patient 's age &gt; 70 year ) may contain docetaxel . Patients concurrent platinum base chemoradiotherapy stage three disease relapse within one year treatment , patient platinum base adjuvant chemotherapy complete surgical resection relapse within one year treatment , may consider one prior platinum contain regimen . Prior paclitaxel permissible . Patients prior pemetrexed first line therapy randomize Treatment Arm C D ( docetaxel ± reolysin ) . Prior maintenance therapy pemetrexed permit . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy permissible provide complete least 1 year prior relapse/recurrence disease patient receive one regimen palliative first line chemotherapy describe . Other Therapy : Patients may receive therapy include immunotherapy , signal transduction inhibitor , include EGFR inhibitor . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior randomization ) Hematology : Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Biochemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( For patient enrol pemetrexed arm , creatinine clearance must also &gt; 45 ml/min ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN ( unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's disease ) ALT AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( ≤ 3x ULN permit presence know liver metastasis ) Proteinuria &lt; 2g/24hrs ( screen use spot testing ; ≥ grade 2 repeat midstream urine ; still ≥ grade 2 uring collection 24 hour confirm &lt; 2g/24hrs ) . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . Patients history malignancy , except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 3 year . Patients immunosuppressive therapy know HIV infection active hepatitis B C. Patients active uncontrolled infection serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . Patients significant cardiac ( include uncontrolled hypertension ) pulmonary disease , active CNS disease infection . Patients know hypersensitivity study drug ( ) component . Patients untreated brain metastasis , untreated spinal cord compression meningeal metastasis eligible ( CT scan require rule unless clinical suspicion CNS disease ) . Patients treat brain metastasis radiologic evidence stable brain metastasis , evidence cavitation hemorrhage brain lesion , eligible provide asymptomatic require corticosteroid ( must discontinue steroid least 1 week prior randomization ) . Patients neuropathy ≥ grade 2 ( patient plan docetaxel Arms C D ) . Women must postmenopausal , surgically sterile use two reliable form contraception study 6 month discontinue therapy . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test take proven negative within 7 day prior registration/randomization must lactate . Men must surgically sterile use barrier method contraception . Concurrent treatment investigational drug anticancer therapy .</criteria>
