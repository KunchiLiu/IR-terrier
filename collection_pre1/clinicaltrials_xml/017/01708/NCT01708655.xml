	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize measurement beta adrenergic induce sweat rate use evaporimeter accurately reliably determine different level CFTR dysfunction within spectrum patient express various degree cystic fibrosis disease . The investigator overall goal determine whether evaporimeter technique measure beta-adrenergic induced sweat rate capable accurately reliably identify different level CFTR dysfunction , prerequisite advance technique biomarker assay clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sweat Evaporimeter Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary data show follow β-adrenergic stimulation , evaporimetry reliably measure sweat secretion : highly reproducible healthy control ; reduce 50 % CF obligate heterozygote ; absent CF patient carry severe mutation allele . Further , test- retest experiment suggest good intra-individual reliability . All feature satisfy require criterion biomarker assay capable assess small increment CFTR function vivo clinical trial design assess effectiveness correctors potentiators CFTR channel activity . Therefore , provide additional evidence value novel technique investigator determine accuracy reliability evaporimetry measure Beta-adrenergic induce sweat subject range CFTR channel activity .</detailed_description>
