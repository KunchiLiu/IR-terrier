	<brief_summary>Computerized Mental Arithmetic Task Based Human Stress Level Detection Using Physiological Signal The objective study induce measure human stress level computerize mental arithmetic task multiple physiological signal ( ECG , EMG , GSR , skin temperature ) . Studies suggest mental arithmetic task one efficient stimulus induce stress . Hence , mental arithmetic task protocol improve computerized version . The protocol test normal subject multiple physiological signal acquire simultaneously . The questionnaire subject experience obtain order strengthen stress induction . The normal volunteer subject invite participation study . The physiological signal analyze use suitable algorithm base characteristic signal . The multiple signal base stress level assessment system develop train test acquire data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mental arithmetic task ( MAT ) frequently use stressor induce ass stress efficiently . However , method standardize today , due different environmental psychological factor experimental condition . Different protocol design use various stress assessment study elaborate Previous protocol detail use MAT base stress induction ( Lundberg &amp; Melin , 1994 ) 62 subject &amp; SBP ( Systolic Blood Pressure ) , DBP ( Diastolic Blood Pressure ) , Heart rate EMG . - A series addition subtraction 1 digit number . - Subject pronounces answer error recorder tape recorder . - Soft music play relax subject physiological psychological parameter measure . ( Ushiyama , et al. , 1991 ) 26 subject , blood sample , BP ECG . Initially , 20 minute relaxation - 7 subtraction 700 within 2.5 min relaxation . Finally 3 minute relaxation . - ECG continuous measure complete duration - Blood sample , blood pressure discrete variable task . ( Tomaka , Blascovich , &amp; Swart , 1994b ) 41 subject &amp; heart rate , skin conductance response ( SCR ) , stroke volume ( SV ) , SBP DBP - Mental arithmetic task two type , silent phase , aloud phase . - Initially , 10 minute rest electrode placement 4 minute relaxation electrode placement calibration . - Type1 , rapid serial addition 13 2549 . Duration 4 minute 5 minute final relaxation . - Type 2 , rapid serial subtraction 7 2549 . Duration 4 minute 5 minute final relaxation . - The subject vocalize answer loud phase silent phase subject silent perform task . ( Ring , Drayson , Walkey , Dale , &amp; Carroll , 2002 ) 24 subject &amp; SBP , DBP pulse rate . - 4 seven minute series addition presentation rate 3.5 , 3.0 , 2.5 2.0s respectively . - Addition two sequentially present single digit number ( from1 9 ) audio . - Answers retain memory next addition present audio tape recorder . - SBP , DBP pulse rate discrete variable take certain interval time . ( Linden , 1991 ) 61 subject &amp; DBP , SBP heart rate . - Four different kind noise distraction MAT . Subtraction 2000 6,7 , 8,9 consecutively , calculation time 5 Sec per one step . - Verbally pronounce answer . - No noise task ( task perform without noise ) . - Variable real life noise ( siren , car engine warm , thunder get close , background noise train station etc. , ) . - Steady real life noise ( coffee bar shop background noise ) . - Variable meaningless noise task ( white pink noise ) . ( Von Dawans , Kirschbaum , &amp; Heinrichs , 2010 ) 25 subject &amp; ECG - Mental arithmetic task ( serial subtraction ) 8 min . - The task perform stress inducing task . ( Seraganian , Szabo , Brown , &amp; Behavior , 1997 ) 20 subject &amp; ECG . - 11 problem require two serial arithmetic operation integer ( e.g. , 14* 6-17 ) . - Subject perform arithmetic also rate difficulty level 10 point scale . - Task present tape recorder counter balance order - Heart rate continue measure . Protocol design information In work , MAT design induce increase stress level one level another create increase mental demand easy hard . Here , mental arithmetic task design audio distraction reduce cognition mental demand load . This continuous exposure reason induce stress participant . The protocol consist 4 different level relaxation soft music , low level ( low difficulty ) , medium level ( medium difficulty ) , high level ( high difficulty ) . Each level 30 arithmetic problem addition , subtraction , multiplication division combination . Complexities problem level design accord low , medium , high . 10 randomly select real time noise ( generator , siren , motor sound etc ) add every 10 problem level order reduce concentration increase mental demand . According data collection environment , noise calibrate control . Physiological measure Non-intrusive measurement Electrocardiogram Electromyogram Galvanic skin response Skin temperature Electroencephalogram Subject information Normal subject open invitation give select volunteer</detailed_description>
