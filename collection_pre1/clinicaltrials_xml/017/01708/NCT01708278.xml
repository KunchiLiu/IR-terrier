	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) progressive disorder lung parenchyma airway , third-leading cause death USA . Current therapies COPD partially effective may also side effect . Although increase evidence indicate quercetin supplementation may beneficial treat COPD , key methodological issue resolve . The overall objective study determine dosage quercetin supplementation , bioavailability quercetin , safety , dose-response relationship appropriate biomarkers reflect clinical outcome patient COPD necessary conduct large clinical trial patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In preclinical study , demonstrate 4 fold increase plasma quercetin level significantly decrease lung inflammation prevent progression . Clinical study healthy volunteer 4 fold increase plasma quercetin level ( 0.22 1 ÂµM ) could achieve supplement 500mg quercetin/day . However , safety quercetin supplementation quercetin dose require achieve 4 fold increase plasma quercetin level 'at-high-risk ' COPD population yet establish . This study involve two phase ; first phase examines safety quercetin supplementation subject chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) second phase determines efficacy quercetin COPD patient . In study , enroll COPD patient mild moderate disease age group 40 65 year . During first phase , enroll total 9 patient examine tolerance safety three dos quercetin ( 500 , 1000 2000 mg/day ) dose escalation manner . First cohort consist three subject receive placebo 500 mg quercetin per day one week safety quercetin supplementation assess monitoring adverse event change outcomes blood test include complete blood count ( CBC ) comprehensive metabolic panel prior supplementation . If dose safe tolerate , second cohort 3 subject receive placebo 1000 mg quercetin per day quercetin one week safety assess . If dose safely tolerate , third cohort receive either placebo 2000 mg quercetin per day week safety assess . Having complete Phase I study University Michigan , plan Phase II efficacy study separate NCT number . As 2016 phase II study begin . Based initial study , plan choose high quercetin dose tolerate adverse event dose ( 500 mg quercetin per day ) find increase plasma quercetin level 4 fold baseline healthy volunteer examine efficacy quercetin reduce inflammatory oxidative stress marker improve lung function COPD subject . In second phase , enroll total 75 subject randomize three arm ; placebo ( 15 subject ) one two dos quercetin ( 30 subject per arm ) . All enrolled subject ask avoid quercetin rich food throughout study period . One week enrollment ( run-in ) , subject either supplement either placebo one two dos quercetin 4 week . All participant blind study agent . Plasma sputum quercetin level , lung function , marker oxidative stress inflammation determine start study ( follow run-in period ) , end 4 week treatment period . Three original outcome measure list related follow study 4 week treatment never begin . Therefore delete .</detailed_description>
