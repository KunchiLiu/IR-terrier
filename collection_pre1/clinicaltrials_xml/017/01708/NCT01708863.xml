	<brief_summary>Hypoplastic leave heart syndrome ( HLHS ) severe form congenital heart disease consist multiple obstruction flow leave heart aorta , well hypoplasia leave ventricle . Most patient require three-stage surgical protocol start within day birth . Stage I process Norwood reconstruction ( within first day life ) , Stage II ( usually require within 3-8 month ) involve creation direct connection patient 's superior vena cava pulmonary arterial confluence ( bidirectional Glenn anastomosis ) , last stage creation Fontan circulation ( typically within first 2-4 year ) . This `` single ventricle '' approach require right ventricle perform circulatory pump entire body . Our long-term goal develop regenerative strategy strengthen augment right ventricular muscle single-ventricle heart follow surgical palliation HLHS patient . To determine safety feasibility cell-based therapeutic intervention Stage II surgery , aim document natural history post-surgical care HLHS patient undergone standard care protocol specific follow-up course 6-month period . This prospective study document natural history patient HLHS plan Stage II surgical palliation focus cardiovascular parameter within 6 month follow surgery 10-20 patient .</brief_summary>
