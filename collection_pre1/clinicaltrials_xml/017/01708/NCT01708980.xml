	<brief_summary>Background : In early phase total knee replacement ( TKA ) , patient experience multi-level weakness operate leg , cause primarily reduce central ( CNS ) activation failure muscle - especially knee extensor . This considerable loss muscle strength relate reduced functional performance . The investigator recently report early-commenced physiotherapy , include progressive strength training perform machine , seem feasible TKA . The question , neuromuscular activity muscle operate leg , elicit strength training machine , reach strength training simple form ? Many clinician face problem strength training equipment institution , prescribe simple strength training exercise home-based training . Purpose hypothesis : The purpose study determine strength training exercise activate muscle operate leg TKA . The hypothesis strength training exercise perform machine effective compare strength training perform simple form ( use elastic band body weight , etc. ) . Participants method : Twenty participant unilateral TKA , operate 4 8 week prior first investigation , include . The participant investigate twice . During first investigation , absolute load ( kilogram ) correspond 10 Repetition Maximum ( RM ) ( load lift exactly 10 time ) determine exercise . At least 72 hour later , participant undergo electromyographic analysis , determine neuromuscular activity thigh muscle operate leg . Ethical issue : From pilot study , investigator find strength training exercise commence early TKA seem feasible exercise increase knee joint swell knee pain . None financial supporter , author , potential conflict interest regard study .</brief_summary>
