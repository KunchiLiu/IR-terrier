	<detailed_description>Background - Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) incidence increase alarm rate Hong Kong . A recent World Cancer Research Fund ( WCRF ) report conclude physical activity ( PA ) protect colon cancer food low dietary fibre , red meat process meat cause CRC . Yet , influence lifestyle factor cancer outcome ( i.e . recurrence survival rate ) CRC survivor largely unknown . Our literature review show paucity publish study lifestyle intervention CRC survivor ; none investigate effect intervention cancer outcome . With advance treatment , CRC survivor live longer . Many motivate make lifestyle change . However , qualitative research show huge service gap provision appropriate PA dietary advice CRC survivor . Many patient unaware link PA diet CRC outcome demonstrate acceptance lifestyle intervention . Yet , currently scientifically-based evidence allow firm recommendation make . Objectives &amp; hypothesis - Our study aim evaluate acceptability two behavioural intervention CRC survivor intend improve cancer outcome design ( 1 ) increase PA level ( 60 minute moderate PA 5 days/week ) ( 2 ) reduce consumption Western diet ( &lt; 5 serving red/processed meat weekly 2 serving refine grain daily ) . We hypothesize propose intervention ( 1 ) efficacious change two targeted behaviour ; ( 2 ) acceptable CRC survivor compliance rate 80 % . Settings method - The study follow Medical Research Council Framework design evaluation complex intervention . Phases 0 1 ( funded WCRF ) complete . This application seek fund Phase 2 feasibility trial . Two hundred twenty-four CRC survivor within 12 month completion cancer treatment without evidence persistent/recurrent disease recruit four public hospital Hong Kong inform consent . Subjects randomize 2x2 factorial design two targeted behaviour prescribe 12 month . Primary outcome measure whether target level PA dietary intake could meet end intervention . Secondary outcome measure include : ( 1 ) magnitude change PA level dietary intake ; ( 2 ) rate determinant compliance questionnaire ; ( 3 ) facilitator barrier behavioural change questionnaire ; ( 4 ) measurement theoretical construct underlie PA dietary intervention questionnaire ; ( 5 ) possible health benefit ( body composition , physical fitness , quality life mood ) side effect ( PA-associated injury nutritional deficiency ) arise intervention . Outcome assess baseline , 6 month intervention 0 , 6 12 month post-intervention ( i.e . baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month start intervention ) . Impact - To best knowledge , first behavioural intervention model target PA reduce consumption Western diet CRC survivor . If prove feasible , intervention programme would pave way large randomize controlled trial test effect PA diet treatment outcome CRC .</detailed_description>
