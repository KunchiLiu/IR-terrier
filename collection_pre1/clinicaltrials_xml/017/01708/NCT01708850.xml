	<brief_summary>Patients cancer upper extremity DVT associate central venous catheter ( CVC ) receive rivaroxaban . CVC survival assess compare previous rate low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) warfarin , along secondary safety outcome include bleed recurrent venous thromboembolism . The investigator hypothesize anticoagulation rivaroxaban patient UEDVT secondary central venous catheter patient active malignancy effective therapy quantify success catheter preservation . Prolonged line salvage rate without recurrence UEDVT improve management cancer patient develop upper extremity deep venous thrombosis set central venous catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Cancer Patients With Central Line Associated Clots Upper Extremity Treated With Rivaroxaban ( Catheter 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study patient present acute upper limb thrombosis set central venous catheter . The total study duration 12 week , one follow telephone visit 6 month . All patient treat rivaroxaban dose 15 mg orally twice daily three week , follow 20 mg daily . Anticoagulation continue three month regardless length time catheter place . Continuation anticoagulation beyond time period discretion investigator . Strengths study include prospective cohort format , access large oncologic population London Regional Cancer Program corresponding centre . In addition , The Catheter Study look CVC survival safety patient cancer diagnose UEDVT treat bridge protocol warfarin/dalteparin organize primarily LHSc result therein could directly compare result study give similar patient population . Limitations study include small sample size fact LMWH monotherapy comparison group . In addition , open study blinding , give nature line survival . There also chance proportion patient catheter remove reason , finish treatment personal preference , could affect validity survival result . This design select give small number patient present diagnosis year centre , would present difficulty accrue enough patient several comparison group . Results compare Catheter Study previous literature .</detailed_description>
