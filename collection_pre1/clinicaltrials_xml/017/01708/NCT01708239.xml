	<detailed_description>In pregnant woman suspect DVT , sure diagnosis mandatory . Indeed , false positive test lead inappropriate anticoagulant treatment , increase risk bleeding . Conversely , false negative test might lead life-threatening thromboembolic event . Thus , accuracy diagnostic method use pregnant woman crucial [ 1 ] . In non-pregnant patient , sequential diagnostic strategy base 1 ) assessment clinical probability , 2 ) D-dimer measurement 3 ) compression ultrasonography ( CUS ) widely validate [ 2 , 3 ] . Clinical probability assessment clinical prediction rule ( CPRs ) crucial step management suspect DVT . However , commonly use CPR DVT , Wells ' score , never validate pregnant woman [ 3 ] . Recently , 'LEFt ' clinical prediction rule derive internally validate Chan et al . among 194 pregnant woman investigate suspected DVT [ 4 ] . This rule combine three variable : symptom leave leg ( `` L '' ) , calf circumference difference equal great 2 centimeter ( `` E '' edema ) first trim presentation ( `` Ft '' ) [ 4 ] . We perform external validation rule recently publish prospective cohort pregnant patient suspect DVT ( submit JTH ) . This external validation show negative `` LEFt '' rule accurately identify pregnant woman proportion confirm DVT appear low . A prospective validation rule warrant , plan use prospective study . The second step use diagnostic strategy include non-pregnant patient D-dimer measurement . The test widely validate non-pregnant patient , association non-high clinical probability , allow safely rule DVT [ 5 ] . As D-dimer level raise steadily pregnancy , specificity test decrease less useful pregnant woman . A recent study suggest currently available sensitive D-dimer assay use exclusion symptomatic non-pregnant woman potential exclude DVT symptomatic pregnant woman application high cut-points [ 6 ] . Even data arises small study , clearly suggest usual cut-off set 500 ng/ml would safely rule DVT pregnant woman [ 6 ] . As usual cut-off never prospectively validated pregnant woman suspect DVT , would like , first step , use study . In pregnant patient , limited data available use complete compression ultrasonography rule DVT . In recent prospective management study , include 226 pregnant post-partum woman suspect low limb DVT . We observe 1.1 % ( 95 % CI:0.3-4.0 ) three-month thromboembolic event rate leave untreated basis negative single complete CUS [ 7 ] . This result line report normal phlebography , gold standard test [ 8 ] . Even complete CUS safe rule DVT pregnant woman , current diagnostic strategy suspect DVT non-pregnant patient rely use clinical probability D-Dimer prior leg vein image [ 5 ] . However , management outcome study safety usefulness D-Dimer rule DVT pregnant woman available date . Another limitation strategy base single unique complete CUS , every woman undergo complete CUS . However , test always available . Therefore , strategy association clinical probability assessment D-dimer measurement would allow safely rule DVT significant proportion patient without perform complete CUS , would great help everyday clinical practice would probably cost-effective . Therefore , plan prospective study ass safety sequential diagnostic strategy base assessment clinical probability LEFt rule , D-dimer measurement complete CUS pregnant woman suspect DVT .</detailed_description>
