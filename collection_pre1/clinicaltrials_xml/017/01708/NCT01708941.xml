	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well ipilimumab without high-dose recombinant interferon alpha-2b work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , may block tumor growth target certain cell . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth tumor cell . It yet know whether ipilimumab effective without high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2b treating melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With Without High-Dose Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test hypothesis combination ipilimumab high-dose interferon-alpha 2b ( HDI [ recombinant interferon alfa-2b ] ) improve progression free survival ( PFS ) patient advance metastatic melanoma compare ipilimumab alone ( across ipilimumab treatment status ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test hypothesis combination ipilimumab HDI prove safe tolerable . II . Within constraint sample size , attempt test hypothesis ( 1 ) ipilimumab 10 mg/kg lead improve PFS comparison ipilimumab 3 mg/kg ( across HDI treatment status ) ; ( 2 ) combination ipilimumab HDI improve overall survival ( OS ) patient advance metastatic melanoma compare ipilimumab alone ( across ipilimumab treatment status ) ( 3 ) ipilimumab 10 mg/kg lead improve OS comparison ipilimumab 3 mg/kg ( across HDI treatment status ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM A : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive high dose ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV 20 minute 5 day week 4 week subcutaneously ( SC ) 3 time weekly 8 week . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive high dose ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 12 week 4 dos begin week 24 recombinant interferon alfa-2b SC 3 time weekly 48 week . ARM B : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive high dose ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive high dose ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 12 week 4 dos begin week 24 . ARM C : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive low dose ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV 20 minute 5 day week 4 week SC 3 time weekly 8 week . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive low dose ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 12 week 4 dos begin week 24 recombinant interferon alfa-2b SC 3 time weekly 48 week . ARM D : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive low dose ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive low dose ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 12 week 4 dos begin week 24 . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
