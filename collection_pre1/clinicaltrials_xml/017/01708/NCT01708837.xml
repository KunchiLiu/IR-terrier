	<brief_title>Effect Depth Total Intravenous Anesthesia Using Propofol Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION 1.1 Rationale study There significant relation postoperative cognitive dysfunction increase age , increase duration surgery . But , , effect depth anesthesia POCD remain controversial . This study design investigate whether depth anesthesia affect incidence POCD , use propofol total intravenous anesthesia elderly patient whose depth anesthesia monitor adjust bispectral index ( BIS ) . The early long-term incidence POCD compare deep light-anesthesia group . 1.2 Background We hypothesize depth anesthesia may exert influence early postoperative cognitive dysfunction . One reason deep anesthesia might protect cognitive function prevention stress response noxious stimulation . The noxious stimulation surgery induce stress response whose severity correlate intensity surgery ( major versus minor ) .Light anesthesia serious stress response noxious stimulation may increase incidence POCD . Furthermore , major surgery cause serious stress response give rise high incidence early postoperative cognitive dysfunction minor . This may also prove hypothesis hand . The elderly patient receive major surgery high incidence early POCD receive minor surgery . A deleterious stress response associate major surgery light anesthesia , cause excessive production corticosteroid target receptor cerebral cortex subcortical nucleus , eventually result neuron injury . This may explain elderly high incidence early POCD surgery . However , effect depth anesthesia POCD remain controversial . Farag E et al . randomize 74 patient either low Bispectral Index ( BIS ) regimen high BIS regimen surgical procedure . Preoperatively 4-6 week surgery , patient ' cognitive status assess cognitive test battery consist process speed index , work memory index , verbal memory index . Processing speed index high low BIS group versus high BIS group . But difference observe two test battery component . Certainly one limitation data observed difference cognitive ability occur one three assessment . Recently , make randomise , double-blind , control study demonstrate deeper general anesthesia , define median BIS 38 , compare median BIS 58 , associate reduce incidence early POCD ( 1 week postoperationly ) . This study publish J Neurosurg Anesthesiol , Volume 23 , Number 1 , January 2011. small sample ( n=40 ) study without consider incidence long-term POCD , hope obtain reliable data multi-center study investigate whether depth total intravenous anesthesia use propofol affect early long-term incidence POCD . The bispectral index（BIS）can reflect depth anesthesia propofol combine opioids . In study , BIS still use provide reference selection suitable depth anesthesia .</detailed_description>
