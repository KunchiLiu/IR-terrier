	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give erlotinib hydrochloride cabozantinib-s-malate alone combination work second third line therapy treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride cabozantinib-s-malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give erlotinib hydrochloride together cabozantinib-s-malate effective erlotinib hydrochloride cabozantinib-s-malate alone treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Cabozantinib-s-Malate Alone Combination Second Third Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) associate patient treat erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) versus ( v ) erlotinib plus cabozantinib ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) . II . To compare PFS associated patient treat erlotinib v cabozantinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival three treatment arm . II . To evaluate best objective response rate three treatment arm . III . To define toxicity associate regimen . IV . To conduct correlative science study help select predictive biomarkers response therapy , include mesenchymal-epidermal transition ( MET ) expression potentially tissue biomarkers , plasma biomarkers , bone scan . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A ( erlotinib ) : Patients receive erlotinib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B ( cabozantinib ) : Patients receive cabozantinib PO daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C ( erlotinib+cabozantinib ) : Patients receive erlotinib patient Arm A cabozantinib patient Arm B . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM Z : Patients achieve disease progression Arm A Arm B may receive erlotinib cabozantinib patient Arm C. Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
