	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate feasibility new wearable computerised system design ongoing monitor sportsman real-life condition . This system consist different sensor Bluetooth Transmitters interconnect wire integrate textile T-shirt . Several physiologic parameter include bioimpedance investigate condition relevant intensive physical activity , like high body temperature partial dehydration . This system test laboratory `` natural/open air '' condition , obtain evaluation compare standardise establish diagnostic method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The new wearable sensor- monitoring system test 20 healthy sportsman gender age 18 35 year . The aim present study characterisation technical parameter , diagnostic precision practical applicability system , able measure translate information actual physiologic state physical activity sportsman real-life condition . IPANEMA ( Integrated Posture Activity Network ) construct consist electrode several specialized sensor integrate textile tissue T-Shirt interconnect `` electronic nod '' , equipment support central computerize control system information via Bluetooth signal . This body sensor network enables ablation electrical activity heart ( ECG ) , Bioimpedance Spectroscopy ( BIS ) , measure temperature humidity surface skin , breathe intensity acceleration body movement . The study divide 3 part , indoor part , outdoor part , part measurement control artificial temperature condition ( climate chamber ) . The outdoor measurement perform different run track , e.g . Hochschulsportzentrum , Lousberg , separate two subtypes , train competition . The indoor study phase last ca . 2 hour , volunteer analyse run tread mill , IPANEMA system common medical monitoring procedure . The evaluation identical physiological parameter obtain use stationary diagnostic equipment , ergospirometric device PowerCube Ergo , BIS measurement system Xitron Hydra 4200 , infra-red camera VarioCam®hr-basic standard medical ECG measurement use reference value . Two hour start entire training phase , experimental group restrict food liquid intake opposite control group . These experimental condition purpose clarify several physiological effect dehydration sportive activity . The outdoor- climate chamber- investigation prescribe liquid deprivation . The climate chamber measurement perform temperature control room . This measurement session last 3 hour temperature inside climate chamber increase 40Cº . Such condition may simulate body sensor network elicit physiological effect comparable effect obtain sportive activity . No sport perform volunteer climate chamber phase .</detailed_description>
