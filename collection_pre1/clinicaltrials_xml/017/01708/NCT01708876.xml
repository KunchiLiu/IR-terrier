	<brief_summary>Preliminary study support background efficacy local standard anti-malarial medication treatment uncomplicated knowlesi malaria , however test systematically current WHO treatment guideline infection . There health cost benefit rapidly act agent , due difficulty microscopic identification may effective treatment malaria specie align treatment guideline could support . In addition , therapeutic efficacy monitor current first line anti-malarials use treatment P. vivax malaria conduct Malaysia . The investigator aim test whether fixed combination artesunate-mefloquine superior chloroquine order define optimal treatment uncomplicated P. knowlesi P. vivax infection adult child region .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.1 Background Naturally acquire infection Plasmodium knowlesi , fifth human malaria , grow [ 1 ] . Since 2004 increase number case report resident return traveler predominantly Malaysia country South-East Asia include Thailand , Vietnam , Myanmar , Singapore , Indonesia Philippines [ 2-8 ] . Cases coincide geographic distribution natural simian host ( long-tailed pig-tailed macaque ) Anopheles leucosphyrus group mosquito vector [ 9 , 10 ] , potential human-to-human transmission unknown . Eastern Malaysia appear epicentre , around 1400 PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi human mono-infections report 2009 , comprise 41 % 2,189 total malaria case Sarawak [ 11 ] 343 case select sample send Sabah 's State Reference Laboratory [ 12 ] . P. knowlesi also common cause malaria different contrast region , include 70 % malaria admission heavily forest area Kapit Sarawak [ 1 , 13 ] , 63 % sample interior division Sabah [ 14 ] , 87 % malaria admission deforest coastal area Kudat Sabah , also major cause malaria child [ 15 ] . Despite increase report incidence , difficulty microscopic diagnosis lack PCR base epidemiological surveillance study throughout South-East Asia mean true disease burden underestimated . P. knowlesi microscopically misidentified P . falciparum P. malariae due morphological similarity early trophozoite , late trophozoite schizont life stage respectively , study show 80 % P. malariae [ 16-19 ] 7-12 % P. falciparum [ 1 , 16 ] region actually P. knowlesi definitively evaluate PCR . Current rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) malaria distinguish falciparum Current rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) malaria distinguish falciparum Plasmodium species sensitivity 99 % parasite count &gt; 1,000/ μL [ 20 ] , knowlesi specific antigen develop current antibody panel unable differentiate P. knowlesi mixed Plasmodium spp . infection [ 21 ] . Misdiagnosis concern treatment implication , unlike P. malariae , knowlesi malaria rapid 24-hour replication rate cause hyperparasitaemia , severe complication fatal outcome [ 13 , 17 , 18 ] , inadvertent use chloroquine widely chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum may also fatal consequence . 1.2 Treatment Initial observational retrospective study suggest chloroquine artemisinin combination therapy ( ACT ) effective therapy uncomplicated P. knowlesi infection [ 15 , 16 , 22 , 23 ] . Justification treatment selection trial base literature review . Case report predominantly return traveler South-East Asia also document uncomplicated knowlesi malaria respond well conventional anti-malarials chloroquine , mefloquine , atovaquone proguanil , doxycycline quinine [ 4 , 24- 31 ] , support zoonotic drug naïve origin . However date prospective randomise trial compare chloroquine ACT anti-malarials currently use uncomplicated P. knowlesi infection Malaysia , current recommendation treat P. knowlesi infection WHO 2010 malaria treatment guideline . As ACTs already use treat P. falciparum recommend increasingly chloroquine-resistant P. vivax find surround country South East Asia [ 32 ] , potential benefit unified treatment policy facilitate prompt effective treatment Plasmodium species need evidence ACT optimal treatment P. knowlesi infection also . Malaysian Ministry Health guideline currently recommend chloroquine primaquine first line treatment erythrocytic hypnozoite life stage uncomplicated P. vivax malaria respectively . While resistance chloroquine previously document Sabah [ 35 ] Peninsular Malaysia [ 36-38 ] , unstable transmission dynamic recent reduction P. vivax incidence due public health measure mean current risk chloroquine-resistant P.vivax transmission likely low . Despite , due increase resistance surround country include Indonesia , Thailand , Vietnam , PNG [ 39 ] , transient population migrant worker , recent concern fail efficacy hypnozoite eradication primaquine [ 40 ] , need ongoing therapeutic efficacy monitoring recommend [ 41 ] . 1.3 Artesunate-mefloquine Artesunate-mefloquine ( AS-MQ ) common widely available ACT , along artemether-lumefantrine ( A-L ) one 2 first line WHO recommend option treatment uncomplicated P. falciparum infection register Malaysia produce accord international good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) standard . ACTs current mainstay malaria elimination effort [ 33 ] , mechanism action result rapid reduction parasite mass resolution clinical feature , long act component eliminate residual parasite delay development de novo resistance [ 34 , 35 ] . Safety tolerability ACTs dependent partner drug [ 36 ] , gastro-intestinal self-limiting neuro-psychiatric adverse event report mefloquine , multiple safety efficacy trial recommend use adult child uncomplicated falciparum malaria [ 37-40 ] . Due concern safety mefloquine first trim pregnancy [ 41 ] , use patient pre-existing psychiatric disorder previously cerebral malaria , currently advise group [ 36 ] . The report use ACT knowlesi malaria retrospective study tertiary referral hospital Sabah , small sample size 8 34 patient PCR- confirm uncomplicated P. knowlesi infection treat oral artemether- lumefantrine . Median microscopic parasite clearance time 1 day ( range 0-3 ) , significantly faster receive chloroquine ( median 2.5 day , range 1-3 , p = 0.01 ) [ 23 ] . There publish report ACTs use treatment P. knowlesi infection , although currently AS-MQ A-L use Sabah uncomplicated P. knowlesi P. falciparum malaria , include child &gt; 5kg , recommend local guideline . Mefloquine single agent also use successful treatment Swedish traveller return Sarawak , Malaysia PCR confirm uncomplicated P. knowlesi infection 2009 [ 24 ] . The long half life mefloquine around 14 day also mean used partner drug ACT uncomplicated malaria cause Plasmodium specie P. vivax , significant reduction compare A-L day 42 treatment failure rate [ 42 ] . 1.4 Chloroquine Chloroquine primaquine initially suggest favourable treatment outcomes uncomplicated P. knowlesi human infection retrospective review patient Kapit Hospital Sarawak 2004 [ 16 ] . Following single prospective observational study conduct site 2006-7 administer chloroquine total base dose 25mg/kg primaquine gametocidal agent 73 patient uncomplicated PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi malaria , result show median fever clearance 26 hour , mean time 50 % 90 % microscopic parasite clearance 3.1 10.3 hour respectively , median PCR adjust clearance time 3 day . None 60 patient complete 28-day follow demonstrate evidence resistance , re-infection recrudescence [ 22 ] .</detailed_description>
