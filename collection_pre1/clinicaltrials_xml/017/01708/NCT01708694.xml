	<brief_title>Role Slowly Digesible Starch Diabetes Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In double blind randomize controlled clinical trial , investigator test effect slowly digest starch ( amylose ) versus placebo starch ( amylopectin ) risk factor type 2 diabetes . For study , 95 obese participant ( age 35-65 ) pre-diabetes ( impaired fasting glucose ) consume yogurt contain 45 g either experimental placebo starch daily 3 month . The investigator test hypothesis , compare control , daily intake 45 g amylose 3 month improve risk factor development type 2 diabetes ( insulin sensitivity secretion ) decrease ectopic fat depot decrease inflammation parallel change colonic microbial population .</detailed_description>
