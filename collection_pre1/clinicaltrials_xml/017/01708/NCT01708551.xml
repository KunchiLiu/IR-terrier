	<brief_summary>Up 60 subject enrol one five treatment group . Subjects enrol Groups A , B C undergo axillary punch biopsy course trial determine number depth sweat gland , receive dual depth treatment ( 4.5mm 3.0mm ) ; either two bilateral Ultherapy™ treatment axillas 30 day apart ( Groups A B ) one bilateral Ultherapy™ treatment ( Group C ) . Subjects Groups D E receive two bilateral Ultherapy™ treatment axillas 30 day apart 2.0mm treatment depth two different energy setting ( Group D 0.45 J , Group E 0.30 J ) . Protocol amend ( Sept 2014 ) : Subjects Groups D E receive treatment energy setting ( 0.30J ) two treatment density : Group D , 60 lines/treatment square ; Group E , 40 line per treatment square .

	<brief_title>Histological Analysis Following Ulthera System Treatment Hyperhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , single-center , non-randomized pilot clinical trial . Subjects enrol include : - naïve Ultherapy™ treatment hyperhidrosis ( Group A , n=31 ) ; dual-depth treatment 4.5mm 3.0mm ; - non-responders prior Ultherapy™ treatment hyperhidrosis ( Group B , n=approx 5 ) , dual-depth treatment 4.5mm 3.0mm ; - naïve Ultherapy™ treatment hyperhidrosis receive one double-density study treatment ( Group C , n=4 ) , dual-depth treatment 4.5mm 3.0mm ; - naïve Ultherapy™ treatment hyperhidrosis ( Group D , n=10 ) , single-depth treatment 2.0mm standard energy ; - naïve Ultherapy™ treatment hyperhidrosis ( Group E , n=10 ) , single-depth treatment 2.0mm adjust energy . - Protocol amend ( Sept 2014 ) : Subjects Groups D E receive treatment energy setting ( 0.30J ) two treatment density : Group D , 60 lines/treatment square ; Group E , 40 line per treatment square . Ultrasound image capture axilla assess dermal thickness depth sweat gland . A gravimetric measurement sweat production starch iodine test perform prior treatment . Digital image starch iodine test obtain . Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale ( HDSS ) score obtain prior treatment . During treatment , average Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) score obtain axilla treat . Efficacy determine reduction number sweat gland baseline 90-days post-treatment , evidence histological analysis . Subject Gravimetric result , Starch iodine result , HDSS score follow-up compare baseline also analyze secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
