	<brief_summary>Introduction : Cycling currently promote municipal , provincial national level form active transportation increase physical activity time reduce traffic congestion , traffic-related air pollution greenhouse gas emission . While population level health benefit exercise via cycling estimate substantially exceed health impact relate air pollution exposure injury traffic accident , cyclist know experience elevate exposure traffic-related air pollutant . Combined exposure elevate concentration air pollutant , cyclist also subject substantially increase inhaled dos due level exertion consequently increase inhalation rate . Therefore , give cyclist experience exposure relatively high concentration traffic-related air pollutant inhalation pollutant increase , important evaluate potential health impact scenario . Research potential health impact relate exercise ( cycle ) urban air pollution exposure help inform public communication strategy relate air quality health impact . In addition , previous work suggest substantial variability air pollution exposure cyclist related route type level traffic along cycling route , potential transportation planner promote increase cycling enhance infrastructure time develop route also minimize exposure air pollution . The cyclist population also interested information regard air pollution exposures potential health impact relate cycling . The objective study investigate relationship traffic-related air pollution exposure , respiratory cardiovascular health impact commute cyclist . Specifically , investigator propose : 1. determine commute cyclist ' exposure traffic-related air pollutant ( PM 2.5 , PM10 , ultrafine particulate , black carbon ) cycling along two different bicycle route city Vancouver ; 2. estimate pollutant dose receive cyclist , relate health effect observe ; 3. determine change lung function , endothelial function , C-reactive protein level relate level air pollution exposure dose</brief_summary>
