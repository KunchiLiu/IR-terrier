	<brief_summary>This open-label , randomize , single-dose , 2-treatment , 2-period , 2-way crossover study incomplete wash-out subject solid tumor determine relative bioavailability test formulation lower dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) content compare standard reference formulation trametinib . Approximately 18 subject randomize receive either single dose Treatment A ( standard target DMSO content [ theoretical 11.3 % ] formulation GSK1120212B ) single dose Treatment B ( low DMSO Content [ approximately 9.5 % ] formulation GSK1120212B ) follow 7 day incomplete wash-out period , single dose treatment . Administration dose fast condition Periods 1 2 Day 1 follow 7 day serial blood sample PK analysis plasma trametinib . Safety assessment , include assessment AEs , clinical laboratory ( hematology clinical chemistry ) vital sign , make throughout study . After subject completes study , may eligible enter study MEK114375 , open-label rollover study trametinib ( wash-out period follow-up visit require ) continue receive trametinib . For subject wish discontinue complete current study choose enter rollover study , follow-up visit perform within 21 day receive last dose study treatment .</brief_summary>
