	<brief_title>Tivantinib Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose tivantinib administer orally twice daily child refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity tivantinib administer schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics tivantinib ( capsule well powder formulation ) child refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity tivantinib within confines phase 1 study . II . To preliminarily investigate whether cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) polymorphisms impact pharmacokinetics toxicity tivantinib . III . To preliminarily investigate whether tumor c-Met and/or hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) expression downstream c-Met signal correlate clinical response tivantinib . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
