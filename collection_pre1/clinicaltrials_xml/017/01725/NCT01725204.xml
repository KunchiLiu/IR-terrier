	<brief_summary>Patients newly diagnose CML excellent outcome tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . However , patient cure TKIs alone , thus need continued life-long treatment . Some patient achieve complete molecular remission ( CMR ) , rate high second generation TKIs compare imatinib . Some experience drug discontinuation CMR derive small study , notably French STIM study . Approximately 40 % patient minimum two year MR4.5 ( 4.5 log reduction molecular response ) stop imatinib without relapse , indicate possible cure . To increase non-relapse rate major importance . To achieve permanent `` cure '' without stem cell transplantation presently relevant goal clinical study CML . The investigator hypothesize significantly increase cure rate CML , therapy eradicate leukemic stem cell and/or induce restore anti-CML immunity . Second generation TKIs may profound effect stem cell pool compare imatinib . This assessed current randomize study reduction leukemic stem cell burden primary endpoint ( NordCML006 ) . Interferon-alpha ( IFN ) prominent immunomodulatory antiproliferative mode action , also activity stem cell . Pegylated IFN combination imatinib result improve therapy response compare imatinib monotherapy . This advantage may translate high cure rate . Dasatinib unique dual mechanism action : potent available TKIs induces immunological effect different IFN . Both drug may immunological adverse-effects use monotherapy . However , immunological adverse-effects may also markers anti-leukemia efficacy . A combination dasatinib pegylated IFN ( PegIFN ) may additive synergistic effect test clinical study .</brief_summary>
