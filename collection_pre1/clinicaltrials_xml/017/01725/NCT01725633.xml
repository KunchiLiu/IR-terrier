	<brief_summary>This study do examine safety feasibility supervise progressive exercise program woman diagnose metastatic breast cancer . Previous research among woman metastatic breast cancer show treatment commonly use population may adverse impact physical fitness level lead feeling fatigue poor quality life . Supervised exercise train show reduce side-effects woman early-stage breast cancer receive common cancer treatment . However , know supervised exercise training safe feasible intervention woman metastatic breast cancer . This study design find supervised exercise training safe patient undergo treatment metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>MSK histologically confirm metastatic breast cancer Measurable disease ( nonmeasurable boneonly disease ) assess CT PET/CT perform part standard care , discretion attend oncologist Breast Medicine Service ≥18 year age ; Life expectancy &gt; 3 month ; ECOG ≤ 1 Sedentary , per leisure score index ( LSI ) Godin LeisureTime Exercise Questionnaire ( GLTEQ ) . Participants perform regular moderate vigorous intensity exercise least 5 days/week , least 30 minutes/session , eligible Able achieve acceptable peak baseline CPET , define follow criterion : 1 . Achieving plateau oxygen consumption , concurrent increase power output ; 2 . A respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10 ; 3 . Attainment maximal predict heart rate ( HRmax ) ( i.e. , within 10 bpm agepredicted HRmax [ HRmax = 220Age [ year ] ) ; 4 . Volitional exhaustion , measure rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) ≥ 18 BORG scale Normal cardiac function ( left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50 % ) ; Medical clearance attend oncologist indicate relative contraindication undergo symptomlimited cardiopulmonary exercise test aerobic training intervention ; Patients `` treated stable '' brain lesion duration ≥ 2 month may enrol Willing randomized one study arm Female Any follow absolute contraindication cardiopulmonary exercise testing : 1 . Acute myocardial infarction within 35 day plan study procedures 2 . Unstable angina 3 . Uncontrolled arrhythmia cause symptom hemodynamic compromise ; 4 . Recurrent syncope 5 . Active endocarditis ; 6 . Acute myocarditis pericarditis 7 . Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis 8 . Uncontrolled heart failure 9 . Acute pulmonary embolus pulmonary infarction within 3 month plan study procedures 10 . Thrombosis low extremity 11 . Suspected dissect aneurysm 12 . Uncontrolled asthma 13 . Pulmonary edema 14 . Room air desaturation rest ≤ 85 % 15 . Respiratory failure 16 . Acute noncardiopulmonary disorder may affect exercise performance aggravate exercise ( i.e. , infection , renal failure , thyrotoxicosis ) 17 . Mental impairment lead inability cooperate . Any condition intercurrent illness , opinion investigator , make participant poor candidate trial Presence extensive skeletal metastasis , define five ( 5 ) sit bony disease , symptomatic site disease spine , hip , femur .
