	<brief_summary>This dose escalation/dose finding , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel study GSK2126458 subject IPF . The study design explore number dos GSK2126458 engagement pharmacology short term dose . It anticipate approximately 24 subject enrol study . Actual number cohort study could vary maximum 6 cohort ( n=4/cohort ; 3 active 1 placebo ) . Each cohort consist four subject randomise receive GSK2126458 ( three subject ) placebo ( one subject ) approximately 8 day ( 7 10 day ) . On Day 1 receive first dose GSK2126458 ( placebo ) safety , tolerability PK/PD blood measure 8 hour post-dose . Subjects discharge site study drug last day dose . They also receive hand hold spirometer instruction action take case deterioration pulmonary function adverse event ( AEs ) . On last day dose return site repeat Day 1 procedure . A bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) [ 18F ] -fluoro-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) - positron emission tomography / compute tomography ( PET/CT ) scan conduct twice study ; , least 2 day dose commences course dose period . After final subject cohort complete dosing , dose escalation meeting take place . Safety tolerability PK data review meeting decision make may include limited : escalate dose , decrease dose repeat dose next cohort ; stop study .</brief_summary>
