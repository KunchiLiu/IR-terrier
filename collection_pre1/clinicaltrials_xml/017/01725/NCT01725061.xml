	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) often deadly form respiratory failure cause inflammation . The widespread injury lung involve build-up fluid lung result damage lung decrease ability lung function properly . There currently specific treatment ALI ; 200,000 case report US yearly , 40 % die . Some patient may condition could change risk develop ALI . For example , report patient septic shock lower chance develop ALI also diabetes mellitus ( diabetes ) . Septic shock type infection cause overwhelming inflammation occur throughout body ; increase chance person develop ALI . The reason diabetic less likely develop ALI unclear deserve investigation . The investigator believe may explain difference way certain cell involve inflammation function lung . The investigator plan look relationship wide-spread inflammation occur within body diabetic non-diabetic patient increase chance develop ALI [ sepsis ] . To study relationship , identify patient fit requirement study . The investigator obtain blood sample lung washing patient . The lung washing obtain inject clean salt water lung tube pull water back . When sterile water remove , cell lung also remove use lab study . Determining diabetes may change patient 's chance develop ALI may uncover useful information may help prevent treat ALI patient risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) common lethal form respiratory failure , occur 200,000 people year many 25 % mechanically ventilated patient . Despite multiple clinical study , presently effective medical therapy ALI , mortality remain unacceptably high 40 % . Common co-morbid condition alter susceptibility ALI chronic alcohol abuse diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . The incidence severity ALI increase critically ill patient history chronic alcohol abuse . With respect DM , group previously report history diabetes mellitus associate decreased incidence ALI patient septic shock . As biological mechanism association unknown , cross-sectional epidemiological study conduct broadly examine role diabetes development respiratory failure associate sepsis . Using national hospitalization data , find diabetic sepsis less likely develop form acute respiratory failure non-diabetics . ALI occur common pathway oxidant stress inflammation , injure lung render dysfunctional gas exchange . The alveolar macrophage ( AM ) important mediator inflammatory response , roles phagocytosis secretion inflammatory cytokine key component lung injury repair . While one mechanism may explain previous observation decrease incidence ALI diabetic , data chronic alcoholic suggest AM dysfunction may play role development ALI lead u hypothesize DM may similarly alter pulmonary microenvironment , thereby decrease susceptibility ALI . Furthermore , early preliminary data suggest AM activity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ ) , transcription factor anti-inflammatory property , may increase diabetic . In addition , evidence suggest macrophage activation pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory state may tissue specific alter obesity insulin resistance ( i.e . compartmentalize lung ) . However , effect DM pulmonary inflammatory response specifically AM function yet unknown . PPARγ highly express AMs , thus PPARγ ligands direct affect AMs influence lung inflammation inhibit oxidative burst enhance AM phagocytic function . PPARγ ligands influence AM differentiation M1 ( pro-inflammatory ) M2 ( anti-inflammatory ) phenotypes recent preclinical study demonstrate effective prevention ALI pretreatment PPARγ ligand . However , effect DM PPARγ ligands AM phenotypic differentiation , PPARγ expression , oxidative stress AM phagocytic function well investigate . To knowledge , data AM PPARγ activity DM , little known disease state may alter pulmonary inflammatory milieu . The investigator hypothesize DM reduces risk ALI modulate AM differentiation function via PPARγ expression , oxidative stress AM phagocytic function , may positively influence exposure PPARγ ligand . Examining impact DM PPARγ AM phenotype function may identify mechanism responsible decreased incidence ALI diabetic ; improve understanding pathogenesis common lethal disease , lead novel therapy diabetic non-diabetic critically ill patient</detailed_description>
