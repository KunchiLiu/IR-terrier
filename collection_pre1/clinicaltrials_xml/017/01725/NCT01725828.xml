	<brief_summary>Routine surgery require artificial breathe placement plastic tube patient 's windpipe via mouth nose . This tube serve source provide oxygen patient surgery . Difficulties insertion tube may lead serious complication life-threatening crisis way provide oxygen patient help procedure call cricothyrodotomy ( CTY ) . CTY live saving procedure involve incision patient neck precise location call Cricothyroid Membrane ( CTM ) . The current method identify location palpation neck cartilage operator . The incorrect identification CTM could lead many complication . In certain patient obese distort neck feature would make identification CTM difficult . Ultrasound ( US ) improve success rate many anesthesia procedure .Its use describe identification neck structure however , technique localization validate gold standard use CT scan . The purpose study determine precision identify CTM use US versus conventional finger palpation compare gold standard .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inability secure airway remain frequent cause anesthesia-related mishaps.Difficult airway management continue major challenge anesthesia responsible third anesthesia-related claim single large class close claim injury suits.Difficulties tracheal intubation frequent cause anesthesia-related morbidity mortality . Repeated attempt tracheal intubation result serious soft tissue injury rapidly deteriorate life threaten `` intubate- ventilate '' ( CICV ) crisis . The guideline suggest American Society Anesthesiologists Difficult Airway Society managing unanticipated difficult airway recommend performance cricothyrotomy ( CTY ) next step CICV scenario . Cricothyrotomy infrequently perform life save procedure face difficult CICV airway.Previous study quote , incidence CICV scenario range 0.01-2 per 10,000 cases.It therefore imperative anesthesiologist necessary knowledge skill successfully manage life-threatening airway crisis . However , several study demonstrate many practice anesthesiologist anesthesia trainee ( residents/fellows ) uncomfortable management CICV situation rare event . A recent Canadian survey show quarter resident 40 % practice anesthesiologist comfortable perform cricothyrotomy.Similar finding report German national survey academic teaching hospital difficult airway situation , particularly CICV crisis , poorly manage postulate contributed adverse patient outcomes.Complications emergency CTY physicians common , rate range 9 % 40 % .These complication include failure cannulate trachea , false airway passage , severe bleeding , posterior tracheal wall injury , pneumothorax esophageal laceration . All major complication may relate improper identification anatomical landmark use identify correct position cricothyroid membrane ( CTM ) . The current method CTY rely solely digital palpation landmarks accurately identify CTM . Several study identify independent predictor patient difficult airway . These include characteristic high body mass index , presence beard , short bull neck , distort neck anatomy either due congenital acquire pathology goiter radiation neck . These factor may lead improper identification neck landmarks CTY . The outcome accuracy CTY may improve good preparedness pre-procedural identification neck landmarks CTY decide method anesthetic . This especially true patient anatomical feature difficult airway , may one likely difficult airway require emergency CT.In patient population incorrect localization CTM may lead significant airway morbidity failure quickly establish airway . The role ultrasound airway management : Bedside ultrasound increasingly use assist anesthesiologist perform various procedures.The use ultrasonography ( US ) show significantly reduce complication improve outcomes.Diagnostic application US upper airway anatomy role performance CTY bedside tracheostomy previously describe .However , little known reliability validity US compare gold standard CT scan identifying CTM . The method use identify CTM base identification anatomical landmark digital palpation.10 may difficult patient poorly define anatomy , population likelihood difficult intubation/emergency surgical airway higher . The trachea paratracheal soft tissue neck examine high resolution US probe high frequency due superÔ¨Åcial position . The anterior tracheal wall , thyroid cricoid cartilage , tracheal ring , pre-tracheal tissue may well visualize , allow clinician select optimal space CTY tube placement . The use US assist airway management anesthesia intensive care unit directly related availability low-cost portable US capability . Clinicians initially describe US-guided central venous catheterization , follow US-guided regional anesthesia technique . Recently , study examine role US emergency airway procedure . Nichollas et al develop standardized US technique identify CTM . The finding study suggest CTM relevant structure quickly identify emergency physician use US technique . However study limited patient normal airway mainly focused standardization technique.20 validate technique gold standard . In another study Muhammad et al , report four case ultrasound successfully use perform percutaneous tracheostomy ICU .Cricothyroid membrane easily locate CT scan . In summary , inability secure airway remain frequent cause anesthesia-related morbidity mortality . CTY highly dependent proper identification anatomical land-marks .</detailed_description>
