	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , single-dose , three-period balance crossover study adult healthy subject . Each 18 subject randomize receive treatment sequence consist three treatment ( FF 400 microgram ( mcg ) , UMEC 500 mcg FF 400 mcg/UMEC 500 mcg ) , three consecutive period , wash-out period 7 10 day period . The study include Screening period ( 28 day prior first dose ) , Treatment period ( 3 single dose period separate two 7 10 day washout period ) Follow-up period ( 7 14 day post last dose ) . The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) safety assessment perform study fix timepoints .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test , cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Male female 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Childbearing potential abstinent agree use contraception method list Protocol appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception follow visit ( i.e . follow visit complete ; Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 million international unit ( MlU ) /milliliter ( ml ) estradiol &lt; 40 picograms ( pg ) /ml ( &lt; 147 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use contraception method list Protocol wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Women confirm postmenopausal permanently sterilize ( e.g . tubal occlusion , tubal ligation , hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy ) . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method list Protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication follow visit .

Average QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &lt; 450 miliseconds ( msec ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) within range 19 33 kilogram ( kg ) /meter square ( m2 ) ( inclusive ) . Subjects current nonsmoker use tobacco product 6month period precede screen visit pack history â‰¤10 pack year . [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day /20 ) x number year smoke ] Exclusion Criteria A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive test human Immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 g alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 mililitre [ mL ] ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Unable refrain use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Pregnant female determine positive serum urine hCG test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Subject mentally legally incapacitate . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . History respiratory disease ( i.e . history asthmatic symptom ) last 10 year . Urinary cotinine level indicative smoke history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen . Unable refrain consumption red wine , seville orange , grapefruit grapefruit juice pummelo , exotic citrus fruit , grapefruit hybrid fruit juices 7 day prior first dose study medication . Known suspected sensitivity constituent DPI history severe milk protein allergy . A supine mean heart rate outside range 40 90 beat per minute ( bpm ) screening . Diseases prevent use anticholinergic : Diagnosis narrowangle glaucoma , bladder neck obstruction opinion study investigator GSK medical monitor would pose safety risk use inhale anticholinergic . Other concurrent diseases/abnormalities : A subject must clinically significant , uncontrolled condition disease state , opinion investigator , would put safety patient risk study participation condition/disease exacerbate study .
