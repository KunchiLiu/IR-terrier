	<brief_title>Study Assessing Efficacy Local Consolidative Therapy Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With Induced Oligometastatic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order eligible study , either schedule receive already receive induction chemotherapy without disease get bad . Study Groups : If disease get bad induction chemotherapy , longer eligible participate study study doctor talk option . If disease gotten bad complete induction chemotherapy , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group : Group 1 immediately receive local consolidation therapy ( LCT ) induction chemotherapy . LCT radiation , surgery , . If assign LCT group , study doctor decide radiation alone , surgery alone , radiation combine surgery . Group 2 receive delay LCT induction chemotherapy . The treatment receive depend study doctor think best interest . Group 1 - Immediate Local Consolidation Therapy ( LCT ) : Each study cycle approximately 8 week , may vary doctor think best interest . Surgery : You give separate consent form sign describe surgical procedure risk detail . The type surgery depend status disease . Radiation Therapy : About 1-2 week begin radiation therapy , procedure call simulation . During simulation , exact location radiation therapy plan . The simulation procedure take 1 hour . You receive radiation daily ( Monday Friday ) period last 1 day 8 week , depend location status disease . The radiation take minute administer day . However , ask allow 1 hour day procedure . You give separate consent form sign describe radiation therapy risk detail . The type radiation therapy depend status disease . Group 2 - Delayed/No Local Consolidation Therapy ( LCT ) : If Group 2 , receive surgery radiation therapy right induction chemotherapy . If randomize arm , receive either systemic therapy ( i.e . chemotherapy ) observation . The care receive depend doctor think best interest . Chemotherapy : Each study cycle approximately 8 week , may vary doctor think best interest . If receive chemotherapy , either induction chemotherapy complete receiving LCT , treat physician decide type chemotherapy receive . You give separate consent form sign describe chemotherapy risk detail . The type chemotherapy depend status disease . Study Visits : If study doctor think need , follow test procedure may perform and/or chemotherapy and/or radiation - A physical exam perform , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Your medical history record . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During chemotherapy , study doctor think need , may also compute tomography ( CT ) scan , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan check status disease . These image scan do every 6-8 week first year study check status disease . Length Treatment : You may continue receive study treatment 2 year long doctor think best interest . You may longer able receive study treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visits : All study participant follow-up visit surgery complete , last dose radiation chemotherapy , depend treatment assign . During follow-up visit , may follow test procedure perform study doctor think need : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - Your performance status record . - Your medical history record . - You ask side effect may . - You lung function test check status disease . - You CT scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Your oxygen level measure use small device place tip finger . Other Information : If time study treat physician think best interest , may switch treatment option ( LCT LCT vice versa ) . This investigational study . The combination LCT chemotherapy treatment NSCLC use research purpose . Up 94 patient eligible randomize enrolled study . Up 85 patient enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . STEP 1 Enrollment : The patient diagnosis pathologically confirm NSCLC tumor biopsy and/or fineneedle aspiration . Mixed tumor categorize predominant cell type . 2 . The patient diagnosis American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) 7th Edition stage IV NSCLC . 3 . Three less metastatic lesion ( site ) . * lesion ( include satellite nodule ) individually count one , intrathoracic lymph node involvement ( defined hilar , mediastinal , supraclavicular node , N1N3 ) collectively count one . In addition , patient receive treatment CNS lesion symptomatic lesion require urgent local therapy prior randomization , lesion count towards total number chemotherapy , patient eligible remain site amenable local therapy upfront systemic therapy . 4 . Standard induction chemotherapy plan define : *At least 4 cycle platinum doublet chemotherapy metastatic disease ( without bevacizumab ) , * patient know EGFR mutation positive , erlotinib , afatinib , gefitinib &gt; /=3 month , * patient know EML4ALK fusion , crizotinib &gt; /=3 month 5 . STEP 2 Enrollment Randomization : The patient diagnosis pathologically confirm NSCLC tumor biopsy and/or fineneedle aspiration . Mixed tumor categorize predominant cell type . 6 . The patient diagnosis American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) 7th Edition stage IV NSCLC . 7 . Completion standard induction chemotherapy plan define : *At least 4 cycle platinum doublet chemotherapy metastatic disease ( without bevacizumab ) , *if patient know EGFR mutation positive , erlotinib , afatinib , gefitinib &gt; /=3 month , *for patient know EML4ALK fusion , crizotinib . Note mandatory check EGFR mutation EML4ALK status prior entry , patient receive option 2 3 molecular test perform . 8 . Less equal three metastatic lesion evidence disease progression base RECIST criterion . Note patient &gt; 3 metastatic lesion Step 1 may eligible enrollment Step 2 number metastatic site reduce three less . 9 . The patient 's ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 study entry . 10 . The patient adequate hematologic function define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1,500/mm^3 , platelet count &gt; /= 100,000/mm^3 , WBC &gt; /= 3,000/ mm^3 , hemoglobin &gt; /= 9 g/dL within 3 week study entry . 11 . The patient must suitable candidate LCT ( radiotherapy and/or surgery ) every site disease , determine treat physician ( ) . Consultation multidisciplinary team , include medical oncologist , radiation oncologist , thoracic surgeon , encourage require . 12 . Concurrent chemoradiation permit consolidative therapy . The following concurrent therapy permit : Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( i.e . erlotinib ) deliver hypofractionated &gt; /=3 Gy per fraction ) standard fractionate radiation therapy ( &lt; 3 Gy per fraction ) ; platinumbased chemotherapy standard fractionate radiation therapy ( &lt; 3 Gy per fraction ) 13 . Bevacizumab permit within 2 week initiation radiation therapy course 14 . Treatment central nervous system lesion , brain spine ( prior first line systemic therapy ) , symptomatic lesion require urgent palliative radiation , permit prior randomization , case patient would randomize treatment metastatic site primary site ( base disease remain firstline treatment ) . These treated lesion count towards total number metastasis time enrollment . 15 . The patient &gt; /= 18 year age . 16 . The patient sign informed consent . 17 . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation six ( 6 ) month discontinuation study drug . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month , tubal ligation , hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy .
