	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia public health challenge large proportion patient suffer predominantly negative symptom derive benefit currently available treatment . Advances neuroscience allow great understanding negative symptom identify key structure circuit believe generate maintain . Here , propose application target therapy , deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , alter circuit drive negative symptom . This phase I , non-blinded , non-randomized , pilot trial , explore safety efficacy DBS patient refractory negative symptom schizophrenia . Patients must identify approached treat psychiatrist regard study . Patients give several opportunity review study detail investigator inform consent present . All eligible patient also review independent non-study affiliated psychiatrist confirmation diagnosis assessment study eligibility . The total study duration one year patient , undergo regular image psychiatric analysis .</detailed_description>
