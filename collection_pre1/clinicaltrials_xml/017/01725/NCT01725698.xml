	<brief_summary>This research aim evaluate combination mesenchymal stem cell , HA-CaSO4 , BMP-2 , implant treat critical-sized bone defect . In presence critical-sized bone defect whose defect size 2.5 cm , bone suffer heal disturbance . In treat condition , conventional method vascularise bone graft bone transport . But exist method treatment many weakness Vascularized bone graft procedure high level difficulty . Hence every orthopaedic surgeon able perform . It also take operating time failure rate also quite high . Meanwhile , external fixation apply bone transport , often complain patient term cosmetic psychologically . According diamond concept bone healing , four main factor influence bone healing . These factor osteogenic factor ( mesenchymal stem cell ) , osteconductive factor ( HA-CaSO4 ) , osteoinductive factor ( bone morphogenetic protein-2 ) mechanical component ( implant ) . The potency component fracture heal with/out bone defect prove many study . The combined effect component often study well , critical-sized bone defect .</brief_summary>
