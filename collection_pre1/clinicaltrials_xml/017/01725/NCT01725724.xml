	<brief_title>Effects Sangvia Blood Collection System Postoperative Infections Orthopedic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative infection ( systemic wound infection ) complication avoid due discomfort risk patient correspond increment hospital cost . There study indicate transfusion autologous salvage blood may reduce postoperative infection . This may due immunostimulating cytokine release product . However , cytokine also may cause adverse event febrile transfusion reaction activation complement coagulation cascade , overall impact may different . There two publication Austrian group indicate allogeneic blood transfusion orthopedic patient cause increased postoperative infection rate irrespectively leukocyte content red cell concentrate . The Austrian study randomize . Therefore , would useful perform randomize , prospective study patient receive transfusion salvage blood versus allogeneic red cell concentrate primary replacement product , respectively . The purpose pilot study evaluate transfusion autologous salvage blood reduces infection rate orthopedic patient compare patient receive allogeneic blood transfusion . The study limit one source autologous blood ; blood collect Sangvia Blood Collection System , study partially sponsor manufacturer .</detailed_description>
