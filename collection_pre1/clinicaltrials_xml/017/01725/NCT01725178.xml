	<detailed_description>Train The Brain clinical experimental study effectiveness cognitive physical training slow progression dementia , relationship ( change ) mental cardiovascular fitness . Cognitive decline due age become major clinical economic issue . Italy 700,000 patient dementia 100,000 new case detect every year . Most common cause dementia Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) vascular dementia ( VD ) . No treatment available two condition : drug currently use poorly effective prevent , heal , stop , delay progression disease . It therefore crucial find intervention counteract slow cognitive decline early stage . A combined physical cognitive training could convey benefit . Several study show strengthen social cognitive ability physical exercise exert positive effect brain function elderly , reduce risk develop dementia 20-50 % ; experimental study animal model support finding , also show reversion cognitive decline . On hand , control intervention study human being show methodological limitation . It establish subclinical cerebral alteration , detectable structural functional neuroimaging , appear well clinical disease occur ; call `` Mild Cognitive Impairment '' ( MCI ) dramatically raise risk develop dementia comparison individual without MCI . In condition , progressive decrease number quality synaptic connection specific area brain hypothesize ; intervention aim counteract decrease synaptic function density , augment neural plasticity development spar mnemonical circuit , could slow progression overt dementia . An early detection cognitive impairment could allow exploit residual plasticity nervous system therapeutic/rehabilitative intervention . The work hypothesis project physical cognitive stimulation could positively affect cognitive decline subject risk dementia dementia early stage . This could delay loss self-sufficiency , therefore improve quality life patient caregiver safe relatively cheap intervention , also reduce direct indirect cost caregiving family National Health Service . The present study interventional , parallel group random allocation : - Baseline evaluation ; allocation intervention control ; - Measurement brain volumetry function ; cardiovascular assessment ; - Intervention , usual care control group ; - Evaluation 7 month intervention 7 month completion . Symptoms identify advanced set diagnostic test . In perspective , aim develop non-pharmacologic therapeutic strategy , could easily apply clinical practice structure National Health Service . The presence protocol physical training allows also improve knowledge relationship cardiovascular cerebral fitness condition cognitive decline , aspect virtually unexplored absent current medical literature . Recent study highlight vascular damage systolic hypertension MCI subject represent risk factor progression overt AD , also suggest alteration ideal target secondary prevention . When study complete , possible discern choose program physical exercise cognitive stimulation able reduce , statistically significant degree , progression cognitive decline , measure neuropsychological test , brain damage , evaluate morpho-functional technique , subject AD/VD intervention arm compare control group . If case , combine physical/cognitive intervention procedure propose non-pharmacological preventive therapeutic strategy . A final follow-up evaluation , seven month end intervention , provide information duration effect . Primary endpoint : Evaluation effectiveness combine intervention ( physical exercise + cognitive stimulation ) symptom progression patient MCI due early AD/VD . Outcome index : - Main : Cognitive decline , score neuropsychological test - Rate grey matter white matter loss cortex hippocampus - Variations EEG trace - Improvement cardiovascular parameter ; non-invasive evaluation vascular biomarkers ( endothelial function , local global vascular stiffness , pulse wave analysis ) dedicate technique computer equipment , accord current guideline recommendation , improve accuracy reduce variability - Variations vascular reactivity stimulus : variation cerebral flow , carotid artery flow diameter response carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) inhalation - Increase brain activity , measure functional magnetic resonance imaging , cognitive task In every subject , variation cognitive function , measure functional test image , correlated variation cardiovascular parameter , explore relationship ( change ) brain cardiovascular fitness . If study show benefit intervention arm , another objective development non-pharmacological preventive/therapeutic strategy easily applicable man . The study population make elderly subject mild cognitive impairment confirm neurological examination ; severe pathology bar participation cognitive physical training program substantial exclusion criterion . This intervention study , comparison control group ( i.e. , intervention standard care ) , parallel group random allocation . It conduct accord follow step : Phase 1 - Patient recruitment baseline cognitive evaluation : first screen mini-mental state examination ( MMSE ) , clinical confirmation standard set neuropsychological test ( baseline cognitive status ) ; comprehensive collection medical history physical , cognitive affective examination ; subject confirm diagnosis MCI match inclusion criterion randomly assign either intervention control group , undergo baseline instrumental evaluation . Phase 2 - Baseline instrumental evaluation : measurement brain volumetry function ( functional magnetic resonance , EEG ) ; cardiovascular assessment ultrasound ( flow-mediated dilation brachial artery , measurement carotid intima-media thickness stiffness , aortic stiffness , pulse wave analysis central blood pressure , modification brain blood flow , carotid blood flow carotid diameter response stimulus ) ; Phase 3 - Intervention ( 7 month patient ) . A protocol aerobic physical activity undertaken , 1 hour three time per week , help train experienced personnel , include ( limited ) physiotherapists personal trainer . The protocol include combination aerobic exercise , muscular strengthening , balance improvement joint flexibility . After three month , workload adjust accord new cardiovascular evaluation , optimize train level . For cognitive training , patient undergo select activity three time per week : activity include formal training , game activity lesson practical tip strategy counteract symptom cognitive decline . Patients similarly reevaluate three month . In turn , control group stick usual , standard care . Phase 4 - End intervention : group , intervention control , undergo complete re-evaluation 7 month train / usual care . Phase 5 - Follow : 7 month end training period , group re-evaluated change persistence effect . The whole project , recruitment first patient follow-up examination last , expect complete maximum three year .</detailed_description>
