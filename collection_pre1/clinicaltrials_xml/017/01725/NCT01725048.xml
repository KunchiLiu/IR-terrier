	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Individualized Choice Antidepressants Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) debilitate illness associate increased mortality significant impairment quality life . The prevalence MDD particularly high patient cancer , much 38 % study . The study depression cancer patient particularly important , co-morbid illness frequently complicate management . In addition affect quality life , poorly control depression affect cancer treatment adherence lead poor treatment outcome . Depression challenge diagnose patient cancer . A spectrum depressive symptom see , range appropriate sadness response life threaten diagnosis , major depressive episode . The diagnosis confound symptom bring cancer treatment , fatigue , insomnia , anorexia , pain .

Once diagnosis make , several tool create validated purpose assess severity depression follow severity time . The tool intend use study PHQ-9 . Therapy MDD general population include psychotherapy pharmacological intervention . However , optimal therapy MDD cancer patient remain uncertain . Very placebo control trial perform population , currently uniformly accept standard care . Some evidence study depress otherwise medically healthy patient may applicable cancer patient , several factor complicate treatment depression group . For example , overlap symptom depression underlie malignancy confound diagnosis , discuss earlier . Simultaneous treatment underlie malignancy introduces adverse effect surgery , chemotherapy , radiation , well increase likelihood drug-drug interaction . Finally , co-morbid condition cancer pain contribute depression , require simultaneous therapy . As result unique factor , treatment MDD cancer patient necessarily approach use standard recommendation general population . There scant evidence support effectiveness pharmacologic therapy cancer patient MDD . In last 25 year four placebo control trial publish , two show statistically significant improvement depression score active treatment . Additional study need evaluate newer antidepressant within cancer population ass whether strategy matching side effect symptoms beneficial .</detailed_description>
