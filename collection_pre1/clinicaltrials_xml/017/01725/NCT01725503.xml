	<brief_summary>The goal present study quantify rate synthesis creatine healthy control endurance trained subject . In addition , effect oral creatine supplement seven day creatine kinetics examine . Ten healthy control ( age 20-35 year ) ten endurance trained subject recruit advertisement . Endurance trained subject recruit health club . They screen absence chronic disease ( history , physical examination , CBC , metabolic liver panel , urinalysis ) . A DEXA measurement do quantify whole body skeletal muscle mass . For five ( 5 ) day prior study , place creatine-free ( essentially meat-free ) diet . Dietary compliance ensure repeat communication subject , nurse coordinator CRU Nutritionist . Subject maintain daily record food intake validation . On last day , i.e . 24 hour prior tracer study , subject collect 24 hour urine sample bring CRU day study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Creatine phosphocreatine major intracellular buffer adenosine triphosphate . They also function energy shuttle high energy phosphate mitochondrial site production cytoplasmic site utilization . In addition , creatine show affect satellite cell proliferation differentiation increase cell mitotic activity compensatory hypertrophy rat skeletal muscle . Creatine synthesize three amino acid : glycine , arginine methionine . Although creatine metabolism study extensively rat , data regard kinetics creatine regulation human limit . This part due large slow turn pool creatine lack good tracer method . Using recently develop stable isotopic tracer method ( u ) , propose quantify rate synthesis creatine regulation healthy subject large skeletal muscle mass result endurance training . In addition , response oral creatine administration creatine kinetics quantify . The site regulation identify relative rate appearance tracer glycine guanidinoacetic acid creatine . It hypothesize fractional rate synthesis creatine high endurance trained subject , creatine suppress rate synthesis creatine . Since creatine critical maintenance skeletal muscle mass satellite cell proliferation , data provide normative physiological data future study subject manifest sarcopenia , age , chronic disease , e.g . cirrhosis liver . These data form basis study creatine metabolism neurodegenerative disorder creatine increasingly use therapeutic agent .</detailed_description>
