	<brief_summary>Constraint-induced movement therapy ( CI therapy ) highly efficacious treatment residual motor disability chronic stroke . Its effectiveness believe due , least part , therapy 's ability aid brain `` rewiring . '' For example , CI therapy produce increase amount grey matter ( part brain neuron cell body closely cluster ) certain area human brain ( Gauthier et al. , 2008 ) . The cellular molecular mechanism responsible increase grey matter volume know , however . Thus , unclear therapy help brain `` rewire '' . This study aim well understand timecourse cellular/molecular nature brain change CI therapy . Because currently way directly measure cellular/molecular change brain noninvasively , study infer happen microstructural level use new MRI technique ( three dimensional picture brain ) . For example , chart timecourse grey matter change CI therapy , cross-comparing know timecourses different cellular/molecular process , investigator gain great understand cellular process may responsible increase grey matter . The investigator gain additional information cellular process important rehabilitation-induced improvement measure larger-scale change ( e.g. , amount blood flow different brain area ) accompany cellular change . The investigator hopeful well understand CI therapy change brain , effectiveness rehabilitation improve upon . For example , insight mechanism rehabilitation-induced brain change may suggest particular drug target increase brain plasticity . This study help u good understand brain repairs injury .</brief_summary>
