	<brief_summary>The objective project develop non-invasive prenatal diagnostic test trisomy 21 reliable , sensitive cost-effective , thus , offer alternative currently employ invasive diagnostic test amniocentesis chorionic villus sample . Current prenatal screening method ( blood marker ultrasound ) trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ) detect 90 % case false positive rate &gt; 90 % . The result test express risk trisomy 21 , threshold France 1/250 . Women exhibit high risk offer undergo invasive diagnostic testing , either amniocentesis chorionic villus sampling . However , invasive diagnostic method associate considerable risk miscarriage ( 1-3 % ) , thus underline importance develop safe non-invasive prenatal diagnostic test trisomy 21 . The investigator plan assess clinical impact non-invasive prenatal method detect Trisomy 21 genetic analysis circulate trophoblastic cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan developed follow approach : fetal cell first enrich blood pregnant woman , 7 12 week gestation , employ ISET ( isolation size epithelial tumor cell ) technique . Cells presume fetal origin microdissected subsequently genetically analyze , use STR marker , verify fetal nature . The investigator plan test two strategy order ass number copy chromosome 21 . The first one involve DNA single fetal cell analyze CGH ( comparative genomic hybridization ) array . In fact , team already developed application metaphase CGH method single cell isolated ISET able demonstrate gain chromosome 21 DNA single fetal cell isolate cord blood fetus Down syndrome . The second strategy accomplish use quantitative fluorescent PCR analysis short tandem repeat ( STRs ) , apply single cell . At least 5-8 highly polymorphic STR marker specific chromosome 21 test minimize effect phenomenon call allele drop , one allele fail amplify , maximize number triallelic signal accurate diagnosis disomy trisomy 21 . This survey perform collaboration Department Gynaecology-Obstetrics - Reproductive Medicine Antoine Béclère Hospital Clamart . The woman include survey take 20 ml blood sample cervical Pap smear invasive test ( amniocentesis ) . The blood sample treat ISET method within 3 hour collection filter store - 20°C . The cell obtain Pap smear keep appropriate liquid treat ISET method Biochemistry Laboratory Necker Hospital . The molecular analysis direct Trophoblastic cell NI-PND Trisomy 21 perform blind study . The instigator plan use ISET method blind study include 100 case trisomy 21 300 control case normal caryotype . This study allow obtain result sensitivity high 97 % specificity high 99 % ( IC 95 % [ 70-100 ] ) . The validation obtain open blind study comparison result obtain invasive method ( amniocentesis ) non-invasive method .</detailed_description>
