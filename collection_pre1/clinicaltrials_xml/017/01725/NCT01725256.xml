	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness investigational/experimental drug call AIR001 . To test effectiveness , study evaluate AIR001 affect blood vessel lung function heart . This do monitoring change Pulmonary Vascular Resistance ( PVR ) ; Baseline/Day 1 ( start study drug ) Week 16 study . PVR measure resistance flow blood vessel lung . The study include assessment evaluate effect study drug PAH , include measurement exercise ability evaluation PAH disease symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Determine Safety Efficacy AIR001 Subjects With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy inhale nebulized AIR001 administer , 16 week , accord 3 treatment arm ( 80 mg daily , 46 mg 4 time daily , 80 mg 4 time daily ) subject World Health Organization ( WHO ) Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) , determine change Pulmonary Vascular Resistance ( PVR ) Baseline Week 16 measure immediately post completion AIR001 nebulization ( soon feasible ) .</detailed_description>
