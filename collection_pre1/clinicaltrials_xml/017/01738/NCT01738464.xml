	<detailed_description>Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC ) Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome ( CP/CPPS ) characterize chronic pelvic pain void dysfunction . IC CP/CPPS remain enigma within urology , know etiology widely effective therapy . However , IC , CP/CPPS , depress patient suffer bowel co-morbidities , well establish GI tract influence bladder function , mood sensation via pelvic organ crosstalk . Like body site , gut harbor rich microflora . Studies characterize microbial diversity relative abundance particular body site , `` microbiome , '' reveal microbiomes play critical role normal cellular organ function , thus importance emphasize Human Microbiome Project ( HMP ) , NIH Common Fund initiative . CPPS patient suffer chronic pelvic pain dramatically low quality life , yet diagnostic marker effective therapy remain elusive costly syndrome . IC debilitate condition pelvic pain void dysfunction afflict 8 million U.S. woman depression common co-morbidity , distinct over-active bladder ( OAB ) patient lack pain . IC etiology remain unknown , urothelial lesion lamina propria mast cell associated patient symptom . Similarly , CP/CPPS afflict 1 22 men U.S. pain void sexual symptom , distinct patient irritative void low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) . And although leukocyte observe prostatic fluid patient , etiology CP/CPPS also remain unknown . Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA ) dysfunction implicate female male patient cat feline IC , thus may common among CPPS , mechanism integrates pelvic pain , void dysfunction , HPA activity , depression lacking . Microbiomes also dynamic subject skewing , change increasingly associate disease include Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , obesity , possibly depression . Antibiotic therapy alter microbiomes , often cause temporary dysfunction sometimes result disease colitis . Since IC CP/CPPS patient often history urinary tract infection ( UTI ) , typically receive multiple course antibiotic . This therapeutic history IC CP/CPPS patient may adverse consequence two reason . First , potential skewing gut microbiome may alter normal sensory functional homeostatic mechanism , contribute pain void dysfunction . Second , alter gut microbiome may foster uropathogen reservoir expansion , preliminary data demonstrate urinary E. coli isolate induce chronic pelvic pain persist long microbial clearance . Together line reason raise provocative possibility microbiomes contribute IC , CP/CPPS , depression directly supply uropathogens indirectly organ crosstalk dysfunction . Therefore , alter gastrointestinal tract microbiome associate IC , CP/CPPS , and/or depression ? Our team marries core NIH NIDDK mission , digestive disease kidney/urologic , address novel question synergistic expertise clinical diagnosis IC , CP/CPPS , depression , quantify GI tract microbiomes , neural mechanism microbe-induced pelvic pain . Stool sample analyze 16S rDNA sequence silico metagenome analysis identify taxon , abundance , function . Computational tool use identify taxon amenable rapid evaluation stool . Stool , serum , urine evaluate small molecule specific CPPS , putative mediator test mice effect pelvic pain urinary function .</detailed_description>
