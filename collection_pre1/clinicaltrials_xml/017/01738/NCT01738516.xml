	<brief_summary>Electroencephalography ( EEG ) high spatial resolution ( HR-EEG , 256 electrode ) allow good analysis local global activity cerebral cortex , compare conventional EEG . Since January 2012 , Neurology Department CHU Rennes first clinical service France equip system . Applied HR-EEG recording , brain connectivity method likely provide essential information ( form `` connectivity graph '' ) cortical network , either dysfunctional , involved generation interictal paroxysm ( like spike spike-waves ) seizure . So far , many method propose ( see review : Wendling et al. , 2009 ; Wendling et al. , 2010 ) . However , since method highly sensitive type model assume underlying relationship distinct brain region ( Ansari-Asl et al. , 2006 ) , none yet demonstrate effectiveness .</brief_summary>
