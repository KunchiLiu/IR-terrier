	<brief_summary>The Ilizarov external fixator external skeletal fixator use stabilize lengthen limb bone . Bone lengthen bone occur mechanical distraction long axis bone , thus method lengthen call distraction osteogenesis . This method show successful . Unfortunately , also associate substantial number complication . Muscle shorten persistent weakness among common complication see procedure . Muscle shorten usually occur strong muscle group planter flexor muscle , result strength imbalance oppose muscle group . Shortening may persist year removal fixator may require surgical intervention . Fortunately , muscular shortening prevent splint physiotherapy form stretch strengthen exercise functional training . The use different exercise rehabilitation help accomplish different therapeutic goal . Thus , choice use one depend desire treatment goal . Weight bearing ( CKC ) non weight bearing ( OKC ) exercise incorporate rehabilitation ; however , effect two type exercise particularly muscle flexibility mechanic never study systematically . Therefore , purpose compare effect OKC CKC exercise muscle strength , architecture flexibility . General Hypothesis : The use open kinetic close kinetic chain exercise different effect muscle function internal organization tibial distraction osteogenesis Ilizarov 's method Specific hypotheses 1 . There difference effect OKC CKC muscle flexibility . 2 . There difference effect OKC CKC exercise muscle strength . 3 . There difference effect OKC CKC internal organization muscle specifically pennation angle , muscle thickness fiber length . 4 . There difference overall OKC CKC exercise functional performance patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>First , personal information history subject collect . Then , patient inform receive full oral explanation purpose procedure study ask sign inform consent form . An initial assessment do end latent period ( 5-7 day ) every 2 week thereafter period 3-5cm distraction end distraction period whatever earlier . Patients enrol study divide randomly two group ( A &amp; B ) . Group A ( OKC ) : consist 10 patient receive open-kinetic- chain exercise program . Group B ( CKC ) consist 10 patient receive closed-kinetic- chain exercise program . Initially , patient assess use Borg scale determine number strengthen exercise repetition patient carry . Assessment repeat weekly , number repetition progress . For stretch exercise , 5 repeat ion do session , addition patient ask repeat exercise home program exercise . Exercise give 3 time weekly , University Benha outpatient clinic , period 3-5 cm distraction ( approximately 8 week ) end distraction whatever early Exercise group ( A ) Knee flexion exercise Patient supine gently bend knee , keep heel contact bed . Bring heel towards bottom far comfortable .Exercise repeat determine patient 's ability . Strength hamstring muscle Patient prone lie position knee free bed . Patient ask bend knee make heel touch bottom . Strength quadriceps muscle Patient sit edge bed chair thigh support . Patient ask keep trunk upright . Then , knee straighten hold toe point ceiling 6 second . Stretch hamstring sit : Patients assume long sit position non-operated extremity hang edge bed . Patients lean forward , grasp his/her forefoot dorsiflex ankle maintain knee extend . This position maintain 20-60 second return start position . The whole exercise repeat 5 time . Stretch hamstring prone : Patients assume prone lying position . The leg operate limb position neutral rotation allow hang freely , edge bed , weight leg apparatus well pull effect gravity . This position maintain duration range 1 minute long tolerate every individual patient . Patients also instruct assume position frequently home daily activity e.g . watch television reading book . Strength hip extensor abductor : Patient prone extend knee . Patient ask raise low limb upward knee extend . For abductor strengthening , patient side lie position non-operated limb ask raise upper limb upwards knee kept straight . Calf-muscles stretch : To stretch gastrocnemius , patient 's heel grasp knee extend . Then , calcaneus pull caudally , thumb finger therapist , head metatarsal gently push upwards . The end position hold 20-60 second rest allow . Strength exercise dorsiflexors plantar flexor Patient long sit use Theraband one end hand end secure around metatarsal bone patient perform plantar flexion resistance surgical tube repeat 10 time . Exercise group ( B ) Wall slide Patient stand back wall , foot straight front . Patient slide keep back wall , become slight sit position . Slide far patient feel comfortable . For first time patient knee exercise , hold sit position second , slide back repeat 10 time . Foot slide sit While patient sit smooth surface , patient pull heel involve leg toward buttock , flex knee much tolerable . Hold straighten leg slide heel downward . Hamstring quadriceps co-contraction sit From relax sit position knee bend 90 degree , patient instruct press firmly ground . This exercise also do use stepper machine . Patient instruct press rhythmically foot plate stepper machine , maintain foot complete contact plate , heel vertical . Bridging exercise : Patient assume crock lie position . In position , knees bent 30-45 degree foot completely rest support surface place firm wedge underneath foot accommodate support surface . Then , patient instruct raise low back pelvis , bear weight lower limb , thigh lie line pelvis trunk . Side-to side , forward backward weight shifting : Patient assume erect stand position . Both foot place slightly apart operate limb place parallel , front behind sound side side-to-side , forward backward weight shift exercise , respectively . Sitting-to-standing : Patient assume relaxed sit position . The foot affect extremity place initially front , later , behind side . Patient instruct assume stand positing , bear much weight affect extremity . Lunge exercise : Patient assume forward lunge position . In position , affect limb place front . The distance subject lunge forward determine individual 's leg length foot 2 3 foot apart , depend patient 's leg length . Then , subject move upright stand position forward lunge position , back start position . Squatting exercise : Patient instruct stand erect , parallel bar , foot parallel slightly apart . While maintain back erect , instructed bend knee slightly return back erect standing position push foot . Standing Toe Raises : This exercise advance seat toe raise , place entire weight body exercise leg . Stand upright foot Push toe lift heel ground Standing Hamstring Stretch : Patient stand front elevate surface . Place operate leg surface , Lean forward hips gentle hamstring stretch felt underside thigh . Once gentle hamstring stretch felt underside thigh , hold position 30 second</detailed_description>
