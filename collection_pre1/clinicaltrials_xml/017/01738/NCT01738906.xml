It hypothesize reward response food beverage already generate food beverage sense mouth , oral nutrient sense know induce satiety response ( i.e . cephalic phase response ) . Moreover , taste bud directly signal brain area closely connect reward area brain . Primary objective - To determine whether moderate alcohol consumption influence subsequent food reward , measure questionnaire food 'wanting ' food 'liking ' , salivary blood parameter related reward . Secondary objective - To determine whether food reward different food consume food sense mouth , measure questionnaire food 'wanting ' food 'liking ' , salivary blood parameter relate food reward . - To determine whether moderate alcohol consumption influence subsequent food reward differently food consume food sense mouth , measure questionnaire food 'wanting ' food 'liking ' , salivary blood parameter relate food reward .</brief_summary>
