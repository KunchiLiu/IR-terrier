	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT : Tonsillectomies adenoidectomy ( T &amp; A ) commonly perform pediatric surgery ( NIH , 2010 ) . Surgery understandably anxiety provoke child family . Research show anxiety influence post-operative recovery ( Kain , 2004 , 2012 ; Lynch , 1998 ; Schisler , 1998 ; Vaurio , 2006 ) . Anxiety , emergence agitation emergence delirium ( EA/D ) pain recovery general anesthesia identify frequent problem pediatric population , particularly young child ( Key , 2010 ) relate increase length stay . Perioperative stress often prolonged effect . After surgery , 88 % child develop new-onset post-operative maladaptive behavioral change . These change refer developmental regression behavior interfere daily function general anxiety , nighttime cry , enuresis , separation anxiety , night terror , temper tantrum etc ) . Alarmingly , 54 % child demonstrate maladaptive behavior 2 week follow surgery 20 % child continue demonstrate negative behavior 6 month postoperatively . Research show young child even high risk ( Kain , 2004 ; Watson , 2003 ) . Healing Touch biofield therapy show decrease pain anxiety adult ( Im , 2009 ; Jain , 2010 ) premature infant ( Hanley , 2008 ; Im , 2009 , Whitley , 2008 ) . For several year Holistic Health Specialist Nurses train Healing Touch Healing Touch Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center 's Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( CCHMC 's PACU ) . Nurses anecdotally noted patient receive Healing Touch seem wake calmer , often need less pain medication less stressful surgery . CCHMC nurse report Healing Touch especially useful anxious child young child . Healing Touch ( HT ) complementary therapy non-invasive , low-cost therapy without know side effect easily incorporate post-operative care routine . The desired study outcome Healing Touch treatment group : 1 . Lower anxiety level , measure difference Perioperative Adult Child Behavioral Interaction Scale ( PACBIS ) score pre &amp; postoperatively . This behavioral assessment child 's cop distress parent positive negative behavior . Parent also self evaluated distress anxiety . The Healing Touch group lower sympathetic response measure preoperative sequential post-operative B/P , Pulse , Respirations , &amp; pulse oximetry 2 . Less emergence agitation delirium measure Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium ( PAED ) score , observational scale do sequentially enter recovery room 3 . Less pain measure Faces , Legs , Activity , Cry , Consolability ( FLACC ) scale significantly less pain medication usage 4 . Waking slowly enter PACU 5 . Shorter length stay PACU , measure meeting PACU 's discharge criterion . 6 . Significantly less regression maladaptive behavior measure Post-Hospital Behavior Questionnaire ( PHBQ ) 2 week follow surgery . 7 . Fewer readmission complication 2 week follow surgery identify family guardian 2 week follow call . The significance study outcomes add body knowledge practice Healing Touch child , may provide evidence substantiate benefit Healing Touch post-operative pediatric patient . This may lead incorporation Healing Touch pediatric nursing practice . Preschool child high risk extend stressful response surgery , i.e . regression maladaptive behavior ( Vernon , 1966 ) . Preschoolers vivid imagination magical thinking . They may trouble tell fantasy reality . The often develop fear related new place experience separation parent . There identified effective supportive measure improve protract stress outcome . Healing Touch may tool comfort support vulnerable population may helpful hospitalized child .</detailed_description>
