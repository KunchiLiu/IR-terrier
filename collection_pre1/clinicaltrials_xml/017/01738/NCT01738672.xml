	<brief_title>Inhaled Nitrous Oxide Labor Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhalational anesthetic agent use since mid 1800s help alleviate pain associate labor . James Simpson John Snow initially utilize ether chloroform respectively 1847 1853 . Stanislav Klikovich follow predecessor footstep successfully administer nitrous oxide labor analgesia 1881 . Although many inhalational agent consider labor analgesia since time , administration nitrous oxide refine last century remain common practice obstetrical anesthesia today . Since time , nitrous oxide find effective labor analgesia many woman , although provide less pain relief compare labor epidural , find safe mother , baby , health care provider . Nitrous oxide currently use 60 % laboring woman United Kingdom , 50 % woman deliver Australia nearly 50 % parturients Canada Finland . This compare recent article report two United States hospital routinely offer nitrous oxide labor analgesia majority labor woman request epidural . The epidural rate Unites States average nearly 90 % compare 14-38 % part world . Nitrous oxide easy administer non-flammable , odorless inhalational agent produce analgesia anxiolysis . It believe mechanism action nitrous oxide release endogenous opioid peptide periaqueductal gray area midbrain stimulates descend noradrenergic pathway result analgesia . These pathway modulate pain dorsal horn spinal cord alpha-2 adrenoreceptors . Anxiolytic effect think cause inhibition N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . In Swedish study involve 1,997 parturients utilize inhaled nitrous oxide sole anesthetic labor analgesia , 37.6 % participant report effective pain relief . Currently , rate labor epidural analgesia Magee Womens Hospital approximately 90 % . There many advantage use nitrous oxide labor analgesia compare epidural . Complications associate labor epidural analgesia include infection , bleeding , headache , wet-tap . These complication result prolonged hospital stay associate use nitrous oxide labor analgesia . One big advantage use nitrous oxide labor analgesia significantly low cost administer compare epidural . In recent article Birth journal , note use nitrous oxide far less expensive much simpler epidural analgesia result complication require additional treatment prolong hospital stay . The use nitrous could major financial benefit Medicaid private insurance company . In 2004 , large cost insurance entity cost care pregnant labor woman report cost $ 41 billion . The significant cost saving would reduction anesthesia service . Currently average cost per patient anesthesia staff coverage 728 dollar . Average re-imbursement labor epidural placement 385 dollar . Nitrous oxide require anesthesia staff implement , save health care dollar . After initial investment nitrous oxide machine , additional cost would tube mask patient nitrous oxide oxygen E-cylinders delivery . With Nitrous oxide many quality make attractive choice labor analgesia , many anesthesia provider question limited use United States . It speculate may cultural issue woman make decision regard labor analgesia base learned experience family friend , many heard use nitrous oxide cope labor pain . Another reason may author argue nitrous oxide orphan drug pizzazz professional group company profit use cause environmental occupational hazard limit use . No definitive opinion exist answer question . Finally , author suggest use limited due disadvantage nitrous oxide , include possibility cause mood alteration , euphoria , impaired mentation , dysphoria , inappropriate behavior nausea vomit . These side effect limited number fail-safe mechanism build nitrous oxide machine include delivery least 30 % oxygen 3 liter fresh gas flow . In addition proper use include self administration direct supervision train provider nitrous oxide use .</detailed_description>
