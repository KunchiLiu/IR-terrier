	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate efficacy safety two different dos NEFECON treatment patient primary IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) risk develop end-stage renal disease , rigorous blood pressure control angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) and/or angiotensin II receptor I blocker ( ARB ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Nefecon® Patients With Primary IgA Nephropathy Risk Developing End-stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NEFECON add-on treatment medication nephropathy symptom kidney function , include ACEI and/or ARBs . Rigorous blood pressure control achieve 6-month Run-in Phase ACEI and/or ARB dose target blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mm Hg UPCR &lt; 0.5 g/g . Patients complete Run-in Phase , despite optimize ACEI and/or ARB therapy , UPCR ≥0.5 g/g OR urine protein ≥0.75 g/24hr eligible randomization entry treatment phase trial . Patients remain ACEI and/or ARB dose regimen duration trial . Patients enter treatment phase administer NEFECON ( 8 mg/day OR 16 mg/day ) OR placebo phase 9 month . A 3-month follow-up phase follow treatment phase , first 2 week use taper dose patient receive 16 mg/day dose 8 mg/day , placebo 8 mg/day group receive placebo retain blinding .</detailed_description>

Estimated GFR ( use CKDEPI formula ) OR measure GFR ≥50 mL/min per 1.73 m2 OR ≥45 mL/min per 1.73m2 patient maximum recommended maximum tolerate dose ACEI and/or ARB 5 . Willing change antihypertensive medication regimen applicable 6 . Willing able give inform consent Screening 1 . Secondary form IgA nephropathy define treat physician ( example , HenochSchönlein purpura patient associate alcoholic cirrhosis ) 2 . Presence crescent formation ≥50 % glomerulus assess renal biopsy 3 . Kidney transplant patient 4 . Severe gastrointestinal disorder ( include peptic ulcer disease inflammatory bowel disease ) may impair drug effect , condition could modify effect trial drug judge Investigator 4 .
