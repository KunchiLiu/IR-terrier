	<brief_summary>In recent year , diabetic nephropathy , may lead dialysis treatment , prevalent underlying disease people develop country . A wide range study carry , various point view , understand progress renal dysfunction diabetic nephropathy . Fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF-23 ) primary regulator renal phosphate excretion . FGF23 inversely associate GFR , relationship underlying fundamental mechanism maintain serum phosphate constancy CKD progression . Such adaptation may deleterious trade-off , independently serum phosphate , high FGF23 signal high risk death ESRD patient . Some study show relationship FGF-23 level proteinuria CKD patient . There data effect calcium channel blocker FGF23 level diabetic patient proteinuria . The aim study find whether beneficial effect calcium channel blocker diabetic proteinuria relation alteration FGF-23 level . The investigator search effect calcium channel blocker amlodipine clinical laboratory parameter diabetic patient proteinuria . The investigator register study 'The effect renin angiotensin system Blockage ( RAS ) , calcium channel blocker combine drug TWEAK , PTX3 FMD level Diabetic Proteinuric Patients Hypertension ' ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT00921570 ) . The investigator use sample patient study . The investigator also register study 'FGF-23 Endothelial Dysfunction Diabetic Proteinuric Patients ' ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01703234 ) . The investigator combine two registered study ( NCT00921570 NCT01703234 ) one study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Calcium Channel Blocker Serum Fibrobalst Growth Factor-23 ( FGF-23 ) Levels Type-2 Diabetic Patients With Proteinuria Purpose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient non-obese ( BMI &lt; 30kg/m2 ) , non dyslipidemic ( total cholesterol &lt; 200mg/dl , Triglyceride &lt; 150mg/dl ) , free cardiovascular event ( negative medical history , negative ECG finding ) investigate enrollment . CKD stage 1 patient old 18 year age willing participate study screen . From 231 patient establish type 2 diabetes mellitus , 126 proteinuria and/or hypertension ( 24 h protein excretion 1-2 g/day , systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg , respectively ) . All case first referral time study treatment . Patients history coronary artery disease , smoker take statin renin-angiotensin blocker exclude effect factor endothelial dysfunction . Of 61 screen patient 32 meet study criterion include study . The duration proteinuria diabetic nephropathy initial diagnosis know . The exclusion criterion follow : A ) Nephrotic syndrome , B ) coronary heart disease ( patient ischemic ST-T alteration voltage criterion LVH electrocardiogram , history revascularization myocardial infarction ) , C ) elevate liver enzyme ( AST ALT level ≥ 40U/L ) D ) renal failure ( serum creatinine level &gt; 1.3 mg/dl ) . In order evaluate effect calcium channel blocker serum FGF-23 concentration , patient proteinuria give calcium channel blocker ( Amlodipine 10 mg/day ) 12 week . The effect calcium channel blocker insulin sensitivity proteinuria also investigate . After intervention period , blood sample obtain assay plasma PTX3 concentration , HbA1c , insulin resistance score ( HOMA-IR ) . Urine sample also collect 24-hour period determine degree proteinuria .</detailed_description>
