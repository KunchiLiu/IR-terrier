	<brief_summary>In patient undergo craniotomy , 0.9 % normal saline commonly administer order reduce cerebral edema . Excessive administration 0.9 % normal saline report cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis . On hand , hypovolemia due insufficient fluid replacement perioperative loss also result metabolic acidosis lactic acid accumulation . However , guideline perioperative fluid management yet establish . The investigator hypothesize intraoperative fluid management accord SVV ( Stroke Volume Variation ) could reduce perioperative metabolic acidosis compare CVP ( Central Venous Pressure ) . Therefore , study try determine intraoperative fluid administration base SVV could reduce metabolic acidosis compare CVP patient undergo craniotomy due brain tumor receive 0.9 % normal saline main fluid regimen .</brief_summary>
