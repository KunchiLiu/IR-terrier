	<detailed_description>Introduction : Crohn 's disease well-characterized disease , treatment carry accord international guideline . Despite , disease often show individual , unpredictable course , half patient experience significant complication disease . Endoscopy important assessment disease dissemination severity Crohn 's disease , complement biochemical clinical index , include CDAI Simple Index ( SI ) ( Harwey-Bradshaw ) , internationally recognize . By CDAI , show good correlation biochemical activity marker CRP , serum albumin , practice simplify version ( SI ) . Is often use . Knowledge use CLE Crohn 's disease low . We basis parameter suggest small study personal CLE experience determine parameter useful precise estimation severity Crohn 's disease . Since disease commonly see terminal ileum , parameter apply ileum colon . A group Crohn patient long prolonged biochemical conventional endoscopic remission , include patient treated biologic drug infliximab . These patient also include study particularly interesting subgroup CLE small study suggest contribute safe discontinuation immunosuppressive therapy . The degree heal mucous membrane include intact barrier function one important prognostic factor patient develop recurrence . Thus great clinical importance clarify whether CLE help distinguish patient apparently normal endoscopy , yet unrealized discrete activity defective barrier function patient activity evaluate endoscopically CLE . Furthermore , small number patient include control group . Hypothesis : CLE characterize Crohn 's disease activity precisely ileum colon compare conventional ileocolonoscopy , include detect slight degree wider dissemination inflammation would otherwise recognize . Design : A blinded prospective observation method study patient subsequent calculation intra-and inter-observer variability . Method : The patient enrol include control group , investigate respectively , conventional colonoscopy CLE terminal ileum colon . The degree extent Crohn 's disease assess conventional ileocolonoscopy ( SI ) , CLE ( select parameter ) histology biopsy . Terminal ileum colonic segment ( caecum , ascend colon , transversal colon , descend colon , colon sigmoid rectum ) assess describe . Then , correlation histology ( gold standard ) , SI CLE calculate . An intra-and inter-observer study follow CLE parameter , 3 observer blind respect . The pathologist blind conventional CLE parameter . CLE result stratify order identify record CLE parameter correlate best two method , thus suitable characterization activity Crohn 's disease . Statistical method : To calculate CLE-finding relation respectively , SI histology use Spearman correlation analysis . At inter-and intra-observer study use weight Kappa . Patient : A complete sample-size calculation make inter-and intra-observer study individual CLE parameter 3 observer . For , possible , achieve kappa value 0.9 confidence interval 0.05 , must 122 observation . If succeed register SI score , CLE parameter take tissue sample pathology intestinal segment , 7 observation patient subsequently assess relation parameter use study . If ileocolonoscopy complete CLE observation possible analyze 18 patient need enrol study . It assume , however , 50 % expect observation CLE observation unsatisfactory procedure interrupt . Thus , 36 patient shall include study achieve desire strength , 10 control group .</detailed_description>
