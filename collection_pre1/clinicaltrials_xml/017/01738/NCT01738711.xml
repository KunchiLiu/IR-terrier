	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) chronic progressive lung disease unknown cause effective medical treatment . The main symptom increase breathlessness cough significantly impact quality life ( QOL ) often leading anxiety depression . The focus disease management shift pharmacological attempt reduce disease progression manage symptom holistic approach . Cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) increasingly use treat anxiety depression chronic disease . Our investigator aim determine whether CBT reduce anxiety depression relate symptom improve QOL patient IPF . This study compare CBT intervention ( Group 1 ) standard treatment ( Group 2 ) . Patients recruit specialist IPF clinic - patient attend IPF suffer anxiety eligible participate study . The study aim recruit 30 patient ( 15 group ) . Patients randomly allocate group use envelope concealment system . At entry baseline visit conduct information gather regard disease severity , hospital admission , medication , symptom ( subjective objective ) , quality life anxiety depression use questionnaire routine clinical test . Patients receive CBT intervention ( Group 1 ) intervention ( Group 2 ) . Patients receive CBT undergo maximum 6 ( minimum 2 ) individual therapy session . Follow visit group conduct 3 , 6 , 9 12 month information gather baseline visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does CBT Improve Perception/Impact Cough Breathlessness IPF Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical therapy ( e.g . prednisolone , azathioprine N-acetylcysteine ) show benefit patient IPF may cause harm . Therefore focus management shift towards holistic approach-management symptom patient cope , chronic progressive terminal disease . Anxiety recognise contribute patient ' perception symptoms quality life . CBT increasingly use chronic respiratory disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) evidence reduces anxiety breathlessness . Currently evidence regard use IPF . If CBT show reduce anxiety help patient cope symptom cough breathlessness integrate care IPF patient improve quality life . All patient attend specialist IPF clinic ask complete hospital anxiety depression questionnaire ( HADS ) . All anxiety ( HADS-A equal great 8 ) eligible entry . Study information provide patient contact 24 48 hour later telephone confirm wish enter study . If wish participate hospital visit arrange complete informed consent , gather baseline information randomise . If allocate CBT intervention group receive maximum 6 ( minimum 2 ) session CBT individual basis . Patients allocate placebo group receive write information anxiety management . All patient attend four clinic visit three , six , nine twelve month randomisation . At clinic visit complete five questionnaire ( total 60 question ) undergo lung function six minute walk test . They consent wear cough monitor 24 hour period baseline 3 month visit . The cough monitor record number time patient cough long cough 24 hour period . A small microphone attach clothing another small microphone chest wall connect small recording device . The device carry around waist . The patient return cough monitor follow day . The monitor record cough sound also sound around microphone . However , computer software use remove part record sound , read sleep . It also design remove distant noise , another person 's conversation noise television depend loud close noise microphone . The anonymised recording analyse trained researcher Manchester University count number cough . The recording keep confidential store anonymously University Manchester period 15 year .</detailed_description>
