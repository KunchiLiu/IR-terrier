	<brief_summary>A 2 2 factorial , multicenter , prospective , randomize , open-label , blind endpoint trial . Patients undergo primary PCI STEMI eligible . Enrolled patient randomly assign ticagrelor group clopidogrel group 1:1 ratio . After emergent coronary angiography , patient thrombolysis myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) flow grade &lt; 2 coronary angiogram randomize , either bolus intracoronary injection morphine sulfate saline 1:1 ratio . Randomization stratify infarct location ( anterior vs. non-anterior ) , morphine use pain control study enroll ( intracoronary morphine ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticagrelor Intracoronary Morphine Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.1 . Ticagrelor versus Clopidogrel 1 . In spite timely successful reperfusion primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , mortality rate still remain high1 substantial number patient suffer subsequent leave ventricular dysfunction heart failure ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . 2 . One limitation primary PCI distal embolization effective antiplatelet therapy need patient STEMI . 3 . Clopidogrel representative P2Y12 receptor antagonist show consistent efficacy patient acute coronary syndrome . However , clopidogrel prodrug convert active metabolite inhibit P2Y12 receptor . Therefore , onset effect relatively slow , antiplatelet effect moderate , response clopidogrel show wide individual variability . 4 . Ticagrelor new , direct , reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist , rapid potent antiplatelet effect . In patient acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation , treatment ticagrelor compare clopidogrel significantly reduce rate death vascular cause , myocardial infarction , stroke without increase rate overall major bleeding . 5 . However , data whether ticagrelor reduce infarct size compare clopidogrel patient undergoing primary PCI . 1.2 . Intracoronary morphine administration 1 . Lethal reperfusion injury account 50 % final size myocardial infarct.5,6 Therefore , adjunctive therapy effective preventing lethal reperfusion injury need potentiate benefit primary PCI . 2 . During past decade , large number animal study demonstrate commonly used opioids could provide cardioprotection ischemia-reperfusion injury . Opioid-induced precondition postconditioning mimic ischemic precondition ischemic postconditioning . 3 . Recent small clinical trial demonstrate cardioprotective effect remote ischemic preconditioning morphine primary PCI . But study small demonstrate separate effect morphine-induced cardioprotection . 2 . Study Objective 1 . To investigate effect ticagrelor myocardial infarct size patient STEMI undergo primary PCI compare clopidogrel 2 . To investigate effect morphine-induced cardioprotection primary PCI patient STEMI</detailed_description>
