	<brief_title>Coffee Metabolic Health Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coffee major source phenolic acid chlorogenic acid substantial source trigonelline , niacin , lignans magnesium , potassium . Several compound show improve glucose metabolism animal model . Consumption coffee inversely associate risk type-2 diabetes prospective cohort study across world . Consumption 3 4 cup coffee per day associate approximately 25 % low risk type-2 diabetes . However , direct evidence efficacy coffee reduce blood glucose insulin resistance parameter human randomized trial still lack . In recent small trial short duration ( 6 week ) coffee consumption increase level insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin , significantly improve insulin sensitivity These result suggest large longer-term trial effect coffee consumption directly measure insulin sensitivity warrant .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Insulin Resistance</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Subjects classify insulinresistant screen visit . Subjects nondiabetic fast plasma glucose concentration ( &lt; 7.0 mM ) HOMAIR &gt; 2.2 . The HOMAIR demonstrate reliable indicator insulin resistance strongly correlate value obtain clamp ( 4 ) . The cutoff value HOMAIR define accord data obtain Singapore cohort . It correspond 75th percentile population . The HOMAIR cutoff subsequently revise ≥ 1.3 increase recruitment rate . Age : ≥ 35 ≤ 69 year old Body mass index : ≥ 22.5 ≤ 35.4 kg/m2 Users least 1 cup caffeinated coffee per day willing randomized intervention . Subjects willing stop consuming caffeinated soft drink supplement study drink coffee nondairy creamer . Nonsmokers ( &lt; 1 cigarette per week ) Participants weight stable least 8 week precede screen visit ( ± 2.5 kg ) . Chinese , Malay Indian ethnicity Subjects represent one follow criterion exclude participation study : Any condition/illness may affect study outcome would make participation potentially harmful pregnancy breastfeeding , diabetes mellitus , heart disease , stroke , hypertension , malabsorption syndrome , GERD , history ulcer , clot bleed disorder , allergy test beverage , allergy insulin , accord detailed medical history . Participants allergic food may exclude base investigator 's discretion . Participants consume &gt; 2 alcoholic servings/day regular basis &gt; 8 caffeinated serving ( base tea coffee ) /day Present drug abuse use medication could interfere treatment include bronchodilator , quinolone antibiotic , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , anxiolytic , ranitidine , corticosteroid , growth hormone , antihypertensive . These condition screen base subject reporting . Participants ask bring current medication time screening , check studystaff . Subject take traditional medication , herbal dietary supplement may affect study outcome opinion investigator . Subject expect comply study procedure opinion investigator . Currently participate participate another clinical trial last 12 week prior begin study . Premenopausal woman selfreported irregular menstrual cycle perimenopausal woman ( participant stop get menses less 48 week ) .</criteria>
