	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) highly prevalent disable disease . It estimate 2030 prevalence symptomatic OA could reach 30 % population 60 year . It associate significant morbidity one common cause joint pain , functional disability compromise quality life . This randomise controlled trial investigate effect low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) static stretching exercise , monotherapy combination , pain , quality life , function , mobility , knee range motion ( KROM ) hamstring length participant knee OA . This study involve 145 people age 50-75 year symptomatic radiographic knee OA consist two type treatment : Low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) stretch exercise . The patient randomly allocate five study group LLLT active+Stretch , LLLT placebo+Stretch , Stretch , LLLT Control ( n=29 ) . Treatment frequency three sessions/week active group . LLLT involve use Galium-Arsenide laser ( 904nm , 40 milliwatt , 3 Joules/point , 27 Joules/knee ) 24 session monotherapy group 9 session LLLT+Stretch group . Stretching consist seven exercise complete 24 session . The control group receive booklet . The primary outcome pain measure Visual Analogue Scale . Secondary outcome include quality life assess Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) , function Lequesne Algofunctional Index , mobility Timed Up Go Test ( TUG ) , KROM goniometry knee flexion hamstring shorten popliteal angle . The statistical method follow principle per-protocol analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical performance determinant disability osteoarthritis ( OA ) investigate extensively , research focus primarily effect decrease muscle strength functionality patient OA . However , reduce range motion affect joint also important risk factor occurrence locomotor disability develop disability patient OA . Studies use stretch exercise scarce Reid &amp; Mc Nair ( 2010 ) specifically examine range motion improve subject knee osteoarthritis , although study stretch hamstring . The result indicate immediate benefit stretch subject osteoarthritis knee joint , provide evidence long term development stretch program population . In literature observe inconsistent result regard benefit laser treatment improve pain function individual knee OA . Also study specify dosage frequency laser must use . In view increase need support role physiotherapy evidence-based practice , study justify need test effectiveness stretch exercise elucidate effectiveness low intensity laser therapy patient knee OA .</detailed_description>
