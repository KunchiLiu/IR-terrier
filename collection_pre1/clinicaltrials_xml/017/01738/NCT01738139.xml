	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination ipilimumab imatinib give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Ipilimumab design increase immune system 's ability fight cancer . Imatinib design bind certain protein tumor cell , may prevent cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Imatinib Mesylate Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : Dose Escalation Group : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level study drug combination base join study . Up 4 dose level study drug combination test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . Dose Expansion Group : After high tolerable dose level study drug combination find , 20 additional participant enrol dose expansion group . Patients metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , melanoma , tumor original tumor biopsy test positive KIT mutation ( cancer biomarker ) eligible enroll receive high dose study drug combination tolerate dose escalation group . Study Drug Administration : If Dose Escalation Group , first study cycle 35 day . Each cycle 21 day . If Dose Expansion Group , study cycle 21 day . If Dose Escalation Group , start take imatinib mouth 1 time day 14 day receive ipilimumab . On Day 15 cycle , receive single dose ipilimumab vein 90 minute . You continue take imatinib mouth 1 time day . If Dose Expansion Group , receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 cycle . You also take imatinib mouth 1 time day cycle . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . - Urine collect routine test . - You EKG . Every 3-4 week Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You EKG . On Day 15 Cycles 2 4 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . Starting Cycle 2 : - You CT MRI scan every 2 cycle check status disease . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test month . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treatment unresectable metastatic melanoma . Imatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment advance metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) . The combination ipilimumab imatinib currently use research purpose . Up 96 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . For dose escalation study , patient must histological confirmation solid tumor metastatic unresectable . For expansion cohort , patient must metastatic unresectable GIST , melanoma , uncategorized tumor tumor biopsy positive cKIT mutation polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . For patient enrolled melanoma expansion cohort , select KIT mutation eligible . Patients mutation exon 13 V654X , 14 T6701 , 17 D816X exon 18 mutation eligible enrollment . 2 . Patients complete previous therapy 4weeks prior ( within 5 drug half life ) enrollment study . Radiation therapy wash period 2 week . This include exception patient metastatic GIST tumor take maintenance imatinib mesylate therapy . These patient allow remain imatinib mesylate therapy enrollment study . 3 . Age &gt; = 15 year 4 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . 5 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL ; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL , total bilirubin &lt; = 2.0 mg/dL . ( Does NOT apply patient Gilbert 's Syndrome ) ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( patient liver involvement allow &lt; = 5.0 X institutional upper normal limit ) serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL 6 . Patients MUST recover treatment related toxicity Grade 1 NCI CTCAE ( v 4.0 ) severity 7 . Patients must willing able review , understand , provide write consent start therapy 8 . Patients histologically prove intracranial glioblastoma , gliosarcoma anaplastic astrocytoma eligible . Patients must show unequivocal radiographic evidence tumor progression MRI scan . A scan performed within 14 day prior registration steroid dose stable least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI require . 9 . Patients expansion cohort must also agree participate immunotherapy platform protocol ( PA130291 ) . 10 . Patients must willing stay within 2 hour drive MD Anderson Cancer Center whilst receive Ipilimumab therapy . Patient must also agree present MD Anderson emergency center Ipilimumab therapy . 1 . Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease ( include Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) autoimmune disorder rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] exclude study . 2 . History acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , GI obstruction , abdominal carcinomatosis know risk factor bowel perforation . 3 . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation Adverse Events ( AEs ) : e.g . condition associate frequent diarrhea chronic skin condition , recent surgery colonic biopsy patient recover , partial endocrine organ deficiency . 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , history congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 5 . Known HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C. 6 . Any nononcology live vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( one month prior dose ipilimumab ) . 7 . Concomitant therapy following : IL2 , interferon nonstudy immunotherapy regimens ; cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunosuppressive agent ; investigational therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid ( used management cancer intracranial glioblastoma , gliosarcoma anaplastic astrocytoma , use treat noncancerrelated illness ) . 8 . Patients agree practice appropriate birth control method therapy . 9 . Pregnant woman exclude study . Women childbearing potential men must agree use contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician .</criteria>
