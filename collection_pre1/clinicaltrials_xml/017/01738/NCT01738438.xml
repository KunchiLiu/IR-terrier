	<brief_summary>In research study , look anti-tumor effect Cabozantinib ( XL184 ) metastatic breast cancer . Data suggest MET expression activation important initiation progression triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . We evaluate efficacy cabozantinib ( XL184 ) , novel inhibitor multiple receptor tyrosine kinase , include MET VEGFR2 , patient metastatic TNBC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Metastatic Triple Negative BrCa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary * To evaluate activity cabozantinib , define objective response rate patient triple-negative metastatic breast cancer Secondary - To evaluate progression free survival - To evaluate c-Met phospho c-Met expression archival tumor tissue - To evaluate incidence c-Met amplified circulate tumor cell baseline - To evaluate potential plasma biomarkers cabozantinib DESIGN : This study use two-stage design enrol 35 patient evaluate efficacy cabozantinib base overall response define complete partial response per RECIST1.1 criterion . The null alternative overall response rate 5 % 20 % . If one patient enrol stage one cohort ( n=13 patient ) achieve PR well accrual proceeds stage two ( n=22 patient ) .</detailed_description>
