	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I trial study side effect best dose carfilzomib give together without romidepsin treat patient stage IA-IVB cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Carfilzomib romidepsin may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give carfilzomib alone effective give together romidepsin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Trial Carfilzomib With Without Romidepsin Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) carfilzomib , single agent well combination romidepsin , patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall response rate ( ORR ) . II . Duration response . III . Time progression ( TTP ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure proteasome activity concurrently peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) tumor tissue biopsy specimen order gather pilot data proteasome inhibition CTCL patient treat carfilzomib alone well carfilzomib romidepsin . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study carfilzomib . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . ARM B : Patients receive carfilzomib Arm A romidepsin IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day least 2-4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
