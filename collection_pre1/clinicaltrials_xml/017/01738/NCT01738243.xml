	<brief_summary>Thyroid eye disease ( TED ) autoimmune disease affect eye area . The disease present variety physical finding , include bulge eye ( proptosis ) , upper low eyelid retraction , swelling/inflammation eye . The disease pass two phase : active inactive . The active phase last 18 24 month . During phase , TED sign symptom generally worsen often improve . The inactive phase follow , sign symptom TED cease improve usually stabilize . Lid retraction cardinal sign TED . In addition potentially cause cornea damage due improper lid closure , lid retraction also troublesome patient due cosmetic appearance . The precise pathophysiology lid retraction poorly understood , lead hypothesis occurs due scar fibrosis muscle lift eyelid . Currently , definitive treatment lid retraction surgery , use lengthen lid remove inflame tissue behind eye , thus cause eye bulge less . In case patient first present physician corneal ulceration compression optic nerve , surgery may perform immediately . However , instance , surgical procedure delay active stage disease pass . Thus , patient must endure cosmetic irritant symptom TED two year . Hyaluronic Acid Gels ( HAG ) FDA approve treatment facial rhytids ( wrinkle ) . They inject skin work increase volume . Recently , small retrospective research study show HAG also effective correct upper low eyelid retraction TED . Hence , HAG may patient active stage TED . It also think employed early active phase disease , HAG may also help decrease severity associate symptom reduce need surgery . The purpose current investigation define clinical utility HAG correction upper eyelid active TED term anatomic ( lid position ) , quantitative ( corneal dry eye sign ) qualitative effect ( symptom severity thyroid relate quality life ) .</brief_summary>
