	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop vibratory self-trainer treatment dysphagia post-stroke . The aim identify optimal stimulation characteristic use participant swallow problem include : - Frequency vibration - Mode vibration either continuous pulse - Pressure device neck - Duration vibration allow participant initiate swallow</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Passy Muir Swallowing Self Training Device Enhance Recovery Post Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate use self-training device improve swallow post-stroke . The device motor place neck side thyroid cartilage provide noninvasive vibratory stimulation . The vibration penetrate neck tissue larynx activate mechanoreceptors innervate internal branch superior laryngeal nerve , stimulate trigger swallow brain stem level . The outcome research use develop device use patient daily swallow self-training environment . Site monitor audit conduct crucial time point study , include prior participant enrollment . Auditing conduct Julie Kobak , Vice President Clinical Education Passy Muir , Inc . Source data verification compare raw data form electronic case report form . Standard operate procedure place participant recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event . Sample size assessment : Based previous study healthy volunteer contrast air puff stimulation rate swallowing ( 1 , 2 ) expect change rate swallow 1.2 swallows/minute without stimulation 2.0 swallows/minute stimulation standard deviation difference 0.9 . Using Bonferroni correct alpha 0.025 ( test 2 measure ) 0.80 power effect size 0.88 , number participant need 15 per experiment . Allowing participant participate several study , investigator plan recruit 30 40 participant risk aspiration post stroke . Potential problem alternative strategy : Anticipated problem include difficulty recruit adequate sample . There 3 room available participant test Rockingham Memorial Hospital support multiple participant test simultaneously . Furthermore , equipment portable include Powerlab , laptop , amplifier system , Kistler accelerometer , Inductive plethysmography participant test rehabilitation setting and/or home .
