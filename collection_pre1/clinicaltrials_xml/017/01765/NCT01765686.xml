	<brief_title>Comparing Harmonic Ultrasonic Scalpel Small Jaw Bipolar Device Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Energy device use routinely thyroid surgery aid surgical dissection haemostasis . The new generation energy device several advantage old machine . First , new device deliver focus thermal application thus less likely cause collateral injury surround healthy tissue . This particularly relevant thyroid surgery thyroid gland close proximity vital nerve control airway gland regulate calcium metabolism . Secondly , new energy device multifunctional property capable sealing , blunt dissection , grasp divide tissue . This advantageous thyroid surgery operate field many narrow area within potential reduction exchange instrument facilitate surgery . Currently , two new generation energy device available use Singapore General Hospital National Cancer Centre Singapore . Both device similarly price ; one base ultrasonic vibrate blade ( UCSD ) cut coagulate tissue use bipolar electrical energy pressure form seal micro blade divide seal tissue ( EBVS ) . To date , clinical study compare device do animal model focus seal time animal blood vessel . We aim compare effectiveness two new generation energy device thyroid surgery look incidence post surgical complication , post operative drainage well ease use reflect operating time .</detailed_description>
