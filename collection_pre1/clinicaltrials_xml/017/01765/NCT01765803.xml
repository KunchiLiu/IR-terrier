	<brief_summary>This study investigate possibility use drug thioridazine ( also call Mellaril ) increase number certain type cell move bone marrow circulation group healthy human . The type cell hope collect call CD34+ progenitor , stem cell . These cell use laboratory well understand number disease suggest new strategy therapy . Perhaps important potential application human stem cell generation cell tissue could use cell-based therapy , renewable source replacement cell tissue treat disease include Alzheimer 's disease , spinal cord injury , stroke , burn , heart disease , diabetes , osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Thioridazine Mobilizing Agent CD34+ Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , feasibility study test whether single dose Mellaril ( thioridazine HCL ) able effectively mobilize CD34+ cell set health human subject . This study involve use placebo , subject serve control CD34+ cell mobilization . We hypothesize single dose Mellaril ( thioridazine HCL ) mobilize CD34+ progenitor cell human peripheral blood factor least 10 fold , 4 40 cells/microliter .</detailed_description>
