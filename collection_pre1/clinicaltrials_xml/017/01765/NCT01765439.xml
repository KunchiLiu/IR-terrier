	<brief_title>The Effect VSL # 3 Probiotic Preparation Bile Acid Metabolism Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VSL # 3 ( Original De Simone formulation , abbreviate VSL # 3 ) , potent probiotic preparation , test adjuvant therapy inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , chronic unspecific inflammatory disorder gastrointestinal tract ( frequent form IBD Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) ) . VSL # 3 show improve symptom IBD animal model humans-the impressive result observe prevent pouchitis UC patient . Several possible mechanism action suggest , include change gut microbial diversity , immunomodulatory function ( upregulation interleukine-10 ) , etc. , however , list probably far complete . Bile acid ( BA ) play important role gastrointestinal tract - besides facilitate fat ( protein ) digestion resorption , act general antimicrobial agent within small intestine ( maintain small intestine less microbe-free ) , colonic microflora modifier , intestinal innate immunity regulator , importantly signal molecule liver-intestine/intestine-liver axis . Under pathological condition ( BA malabsorption ) BA worsen IBD symptom ( namely diarrhoea ) , irritate colonic mucosa induce colonic secretion electrolyte . The study hypothesis beneficial effect VSL # 3 might partially explain alteration BA metabolism . There exist complex crosstalk gut microflora BA : BA affect microbial growth , whereas BA structure modify bacteria ( deconjugation , 7 α dehydroxylation ) . Several observation might support hypothesis : VSL # 3 ameliorates symptom radiation chemotherapy induce diarrhoea , well diarrhoea critically ill patient - condition , cause BA malabsorption . Similarly , oxalate absorption ( closely relate BA malabsorption ) show lowered VSL # 3 . The main question address propose study , therefore , whether VSL # 3 administration somehow change metabolism bile acid ( BA ) . Additionally , urinary metabolite level strongly influence difference intestinal microbiota , since gut bacterial metabolism , share metabolism host bacterial specie ( 'co-metabolism ' ) , generate specific metabolic product . Such metabolite may therefore use marker microbial metabolic activity , reflect systemic , functional difference . This application urinary metabolic profile avoids technical difficulty , methodological difference , find molecular study intestinal microbiota IBD , contribute often discrepant finding . Specific urinary metabolite relate gut microbial metabolism differ CD patient , UC patient , control . The emerge technique urinary NMR-based metabolic profile multivariate analysis able distinguish cohort . This study address question , whether VSL # 3 administration change nuclear magnetic resonance-based urinary metabolomic profile .</detailed_description>
