	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) cure many hematologic disease . Although great progress make prevention treatment side effect associate transplantation , chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) remain important complication occur 50 % patient . The mortality cGVHD complication could reach 50 % , cGVHD seriously influence quality life . At present , glucocorticoid cyclosporine ( CsA ) first line treatment cGVHD , effective rate 50 % . If first line treatment ineffective , second line drug would take , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) rituximab . The effective rate second line drug 30 % -61 % . The effective rate prognosis refractory cGVHD even bad . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) form multipotent adult stem cell isolate bone marrow ( BM ) , adipose tissue , cord blood . Clinical application human MSCs evolve rapidly goal improve hematopoietic engraftment , prevent treat GVHD allo-HSCT . However , efficacy treatment refractory cGVHD use expand BM-derived MSCs third-party donor rarely report . If treatment could show effective safe , BM-derived MSCs could potentially use universal donor material . This would major impact generation donor-specific MSCs time-consuming , costly , often impractical clinical status patient urgent . In present study , investigator prospectively evaluate efficacy safety ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs third-party donor treat patient refractory cGVHD .</detailed_description>
