	<brief_summary>Project description Research project title : Influence moderate exercise blood glucose type 2 diabetic healthy control . Project description objective Obesity widespread Denmark 47 % population class overweight ( BMI &gt; =25 ) around 13 % population class obese ( BMI &gt; =30 ) . The strong correlation obesity type 2 diabetes ( least 2/3 type 2 diabetic overweight ) lead many study look different form exercise group , weight loss may improve diabetes even defer onset disorder low complication increase long term survival . For people type 2 diabetes , work-induced increase sympathetic activity lead suppress insulin secretion increase glucagon secretion . This increase endogenous glucose production liver thus maintain normal concentration blood sugar physical training situation demand glucose increase . The theory behind project mechanism help increase glucose production liver physical activity weaker type 2 diabetic , cause hypoglycaemia physical exercise . In word , want study liver 's sensitivity stimulus physical work patient type 2 diabetes relevant healthy control subject . Previous study indicate type mechanism intact type 2 diabetic ; level insulin fall expect physical training . However , exist study measure liver 's glucose secretion use stable isotope prolong moderate physical work . Measuring help clarify understand glucose homeostasis type 2 diabetic . This study relevant , may expect preferred form physical exercise overweight type 2 diabetic moderate intensity previous study also show form physical exercise delivers health gain term improvement insulin sensitivity reduction level insulin . The objective study determine level blood glucose stay constant , physical training examine liver 's ability secret glucose accordingly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design A group 20 people type 2 diabetes 10 control subject twice invite laboratory , respectively . The type 2 diabetes group consist 10 individual treat metformin 10 individual treat Metformin . The latter group may diet-treated diabetic diabetic stop take oral antidiabetic agent 72 hour day experiment . On first visit , follow carry : - DXA scan , blood pressure measurement , determination ECG VO2-max cycleergometer - Blood sample - Questionnaire everyday physical activity ( I-PAQ ) On second visit , follow carry : - 3 day carbohydrate loading prior day . ( By diet recommendation ) . - Insertion arterial cannula , blood sample extraction . - Insertion venus cannula . Insertion stable glucose isotope period 4.5 hour : 2,5 hour relaxation bed follow 45 minute cycle exercise bicycle ( continue isotope infusion ) 60 % maximum heart rate reserve , measured test day 1 . Followed relaxation continue blood sample isotope infusion , one hour cycling cease . Inclusion criterion - Age 30 60 year old , - Maximum oxygen consumption 20 50 ml/kg/minute , - BMI 25 35 kg/m2 , - Normal ECG , - Must stable weight throughout last three month normal balance diet , - Can cycle 45 minute Exclusion criterion - For patient type 2 diabetes : insulin treatment , - ECG indicate cardiovascular disease , - Illness medicine may affect result , - On-going weight loss diet DXA scan Minimal radiation - The scan last six 10 minute total radiation dose measure 0.01 mSv ( millisievert ) . This approximately equivalent natural daily background exposure . Cycling test Prior test , ECG carry person quiz his/her state health . Regarding experiment , quick access doctor laboratory . The laboratory equip defibrillator . Infusion stable glucose isotope Stable glucose isotope occur naturally body , though much small amount . They radioactive require special precaution . Blood sample An arterial cannula insert , blood sample subsequently take . A sample immediately analyse ( ABL analyser ) glucose lactate concentration blood gas , Hgb Hct . Other blood sample process centrifuge plasma frozen - 80 Â°C analyse . The plasma analyse determine concentration : Insulin , glucagon , cortisol , growth hormone ( GH ) , adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) , C-peptide , catecholamine , alanin , concentration ketone , cholesterol free fatty acid , glycerol , glucose isotope ( Ra ) content , cycling . The biological material ( form plasma ) store freezer . When experiment complete , material analysed laboratory . When analysis carry , excess material destroy . All material store anonymously . Ethical consideration At time , study carry accordance late Helsinki current Danish legislation . Among thing , include voluntary participation test subject withdraw consent time without provide explanation . The study protocol write patient information submit Research Ethics Committee Capital Region Denmark Danish Data Protection Agency inform . Patient inclusion begin write approval receive institution . Both positive , negative inconclusive result must publish .</detailed_description>
