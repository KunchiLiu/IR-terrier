Aim : To assess whether NICaS system identify high risk HF patient readmission prior discharge compare serum BNP measurement.Methods population : Known HF patient , admit due HF exacerbation , test NICaS system concordance serum BNP measurement prior discharge hospital . The decision discharge make clinical ground treat physician alone . The patient test NICaS system follow manner-patches attached patient 's wrist , one wrist contra-lateral ankle period approximately 30 second . During time patient seat supine.3cc blood drawn peripheral vein BNP level measurement.NICaS parameter serum BNP level process excel sheet . The patient follow telephone questionnaire 3 month discharge order document event readmission death .</detailed_description>
