	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) 'inflammatory ' demyelinate disease , also include axonal neuronal injury grey matter . Neurodegenerative process partly independent lesion formation relapse activity , represent direct driver clinical long-term disability cognitive decline . Multimodal evoke potential ( EP ) , i.e . combination visual , somato-sensory motor EP ( VEP , SSEP , MEP ) show prospectively provide objective , monovectorial , numerical data closely correlated EDSS . As EP capture functional integrity examine system represent method unbiased directional change , remain specific neuronal function , hence measure deterioration , well improvement , germane advantage capture drug response . High-resolution electroencephalography ( EEG ) allow explorative analysis potential surrogate marker cognitive decline . Ocrelizumab ( OCR ) , humanize anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody show strong treatment effect number T1Gd-enhancing lesion , new T1Gd-enhancing new T2-hyperintense lesion well annualized relapse rate recent phase II trial relapsing-remitting MS . The present study investigate effect OCR multimodal evoke potential ( EP ) , Furthermore , quantitative EEG potential correlate cognitive dysfunction fatigue explore .</brief_summary>
