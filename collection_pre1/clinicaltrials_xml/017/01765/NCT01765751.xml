	<brief_title>Manual Cervical Distraction : Measuring Chiropractic Delivery Neck Pain Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Manual Cervical Distraction ( MCD ) : Measuring Chiropractic Delivery Neck Pain Clinical Trial examine patient‐centered clinical biomechanical outcome , believability characteristic manually‐localized cervical distraction procedure treatment neck- neck-related arm pain disability . One challenge issue study manual therapy , include spinal manipulation ( SM ) , development sham and/or minimal intervention procedure suitable use control group clinical trial . With SM , active treatment require substantial physical contact study clinician study participant , either directly mechanical intermediary . Consequently , difficult introduce difference manual therapy procedure distinguish sham and/or minimal intervention active treatment , immediately obvious study participant . Another challenge issue train clinician deliver standardize SM treatment within specify force range . The muscle surround neck could alter force transmit cervical spine , could alter treatment effectiveness . The purpose pilot randomize controlled trial examine patient‐centered clinical , biomechanical , believability outcome characteristic manually‐localized cervical distraction procedure treatment neck neck-related arm pain disability . We also evaluate ability doctor chiropractic deliver MCD treatment within specify force range . An exploratory aim study evaluate EMG measurement MCD delivery .</detailed_description>
