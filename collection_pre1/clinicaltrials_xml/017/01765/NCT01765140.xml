	<brief_title>Treatment Use 3,4-Diaminopyridine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis LEMS CMS make base clinical electromyographic finding , patient refer PI DAP treatment . This study enroll minor adult . CMS patient age 18 year include parent guardian give write permission . Minors turn 18 program re-consented adult . The dose DAP determine individually patient . Adults start dose 10 mg 3-4 time daily , increase several week dose produce maximum symptomatic response , exceed 100 mg daily . Pyridostigmine bromide ( PB ) may add low dos , increase dose produce best response , exceed 360 mg daily . In child , equivalent dos medication give calculate surface area basis . The dos DAP PB periodically adjust assure small effective dos use . Patients achieve significant clinical benefit DAP , judge study PI patient , may continue take DAP long drug available sponsor , long return regular follow-up evaluation Duke MG Clinic . Patients unable return regular follow-up require local physician obtain DAP sponsor .</detailed_description>
