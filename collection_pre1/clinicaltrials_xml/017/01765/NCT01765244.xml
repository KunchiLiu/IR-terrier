	<brief_summary>Phase I- II clinical trial evaluate feasibility method absence relevant side effect derive product implant . HYPOTHESIS : Once design nanostructured artificial human cornea Tissue Engineering Group University Granada , evaluate suitable property ex vivo vivo utility mean anterior lamellar keratoplasty laboratory animal , necessary proceed clinical evaluation human patient suffer severe corneal pathology . The result obtain pre-clinical study , laboratory experimental animal , suggest nanostructured artificial human cornea could help treat various corneal disease occur substance loss serious structural alteration , relevant side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Tissue Engineering ( Nanostructured Artificial Human Cornea ) Patients With Corneal Trophic Ulcers Advanced Stages , Refractory Conventional ( Ophthalmic ) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I-II , control , randomize , multicenter clinical trial . The total number patient include 20 . In initial phase , include 5 patient sequentially ( subjected experimental treatment ) , month half safety period patient . At random , 5 patient implanted cornea 10 control patient receive amniotic membrane transplant conventional treatment corneal trophic ulcer advance stage . The study population consist patient severe corneal pathology ( corneal ulcer refractory conventional trophic treatment sequel previous ulcer stromal fibrosis / limbal failure eye ) , n't currently effective alternative therapeutic It estimate inclusion period approximately 36 month , follow-up period 24 month patient . Thus total duration study 60 month inclusion first patient end follow-up period last patient include . To patient enrol trial , assign experimental group proceed implant anterior lamellar nanostructured artificial cornea allogeneic cell dead donor biomaterials . The implant Advanced Therapy drug cover defect structural alteration exist affected cornea . In phase study , aim assess feasibility procedure biosafety implant graft patient 's cornea . Patients randomize control group subject usual treatment condition , consist amniotic membrane transplantation Once artificial corneal graft amniotic membrane transplantation affect eye complete , proceed monitor continuous assessment subject . For , use usual revision method use anterior pole eyeball hospital involve study . Main objective : To evaluate safety , feasibility evidence clinical efficacy anterior lamellar nanostructured artificial human cornea model , group patient severe corneal disease , currently effective therapeutic alternative . Secondary objective : - To generate lamellar nanostructured artificial human cornea allogeneic origin dead donor , sclerocorneal limbus agarose-fibrin biomaterials . - To implant nanostructured artificial human cornea allogeneic origin dead donor group patient randomize experimental group , suffer severe corneal pathology graft wound bed . - To assess Biosecurity nanostructured artificial human cornea allogeneic origin dead donor implant patient rule relevant adverse reaction .</detailed_description>
