	<brief_summary>HM71224 potent small molecule inhibitor Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . BTK member Tec family non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase . BTK mostly express hematopoietic cell B cell , mast cell macrophage . BTK play key role multiple cell signal pathway include B-Cell Receptor ( BCR ) Fc receptor ( FcR ) signal cascade essential mediator B-cell dependent also myeloid cell dependent inflammatory arthritis . HM71224 select novel therapeutic agent treatment autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . In view , development HM71224 treatment RA warrant . In first-in-man ( FIM ) study , single multiple dose escalation design employ , primary objective evaluate safety tolerability compound . The biomarkers include pharmacodynamic ( PD ) variables choose indicator effect HM71224 expect mode action ( pBTK , pPLCγ , pERK ) .</brief_summary>
