	<brief_summary>This randomize , open-label , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety folinic acid ( leucovorin ) , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ( FOLFOXIRI ) / bevacizumab regimen ( concurrent sequential ) versus folinic acid ( leucovorin ) , 5-fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) / bevacizumab first-line participant metastatic colorectal cancer . Participants randomize receive bevacizumab 5 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) intravenously every 2 week either concurrent sequential FOLFOXIRI FOLFOX 4 6 month induction therapy , follow maintenance therapy bevacizumab plus either leucovorin/5-fluorouracil capecitabine disease progression occur . After disease progression , participant receive treatment fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
