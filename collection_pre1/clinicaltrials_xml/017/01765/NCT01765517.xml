	<brief_summary>Probiotics , believe health promote live microorganism , report influence circulate endotoxin level . Ingestion live culture may alter gut mircobiota beneficial manner reduce inflammation ; although mechanism influence reduce inflammation T2DM establish disease state . Therefore , aim study ( 1 ) characterize beneficial effect probiotic circulate endotoxin level biomarkers related systemic low-grade inflammation patient T2DM ; ( 2 ) Compare circulate endotoxin level inflammatory cytokine level patient treat probiotic placebo examine beneficial effect probiotic reduce inflammatory status , assessment systemic marker ( adipokines , endotoxin , cytokine ) ; ( 3 ) examine effect probiotic gut microflora order understand mechanism change inflammatory status . To achieve , 120 consent adult Saudis , naïve newly diagnose T2DM patient without co-morbidities , enrol clinical trial randomize receive twice-daily placebo probiotic 26 week double-blind manner . Glycemic inflammatory marker measure fecal sample analyse , intervention do baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 26 week . It envisage probiotic induce beneficial change gut mircobiota , reduce systemic inflammatory state alter systemic endotoxin level , , reduce systemic inflammatory response observe T2DM subject . This fundamental impact treat inflammatory component T2DM , particularly result verify large cohort patient , could dramatic effect treat patient T2DM . Reducing pathogenesis T2DM dampen inflammatory response , may also impact insulin resistance status health individual , clear benefit . This could profound effect preventative T2DM management , well current T2DM care without excessive cost wider Saudi health economy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Explore Effects Probiotics Endotoxin Levels Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design In 26-week , single-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study , 60 patient T2DM treat probiotic 60 treat placebo . Interventions do week 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 26 subject . Patients allocate probiotic group receive capsule contain four strain freeze-dried bacteria , namely Lactobacillus acidophilus , Lactobacillus bulgaricus , Bifidobacterium bifidum , Streptococcus thermophiles ( Bio-plus® , Supherb , Israel ) , daily dose 2 × 1010 CFU . Participants placebo group receive capsule contain wheat-based non-fermentable fiber , use another clinical trial [ Pereg et al , 2011 ] . Recruitment Patients Recruitment patient study make possible collaboration primary care center throughout Riyadh Biomarkers Research Program , College Science , King Saud University . Inclusion Criteria - Stable well control T2DM ( HbA1c &lt; 7.5 % change oral antidiabetic medication last 6 month ) - Age 20-75 year - Provision write informed consent Exclusion Criteria - Chronic gastrointestinal disease ( except IBS ) - Systemic antibiotic within 6 week inclusion - Use probiotic within 3 month inclusion ( Appendix A list product currently market internationally available purchase Saudi Arabia ) - Regular intake insulin insulin analog , antibiotic probiotic , antacid , H2-receptor blocker , proton pump inhibiters , loperamide , cholestryramine , ω3 supplement , fibrates , corticosteroid sex steroid - Daily alcohol consumption &gt; 30 g - Significant immunodeficiency - Known cardiac valvular disease - Breast-feeding pregnant - Non-Arab ethnicity - Participation another clinical trial within last 6 month - Legal incapability Allocation Treatment After confirmation eligibility obtain write informed consent , patient give unique subject number probiotic company , also perform randomization ( stratified gender ) , The patient clinicians primary care center blind treatment receive . The eligible patient allocate ( 1:1 ) treatment 26 week either probiotic supplement placebo . Subjects instruct - Ingest 1 capsule breakfast 1 capsule even meal , either directly mixed standard yoghurt . - The capsule store refrigerator jar open . Data Handling Record Keeping Case report form ( CRF ) use record data participant , complete research nurse , also enter data electronic database . Study schedule location After inclusion , treatment manage primary care center subject recruit ( see appendix C schedule visit ) . A research nurse research dietician responsible contact patient . Doctors associate research team available problem arise . Acquisition Clinical Data Assessment Compliance - Medical history , include presence chronic disease , regular medication , smoke alcohol habit , record inclusion . - Nutritional habit assess use standardized 14-day recall questionnaire , discuss dietician - Changes medication study period record - Anthropometric measurement make use standardized method . Height measure start treatment . Weight ( light clothing without shoe item pocket ) , waist circumference ( measure horizontal plane level umbilicus ) hip circumference ( measure horizontal plane level trochanter major ) measure start end treatment . - Liver ultrasonography perform either screen start treatment determine presence absence bright liver indicative steatosis . Patients fatty liver liver transaminase &gt; 1.5 × upper limit normal offer referral hepatologist . - Compliance monitor week 4 , 8 , 12 26 . Patients bring previously receive capsule primary care center calculate mean number capsule ingest per day . Acquisition Routine Biochemical Data Biological Samples - Blood sample obtain analyzed Biomarkers Research Program measure glucose , HbA1c , insulin , C-peptide , total cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase level . - Fasting blood sample collect week 0 , 8 26 . Peripheral venous blood draw pyrogen-free tube without anticoagulant . The tube immediately place ice , allow coagulate , centrifuge ( 2500 ×g 10 min 4°C ) within 2 hour collection . Serum sample store -80°C use . At least two 2-mL serum sample collect time-point . - Stool sample take ask patient store sample plastic sealable bag freezer transfer clinic . ( sample take point request blood sample . Once clinic , sample divide , flash frozen , store -80°C . Changes gut microbiota profile use signature-tagged sequencing ( pyrosequencing ) amplify 16S rRNA gene follow automated bioinformatics analysis . Targeted RT-PCR also use examine bacterial specie Enterobacteria Bifdobacteria relative universal bacterial primer set . Pyrosequencing RT-PCR perform sub-cohort ( n=15 ) patient consider final systemic finding . Samples retain subsequent study . Subject Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw trial time request , may withdraw time discretion investigator safety , behavioral administrative reason . The subject also withdraw study case : - Treatment systemic antibiotic &gt; 1 week week 0-22 - Any use systemic antibiotic week 22-26 Patient Safety Adverse Events Adverse event ( AEs ) undesirable sign symptom occur study may may causally relate treatment . All AEs consider possibly , probably definitely related test product record CRFs . Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) define event fatal , life-threatening , disabling , incapacitate result hospitalization prolong hospital stay , result malformation . All SAEs record CRF , whether related test product . According previous study ( 9 ) , probiotic safe , SAE might possibly , probably definitely related test product regard unexpected . All unexpected SAEs report immediately Medicines Healthcare product Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) . Any SAE might relate test immediately lead discontinuation test product . Ethical Regulatory Aspects The study perform accordance protocol ethical principle origin Declaration Helsinki well International Council Harmonization Guidance Good Clinical Practice . These document state inform consent subject essential precondition participation clinical study . The study commence obtain approval local ethical review board College Medicine Research Center , King Saud University . Plan Data Analyses As trial design assess physiological effect rather support clinical indication treatment probiotic T2DM , plan perform per protocol analysis . Only subject treat least 80 % plan dos least 80 % time consider treat per protocol . Raw data enter statistical software ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) , SPSS version 16.5 ( Chicago , IL , USA ) . Preparation data set do prior analysis . Descriptive statistic do ; frequency present percentage ( % ) . Continuous variable present mean ± standard deviation . Variables exhibit non-Gaussian variable transform prior analysis . Repeated measure analysis co-variance ( ANCOVA ) use compare group , represent combination analysis variance ( ANOVA ) linear regression . Confounding fixed variable age gender , well BMI take proper matching achieve prior repeat measure . Post-hoc Banjamini-Hohberg correction do multiple comparison . For comparison 2 group , independent T-test do continuous variable Mann-Whitney non-continuous variable . Analysis adverse event ( ) do use Chi-Square test Fisher 's exact test follow assumption randomness , independence size . Significance set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
