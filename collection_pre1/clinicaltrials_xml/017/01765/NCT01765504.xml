	<brief_summary>Using 9 center ( Appendix B ) involve plan multicenter NIRS comparative effectiveness trial specific aim study : 1 . To demonstrate feasibility collect rScO2 data patient undergoing cardiac surgery multicenter study design . 2 .

	<detailed_description>Brain injury cardiac surgery chief source patient mortality healthcare cost significantly impair quality life . Reducing burden complication wide public health implication . The broad manifestation perioperative brain injury include stroke , delirium , cognitive decline.5 All form injury believe result primarily cerebral embolism and/or reduce cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . The risk cerebral hypoperfusion likely high cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) keep low ( ~60 mmHg ) , particularly patient age cerebral vascular disease . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) use increasingly monitor regional cerebral oxygen saturation ( rScO2 ) patient undergo cardiac surgery , although limit data show improve patient outcome . Regardless , clinical evidence support efficacy NIRS-based monitoring need urgently cost NIRS sensor ( ~ $ 220/patient ) could add $ 132 million annually hospital cost cardiac surgery . We must address issue quickly rise prevalence NIRS use advocacy expert industry likely soon result NIRS become standard care . We process submit multicenter , prospectively randomize comparative effectiveness trial ass efficacy NIRS monitoring patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery CPB , and/or valve surgery , risk brain injury . The goal plan proposal determine whether intervention correct rScO2 desaturations ( value &lt; 50 % 20 % reduction room air baseline ) reduce frequency neurologic complication compare standard care ( clinical monitoring ) . In order demonstrate feasibility proposal need demonstrate ability team collect rScO2 data multiple center show ability team properly follow algorithm treat rScO2 desaturations occur surgery . Thus , aim current study collect preliminary data support large comparative effectiveness trial .</detailed_description>
