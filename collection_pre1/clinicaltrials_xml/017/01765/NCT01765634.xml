	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) cure many hematologic disease . Although great progress make prevention treatment side effect associate transplantation , acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) remain important complication occur 35-80 % patient . The mortality aGVHD positively correlate severity . At present , glucocorticoid still first line treatment aGVHD . If glucocorticoids treatment ineffective , second line drug would take , tacrolimus ( FK506 ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) . However , method could continuously effective . The effective rate second line treatment aGVHD 60 % . The effective rate prognosis refractory aGVHD even bad . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) form multipotent adult stem cell isolate bone marrow ( BM ) , adipose tissue , cord blood . Clinical application human MSCs evolve rapidly goal improve hematopoietic engraftment , prevent treat GVHD allo-HSCT . However , efficacy treatment refractory aGVHD use expand BM-derived MSCs third-party donor rarely report . If treatment could show effective safe , BM-derived MSCs could potentially use universal donor material . This would major impact generation donor-specific MSCs time-consuming , costly , often impractical clinical status patient urgent . In present study , investigator prospectively evaluate efficacy safety ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs third-party donor treat patient refractory aGVHD .</detailed_description>
