	<brief_summary>The objective study determine efficacy two form physical therapy training , one emphasizing precise , visually guide walk obstacle target ( Precision Training ) , emphasize mass practice walk treadmill ( Endurance Training ) . The hypothesis visually guide training ( Precision ) may especially efficacious engages motor cortex , whose input may facilitate improvement functional walking . Participants individual chronic ( ≥7 month post-injury ) , motor incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , problem would preclude participation intensive training program . A randomized , single-blinded , cross-over design use randomly allocate participant start Precision Endurance Training , identify Training Phase I . Training 5x/wk 2 month , follow 2-month rest period , identify Rest Period I . Participants return 2-months training method , identify Training Phase II , follow another 2-month rest , Rest Period II . Measures walk speed , distance , skill , confidence , well depression obtain least 3 time train , monthly thereafter . Electrophysiological measure take phase training period rest . Change score use determine phase training rest influence score ( see ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Precision Versus Endurance Training Improve Walking After Chronic Incomplete SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PARTICIPANTS : Inclusion criterion : 1 ) SCI trauma stable lesion , 2 ) injury occur ≥ 7 mo prior , 3 ) able walk independently least 5 walk aid and/or brace , 4 ) injury level C1-L1 , 5 ) able give inform consent , 6 ) able attend training session 5x/week . Exclusion criterion : 1 ) head injury , 2 ) cognitive musculoskeletal impairment preclude participation walk training , 3 ) seizures implant head would preclude participation experiment use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . INTERVENTIONS : Precision Training . Training perform 15 long track . The track contain obstacle target . Obstacles make Styrofoam block 3 cm height , vary width 4 cm 20 cm division 4 cm increment ( must clear without touch ) , target make fabric circle , range diameter 7-10.5 cm ( must totally obscured foot ) . The difficulty track design participant achieve ~80 % success . The emphasis accuracy , speed . Endurance Training . The aim training mass practice . Participants walk treadmill , body-weight support ( BWS ) manual assistance need . The treadmill speed initially set faster ground walk speed measure 10 MWT ( s ) . Participants encourage walk far fast possible minimal rest period . Progression involve reduce manual assistance BWS , increase walk speed distance , reduce rest break . In phase train , research assistant volunteer record training parameter session . The number step execute measured step counter ( StepWatch , Orthocare Innovations , USA ) , confirm accurate simultaneous manual counting prior use , periodically train session . The heart rate immediately bout walk measure heart rate monitor ( Polar FT7 , Polar , Canada ) . The total time , distance walk speed walk bout record . MEASURES : Measures take prior train baseline ( call Baseline I ) end follow interval - one month Training Phase I , two month Training Phase I , one month Rest Period I , two month Rest Period I , one month Training Phase II , two month Training Phase II , one month Rest Period II , two month Rest Period II . To measure change second phase training , baseline average one two month measure Rest Period I , henceforth call Baseline II . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : To determine one type training superior , compare change score ( i.e. , post-training score minus pre-training score ) type train use standard t-test Mann-Whitney U test , appropriate . Since individual high compare low walk function may respond train differently , divide individual base pretraining walk speed measure 10 MWT ( s ) ( i.e. , &gt; &lt; 0.5 m/s ) . The change score group individual compare type train use standard t-test Mann-Whitney U test , appropriate . To determine time course obtain treatment effect , compare change score first month ( i.e. , outcome measure end 1 mo minus baseline ) versus second month ( outcome measure end 2 mo minus end 1 mo ) training type training , use standard t-test Mann-Whitney U test , appropriate . Retention gain follow 2 month type training . The outcome measure end 2 month rest period compare measure immediately train , individual make improvement great standard error measurement measure , use pair t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test , appropriate .</detailed_description>
