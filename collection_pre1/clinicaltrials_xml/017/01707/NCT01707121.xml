	<brief_summary>Over last decade different life style factor establish risk factor various disease . The obesity pandemic display good example disease great effort undertaken characterize risk factor associate obesity ( 1 ) . Smoking another life style risk factor establish since several decade , primary prevention increasingly successful ( 2 , 3 ) . Cardiovascular epidemiologic research University Gothenburg recognize PA factor importance early thus include PA related question work study large cohort ( 4-6 ) . A 4-level scale introduce late 1960 : Saltin Grimby ( 7 ) use extensively since . With background interest record physical activity one year one month prior certain type elective surgery study relationship PA surgical complication recovery interest . The aim study investigate whether high physical activity prior surgical procedure reduce hospital stay , sick leave complication rate . A secondary aim investigate effect preoperative physical activity rate resumption QoL normal physical function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Physical Activity Outcome Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity ( PA ) focus last two decade life style factor importance . A review summarize nearly 170 study state scientific evidence association lack physical activity cancer convince regard breast colon cancer probable prostate cancer possible lung endometrial cancer ( 8 ) . Regarding postoperative rehabilitation benefit preoperative physical exercise together postoperative early rehabilitation schedule report spinal surgery ( 9 ) . In colorectal surgery benefit enhance recovery program clearly demonstrate ( 10 ) . The impact preoperative prehabilitation evaluate seem beneficial ( 11 , 12 ) , however study use clinically important outcome measure complication postoperative morbidity . The evidence prehabilitation measure reduce postoperative morbidity scarce ( 12 ) . To evaluate recovery surgical procedure broad sense difficult . Several scale try assess recovery ( 13-16 ) . The simple instrument self-reported PA introduce Saltin Grimby show discriminate sedentary active counterpart regard maximum oxygen uptake ( 17 ) validate biological measure ( 18 ) . Indeed , study indicate single self-reported approximation level PA , may predict risk morbidity cardiovascular well total mortality ( 19-21 ) . The self-assessed PA-level concurs well actual physical fitness individual ( 22-24 ) . This also important , since cardiorespiratory fitness may also predict cardiovascular risk mortality ( 25 ) . There also study indicate life-style factor alcohol consumption negative impact outcome surgery well outcome health-care associated infection ( 26 , 27 ) . To screen excessive alcohol consumption Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption ( AUDIT ) test use . Several recent study indicate short survey top three question AUDIT questionnaire ( AUDIT-C ) sufficient provide information alcohol use ( 28 , 29 ) . Smoking also life-style factor affect surgical outcome ( 30 ) . It show increase risk complication study indicate smoke cessation prior surgical procedure reduce risk complication ( 31 ) . Self-reported assessment smoking seem accurate reflect actual nicotine use individual ( 32 ) . Length hospital stay importance patient society . A surgical procedure shorten hospital stay may cost-effective even case high operation room cost ( 33 ) . It also importance consider time work/sick leave ; cost patient society affect cost analysis surgical procedure ( 34 ) . The aim study investigate whether high physical activity prior surgical procedure reduce hospital stay , sick leave complication rate . A secondary aim investigate effect preoperative physical activity rate resumption QoL normal physical function . In order explore importance PA outcome surgical procedure due gallbladder disease , breast cancer colorectal cancer ask patient operate three mentioned condition answer short questionnaire ( Appendix I ) include Saltin Grimby ( 7 ) question study effect level PA immediately surgical operation . The patient ask estimate physical activity four week prior surgical procedure . 1 . Mostly sedentary 2 . Light PA ( garden walk bicycle work ) least two hour week 3 . Moderate PA aerobics , dancing , swimming , play football heavy gardening ) least two hour week 4 . Vigorous PA ( high intensity ) least five hour daily several time week . They also ask report weight , length , smoke habit , alcohol consumption , socioeconomic situation , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidaemia BMI well certain question relation Quality Life postoperative recovery ( Appendix I ) . The question extent validate previous research ( 28 , 29 , 32 , 47 , 48 ) question newly construct . The new question construct expert panel consist colorectal general surgeon , cardiologist specialized nurse . The domain choose related previous research regard recovery ( 42 ) . The questionnaire face-to face validate patient gall bladder surgery plan previous cholecystectomy perform , patient breast cancer prior surgery colorectal cancer patient prior surgery use validation method previously describe prostate cancer ( 48 ) . All patient contact telephone subsequently receive mail questionnaire ( similar pre-operative questionnaire ) ( Appendix II ) regard self-assessed QoL post-operatively postoperative recovery , time relate estimated time recovery follow : - 3 week gallbladder surgery - 3 6 week surgery breast cancer - 3 6 week surgery colorectal cancer</detailed_description>
