	<brief_summary>A combination soft tissue digital nerve defect finger result sensory loss finger pulp . Reconstruction combine injury difficult . When neurocutaneous defect associate wound infection , reconstructive alternative limit . From July 2008 May 2010 , retrospective study conduct 9 consecutive postinfection patient neurocutaneous defect finger follow trauma . The purpose retrospective study report repair complicate infected wound finger use bipedicled nerve flap evaluate efficacy technique .</brief_summary>
