	<brief_summary>1 . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pomalidomide administer CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole compare pomalidomide alone healthy male subject . 2 . To evaluate PK pomalidomide administer CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole plus CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine compare pomalidomide alone healthy male subject . 3 . To assess PK pomalidomide administer CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole compare pomalidomide plus CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole healthy male subject . Part 2 1 ) To evaluate pharmacokinetics pomalidomide administer CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine compare pomalidomide alone healthy male volunteer . Secondary Objectives 1 ) To evaluate safety pomalidomide Part 1 Part 2 administer ketoconazole , fluvoxamine and/or carbamazepine . In addition : To evaluate safety pomalidomide Part 1 Part 2 administer ketoconazole , fluvoxamine and/or carbamazepine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Open-Label Study Evaluate Effect CYP450 P-gp Inhibition Induction Pharmacokinetics Pomalidomide ( CC-4047 ) Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open label non randomize , 2-part study 3 period Part 1 , 2 period Part 2 . Parts 1 2 conduct parallel . The entire study consist screen phase , two dosing part , follow-up telephone call safety . All Periods separate washout period least 3 day ( 5 day ) last pomalidomide dose next drug dose . Safety monitor throughout study . Safety evaluation include adverse event ( AE ) reporting , concomitant medication , PEs , vital sign measurement , 12-lead ECGs , clinical laboratory safety test . Thirty-two healthy ( 16 per Part ) , male adult subject 18 55 year age meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion enrol study . Subjects enrol Part 1 participate Part 2 vice versa . Study treatment ( pomalidomide , ketoconazole , fluvoxamine carbamazepine ) administer meal subject serve standard meal ( ie , breakfast dinner ) approximately 30 minute prior dose . The meal consume within 30 minute serve dose must occur 30 minute ( ±5 minute ) serve meal . Subjects encourage consume whole meal serve prior dose . After dose , food beverage ( except water ) withhold subject least 4 hour post dose ; thereafter , subject serve standard meal snack . For determination plasma concentration pomalidomide , ketoconazole , fluvoxamine carbamazepine ( active metabolite carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide ) dose regimen ( Period ) , serial blood sample collect . A safety follow-up conduct telephone within 4 7 day last dose . In event subject discontinues study prematurely , early termination visit perform within 4 day follow day discontinuation .</detailed_description>
