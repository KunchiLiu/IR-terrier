	<brief_summary>In Afghanistan , study past 15 year show high degree Plasmodium falciparum resistance chloroquine . In 2003 high failure rate chloroquine falciparum malaria lead national malaria treatment programme switch recommend first line drug treatment uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) form Artesunate/Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine ( AS+SP ) . Second line drug treatment oral quinine ( 7 day ) . For operational reason , prior recent study ( manuscript preparation ) molecular data P. falciparum SP resistance marker within border Afghanistan . These study reveal early evidence increase SP resistance ( resistance polymorphism double DHFR &amp; triple DHPS mutation ) . The aim study conduct focus , prospective study Kunar monitoring efficacy AS+SP combination province , along molecular study isolates recruit patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Afghanistan poor country remain largely dependent foreign aid . Life expectancy remain order 60 year , 30 % mortality due communicable disease . Malaria large health burden , antimalarial drug resistance pose considerable threat malaria control . Resistance chloroquine evident Afghanistan late-1990s , failure rate 60 % country whole high 90 % Jalalabad ( Nangarhar province ) . The combination artesunate amodiaquine also prove low efficacy . In 2004 failure rate SP treatment P. falciparum 10-15 % consistent comparable clinical data Afghan refugee reside Pakistan . Given efficacy , Ministry Public Health , consultation WHO international partner , implement AS+SP first-line treatment slide confirm P. falciparum malaria Afghanistan . Quinine ( 7 day po ) second line treatment . CQ+SP recommend treatment patient presumptive diagnosis malaria since 2003 . Both artesunate sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine safe well tolerate drug evidence interaction . Artesunate ( AS ) report associated mild gastrointestinal disturbance , dizziness tinnitus although none association convince . The potentially serious adverse effect report artemisinin class drug clinical trial type I hypersensitivity reaction ( 1:3,000 patient ) . Transient reticulocytopenia , neutropenia , elevate liver enzyme value report none clinically significant . The weight evidence suggest drug significant adverse cardiovascular effect . A variety clinical , neurophysiological , pathologic study human show evidence neurological toxicity . Because drug evaluate extensively early pregnancy human , avoid patient first trim pregnancy uncomplicated malaria information available ( WHO guideline 2006 ) . Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) fix combination long-acting sulfonamide antifolate pyrimethamine . These synergistic sensitive parasite . Minor adverse effect unusual serious sulfonamide toxicity unusual single-dose treatment malaria . The anti-folate property pyrimethamine rarely produce toxicity . The combination AS + SP evaluate extensively adults child uncomplicated malaria sufficiently efficacious area 28-day cure rate sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone exceed 80 % . This ACT currently use part South America , Middle East , South Asia SP susceptibility remain high . Studies conduct 2004-2006 evaluate efficacy artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( AS+SP ) P. falciparum show high efficacy term adequate clinical parasitological response ( Afghanistan National Malaria Strategic Plan ) . The genetic determinant vitro resistance two drug component SP individually show point mutation seven site dihydrofolate reductase gene ( dhfr ) cause resistance pyrimethamine five site dihydropteroate synthase ( dhps ) gene cause resistance sulphadoxine . Different combination mutation within gene confer differ degree insensitivity . Due administrative instability , recently molecular data relate P. falciparum SP resistance marker available within border Afghanistan . However investigator obtain recent ( submit ) data show addition two resistance polymorphism DHFR ( C59R S108N ) well know high frequency region , small number parasite Kunar province three mutation ( A437G , K540E A581G ) DHPS . This study prospective , open label , single arm clinical trial test PCR confirm efficacy tolerability AS+SP treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria Afghanistan . Follow-up 42 day , order sensitively detect recrudescence . Recrudescence distinguish re-infection molecular technique base well characterize microsatellite marker msp1 , msp2 glurp use . Baseline recurrent parasite test DHFR DHPS polymorphism RFLP well sequence indicate . The propose study provide accurate data accurate evidence efficacy current malaria treatment regimen Afghanistan .</detailed_description>
