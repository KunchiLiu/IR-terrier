	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize octreotide LAR ( Long Acting Release ) safely decrease GI bleed patient leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) . Patients undergoing implantation non-pulsatile , continuous-flow LVAD high incidence gastrointestinal bleeding . This significantly associate morbidity threaten patient 's life well ability undergo eventual heart transplantation secondary general health/strength potential development antibody blood product would make future transfusion transplantation difficult . If research find use octreotide LAR decrease incidence gastrointestinal bleeding patient population , revolutionize manner patient manage . The finding reduce GI bleed would allow patient less exposure blood product , reduce hospitalization , ensure subsequent transplant planning delay . This would great benefit patient , would significantly decrease health-care cost preventive measure . The goal project study whether regular administration monthly octreotide LAR safe decrease incidence gastrointestinal bleeding patient undergoing implantation non-pulsatile , continuous flow leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Octreotide Injection Prevent GI Bleeding Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Device ( LVAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary specific aim determine safety octreotide LAR patient LVAD . Patient experience follow assess throughout study ( list obtain up-to-date.com ) Cardiovascular : Sinus bradycardia ( 19 % 25 % ) Hypertension ( ≤13 % ) conduction abnormality ( 9 % 10 % ) Central nervous system : Fatigue ( 1 % 32 % ) headache ( 6 % 30 % ) malaise ( 16 % 20 % ) fever ( 16 % 20 % ) dizziness ( 5 % 20 % ) Pain ( 4 % 15 % ) Dermatologic : Pruritus ( ≤18 % ) Rash ( 15 % ; depot formulation ) alopecia ( ≤13 % ) Endocrine &amp; metabolic : Hyperglycemia ( 2 % 27 % ) Gastrointestinal : Abdominal pain ( 5 % 61 % ) loose stool ( 5 % 61 % ) nausea ( 5 % 61 % ) diarrhea ( 34 % 58 % ) flatulence ( ≤38 % ) cholelithiasis ( 13 % 38 % ; length therapy dependent ) constipation ( 9 % 21 % ) vomiting ( 4 % 21 % ) Hematologic Anemia ( 5-15 % ) Local : Injection site pain ( 2 % 50 % ; dose formulation relate ) Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal : Back pain ( 1 % 27 % ) arthropathy ( 8 % 19 % ) myalgia ( ≤18 % ) Renal Kidney Stones ( 5-15 % ) Respiratory : Upper respiratory infection ( 10 % 23 % ) Miscellaneous : flu symptom ( 1 % 20 % ) Our key secondary outcome focus study drug efficacy . Patient experience follow assess : Need Blood Transfusion Hospital Admission GI Bleed Heart disease lead cause death disability , accord American Heart Association . Current therapy include lifestyle modification , medical management revascularization via Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( CABG ) . However , large portion patient develop cardiomyopathy refractory intervention . They treat chronic inotropes , resynchronization form medical management . Many patient eventually worsen need consideration cardiac transplantation . The Thoratec Heartmate II , primary leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) implant institution , use bridge-to-transplantation . More recently approve destination therapy patient candidate transplantation . Over 6000 device implant worldwide since introduction . We implant 70 VCU Health System McGuire VA Medical Center . The early LVAD device provide physiologic pulsatility , large size require large catheter external venting . The newer continuous flow LVAD device , Heartmate II , offer benefit small easier implant well improve mobility thus quality life . However , benefit come complication increase incidence GI bleeding , think related loss pulsatility nature small device . Approximately 10-30 % patient experience least one episode GI bleed likely multifactorial . It already demonstrate acquire von Willebrand Syndrome ( vWS ) develop due destruction multimeric vWF . Additionally , show patient higher normal percentage gastrointestinal angiodysplasia . Whether preexist develop result de novo angiogenesis gut mucosa unknown . It think loss pulsatility potential hypoxia result secretion angiogenic mediator contribute development angiodysplasia . Current treatment LVAD associate GI bleeding aim identify location bleed treatment blood product transfusion , cryoprecipitate vWS , Desmopressin platelet dysfunction , intervention Interventional Radiology ( IR ) surgery . In addition obvious cost increase morbidity mortality associate therapy , patient receive multiple transfusion develop antibody thus become difficult transplant . Thus vicious cycle develop . We need strive proactive stance patient attack problem source . There considerable amount experience use octreotide idiopathic chronic GI bleeding . This likely due ability decrease splanchnic blood flow potential ability inhibit angiogenesis . Octreotide thoroughly study know safety profile . Off label use octreotide LAR purpose attenuate LVAD associate GI bleed currently practice physician VCU adverse side effect encounter . It time formally study safety efficacy octreotide LAR purpose . We propose open-label safety study 10 subject follow total 24 week . Should safety study favorably complete , multi-center trial randomization octreotide LAR placebo endpoint GI bleed transfusion pursue .</detailed_description>
