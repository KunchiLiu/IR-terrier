	<detailed_description>New approach address intradermal ( ID ) transcutaneous ( TC ) rout immunization develop past year bring novel insight quality efficacy immune response . Indeed , compare muscular tissue widely use vaccination , skin particularly rich antigen present cell . Our recent work show penetration vaccine compound hair follicular duct surround Langerhans cell induce potent cellular immunity contrast intra-muscular immunization . Our result also suggest differential target epidermal Langerhans cell ( TC route ) dermal dendritic cell ( ID route ) could modulate intensity quality immune response vaccine . The aim study evaluate immune response seasonal influenza vaccine administrate byTC ( hair follicular target needle-free method ) , ID ( micro-needle injection ) IM ( conventional intramuscular injection ) rout immunization . Along previous pre-clinical clinical study , hypothesize differential target epidermis dermis antigen-presenting cell differential impact cellular humoral immune response Influenza vaccine . Objectives : We conduct phase I/II clinical trial 60 healthy volunteer compare TC ID rout immunization conventional intramuscular ( IM ) vaccination . The impact rout cellular humoral immune response seasonal influenza vaccine assess baseline , day 21 ( effector phase ) month 5 ( memory phase ) vaccination . Outcomes : Using seasonal Influenza vaccine example conventional vaccine , study evaluate compare efficacy ofTC , ID IMroutes immunization induce cellular response day 21 memory response month 5 phase . The generation maintenance Flu specific neutralize antibody measure Haemagglutination Inhibition microneutralization assays.Moreover , safety tolerance vaccination method evaluate well inflammation innate immune response induce day 1 vaccination . Addressing innovative skin route immunization , study represent essential step move forward development new vaccination strategy . These result important impact amelioration vaccine efficacy less invasive method immunization .</detailed_description>
