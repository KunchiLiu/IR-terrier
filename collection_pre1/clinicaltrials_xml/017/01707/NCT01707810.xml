	<brief_title>Prospective Trial Comparing Conventional Versus Piggyback Method Venous Drainage Transplanted Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-two patient recruit among liver transplant recipient submit surgery Liver Unit Hospital das Clínicas University São Paulo Medical School 8 th October , 1999 30 rd September , 2000 study . The patient assign randomization two group : transplant perform use conventional piggyback method . These patient part large clinical trial pulmonary alteration compare patient operate use conventional method venovenous bypass piggyback method . ( 10 ) Inclusion criterion admit gender , age 18 year old , submit first elective LTx , clinical technical reason justify preferential option conventional piggyback method . For reason , exclude patient submit live donor LTx , IVC routinely preserve familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy , , routine , routinely submit conventional LTx . The randomization process perform team nurse involve intraoperative care patient . This obtain `` coin-tossing '' . In case , randomization pair accord Child-Pugh 's Score , calculate immediately surgery . Stratification perform block randomization subset patient ( score A , B , C ) , block size 2 one-to-one allocation ratio . Thus , first patient Child-Pugh score effectively randomize , second automatically allocate opposite surgical method , complete pair . However , investigator influence second recipient selection due characteristic organ allocation system Brazil , former MELD scale criterion introduce . In time , graft distribution accord four distinct blood group ( A , B , AB , O ) generate great obstacle predict would next patient relate would obtain block 4 size use . Surgeries donor recipient perform small adaptation usual technique order evaluate pressure gradient hepatic vein right atrium two group . In conventional method IVC clamp anhepatic phase venous return maintain portal femoral axillary venovenous bypass centrifugal pump . In case , IVC reconstruction perform end-to-end anastomosis liver . In piggyback method IVC clamp case . Implantation method graft IVC recipient IVC standardize , define responsible surgeon procedure . In two group , patient submit simultaneous arterial portal revascularization , accord routine service . Free hepatic vein pressure ( FHVP ) measure use 8F polyethylene catheter multiperforated distal end , position graft 's right hepatic vein ex situ preparation back table . The proximal end catheter exteriorize infrahepatic portion IVC . In conventional group , exteriorization perform anastomosis suture . In piggyback group , IVC ligate around catheter . Central venous pressure ( CVP ) obtain use Swan-Ganz catheter ( routine procedure ) . Measurement hepatic vein right atrium pressure make , conclude biliary anastomosis . All measurement obtain transducer , determine zero reference level median axillary line . Pressure measurement perform apnea order avoid patient 's respiratory incursion would determine oscillation pressure curve . When oscillation persist spite maneuver , arithmetic mean observe maximum minimum value record . `` hepatic venous block '' consider pressure gradient high 3 mm Hg present . ( 4 ) Serum creatinine ( Cr ) determine preoperatory period ( immediately surgery ) , postoperative day ( PO ) 1 7 14 , 21 28 . Occurrence acute renal failure ( ARF ) define postoperative creatinine peak &gt; = 2.0 . ( 8 ) For case , area curve ( AUC ) Cr vs. time , calculate trapezoidal method ( 11 ) divide postoperative observation time ( 28 day ) , use postoperative overall creatinine parameter . Each group , conventional piggyback , also analyze accord RIFLE classifies ARF three grade increase severity : risk ( class R ) , injury ( class I ) failure ( class F ) - two outcome class - loss end-stage kidney disease . RIFLE classification provide grade base change either Cr urine output baseline condition . The RIFLE criterion important tool help international community compare data ARF validate elsewhere ( 12 , 13 ) , modified 2005 RIFLE-AKIN ( 14 ) . For statistical analysis , study , Class R unify group patient without renal injury ( consider nule alteration ) , patient class I F unify . The outcome class late consequence LTx study present clinical trial . Postoperative massive ascites consider abdominal fluid accumulation volume 500 ml/day 30 day ( 6 ) evaluate body weight , abdominal drain output paracentesis . The patient follow 30 rd June , 2006 , record date death die .</detailed_description>
