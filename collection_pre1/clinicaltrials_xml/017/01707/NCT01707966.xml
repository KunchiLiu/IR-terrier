	<brief_title>Orteronel Maintenance Therapy Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Non-progressive Disease After First-line Docetaxel Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : One six men diagnose cancer prostate lifetime . Accordingly , prostate cancer common cancer amongst men western world . In Switzerland approximately 5'400 men diagnose disease 1'300 die prostate cancer every year . Prostate cancer represent 30 % cancer diagnose men . Despite early detection new treatment life time risk die prostate cancer remain stable 3 % since 1980 . Metastatic prostate cancer hormone-sensitive therefore androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) treatment choice . Yet , virtually patient metastatic prostate cancer progress androgen deprivation therapy ( call castration-resistant prostate cancer : CRPC ) . Further hormonal manipulation often administer ( e.g . maximal androgen blockade addition non-steroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide ) , however intervention modest impact . Metastatic CRPC ( mCRPC ) progress despite therapy nowadays treat docetaxel-based chemotherapy . In phase III trial , treatment mCRPC patient docetaxel combination low dose prednisone result significant survival advantage comparison previous standard care mitoxantrone plus prednisone . Moreover docetaxel treatment improve response rate , progression free survival symptom control . The current standard care patient disease stabilization first line chemotherapy docetaxel wait-and-watch strategy , patient regularly examine hospital every 3-4 week . A second line chemotherapy patient mCRPC standardize recently . However , two trial present 2010 change landscape : novel taxane cabazitaxel test phase III trial mitoxantrone second line chemotherapy patient progress docetaxel . There significant improvement overall survival , progression free survival response rate . Most included patient experience disease progression within three month docetaxel first line treatment . Cabazitaxel associate increased toxicity include 5 % toxic death . Another randomized phase III trial use abiraterone patient progression docetaxel show significant improvement overall survival pain palliation . Abiraterone belong group agent effectively inhibit androgen synthesis via blockade key enzyme cytochrome P-450c17 ( CYP17 ) . The new drug orteronel ( TAK-700 ) belong group active substance abiraterone . Orteronel currently subject large international Phase III study patient metastatic carcinoma prostate progression disease follow docetaxel . Initial result show orteronel effectively inhibit testosterone synthesis , contrast abiraterone , few side effect . Rational : CYP17 inhibitor active well tolerated agent treatment patient castration-resistant prostate cancer . However , despite activity patient become resistant new form antihormonal treatment hence develop progression median approximately 6 month . In case , option limit outline . In reported post-docetaxel trial large phase III trial , patient start CYP17 inhibitor treatment time disease progression . Trials examine advanced malignant disease lung cancer show initiate effective treatment earlier disease course end first-line chemotherapy ( call switch maintenance therapy ) beneficial term progression free survival ( PFS ) also overall survival ( OS ) . This may also hold true early administration antihormonal agent patient mCRPC . Therefore , aim trial test hypothesis start orteronel disease stabilization docetaxel prolongs event-free survival ( EFS ) , consequently maintain good quality life ( QL ) eventually also improve OS .</detailed_description>
