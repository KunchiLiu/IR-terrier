	<brief_summary>The aim study measure radiation exposure coronary angiography ( CA ) trans-radial approach ( TRA ) , specifically compare access via leave versus right radial artery patient suggest clinical predictor TRA failure/difficult . These predictor include age &gt; 70 , female gender , height &lt; 64 inch , history hypertension.The study also aim determine difficulty encounter left right radial access specific patient population . A secondary aim compare result enrol patient registry patient femoral access obtain . Currently 1 million percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) perform United States annually . There grow trend perform procedure utilize TRA due recent data demonstrate decreased bleed access-site complication compare femoral approach . However , TRA approach also know associate great radiation exposure compare femoral approach . Furthermore , TRA catheterization may difficult certain population anatomic consideration . Though traditionally complete via canalization right radial artery ( RRA ) due feasibility room setup , leave radial artery ( LRA ) access may superior due short distance need reach ascend aorta bypass tortuosity right subclavian artery . Given benefit TRA , important determine leave versus right radial artery access affect parameter radiation exposure addition procedural difficulty . This study prospective , randomized study patient suggest predictor TRA failure/difficulty refer coronary angiography . Patients refer coronary angiography use trans-radial approach randomly assign obtain arterial access via right leave radial artery . A registry patient refer coronary angiography use trans-femoral approach compile . The primary outcome measure radiation exposure measure dose area product output coronary angiography system . Secondary measure include total fluoroscopy time , total dose radiation , number catheter use , incidence subclavian tortuosity . In addition , procedural complication success rate also evaluate .</brief_summary>
