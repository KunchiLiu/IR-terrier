	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicentre , observational study aim test pre-operative platelet function take anti-platelet medication . The investigator use simple bedside blood test call Thromboelastography ( TEG ) Platelet Mapping Assay ( PMA ) . The investigator follow patient throughout hospital stay major cardiac complication ( MACE ) surgery ( peri-operative ) . The investigator hope determine association well platelets inhibit drug surgery MACE perioperative period , 30 day , one year follow-up . Also , response various people anti-platelet medication chance get major adverse cardiac outcome determine genetic makeup . The investigator try determine certain gene associate high cardiac risk . Hypothesis : In patient percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) undergo non-cardiac surgery ( NCS ) major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) associate inadequate platelet inhibition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data analysis : The participant ' demographic , preoperative characteristic postoperative information summarize use descriptive statistic : express mean ( standard deviation ) median ( minimum , maximum , interquartile range ) continuous variable number ( percent ) categorical variable . We initially use restricted cubic spline plot evaluate nature association platelet inhibition ( continuous variable ) risk MACE ( logit transformation ) . Based upon result , determine percent inhibition treat continuous variable , whether categorize along specific cut-offs . We also compare result receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis . Once determined appropriate approach describe percent platelet inhibition , univariate analysis perform chi-square Fishers ' exact test categorical data , t-test Mann-Whitney U test continuous data . A p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Random effect multivariable logistic regression use assess adjust association platelet inhibition MACE perioperative period.46 This regression model employ random intercept center , minimize bias due confound center.47 Regression model construct selectively include potentially confound perioperative variable associate high risk MACE ( identify literature clinical experience ) .7-12 In addition platelet inhibition ( preoperative value change ) , four covariates include model : type stent ; time PCI NCS ; mono- , dual ( aspirin aspirin clopidogrel ) therapy day surgery ; urgent surgery . Since recommended range platelet inhibition ( 20-50 % ) never validate perioperative period describe continuous variable ( 0-100 % ) . Primary analysis per protocol secondary analysis include patient incomplete data i.e . discharge early refuse one TEG sample . Sample Size : The sample size estimation base comparison platelet inhibition ( measure continuous variable ) individual suffer MACE . We assume difference MACE non-MACE group regard platelet inhibition would correspond medium Cohen 's effect size ( 0.5 SD ; i.e . difference mean equal 0.5 pooled standard deviation ) . Based assumption medium effect size difference , expect 20 % rate MACE , 2-sided alpha 0.05 , 90 % power , 10 % dropout rate , would need 189 patient total . In addition , since plan statistical model involve logistic regression total five covariates ( platelet inhibition value ; stent type ; emergency surgery ; time PCI NCS ; mono- , dual therapy PCI [ aspirin vs. aspirin clopidogrel medication ] ) sample size estimate would still approximately 8 event per include covariate regression model . To minimize bias regression model , estimate recommend minimum number outcome per covariate 5-10 .</detailed_description>
