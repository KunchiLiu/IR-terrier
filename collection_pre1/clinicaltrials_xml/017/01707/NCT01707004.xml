	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well decitabine total-body irradiation follow donor bone marrow transplant cyclophosphamide work treat patient relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia . Giving decitabine total-body irradiation donor bone marrow transplant help stop growth cancer cell . It may also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Sometimes transplanted cell donor make immune response body 's normal cell . Giving decitabine total-body irradiation transplant together high-dose cyclophosphamide , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil transplant may stop happening .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Total-Body Irradiation Followed By Donor Bone Marrow Transplant Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival 100 day transplantation follow decitabine bone marrow transplant use donor least partially-matched myeloablative preparative regimen post-transplantation cyclophosphamide graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Patients enrol study also follow follow endpoint : neutrophil platelet recovery , graft failure , acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , chronic GVHD , incidence infection , treatment-related mortality , time relapse/progression , overall survival , progression-free survival . OUTLINE : Beginning day -29 -22 , patient receive decitabine intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour daily 10 day , fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day -5 -2 , busulfan IV 3 hour day -5 -2 . PREPARATIVE REGIMEN : Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily ( BID ) day -1 . TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant day 0 . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour day 3 4 , tacrolimus orally ( PO ) BID IV continuously day 5-180 , mycophenolate mofetil PO three time daily ( TID ) day 5-35 filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day 5 absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1,000/mm^3 3 consecutive day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
