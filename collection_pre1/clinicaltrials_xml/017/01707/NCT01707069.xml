	<brief_summary>This research study vaccine allergy Japanese Red Cedar . The vaccine call CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine . This research study determine vaccine tolerate research participant respond vaccine various dos . CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine investigational , mean approve use United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) available research study like one . This first time CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine give human . The purpose study evaluate safety investigational vaccine intend treat allergy Japanese red cedar . The vaccine compose DNA , material cell use provide instruction make protein . The DNA carry information necessary make special protein combination protein find cell , LAMP ( lysosomal associate membrane protein ) , protein Japanese red cedar cause allergy know Cry J2 . This vaccine intend help re-educate immune system respect respond naturally occur red cedar allergen eliminate allergic symptom . Another purpose study document immune response vaccine Subjects eligible participate study assign whether sensitive non sensitive CryJ2 Mountain Cedar chance ( like flip coin ) one 3 study vaccine group : Group 1 : receive four ( 4 ) 4-milligram dos study vaccine . Group 2 : receive four ( 4 ) 2-milligram dos study vaccine . Group 3 : receive four ( 4 ) 4-milligram dos study vaccine . The study vaccine administer intramuscular injection . Enrolled subject receive study vaccine every 14 day ( day 0 , 14 , 28 42 ) . Subjects know study vaccine assignment . Participants allergic Japanese red cedar assign Group 1 . Participants allergy Japanese red cedar Mountain Cedar equal chance assign Group 2 3 . There 18 30 men woman participate study one location . Your participation study last approximately 72 day .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient age 18 63 year , either : 1 . Japanese Red Cedar pollen Mountain Cedar negative skin test lack presence antiCry j 2 antibody ( To assign Group 1 ) 2 . Japanese Red Cedar pollen Mountain Cedar positive skin test and/or presence antiCryJ2 antibody ( assign Group 2 3 ) . For purpose study , retrospective skin test data ( long perform within 60 day screen ) accept , use positive inclusion criterion 2 . Execute write informed consent ( English appropriate Japanese ) participate study . 3 . A minimum 1year history seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis ( Nasal symptom : sneezing , itching , rhinorrhea , congestion ; Ocular symptom : itching , redness , watering ; Other : itching ears/throat ) exposure Japanese Red Cedar pollen and/or Mountain Cedar pollen . Subjects clinical history include symptom allergic rhinitis Japanese Red Cedar Mountain Cedar season expose Japanese Red Cedar and/or Mountain Cedar pollen . 4 . Documented allergy Japanese Red Cedar pollen demonstrate positive epicutaneous skin test Japanese Red Cedar pollen Mountain Cedar antigen ( wheal &gt; 3mm great negative control ) . Although , subject may positive skin test allergen , use qualify participate study . 5 . Female subject childbearing potential , define surgically sterile least 2 year postmenopausal , must agree use one follow form contraception duration study : hormonal ( oral , implant , injection ) begin &gt; 30 day prior screen , barrier ( condom , diaphragm spermicide ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , vasectomized partner ( 6 month minimum ) . 6 . No clinically significant abnormal finding physical examination , exception HEENT finding consistent allergic rhinitis , medical history , clinical laboratory result screen , opinion Investigator , would jeopardize safety subject impact validity study result . 7 . Subject must willing able comply study requirement . 1 . Previous Japanese red cedar allergen immunotherapy ( SCIT , oral immunotherapy , SLIT , recombinant peptide ) 2 . History anaphylaxis require medical intervention . 3 . Intolerance severe allergic reaction previous immunotherapy ( SCIT , oral immunotherapy , SLIT , recombinant peptide 4 . History asthma require daily medication exception exercise induce asthma . ( history intermittent and/or mild asthma permit ) 5 . Subjects receive antiIgE monoclonal antibody . 6 . Congenital immune deficiency acquire immune suppression . Causes acquire immune suppression may include , limited , systemic illness malignancy infection , use medication corticosteroid chemotherapeutic agent , radiation therapy . 7 . History organ transplant , hematologic malignancy , autoimmune disease , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure . 8 . History clinically significant gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , neurologic , hematologic disease , opinion Principal Investigator , would jeopardize safety subject impact validity study result . 9 . Inability unwillingness stop use drug may inhibit ability treat severe allergic adverse event . This include , limit ; beta blocker atenolol ( Tenormin ) , metoprolol ( Lopressor , ToprolXL ) propranolol ( Inderal , Inderal LA ) 48 hour prior Visit 1 duration study . All subject must antihistamine therapy 7 day skin test . 10 . Female subject try conceive , pregnant , lactate . 11 . Positive serum pregnancy test screen positive human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) urine test Visit 1 woman childbearing potential . 12 . Positive blood screen human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbSAg ) , Hepatitis C. 13 . FEV1 &lt; 70 % measure spirometry . 14 . Chronic history recurrent sinusitis , urticaria angioedema within last 12 month . 15 . History alcohol drug abuse within year prior Screening Visit 1 , current evidence substance dependence abuse . 16 . Laboratory Values ( hematology , biochemistry , urine test , PFT ) outside normal range , unless abnormality consider clinically significant investigator . 17 . Participation clinical trial receipt nonFDA approve therapy within 30 day prior Screening Visit . 18 . Subjects antiLAMP antibody Cutpoint Assay baseline exclude .</criteria>
