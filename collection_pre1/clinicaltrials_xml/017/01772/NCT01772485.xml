	<brief_title>Online Neuroplasticity Training Remediation ADHD Adolescent Children ( ONTRAC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children diagnose ADHD , comprise nearly 9 % American child similar proportion Indian child , risk failure drop school , prone develop addiction , drive accident , commit felony later life suffer overall poor quality life . Rescuing cognitive faculty child thus immediate importance , perspective individual , also urgency pose large socio-economic health-care burden associate disorder . The investigator recently develop efficient , state-of-the-art , web-based , cost-effective highly scalable cognitive training program ADHD ( 'Rewired ' ) translate real-life functional gain affect child . The novel program target fundamental neurobehavioral/ cognitive deficit identify disorder . These include deficit general alertness , selective attention work memory goal-relevant information , control impulsive action suppression distract information - panoply problem comprehensively address intervention population to-date . Recent advance neuroscientific research provide key insight application brain-based method behavioral train drive substantial functional gain . This research form mechanistic basis development approach . Moreover , principal exercise form train program independently demonstrate significant benefit attentionally-impaired population towards remediation core cognitive deficit intersect deficient domain ADHD . Here , core exercise form tailor elaborated comprehensive program suite 26 engaging , performance-adaptive , reward training module provide 30 hour rigorous neuroplasticity-based cognitive training child ADHD . The investigator propose validate usability feasibility novel training program randomize control trial ( RCT ) setting . It hypothesize improvement specific core cognitive domain deficient ADHD , shall translate good overall cognitive function daily life well significant reduction ADHD symptom severity . The current intervention ultimately project well life quality child ADHD , potential substantially reduce large personal , familial , societal economic burden associate disorder worldwide .</detailed_description>
