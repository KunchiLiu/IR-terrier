	<brief_summary>This study evaluate type Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) sequence call arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) . The investigator hope ASL good localize area brain ( lesion ) cause epilepsy . This type MRI require contrast , use radiation , add 4 minute routine MRI do patient epilepsy . The study hypothesis patient refractory epilepsy , Arterial Spin Labeling ( ASL ) MRI show area abnormality brain degree single-photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently , presurgical evaluation epilepsy patient , PET SPECT study utilized evaluate metabolic perfusion abnormality respectively localize seizure onset . This especially true `` MRI negative '' patient , whose lesion visible standard MRI technique . PET SPECT study numerous disadvantage , include radiation exposure , injection contrast isotope , cost , often difficult access many patient . Arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) MRI sequence show perfusion relate abnormality without use contrast , relatively short amount time , do normal MRI evaluation epilepsy . This interest good correlation , ASL MRI sequence could use addition , place , study require injection isotope radiation CT scan . ASL sequence show localize certain epileptogenic abnormality tuber tuberous sclerosis . A previous study demonstrate ASL change inter- post-ictally one patient without MRI change . This promising technique fully evaluate yet . Of note , study do area regard epilepsy retrospective , small study . The investigator plan perform study prospective , comparatively large sample patient . Study Design : Consultants epilepsy clinic identify potential subject patient ' initial evaluation . Just consultation finish , epilepsy clinic , study describe patient along risk benefit , inform consent obtain one researcher research personnel clinic . If patient agrees study , MRI department notify patient 's participation . At time , patient 's already schedule MRI addition ASL sequence . This add approximately 4 minute MRI . The patient image investigation deem necessary treating consultant . This may include PET SPECT . If patient admit EMU , ictal interictal SPECT likely do . After patient full evaluation , compare ASL MRI sequence basic MRI , PET SPECT perform . We also use software already develop determine quantitative blood flow abnormality find ASL sequence .</detailed_description>
