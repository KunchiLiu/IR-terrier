	<brief_summary>Background purpose : Freezing gait ( FOG ) one disable motor symptom people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , closely associate postural instability fall . Previous study show somatosensory stimulation could induce weight shift , probably helpful gait reinitiation . Therefore , investogators propose two-year project develop wearable device , somatosensory stimulation system ( SSS ) , monitor gait real-time provide somatosensory stimulation FOG episodes detect . And investigator test effect SSS device FOG , fall , walk function . Methods : The first-year study build validate wearable SSS device . The customized device sensor part stimulator part ; former inertial sensor module detect FOG episode , latter microvibrator-embedded insole facilitate weight shift gait reinitiation . To validate device , patient FOG recruit conduct FOG-provoking task medication `` OFF '' `` late On '' state laboratory setting . The investigator test SSS device could facilitate lateral weight shift help gait reinitiation , well reliability . The second-year study test SSS device stand long-term , daily wear basis , evaluate effect FOG , fall , walk function . The investigator recruit PD patient FOG , randomly assign experimental control group . Both group wear SSS device daytime ten week , stimulator part turn first six week ( intervention phase ) experimental group . The stimulator part keep last four week ( follow-up phase ) group . The effect SSS device evaluate outcome include FOG severity , fall walking function , measure prior/after intervention phase follow-up phase . Clinical relevance : This project tempt combine real-time gait analysis somatosensory-induced postural readjustment , use novel approach improve FOG fall people PD . The result project might also provide objective , long-term assessment tool measure FOG phenomenon clinical research field .</brief_summary>
