	<brief_title>Effects Air Purifying Device ( PureNight ) Sleep Quality Obstructive Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective There many detrimental effect obstructive airway disease . One hallmark effect poor sleep quality . Due association air pollutant worsen respiratory symptom , logical intervention improve sleep quality may air filtration . A novel air filtration system , PureNight SystemTM , deliver pre-filtered air around head sleep person , may offer solution decrease exposure noxious trigger time spend sleep improve sleep quality . One method measure sleep quality use 24-hour actigraphy . The actigraph small , wrist-worn device contain pizo-electric bender element , accelerometer , measure wrist movement . Algorithms interpret movement epoch-by-epoch basis identify sleep/wake state circadian rhythm activity count . Study Design We propose study effect Pure Night TM air filtration system cohort patient chronic obstructive airway disease self-reported poor sleep quality due nocturnal respiratory symptom . We hypothesize patient use Pure Night TM system would fewer nocturnal awakening consolidation sleep time measure actigraphy well sleep quality measure quality sleep questionnaire use device . In cross-over randomized clinical trial , baseline measurement compare treatment PureNight TM device `` sham '' filtration . Sleep variable include data circadian rhythm compare use within-subject design test condition . Methodology Each subject underwent baseline actigraphy 7 day follow two seven day treatment arm 7-day wash-out period treatment arm . Subject slept PureNight arm study . The system use arm study identical except one arm sham filter replace HEPA filter PureNight TM system random order . Participants complete Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index start study end treatment phase . Objective estimate sleep calculate actigraphy recording use device 's proprietary software .</detailed_description>
