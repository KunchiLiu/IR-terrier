	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) image quality follow peripheral venous high pressure injection iodinate intravenous contrast medium 20 gauge ( GA ) fenestrated , intravenous catheter ( BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ ) 18 GA non-fenestrated , intravenous catheter . In contrast enhance CT procedure ( CECT ) , machine ( power injector ) use rapidly deliver contrast agent individual 's circulatory system . The contrast allow great differentiation tissue image area interest , afford good opportunity visually assess area hence make accurate diagnosis . CECT often require high rate contrast flow ( ≥ 5 mL/sec ) IV catheter provide sufficient contrast acceptable image . Typically 18 GA IV catheter require achieve high flow rate ; however , often patient vein accommodate large size catheter . The BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter design deliver high flow rate conventional catheter gauge incorporate fenestration ( small opening ) near tip catheter allow fluid exit catheter addition normally exit main open tip catheter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective study perform adult human subject refer CECT . The study occur single visit . Once consent enrol , subject whose antecubital vein accommodate 18 GA IV catheter ( assessed Inserter designee PI ) , randomize receive either conventional 18 GA IV catheter ( reference , control ) 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter ( test ) . Subjects whose vein consider suitable 18 GA IV catheter place non-randomized cohort placement 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter . Subjects receive one ( 1 ) catheter study . The primary objective study compare multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) image quality follow peripheral venous high pressure injection iodinate intravenous contrast medium 20 GA fenestrated , intravenous catheter ( BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ ) 18 GA non-fenestrated , intravenous catheter . The 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter consider non-inferior conventional 18 GA IV catheter 95 % upper bound difference percentage image acceptable quality image acquire use 18 GA IV catheter 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter less 15 % . Study catheter insert appropriately license healthcare professional ( Inserters ) . Prior enrollment , potential Inserters train qualified Sponsor proper use BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter artificial hand model human patient . Inserters expect use test product period two ( 2 ) week , order gain familiarity product . Because BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter currently use Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center , Sponsor provide BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter use train familiarization period .</detailed_description>
