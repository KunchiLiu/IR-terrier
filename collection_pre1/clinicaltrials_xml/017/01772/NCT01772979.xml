	<detailed_description>The main contribution hereditary ovarian cancer come breast cancer ( BRCA ) gene mutation , responsible 90 % hereditary ovarian cancer . The two susceptibility gene associate epithelial-type OC BRCA1 BRCA2 . The BRCA proteins play important role DNA repair mechanism also involve control cell cycle checkpoint , protein ubiquitinization chromatin remodelling . Mutations BRCA gene extensively described family affect breast and/or OC ; mutate BRCA1 find 75 % family hereditary OC - Recent data suggest dysfunction BRCA1andBRCA2 , so-called BRCAness , maybe prevalent originally assume . Both genetic epigenetic mechanism create BRCAness phenotype least third epithelial ovarian cancer . The definition BRCAness ovarian cancer : high-grade serous cancer , high initial sensitivity platinum drug retention platinum-sensitivity multiple relapse , long history disease , long survival , long TFIs relapse . Yondelis® ( trabectedin ) propose block transcriptional activation subset inducible gene without affect constitutive expression . Trabectedin bind minor groove DNA , bend helix major groove . This bind DNA trigger cascade event affect several transcription factor , DNA bind protein , DNA repair pathway , result perturbation cell cycle . Cell cycle study action trabectedin tumor cell vitro reveal decrease rate progression cell S phase towards G2 cause prolonged blockade G2/M biologically relevant concentration ( 20-80 nM ) . These cell cycle block p53-independent lead strong apoptopic response . Cells G1 sensitive cytotoxic effect trabectedin . These effect appear relate unique 3-subunit structure , two subunit ring involve bind minor groove DNA guanine-cytosine rich sequence alkylation N2 guanine form adduct distort DNA helix structure recognize TC-NER mechanism . DNA repair proficiency major determinant cytotoxicity trabectedin : human cell line deficient gene essential TC-NER activity XPA , XPB , XPD , XPF , XPG , ERCC1 , CSA CSB resistant trabectedin , resistance revert complementation cell correspond gene . Trabectedin induce double strand break BRCA1-/- human cell line HCC1937 BRCA2Δ22/Δ22 mouse cell sensitive trabectedin hypersensitivity revert complementation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene . Based observation hypothesize NER machinery trap DNA lesion induce trabectedin resolve cell produce double strand break repair HRR machinery , synergistic action TC-NER HRR machinery would necessary maximal trabectedin cytotoxicity .</detailed_description>
