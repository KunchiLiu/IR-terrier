Oxidative stress observe patient CF exercise intolerance show predict mortality patient CF , regardless healthy lung . A critical barrier improve quality life longevity patient CF lack knowledge regard different reason patient CF exercise level peer . We collect preliminary data support central hypothesis oxidative stress contributes impairment blood vessel function rest exercise ultimately oxygen transport delivery result exercise intolerance .

	<brief_title>Cystic Fibrosis Endothelial Function : At Rest During Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There major advance research medical therapy target improvement lung function ; however , non-pulmonary factor neglect . Based recent discovery patient CF systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction , reasonable suspect involvement blood vessel pathophysiology exercise intolerance CF - concept yet examine . Thus overall goal proposal provide mechanistic evidence oxidative stress contribute 1 ) endothelial dysfunction 2 ) exercise intolerance patient CF . Our central hypothesis cystic fibrosis facilitates whole body oxidative stress contributes independently endothelial dysfunction exercise intolerance . In support central hypothesis , generate compelling preliminary data demonstrate efficacy antioxidant improve endothelial function exercise capacity patient CF . In addition , identify robust inverse relationship oxidative stress exercise intolerance patient CF , patient high basal level oxidative stress low exercise capacity . Further , identify patient CF exaggerate oxidative stress response sub-maximal exercise compare healthy control . Specific Aim 1 : To test hypothesis oxidative stress contribute endothelial dysfunction patient cystic fibrosis Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) , microvascular function , marker oxidant status ( alkoxyl ascorbyl free radical , 8-isoprostane , lipid hydroperoxide , total antioxidant capacity , lipid soluble antioxidant ) measure baseline 2 hour follow ingestion oral anti-oxidant cocktail ( vitamin C , E , alpha-lipoic acid ) placebo cocktail ( double blind , randomize , cross-over design ) patient CF . Based preliminary data , predict antioxidant cocktail restore endothelial function oxidant status control value , whereas change observe follow placebo . Specific Aim 2 : To test hypothesis oxidative stress contributes exercise intolerance patient cystic fibrosis Exercise capacity ( VO2 peak ) indices gas exchange ( O2 uptake kinetics , expire CO2 , VE/VO2 , VE/VCO2 ) determine use Godfrey grade maximal exercise test cycle ergometer 2 hour follow ingestion either antioxidant cocktail placebo cocktail ( double blind , randomize , cross-over design ) patient CF . Based preliminary data , predict patient CF exhibit improvement exercise capacity follow antioxidant cocktail , whereas change observe follow placebo cocktail . Specific Aim 3 : Test hypothesis chronic dose anti-oxidant cocktail improve endothelial function contribute improvement exercise capacity patient cystic fibrosis Following completion Aims 1 2 , endothelial function , exercise capacity ( VO2 peak ) , indices gas exchange ( indicate ) , perform , patient CF , baseline , 4 week , 8 week , 12 week follow anti-oxidant cocktail take day . Secondary outcome include measurement arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity ) , Physioflow Enduro , biomarkers nitric oxide bioavailability . This chronic experiment test mechanism increase endothelial function improve exercise capacity CF .</detailed_description>
