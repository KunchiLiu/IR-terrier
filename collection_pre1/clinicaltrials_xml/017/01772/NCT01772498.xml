	<brief_summary>This study design take first step toward test efficacy acceptability heart rate variability biofeedback ( HRVB ) mean ameliorate psychological distress survivor Primary Brain Tumour ( PBT ) . HRVB biofeedback approach provide client real time feedback heart rate variability ( HRV ) mean teach breathe specific , therapeutic manner . More specifically , study design test several hypothesis . Each hypothesis base prediction , sample psychologically distress PBT survivor , course 8 HRVB session demonstrate : - statistically significant reduction level depression - statistically significant reduction level anxiety - statistically significant increase rest HRV - reduction anxiety depression significantly , negatively correlate increase rest HRV - HRVB view acceptable intervention participant In addition hypothesis state , study also investigate discovery orient manner HRVB intervention positive impact participant : - level sleep impairment - level pain</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose This study test efficacy acceptability heart rate variability biofeedback ( HRVB ) mean ameliorate psychological distress survivor Primary Brain Tumour ( PBT ) . HRVB biofeedback approach provide client real time feedback heart rate variability ( HRV ) mean teach breathe specific , therapeutic manner . HRVB show increase autonomic nervous system efficiency also decrease anxiety depression . Background Rationale Anxiety depression two strong driver overall quality life ( Q L ) survivor primary , malignant brain tumour ( PMBT ) . In cohort 73 PMBT survivor , `` depression score alone account half variance Q L score '' ( Pelletier et al , 2003 , p. 47 ) . Anxiety symptom similarly negatively correlate over-all Q L ( r = -..72 ) brain tumour survivor ( Janda et al. , 2007 ) . Evidence also suggest , relative general population , brain tumour survivor exhibit much high rate depression ( Wellisch et al. , 2002 ) anxiety ( Arnold et al. , 2007 ) . Despite striking finding around prevalence importance anxiety depression brain tumour population , single identify study use purely psychological intervention ameliorate symptom depression and/or anxiety unique , understandably distressed population . Therefore , research kind urgently need . Heart Rate variability Biofeedback A course HRVB , close variant , show statistically significant effect depression and/or anxiety numerous study . HRVB also recently find associated improvement pain insomnia , two common barrier quality life PMBT survivor . Design Overview As early stage study , one group , open label design adopt . Recruitment Process Participants recruit send letter potential participant identify BC Cancer Agency registry encourage referral local oncologist . Measures The primary outcome measure rest HRV , Beck Depression Inventory II , Trait Anxiety Inventory . Secondary outcome include Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index . Likert scale questionnaire also use intervention ass acceptability intervention . HRVB Protocol The protocol involve 8 weekly session 60 minute , follow general approach describe Lehrer , Vaschillo , &amp; Vaschillo ( 2000 ) . Participants also practice breathe resonant frequency 20 minute day home . Analysis Three form analysis conduct . First , pair t-tests residualized change score effect size ( Cohen 's ) use analyze pre-post change psychometric measure HRV data . Second , correlational analysis also use see expected association pre-post change emotion , pain sleep measure relative pre-post change rest HRV index . Finally , mean standard deviation use assess participant ' likert rating acceptability intervention . Plans Current Findings Results develop publication relevant , peer review scientific journal . Results also use develop future research line , include study effciacy HRVB psychologically distress caregiver PMBT survivor .</detailed_description>
