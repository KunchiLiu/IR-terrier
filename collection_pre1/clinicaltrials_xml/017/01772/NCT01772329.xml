	<brief_summary>The investigator propose randomize controlled trial evaluate effect treatment intend reduce pain catastrophizing among patient report high pain catastrophizing prior total knee replacement ( TKR ) , total hip replacement ( THR ) , shoulder surgery effort thereby reduce incidence persistent post-surgical pain ( PPP ) enhance physical function 3-months post-surgery . Preemptive treatment aim know predictor PPP follow total knee replacement highly innovative potentially high impact public health . Cognitive therapy well-tolerated modality among chronic pain patient side effect . Cognitive therapy ( CT ) represent inexpensive method could greatly reduce suffer costly post-surgical pain management high risk TKR patient .</brief_summary>
