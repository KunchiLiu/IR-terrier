	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria dose escalation expansion phase : Signed write informed consent Male female subject age great equal 18 year Subjects must histologically cytologically proven metastatic locally advanced solid tumor , standard therapy exist standard therapy fail . Availability tumor archival material fresh biopsy optional subject dose escalation Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 trial entry estimate life expectancy least 3 month Disease must measurable least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion RECIST 1.1 , except subject metastatic castrateresistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) may enrol objective evidence disease without measureable lesion Adequate hematological , hepatic renal function define protocol Effective contraception male female subject risk conception exist Other protocol define inclusion criterion could apply Inclusion Criteria expansion phase : Subjects must relapse , refractory , progressive disease follow last line treatment ( exception gastric gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) cancer cohort , require progression ) . Availability tumor archival material fresh biopsy ( exclude bone biopsy ) mandatory eligibility expansion cohort . For subject MBC cohort , biopsy surgical specimen must collect within 90 day prior first investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) administration . Specifically , follow require : NSCLC post platinum doublet : Histologically cytologically confirm stage IIIB stage IV NSCLC progress 1 line platinumcontaining doublet chemotherapy . Subjects receive 1 line platinumcontaining treatment metastatic disease ( i.e. , adjuvant treatment platinumcontaining regimen sufficient eligibility receive context metastatic disease ) . Subjects NSCLC cohort enrol USA NSCLC first line : Stage IV ( per 7th International Association Study Lung Cancer [ IASLC ] classification ) recurrent NSCLC histologically proven . Subjects must receive treatment metastatic recurrent disease . No activate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation ALK translocation/rearrangement Gastric GEJ cancer : Histologically confirm , unresectable locally advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma gastric gastroesophageal junction , treat firstline chemotherapy combination without disease progression . Subjects receive 1 line treatment metastatic disease . Subjects treat trastuzumab ( Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 [ HER2 ] positive ) . Subjects receive platinum contain doublet triplet neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy , ultimately candidate surgery also eligible , long progressive disease completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . In addition , subject gastric cancer enter study white blood cell ( WBC ) lymphocyte count define protocol MBC : Subjects must histologically confirm locally advanced MBC tumor refractory progressive standard care therapy . Subjects must receive 3 prior line cytotoxic therapy metastatic disease . Subjects must receive taxane anthracycline , unless contraindicate Secondary expansion cohort : Metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) , Metastatic castrateresistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , melanoma , ovarian cancer , ACC , mesothelioma , urothelial carcinoma renal cell carcinoma define protocol Efficacy expansion cohort : Gastric GEJ cancer ( third line ) , ovarian cancer ( platinum Refractory + liposomal doxorubicin ) , urothelial carcinoma , HNSCC define protocol Other protocol define inclusion criterion expansion phase could apply Exclusion Criteria dose escalation expansion phase : Concurrent treatment nonpermitted drug Prior therapy specific antibody/drug target T cell coregulatory protein ( immune checkpoint ) Concurrent anticancer treatment , major surgery , use investigational drug within 28 day start trial treatment ; concurrent systemic therapy immunosuppressive agent , use hormonal agent within 7 day start trial treatment define protocol . Note : Subjects receive bisphosphonate denosumab eligible provide treatment initiate least 14 day first dose avelumab . Previous malignant disease target malignancy investigate trial within last 5 year exception basal squamous cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ Rapidly progressive disease ( example , tumor lysis syndrome ) Active history central nervous system metastases Receipt organ transplantation include allogeneic stemcell transplantation Significant acute chronic infection define protocol Active history autoimmune disease ( subject diabetes Type 1 , vitiligo , psoriasis , hypo hyperthyroid disease require immunosuppressive treatment eligible ) immunodeficiency Known severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody , history anaphylaxis , uncontrolled asthma Persisting toxicity relate prior therapy great Grade 1 NCICTCAE v4.0 , however sensory neuropathy less equal Grade 2 acceptable Pregnancy lactation period Known alcohol drug abuse Clinically significant ( , active ) cardiovascular disease All significant disease ( example , inflammatory bowel disease ) , , opinion investigator , might impair subject 's tolerance trial treatment Any psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent Legal incapacity limit legal capacity Nononcology vaccine therapy prevention infection disease ( example , seasonal flu vaccine , human papilloma virus vaccine ) within 4 week study drug administration . Vaccination study also prohibit except administration inactivate influenza vaccine</criteria>
