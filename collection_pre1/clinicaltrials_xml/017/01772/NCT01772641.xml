	<brief_summary>This study three main aim . Aim 1 : To provide initial data efficacy combine Scheduled Gradual Reduction ( SGR ) Varenicline ( VN ) smoke cessation , assess abstinence level smoke 2 time point ( 4 12 week post quit ) . Aim 2 : To explore possibility SGR+VN particularly efficacious among smoker higher background level Cue Reactivity ( CR ) , assess start study , use classic experimental smoking CR paradigm . Aim 3 : To explore possible mechanism underlie effect SGR+VN , assess potential mediator ( i.e. , self-efficacy , cue-induced craving ) treatment effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Smoking Intervention Study Using Scheduled Gradual Reduction With Varenicline Help With Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking remain intransigent public health concern . There ample evidence non-pharmacological factor , environmental trigger ( e.g. , sight smell cigarette ) , give rise strong classically-conditioned urge smoke ( term 'cue-reactivity ' [ CR ] ) , exposure smoke cue contribute cessation failure . One promise intervention may address CR schedule smoke gradual reduction ( SGR ) . Under SGR , individual smoke fixed interval , several week , systematically decrease cigarette consume day . The approach postulate : 1 ) provide 'practice ' cop environmentally-triggered craving occur inter-cigarette interval , yield increase self-efficacy quit , 2 ) weaken association cue smoke . Accumulating evidence also show smoking cessation drug , varenicline ( VN ) , substantially ameliorate craving enhances cessation , significantly outperform drug . Interestingly , recent animal research suggest VN may operate least partially dampen condition drug craving . A combination therapy consist SGR+VN might thus lead significantly enhanced cessation , simultaneously attack craving use pharmacological non-pharmacological approach . Because beneficial effect SGR VN may least partially due enhance management condition craving , possible particularly efficacious smoker high level CR . Using laboratory experimental technique prospective intervention design R34 application , propose provide initial data : 1 ) test hypothesis combination SGR+VN enhance cessation , 2 ) explore possibility SGR VN might particularly efficacious among smoker high level CR , 3 ) explore potential mechanism underlie treatment effect . Findings study would set stage large efficacy effectiveness trial SGR alone conjunction VN , well effort target SGR and/or VN toward subgroup would benefit ( e.g. , smoker high level CR , carrier specific smoking-related genotype ) .</detailed_description>
