	<brief_summary>The main goal study perform standardized test tumor tissue learn gene mutate ( change ) provide personalized cancer therapy option patient MD Anderson . Your doctor may able use test information tumor identify clinical trial may relevant . Another goal laboratory research study learn often different gene mutate patient different cancer . Researchers also use information learn study develop database different kind mutation cancer-related gene . Researchers also hope good understand mutation cancer-related gene may affect patient 's response different therapy . Researchers use information select specific therapy future patient likely effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , information disease previous future treatment outcomes record medical record . A sample tumor tissue already collect store MD Anderson another institution collect . If tumor tissue store another institution , company call eHealth Global specialize pick deliver kind tissue , may use collect deliver sample MD Anderson . If eHealth Global use , may access certain identifiable health information , include accession number tissue sample , demographic information ( know pick sample ) , Medical Record Number ( use label sample laboratory know test ) . eHealth Global keep information use move sample outside institution MD Anderson . Your medical record information enter password-protected database access authorized member research staff treat physician MD Anderson . The tissue sample test look mutation cancer-related gene protein test . Any leftover DNA store research bank MD Anderson future research relate study . Before sample use research outside study , people research must get specific approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . All research do MD Anderson , include research involve sample bank , must first approve IRB . Your sample give code number . Researchers laboratory identify information directly link sample . However , researcher charge study team member , well oncologist able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . Other researcher use sample able link data . Some sample material may send institution outside MD Anderson advance test . Some sample may send outside institution company ( Guardant Health Inc. ) clinical laboratory improvement amendment ( CLIA ) -verified advanced testing . A CLIA-certified lab meet certain standard lab test ensure accuracy , reliability , timeliness patient test result regardless test perform . Your name sample identifier , along information sample disease necessary complete test provide along sample . The information CLIA-certified test do outside company institution become part medical record . If sample send outside institution standard research testing , identify information include sample . Results standard research test outside company institution include medical record receive information result test . Length Study : Your active participation sign consent form tissue blood sample collect . You medical record may continue review 20 year . This investigational study . Up 8,000 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically , radiographic , cytologically documented cancer , suspect glioma , sarcoma , melanoma hematologic cancer . Patients benign tumor may also consent discretion attend physician molecular profiling felt potential clinical implication . 2 . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 3 . Patients may consent without confirm amount quality archival diagnostic residual tissue available . However , research test perform patient sufficient archive diagnostic tissue residual tissue bank one authorize tissue bank MD Anderson available proceed test . The extent testing may modify base amount tissue available . If new tissue acquisition include biopsy and/or surgical resection etc . order clinical care another research study , operation perform test ordered sample . 4. cfDNA Cohort : Circulating cellfree DNA next generation sequencing ( NGS ) test perform CLIAcertified Guardant360 panel ( equivalent ) select patient . This particular cohort research collaboration support Guardant Health , Inc. charge MD Anderson . Patients consider enrollment clinical trial next 2 line therapy may enrol .</criteria>
