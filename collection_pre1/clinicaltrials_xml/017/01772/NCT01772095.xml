	<brief_summary>In 1906 , Dr. Alois Alzheimer first describe disease later take name . Today , 100 year later , 24 million people worldwide suffer Alzheimer 's disease dementia . The term 'dementia ' clinical use describe brain disorder cause decline mental function , memory first speech , judge overall behavior . Alzheimer 's disease far common form dementia , follow vascular dementia , dementia Lewy , frontotemporal dementia etc . In Greece 141,000 patient dementia . With increase life expectancy , figure expect increase dramatically future . Alzheimer 's disease common form dementia , well 50-60 % patient dementia suffer disease . The second common type dementia vascular , ie associate cerebrovascular disease 15-30 % dementia case common age 60-70 year common men woman . It estimate 5 % 8 % people 65 suffer dementia , industrialized country range follow level :15-25 % 85 32 % 90 year . Dementia characterize slow onset progressive course . The syndrome include disorder general intelligence , learn memory , problem solving , perception , judgment , executive function , language synergy movement , without impairment consciousness . Alzheimer 's disease neurodegenerative disorder distinct clinical histopathological feature , although variation person person . In early stage sometimes difficult diagnose cognitive impairment normal age brain . With passage time , continuous decline recent memory , fluency , ability spatial orientation ultimately restrict autonomy regard basic activity daily life manage finance . The anxiety depression complicate diagnosis early stage , gradually decline loss sensitivity . Intermediate stage disease require increasingly supervision daily self-care activity , personal hygiene clothing . In advanced stage usually essential nursing care institutional context . The severity symptoms disease varies determine premorbid factor education , gender , cultural background . Epidemiological study show protective factor onset dementia , high education , take estrogen anti-inflammatory drug . On hand , age , family history dementia , head injury , hypertension Down syndrome risk factor develop disease . Finally , genetic factor appear protective , pressure disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current treatment aim control symptoms disease . Important parameter early diagnosis early care . The delay onset symptom five year would reduce incidence disease 50 % per generation , complementary therapy delay entry institution would reduce cost considerably . This rationale medication , currently causative treatment . The cost dementia society intolerable year 2030 estimate 20 % population 65 . Thus e.g . cost $ 15 billion currently available U.S. care people dementia likely rise . Challenge tackle Alzheimer disease slow degenerative disease process , influence pharmaceutical intervention various parameter involve degeneration neuron , result short-time-charge patient 's cognition - possible load-relief family . Cholinesterase inhibitor document , effective treatment symptom Alzheimer disease therefore appropriate pharmaceutical intervention . Donepezil show help behavioral problem dementia . Aging Dementia Aging biological phenomenon lead irreversible morphologic change body system . The change relate nervous system eventually lead dementia . The population elderly people increase developed country , thereby create variety social , economic mainly medical problem . This find brought interest pathological condition manifest symptom qualitative similarity old age thus contribute expansion number group population also create diagnostic problem . Morphological , neurochemical neuropsychological change occur normal age dementia observe , especially Alzheimer . Dementias costly illness . In Europe today , cost care people dementia exceed cost illness heart disease , cancer stroke . The last 20 year tremendous advance prevention , diagnosis treatment dementia . Have significantly increase knowledge predispose factor disease , help prevent . The control vascular risk factor ( hypertension , obesity , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , smoke ) beneficial brain cardiovascular system . Diet low fat , fish vegetarian consumption associate decrease risk Disease Alzheimer . The diagnosis early clinical stage possible . An experienced physician diagnose Alzheimer 's certainty 90 % combine diagnostic tool disposal ( neuroimaging method , biomarkers , genetic testing ) . The pathological process brain patient Alzheimer 's disease begin decade appearance clinical symptom . The etiology probably multifactorial . Today intensively seek way identification candidate patient investigated possibility non-specific factor ( hormone , antioxidant vitamin , anti-inflammatory agent ) reverse delay pathogenic process . Intercultural , people less educated incidence dementia great . Specially-designed study show continue education adulthood increase cognitive reserve probably protect dementia . Those exercise spiritually ( study , read ) suffer Alzheimer 's disease less frequently milder form . Physical exercise fitness also contribute significantly prevention dementia . Today 's symptomatic treatment Alzheimer disease . Our experience drug call angiotensin cholinesterase ( ARICEPT , EXELON , REMINYL ) NMDA antagonist ( EBIXA ) demonstrate early initiation treatment significantly slow disease progression Alzheimer , dementia syndrome ( Vascular mix dementia , dementia Lewy body Alzheimer 's Dementia Parkinson ) . There also non-drug approach patient exercise involve memory attention , cognitive empowerment program , therapy memory orientation reality . Knowledge empowerment program aim exploitation cognitive function patient remain satisfactory level . By use wide variety stimulus specialize method appropriately stimulate brain patient achieve desire result . The dementia early stage easy diagnose public confuses symptom normal age . Still prevalent misconception nothing help patient . Recent study show demented patient usually examine specialist 3 year experience first symptoms disease . This delay diagnosis treatment negative impact progress disease . Accurate early diagnosis dementia , ensure early intervention , smooth transition stage disease good quality life patient family longer period time . It also allow targeted prevention treatment strategy , medical otherwise .</detailed_description>
