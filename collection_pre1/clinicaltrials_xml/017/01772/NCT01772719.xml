	<brief_title>Overcoming Chemotherapy Resistance In Refractory Multiple Myeloma With Simvastatin Zoledronic Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize addition simvastatin zoledronic acid bortezomib , thalidomide , melphalan dexamethasone base regimen decrease drug resistance treat refractory multiple myeloma . We hypothesize addition simvastatin zoledronic acid increase chemotherapy toxicity significantly tolerable patient . We believe simvastatin zoledronic acid antitumor property contribute reversal resistance . Treatment significantly enhance agent combine</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. definitive diagnosis Multiple Myeloma ( use International Myeloma Working Group Guidelines ) . 2. meet one follow two requirement : Have achieve minimal response ( MR ) stable disease ( SD ) current treatment regimen minimum two cycle . Have partial response show improvement paraprotein level late two measurement . 3. must measurable active symptomatic disease . Measurable disease may paraprotein free light chain serum urine , presence bone marrow plasma cell , define one follow criterion : Presence serum Mprotein concentration &gt; 1g/dL . Urine Mprotein excretion &gt; 200mg 24hour urine collection . Serum free light chain concentration ≥ 10mg/dL abnormal kappa/lambda ratio . Urine free light chain concentration ≥ 100mg/L abnormal kappa/lambda ratio . Bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥ 30 % ( detectable Mprotein FLC . ) 4 . Age &gt; 18 year age . 5 . If female reproductive capacity : effective mean birth control entire duration treatment . 6 . Patients must recover acute toxicity result therapy administer prior enter study grade 1 less ( CTCAE 4 ) Alopecia may resolve . 7 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 8 . Life expectancy great 8 week . 9 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . 10. adequate bone marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500/ul platelet &gt; 30,000/ul 11. adequate liver function define : total bilirubin &lt; 2 time upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 x upper limit normal 12. adequate renal function define creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min ( measure estimate CockcroftGault formula ) . 13. sign significant rhabdomyolysis determine CPK level CK &lt; 5 time upper limit normal . 1. receive chemotherapy treatment multiple myeloma prior enrol study . 2. show progressive disease tolerate current chemotherapy regimen . 3. receive simvastatin ( dose &gt; 40mg/day ) receive current chemotherapy regimen multiple myeloma . 4. fail progress two chemotherapy regimen , include current treatment ; prior enrol study . 5. receive investigational agent ( ) . 6 . Active second malignancy last 5 year except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinomainsitu . 7 . Pregnant woman ineligible , treatment involve unforeseeable risk embryo fetus . Female patient reproductive capacity require use effective mean birth control entire duration treatment . 8 . History hypersensitivity reaction attribute simvastatin zoledronic acid . 9. receive medication may increase risk rhabdomyolysis itraconazole , ketoconazole , erythromycin , cyclosporine , amiodarone , verapamil , clarithromycin , nefazodone , ranolazine , HIV protease inhibitor , gemfibrozil , posaconazole , danazol , amiodarone , diltiazem amlodipine . 10 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myopathy , untreated hypothyroidism , hereditary myopathy family history , unstable angina pectoris , liver disease due multiple myeloma , cardiac arrhythmia symptomatic rate control , active connective tissue disease , active autoimmune disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
