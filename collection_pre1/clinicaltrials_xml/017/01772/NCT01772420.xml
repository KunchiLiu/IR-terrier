	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well lenalidomide eltrombopag olamine work treat patient symptomatic anemia low intermediate myelodysplastic syndrome . Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Eltrombopag olamine may increase number white blood cell platelets find bone marrow peripheral blood . Giving lenalidomide eltrombopag olamine may effective treatment myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Eltrombopag Olamine Treating Patients With Symptomatic Anemia Low Intermediate Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate rate hematologic improvement eltrombopag ( eltrombopag olamine ) /lenalidomide combination ( per Modified International Working Group [ IWG ] criterion ) . II . To evaluate safety tolerability combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare time hematologic improvement . II . To evaluate duration hematologic improvement III . To evaluate effect combination treatment platelet count , platelet transfusion bleed event . IV . To evaluate frequency bone marrow response ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) cytogenetic response . V. To evaluate relationship mutation bone marrow stem cell response . VI . To evaluate relationship various stem progenitor alteration response . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients platelet count &gt; = 50,000 receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily every day ( QOD ) day 1-21 . If platelet count fall 50,000 , patient discontinue lenalidomide receive eltrombopag olamine PO daily QOD platelet count maintain 50,000 2 week . Patients resume lenalidomide PO daily QOD . If platelet fall 50,000 , patient receive eltrombopag olamine . When platelet count maintain 50,000 2 week , patient resume lenalidomide concurrently eltrombopag subsequent course . ARM B : Patients platelet count &lt; 50,000 receive eltrombopag olamine PO daily QOD day 1-28 platelet count maintain 50,000 2 week . Patients receive treatment Arm A . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
