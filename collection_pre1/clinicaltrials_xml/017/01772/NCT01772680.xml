	<brief_title>Zinc Diabetes Patients With Thalassemia : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Thalassemia major ( Thal ) require frequent blood transfusion risk iron overload . High tissue iron increase risk various endocrinopathies , include diabetes , well cardiovascular disease , infection due formation free radical . This systemic condition oxidative stress elicits antioxidant response reduce tissue damage . Zinc important component response compete iron multiple cellular binding site , therefore , reduce redox-cycling iron minimize iron-mediated oxidation lipid , protein , DNA . In Thal patient chronic hepatic iron overload , tissue zinc redistribution likely persistent . This could create unbalanced tissue zinc distribution excessive amount liver deficient level tissue alter zinc-dependent function , growth , skeletal development , immunity , glucose regulation . There rich body literature focus 'diabetogenic effect ' alter zinc status review herein . Our group recently show supplementation 25 mg/d zinc improve bone density patient Thal . This provide evidence functional zinc deficiency , may also affect whole body zinc function , insulin secretion glucose homeostasis . Our hypothesis hepatic iron overload induce sub-clinical inflammatory response alters expression MT zinc-transport protein lead hepatic zinc sequestration , associate zinc-depletion tissue . Marginal zinc depletion turn lead increase oxidative stress , cellular apoptosis alter glucose homeostasis insulin secretion . This proposal focus cross-sectional difference marker glucose homeostasis zinc status diabetic non-diabetic Thal patient , combine short- term zinc supplementation explore effect glucose insulin homeostasis .</detailed_description>
