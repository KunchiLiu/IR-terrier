	<detailed_description>The overall goal study correlate host viral genetics patient infected viral hepatitis clinical presentation . This study provide first nation-wide estimate key host genetic polymorphism associate immune response , IL28B gene locus associate treatment outcome hepatitis C. Characterization HCV HBV viral genotype sub-types across different geographic region allow exploration association host viral genotype . Another objective study identify co-morbid illness metabolic factor associate chronic liver disease due viral hepatitis . Finally , survey explore patient awareness disease , risk factor disease progression , treatment option</detailed_description>
