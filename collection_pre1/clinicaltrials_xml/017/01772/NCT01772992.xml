	<brief_summary>Men sex men ( MSM ) continue heavily-impacted risk group US HIV epidemic . Studies suggest majority incident HIV infection among MSM attributable sex main male sex partner . However , HIV prevention intervention target male-male couple lack . Because , Couples HIV Voluntary Counseling Testing ( CVCT ) , intervention repeatedly show reduce HIV transmission within heterosexual couple , adapt US MSM couple . Additionally , novel evidence demonstrate antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) reduce morbidity mortality among HIV-positive person , also serve reduce risk HIV transmission negative partner 96 % . As adherence ART modifiable level peer support show increase ART adherence , current study proposes use CVCT combine dyadic adherence counseling ( `` CVCTPlus '' ) improve linkage care , retention care , ART adherence , viral suppression among male-male couple use cohort 350 serodiscordant ( one HIV ( + ) partner , one HIV ( - ) partner ) couple great Atlanta , Chicago , Boston area . Prospective couple ( 175 arm ) follow two year . At visit , receive HIV testing , partner complete study survey measure social behavioral factor may influence adherence , couple 's cop ability concordance agreement regard outside sex partner .

	<detailed_description>Since early report AIDS United States , men sex men ( MSM ) , continue , heavily impact risk group US HIV epidemic . In 2009 , MSM account 61 % new HIV diagnosis , increase 53 % HIV incidence 2006 . The `` test treat '' strategy HIV infection entail universal test immediate treatment test seropositive , aim achieve viral suppression among positive . The efficacy treatment prevention demonstrate HPTN 052 reinvigorate discussion use `` test treat '' strategy reduce incidence HIV infection US . However , engagement-in-care research raise note caution regard potential pitfall effectiveness strategy . The recently publish MMWR `` Vital Signs '' Report , show 28 % HIV-infected person US suppress viral load . The estimate publish Gardner show estimate 1.1 million person infected HIV United States , 21 % HIV-infected person currently undiagnosed . Of diagnosed , loss occur initial linkage care later care 50 % remain care , 19 % HIV-infected person US currently viral load limit assay detection . There substantial evidence role couple - main partnership - fuel HIV epidemic among MSM US . A recent CDC analysis find 68 % new infection among MSM US ascribe main sex partner , proportion new infection main sex partner even high among young MSM . Led Sullivan Stephenson , recent work illustrate feasibility enrol couple HIV prevention effort demand couples-focused service among MSM . A response grow demand couples-focused service adaptation Couples Voluntary Counseling Testing ( CVCT ) MSM US . A recent NIMH-funded RCT CVCT versus traditional VCT among MSM ( Sullivan PI ) show 22 % MSM couple sero-discordant . This collective evidence provide foundation propose activity . We know significant proportion new HIV infection occur within couple , know current level linkage care , retention care adherence ARVs par among US MSM . In April 2012 , WHO release new guideline Couples HIV test counseling , include ARV treatment prevention among sero-discordant couple [ 7 ] . The guideline report significant gap evidence around uptake adherence ARV among couple , role CVCT shape uptake adherence ARVs : propose research potential add significantly understanding issue . The proposed activity investigate utility CVCT combine dyadic adherence counsel improve linkage care , retention care adherence ARVs . Through screen 350 MSM couple enrollment couple RCT , study aim examine impact CVCTPlus ( CVCT plus dyadic adherence counseling ) versus current standard care ( individual testing ) linkage HIV care , retention HIV care , adherence ARV achievement viral suppression among sero-discordant MSM couple . The specific aim : Primary Aims : 1. . Aim 1 : Examine test together HIV receive dyadic adherence counseling ( Partner-STEPS ) increase linkage care define : within three month HIV diagnosis , ( 1 ) least one clinical care appointment , ( 2 ) least one CD4 count test perform , ( 3 ) least one viral load test perform ii . Aim 2 : Examine test together HIV receive dyadic adherence counseling ( Partner-STEPS ) increase retention care , define : within past 12 month , ( 1 ) least two routine HIV care visit least three month apart , ( 2 ) two CD4 test , ( 3 ) two viral load test iii . Aim 3 : Examine test together HIV receive dyadic adherence counseling ( Partner-STEPS ) increase adherence anti-retroviral therapy reduction viral load / achievement viral suppression iv . Aim 4 : Examine test together HIV decrease sexual risk-taking within dyad outside sexual partner v. Aim 5 : Examine test together increase couple ' cop communication ability Hypothesis : Couples receive package CVCT dyadic-focused adherence intervention achieve great linkage care , retention care , adherence ARVs viral suppression couple receive standard care ( individualized VCT adherence counseling ) . With increase evidence role ARVs reduce HIV transmission , MSM couple represent significant target group new intervention . The proposed activity provide new information demonstrate efficacy use couples-based approach increase ARV adherence care seek among couple .</detailed_description>
