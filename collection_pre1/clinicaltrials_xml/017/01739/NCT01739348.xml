	<brief_summary>This study consist two part , Part I Part II . The purpose Part I study assess efficacy safety verubecestat ( MK-8931 ) compare placebo administer 78 week treatment Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . The primary study hypotheses Part I least one verubecestat dose superior placebo 78 week treatment respect change Baseline Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) score least one verubecestat dose superior placebo 78 week treatment respect change Baseline Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study Activities Daily Living Inventory ( ADCS-ADL ) score . The first approximately 400 participant enter Part I study identify Safety Cohort . Participants complete Part I study may choose participate Part II , long term double-blind extension ass efficacy safety verubecestat administer additional 260 week .</brief_summary>
