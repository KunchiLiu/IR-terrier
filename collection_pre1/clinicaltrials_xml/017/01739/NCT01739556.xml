	<brief_summary>Adequate platelet inhibition dual antiplatelet therapy key therapeutic goal primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) , aim protect stent thrombosis increase mortality . Recent aggregometric assay show one third acute coronary syndrome patient treat clopidogrel incomplete inhibition adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -induced platelet aggregation number patient treat aspirin incomplete inhibition thromboxane A2-induced platelet aggregation ( ASPI ) much low . High on-treatment platelet reactivity ( HTPR ) associate increased rate ischemic event PCI . However , recent large trial show clinical benefit TPR-guided therapy modification acute coronary syndrome patient treat PCI . On-treatment PLAtelet reactivity-guided Therapy modification FOR ST-segment elevation Myocardial infarction ( PLATFORM ) investigator-initiated , prospective , randomize , parallel-group , control clinical trial design test hypothesis antiplatelet therapy modification superior standard antiplatelet regimen among intermediate high-risk STEMI patient undergo PPCI . The safety hypothesis compare control arm , interventional study arm similar rate non-coronary artery bypass graft surgery-related bleeding . Approximately 632 ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient intermediate high-risk ( RISK-PCI score &gt; 3 ) clinical feature undergo PPCI randomly allocate treatment modification standard treatment . Low responder aspirin receive 200 mg aspirin 30 day . Low responder clopidogrel receive 180 mg ticagrelor 1 year . Patients follow 1 year PPCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On-treatment PLAtelet reactivity-guided Therapy modification FOR ST-segment elevation Myocardial infarction ( PLATFORM ) investigator-initiated , prospective , open-label , randomize , parallel-group , actively control single-centre clinical trial . The research protocol approve Ethics Committee Clinical Centre Serbia . All participant provide informed consent writing . The trial design ensure participant abide good clinical practice ethical principle Declaration Helsinki II . Patients randomly allocate antiplatelet regimen modification ( ARM , interventional arm ) standard treatment ( control arm ) use computer-generated 1:1 simple randomization scheme . TPR assess patient enrol intervention arm trial . Low responder aspirin receive 200 mg aspirin 30 day . Low responder clopidogrel receive 180 mg ticagrelor 1 year . Patients enrol control arm receive standard antiplatelet regimen include 100 mg aspirin 75 mg clopidogrel without assessment TPR . The treat physician blind intervention since open design make possible investigator perform necessary adjustment antiplatelet regimen accordance TPR status . To minimize possible bias inherent open design , endpoint evaluate blind endpoint committee . Enrollment start June 2013 . Recruitment continue 632 patient randomize . The end recruitment period plan June 2015 . The trial continue available survivor follow least 1 year . Aspirin 300 mg clopidogrel 600 mg loading dos administer early possible PPCI . Primary PCI perform via femoral radial approach , use standard 6 French-7 French guide catheter . The Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) blood flow measure two experienced observer blind identity order angiogram . Any disagreement resolve third observer . Unfractionated heparin start 100 IU/kg bolus ( 60 IU/kg glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor use ) ; 12 IU/kg/h infusion follow clinically indicate . Proton-pump inhibitor pantoprazole H2-blocker ranitidine give select patient risk gastrointestinal hemorrhage . GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor tirofiban administer procedure patient evidence high intracoronary thrombus burden accord European Society Cardiology guideline . Multiple electrode aggregometry perform use impedance aggregometer monitor official representative manufacturer ( Multiplate analyzer , Verum-Diagnostics , Munich , Germany ) . TPR result evaluate 2 investigator blind patient 's identity treatment . Whole blood sample 24 hour load dose . In patient receive IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban blood sample obtain least 24 hour completion tirofiban infusion . On-treatment platelet reactivity ( TPA ) 50 % , compare basal value estimate TRAP test , link low responsiveness . Patients followed-up discharge hospital net adverse event 1 year enrolment schedule telephone interview outpatient visit . Interviewers blind randomization scheme result platelet aggregation . An independent Clinical Event Committee , compose 3 cardiologist 1 neurologist blind respect randomization allocation review adjudicate occurrence suspect clinical end point . Interim analyse efficacy futility , use O'Brian-Fleming guideline group sequential design , plan one fourth , one half three fourth maximum number 632 patient followed-up 30 day . Interim analysis safety data review independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee , compose chairman , statistician , 2 physician member .</detailed_description>
