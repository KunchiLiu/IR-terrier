	<detailed_description>This project conduct type 2 diabetic patient . Patients meet eligibility criterion randomize SC CALM-D condition , include diet exercise counsel cop skill train part intend facilitate medication adherence . Both CALM-D SC patient prescribe antidepressant well medication . Because patient retention adherence protocol major emphasis project , intend use 3 session `` run-in '' prior randomization . Patients appear medically eligible , meet study criterion major depression , express willingness participate return session patient complete medical history form , undergoes brief physical exam , take maximum exercise stress test , give standardize dietary assessment , taught use food diary activity monitor . At begin third run-in session , patient return complete food diary , data activity monitor record . The patient take 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) time answer question health habit , psychosocial functioning health quality life . After brief rest snack patient escort Ultrasound Laboratory assessment echocardiography , carotid artery image brachial artery endothelial functioning . Patients satisfactorily complete three run-in session , meet eligibility requirement interested participating , ask provide inform consent randomize CALM-D SC condition . Randomization implement use stratified randomized block design . Eight stratum designate basis age ( &lt; 50 v ≥ 50 year ) , severity depression ( &lt; 24 v ≥ 24 HRSD ) , glycemic control ( &lt; 8 v ≥ HbA1c ) baseline . Within stratum , random sequence generate block size 2 , 4 6 . The block size also randomly choose . In manner result sequence look purely random , fairly closely balanced respect critical variable age , depression severity diabetes ( Piantadosi , 1997 ) . Elements random sequence pair subject number participant assign stratum . The number sequence generate stratum vary depend number eligible participant stratum . These sequence conceal treatment condition actually assign . The SC patient treat accordance ADA Clinical Practice Guidelines ( 2005 ) , include least 2 HbA1c test , lipid profile , test microalbuminuria , dilate retinal eye exam , complete foot exam influenza immunization year plus prescribed aspirin therapy , screen readiness stop smoking smoke . Smokers encourage stop , use ADA recommendation Guidelines . In addition , patient 's physician receive baseline , 6 month 1 year , report include OGTT , insulin resistance , oxidative stress , inflammation , lipid profile , endothelial function , rest blood pressure , cardiac vascular function , cardiac morphology , psychosocial functioning health quality life . Participants CALM-D condition receive , also 2 individual counseling session ( ) get start , active , lose weight manage stress ; ( b ) negative thought emotion include discussion way curb emotional eating . Following 2 individual session 2 weekly group session follow 4 bi-weekly session 9 monthly session . Each session CALM-D 1 hour long include deep breathing relaxation ( 5 min ) , homework review include medication adherence , activity level , fat caloric intake ( 10 min ) , session topic homework assignment ( 45 min ) . The group topic include issue `` Where 's Fat ? /Three Ways Eat Less Fat '' `` Taking Your Medications/Stress You . '' Although participant interventionists aware patient 's treatment assignment , staff collect , verify classify end point data follow-up assessment mask much possible . The primary outcome study : ) depression ; ( b ) weight waist circumference ; ( c ) HbA1c ; ( ) medication adherence . Secondary outcome include : ( ) glucose tolerance , ( b ) insulin resistance , ( c ) inflammation , ( ) fibrinolysis , ( e ) lipid profile , ( f ) oxidative stress , ( g ) endothelial function , ( h ) rest blood pressure , ( ) cardiac vascular function , ( j ) cardiac morphology , ( k ) psychosocial functioning , ( l ) health quality life . The variable assess baseline , 6 month 1 year . Data analyze use mixed-model analysis determine change time function experimental condition . This do use PROC Mixed module SAS software ( Littell , Milliken , Stroup , &amp; Wolfinger , 1996 ) . This methodology useful intent treat analysis require complete data across multiple time point . Approximately 50 % patient intend recruit likely Latino/Hispanic ; base previous experience , Latino/Hispanic participant prefer speak , write , answer question Spanish . All instrument propose available Spanish . To large extent , CALM-D intervention develop present project base DPP ENRICHD protocol . We recognize , course , language ethnicity . However , great deal diversity among Latino/Hispanics patient sample enrol Jackson Health Care System include Cubans , Colombians , Puerto Ricans , Nicaraguans , Dominicans , Mexicans , Peruvians Guatamalans among others . During 2 hour OGTT participant complete questionnaire include : ) Medical History Form ( e.g. , demographic , risk factor , comorbid illness , medication ) ; ( b ) health habit ( e.g. , smoking , alcohol use ; physical activity ) ; ( c ) psychosocial functioning ( e.g. , BDI , DISH ) ; ( ) health quality life . In addition provide measure blood glucose plasma insulin , blood draw permit assessment HbA1c , inflammation , fibrinolysis , lipid . After OGTT assessor provide participant snack allow brief rest period . Then RD conduct dietary assessment record data activity monitor . The participant escort Ultrasound Laboratory assessment echocardiography , carotid artery image brachial artery endothelial function . At completion session participant report Assessors , review day event , thank participate pay $ 100 reimbursement time transportation . Physical measure . Activity monitor . Between second third week run-in ( Baseline ) 1 week 6 month 12 month assessment participant wear activity monitor physical activity . The participant also complete Blair ( 1984 ) questionnaire one-week period . Participants CALM-D condition remind one week prior 17 intervention session wear accelerometer daily bring next session . We intend use New Lifestyle NL-2000 activity monitor . This device weigh .25 ounce , count step estimate calorie burn . The caloric estimate subtracts calorie burn maintenance adjusts intensity base upon step per unit time . This device 7 day automatic memory start midnight zero . Albuminuria . Albumin creatinine measure 2nd run-in/assessment /Baseline session urine sample ( see Core B ) . Serum creatinine also measure . Patients exclude evidence renal disease ( i.e. , urine dipstick protein 4+ ; serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL woman 1.5 mg/dL men ; currently receive dialysis ) . In patient meet criterion entry study , incidence progression microalbuminuria great level excretion assess use albumin/creatinine ratio 6 month 12 month follow-up . Serum creatinine also measure time . Cardiorespiratory fitness . Fitness evaluate Baseline ( second run-in/assessment session ) 6- 12-month follow-up maximal treadmill test ( see Core C ) . The Baseline symptom-limited maximum stress test represent current standard care exercise prescription . The primary measure assess change change maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ) . Heart rate , ECG change , blood pressure VO2 max determine exercise test . For maximum exercise stress test participant continue prescribed medication cardiovascular disease . The follow 3 abnormality classify individual moderate high risk cardiac complication exercise result study exclusion : 1 ) 2 previous myocardial infarction ; ( 2 ) previous episode primary cardiac arrest ; ( 3 ) exercise capacity &lt; 6 METS , ( 4 ) ischemic horizontal downsloping ST segment depression ≥ 4.0 mm , ( 5 ) angina exercise ( see Core C detail ) . Diabetes control . CALM-D include measurement HbA1c , fast glucose , response oral glucose challenge Baseline ( run-in/assessment session 2 ) , 6- 12-month follow-up . Patients exclude Baseline HbA1c &gt; 11 % . Psychosocial measure Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . The BDI ( Beck , 1967 ) tap several domain depression . Of 21 item scale , 11 deal cognition , 2 affect , 2 overt behavior , 1 interpersonal symptom 5 somatic symptom . In overweight , type 2 diabetic patient , somatic symptom may reflect physical disease process ( e.g. , fatigue inflammation rather primary depression . For reason , subanalyses separate effect intervention somatic v nonsomatic item important . The BDI use extensively English , Spanish various European speaking population internal reliability α = .85-.93 ( e.g. , Sanz &amp; Vázquez , 1993 ) . Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) . The PSS ( Cohen , S. &amp; Williamson , G. , 1988 ) 10 item scale measure degree situation people 's life perceive stressful ( unpredictable , uncontrollable , overwhelming ) good reliability ( α = .85 ) . Cook-Medley Hostility Scale ( Ho ) . The Ho scale ( Cook &amp; Medley , 1954 ) compose 50 true-false item take MMPI measure cynicism mistrust others adequate test -retest reliability , internal consistency , construct validity ( Smith , 1992 ) . It show number large scale prospective study associate increase risk CHD ( Miller et al. , 1996 ) . Coping . The Brief Cope ( Carver , 1997 ) use assess cop strategy may moderate CALM-D intervention effect . This instrument demonstrate high internal consistency , adequate stability time substantial convergent validity . Based previous study use Cope , shall look follow 2 item subscales : ( 1 ) active coping ; ( 2 ) use emotional support ; ( 3 ) use instrumental support ; ( 4 ) behavioral disengagement . Subscales 1 , 2 , 3 also use composite measure . Perceived Social Support Scale ( PSSS ) . The PSSS ( Blumenthal et al. , 1987 ) 12-item scale address perceive support family , friends significant others . It establish reliability relate CHD . Health quality life Health Status Questionnaire , Short Form ( SF-36 ) . The SF-36 ( Ware &amp; Sherbourne , 1992 ) 36-item instrument 8 multi-item scale : ( 1 ) physical functioning ; ( 2 ) social functioning ; ( 3 ) role limitation due physical health problem ; ( 4 ) role limitation due personal emotional problem ; ( 5 ) general mental health ; ( 6 ) vitality ; ( 7 ) bodily pain ; ( 8 ) general health perception . Subscale reliabilities 0.8 multiple population study conduct adult . It successfully use evaluate functional status depress , chronically ill , healthy individual ( Wells et al. , 1989 ) . Intervention . In present project participant : ( ) meet diagnostic criterion major depressive disorder , unless currently prescribe antidepressant medication prior diagnosis depression current BDI score &gt; 11 . It note patient type 2 diabetes approximately risk MI patient already MI diabetes ( Haffner et al. , 1998 ) . During study half participant , depress , randomize CALM-D intervention half standard care . The CALM-D intervention consist 17 session . The first 4 session meet weekly . Sessions 1 2 individual session counselor participant get know one another build rapport . They also provide participant opportunity ask question , describe potential barrier express reservation . Sessions 3 4 , also meet weekly , encourage participant get know one another deal issue concern diet medication adherence . After first 4 weekly session , participant meet 4 biweekly session follow 9 monthly session . One week prior bi-weekly monthly session , therapist call remind participant next meeting request participant wear accelerometer fill-out food diary daily upcoming session . Immediately prior CALM-D intervention session , participant weigh , accelerometer result record food diary turn . Upon initial randomization intervention condition session 1 , participant tell invite ask partner , family member living household friend come intervention session .

G Ways Stay Motivated Abbreviations : I = Individual session ; G = Group session The objective intervention participant : ) lose 7 % weight healthy eating ; ( b ) 2.5 hr brisk , physical activity wk ( e.g. , walk briskly 30 min 5x per week ) ; ( c ) manage stress well ( e.g. , cop strategy ; deep breathing ) ; ( ) always take medication . Participants also teach fill food diary . At outset intervention counselor discus effect excess weight diabetes complication diabetes decrease improved diet increase activity level . In term diet , participant teach : use fat counter read label ; weigh measure food ; eat less fat ; change eat habit well match food pyramid ; choose healthy eating behavior ; make healthy food choice eating ; relate calorie balance weight loss . To promote physical activity participant discuss : current activity level ; benefit active ; possible activity undertake regularly ; overcome barrier activity ; way prevent injury . The participant also learn use accelerometer . Later program patient learn definition aerobic fitness relationship frequency , intensity , time type activity . Ways add interest variety activity plan also discuss . As precursor learn manage stress , participant teach identify type negative think relationship among thought , emotion way curb emotional eating . The counselor also stimulate discussion failure take prescribed antidepressant lead mood related physical inactivity unhealthy health behavior ( e.g. , excessive alcohol use ; overeat ) . Participants teach : ass negative thought accurate ; replace inaccurate negative thought accurate thought ; handle situation one ca n't fix problem ; identify source emotional tangible support use effectively ; prevent stress ; cope stress . The intervention also deal need handle lapse relapse regard diet , physical activity , depression , medication adherence . Participants teach identify high-risk situation early warn sign well use adaptive coping strategy . Specific strategy achieve weight loss goal . A weight loss goal 7 % set , lead loss 7-21 lb within 24 week . Participants weigh private session record weight graph participant 's notebook . Participants encourage , possible , weigh outside study venue . A total fat intake goal set base upon 25 % total calorie fat . A total caloric intake goal also set . Daily self-monitoring food intake ( fat calorie ) request participant food measuring tool fat calorie counter provide . A simplified form self-monitoring provide participant limited read math skill . Specific strategy achieve physical activity goal . A physical activity goal 700 kilocalorie per week ( 2.5 hour moderate activity ) set step-wise fashion reach 5-weeks . Another goal reach 10,000 step per week record accelerometer . Participants ask maintain daily physical activity record diary base information accelerometer . Sites physical activity safely effectively undertaken identify participant , base residence . Specific strategy achieve medication adherence goal . Participants list medication take keep list notebook . The purpose medication explain participant well reason always take medication day prescribe . Participants encourage develop habit take medication prescribed time day . Discussions handle weekend , go vacation , etc . discuss intervention session . Reminders take medication offer session phone call . Refills medication carefully track . When participant report run low medication encourage obtain refill promptly . Reported side effect medication carefully monitor attempt make determine side effect easily remedied ( e.g. , take bedtime , take breakfast ) due follow instruction correctly . If necessary participant refer physician consideration change medication . Counselors supervision . The counselor propose use intervention license Ph.D. Clinical psychologist , serve counselor post-MI project adolescent intervention project present program project . Supervision carry Dr. Patrice Saab , Ph.D. , help develop intervention protocol , receive supervisory training Beck Institute conjunction ENRICHD trial Dr. Ronald Goldberg , M.D. , P.I . Miami site DPP . Based weekly review audiotaped session , Dr. Saab determine , use protocol check list , intervention adherence manual , point drift lack fidelity protocol offer professional suggestion remediate problem . Using standard develop DPP , Dr. Goldberg assure counselor adhere protocol regard issue use fat counter , weigh measure food , use food pyramid supervise exercise food diary homework . Weekly supervision institutionalize component intervention program . Study hypotheses relate Primary aim association . In accordance specific aim hypothesize : ( From Primary Aim 1 ) . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show significantly great improvement BDI depression score compare participant SC condition . The great improvement BDI score CALM-D SC condition mediate increased medication adherence improve cop skill CALM-D participant . ( From Primary Aim 2 ) . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show significantly great weight loss participant SC condition . The great weight loss CALM-D SC condition mediate decreased depression , increase adherence dietary instruction increase physical activity . ( From Primary Aim 3 ) . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show significantly low HbA1c SC condition . The great decrease HbA1c CALM-D SC condition mediate great weight loss , improved nutrition increase exercise . ( From Primary Aim 4 ) . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show significantly great medication adherence participant SC condition . The great increase anti-depressant medication adherence CALM-D SC condition mediate improved coping skill increase perceive social support . The great increase adherence prescribed medication anti-depressants CALM-D SC condition mediate decreased depression improve cop skill . Study hypotheses relate secondary aim . In accordance study 's secondary aim hypothesize : Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show significantly improve insulin sensitivity tolerance oral glucose challenge compare participant SC condition . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show improved procoagulation endothelial function decrease inflammation oxidative stress compare participant SC condition . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show improve lipid profile compare participant SC condition . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show lower rest blood pressure improve cardiac vascular function well cardiac morphology compare participant SC condition . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show improve psychosocial functioning compare participant SC condition . Participants enrol CALM-D intervention show improve health quality life compare participant SC condition . The great improvement improve tolerance oral glucose challenge , insulin sensitivity , procoagulation , oxidative stress , lipid profile , endothelial function , rest blood pressure , cardiac vascular function , cardiac morphology health quality life associate decreased waist circumference . Statistical analysis . Preliminary analysis . All data inspect employ quality control procedure . Descriptive statistic compute every study variable ensure data value within expect range eliminate data error may occur . If need , event variable normally distribute , transform variable use log transformation use non-parametric statistic . A mixed model analysis program ( use SAS Proc Mixed ) growth model use assess 4 primary hypothesis . Missing data handle use full information likelihood algorithm , use data available participant . To assess secondary hypothesis , structural equation model use . The secondary analysis conduct across several domain , model latent variable . Control variables . The stratified randomized block design lead comparable group respect key variable interest , namely age , depression level diabetes control baseline . To extent group heterogeneous respect variable , include model covariates reduce within group variability increase power . Gender ethnicity may also include model dummy cod variable . Test Primary Hypothesis . Because project involve longitudinal design 2 condition measure multiple time use mixed model test primary hypothesis . This approach allow u compare SC CALM-D condition trajectory change primary ( i.e. , BDI , weight , HbA1c , medication adherence ) variable . Additionally , mixed model allow u incorporate relevant covariates specify model . ( See Core D , fuller description model ) . In addition mixed model , use latent growth model assess indirect path test potential mediator relationship condition outcome variable . The program use analysis Mplus ( Muthen &amp; Muthen , 1998 ) . We use hypothesis driven test mediation . Briefly , compare nested model : one direct indirect path , second indirect path ( without direct path ) . If difference model ( use χ2 difference test ) significant n't need direct path , support hypothesis mediation . For example , ass whether significant CALM-D effect decrease depression due increase medication adherence . In Core D specify combine data across project test mediation . Power Analyses Power calculation specific aim include . All power calculation do use statistical software nQuery ( Elashoff , 2000 ) . Power present two group ( intervention vs. control design ) . In addition need calculate effect intervention primary endpoint , also concern need calculate power mediation hypothesis , consider exploratory .</detailed_description>
