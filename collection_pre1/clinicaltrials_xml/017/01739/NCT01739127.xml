	<brief_title>Comparison Aripiprazole Versus Higher Metabolic Risk Antipsychotic Drugs Adiposity Using MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Second generation antipsychotic drug much great efficacy refractory schizophrenia much low propensity induce motor side-effects . These medication see increase use indication psychosis , great use population adolescent . However , one critical issue field psychiatry today overwhelming evidence chronic use second generation antipsychotic result metabolic dysregulation , include weight gain , hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance . A recent meta-analysis indicate switch second generation antipsychotic antipsychotic drug aripiprazole consistently result significant weight loss may optimal treatment patient exhibit drug-induced weight gain . Therefore , aim compare metabolic dysregulation ( namely abdominal weight gain fat distribution ) participant take aripiprazole , participant take higher-metabolic propensity antipsychotic drug ( risperidone quetiapine ) , healthy participant .</detailed_description>
