	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety autologous human Schwann cell ( ahSC ) transplantation subject subacute SCI . For human subacute SCI , hypothesize axon might show improved function myelin repair induced implantation ahSC . In addition spinal cord cavitation may reduce , neural sprout plasticity may enhance via neurotrophic effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Autologous Human Schwann Cells ( ahSC ) Subjects With Subacute SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schwann cell excellent candidate transplantation human SCI . Large number ahSC derive autologous implantation minor surgery peripheral nerve harvesting , purification expansion cell culture . Autologous cell offer important safety advantage include need immune suppression , minimal risk disease transfer , low risk tumorigenicity . Since 1990 , scientist Miami Project Cure Paralysis generate extensive preclinical data suggest Schwann cell transplantation successful rodent SCI . The recent work focus contusive injury model relevant human injury . They also largely responsible develop efficient method procure large , essentially pure population human Schwann cell adult peripheral nerve . The rationale implantation ahSC people acute SCI base evidence Schwann cell neuroprotective capable myelinating axon . Using mitogen expand human Schwann cell SCID mouse athymic female nude rat demonstrate human Schwann cell survive capable enhance axonal regeneration form myelin transplantation animal sciatic nerve transection thoracic spinal cord transection . The proposed clinical trial advance knowledge safety feasibility cell-based treatment strategy human SCI . This Phase 1 clinical trial employ open label , unblinded , nonrandomized non-placebo control dose-escalation design evaluate safety transplantation ahSC transplantation subject subacute SCI . A sural nerve harvest occur within 30 day post-injury . Standard-of-care medical treatment rehabilitation proceed cell process cGMP facility . No later 72 day post-injury , ahSC product administer via single injection cavity spinal cord lesion . Safety efficacy assessment perform week 1 2 post-transplantation 2 , 6 , 12 month post-transplantation .</detailed_description>
