	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse common disorder result significant patient morbidity . Approximately 1 9 woman undergo surgery correction pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) associate bladder bowel dysfunction . Despite common occurrence , cause POP remain largely unknown . Prolapse think cause direct injury levator ani ( LA ) muscle , denervation pelvic floor musculature , fascial damage incur childbirth trauma . It evident pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) occur support pelvic floor becomes weaken stretch , usually cause childbirth , lead descent pelvic organ vagina beyond . This contribute impairment pelvic organ function deterioration patient quality life . POP estimate severely affect approximately 11 % female population . Symptomatic POP patient might benefit conservative management , use physiotherapy vaginal pessary . However , advance POP necessitates surgical reconstruction . This might achieve abdominal approach open operation laparoscopy , vaginal approach . Synthetic permanent absorbable mesh biological graft , synthesis might use reinforcement weaken pelvic floor structure lead POP . The need reinforcement weaken fascia achieve long lasting cure herniation process un-questionable . Given underlie pathology lead POP actually hernia pelvic floor , one must admit surgical principle use hernia repair applicable POP . Most adverse effect relate excessive implant mesh mass . Thus , goal study look issue reduce mesh size , surface area total mesh mass , assume less quantity leave implant less mesh related complication occur . The narrative notion natural pelvic floor connective tissue architecture ligamentary `` sheath like '' , available pre-cut mesh much wide spread . This study concept reduce mesh surface lead reduction mesh relate complication . Given mesh implant size reduce , also wide extent preliminary dissection , necessary proper mesh placement . Thus , dissection related adverse effect expect reduce well .</detailed_description>
