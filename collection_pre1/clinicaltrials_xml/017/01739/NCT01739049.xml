Gut-related peptide include ghrelin secrete stomach duodenum orexigenic ( appetite stimulating ) effect ; leptin secrete adipose tissue anorexic ( appetite inhibiting ) effect , cholecystokinin , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secrete proximal gastrointestinal tract slight anorexic effect , peptide YY ( PYY ) .
