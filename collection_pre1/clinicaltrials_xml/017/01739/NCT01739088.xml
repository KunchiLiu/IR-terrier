	<brief_summary>In 2012 , infant surgery congenital heart disease high survival . The investigator focus improve sick infant become surgery ( short term outcome ) later neurodevelopment ( long term outcome ) . During heart surgery , cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ; heart-lung machine ) take heart function surgeon repair heart disease . During surgery period time amount blood go heart brain lower usual , call `` ischemia '' . Once surgery finish blood go heart brain increase normal , call `` reperfusion '' . This ischemia-reperfusion cause injury heart , brain , organ , affect short long term outcomes infant . Adult study show short time ischemia legs 5-10 minute [ leg damage short time ischemia , unlike heart brain ] , severe ischemia another distant vulnerable vital organ [ like heart brain ] , protect vital organ ischemia-reperfusion injury . This call `` remote ischemic preconditioning '' ( RIPC ) . Our objective test whether RIPC heart surgery improve recovery heart brain heart surgery newborn baby congenital heart disease . The investigator test whether RIPC result lower peak lactate troponin level day heart surgery . Lactate level marker much different tissue body suffer ischemia-reperfusion injury . Troponin release damage heart ischemia-reperfusion . In trial infant randomize RIPC control . This mean baby equal chance one group . The intervention group RIPC surgery ; `` control group '' . The investigator hope trial lead large study test RIPC result few day breathe machine surgery , low mortality , high score neurodevelopmental test 2 year age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ischemic Preconditioning ( IPC ) refers phenomenon brief ischemia-reperfusion event tissue/organ result subsequent protection severe ischemia-reperfusion event tissue/organ . There many description IPC animal model . Protection occur two phase : early IPC ( &lt; 4hr ) , later IPC ( 24-72hr ) . The protection mark , reduction infarction size brain heart order 50 % . The late phase provide protection infarction ( lethal reperfusion injury ) stunning ( post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction ) , early phase provide protection infarction . The mechanisms IPC divide 4 phase : preconditioning insult , stress sensor , signal transduction , effector protection . Remote Ischemic PreConditioning ( RIPC ) refers find brief ischemia-reperfusion event tissue/organ result subsequent protection severe ischemia-reperfusion event different tissue/organ . This advantageous tissue subject precondition stimulus accessible less vulnerable target organ protect , brain heart . Animal study demonstrate efficacy RIPC . The mechanisms timing ( early late phase ) appear IPC . There several adult human study IPC . Studies IPC adult coronary bypass surgery find improvement acute marker myocardial injury hemodynamic function . A meta-analysis 22 trial IPC cardiac surgery adult find significant improvement postoperative arrhythmia , inotrope requirement , intensive care unit stay IPC group . There adult study show RIPC prevents ischemia-reperfusion injury . Currently , 3 large adult randomize control trial ( RCT ) underway investigate effect RIPC cardiac surgery stroke . There six study RIPC child . In one study 37 child cardiac surgery randomize RIPC induce low limb ischemia blood pressure cuff . The level troponin I inotrope requirement significantly great control group vs. RIPC group . In another study infant repair ventricular septal defect randomize receive RIPC 24 hr 1 hr CPB . The postoperative release cytokine heart enzymes attenuate , good lung heart function , adverse effect . A study child ventricular septal defect find early RIPC post-conditioning associate low level troponin I , creatinine kinase inotrope score post-operative . A recent RCT child undergo cardiac surgery find late RIPC associate low N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide difference inflammatory marker cardiac dysfunction . Similarly , recent small RCT RIPC find difference troponin I level short term outcome . The large RIPC pediatric RCT perform date involve 113patients expectation RIPC would reduce incidence acute kidney injury . This study find trend towards low incidence acute kidney injury RIPC group . The interpretation study difficult due small sample , multiple analysis without prestated primary secondary outcome . Recent review suggest study do large sample size . Potential Concerns Children : In immature rodent , precondition lipopolysaccharide , oxygen-glucose deprivation , result worse brain injury ischemia-reperfusion . This raise possibility harm IPC neonates . This unlikely following reason . First , data applies neonates &lt; 32 week post-conception age . Second , lipopolysaccharide protect brain give 4 hr 24hr ischemic event . Third , hypoxic precondition protective immature brain . Safety concern : Based discussion potential concern , study review , anticipate adverse effect RIPC . Discomfort RIPC mild treat sedation necessary . The dose midazolam give purpose show safe . Potential Interference Preconditioning : Animal study find beta-blockers , sulfonylurea , caffeine , aminophylline , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , naloxone interfere IPC . Patients drug exclude . There study show inhalational anesthetic pharmacologic precondition agent . The mechanism action involve pathway IPC . However , response IPC anesthetic preconditioning involve substantial subset gene unique precondition stimulus . Studies anesthetic preconditioning find conflict result suggest anesthetic preconditioning , occur , likely enhance IPC . Furthermore , clinical study promise result discuss , anesthetic use surgical procedure . Objectives : ) To demonstrate feasibility patient recruitment RIPC RCT center ; b ) determine effect RIPC early postoperative course infant cardiac surgery . We aim recruit 4 patients/month total 50 patient 1 year ; recruitment rate would make large trial feasible . Hypothesis : We hypothesize ) target patient recruitment feasible , b ) RIPC result 50 % reduction peak lactate level day 1 postoperatively . Study design : We propose pilot double blind randomize control trial . Randomization do computer base program ensure allocation concealment . A total 50 patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive RIPC stimulus control ( sham-RIPC ) . Concomitant medications/interventions : The cardioplegia solution use , dose steroid give operate room standardize order minimize possibility confounders . We use Sevoflurane inhalation agent , record dose duration study arm . Baseline variable : To sure group comparable know risk factor equally distribute among group , record following : demographic variable ( sex , gestational age , birth weight , weight surgery , age surgery , mother 's year school , father 's socioeconomic status ) ; preoperative variable ( cardiac diagnosis , cyanosis preoperatively ( oxygen saturation &lt; 85 % ) , single/biventricular heart physiology , day mechanical ventilation , inotrope score , low Pa02 , high lactate , high base deficit ) ; intraoperative variable ( lactate level troponin I level CPB , duration inhalational anesthetic , CPB time , aortic cross clamp time , DHCA use , DHCA duration , re-CPB operating room ) . Study procedure : When patient admit Stollery Children 's Hospital necessity heart surgery CPB establish , patient screen eligibility . Written inform consent ask . After consent , patient demographic baseline variable record . Eligible patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio intervention group control group . Randomization do computer base program Epidemiology Coordinating Research Centre ( EPICORE ) facilitate procedure ensure allocation concealment . As patient qualifies trial , study number randomization number assign . Follow visit : A follow visit schedule age 2 year . During follow-up visit certify pediatric psychologist , unaware patient randomize intervention control group , assess neurodevelopmental outcome subject tertiary site origin . Masking : This double blind study . The research nurse cover low body subject drape , whether cuff inflate around underneath leg know others . The people know patient allocation EPICOR research nurse perform intervention . Patient Withdrawal : A patient may withdraw study intolerable adverse event think related RIPC occurs , patient 's parent ( ) wish child withdrawn , clinician care patient site investigator believe best interest patient withdraw . Sample size justification : The primary outcome use determine sample size future large RCT Bayley III cognitive composite score 2 year post-operatively . The minimal clinically important difference Bayley III cognitive score half SD . This medium effect size usually consider indicate different class patient outcome . The Boston Circulatory Arrest trial design detect difference half standard deviation intelligence quotient , consider detect 6.5 point deficit Psychomotor Development Index Bayley ( 43 % SD ) clinically significant . Our data CPTP show mean Bayley III cognitive score 91 SD 16 . To detect 8 ( half SD ) point increase mean cognitive score 2 year alpha 0.05 power 0.8 , need 63 patient per group . In CPTP cohort study , loss follow &lt; 2 % 2 year , exclusion criterion meet 5 % eligible neonate 2009 . Loss follow unlikely patient need frequent follow visit pediatric cardiologist pediatrician . To account loss follow early withdrawal study plan enroll total 140 patient ( 70 patient group ) future study . The Stollery Children 's Hospital referral center pediatric cardiac surgery Western Canada , neonates heart surgery transfer Stollery preoperatively . The enrollment 50 patient 1 year pilot study would determine recruitment 140 patient 3 year feasible . Furthermore , base data center ( mean peak lactate level 4.6 , SD 2.4 ) sample size 50 patient allow u detect 50 % reduction peak lactate level day 1 post-operative alpha ( two side ) 0.05 0.9 power . Statistical Analysis : Demographic baseline characteristic analyze descriptive method . We analyze outcome variable intention treat basis . The primary efficacy analysis compare mean peak lactate level day 1 post-operatively RIPC group control group use student-t test . The purpose pilot study assess safety feasibility conduct study data ( except peak lactate level day 1 ) analyze descriptive method use statistical inferential purpose . Analysis do purpose sample size calculation future large RCT establish trend . All statistical test two-sided 0.05 level significance . Data analyze Stata ( version 10.0 , Statacorp , Texas ) . Data collection : All variable record paper case report form research nurse . Upon completion , data transfer anonymized computer database . In summary : plan study promising , easy , low cost simple method ( RIPC ) great therapeutic potential prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury infant congenital heart disease .</detailed_description>
