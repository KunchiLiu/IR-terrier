	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose radiosurgery boost follow chemoradiation treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer may may remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Radiosurgery send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy together radiosurgery may kill tumor cell allow doctor save part body cancer start</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoradiation Radiosurgery Boost Treating Patients With Locally Advance Pancreatic Cancer That May May Not Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) radiosurgery boost add hypofractionated chemoradiation patient borderline resectable unresectable pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect radiosurgery boost add hypofractionated chemoradiation surgical morbidity ( specifically , heal surgical anastomosis abdominal wound late hemorrhage blood vessel field ) patient advanced borderline resectable ( BLR ) unresectable pancreatic cancer . II . To evaluate utility diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) assessment treatment response chemoradiation follow radiosurgery . III . To determine feasibility collect tissue immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis via endoscopic ultrasound compute tomography ( CT ) -guided fine needle aspiration . IV . To utilize pathologic response rate dose escalated region , hypofractionated region , dose gradient region well characterize radiobiologic response pancreatic cancer radiation dose escalation . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study radiosurgery . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute weekly undergo hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 5 day week week 1-3 . Patients undergo single fraction radiosurgery boost week 5 receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute weekly week 6-8 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
