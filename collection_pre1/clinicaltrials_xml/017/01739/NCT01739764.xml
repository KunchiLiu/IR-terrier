	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , non-randomized study provide continue access vemurafenib eligible participant BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignancy , previously enrol treated antecedent vemurafenib protocol meet protocol 's criterion disease progression , treat beyond progression still derive clinical benefit ( assessed investigator ) , may therefore potentially benefit continued treatment vemurafenib . Participants receive treatment oral vemurafenib 960 milligram ( mg ) twice daily ( BID ) , 720 mg BID , 480 mg BID , depend last dose antecedent protocol . Treatment continue progression disease long participant derive clinical benefit , judge investigator ( case-by-case decision approval Medical Monitor ) , death , withdrawal consent , unacceptable toxicity , loss follow-up , decision Sponsor terminate study , whichever occur first .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>BRAF V600 mutationpositive malignancy Prior eligibility study treatment antecedent vemurafenib protocol Ability begin treatment extension ( rollover ) protocol within 15 day follow last day study antecedent protocol Female participant childbearing potential male participant partner childbearing potential must agree use 2 adequate method contraception define protocol course study least 6 month completion study treatment Adverse event require discontinuation vemurafenib antecedent protocol Progressive disease antecedent protocol . If approval treat beyond progression already give antecedent protocol , participant may roll current protocol without sponsor approval . Under special circumstance , enrollment protocol dose beyond progression may consider require approval sponsor Participants meet follow exclusion criterion antecedent study time participant consider extension ( rollover ) study : Current , recent ( within 28 day prior Day 1 ) , plan use antitumor therapy outside study Any serious concomitant medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise safety participant compromise participant 's ability participate study History malabsorption clinically significant metabolic dysfunction History clinically significant cardiac pulmonary dysfunction specify antecedent study</criteria>
