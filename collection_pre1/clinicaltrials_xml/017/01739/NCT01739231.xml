	<brief_summary>This research study experimental ( investigational ) oral ETEC vaccine ( ACE527 ) . ACE527 live attenuate vaccine make prevent disease enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) , cause watery diarrhea , largely child live develop country traveler country . This research study also test investigational adjuvant call dmLT . An adjuvant something added vaccine make work well . The purpose study two-fold . First , Part A aim find vaccine vaccine combine adjuvant safe , tolerable , initiate immune response . Second , Part B aim find vaccine vaccine combine teh adjuvant prevents diarrheal disease challenge ETEC H10407 . About 60 healthy adult , age 18-50 , participate Part A , require stay research facility several night first dose , require stay overnight second third dos . Participants assign receive either vaccine alone , vaccine adjuvant , placebo mouth . Study procedures include : stool sample , blood sample , documentation side effect . Participants involve study related procedure 8 month . Interested volunteer Part A along volunteer never vaccinate Part A return participate Part B . These volunteer require stay overnight research facility several night challenge , treat antibiotic send home . Study procedure include stool sample , blood sample , documentation infection ETEC H10407 . If vaccine with/without adjuvant effective , volunteer development diarrhea , vaccine with/without adjuvant effective , volunteer diarrhea day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Immunogenicity Efficacy Study Live Attenuated ETEC Vaccine ACE527 With Without dmLT Adjuvant Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single site , Phase 1/2b , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , clinical trial healthy adult volunteer evaluate safety , immunogenicity efficacy live attenuate ETEC vaccine , ACE527 , without mucosal adjuvant , dmLT . ACE527 comprise three genetically attenuate engineered strain E. coli , antigen profile cover wide range ETEC surface colonization factor antigen ( CFA/I , CFA/II [ CS1 , CS2 , CS3 ] CFA/IV [ CS5 , CS6 ] ) also express LT-B , inactive subunit LT ( ETEC heat labile toxin ) . LT ( R192G/L211A ) , dmLT , derivative wild-type enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin genetically modify replace arginine amino acid position 192 glycine leucine amino acid position 211 alanine . Approximately 36 volunteer ( project enrollment plus possible alternate ) enrol Part A two separate Cohorts . Approximately 30 volunteer per Cohort randomize receive 10^10 cfu total live dose ACE527 vaccine alone , 10^10 cfu total live dose ACE527 vaccine + 25 µg dmLT , placebo . The placebo preparation CeraVacx , use buffer vaccine formulation . Cohort 1 2 volunteer receive 10^10 cfu total dose ACE527 , 10^10 cfu total dose ACE527 25 µg dmLT , placebo 0 , 1 , 2 month . Enrollment dose Cohort 2 dependent acceptable safety profile first dose Cohort 1 , base evaluation data Day 3 Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) . The first immunization Cohort administer Center Immunization Research ( CIR ) Inpatient Unit , follow 72 hour direct post-immunization observation . A Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) meet first dose cohort determine continuation volunteer dose outpatient basis , enrollment Cohort 2 . The SRC meet first dose Cohort 2 ; review SRC first dose appear safe well tolerate , subsequent dos administer outpatient basis . Safety assess solicited symptoms/subject memory aid laboratory evaluation . Adverse event ( AE ) grade accord standardize criterion . The immunogenicity outcome measure interest include serum IgG IgA antibodies ELISA vaccine antigen , cytokine assay , B T cell memory response , shed profile ACE527 , vaccine specific mucosal IgA responses Part B challenge cohort include least 14 24 volunteer per vaccine treatment group , recruit among participate Part A ; least 4 12 placebo recipient recruit among participate Part A ; plus additional unvaccinated control volunteer sufficient enroll total 60 recruit , need . Volunteers Phase 2b study enrol challenge 2-4 cohort due CIR Inpatient Unit capacity 30 bed . A minimum 8-10 control challenge cohort vaccinee ensure comparability attack rate across challenge cohort . Volunteers admit inpatient challenge , approximately 2 x 10^7 cfu fully virulent ETEC strain , H10407 , follow 5 day direct observation . A Data Review Committee ( DRC ) convene review clinical data challenge volunteer verify outcome per protocol definition vaccine efficacy assessment make . This study design initially single site , Phase 1 , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , clinical trial healthy adult volunteer evaluate safety immunogenicity live attenuate ETEC vaccine , ACE527 , without mucosal adjuvant , dmLT . The addition challenge step provide unique opportunity evaluate efficacy new lyophilize formulation ACE527 vaccine , give two three dose regimen , without dmLT , wild type ETEC strain H10407 challenge ( designate Part B : Phase 2b Open Label Challenge Study ) . In addition , challenge volunteer may allow identification immune correlate protection , take advantage newly available technology ( immune proteomics , transcriptomics , etc . ) This first man study explore immunogenicity efficacy lyophilize ACE527 alone combination dmLT . The primary objective study evaluate safety , reactogenicity tolerability , immunogenicity lyophilize , oral , live attenuate , ETEC vaccine designate ACE527 administer orally without double mutant heat labile toxin ( dmLT ) Days 0 , 28 , 56 ; evaluate vaccine efficacy 4-6 month later ETEC H10407 . The secondary objective examine shed ACE527 week follow vaccination , ass whether dmLT enhances immunogenicity ACE527 vaccine , measure protective efficacy 2 3 dos vaccine vaccine plus adjuvant severe diarrhea result challenge ETEC strain H10407 .</detailed_description>
