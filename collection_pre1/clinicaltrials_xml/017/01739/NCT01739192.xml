	<brief_title>A Novel Anti-Obesity Drug Combination Pharmacotherapy Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine ( COC ) dependence significant public health concern . A widely effective pharmacotherapy yet identify COC dependence . Innovative strategy need identify effective pharmacotherapy COC dependence . Testing medication effective disorder share neurobiological substrate drug dependence , example , could yield treatment manage COC dependence . Obesity also significant public health concern . Although obesity COC dependence typically consider distinct clinical entity , disease involve perturbation central biogenic amine and/or hypothalamic-melanocortin system . The obesity epidemic spur development medication promote weight loss . A combination bupropion ( BUP ) naltrexone ( NTX ) effective obesity . The overarch goal application demonstrate initial efficacy , safety , tolerability BUP-NTX combination COC dependence . A mixed-model experiment conduct separate cohort non-treatment-seeking , COC-dependent participant randomize different maintenance dos NTX ( i.e. , NTX between-subject factor ) . Participants ( N=12 ) NTX cohort maintain concurrently BUP ( i.e. , BUP within-subject factor ) . The reinforce effect intranasal COC determine participant NTX cohort maintain 4-7 day BUP dos ( i.e. , COC within-subject factor ) . COC ( 0 , 40 80 mg ) test multiple dose combination BUP ( 0 , 100 , 200 , 400 mg/day ) NTX ( 0 , 25 , 50 mg/day ) . The propose study also identify optimal dose combination BUP NTX effectively attenuate reinforce effect COC . This research provide critical information regard initial efficacy optimal dos novel drug combination , BUP NTX , COC dependence , enhance probability success advance clinical trial . Innovations propose research include : 1 ) test combination market drug demonstrate modest efficacy test mono-therapies ; 2 ) use sophisticated drug self-administration procedure ; 3 ) provide impetus conduct Phase II clinical trial demonstrate efficacy BUP-NTX combination COC dependence ; 4 ) demonstrate initial efficacy optimal dos combination commercially available drug , oppose wait novel molecule available test human , thereby impact clinical research practice quickly . In way , propose project shift current clinical research paradigm pharmacotherapy development significant impact treatment COC dependence .</detailed_description>
