	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether novel non-invasive method estimate coronary blood flow ( FFRct ) applicable evaluate functional significance coronary stenosis non-culprit vessel population patient recent STEMI ( ST-elevation myocardial infarction ) multivessel disease . The diagnostic performance reproducibility FFRct well qualitative quantitative correlation FFRct regional coronary blood flow examine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography ( cCTA ) non-invasive imaging modality provide high-resolution image coronary lesion . cCTA show good diagnostic performance detect exclude coronary artery stenosis , severity lesion often overestimate . With invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) hemodynamic consequence obstructive lesion estimate use Fractional Flow Reserve measurement ( FFR ) . There good correlation FFR non-invasive ischemia test stress echocardiography , exercise tolerance test Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) . Measurement FFR ICA represent `` gold standard '' assessment hemodynamic significance coronary artery lesion . The major disadvantage FFR invasive measurement , consequently risk complication . Recently non-invasive method determine FFR develop ( FFRct ) . FFRct perform use standard cCTA image , base computational fluid dynamic . The hemodynamic consequence stenotic lesion determine rest simulate condition hyperemia . Acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) divide STEMI NSTEMI basis ECG change . In Denmark patient STEMI treat primary percutaneous intervention ( PPCI ) culprit lesion . Any non-culprit lesion typically assess FFR 3-4 week . Even though rate complication ICA FFR low , complication severe . Also procedure quite resource demanding . Thus would desirable patient could non-invasively evaluated whether revascularisation indicate .</detailed_description>
