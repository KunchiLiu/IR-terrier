	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate long term outcome patient receive hypothermia treatment spinal cord injury . At institution , intravascular hypothermia use certain patient spinal cord injury past two year . This study collect data vital sign examination patient hospital also follow outpatient discharge go rehabilitation center . This data analyze compare historically publish data previous study . The aim investigation determine intravascular hypothermia result beneficial outcome patient spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothermia Following Acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It standard practice institution patient complete acute spinal cord injury receive hypothermia . Incomplete injury may also treat hypothermia . This prospective analysis data collect institution patient acute spinal cord injury receive hypothermia protocol . The care patient affect research . Data normothermia ( 37 degree Celsius ) obtain historical study analyze similar patient group . Patients arrive emergency department baseline neurological examination timely fashion prior induction hypothermia neurosurgical attend resident . All patient Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) injure spinal cord admission . Patients intubate medically sedate prior initial exam neurosurgical team exclude exam time may inaccurate . Patients receive hypothermia transfer Neurosurgical ICU , intubate sedate use muscle relaxant . Additional form sedation include benzodiazepine dexmedetomidine routinely use adjunct curtail shiver response . For patient receive hypothermia , Alsius CoolGardÂ® Icy Catheter place IVC via femoral vein temperature cool target ( 33 degree ) maximum rate ( 0.5 degrees/hr ) . Mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) keep &gt; 90 mm Hg time fluid bolus ( Normal Saline Albumin 5 % ) blood transfusion keep hematocrit 30 . Hypothermia 33 degree maintain 48 hour . Blood culture perform daily ( peripheral site catheter ) Orogastric tube ( OGT ) Nasogastric tube ( NGT ) place patient . Nutrition provide per current nutritional supplementation protocol . Intravenous fluid consist Normal Saline time unless serum Na rise 160 . Serum electrolytes , coagulation study complete blood count perform daily . After 48 hour hypothermia , patient rewarmed 37 degree control rate 0.1 degree/hr . After reach 37 degree , intravenous catheter maintain 6 day total keep systemic temperature 37 degree . Surface cool technique occasionally utilized purpose maintain normothermia 6 day . The patient discharge rehabilitation stabilize . All patient reevaluate 6 week , 6 , 12 month use ASIA sensory motor scale Functional Independence Measures ( FIM ) . A follow-up MRI scan do one year .</detailed_description>
