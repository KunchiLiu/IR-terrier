	<detailed_description>Background Ventriculoperitoneal shunting ( VPS ) diversionary procedure patient hydrocephalus first described 1908 . After introduction silastic catheter 1970s method become treatment choice child adult communicate hydrocephalus . However , average patient VPS undergo 2.1 shunt revision every 3 year life , wide range revision first decade 21 revision within first year . For reason technical improvement impact positively revision rate surgical burden strongly need . In standard VPS procedure proximal part shunt first place one lateral ventricle . The distal part shunt tunnel subcutaneously head abdomen , 20-25 cm distal catheter tip introduce peritoneal cavity paraumbilical mini-laparotomy . The intraperitoneal placement distal catheter perform blindly , whereby tip catheter direct caudally direction pelvis order avoid kink potential strangulation catheter . In set functionality system estimate feel resistance out- inflow manually pump reservoir near valve cranial level . Distal shunt failure report occur 10-30 % case . Secondary dislocation peritoneal catheter subcutaneous tissue improper placement peritoneal cavity procedure contribute high shunt failure rate . Furthermore , blind catheter placement obese patient patient adhesion previous abdominal surgery challenge may lead injury intra-abdominal organ . In 1993 , Bassauri et al report laparoscopic placement peritoneal catheter VPS . Since several , small retrospective series show good result laparoscopic VPS , term efficacy safety , adults child . Two large series publish recently . Schubert et al . report prospective study 50 adult patient use laparoscopically assist peritoneal shunt insertion . A retrospective cohort 50 match patient serve control . They report intraoperative complication , long operation time laparoscopic group ( 59 versus 49 minute ) , 2 malfunction ( 4 % ) 1 infection laparoscopic group ( 2 % ) 6 malfunction ( 12 % ) 6 infection ( 12 % ) historic cohort , difference statistically significant favour laparoscopic group . In recent large series publish date , Bani et al . report experience 151 patient , peritoneal catheter implant use laparoscopic technique . They also use retrospective cohort 50 non-laparoscopy patient control . The operation time slightly longer use laparoscopic technique ( 35-130 versus 30-120 minute ) , infection rate 2 % group . They describe dislocation distal catheter abdominal wall malpositioning distal catheter laparoscopic group 4 case non-laparoscopy group ( 8 % ) . In summary , non-randomized trial suggest safety procedure . The laparoscopic technique offer least theoretically significant advantage standard technique . The laparoscopic introduction peritoneal catheter allow intra-abdominal inspection , lyses adhesion whenever necessary , confirmation catheter position , visual assessment cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow catheter tip procedure . Due minimal trauma abdominal wall laparoscopic access also potential reduce postoperative adhesion , wound complication overall postoperative morbidity . Despite theoretical advantage , however , comparative , randomize data lack ventriculoperitoneal shunting still perform minilaparotomy vast majority neurosurgical centre . The absence scientific evidence favour laparoscopic technique , lack train neurosurgeon laparoscopic technique potential prolongation operating time ( potentially high risk infection ) probably main reason explain shift laparoscopic technique yet take place . Also , theoretically , inflation peritoneal cavity laparoscopy could potentially generate acute hydrocephalus ( e.g . distal revision ) due elimination pressure gradient necessary obtain flow CSF peritoneal cavity . These potential limitation warrant , view , prospective , randomize , control trial compare standard ( minilaparotomy ) technique . The demonstration superiority laparoscopic technique prospective , randomize study potential change standard care patient hydrocephalus need shunting . Methods 120 patient schedule VPS surgery randomise laparoscopic open insertion peritoneal catheter . The primary endpoint rate overall shunt complication/failure 12 month . Secondary endpoint distal shunt failure rate 6 week , 6 month 12 month , overall complication/failure 6 week 6 month , duration surgery hospitalisation , morbidity .</detailed_description>
