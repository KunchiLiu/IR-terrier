	<brief_title>Phase III Study Evaluate Morning Testosterone Normalization Overweight Men With Secondary Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol ZA-302 randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled multi-center Phase 3 study evaluate normalization morning testosterone level overweight men acquire hypogonadotropic hypogonadism normal baseline sperm concentration . The study require 10 12 clinic visit ( 2 eye exam ) , approximately 4 5½ month duration . Subjects treat 12-18 week . At Visit 3 ( Week 6 ) subject achieve morning T value ≥300 ng/dL up-titrated 25 mg . Placebo subject may sham titrate . Up-titrated subject receive additional 6 week treatment ( 18 week total ) . A schedule procedures assessment displayed Section 4 . The study enroll 152 male subject , 114 randomize treatment Androxal 38 randomize placebo , 3:1 ratio . Subjects must use prior testosterone treatment within last 6 month . Eligible subject must 2 consecutive assessment morning T 300 ng/dL LH 9.4 mIU/mL . They provide 2 sperm sample baseline , least 2 day apart , another 2 12 week treatment , up-titrated subject provide additional 2 sample end treatment . After 12 week treatment ( V5 ) subject undergo serial T assessment determination Cavg . Safety assessment include collection adverse event , eye examination , physical examination clinical laboratory assessment .</detailed_description>
