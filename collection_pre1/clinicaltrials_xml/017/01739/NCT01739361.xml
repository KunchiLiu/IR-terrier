	<brief_summary>Cell-free hemoglobin measure plasma patient sickle cell anemia , hemodialysis , red blood cell transfusion , patient sepsis . Cell-free hemoglobin patient population associate poor outcome , include association increase risk death . Acetaminophen may protective effect patient population inhibit hemoprotein-mediated lipid peroxidation . The purpose present trial study effect acetaminophen lipid peroxidation adult severe sepsis detectable cell-free hemoglobin . The primary hypothesis systemic marker oxidative stress lipid peroxidation , measure F2-isoprostanes , significantly low patient severe sepsis detectable cell-free hemoglobin receive acetaminophen compare placebo . The secondary hypothesis patient severe sepsis detectable cell-free hemoglobin treat acetaminophen well clinical outcome , include decrease incidence acute kidney injury low rate hospital mortality , compare receive placebo .</brief_summary>
