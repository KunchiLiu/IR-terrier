	<brief_summary>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) common disable psychiatric disorder . Left untreated under-treated , become chronic condition associate significant distress , depression , aggression , family disruption , substance abuse . There also accumulate evidence combat-related PTSD associate increase risk morbidity mortality . For welfare return Veterans PTSD family , critical disorder promptly identify effectively treat . Considerable advance make assessment treatment PTSD recent year ; however , psychopharmacological treatment show largely ineffective Veterans PTSD . To address gap , proposal seek test innovative treatment approach PTSD - pharmacological manipulation body 's major stress system ( hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis ) mifepristone . At high dos mifepristone glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) antagonist peripheral central nervous system effect , make compound interest treatment stress related disorder . There abundant evidence enhance GR sensitivity Veterans PTSD think underlie symptoms PTSD associate disturbance mood cognition . Thus , blockade GR receptor mifepristone may target unique aspect PTSD lead clinically meaningful improvement symptom cognition . There preliminary evidence short-term mifepristone treatment sustain beneficial effect mood , cognition sleep disturbance neuropsychiatric condition ( major depression , bipolar disorder , primary insomnia ) . That sustain clinical neuropsychological effect mifepristone normalization basal HPA axis activity drug discontinuation disorder , lead view mifepristone 's action include recalibration dysregulated HPA axis . Accordingly , investigator propose study effect mifepristone Veterans chronic PTSD determine efficacious improve PTSD symptom associate clinical outcome . To good understand mechanism action mifepristone investigator propose assess effect mifepristone HPA axis activity relationship treatment outcome clinical response . To achieve objective , investigator propose conduct Phase IIa , multi-site , double-blind , placebo control trial mifepristone Veteran outpatients military-related PTSD VA 's Cooperative Clinical Trial Award program . The investigator propose enroll 90 unmedicated male Veterans military relate PTSD four VA site ( Salisbury , NC , Bronx , NY , Durham , NC , San Diego , CA ) . Eligible Veterans randomly assign parallel group treatment 600 mg/day mifepristone placebo one week follow three month . In initial trial investigator propose study effect mifepristone Veterans PTSD monotherapy , rather adjunctive treatment , order well detect signal one . The investigator also describe effect mifepristone several clinical parameter include PTSD symptomology , depression severity , sleep quality , functional impairment . Several measure neuroendocrine function also obtain explore relationship plasma cortisol adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) level clinical response time addition rescue medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Therapeutics Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) : A Randomized Clinical Trial Mifepristone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel approach treatment post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) Veterans urgently need . This proposal seek test innovative approach , one involve careful pharmacological manipulation body 's major stress system , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , use one dose FDA-approved drug , mifepristone ( 600 mg/day ) . The rationale treatment trial mifepristone PTSD base wealth knowledge available persistent alteration HPA axis PTSD interaction central autonomic nervous system immune system . The consistent HPA axis finding PTSD , take together , suggest increase sensitivity effect glucocorticoids presence increase central activation HPA axis . Among replicated neuroendocrine finding elevate level corticotropin-releasing factor ( CRF ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , exaggerate cortisol response emotional stressor , exaggerated suppression cortisol synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( DEX ) . The early study effect dexamethasone ( DEX ) use standard 1.0 mg dose , find PTSD , unlike major depression , associate high rate cortisol non-suppression trend lower cortisol level post-DEX PTSD . A low dose ( 0.5 mg ) employ test hypothesis enhance suppression cortisol DEX Vietnam Veterans PTSD , confirm . Since , exception , great suppression cortisol low-dose DEX find PTSD subject , compare unexposed and/or trauma-exposed control without PTSD , diverse sample , include sample person expose combat , natural disaster , domestic violence , Holocaust , childhood physical sexual abuse . Furthermore , extent cortisol suppression associate PTSD symptom severity . The finding great down-regulation lymphocyte GR post-DEX suggest dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) finding may attributable responsive glucocorticoid receptor . More recent study demonstrate increased suppression ACTH DEX confirm increase glucocorticoid responsivity level pituitary . The study effect DEX HPA axis activity suggest enhance negative feedback inhibition HPA axis PTSD . Such inhibition could help explain despite evidence central HPA axis activation exaggerate response cortisol stressor ACTH stimulation PTSD , 24-hour basal cortisol level typically elevate indeed even sometimes low . Mifepristone selective type II glucocorticoid receptor antagonist favorable safety profile . It bind site synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone block negative feedback control cortisol pituitary . Thus , mifepristone , directly antagonize glucocorticoid receptor , find sensitive PTSD several model , ideally suit use determine pathophysiological significance increase glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity PTSD whether attenuation therapeutic value . The investigator propose study clinical , neuropsychological , neuroendocrine effect short-term treatment one dose mifepristone ( 600 mg/day ) well-characterized sample Veterans PTSD determine treatment effective achieve clinical response PTSD , well improve clinical symptom quality life . Furthermore , pulse therapy mifepristone sustain effect , hold promise different approach pharmacological treatment , one may preferable Veterans want psychopharmacological treatment continuously long-term . Primary Objective 1 . To determine whether 600 mg mifepristone daily one week male Veterans chronic PTSD yield sufficiently high proportion clinical responder one month warrant extensive definitive research . Secondary Objectives 1 . To study trajectory Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) ( CAPS ) ( past week symptom status ) score study duration mifepristone placebo . 2 . To determine effect mifepristone compare placebo time addition rescue medication . 3 . To determine Phase III study justify . 4 . To compare adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) two group . This Phase IIa clinical trial seek enroll 90 eligible male combat Veterans chronic PTSD . Participants randomly assign treatment 600 mg/day mifepristone placebo one week assess clinical outcome one three month follow-up . Eligibility base inclusion exclusion criterion enumerate Human Participants section . The investigator plan include male combat Veterans chronic PTSD receive psychotropic medication . The inclusion exclusion criterion select order include representative sample possible also address safety concern . Veterans actively suicidal assessed Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) attempt suicide within past two year exclude . ( If suicidality identify , necessary step take ensure appropriate clinical care provide , local suicide prevention policy implement . ) Veterans adrenal insufficiency exclude , Veterans major medical neurological illness , may increase risk develop adverse event . Veterans renal disease/impairment , hepatic disease/impairment , cardiac illness ( e.g . coronary vascular disease , congestive heart failure ) , hypokalemia screening also exclude . Since mifepristone use prolong correct QT ( QTc ) interval dose-related manner , Veterans prolong QTc interval , define &gt; 450 msec , ECG screen exclude . To evaluate QTc prolongation post-mifepristone treatment , ECG also perform 3 day follow visit ( visit 1.5 ) 1 week follow-up visit ( week 1 , visit 2 ) . Participants potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( fluconazole , ketoconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , rifampin ) anticonvulsant ( e.g. , phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine ) exclude since medication impact metabolism mifepristone ( see Risk/Benefit Assessment detail ) . Due increase risk adverse drug reaction , Veterans take simvastatin , lovastatin , fentanyl , pimozide , bupropion , nefazodone , dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , quinidine , sirolimus , carvedilol , propanolol , diltiazem , verapamil tacrolimus also exclude . Since impact mifepristone male reproductive system extensively study , Veterans willing use effective mean birth control 90 day mifepristone ingestion eligible ; cover critical period fetal development . Psychotropic medication use exclusionary study entry ; Veterans previously treat stable regimen may enrol minimum five half-lives elapse since Veteran last take psychotropic medication . ( Sleep aid trazodone ( 50 mg/day ) zolpidem ( 10 mg/day ) may offer Veterans insomnia as-needed basis onset study . ) Major depression anxiety disorder exclusionary since frequently co-occur PTSD remain unclear whether presence represent true comorbidity , symptom overlap , severe illness . Since mild head trauma common military population general , exclude participant would diminish generalizability sample ; participant severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , define extended period unconsciousness amnesia follow injury , exclude . The Ohio State University ( OSU ) TBI Identification Method use assess lifetime history TBI . This method first establish significant injury one 's life determines TBI may occur base whether participant experience loss consciousness ( LOC ) , , long . A person say mild TBI LOC exceed 30 minute injury , moderate TBI LOC 30 minute 24 hour , severe TBI LOC exceed 24 hour . The OSU TBI assessment administer trained rater psychiatric evaluation conduct screening . Additionally , Veterans diagnose alcohol/substance abuse dependence exclude recently engage maladaptive pattern use abuse . More specifically , person meet diagnostic criterion alcohol/substance dependence exclude manifest dependence within previous three month ( i.e. , meet three seven criterion maladaptive pattern use last three month ) . Persons alcohol/substance abuse ( , definition , meet criterion alcohol dependence ) exclude show maladaptive pattern alcohol use past one month ( i.e. , meet one four criterion maladaptive pattern abuse ) . Veterans currently receive psychotherapy - individually group set - consider significant benefit PTSD , accord VA Department Defense ( DoD 's ) Treatment Guidelines , also exclude . These therapy cognitive therapy PTSD ( e.g . cognitive processing therapy ( CPT ) ) , exposure therapy ( e.g. , prolonged exposure therapy ) , stress inoculation training , eye movement desensitization reprocessing ( EMDR ) . Other form therapy case management specifically target PTSD symptom and/or show provide significant benefit PTSD allow entry throughout study ( e.g . supportive therapy , psychodynamic therapy , anger management , cognitive behavioral therapy symptom problem PTSD ) . The investigator recognize military-related PTSD woman increasingly common effective treatment need group well . However , woman exclude initial trial safety reason , since mifepristone abortifacient . Should mifepristone prove effective male Veterans PTSD , would provide rationale future study woman , employ additional safeguard .</detailed_description>
