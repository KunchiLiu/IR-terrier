	<brief_summary>The purpose study describe gastrointestinal ( GI ) motility patient suffer severe Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) compare result similar result study healthy subject . Both study do use Motilis 3D-Transit system consist small electronic capsule ingest detect receiver carry patient . Position orientation capsule interpret dedicate computer software transit time , progression velocity contraction frequency reveal . The study mainly descriptive design test evaluate usefulness Motilis 3D Transit system UC patient tell u GI motility severe inflammation . Motilis 3D-Transit system give u unique chance study gastrointestinal canal whole severe illness . We expect include 20 patient suffer severe UC admit Hospital purpose get medical treatment . We expect drop , case drop new patient include .</brief_summary>
