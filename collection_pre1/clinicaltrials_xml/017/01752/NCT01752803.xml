	<brief_summary>Background : The connection gut health diabetes status increasingly recognize . Gut microbiota composition diabetic differs non-diabetic individual . Interestingly , level glucose tolerance associate specific microbiota rarely find healthy individual . Probiotics one functional food believe mediate health promote activity modulate composition gut health . Ingestion probiotic show influence gut microbiota composition also secretion gut hormone insulin resistance animal model limit trial human . Supplementation probiotic also show affect glucose homeostasis , improve diabetes related comorbidities obesity , hypertension , hyperlipidemia . Objectives hypothesis : To address research gap , Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) propose determine efficacy probiotic supplementation adjuvant therapy improve glucose homeostasis modulate gut microbiota composition gut hormone secretion individual type 2 diabetes . We hypothesize probiotic supplementation improve blood glucose control well diabetes related co-morbidities individual type 2 diabetes . Methodology : This double blind randomize parallel group control trial 3 month probiotic supplementation placebo . After screen eligible subject select . Then , consent taking , subject randomly assign either receive probiotic supplement 3 month . Measurements blood parameter include glycemic control related parameter , lipid profile , renal profile , liver function test well three day diet recall , anthropometry measurement take place baseline , 6 week 12 month . Expected Outcomes : Probiotic supplementation adjuvant therapy would improve glucose homeostasis gut health compare placebo eventually beneficially affect diabetes related condition . This study would provide avenue identify possibility probiotic supplementation adjuvant therapy management type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
