	<brief_summary>Auditory motor-coupling show induce neural-entrainment synchronize walking-pace sonic tempo . The extent acoustical-motor entrainment induce longer-term change physical activity behaviour remain unclear . Cardiac rehabilitation essential associate irrefutable mortality benefit patient follow acute cardiac event . Randomized clinical trial demonstrate 25-50 % improvement survival compare control ; however , many 50 % patient dropout program prior completion , undermines morbidity mortality benefit ( 37 ; 54 ) . Research explore way improve compliance program suggest incorporation music holistic , patient-centered intervention rehabilitation/exercise program associate improved motivation , endurance satisfaction amongst cardiac rehabilitation participant . The MAINTAIN study design conduct feasibility evaluation effect preference-based music intervention adherence cardiac rehabilitation program Toronto Rehabilitation Institute . The primary objective trial evaluate feasibility implementation protocol within context program . This two-arm , block 2:1 randomize trial . 35 patient participate cardiac rehabilitation Toronto Rehabilitation : Cardiac Rehabilitation Secondary Prevention Program recruit participant randomize : 1 ) control ( standard , usual care ) ; , 2 ) music intervention . The randomization process employ block 2:1 strategy , whereby subject randomize music treatment arm 2:1 . All patient randomize arm 2 equally randomize either ( 2 ) preference-based music intervention , ( 3 ) preference-based music enhance RAS . The primary outcome measure weekly physical activity 3 month duration measure use tri-axial accelerometer . We also analyze impact preference-based music intervention base audio playlist utilization , self-reported sit time , exercise-times , on-site attendance cardiac rehabilitation program ( attendance ) , peak oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) ( stress-test ) , self-efficacy level ( self-efficacy questionnaire ) . These measure collect analyze throughout course intervention ( 3 month ) .</brief_summary>
