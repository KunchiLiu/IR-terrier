	<brief_summary>A significant proportion people schizophrenia characterize impaired ability socially engage others , may reflect social aversion secondary defeatist belief ; decrease motivation social interaction ; and/or impairment normal reinforcement value social interaction . These impairment social function show associate social skill deficit ; decrease ability identify remember emotional facial expression empathize emotional status others . Unfortunately , pharmacological intervention limit benefit impair social function , whereas psychosocial intervention provide partial benefit critical aspect illness . The development effective intervention functional outcome remain central therapeutic challenge . Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training ( CBSST ) use corrective feedback reinforcement provide successful interaction challenge reduce defeatist performance belief contribute low drive interfere social functioning . CBSST show modest effect social function people schizophrenia . Oxytocin play critical role regulation normal social affiliative behavior ; hypothesize enhance social affiliation reduction anxiety social risk aversion ; enhancement motivation prosocial approach behavior ; and/or increase modulation salience process social cue . People schizophrenia decrease oxytocin level , associate impaired ability identify facial emotion decrease prosocial behavior . The study comprise three phase : 1 ) 2-week Evaluation Phase ; 2 ) 24-week Double-blind Treatment Phase ; 3 ) 3-month Follow-up Phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A NIMH mission priority development new good intervention , whose focus extend beyond symptom amelioration development intervention allow people suffer severe mental illness `` live full productive life '' ( NIMH Strategic Plan , 2008 ) . In particular , NIMH Strategic Plan note importance translate `` research biological cause disorder inform develop psychosocial biomedical intervention target core feature disease , assess outcomes appropriate course illness study , develop study design impact feature . '' The current proposal build upon observation : 1 ) people schizophrenia characterize marked impairment social function ; 2 ) current pharmacological treatment address impairment ; 3 ) CBSST show modest effect social function people schizophrenia . This limited efficacy may relate lack interest drive people schizophrenia social interaction ; 4 ) oxytocin play critical role normal social affiliative behavior ) reduction anxiety social risk aversion , b ) enhancement motivation prosocial approach affiliative behavior , and/or c ) increase modulation salience process social cue ; 5 ) decrease oxytocin associate social function impairment people schizophrenia . The propose study base proposition use pharmacological agent , whose behavioral effect compliment psychological mechanism action psychosocial intervention , important adaptation intervention previously show moderate effect social function . The addition oxytocin CBSST hypothesize : 1 ) enhance reduction defeatist performance belief reduce social risk aversiveness avoidance , would increase exposure reinforcement corrective feedback ; 2 ) enhance social skill acquisition improvement proximal social behavior , e.g . make eye contact attend facial expression social partner ; 3 ) facilitate translation learn social skill community practice effect prosocial attachment behavior , reduction social disinterest , effect distal behavior , e.g . initiate conversation respond social invitation . Increased social risk take within session would expose participant great frequency positive feedback success experience , would provide evidence dispute defeatist belief social disinterest attitude . In addition , increase social risk taking could improve homework adherence ( e.g. , practice talk people community ) engagement new community activity . These interactive effect would subsequently lead substantial improvement CBSST efficacy social function . Ultimately , importance improve social function effect improvement would overall level health functioning , include vocational outcome . The propose study enable u collect preliminary data acceptability , efficacy , feasibility , safety propose intervention . In particular , would first study examine safety long-term oxytocin population . The study also provide critical data feasibility recruit retain participant schizophrenia long-term intervention , combine two different therapeutic modality : CBSST oxytocin . If find efficacious , feasible , well-tolerated , plan conduct large study , would include use cognitive imaging biomarkers , fully elucidate mechanism action observe treatment effect . The investigator address follow specific aim : Aim # 1 ( Efficacy ) : To determine CBSST + oxytocin compare CBSST + placebo-oxytocin associate improve social function . Aim # 2 ( Safety ) : To determine CBSST + oxytocin compare CBSST + placebo-oxytocin associate increased incidence side effect . Aim # 3 ( Change Mechanism ) : To determine CBSST + oxytocin compare CBSST + placebo-oxytocin associate reduce social aversion , include social disinterest defeatist performance belief ; increase ability trust others ; and/or improved performance facial recognition memory measure . Aim # 4 ( Other Outcomes ) : To determine CBSST + oxytocin compare CBSST + placebo-oxytocin associate improved neuropsychological test performance , and/or decrease positive , negative , and/or anxiety/depression symptom , clinical global improvement .</detailed_description>
