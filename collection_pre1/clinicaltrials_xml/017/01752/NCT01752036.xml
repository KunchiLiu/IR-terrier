	<detailed_description>This phase II trial evaluate rate radiographic local recurrence follow post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost patient metastatic solid malignancy spine metastasis status post resection . Patients treat 600 cGy x 5 fraction tumor bed follow clinically radiographically determine local recurrence follow treatment well might expect conventional radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
