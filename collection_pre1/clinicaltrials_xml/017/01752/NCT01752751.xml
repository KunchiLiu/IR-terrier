	<brief_title>Predicting Tolerance Radiation Therapy Older Adults With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A comprehensive geriatric assessment tool develop Hurria colleague use non-radiation oncology clinical setting predict toxicity old patient cancer treatments.1 The investigator hypothesize tool ( refer throughout document CGA ) use radiation oncology clinic predict poor treatment tolerance . The primary objective study assess association pre-treatment functional status ( measure Independent Activities Daily Living ( I-ADL ) component CGA ) poor tolerance radiation therapy ( defined section 2.3.1 ) . Secondary objective include exploration association pre-treatment I-ADL status CGA occurrence acute grade 3-5 toxicity radiation therapy , decrease Quality Life ( QoL ) measure throughout radiation therapy assess EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire . The investigator also want compare rate physician report acute toxicity patient report acute toxicity older cancer patient population , assess association elevate p16Ink4α expression peripheral T lymphocytes poor tolerance acute grade 3-5 toxicity radiation therapy , explore association baseline component CGA poor tolerance acute grade 3-5 toxicity radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
