	<brief_summary>Kinesio tap novel method recently emerge viable option treat various musculoskeletal neuromuscular deficit . The application tape injure soft tissue joint provide support protection structure . Many different technique use injury prevention , treatment , rehabilitation , proprioception sport . Elastic adhesive tape may use unload Myofacial Trigger Points ( MTrPs ) , A trigger point locate fascia , ligament , muscle , tendon ; however , MTrPs also find skeletal muscle and/or fascia . An MTrP hyperirritable spot , associate taut band skeletal muscle painful compression stretch , give rise typical refer pain pattern well autonomic phenomenon . The use tape along muscle unload affect soft tissue seem effective treatment trigger point inhibit overactive muscle , change orientation fascia proprioceptive effect . The purpose study determine efficacy Kinesio tap application trigger point piriformis muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Piriformis syndrome peripheral neuritis sciatic nerve cause abnormal condition piriformis muscle . Some investigator consider form Myofacial pain syndrome define presence exquisite tenderness nodule palpable taut band muscle . Trigger point able produce refer pain , either spontaneously digital compression . Although myofascial trigger point widely recognize phenomenon clinical practice , remain much elucidate regard pathophysiology . Conservative pharmacotherapy nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , muscle relaxant , physical therapy modality heat therapy , cold therapy , ultrasound , electrical current stretch traditionally use treatment trigger point . The utilization Kinesio tap regard propose mechanism include 1 ) restore correct muscle function support weaken muscle , ( 2 ) reduce congestion improve flow blood lymphatic fluid , ( 3 ) decrease pain stimulate neurological system , ( 4 ) correcting misalign joint retrieve muscle spasm ( 5 ) enhance proprioception increase stimulation cutaneous mechanoreceptors helpful restore muscle function patient Myofacial trigger point . However , many control study analyze effect Kinesio tap treatment . Therefore , purpose study determine efficacy KT application easy appropriate method trigger point piriformis muscle .</detailed_description>
