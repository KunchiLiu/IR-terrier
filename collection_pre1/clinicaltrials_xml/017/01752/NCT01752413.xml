	<brief_title>Iron Depletion Replacement Blood Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study conduct IRB approval Memorial Blood Centers . Approximately 1000 donor enrol two-year period . Participant Recruitment Donors present donate whole blood MBC Hb value 12.5-13.5 ( male ) 12.0-13.0 ( female ) ask participate . Written inform consent obtain participant . STUDY PROCEDURES MBC responsible donor consenting , specimen collection testing , donor deferral , donor-follow-up , record keep . Before study participation , donor meet inclusion criterion require sign date inform consent . All participant receive study information sheet ask screening question donor information . An EDTA red top tube take diversion pouch participant donation , obtain sample already draw donor screening . The EDTA sample red top tube use determine baseline CBC ferritin level , respectively . Female participant Hb 12.0-12.4 allow donate per FDA regulation , ask EDTA red top tube drawn determine baseline CBC ferritin level , respectively . Participants whose ferritin level &lt; 30 ( male ) &lt; 20 ( female ) eligible enrollment low ferritin group . Those ferritin level &gt; 30 ( male ) &gt; 20 ( female ) enrol low Hb group . Females whose Hb range 12.0-12.4 ferritin level &gt; 20 follow . Once ferritin level determine , participant group contact study nurse . Those low Hb group notify result allow return standard 56 day deferral . Those low ferritin group offer iron replacement therapy defer blood donation 112 day . Oral Iron Replacement Therapy Participants low ferritin group offer 200 tablet Ferrous gluconate 325 mg ( 36 mg elemental iron ) send mail . Tablets child proof container . This amount form iron choose ready accessibility counter pack 100 low cost donor/donor center . Also , follow anemia website suggest 60mg elemental iron daily , i.e . 2-3 iron tablet divide dos daily.Participants instruct take one lunch one bedtime . Participants instruct contact study physician study nurse immediately adverse event occur . Between 25 35 day , study physician nurse contact participant low ferritin group ass compliance tolerance iron replacement therapy use standard instrument . Those unacceptable intolerance ferrous gluconate may offer carbonyl iron time , re-interviewed day 60 70 use instrument . Participant Follow-Up Participants group ask return donate deferral period . During follow-up donation , participant ask complete follow-up questionnaire , sample take determine CBC ferritin level . Participants notified result . Statistical analysis perform determine outcome measure .</detailed_description>
