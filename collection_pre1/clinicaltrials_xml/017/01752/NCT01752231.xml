	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) -magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diagnose cancer . New diagnostic procedure , DCE-MRI may help find diagnose cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization Novel DCE-MRI Imaging Sequences Cancer Therapy Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Optimize develop functional DCE-MRI pulse sequence , involve injection MRI-visible contrast agent , image head/neck , abdominal pelvic region . II . Determine ideal radiofrequency ( RF ) coil setup maximize signal noise ratio optimize pulse sequence . III . Distill find specific aim 1 2 streamlined protocol use subsequent study cancer phenotyping treatment monitor quantitative manner . IV . To establish virtual reference image repository future study . OUTLINE : Patients undergo DCE-MRI approximately 30-60 minute consist anatomical scout image localize region interest , set pre-injection scan calibrate dynamic image set , dynamic image set contrast agent inject , set post-injection scan calibrate DCE-MRI database .</detailed_description>
