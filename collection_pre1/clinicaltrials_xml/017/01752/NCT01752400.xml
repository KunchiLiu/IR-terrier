	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause drug effective treating type cancer . It also mean FDA yet approve drug type cancer use outside research study . It find people NSCLC change ( mutation ) certain gene call ALK gene . This mutated gene help cancer cell grow . There drug ( crizotinib ) approve FDA treatment people NSCLC mutation ALK gene . Most people respond crizotinib initially . Over time , however , patient may stop responding ( become resistant ) crizotinib additional change ALK gene make crizotinib ineffective . AUY922 investigational drug may stop cancer cell grow abnormally . This drug use research study . Information research study suggest AUY922 may effective kill cancer cell become resistant drug like crizotinib . Only participant change ALK gene allow participate study . The purpose study test safety AUY922 determine well AUY922 treat participant advance , ALK-positive NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree participate research study , ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test include medical history , physical exam , performance status , assessment tumor , EKG , echocardiogram multigated acquisition scan , eye exam , blood draw , blood pregnancy test , urine tset collection piece store tumor tissue . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Study treatment give 21 day cycle . AUY922 give IV ( vein ) . This call infusion . You receive infusion AUY922 jon day 1,8 15 cycle ( per week ) . The infusion take 60 minute . A schedule clinic visit study summarize . At every visit , tell study staff feel whether health change . may lab test do part care cancer addition list . Cycle 1 , Day 1 : physical examination , performance status , EKG , Blood draw routine urine test . Cycle 1 , Day 2 : EKG Cycle 1 , Day 3 : EKG Cycle 1 , Day 8 : measurement weight vital sign , performance status , EKG , question side effect may medications take Cycle 1 , Day 15 : physical exam , performance status , EKG , blood draw , question side effect may medications take . Note Cycle 1 need stay ( return ) clinic last EKG follow Day 1 AUY922 infusion , come clinic Days 2 3 EKGs Cycle 2 beyond , Day 1 : physical exam , performance status , EKG , blood draw , question side effect may medications take , routine urine test Cycle 2 beyond , Day 8 : measurement weight vital sign , performance status , EKG , question side effect medication Cycle 2 beyond , Day 15 : physical exam , vital sign , performance status , EKG , blood draw , question side effect medication Additional EKGs may do time study doctor think necessary . A blood test measure amount cardiac enzymes blood may do whenever abnormal finding heart rhythm change suspect see EKG . CT MRI scan do measure disease every 6 week . A blood pregnancy test , woman become pregnant , perform every 6 week point pregnancy suspect . A standard eye exam do Cycle 3 , Day 1 . Additional eye exams do experience eye-related symptom , change vision . Within 1 week last dose study drug AUY922 , ask return clinic End Treatment Visit . At visit follow do : physical examination , performance status , ECG , ECHO MUGA scan , blood draw , urine test , eye exam , question side effect may medications take . You ask return clinic 3 week End Treatment Visit ( 4 week last dose AUY922 ) follow-up side effect may still experience stop AUY922 . If decide stop study treatment reason progression disease , ask follow-up CT scan MRIs every 12 week continue monitor status cancer . If tumor get bad , need CT scan ( MRIs ) part study . If disease progress , would like contact telephone every 3 month check status . This do last participant stop study treatment , long allow u contact . Keeping touch check condition help u look long term effect research . You continue receive AUY922 long cancer progress experience unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
