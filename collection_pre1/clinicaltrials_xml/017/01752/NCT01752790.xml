	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) incurable debilitate disorder affect increase number child . The etiology remain elusive , genetically determine aberrant immune response microbiota appear responsible . TNFα play pivotal role cytokine cascade inflammatory process mediates multiple process central pathogenesis CD . The natural history pediatric CD characterize recurrent flare-up severely impair patient growth , pubertal development nutritional status . Epidemiological observation show course CD , despite conventional treatment , inevitably progress development severe complication surgery . Infliximab widely use biological agent moderate-to-severe pediatric CD . At present biologics use failure conventional drug ( step-up approach ) represent peak CD therapeutic pyramid . The early use biologics ( top-down approach ) demonstrate effective adult CD . The project aim evaluate top-down approach may achieve mucosal heal irreversible tissue damage present late CD thus alter natural course disease , compare conventional approach . The study also add information safety infliximab use first-line therapy may add data benefit cost reversal traditional therapeutic pyramid pediatric CD , guide clinician deciding , introduce early aggressive treatment daily practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Top-down Therapy Pediatric Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label , randomize , prospective , controlled trial evaluate efficacy safety infliximab ( IFX ) first line therapy child moderate-to-severe CD . The estimate duration study 36 month , include recruitment phase 12 month , treatment phase 12 month , compose induction phase 8 week maintain phase 40 week , follow-up phase 12 month . The study protocol define accordance Declaration Helsinki approve local ethical committee . Written inform consent obtain child 's parent ; child older 12 year sign statement assent . Children age 6 18 year active CD confirm recognize clinical , radiological , endoscopic histological criterion consider trial satisfy follow criterion : 1. diagnosis CD ; 2 . PCDAI &gt; 30 ; 3. duration disease less 1 year time diagnosis ( early CD ) . Exclusion criterion : prior treatment immunosuppressive agent ( azathiorpine/6-mercaptopurine [ AZA/6-MP ] , methotrexate , cyclosporine ) anti-TNFα , stenosing CD , pre-existing systemic disease , hepatic renal dysfunction , systemic infection , suspected pregnancy , history active past tuberculosis , contraindication corticosteroid ( CS ) therapy . Children receive CS within 4 week randomization also exclude . Patients receive 5-ASA eligible drug keep stable regimen 4 week begin study . Early CD arbitrarily define disease duration &lt; 1 yr time diagnosis . Eligible patient randomly allocate receive 8-week course IFX plus AZA ( top-down arm - TD ) CS plus AZA ( step-up arm - SU ) . Randomization group assignment generate use computer-generated randomization schedule independent statistician unaware patient 's clinical history . Patients randomize TD arm receive induction regimen three consecutive i.v . infusion IFX ( Remicade , 5 mg/kg ) week 0 , 2 , 6 plus AZA ( 2 mg/Kg per os/day ) . During maintain phase , patient receive subsequent infusion IFX ( 5 mg/kg every 8 week ) , start 8 week end induction phase ( week 14 ) . For intravenous infusion , IFX reconstitute accord instruction give package insert . Patients respond induction regimen week 8 receive treatment IFX . At 12 month AZA discontinue patient TD group continue IFX monotherapy end study . Patients randomize SU arm receive methylprednisolone ( 1 mg/Kg/day per o . 2 week taper 5 mg/week stop ) plus AZA ( 2 mg/Kg/die per os/day ) . During trial , drug allow , include immunosuppressive agent , biological agent , CS , budesonide . 5-ASA sulfasalazine allow , begin enrollment . Disease recurrence treat IFX TD group , repeat CS SU group . Clinical assessment perform PCDAI baseline , every 4 week start treatment induction , every 8 week maintain phase ( 48 week ) , every 12 week follow-up phase . The PCDAI ( Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ) multi-item score , base recall precede week 's symptom , laboratory parameter ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate , haematocrit albumin ) , physical examination score &lt; =10 indicate inactive disease , 10-30 mild disease , &gt; 30 moderate-to-severe disease . Clinical response treatment require 25-point decrease PCDAI score . Clinical remission define absence symptom related CD PCDAI &lt; =10 . From patient blood sample determine full blood count , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , serological value albumin , urea , iron , creatinine , electrolytes , pancreatic liver function test take start randomization , every 4 week induction phase , every 8 week maintain phase . All patient undergo ileo-colonoscopy , 8 week ( end induction phase ) 48 week ( end maintain phase ) begin treatment . Endoscopy perform pediatric endoscope deep sedation propofol ( induction dose : 1 2 mg/kg ; repeat dose : 0.5 1 mg/kg ) . Endoscopies perform experienced operator unaware patient 's clinical history , treatment program clinical bioumoral response therapy . During ileo-colonoscopy , least two biopsy sample take ileum colonic segment routine histological assessment . Biopsies stain haematoxylin eosin read experience gastrointestinal pathologist , unaware endoscopic feature clinical history . Mucosal heal evaluate CDEIS ( Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Index Severity ) . CDEIS base presence , level terminal ileum colon , deep superficial ulceration , extension ulcerate surface presence ulcerate nonulcerated stenosis . Histological evaluation do score system previously validate used ileal colonic histology , combine acute change ( infiltration mononuclear polymorphonuclear cell , erosion ulceration ) chronic change involve mucosal architecture . The final histological colonic score obtain mean score colonic segment .</detailed_description>
