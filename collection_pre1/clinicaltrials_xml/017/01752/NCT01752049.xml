	<brief_summary>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) hereditary vascular condition characterize development abnormal connection artery vein throughout body , call vascular malformation . These abnormal blood vessel refer arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) large telangiectasias small . Telangiectasias develop due irregular growth blood vessel . Anti-angiogenic therapy , drug Apo-Timop , curb growth new blood vessel . Apo-Timop include class medication call beta-blockers . Anti-angiogenic therapy exert beneficial effect number way : disabling agent activate promote cell growth , directly block grow blood vessel cell . The investigator think anti-angiogenic therapy may lead shrink telangiectasia people HHT . The investigator hope study provide u proof concept might lead development study anti-angiogenic therapy help improve life individual vascular malformation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This small study 10 patient St. Michael 's Hospital HHT least 5 typical telangiectasias . Patients anticipate major surgery study pregnant , breast feeding beta blocker medication may enroll study . This study last 12 week . During time , subject apply drop either Apo-timop 0.5 % placebo solution 4 telangiectasias twice daily . The active study medication call Apo-Timop clear liquid solution store bottle . An eye dropper use application . - Apo-timop applied 3 telangiectasias - placebo apply one telangiectasia A placebo inactive substance , active medication , look real medication . There potential harm receiving placebo . It necessary use placebo make sure effect Apo-timop determine without bias . Subjects receive four numbered bottle every 28 day period well photo indicate bottle applied telangiectasia . Neither subject research staff know telangiectasia receive placebo . Apo-timop , part standard therapeutic regimen HHT . It Health Canada approve medication apply eye drop , show reduce pressure eye commonly use glaucoma .</detailed_description>
