During last decade , common recommend exercise MS patient , recently prove beneficial effect patient . Resistance- endurance training constitute two extreme basic physical exercise . To gain insight effect exercise therefore make sense understand extreme . In mild moderately impaired MS patient endurance training well tolerate provide beneficial effect . However , exercise modality yet test severely disabled patient , therefore unclear endurance training feasible beneficial patient . The investigator , therefore , design feasibility study evaluate effect 4 week endurance train severely disabled MS patient ( Expanded Disability Status Scale score &gt; 6 ) .
