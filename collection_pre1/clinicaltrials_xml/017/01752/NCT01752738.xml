	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease associate accumulation various metabolite , i.e. , uremic retention solute . Evidence mount colonic microbiome contributes substantially uremic retention solute . Indoxyl sulfate p-cresyl sulfate among extensively study gut microbial metabolite , associate cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease progression overall mortality . Mechanisms govern intestinal uptake metabolism , however , currently unknown . The investigator aim explore transport characteristic depth . Therefore , colonic biopsy sample patient chronic kidney disease , analyze compare available data healthy control . Insights mechanisms control intestinal transport metabolism indoxyl sulfate p-cresyl sulfate certainly relevant might lead novel therapeutic target treatment chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
