	<brief_title>Observational Study Conception/Pregnancy Adult Patients With CML Treated With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management patient chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) pregnancy matter continue debate . The introduction TKIs clinical practice dramatically change prognosis CML . Patients diagnose chronic phase reasonably expect many year excellent disease control good quality life . Thus , need address issue relate fertility pregnancy arisen . Physicians frequently ask advice regard need , appropriateness , stop treatment order conceive . The management fertility begin diagnosis . This mean immediate future treatment consider begin . Therefore , maintenance fertility take account since diagnosis . Imatinib genotoxic might lead decrease sperm count . Nevertheless , Imatinib teratogenic rat give organogenesis dose high 100 mg/kg , approximately equivalent 800 mg/day men . Until , approximately 60 pregnancy report partner men Imatinib . No suggestion problem conception , pregnancy , delivery increase congenital abnormality report . Regarding woman , 204 patient expose Imatinib , 180 report literature ( 76 , 77 ) . Of 180 woman expose imatinib pregnancy , outcome data available 125 ( 69 % ) . Of known outcome , 50 % deliver normal infant 28 % underwent elective termination , 3 follow identification abnormality . There total 12 infant abnormality identify , 3 strikingly similar complex malformation clearly cause concern . It appear although pregnancy expose imatinib likely successful outcome , remain risk exposure may result serious fetal malformation . Although number small disturbing cluster rare congenital malformation imatinib safely recommended , particularly period organogenesis . Last least , recently report poor outcome reintroduction Imatinib patient interrupt therapy pregnancy without achieve optimal response ( 78 ) , introduce another variable management woman pregnant receive Imatinib . Only data available use second generation TKIs , Nilotinib Dasatinib , pregnancy . Dasatinib mutagenic rat ( vitro vivo test ) , clastogenic CHO cell . It seem effect fertility male female rat . However , give skeletal alteration rat rabbit embryolethality rat administer pregnancy . Eleven pregnancy report dasatinib : 5 patient deliver normal infant , 3 elective termination 2 spontaneous abortion report . On hand , 9 male patient conceive dasatinib : 8 normal infant deliver , 1 case ongoing time report . Nilotinib mutagenic rat . It effect fertility male female rat . When administered pregnancy , evidence teratogenicity embryo foetotoxic rat rabbit . Only sporadic case patient pregnant/had conceive Nilotinib report , speculation make data . In summary , virtually data regard II generation TKIs , must discontinue woman wish become pregnant . Several question still remain unanswered regard management patient receive TKIs want conceive , expose TKI pregnancy/conception .</detailed_description>
