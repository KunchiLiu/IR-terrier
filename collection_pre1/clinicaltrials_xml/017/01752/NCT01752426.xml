	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn PCI-32765 ( ibrutinib ) may affect life cycle blood-cancer cell . Cancer cell `` label '' heavy water learn birth rate death rate . Ibrutinib type drug call kinase inhibitor . Kinases protein inside cell help cell live grow . The study drug design inhibit `` block '' activity type kinase help blood-cancer cell live grow . By block activity specific kinase , possible study drug may kill cancer cell stop grow . Heavy water ( 2H2O ) special type water design help researcher learn quickly cancer cell body reproduce .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heavy Water Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive heavy water drink 4 week . The vial heavy water ship home location . On Days 1-5 , drink heavy water 3 time day . You drink 1 dose morning , 1 dose afternoon , 1 dose evening . You take dos least 3 hour apart . If miss dose , take soon remember . Make sure wait least 3 hour dos . Starting Day 6 first study visit , drink heavy water 1 time day even . You may choose drink heavy water without food . You give study diary record dose . If miss dose , take soon remember . If vomit dose , need make . Just wait next regularly schedule dose make note diary . Heavy Water Study Visits : On Day 1 Weeks 2 4 , blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test heavy water test . These blood sample bank future research . The sample use research study keep DNA protein analysis complete . These Samples send collaborator Feinstein Institute Medical Research KineMed , Inc. , order conduct heavy water analysis . After Week 4 , stop drinking heavy water follow either clinic local doctor 6-12 week . Every 2 week time stop drinking heavy water start take ibrutinib , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw heavy water test . This measure fast cancer cell make new protein DNA . - You ask drug may take . Every 4 week time stop drinking heavy water start take ibrutinib , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Ibrutinib Administration : Beginning around Weeks 10-16 , start take ibrutinib . You take 3 capsule mouth 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water 1 time day . The dose take least 30 minute eat least 2 hour meal , time day . If miss vomit dose , make dose . Take next dose regularly schedule time sure write study diary . You take study drug 12 cycle . Each cycle 28 day . If doctor think best interest , may continue take study drug even 12 cycle . You also take allopurinol mouth 1 time day first 1-2 week take ibrutinib low risk side effect . Ibrutinib Study Visits : At every study visit , ask drug may take side effect may . On Days 1 3 Week 1 , end Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw heavy water test . At end Week 12 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw heavy water test . - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . At end Weeks 16 20 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At end Weeks 24 36 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You CT scan check status disease . - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . At end Week 48 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You CT scan check status disease . Length Study Drug Dosing : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-study visit . Follow-Up Visits : If continue take study drug past 12 cycle , come clinic follow-up visit every month . You continue follow-up visit long take study drug . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Whenever doctor think need , follow test procedure : - You may CT scan check status disease . - You may bone marrow aspiration check status disease . End-of-Study Visits : : After last dose study drug , 1 time next month , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask symptom may . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient mantle cell lymphoma . Its use study investigational . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
