	<brief_summary>The project undertake Qilu Hospital Shandong University 13 well-known hospital China . In order report efficacy safety Recombinant Human thrombopoietin combine Dexamethasone treatment adult primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) , compare High-dose Dexamethasone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rhTPO Combining Dexamethasone Versus High-dose Dexamethasone Initial Treatment ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , multicentre , randomise control trial 200 primary ITP adult patient 14 medical center China . One part participant randomly select receive recombinant human thrombopoietin ( give subcutaneously dose 300Units/kg for7-14 consecutive day , follow flexible dosage depend platelet count 28th day ) , combine dexamethasone ( give intravenously dose 40 mg per day 4days , others select receive high-dose dexamethasone treatment ( give intravenously dose 40 mg daily 4 day ) . Platelet count evaluate treatment , order report conversion ratio primary ITP chronic ITP .</detailed_description>
