	<brief_summary>This early phase research study look whether experimental gene transfer , LVsh5/C46 ( also know Cal-1 ) , safe protect immune system effect HIV without use antiretroviral drug . Cal-1 experimental gene transfer agent design inhibit HIV infection 2 active part : 1 . Removing protein name CCR5 bone marrow white blood cell 2 . Producing protein name C46 bone marrow white blood cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Dual Anti-HIV Gene Transfer Construct Treat HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 33 million individual currently infect HIV . HIV/AIDS disease impairs immune function , primarily decrease CD4+ T lymphocytes . The progression contain daily dose antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) side effect treatment limiting , development HIV drug resistance force physician modify ART regimen . There effective vaccine currently available HIV . LVsh5/C46 ( also know Cal-1 ) dual therapeutic , self-inactivating lentiviral vector encodes short hairpin RNA HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 ( sh5 ) HIV-1 fusion inhibitor , C46 inhibit two process require HIV-1 infection : 1 . Binding virus cellular CCR5 co-receptor 2 . Fusion virus host cell The rationale Cal-1 introduce hematopoietic progenitor/stem cell ( HSPC ) mature CD4+ T lymphocytes protect cell progeny cell HIV-1 infection pathogenic sequela . This may provide continuous mean control HIV-1 single infrequent dose ( ) , thereby decrease delay ( partially completely ) need antiretroviral drug therapy .</detailed_description>
