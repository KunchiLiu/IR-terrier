	<brief_title>DC Vaccination Postremission Therapy AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ≥ 18 year either gender AML non-favorable risk profile CR CRi eligible allogeneic stem cell transplantation receive intradermal injection two different site ten immunotherapy autologous DCs present two leukemia-associated antigen one CMV antigen conserve cryomedium time span 26 week . Phase I test safety toxicity small group patient ( n=6 ) . After least four vaccination three patient , safety toxicity data present Data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) . Only DSMB objectives continuation trial , patient include trial . Again , three patient , receive minimum four vaccine , clinical data present DSMB , phase I terminate . The decision continuation trial do DSMB . If objective DSMB , trial continue evaluation start large group patient ( n=14 ) . During phase II trial , safety toxicity evaluate large co-hort patient ) . Besides , preliminary assessment efficacy perform include induction immunological response leukemia associate antigens well viral antigen ( CMV ) , MRD control , time progression disease ECOG performance status .</detailed_description>
