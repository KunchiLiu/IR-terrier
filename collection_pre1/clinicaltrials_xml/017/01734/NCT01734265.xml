Asthmatic patient must stable within 3 month prior Visit 1 stable inhale steroid dose within 6 week prior visit 1 throughout study . FEV1 must ≥ 80 % predict value . The IgEmediated sensitization must demonstrate following : medical history AND IgE specific CAP RAST ≥ 2 suspect relevant pollen ( grass pollen AND Olea and/or Parietaria ) AND positive skin prick test grass Olea and/or Parietaria .
