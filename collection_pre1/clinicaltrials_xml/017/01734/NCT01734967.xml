	<brief_title>Needle-based Confocal Endomicroscopy Examination Pancreatic Masse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Pancreatic cancer one aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy mortality rate follow closely incidence rate . The incidence increase prognosis grim especially late diagnosis metastatic potential . While surgical treatment currently potential curative intervention , 80-85 % PC case unfortunately detect late unresectable stage disease . In spite advance diagnosis management pancreatic cancer le 5 % patient alive five year . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) represent highly valuable tool management pancreatic cancer patient . As minimally invasive technique enable high-resolution image pancreatic parenchyma surround structure consider method choice detection clinically suspect pancreatic tumor , negative predictive value close 100 % . Its diagnostic sensitivity show previous study superior compare image technique , especially case small tumor . Additionally EUS enables guide fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) currently recommend firs-line procedure whenever pathological diagnosis require . However , EUS-FNA sampling technique drawback , mainly represent relatively low negative predictive value diagnose pancreatic cancer . It thus reliably rule diagnosis malignancy patient high clinical suspicion usually need repeat FNA . Confocal laser endomicroscopy emerge recent year novel technique actually enable vivo microscopic analysis ongoing endoscopy . Endomicroscopy perform either dedicate ( eCLE ) miniprobe-based system ( pCLE ) . It contrast base technique , widely use agent intravenously administer fluorescein . The probe-based endomicroscopy system consist flexible catheter probe represent bundle optical fiber link micro-objective , laser scan unit control acquisition software ( Cellvizio ; Mauna Kea Technology , Paris , France ) . The flexible confocal miniprobes specifically design pass work channel standard endoscope , biliary catheter cholangioscopes thus pCLE system easily integrate endoscopy unit . The principle technique base laser beam define wavelength focus towards target tissue recapture signal displayed 'optical biopsy ' single horizontal plane . The potential role CLE explore pathology upper low gastrointestinal tract , show good accuracy predict final histopathological diagnosis base immediate evaluation tissue vascular pattern . Recently CLE go beyond superficial luminal indication development new microprobe , i.e . flexible probe thin enough pass 19-gauge needle . Thus EUS guidance solid organ access real-time microscopic information . nCLE image abdominal organ far achieve animal model . The feasibility technique also prove clinical study descriptive criterion diagnosis pancreatic cystic neoplasm develop multicentre trial . However , limited number case pancreatic solid mass describe nCLE . Aim The aim propose study describe confocal imaging criterion pancreatic mass , lymph node liver metastasis identify EUS procedure perform pancreatic cancer stag ( EUS-nCLE ) , evaluate also feasibility safety nCLE examination . The hypothesis EUS-nCLE could allow target tissue sample pancreatic lesion result accurate diagnosis . With validation technique real-time pathological diagnosis could obtain immediate initiation adequate therapy single investigation . Patients The study prospectively include patient refer department EUS EUS-FNA suspect pancreatic mass 12 month period . The indication investigation base patient 's clinical history previous image study ( abdominal ultrasound , CT scan , MRI ) . Patients select accord follow criterion use throughout study : Data collect participant include : - Personal data ( name , surname , age , sex ) - EUS variable ( tumor characteristic ) - Histological immunohistochemical finding ( final diagnosis ) Imaging test All patient suspicion ( clinical , US , CT/MRI ) pancreatic mass evaluate EUS , nCLE EUS-FNA pathological diagnosis . For EUS examination linear instrument use perform complete examination pancreas . Tumor characteristic ( echogenicity , echostructure , size , vascular invasion ) described . The presence regional lymph node report maximal size , echogenicity , shape margin . Identification liver metastasis also look upon . EUS-nCLE perform EUS identification pancreatic tumor / lymph node / liver metastasis : The confocal microprobe preloaded 19G FNA needle previously describe advanced lesion EUS guidance . nCLE examination follow intravenous administration contrast agent ( 2.5 ml fluorescein 10 % ) . Image data store digitally offline analysis . EUS-FNA also perform image acquisition cytology smear cell block enable final pathological diagnosis Confocal image analyze examination principal investigator , clinical procedural information mind . In second step offline analysis , correlation representative confocal image classical hematoxylin eosin section identify . Final diagnosis The final diagnosis base EUS-FNA cytology and/or histological specimen patient refer surgery . Pathology sample obtain duodeno-pancreatectomies caudal pancreatectomy do curative intent , well microhistological fragment obtain EUS-FNA biopsy process paraffin embed usual staining ( haematoxylin-eosin ) , subsequent immune-histochemistry necessary . For patient without positive cytology histology diagnosis base EUS tumor characteristic relevant information ( clinical , image test ) follow-up least six month .</detailed_description>
