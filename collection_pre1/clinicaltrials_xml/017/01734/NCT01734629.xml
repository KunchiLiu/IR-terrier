	<brief_summary>Several study show association chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Besides risk factor smoke , associate physical inactivity , advanced age systemic inflammation The use coronary compute tomography ( CCT ) multiple detector diagnostic method coronary disease , describe anatomy severity arterial obstruction . One way estimate cardiovascular risk coronary calcium score ( CCS ) . Due association COPD CAD , likely many patient IHD diagnose CT reduce lung function . The aim observational study establish correlation CCS lung function . It also correlate presence irreversible airway obstruction significant coronary lesion . Patients 40 year refer CCT agree participate study perform spirometry bronchodilator collect blood sample measure serum marker inflammation cardiovascular risk ( glycemia , lipid profile , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-Alpha ) fibrinogen ) . The data compare general population subgroup : smoker , former smoker nonsmoker . One year CCT patient contact investigator access emergency room visit , hospital admission fatal nonfatal coronary respiratory event . The investigator hypothesis reduce lung function independently associate elevated CCS , also risk factor increase hospital admission coronary event . The concomitant assessment lung function CCS contribute knowledge epidemiological association pulmonary disease CAD . This also add evidence use spirometry marker cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>
