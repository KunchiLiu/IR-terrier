	<brief_title>Open-label Investigation Safety Clinical Effects NTCELL Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease characterize widespread neural degeneration , particularly substantia nigra projection basal ganglia . Current therapy Parkinson 's disease purely symptomatic . There press need treatment reverse slow degeneration nigrostriatal pathway . Numerous transplant-based therapy attempt support , repair replace degenerate nigrostriatal neuron . These included transplantation foetal neuronal stem cell , gene transfer , implantation device release neural growth factor . All show effectiveness animal model , generally disappointing human study . Intracranial choroid plexus cell transplantation potential deliver biological neural agent treatment Parkinson 's disease achieve conventional treatment . The overall aim deliver neural protein compound many month basal ganglia brain enhance neural repair currently possible antiparkinsonian medication deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . As animal-derived tissue protect immune rejection transplant human , transplant usually accompany immunosuppressive therapy . However , porcine choroid plexus cell preferably implant without use immunosuppressive drug cause significant morbidity . To protect immune rejection , cell encapsulate alginate microcapsules permit inward passage nutrient outward passage biologic neural protein compound normally secrete choroid plexus cell . Alginate-encapsulated porcine choroid plexus cell implant brain without immunosuppressive drug survive rejection many month animal study . NTCELL comprise neonatal porcine choroid plexus cell encapsulate alginate microcapsules . NTCELL safely implant rat , non-human primate . Following NTCELL implant , animal chemically-induced Parkinson's-like lesion show improvement functional neurological motor abnormality associate histologic change consistent amelioration lesion . The initial dose intracranial implantation current NTCELL preparation treatment Parkinson 's disease human base effective dose non-human primate ( rhesus monkey ) model . Parkinson 's disease patient follow 26 week receive implantation NTCELL administer putamen corpus striatum side contralateral great clinical deficit . Based upon data obtain 26-week follow-up period decision make whether patient receive : - implantation second dose NTCELL - unilateral DBS - bilateral DBS - intervention The data review investigator Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , data consist clinical outcome clinimetric data , MRI scan , PET scanning , adverse event . Patients follow 48 week intervention , however decide either DBS implantation second dose NTCELL occur frequency follow-up subject protocol amendment .</detailed_description>

These criterion include exhaustion available medication treatment Parkinson 's disease , normal brain MRI , intact cognitive , psychological psychiatric function , appropriate carer support , competence willingness consent placement deep brain probe If female , childbearing capability ( 2 year postmenopausal undergone voluntary sterilisation consider enrolment ) Provision write informed consent . Patients require agree comply test visit specify protocol , ( partners/close contact ) also require consent longterm microbiological monitoring , integral part study . To assessed Week 10 4 Visit Note : criterion acceptance DBS would exclude patient comorbidities normally would exclude similar study , include uncontrolled depression , dementia , focal neurological deficit , secondary parkinsonism .
