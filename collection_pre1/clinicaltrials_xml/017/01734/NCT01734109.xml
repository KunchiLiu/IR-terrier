	<brief_summary>Negative-pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) important adjunct management wound , promote granulation tissue angiogenesis . Despite known mean facilitation wound management , research need examine whether modality superior currently use option , thus define clear indication benefit NPWT . This would also help establish role combination therapy , use NPWT simultaneous irrigation form dressing . This study aim compare treatment efficacy NPWT , NPWT plus proprietary simultaneous irrigation , traditional hospital standard care treatment grade III &amp; IV pressure ulcer . Primary endpoint study comparison reduction wound volume three treatment arm ; secondary endpoint include bacterial load , rate wound healing , preparation grafting , pain .</brief_summary>
