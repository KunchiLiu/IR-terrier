	<brief_summary>The biological membrane surround cell organelles important overall function cell . Fatty acid main structural component membrane , presence certain fatty acid alter membrane 's characteristic , subsequently alter function . Two fatty acid particular interest researcher eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) . These omega-3 fatty acid unique unsaturated structure , incorporation biological membrane appear elicit potent physiological effect . The body unable intrinsically synthesize important fatty acid , must obtain diet supplementation . EPA DHA supplementation report provide numerous positive health benefit , include decrease blood pressure improve blood lipid profile . Recent research laboratory demonstrate young men rest metabolic rate increase follow 12 week period omega fatty acid supplementation 3 g/day . Fat utilization also increase carbohydrate use decrease rest 1 hr moderate exercise challenge . These finding positive implication people interested lose weight , know whether effect occur old adult . With age , body composition change ( increase fat mass decrease lean mass ) occur may negatively affect general health , particularly normal physical functioning quality live old adult . The potential role omega 3 fatty acid increase fat oxidation increase rest metabolic rate may therapy decrease fat mass older adult . Research suggest omega 3 fatty acid may elicit additional therapeutic role reduce joint pain . Another aspect age loss lean body mass , associate attenuation skeletal muscle protein synthesis response nutritional stimulus ( amino acid insulin ) . The weakened anabolic response consider partly due defect anabolic signal cascade muscle . Research old adult report increase muscle protein signal EPA DHA supplementation response nutritional challenge . However unknown whether increase protein signal result eventual increase lean body mass . The physical functioning old adult influence body composition change , also age-related neuronal change affect velocity axonal conduction influence ability muscle generate torque rate torque develop . Muscular strength functional capacity increase report chronic resistance exercise cohort old woman supplement EPA DHA . However , effect EPA DHA intake physical strength old adult previously low EPA DHA consumption , independent exercise , currently unknown . Therefore , purpose study determine effect 12 week omega-3 supplementation 3 g/day metabolic physical health parameter community-dwelling old adult . We hypothesize EPA DHA supplementation result 1 ) decrease rest heart rate blood pressure ; 2 ) healthy blood profile ; 3 ) increase rest metabolic rate ; 4 ) great reliance fat oxidation energy rest exercise ; 5 ) decrease fat mass ; 6 ) increase lean mass , strength physical function .</brief_summary>
