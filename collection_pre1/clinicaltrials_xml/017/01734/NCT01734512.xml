	<brief_title>PNOC 001 : Phase II Study Everolimus Recurrent Progressive Low-grade Gliomas Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label study everolimus child recurrent progressive low-grade glioma . All patient receive everolimus dose 5 mg/m2/dose daily . An adaptive Simon two-stage design phase 2 study target therapy use assess efficacy primary objective . The propose treatment everolimus deem worthy investigation patient population true PFS 6-months ( PFS6 ) less 50 % . If first stage , combine sample size 25 , preliminary evidence suggest efficacy everolimus restrict patient PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation measure p-S6 positivity , total 45 patient enrol design 81 % statistical power detect true disease stabilization rate ≥70 % . If first stage preliminary evidence suggest efficacy everolimus independent PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation , total 65 patient enrol design &gt; 95 % statistical power detect true disease stabilization rate ≥70 % .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must radiographic progressive recurrent confirm WHO grade I II astrocytomas , confirm histologically initial diagnosis . Progressive recurrent disease base MRI accord definition . Eligible histology : Pilocytic Astrocytoma 90600112 Astrocytoma , Low Grade ( Fibrillary astrocytoma , WHO Grade 2 ) 10065886 Astrocytoma , Low Grade ( Lowgrade Astrocytoma , NOS , WHO Grade 2 ) 10003571 Tissue initial diagnosis recurrence must make available correlative testing . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least two dimension MRI . Patients may treatment ( chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy ) number relapse prior recurrence . Patients must receive last dose myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy least three ( 3 ) week prior study registration least six ( 6 ) week nitrosourea . Patients must receive last dose investigational biological agent &gt; 7 day prior study entry . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period extend beyond time adverse event know occur . This discussed study chair . If patient receive prior monoclonal antibody treatment , least three halflives must elapse time treatment initiation . These patient also discuss study chair . Patients must receive last fraction craniospinal focal radiation primary tumor sit &gt; 12 week ( 3 month ) prior registration . Age ≥3 ≤21 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use everolimus patient &lt; 3 year age , young child exclude study . Life expectancy great 8 week . Patients must able swallow pill . Patient must Karnofsky ( ≥ 16 year age ) Lansky Performance score ( ≤ 16 year age ) ≥50 time registration . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( ANC ≥ 1,000/mm3 , platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dL ) start therapy . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . INR ≤1.5 . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose LMW heparin &gt; 2 week time randomization ) . Patients must adequate liver function ( SGPT/ALT ≤ 2.5 time ULN bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN ) start therapy . Patients must adequate renal function ( serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 time institutional ULN age GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) start therapy . Patients must cholesterol level &lt; 350 mg/dL triglyceride &lt; 400 mg/dL start therapy . In case one exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication documentation cholesterol &lt; 350mg/dL triglyceride &lt; 400mg/dl start therapy . Patients must normal pulmonary function test age base pulse oximetry . The effect everolimus develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason everolimus know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Female patient child bear potential must breastfeed pregnant evidence negative pregnancy test . Patients receive concomitant medication may interfere study outcome . For example , patient enzyme induce anticonvulsant like phenytoin . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Close contact receive attenuated live vaccine avoid treatment everolimus . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine Hepatitis B/C blood test must do screening patient . Patients test positive Hepatitis C antibodies Hepatitis B antigen ineligible . A known history HIV seropositivity . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction everolimus . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients may therapy recurrence ( include radiation ) . Patients measurable disease MRI . Patients previously treat mTOR inhibitor . Patients know hypersensitivity everolimus rapamycins ( e.g . sirolimus , temsirolimus ) . Patients receive concurrent anticancer investigational therapy . Patients clinically significant unrelated systemic illness would compromise patient 's ability tolerate protocol therapy . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption everolimus ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection . Patients inability return followup visit assess toxicity therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year . Note : A detailed assessment Hepatitis B/C medical history risk factor must do screening patient . HBV DNA HCV RNA PCR test require screening patient positive medical history base risk factor and/or confirmation prior HBV/HCV infection .</criteria>
