	<brief_summary>The project undertake Qilu Hospital Shandong University 13 well-known hospital China . In order report efficacy safety Recombinant Human thrombopoietin combine Rituximab treatment adult primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) , compare conventional high-dose dexamethasone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin ( rhTPO ) Combining Rituximab Versus High-dose Dexamethasone Initial Treatment Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , multicentre , randomise control trial 240 primary ITP adult patient 14 medical center China . One part participant randomly select receive recombinant human thrombopoietin ( give subcutaneously dose 300Units/kgfor 14 consecutive day , follow flexible dosage depend platelet count 28th day ) , combine rituximab ( give intravenously dose 100 mg weekly 4 week , i.e . Day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; others select receive high-dose dexamethasone treatment ( give intravenously dose 40 mg daily 4 day ) . Platelet count evaluate treatment , order report conversion ratio primary ITP chronic ITP .</detailed_description>
