	<brief_summary>Hand , foot , mouth disease ( HFMD ) common viral illness infant child cause virus belong enterovirus genus picornavirus family . Although HFMD case result serious complication , outbreak HFMD cause enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) present high rate neurological complication , include meningoencephalitis , pulmonary complication , even cause infant death . HFMD cause EV71 become major emerge infectious disease Asia highly pathogenic potential EV71 clearly require attention world medical community . The phase II study inactivate vaccine ( vero cell ) EV71 complete last month Jiangsu Province China . The data phase II study suggest inactivated EV71 vaccine clinically acceptable safety good immunogenicity healthy Chinese child infant . But antibody titer EV71 find decrease significantly month 8 compare day 56 . Considering similar dynamic trend also find antibody poliovirus induce polio vaccine , whose immunization schedule contain booster dose administrate 1 1.5 year first 3 dos fundamental immunity . In order find good immunization schedule child , investigator decide perform booster immunity trial among child receive two dos EV71 vaccine ( around one year fundamental immunity ) . The investigator recruitment among child participate previous phase II trial receive EV71 vaccine , randomize ratio 2:1 receive either booster dose EV71 vaccine placebo .</brief_summary>
