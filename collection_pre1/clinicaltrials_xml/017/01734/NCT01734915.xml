	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine EGFR mutation detect CTCs . CTCs cancer cell shed solid tumor float freely bloodstream . A device call CTC-chip develop find CTCs blood patient cancer . This experimental device . Using device , investigator test participant ' blood try find CTCs EGFR mutation compare result biopsy doctor recommend . The long-term goal research develop way test EGFR mutation less invasive tumor biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order participate study need diagnosis NSCLC spread unable surgically remove . In addition , cancer must EGFR mutation must schedule ( recently perform ) biopsy check presence mutation relate targeted drug resistance . After sign consent participate study draw blood sample ( three tube blood ) . This 6 teaspoon blood . The number CTCs blood report since know number meaning impact medical care way . These result become part medical record . They keep separate , secure location . We collect information medical record store research record create . The study team use information compare detail medical history result experiment do blood . Genetic material ( DNA ) remove CTCs find blood . This genetic material store Massachusetts General Hospital study along sample participant research study . Your sample label name information identifies . Your sample study-specific code number . The code link name sample keep secure location , available investigator study select study team member . After blood draw follow status every 6 month review medical record .</detailed_description>
