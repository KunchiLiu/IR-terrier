	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer return local treatment usually respond hormone block treatment , patient eventually experience disease progression . Further chemotherapy normally lead cure dramatic improvement disease need identify new drug beneficial patient without unacceptable side effect . Prodrug chemotherapy approach inactive non-toxic agent administer patient get activate within body specific location , result high concentration cytotoxic form tumour location whilst avoid general side effect . G-202 example prodrug chemotherapy . It many general side effect convert cell toxin tumour specific location body . G-202 activate Prostate Specific Memory Antigen ( PSMA ) , substance express prostate cancer cell blood vessel solid tumour , normal cell blood vessel normal tissue . It believe activation prodrug G-202 allow drug kill cancer cell , particularly prostate cancer cell . This study evaluate activity safety G-202 men castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , mean cancer progress hormone block treatment , yet receive chemotherapy symptom CRPC . The study evaluate clinical activity safety G-202 administer three consecutive day 28-day cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study G-202 Patients With Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo screening period 4 week . Patients deem eligible enter study undergo treatment G-202 . G-202 administer intravenous infusion one hour Days 1 , 2 3 28-day treatment cycle . The G-202 dose 40 mg/m2 Day 1 66.8 mg/m2 Days 2 3 . The primary objective study determine percentage patient chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer disease progression ( radiographic clinical ) 24 week treatment G-202 . A two-stage study design use evaluate percentage patient disease progression 24 week treatment G-202 . If percent patient progression-free 24 week 15 % , clinical efficacy G-202 patient population consider unacceptably low . If , hand , percent patient progression-free 24 week least 35 % , consider sufficient evidence consider clinical investigation . The null hypothesis percent patient progression-free 24 week 15 % tested alternative hypothesis percent great 15 % one-sided 10 % significance level . In order avoid suspension accrual await interim analysis , two-stage study design evaluate survival probability continual accrual use . An interim analysis futility conduct 24 evaluable patient accrue assuming time accrual first patient accrual 24th patient least 8 month . If 24 patient accrue less 8 month , accrual continue time period date accrual first patient date accrual last patient least 8 month . If trial terminate futility interim analysis , additional 10 patient accrue total 34 patient . The two-stage design minimizes expect duration accrual null hypothesis . For interim analysis , patient discontinues participation reason safety disease progression complete three full cycle undergo 12-week follow-up assessment replace . Any replace patient include study analysis intent-to-treat safety population . Safety assess report adverse event , vital sign assessment finding physical exam routine laboratory determination . The severity adverse event laboratory finding assess accord NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) V4 .</detailed_description>
