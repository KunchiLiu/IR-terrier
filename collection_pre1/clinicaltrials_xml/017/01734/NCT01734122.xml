	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery Essential Tremor Parkinsonian Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tremor common movement disorder . Patients essential tremor ( ET ) Parkinsonian tremor ( PT ) may severely disable tremor . When tremor inadequately control medication , surgical option often offer . However , patient may prefer noninvasive treatment approach patient surgical candidate medical reason . Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) treatment use high-energy highly-focused radiation ( X-rays ) destroy tiny region brain cause tremor occur . This region know ventral intermedius nucleus thalamus area target surgical deep brain stimulator ( DBS ) treatment neurosurgical operation ( thalamotomy ) . Multiple case series publication use Gamma Knife stereotactic radiation report show stereotactic radiosurgery safe effective treatment ET PT , make standard treatment inoperable inadequately controlled tremor patient . However , radiation treatment linear accelerator machine much common Gamma Knife treatment machine United States , report large series ET PT patient treat use linear accelerator-based SRS use noninvasive mask-based targeting system . This clinical trial asks question whether linear accelerator-based SRS safe effective report Gamma Knife procedure , whether valid alternative surgical thalamotomy implantation deep brain stimulator ( DBS ) device . The primary measurement quality life relate tremor stereotactic radiosurgery treatment , secondary measurement degree tremor severity usage tremor-related medication . Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS ) standard-of-care treatment patient severe tremor . This clinical trial questionnaire-based trial involve completion 2 questionnaire consultation appointment neurology radiation oncology . The questionnaire take minute provide u valuable information severe patient 's tremor SRS treatment 3-month interval 1 year . Currently perform SRS treatment one side brain ( effect one side body ) side bad tremor treat . Financial : All associate step list consider Standard Care receive SRS treatment tremor bill patient 's insurance per usual routine . Patients receive treatment without participate clinical trial questionnaire . There financial support , compensation , travel stipend available patient participate trial . What expect : 1 . All patient interested SRS treatment tremor must evaluate movement disorder neurologist , Dr. Peter Hedera Dr. Fenna Phibbs . The neurologist ass severity tremor . Your primary physician outside neurologist must make referral Dr. Hedera Dr. Phibbs initial assessment . For clinical trial participation , questionnaire complete baseline measurement ( take minute ) . If patient appropriate candidate SRS may additional evaluation discussion entire Movement Disorder group monthly meeting . ** Please note : Parkinson 's disease patient , please come neurology evaluation `` functionally medication '' , mean NOT take morning dose Parkinson 's related medication . 2 . The patient undergo neuropsychological evaluation Dr. Scott Wylie prior SRS treatment , standard care patient consider DBS SRS treatment . 3 . The patient meet neurosurgeon , Dr. Hong Yu , involve SRS plan procedure . 4 . Patients refer SRS treatment evaluate radiation oncologist , Dr. Austin Kirschner Dr. Anthony Cmelak . At appointment , discussion include description procedure detail review risk benefit treatment . For clinical trial participation , questionnaire complete baseline assessment patient 's tremor-related quality life ( take minute ) . 5 . If patient chooses proceed SRS , department radiation oncology tight-fitting thermal plastic mask custom make fit around patient 's head CT scan head perform radiation oncology . This step take 45 minute . 6 . A specialized MRI brain obtain treatment planning . This step take 1 hour . 7 . Approximately 2 week complete consultation appointment obtain image treatment planning , single stereotactic radiation treatment perform . The SRS procedure take approximately 2.5 hour . It entirely outpatient require anesthesia . The procedure noninvasive painless ( X-ray treatment ) . During entire treatment , head hold tightly plastic mask . Oral anti-anxiety medication may give relax patient . Follow-up : 8 . At 3 month interval 1 year , patient follow-up appointment radiation oncology neurology . A brain MRI may perform interval document treatment effect brain tissue . For participation clinical trial , follow-up appointment quality life questionnaire complete radiation oncology visit severity tremor questionnaire complete neurology visit . 9 . At 6 month SRS treatment , neuropsychological evaluation perform . All patient interested stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) participate questionnaire-based clinical trial feel free call contact phone number list physician refer patient consultation Dr. Peter Hedera Dr. Fenna Phibbs neurology department Vanderbilt .</detailed_description>
