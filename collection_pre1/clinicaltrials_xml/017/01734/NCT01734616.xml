	<brief_summary>With age , muscle tend waste 0.5-1 % per year , 80 year old may 70 % muscle possess 50 . Muscle loss make hard carry task require strength , keep body balanced continue activity prolong period , together may contribute loss independence increase risk fall . The cause muscle loss age appear reduction muscle building response food . The known decrease limb blood flow age muscle may go way explain may less nutrient delivery muscle . The investigator want test know decrease limb blood flow age match decrease proportion blood deliver directly muscle , rather fat connective tissue . If investigator expect see improvement ability muscle maintain via good capture amino acid protein . The investigator also want test 20 week resistance exercise training drink cocktail mixture high flavanol cocoa ( increase blood flow ) vitamin C improve limb blood flow old muscle help reduce muscle wasting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dysfunction Nutritive Blood Flow Determinant Anabolic Resistance Older People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By 2020 , 20 % UK population 65 . Muscle mass strong predictor healthy age longevity . Basal limb blood flow decrease advance age ; reduce limb perfusion may contribute sarcopenia , undesirable loss muscle mass accompany advance age . The investigator previous work show deficit mechanism muscle protein synthesis old people , exist may counter still unknown . After normal feeding , increase amino acid availability ( stimulating muscle protein synthesis ) insulin availability ( inhibit muscle protein breakdown ) good effect muscle old people extent young ; investigator call `` anabolic resistance '' . The investigator recently show leg blood flow elderly people low young rest basal state also rest 2.5 hour food food + exercise . The matching blood flow metabolism advantageous skeletal muscle , marry demand oxygen nutrient delivery ; reduce limb perfusion old people may contribute inability maintain muscle mass ageing . The investigator recently show resistance train markedly improve leg blood flow response elderly person . They believe major benefit resistance exercise increase endothelium dependent vasodilation response feed moderate exercise , need prove . It become recognise `` bulk '' limb blood flow may important muscle nutrient uptake call 'nutritive ' blood flow important determinant . Recent work suggest bulk limb flow partition skin , bone muscle even within muscle partition 'nutritive ' 'non-nutritive ' . The nutritive route intimate contact muscle cell non-nutritive route act vascular shunt think , least part , via vessel nourish fat connective tissue cell . Nutritive flow may component flow susceptible dysfunction5 ( e.g . type 2 diabetes obesity ) may also susceptible improvement accustom exercise possibly nutraceutical treatment . The investigator test hypothesis : ( 1 ) muscle nutritive blood flow determinant protein balance , pharmacologically induced vasodilation acutely stimulating muscle synthesis reduce breakdown , ( 2 ) low nutritive flow elderly people contribute anabolic resistance ameliorate resistance training nutraceutical flow enhancer . The investigator wish study 50 healthy volunteer subject ( NHS patient ) follow : 18-28 men ( 10 ) 65-75 men ( 40 ) comparable body mass index ( 24-28 kg•m2 ) sedentary normally undertake customary resistance training . The investigator data suggest sexual dimorphism anabolic response feed old subject restrict study men . After obtain write consent , subject undergo medical examination , activity questionnaire DEXA scan . Ten elderly men undergo single acute study . In addition investigator study 10 young men condition . Ten elderly men undergo acute study 20 week supervise whole-body resistance training , current practice gym site Derby . Ten elderly men undergo single acute study give , addition standard acute study protocol 3 drink high flavanol cocoa 3 x 500 mg vitamin C. If positive acute effect drink observe final ten elderly men undergo acute study week ingest 3 high flavanol cocoa + 1000 mg vitamin C per day . To optimise detail study condition investigator also study 10 normal healthy volunteer 18-75 simply CEUS contrast agent methacholine infusion , without blood sampling biopsy . Subjects fast overnight receive prim constant intravenous ( antecubital vein ) infusion stable isotope label amino acid duration study blood sample take arterial cannula two femoral venous cannulae regular interval quantify tracer enrichment measure glucose uptake insulin . In first phase study , subject ' bulk femoral artery blood flow measure 50 , 70 , 90 110 min Doppler Ultrasound ( USS ) . Nutritive blood flow measure defined area quadriceps control leg Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound ( CEUS ) use Phillips iU22 110 min . This involve single intravenous administration SonoVue® contrast agent . At 120 min second phase study begin dextrose mixed amino acid intravenous infusion ( antecubital vein ) remainder study . Methacholine chloride ( Provocholine® ; Methapharm Inc. ) NaCl ( 0.9 % , prepared QMC pharmacy ) infuse ( 2-12 µg/min ) one femoral artery double femoral artery flow 150 min . Bulk femoral artery flow measure ( Doppler Ultrasound ) , time legs 170 , 190 , 210 230 min . Nutritive flow measure second time , legs CEUS 230 min . Four muscle biopsy ( 150-300 mg ) vastus lateralis take accord protocol snap-frozen liquid nitrogen . The end point i. muscle protein synthesis , ii . muscle protein breakdown , iii . bulk femoral blood flow iv . nutritive femoral blood flow subject different age follow different exercise nutraceutical intervention . A power calculation suggest study need 10 subject per group detect ( α 0.05 β 0.85 ) 25 % difference group biological variable , result investigator able achieve similar work past .</detailed_description>
