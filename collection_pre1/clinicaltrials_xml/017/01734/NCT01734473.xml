	<brief_summary>Weight loss commonly occur patient COPD , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Loss muscle protein generally central component weight loss independently increase mortality . This study provide relevant clinical information regard anabolic property specific dietary substrate co-active anabolic effect . Hypotheses : 1 ) That supplementation hydrolyze casein-based protein meal addition carbohydrates anabolic hydrolyze casein-based protein meal without carbohydrate COPD patient healthy old adult ; 2 ) That leucine addition hydrolyze casein-based protein meal enhances protein anabolic response COPD patient healthy old adult carbohydrates add protein meal ; 3 ) That COPD patient efficient protein anabolic response hydrolyze casein-based protein meal healthy old adult . A fifth study day add measure protein requirement include individual able interpret response intervention study day , test hypothesis subject low protein requirement respond less intervention leucine and/or carbohydrate . For 5th additional test day first approach 10 COPD 10 healthy subject already complete first 4 study day ( sign re-contact form ) come back extra test day . We ( pre- ) screen subject phone eligibility check change recent medical history ( help ( pre- ) screen questionnaire CRF ) . If inclusion criterion still meet , subject ask provide write re-consent . If necessary , recruit new subject complete one four test day ( i.e . test day hydrolyze casein-based protein meal carbohydrate provide ) additional 5th study day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study involve 5 study day . The duration first 4 study day approximately 6.5 hour per day duration 5th study day approximately 8 hour . On first 4 study day effect casein protein meal without leucine carbohydrate examine . On fifth study day effect 4 different level casein protein carbohydrate intake sip feeding ( every 20 minute ) examine . Also , subject receive mixture amino acid ( little part protein ) little bit heavy normal , call stable isotope . This so-called stable isotope method investigate protein behavior body ( protein kinetics ) . Altogether 75 ml blood drawn per study day ass outcome measure .</detailed_description>
