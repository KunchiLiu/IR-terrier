	<brief_summary>Background : - Myositis rare disease body immune cell attack muscle tissue . It cause muscle weakness , swell , pain . It develop people history muscle problem . Environmental exposure may determine develops myositis . Genes may also affect development disease . - Some people serve military develop myositis . However , military personnel . Researchers want compare military personnel without myositis . They look common factor might lead disease . Objectives : - To study environmental risk factor myositis military personnel . Eligibility : - Military personnel develop myositis period service . - Healthy military personnel myositis another autoimmune disease . Design : - Participants physical exam medical history . - Participants fill form environmental exposure , particularly military . The question ask past infection , vaccine medication , personal habit . They also ask participant occupation military service deployment . - Participants also provide blood sample study . - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Myositis , autoimmune muscle disease , likely develops result environmental exposure genetically susceptible person . Preliminary data suggest trend increase incidence myositis military personnel last decade unknown reason . Although environmental exposure preliminarily associate myositis civilian population , confirm . In addition , study assess exposure might result development myositis military personnel . Military personnel experience number intense , unique exposure , often relatively short interval , include different stress , novel vaccine , distinct occupational exposure , battlefield injury unique chemical field deployment , differ exposure non-military population . Therefore , propose protocol consist three complementary approach attempt determine environmental factor associate development myositis active duty military personnel initial understand possible mechanism involve . In first approach , assess risk factor case-control study 300 patient develop myositis active duty comparing 1500 active duty military personnel ( randomly select , match 5:1 gender , race , age military service within 10 year ) diagnose autoimmune disease chronic muscle disease . For first approach , analyze exist military database information medication , vaccine , infection , co-existing medical condition , military occupation , deployment , worldwide active duty location . In second case-control approach , attempt define environmental factor associate development myositis develop military personnel ( n=150 ) compare 150 similarly match military personnel diagnose autoimmune disease chronic muscle disease . This second approach differ first approach , subject prospectively enrol assess single clinic visit confirm diagnose examine patient questionnaire focus environmental exposure , include captured military database . A third laboratory approach identify , exploratory study , global DNA methylation epigenetic change , microRNA mRNA profile peripheral blood muscle tissue 18 subject ( six PM six DM compare six non-myositis control enrol second approach ) ass effect select environmental exposure parameter . These complementary approach enhance understanding environmental factor possible mechanism associate development myositis military , provide insight environmental risk factor may also relevant development myositis non-military population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : For Aim 1 study : The inclusion criterion myositis subject : Diagnosis PM , DM IBM military service . Subjects may active duty longer active duty personnel . A matrix diagnosis myositis base ICD9 code , laboratory test medical record attempt match criterion probable definite PM , DM IBM The inclusion criterion match control subject : The gender , race , age within 10 year , service military within 10 year myositis subject . The exclusion criterion control subject : A matrix diagnosis autoimmune chronic muscle disease base ICD9 code medical record . For Aims 2 3 study : The inclusion criterion enrollment myositis subject : Diagnosis myositis military service base criterion probable definite PM DM , clinically pathologically define possible IBM . Subjects may active duty longer active duty personnel . Able willing give inform consent , complete questionnaire donate blood sample . The inclusion criterion match control : Persons military experience attend clinic hospital myositis subject match , available , volunteer general community ( participate military VA hospital , private HCPs , NIH Normal volunteer program ) , gender race age ( within 10 year ) military service period ( within 10 year ) match myositis subject . Controls without recognize autoimmune chronic muscle disease , able willing give inform consent , complete questionnaire donate blood sample . The exclusion criterion protocol subject : Medical illness judgment investigator allow safe blood draw clinical evaluation need study participation . Chronic muscle disease idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ( i.e . infectious , dystrophic , metabolic , toxic druginduced myopathy ) . Cognitive impairment . Not able willing give inform consent . Age &lt; 18 year . Current incarceration There gender ethnic restriction enrollment study . HIV exclusion study two follow reason : It impact study procedure test . HIV may one viral risk factor investigate .</criteria>
