	<brief_summary>Chronic urticaria define occurrence widespread daily almost daily wheal least 6 week , may accompany angioedema . While wheal transient , resolution angioedema slow wheal could take 72 hour . The natural course chronic urticaria self-limited , spontaneous remission occasional relapse . The investigator calculate 0.6 % ( 95 % CI ( Confidence Interval ) : 0.4-0.8 ) prevalence population study . It great impact patient ' quality life . In recent national survey patient attend Allergy Department , chronic urticaria disease great impact mental quality life allergic disease . In spite high morbidity disease impact quality life , available treatment . Last guideline recommend initiate treatment antihistamine response increase dose off-label four-fold ; systemic corticosteroid also recommend short tapering response , treatment clinical evidence employ cyclosporine . As additional data , treatment cost disease calculate 2047 $ /year . In past year employ monoclonal humanized anti-Immunoglobulin IgE ( iGE ) antibody ( Omalizumab ) treat moderate severe asthma good result . The rationale approach chronic urticaria Omalizumab inhibits bind IgE high affinity IgE receptor ( FceRI ) decrease FceRI expression surface mast cell basophils immunoglobulin G cross link alpha subunit basophil degranulation prevented.The hypothesis investigator work monoclonal IgE antibody Omalizumab could effective control chronic urticaria symptom patient non respondent conventional therapy . The investigator hypothesize Omalizumab able revert basophil mast cell activation present chronic urticaria .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Omalizumab ( XolairÂ® ) Treat Chronic Urticaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective present study demonstrate adequate methodology efficacy safety Omalizumab new indication chronic autoimmune autoimmune urticaria . For purpose , The investigator perform Multicenter double- blind , placebo- control , randomize cross-over ( 2x2 ) trial . The investigator include 20 patient include female male adult non respondent antihistamine supra therapeutic dose . Efficacy evaluate Urticaria Activity Score 7 ( UAS7 ) , Chronic Urticaria Quality Life validate questionnaire , patient ' symptom card use medication . Dropouts treatment group also evaluate . The investigator also record leave day urticaria Emergency Department visit , well adverse reaction treatment . The present study would allow offer Health System evidence evaluate convenience approve use Omalizumab new indication chronic urticaria treatment . It important take account present study investigator include autoimmune non-autoimmune urticaria , since efficacy could differ urticaria type . In way , Health Authorities ( AEMPS ) would independent additional information obtain adequate methodology case new indication request . The investigator also want stress near future company manufacture antibody could ask new indication chronic urticaria . A third outcome expect offer information last effect drug symptom ' free week dose . This information would provide washing period data patient allocate placebo active drug arm . This would give much need information best dose schedule protocol .</detailed_description>
