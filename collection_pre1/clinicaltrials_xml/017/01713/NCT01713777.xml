	<brief_summary>The United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) specific rule generic drug company must follow get generic copy seizure medication approve . Currently , FDA approve generic drug require study normal volunteer n't epilepsy take one dose generic drug follow series blood test . Some people epilepsy physician complain side effect loss seizure control take generic drug , one know complaint truly problem generic drug . When FDA test generic copy lamotrigine ( LTG ) , blood level measure volunteer receive generic lamotrigine tablet allow fall within specific range . This research test whether two different manufacturer 's generic lamotrigine , fall different part range , perform similar way give people epilepsy every day several week period . The two product call GENERIC A GENERIC B . The generic form study drug lamotrigine test study approve FDA treatment seizure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Qualified subject screen upon fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion sign informed consent enrol study enter randomization phase ( 2-30 day ) . Subjects randomize accord seal allocation list balance sequence provide site prior first subject enrollment . Subjects withdraw prior complete second period replace randomized manner . The randomization list generate study statistical group . There four test period two sequence sequence-randomized study . During two test period subject receive twice daily dose `` low '' generic product two period subject receive twice daily dose `` high '' generic product . Each subject return end 14+/-1 day stable dose period in-facility 12-hour pharmacokinetic ( PK ) session collect sample determine Cmax AUCs ( area curve ) . Each in-facility pharmacokinetic testing separate 14+/-1 day stable dosing period . A final follow-up phone evaluation conduct 12-16 day ( target 14 day ) last dose study medication . A single make-up period permit issue single period . During study subject continue usual concomitant medication , include AEDs ( anti epilepsy drug ) , without change . Investigators compare AED level measure Cmax AUC group use average bioequivalence ( ABE ) individual bioequivalence ( IBE ) criterion . Average bioequivalence establish 90 % confidence interval geometric mean Cmax AUCs disparate generic product compare entirely within 80 % -125 % range ( FDA criterion bioequivalence ) use two one-sided standard analysis . Otherwise product consider bioequivalent . Study Population : Approximately 36 subject ( 30 subject completion ) . Number center : 3 site enrol approximately 12 subject . Duration study : Approximately 1 year .</detailed_description>
