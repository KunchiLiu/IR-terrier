	<brief_summary>At acute stage cerebral ischaemia , effective drug increase proportion patient survive without dependency thrombolytic therapy intravenous ( i.v . ) tissue-plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) . This treatment enter routine practice similar result trial , various place world include Europe Japan . Stroke dementia closely relate . About one patient ten dementia first-ever stroke , one three dementia recurrent stroke . Pre-existing dementia associate bad outcome stroke , pre-existing cognitive impairment without dementia associate high rate institutionalisation within 3 year . In many patient cognitive impairment due summation effect vascular Alzheimer lesion brain . More patient nowadays eligible rt-PA already know demented admission . A retrospective study conduct cohort patient dementia ischaemic stroke treat rtPA suggest increase risk cerebral bleed death compare non demented patient . However , pre-existing cognitive impairment possibly associate ( ) increase risk bleed patient cognitive impairment , ( ii ) high sensitivity neurotoxic effect rt-PA brain tissue . Japanese patient differ European patient high risk spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage , high proportion patient small-vessel disease . The primary objective OPHELIE-COG study determine whether ischaemic stroke patient treat i.v . rt-PA likely poor outcome ( define modify Rankin scale 2 6 month 3 ) presence pre-existing cognitive impairment dementia . The secondary objective determine whether ( ) increase risk symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage , ( ii ) proportion patient poor outcome low expect placebo group randomise trial patient similar range baseline severity , ( iii ) influence cognitive state outcome differs Japanese European patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The French part OPHELIE-COG run ancillary study OPHELIE , multicenter French study conduct clinical centre Strokavenir research network ( co-PI Didier Leys , Lille Denis Vivien , Caen ) . OPHELIE approve ethical committee investigator-driven study support INSERM , University Lille Nord de France Lille University hospital . OPHELIE include prospectively patient treat i.v . rt-PA acute cerebral ischaemia participate centre test hypothesis single/two chain-tPA ratio infusion influence 3-month outcome , evaluate score 0 1 modified Rankin scale ( mRS ) . OPHELIE-COG conducted cohort patient ancillary analysis OPHELIE . The Japanese part OPHELIE-COG conduct In patient receive i.v . rt-PA acute cerebral ischaemia participate Japanese centre . Japanese centre part OPHELIE study . No specific investigation necessary purpose study . There variable record part usual management stroke patient treat i.v . rt-PA. Following-up patient 3 month mRS recommend monitor result thrombolysis centre able deliver treatment . The informant Questionnaire Cognitive Decline Elderly ( IQCODE ) part care centre however highly recommended influence pre-existing cognitive state stroke outcome general . The systematic assessment pre-existing dementia conduct within 48 hour stroke onset French Japanese translation short version IQCODE . Patients already followed-up neurologist diagnose demented stroke classify previously demented irrespective IQCODE score . Patients IQCODE MMSE score 30 discharge classify cognitively normal . Patients IQCODE MMSE score 29 less eligible . The sample size calculation French patient perform primary objective OPHELIE assuming expect difference 5 % primary end-point alpha beta risk 5 % 20 % respectively expect proportion patient mRS score 0-1 40 % month-3 , accord trial , observational registry data publish Lille centre baseline NIH score 11 : 900 patient necessary . To detect absolute difference 10 % primary end-point alpha risk 5 % power 80 % , sample size 1040 eligible patient necessary , assume 12 16 % patient criteria pre-existing dementia . This 10 % absolute difference proportion patient mRS 0-1 month 3 without pre-existing dementia corresponds difference beneficial effect rt-PA may lose , take account approximately 30 % patient placebo , 40 % rt-PA mRS 0-1 month 3 median baseline NIH score 11 . Assuming 20 % patient include OPHELIE eligible OPHELIE-COG accord proportion exclusion find previous study IQCODE , expect recruitment 720 patient French arm study . The 320 patient recruit Japan , mean 400 patient recruited compensate usual 20 % rate patient IQCODE due time . An intermediate analysis perform inclusion 500 patient arrive 3 month follow-up re-evaluate sample size .</detailed_description>
