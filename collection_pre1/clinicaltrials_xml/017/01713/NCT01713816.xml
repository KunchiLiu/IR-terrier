	<brief_title>Human Brain Antioxidants During Oxidative Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective proposal advance mission improve health well-being old Americans augment ongoing dementia prevention treatment initiative . It undertakes research dementia associate normal age AD . A new scientist develop novel powerful human brain antioxidant assay use state-of-the art instrumentation . The approach translate clinical environment disseminate use new research . Specifically , concentration two important antioxidant , ascorbate ( Asc ) glutathione ( GSH ) measure noninvasively human brain . One aim measure whether recent find low brain GSH concentration occipital cortex cognitively normal elder subject also find posterior cingulate cortex , whether human brain Asc homeostasis persist brain region . A complementary specific aim determine whether low brain GSH concentration also occur oxidative stress associate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . At time , data measure subject AD potential advance powerful new technology toward discover early stage biomarker . A sub aim make technology available wide range physician investigator . As , data processing fully automate use commercially available software . This novel noninvasive technology facilitates paradigm shift systemic assay quantify antioxidant directly affect brain region . The approach take advantage state art 7 T instrumentation develop analogous method clinical 3 T scanner . The process optimize magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) quantification brain Asc GSH concentration necessitate reliable quantification extensive neurochemical profile ( i.e . 19 brain metabolite ) , include four compound typically observe . Spectra acquire stimulate echo acquisition mode ( STEAM ) de-convolved quantitatively contribution metabolite contribute discernable resonance use linear combination model approach ( LCModel ) . Reliable quantification brain GSH Asc concentration first achieve use ultra high field MRS multiple transmit coil technology accompany radiofrequency ( B1 ) shimming , translate low field clinical platform . Successful completion determine whether low brain glutathione concentration widespread elder human brain whether difference exacerbate AD .</detailed_description>
