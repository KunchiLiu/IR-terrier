	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Adjuvant Chemotherapy With GS Biliary Tract Cancer Undergoing Resection Without Major Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery currently remain potentially curative treatment biliary tract cancer ( BTC ) , patient develop recurrence . Therefore , effective adjuvant chemotherapy require increase curability surgery prolong survival patient . However , date , standard adjuvant chemotherapy establish , guideline BTC treatment recommend trial adjuvant chemotherapy carry . Recently , two report gemcitabine ( GEM ) + S-1 combination ( GS ) chemotherapy surgical resection patient BTC . At Iwate Medical University , Takahara , et al. , perform phase I study use regimen repeat 28 day 1 course . Patients receive GEM day 1 day 15 , S-1 day 1 day 14 . The recommend dose 1,000 mg/m² GEM S-1 80 mg/m² pancreatoduodenectomy . The 2-year survival rate 34 patient receive GS therapy 78.6 % ( Cancer Chemother Pharmacol . 2012 May ; 69 ( 5 ) :1127-33 ) . At Hiroshima University , cycle chemotherapy consist intravenous GEM 700 mg/m² day 1 oral S-1 50 mg/m² 7 consecutive day , follow 1-week break chemotherapy ( 14days 1 course ) . Fifty patient receive GS therapy significantly well 3-year survival rate ( 57 % ) compare 53 case surgery alone ( 30 % ) . The GS adjuvant chemotherapy feasible adverse event minimal ( Ann Surg . 2009 Dec ; 250 ( 6 ) :950-6 ) . Thus , regimens two study 14 28 day 1 course . There regimen consist GEM day 1 , 8 S-1 14 consecutive day , follow 1-week break chemotherapy ( 21days 1 course ) , frequently use unresectable BTC pancreatic cancer . Though hepatectomy frequently perform surgery BTC , unclear effect anticancer agent affect hepatectomy . Because GEM metabolize cytidine deaminase primarily liver , ability metabolize GEM hepatectomy think decrease . Some clinical study demonstrate patient undergone hepatectomy could tolerate standard dose schedule GEM . For adjuvant chemotherapy GEM , necessary separately examine whether patient undergone hepatectomy . Considering present condition , aim assess safety efficacy GEM + S-1 combination chemotherapy ( 21days 1 course regimen , frequently use unresectable BTC ) BTC patient undergo curative resection without hepatectomy .</detailed_description>
