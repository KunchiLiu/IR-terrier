	<brief_summary>Investigators propose study single agent activity pazopanib Phase II trial patient relapse refractory small cell lung cancer . Because patient limited treatment option , use investigational agent patient population support current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline . Using correlative biologic study evaluate anti angiogenic activity pazopanib absence concomitant chemotherapy allow u delineate response due drug effect angiogenesis . Pazopanib dose determine 800 mg daily per initial recommend dose approved FDA EMA , monotherapy advance Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer tumor initially respond chemotherapy radiotherapy , however , associate poor prognosis since initial response nearly always follow relapse metastasis . The response subsequent therapy limit duration response patient . Patients SCLC high rate metastasis presentation suggest angiogenesis particularly important cancer , furthermore study show microvessel density VEGF expression SCLC tumor sample correlate development metastasis poor prognosis . Furthermore VEGF expression factor retain significant inverse correlation survival assess multivariate analysis . Pazopanib potent , small molecule competitive inhibitor tyrosine kinase activity ( VEGFR 1 ) , VEGFR 2 , VEGFR 3 , platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) , c kit , capable inhibit downstream signal receptor . The IC50 pazopanib VEGFR 2 10nm , IC50 VEGFR 1 &lt; 50nm . Currently number study underway evaluation pazopanib treatment NSCLC . Administering pazopanib patient relapse SCLC offer attractive choice patient limit therapeutic choice . The high rate metastasis highlight need alternative treatment act directly growth invasion tumor subsequent development metastasis , rather solely cell proliferation .</detailed_description>
