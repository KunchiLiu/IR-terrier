	<brief_summary>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) one bad prognoses human cancer consider sanctuary , resistant drug use . Identification new molecular target involve pathogenesis urgently need require proper innovative efficacy assessment . This proof-of-concept trial study `` dynamic '' tumor response administration short course ( 4 week ) neoadjuvant combination gemcitabine Hedgehog inhibitor ( Vismodegib ) surgery patient operable pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Tumor Perfusion Chemotherapy Combining Gemcitabine Vismodegib Before Surgery Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer characterize high stromal density hypoperfused tumor , preclude cytotoxics delivery epithelial tumoral compartment . There thus rationale combine chemotherapy antistromal drug like Hedgehog inhibitor . Targeting resectable primary tumor offer appropriate setting ( 1 ) evaluate monitor early treatment effect tumor , ( 2 ) correlate dynamic imaging change ( perfusion diffusion coefficient ) pre- post-therapeutic tissue change , ( 3 ) identify specific predictive biomarkers drug use ( i.e . gemcitabine transporter Hedgehog pathway gene protein ) ( 4 ) assess early `` dynamic biomolecular response '' predict treatment benefit patient outcome .</detailed_description>
