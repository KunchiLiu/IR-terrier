	<criteria>Histologically cytologically proven acute leukemia ( AML ALL ) hematologic malignancy ( DLBCL MM ) use standard diagnosis criterion . Acute leukemia include de novo secondary preexist myelodysplastic syndrome , accord World Health Organization 2008 classification . For DLBCL , archive formaldehydefixed paraffinembedded block must available . Has fail standard therapy standard treatment contraindicate : Acute leukemia participant : &lt; 60 year old second relapse relapse allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( aSCT ) regardless number relapse ; &gt; 60 year old first relapse diseasefree interval ( DFI ) &lt; 12 month relapse ; irrespective age , participant relapse aSCT , time elapse since aSCT &gt; 90 day ; participant Bcell ALL : Philadelphia chromosome positive ( Ph+ ) must receive ≥2 line therapy , include 2 bcrabl tyrosinekinase ( TK ) inhibitor ( among imatinib , nilotinib dasatinib ) , 1 line include 1 TK inhibitor , relapse/refractoriness associate detection resistance mutation inhibitor DLBCL participant : Failed 2 standard line therapy ( ≥1 contain antiCD20 monoclonal antibody ) , treatment contraindicate MM participant : Adequately expose least one alkylating agent , one corticosteroid , one immunomodulatory drug ( IMiD ) bortezomib , treatment contraindicate . For participant evaluable disease : Advanced leukemia participant must &gt; 5 % bone marrow blast study entry , without alternative causality ( e.g . bone marrow regeneration ) DLBCL participant must ≥1 nonirradiated tumor mass ≥15 mm ( long axis lymph node ) ≥10 mm ( short axis lymph node extranodal lesion ) spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . MM participant must ≥1 follow : serum monoclonal component &gt; 1 g/dL ( IgG ) , &gt; 0.5 g/dL ( IgA ) , BenceJones ( BJ ) proteinuria &gt; 200 mg/24h , measurable plasmacytoma ( previously irradiate ) . Life expectancy ≥3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . Off previous therapy ≥3 week prior first study drug administration full recovery previous toxicity , except 1 ) hydroxyurea single agent combination ( e.g . + 6Mercaptopurine [ 6MP ] ) control hyperleukocytosis , stop ≥48 hour , 2 ) rituximab , stop ≥3 week . Recovery nonhematologic toxic effect prior treatment grade ≤1 , accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCICTC ) classification , except alopecia . Adequate bone marrow function . Adequate calculate creatinine clearance . Adequate liver function test . Complete baseline disease assessment workup prior first study drug administration . History prior malignancy previously treat curative intent &gt; 3 year ago without relapse ( tumor ) basal cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , superficial bladder cancer , high grade intestinal polyp treat adequately , regardless DFI . Pregnant lactate woman woman childbearing potential use adequate contraception . Male participant use adequate contraception . Peripheral cytopenia ( i.e . autoimmune hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia ) . Acute promyelocytic leukemia clinically uncontrolled ( i.e . bleed ) disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) . Chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) immunosuppressive therapy control GVHD . Uncontrolled leptomeningeal disease . Other tumor location necessitate urgent therapeutic intervention ( palliative care , surgery radiation therapy ) , spinal cord compression , compressive mass , uncontrolled painful lesion , bone fracture , etc . Unable swallow oral medication , gastrointestinal condition ( e.g . malabsorption , resection ) deem jeopardize intestinal absorption . Other serious illness medical condition , , investigator 's opinion could hamper understand study participant , participant 's compliance study treatment , participant 's safety interpretation study result . These condition include ( restrict ) : 1 . Congestive heart failure angina pectoris except medically control . Previous history myocardial infarction within 1 year study entry , uncontrolled hypertension arrhythmia . 2 . Existence significant neurologic psychiatric disorder impair ability obtain consent . 3 . Uncontrolled infection . 4 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity Concurrent treatment experimental therapy participation another clinical trial within 30 day prior first study drug administration . Concurrent treatment treatment within 30 day prior first study drug administration anticancer therapy , except hydroxyurea ( +/ 6MP ) control hyperleukocytosis . Concomitant treatment corticosteroid except chronic treatment ≤30 mg methylprednisolone daily equivalent dose corticosteroid .</criteria>
