	<brief_summary>The patient 's neuroblastoma come back , go away . The cancer harder treat . The investigator would like patient 's research study determine safety dosage special cell may make patient 's immune system fight cancer . To investigator put two special gene neuroblastoma cancer cell grow lab . The gene put make cancer cell produce lymphotactin , natural substance attracts immune system cell cancer , IL-2 natural substance may help immune system kill cancer cell . Some cell put patient 's body . Studies cancer animal cancer cell grown laboratory suggest substance like lymphotactin IL-2 help body kill cancer cell . A treatment similar use twelve child previously similar treatment use adult cancer . This research study . The investigator know best amount special cell use , different child get different number cell . The purpose study learn side effect safe `` dosage '' special cell . Participation study last 15 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator grow neuroblastoma cell laboratory put two specially produce mouse virus ( retrovirus ) carry lymphotactin IL-2 gene . These lymphotactin IL-2 gene mean help immune system fight cancer . The modified cancer cell inject patient 's skin . There four shot . The second subsequent shot ten time many cell produce lymphotactin first . The patient normally shots outpatient . Depending response ( patient 's cancer stay gotten small ) , patient may able four shot . Tests treatment : If patient 's blood test HIV , virus cause AIDS , investigator need test . If virus present , research treatment use . Before second shot , 2 week later , investigator remove modify cell patient 's body study . This do skin biopsy place cell inject . These test see whether change make laboratory kill cancer cell . To study immunity work patient 's body blood sample take two four day injection . This may repeat 5-7 day injection patient 's doctor think necessary . After patient stop receive injection , blood draw need repeat month year , year fifteen year . The patient need come clinic day investigator take blood need see Texas Children 's Cancer Center weekly interval 6 week , every week 6 week , monthly year . Then patient see clinic contact study personnel year 15 year . Additional visit may necessary . To see research treatment work , CAT scan , MRIs , bone scan ( different type x-ray ) do . Investigators also take bone marrow biopsy ( bone marrow remove use needle look microscope ) . These test do prior treatment repeat eight week later . In addition , patient receives second set four injection , test repeat six month . If neuroblastoma responding ( gotten large ) , investigator offer patient treatment chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
