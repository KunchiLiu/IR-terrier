	<brief_title>Dabrafenib Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability GSK2118436 ( dabrafenib ) give pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) well determine maximum tolerate dose regimen patient BRAF mutate advanced malignant tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate pharmacokinetics two study drug identify potential drug-drug interaction . II . Determine pharmacogenomics microarray test . III . Perform genotyping tumor objective tumor response rate identify . IV . Assess objective tumor response rate . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 ( daily day 1 BID day 3-28 course 1 ) , pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ( day 2-28 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
