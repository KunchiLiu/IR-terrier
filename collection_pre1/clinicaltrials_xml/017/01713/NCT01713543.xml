	<brief_summary>Background : Falls lead cause injury among old adult Singapore , fall among elderly preventable risk predictable . Translating understand fall etiology integrated clinical public health program accessible elderly critical health service delivery challenge . Hypothesis : An evidence-based program screening , risk modification physical therapy deliver community set reduce recurrent fall incidence among high-risk group elderly recently discharge community . Methodology : This randomize controlled trial target patient see Emergency Department ( ED ) fall fall-related injury least 65 year old discharge home . Upon sign informed consent form , participant follow nine month baseline assessment participant randomize either control intervention group . The participant intervention group provide multifactorial program screening , risk modification physical therapy focus progressive strength , balance , gait train either individualized program group set community first three month date randomization . The number recurrent fall monitored via fall prevention diary maintain ( ) participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To develop demonstrate feasibility effectiveness multifactorial , community-based falls prevention program screening , risk modification , progressive physical therapy target vulnerable elderly Singaporeans high-risk fall . Methodology : This two-year , multi-center , two-arm , parallel group , randomize control trial divide three phase : ( 1 ) pre-study , ( 2 ) intervention , ( 3 ) analysis . During pre-study phase , overseas expert train local physiotherapist community health worker administer deliver falls prevention program . Engaging hospital-based physiotherapist deliver home-based assessment exercise program maximize likelihood long-term sustainability intervention program . In addition , manual develop physiotherapist guide evaluation risk factor assessment , home environment assessment , appropriate referral different health care provider , selection exercise program progressive , challenge optimal intensity duration . Manuals risk factor assessment share blinded assessor . The intervention phase divide two phase : three-month `` Active Intervention Phase '' six-month `` Maintenance Phase . '' In begin active intervention phase , participant intervention group receive detail fall risk assessment baseline assessment physiotherapist . The risk factor assess follow : 1 . Poor vision : Referral ophthalmologist correction 2 . Polypharmacy : Referral AIC management medication use five medication 3 . Environmental Hazards : Caregiver education suitable recommendation accord CDC guideline modify risk removal rug , change safer footwear , use non-slip bath mat , additional lighting night . 4 . Deficiencies gait , balance mobility : Physiotherapist-supervised program gait training , balance strengthening exercise In analysis phase , collect data analyze . The primary outcome measure study number faller entire study period . The number fall captured fall prevention diary maintain ( ) participant . Procedures : The elderly see ED fall fall-related injury screen participation study . Once consent take , study participant give assessment physiotherapist baseline assess sociodemographic characteristic , functional status measure Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) , two-minute walk test , history fall , cognitive impairment measure Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) , quality life ( EQ-5D-5L EQ-VAS ) , health care utilization , medical history ( polypharmacy , orthostatic vital sign , self-reporting eyesight hearing ) . At end baseline assessment , participant assign either control intervention group . Before start exercise session , participant intervention group . Need complete Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) medical evaluation physician ensure participant fit physical activity . Based SPPB score baseline assessment , participant categorize either high-risk ( SPPB &lt; 6 ) low-to-moderate-risk ( SPPB &gt; 6 ) fall . High-risk patient give individualized PT-supervised program physical therapy specifically target impairment interfere engage exercise group set . The goal tailor physical therapy session modify impairment transition patient evidence-based exercise program . Low-to-moderate-risk patient directly enrol evidence-based group exercise program . The group exercise program offer one-hour session , twice weekly intervention period . At end active intervention phase , participant transition maintenance phase encourage continue exercise also refer Health Promotion Board 's STEP program . The participant ask end active intervention phase ( three month date randomization ) end study period ( nine month date randomization ) functional status , history fall , cognitive impairment , quality life , health care utilization , medical history blind assessor . Recurrent fall incidence monitor participant ' self-reporting monthly fall diary well monthly phone call conduct study coordinator entire study period .</detailed_description>
