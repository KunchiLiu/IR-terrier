	<detailed_description>The purpose open label , phase I/II study evaluate safety efficacy rituximab child age 18 month 18 year , severe , chronic ITP . Eligible patient either primary secondary ITP treat rituximab week 4 dos , follow one year . The primary secondary objective safety efficacy follow : Primary 1 . Efficacy : To evaluate effectiveness rituximab severe refractory pediatric ITP , response define follow : platelet count great equal 50,000/mL four consecutive weekly measure begin anytime week 9 - 12 ( day 57 - day 84 ) , first fourth measure space least 22 day apart ( i.e. , establish 9 - 12 week timeframe , response would define begin first one measure ) . All measurement must independent supportive care , follow : 1 ) IVIG ( intravenous immunoglobulin ) administration within 7 day first measure time measure , 2 ) initiation 4-day corticosteroid `` pulse '' within 7 day first measure time measure , 3 ) RHo ( D ) immunoglobulin ( WinRHo-SDFTM ) administration within 7 day first measure time measure , 4 ) platelet transfusion administer within 7 day first measure time measure . 2 . Safety : To obtain safety information rituximab clinical set use Genentech standard safety monitoring SAE reporting . In addition , frequency hypogammaglobulinemia assess incidence IgG level &lt; 1/2 low limit normal age . Secondary 1 . To evaluate one-year clinical course severe refractory ITP patient treat single course rituximab . What fraction responsive patient maintain response ? 2 . To assess need salvage therapy ( supportive care ) severely affected group patient clinical trial . 3 . To evaluate rate `` early response , '' define : platelet great equal 50,000/mL least one week rescue therapy , BEFORE day 57 , continue four consecutive week . 4 . To follow trend bleeding score onset therapy duration trial . 5 . To assess incidence hypogammaglobulinemia require intervention ( IgG level &lt; 1/2 low limit normal age ) setting . IVIG 400 mg/kg monthly use treat hypogammaglobulinemia . 6 . To describe health-related quality life ( HRQL ) child severe refractory ITP , base parent report ass impact family , use standardized questionnaire . This pilot-scale objective .</detailed_description>
