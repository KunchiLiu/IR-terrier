	<brief_title>Vaccine Response After Rituximab Chronic , Severe Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose ancillary , pilot-phase study determine child history severe , chronic ITP treat rituximab might respond vaccine . Eligible patient previously currently enrol study entitle `` Open Label , Phase I/II Trial Rituximab Chronic , Severe Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Children Adolescents '' ( CHB 02-12-160 ) decide obtain trivalent , inactivate influenza vaccination . These patient invite provide one blood sample prior vaccination second sample 4-8 week vaccination quantify immune response vaccination . Additionally , patient schedule receive tetanus booster vaccination within one month influenza vaccination , response tetanus also quantify . This sample collect phlebotomy influenza sample . In case , blood sample store prior rituximab treatment use baseline assessment . The primary secondary objective study follow : Primary : - To determine portion patient respond adequately influenza vaccination , adequacy define titer great 1:32 strain virus vaccine , measure 4-8 week administration vaccine OR great four-fold increase titer measure 4-8 week administration vaccine Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate ability mount response influenza vaccine , response define increase influenza antibody titer strain virus sample 4-8 week vaccination . - To evaluate ability mount adequate response tetanus toxoid , adequacy define primary objective . - To evaluate ability mount response tetanus toxoid , response define . - To compare response influenza vaccination receive less one year rituximab great one year rituximab .</detailed_description>
