	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Denervation Patients With Drug-resistant Hypertension Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia , frequency increase age . Hemodynamic impairment thromboembolic event relate AF result significant morbidity , mortality , cost . Management patient AF involve 3 objectives—correction rhythm disturbance , rate control , prevention thromboembolism . Regardless whether rate-control rhythm-control strategy pursue , attention must also direct antithrombotic therapy prevention thromboembolism . Pharmacological cardioversion approach appear simple less efficacious . The major risk relate poor tolerance side effects，drug—associated toxicity，and proarrhythmic potentia1 antiarrhythmic drug . Radiofrequency catheter ablation AF develop rapidly recent year , number AF recurrences long-term follow-up significant . In addition , complication associate AF ablation procedure likely result prolong hospitalization , long-term disability death . Hypertension important risk factor AF , Hypertension associate leave ventricular hypertrophy , impair ventricular filling , leave atrial enlargement , slow atrial conduction velocity . These change cardiac structure physiology favor development maintenance AF , increase risk thromboembolic complication . In patient AF , aggressive treatment hypertension may reverse structural change heart , reduce thromboembolic complication , retard prevent occurrence AF . Recently , many clinical research verify Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation safely use substantially reduce blood pressure , reduce leave ventricular hypertrophy , improve glucose tolerance sleep apnea severity . Simultaneously , mark reduction muscle whole-body sympathetic-nerve activity ( MSNA ) apparent , decrease renal whole-body norepinephrine spillover . Left ventricle hypertrophy , leave atrial enlargement , high norepinephrine level，glucose tolerance abnormity obstructive sleep apnea recognize independent risk factor development recurrence AF . So , design randomize parallel control multi center clinical study demonstrate whether renal sympathetic denervation safe effective patient hypertension symptomatic atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>
