	<brief_summary>The goal proposal address serious ongoing challenge relate adherence public health recommendation know reduce risk SIDS . Adherence reach plateau unacceptably low level overall US population especially Black infant lead halt decline infant mortality widen racial disparity infant mortality . The current proposal collaborative effort capitalize extensive experience investigator study barrier adherence safe sleep practice develop two complementary , culturally competent , intervention strategy test effectiveness strategy well strategies combination . Innovative aspect Social Media Risk-reduction Training Infant Care Practices ( SMART ) study include : 1 ) unique collaboration leader field ; 2 ) leverage currently operational infant care practice study infrastructure hospital ; 3 ) use two complementary intervention potential synergistic impact ; 4 ) use social marketing strategy ; 5 ) use mobile technology ( mHealth ) deliver message ; 6 ) collaboration community resource expertise . The SMART study four arm 16 hospital randomly assign one follow study group : 1 ) Safe Sleep Nursery Education Breastfeeding mHealth messaging ; 2 ) Breastfeeding Nursery Education Safe Sleep mHealth messaging ; 3 ) Safe Sleep Nursery Education Safe Sleep mHealth messaging ; 4 ) Breastfeeding Nursery Education Breastfeeding mHealth messaging . A total 1600 mother recruit ( 100/hospital ) , 400 study group . The primary aim ass effectiveness intervention aim promote safe sleep practice compare breastfeed control intervention . The secondary aim ass potential mediating factor may explain intervention effect infant care practice may inform area future improve intervention approach . With successful completion SMART study , effectiveness data provide two intervention improve adherence safe sleep practice practical disseminate nationally multiple diverse setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FOA PAR-11-242 seek research improve design , implementation , effectiveness intervention prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS ) unintentional injury-related infant death associate sleep environment . The SMART ( Social Media Risk Reduction Training ) Infant Care Practices proposal collaborative effort among researcher collectively generate much data infant care practice underlie need FOA , access already exist operational infrastructure permit performance large randomize clinical trial study preventative intervention . This infrastructure create NICHD-funded SAFE Infant Care Practices study , mother recruit 2011 , 2012 , 2013 nationally-representative group birth hospital , completion infant care practice survey 2-5 month birth . These hospital , complete participation SAFE 2013 , geographically culturally diverse , 3 year baseline infant care practice data collect , proven track record successful recruitment . We use collective extensive experience study barrier adherence safe sleep practice develop two complementary , culturally competent intervention strategy test effectiveness strategy , well strategies combination . Both propose intervention strategy , describe , select largely used diverse population offer potential rapidly disseminate nationwide . Nursery Education : A nursery-based training program model successful pilot study inform collective research barrier adopt safe sleep practice . We use social marketing strategy capture attention nursing staff empower improve safe sleep practice model message receive mother extend family post-partum hospital stay . mHealth : We use innovative approach , use mobile messaging , applies expertise social marketing provide multiple short culturally competent video deliver via email end post-partum hospital stay 2 month age . This strategy leverage internet powerful tool access health information , mobile device ( e.g. , cell phone ) , make internet access possible many , particularly young , minority , low socioeconomic educational background . Using technology deliver health-related information likely well-accepted effective strategy , particularly among minority low-income population . Indeed , study demonstrate email may effective , inexpensive , time-efficient strategy transmit health information . For safe sleep practice intervention ( Nursery Education mHealth ) , develop control intervention Nursery Education mHealth approach use promote breastfeed . We choose breastfeed control intervention 1 ) expect impact endpoint critical assessment safe sleep practice intervention , 2 ) provide health promote message control mother . In SMART study , propose 4-arm RCT 16 hospital complete participation SAFE study randomly assign one follow group ( Safe Sleep Intervention and/or Breastfeeding Control ) : 1 ) Safe Sleep Nursery Education Breastfeeding mHealth messaging ; 2 ) Breastfeeding Nursery Education Safe Sleep mHealth messaging ; 3 ) Safe Sleep Nursery Education Safe Sleep mHealth messaging ; 4 ) Breastfeeding Nursery Education Breastfeeding mHealth messaging . We uniquely position design , implement test effectiveness intervention methodologically rigorous way propose follow specific aim : Primary Aim : To assess effectiveness intervention aim promote safe sleep practice compare breastfeeding control . Hypothesis : For recommend safe sleep practice ( supine sleep position , bed sharing , pacifier use , avoid use soft bedding ) , control variable , : ) increase adherence mother receive Safe Sleep Nursery Education ; b ) increase adherence mother receive Safe Sleep mHealth messaging ; c ) compare mother receive either Safe Sleep Nursery Education Safe Sleep mHealth message alone , increase adherence mother receive Safe Sleep Nursery Education Safe Sleep mHealth messaging . Secondary Aim : Assess potential mediating factor may explain intervention effect infant care practice may inform area future improve intervention approach . Hypothesis : Changes variable within domain Theory Planned Behavior ( Attitudes/Beliefs , Social Norms , Perceived Control ) mediator effectiveness safe sleep intervention .</detailed_description>
