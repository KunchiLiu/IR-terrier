	<detailed_description>This study base guideline fall management exercise program ( FaME ; Skelton Dinan ) . The goal : Skilling : improvement neuromuscular control , postural control strengthen large muscle group low extremity . Training Gain : improvement functional ability . Maintaining Gains : muscle growth , improvement bone density multi-sensory exercise . First , pilot study conduct untrained elderly ( `` Effects stochastic resonance therapy postural control elderly population '' ( KEK Bern : No.228/09 , Clinical Trial Registry : NCT01045746 ) . Following , second pilot study conduct frail elderly ( Application Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance Frail Elderly : The Effects Postural Control Clinical Trial Registry : NCT01543243 ) . It find select chosen form recruitment ( presentation advertisement ) measurement method suitable untrained elderly . But frail elderly choose form recruitment measurement method sufficient . For study , adapt measurement parameter balance , strength cognition use . The goal study : Evaluate effect - functional low extremity - dynamic balance - reaction time - mobility - muscle strength cognition . This one-group pre-post design study participant recruit Canton Bern - Switzerland .</detailed_description>
