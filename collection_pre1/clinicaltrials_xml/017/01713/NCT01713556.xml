	<brief_title>Treatment PTSD Reduction Traumatic Memory Reconsolidation Propranolol : Multisite Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) develop follow exposure life threaten event . One characteristic feature PTSD recurrence intrusive memory experience trauma . The persistence disturb traumatic memory PTSD often explain term trauma-induced enhancement memory encode . Several study indicate increase noradrenergic activity trauma enhance encode memory . Elevated level norepinephrine cerebrospinal fluid individual PTSD correlation elevation severity PTSD symptoms suggest increased noradrenergic activity also involve maintenance PTSD symptom . Reactivation memory retrieval also render memory labile susceptible treatment . This latter process refer memory reconsolidation . Consolidation reconsolidation occur within distinct time window follow new learn ( consolidation ) and/or retrieval ( reconsolidation ) . Even well-consolidated old fear memory undergo reconsolidation may disrupt mean pharmacological manipulation . Propranolol may effective treat PTSD long symptoms consolidate . Propranolol give reactivation memory past traumatic event reduces physiologic respond subsequent mental imagery event . HYPOTHESE : Subjects chronic PTSD receive propranolol trauma evocation subsequently show decreased PTSD symptom , compare subject receive placebo . METHOD : 56 participant chronic PTSD recruit participation . On Week 1 , subject complete standardized measure PTSD symptom . Next , 90 minute administration study medication ( either propranolol placebo ) , participant undergo script preparation procedure , disclose detail traumatic event . Scripts portray event prepared subsequent replay . On Week 2 , administration study medication ( either propranolol placebo ) , participant ask ( read script ) engage script-driven mental imagery traumatic event . Following procedure , PTSD symptom assess . The procedure repeat Weeks 3 , 4 , 5 6 . On Weeks 7 18 , standardize measure PTSD symptom repeat .</detailed_description>
