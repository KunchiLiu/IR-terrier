	<brief_summary>This study intend investigate clinical outcome new immunoenhancing formula compose arginine free compare isonitrogenous , isocaloric standard formula ICU patients.The study design multicenter , double-blind randomize control study 3 period Screening , Run-in Randomization period . Primary Objective : To evaluate clinical outcome immunoenhancing diet ( IED ) arginine free medical-surgical ICU patient . Secondary Objective : To evaluate immunologic effect safety IED arginine free formula .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It accept nutrition support essential treatment critically ill patient . It also reasonable initiate nutrition support therapy soon possible . Although malnutrition frequently associate risk immune dysfunction , affect organ system . Thus , ICU patient need immunonutrients supplementation . An additional strategy maximize benefit consider use product supplement specific nutrient modulate immune system , improve wound healing , reduce oxidative stress . The low incidence infectious complication may follow short length intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospital stay . Many study concentrate nutrient stimulate function cellular immunity patient . These nutrient include arginine , glutamine omega-3 fatty acid direct effect T lymphocytes macrophage . Enteral formula design immune-enhancing diet ( IED ) contain supplemental amount L-arginine , L-glutamine , nucleotide long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid : eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) arachidonic acid ( ARA ) addition nutrient substrates essential general nutrition metabolism . These formula vary considerably composition four primary substrate . They introduce immune cell function augmentation , inflammation regulation infection minimization . Glutamine , conditional-essential amino acid , essential energy source , precursor protein synthesis donate nitrogen synthesis purine , pyrimidine , nucleotide , amino sugar , glutathione antioxidant . Glutamine also play important role enhance immune cell function elevation proinflammatory cytokine production . The low level glutamine associate impaired tissue healing , immune dysfunction increase mortality . Omega-3 fatty acid ( n-3 fatty acid omega-3 fatty acid ) directly affect function monocyte membrane characteristic alteration , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) synthesis action macrophage phagocytosis , IL-1 superoxide synthesis . Moreover , omega-3 fatty acid reduces cellular immune response reaction compete arachidonic acid result less inflammation . Arginine consider nutrient enhances immune response . Studies show arginine-supplemented immune formula help decrease protein catabolism , improve nitrogen balance , enhance wound heal wound strength result less infection short hospitalization day . Arginine also show support immune system enhance lymphocyte proliferation phagocytosis . Arginine may provide benefit . However , recent meta-analysis conduct subgroup critically ill patient Heyland colleague reveal arginine may harmful group especially septic patient stimulate nitric oxide ( NO ) production . Based scientific rationale , recommend arginine use critically ill patient clearly septic . And many evidence exist supplementation antioxidant immunonutrition critically ill. Glutamine fish oil/borage oil consider . These result development immune-enhancing diet ( IED ) without arginine . In addition , two type lipid add formula modulate immune response . First , fish oil source omega-3 fatty acid borage oil source docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) , unique omega-6 fatty acid ( n-6 fatty acid ) . Both n-3 n-6 fatty acid polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) essential fatty acid ( EFA ) . Therefore , immune-enhancing diet composes L-glutamine , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) , antioxidant vitamin trace mineral vitamin A , vitamin E , vitamin C , selenium betacarotene .</detailed_description>
