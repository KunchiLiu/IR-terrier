	<brief_summary>Bone loss well-documented effect spaceflight astronaut , also condition affect million men woman Earth year . Many countermeasure bone loss propose , many evaluate degree . To date , show potential focus either exercise pharmacological intervention , none target dietary intake alone factor predict minimize bone loss spaceflight . The investigator propose document ratio acid precursor base precursor diet related directional change marker bone resorption formation flight recovery flight . There high likelihood success predict extent bone loss dietary intake pattern astronaut spaceflight , give concept strongly anchor data obtain ground-based experiment laboratory others . The notion manipulate diet minimize bone loss could also significant social economic impact NASA general public - especially give increase trend diet high animal protein low fruit vegetable . The result propose experiment lead development dietary countermeasure bone loss consist balance diet associated risk side effect might present pharmaceutical supplement , requirement payload mass , additional crew time necessary flight .</brief_summary>
