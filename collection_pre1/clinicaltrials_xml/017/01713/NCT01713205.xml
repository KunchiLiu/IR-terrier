	<brief_title>Prediction Study Complications After Severe Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma major public health problem worldwide , rank fourth lead cause death . One serious complication major trauma sepsis , often induce sequential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) . There still specific biomarkers predict susceptibility complication outcomes , lead limited prevention method high mortality rate severe trauma patient . Previous study group find sepsis MODS predictor , include genetic polymorphism , serum cytokine cell-surface marker . The purpose multi-center observational study select biomarkers evaluate clinically economically effective diagnostic algorithm prediction complication severe trauma patient .</detailed_description>
