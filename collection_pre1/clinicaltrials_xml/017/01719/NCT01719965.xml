	<detailed_description>1 . Background Research Thai-Myanmar border Since 1986 , Shoklo Malaria Research Unit ( SMRU ) provide basic healthcare carry research aim reduce impact multi-drug resistant malaria infectious disease area border Thailand Myanmar . SMRU 's main area interest malaria , special interest child pregnant woman - group risk malaria - combine research operation antenatal clinic along border . SMRU currently run multiple free clinic Karen Burman border population would otherwise lack access health care . The distant clinic 120 km SMRU office Mae Sot . Carrying research provide care along border present range unique practical ethical challenge . This part people live near border mostly migrants refugee elsewhere Myanmar , since 1980s , move border area escape economic hardship sometimes conflict persecution . There currently think two million migrant Myanmar living Thailand ( 150 000 refugee camp ) million 'internally displace ' people live near border inside Myanmar , although number difficult verify . The vast majority people , come diverse range different ethnic , religious , political language group , live insecure , unsafe condition face number serious health difficulty . Until 1995 , SMRU focus activity primarily refugee camp border area strong collaboration establish non-govermental organisation ( NGOs ) control malaria refugee population operation `` Malaria Task Force '' ( MTF ) . This largely successful malaria minor problem within camp . As consequence , whilst SMRU remain responsible antenatal obstetric care treatment malaria patient refugee camp Mae La , since 1995 increasingly extended activity reach wider displace population little alternative access malaria diagnosis treatment antenatal care . This do collaboration Thai Ministry Public Health ( MOPH ) close collaboration district hospital Tak provincial health authority . In 2001-2003 Tak Malaria Initiative , support Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation deploy malaria control strategy develop SMRU refugee camp 200 affect village province 's border district substantial success . When fund Gates Foundation come end , MOPH take program . The border Thailand Myanmar forefront global fight malaria frontline battle development spread resistance anti-malarial drug . Malaria parasites find drug-resistant earth expansion spread real global threat ( research already demonstrate drug-resistant malaria parasite find Africa originate South East Asia ) . This particularly urgent important population live along border publish evidence malaria parasite may become tolerant even advance artemisinin combination therapy ( ACTs ) forefront global malaria treatment . Rationale establishment community advisory board There widespread agreement need community engagement clinical research , particularly research involve minority group vulnerable population . However little research effectiveness challenge associate different form engagement , little evidence base base engagement strategy . A popular form community engagement researcher interact Community Advisory Board . The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit work Thai-Burmese border many year informally engage community healthcare research initiative , especially area ethic consent . In January 2009 , community engagement formalise establishment Tak Province Border Community Ethics Advisory Board ( T-CAB ) . The T-CAB first kind investigator come across set similar nature involve mobile unstable population reside along porous border . At time establishment , T-CAB three main goal . The first , period train - disease malaria nature goal research - 's member would able advise whether study acceptable perceive beneficial , community region . The second , T-CAB would play key role advise researcher ethical operational aspect propose study : inform consent procedure , fair compensation , risk benefit , protect confidentiality research subject , . The third , aim T-CAB would act 'bridge ' community researcher . It would one hand , provide community opportunity express view propose research influence direct research aim , , provide mean researcher might feedback result research community . Three year , SMRU question T-CAB `` successful '' current T-CAB model best model community . In order evaluate T-CAB , first evaluation tool develop off-the-shelf evaluation tool CABs , evaluation carry .</detailed_description>
