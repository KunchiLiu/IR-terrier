	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular event lead non-cancer cause mortality childhood cancer , occur significantly young age general population . The increased incidence cardiovascular event adversely impact functional capacity , morbidity , mortality otherwise relatively healthy 20 40 year old individual . Moreover , understand mechanisms cancer treatment could influence occurrence latent cardiovascular event unavailable . Our group others establish independent , noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure cardiovascular risk middle age elderly individual . Cardiovascular risk include , acute coronary syndrome , cardiac death , congestive heart failure . The goal application show childhood cancer survivor risk impaired cardiovascular cerebrovascular health increase aortic stiffness , compare healthy adolescent young adult age mate . Studies design determine MRI measure cardiovascular function differ adolescent/adult childhood cancer survivor ( n=60 ) , age match control ( n=30 ) , adolescents/young adult plan treatment chemo- radiation therapy ( n=25 ) . The investigator propose MRI marker responsible cardiovascular event represent new clinical indicator could target treat asymptomatic cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
