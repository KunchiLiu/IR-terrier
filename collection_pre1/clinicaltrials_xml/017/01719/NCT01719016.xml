	<detailed_description>Diagnosis relative contribution large artery blockage microvascular blockage much need treatment coronary artery disease . In order achieve , two novel parameter , pressure drop coefficient ( CDP ) , combine flow pressure reading Lesion flow coefficient ( LFC ) , combine anatomical detail lesion pressure flow reading , investigate . The diagnostic parameter correlate Coronary Flow Reserve ( CFR ) value obtain use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image . They also correlate Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR ) .</detailed_description>
