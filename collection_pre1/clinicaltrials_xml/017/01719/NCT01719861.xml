	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) small cell lung cancer high-grade neuroendocrine tumor patient treatment desipramine . Secondary Objectives : - To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . - To perform exploratory blood biomarker analysis PCSK1 ROBO1 patient enrol trial . - To measure safety desipramine use type , frequency severity adverse event reaction report accord CTCAE v4.0 - To measure tolerability use incidence adverse event ( AEs ) lead desipramine delay discontinuation - To establish MTD desipramine patient adhere intrapatient dose escalation schema - To measure serum desipramine level treatment</detailed_description>
