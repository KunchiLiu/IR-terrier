	<brief_title>Study ENMD-2076 Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ENMD-2076 oral drug work block certain enzyme call Aurora A working . These enzyme need cell divide include cancer cell . ENMD-2076 also work stop growth new blood vessel would provide tumor nutrient grow . It believe block Aurora A enzymes work stop new blood vessel grow , tumor may stop grow shrink .</detailed_description>
