	<brief_title>Open-Trial EPI-743 Adults With Tourette Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tourette syndrome ( TS ) childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterize multiple motor vocal tic last least year duration . Currently , exist several effective pharmacological treatment childhood tic include alpha-2 agonist medication ( guanfacine clonidine ) neuroleptic ( antipsychotic ) medication . These medication , however , significant side-effects partially effective treat tic . EPI-743 orally absorb small molecule readily cross central nervous system . It work target enzyme NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( NQO1 ) . Its mode action synchronize energy generation mitochondrion need counter cellular redox stress . EPI-743 recently receive orphan drug status U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The FDA allow Expanded Access program provide EPI-743 seriously ill patient diagnose inherited respiratory chain disease mitochondria . The rationale use agent indirect . Over past 10 year , defect mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) implicate wide variety neurodegenerative neuromuscular disease . One neurological symptom definitely associate OXPHOS movement disorder dystonia . A specific missense mutation mtDNA complex I ( NADH dehydrogenase ) gene , MTND6 , link maternally inherit dystonia along companion phenotype , Leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy . In addition , mitochondrial disease also associate movement disorder include Friedreich 's ataxia ( ataxia ) Leigh 's disease ( loss head control motor skill ) . EPI-743 effective treating child adults disease . Over time , many TS patient develop complex motor tic , sudden , purposive appearing , stereotype movement variable duration . Examples myriad include facial gesture movement brush hair back , possibly combination head jerk , body shrug . Gyrating , bending , twist movement head torso also see . These slow twisting movement usually refer dystonic tic . A second line evidence concern potential therapeutic value N-acetyl-cysteine ( NAC ) treatment neuropsychiatric condition closely related TS include Trichotillomania ( TTM ) Obsessive-compulsive disorder [ OCD ] . Recent double-blind , placebo-controlled study NAC provide evidence efficacy reduce symptom trichotillomania ( TTM ) adult [ 49 ] . The effect size 12-week study strikingly large ( = 1.3 ) . Trichotillomania , like TS , consider obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder . Individuals TTM experience urge prior hairpulling , similar urge TS . Case report also suggest potential efficacy NAC treat OCD . NAC hypothesize two possible mechanism action . NAC convert cystine , substrate glutamate/cystine antiporter locate glial cell . The uptake cystine glia cause release glutamate extrasynaptic space , stimulate inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptor glutamatergic nerve terminal thereby reduce synaptic release glutamate . NAC also precursor glutathione , major antioxidant brain . Through mechanism NAC hypothesize improve OXPHOS . One effect EPI-743 's activity NQO1 restoration cellular glutathione store . A third line indirect evidence postmortem brain study , two class interneurons reduce number basal ganglia `` high energy '' consume cell , i.e. , GABAergic , fast spike internerons cholinergic tonically active interneurons . Given high energy demand associate cell perhaps loss partially due defect OXPHOS . A fourth line indirect evidence EPI-743 effective treat mitochrondrial disease , brain region low HMPAO uptake show mark increase uptake . In case TS ( 50 case 20 control ) HMPAO uptake find reduce left caudate , anterior cingulate cortex leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Severity tic related hypoperfusion leave caudate cingulate leave medial temporal region .</detailed_description>
