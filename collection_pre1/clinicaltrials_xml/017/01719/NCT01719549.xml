	<criteria>Pathologically prove metastatic unresectable adenocarcinoma stomach gastroesophageal junction Patients progressive disease ( radiological confirmation require ) one two line chemotherapy palliative setting advance gastric cancer . Adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy count one line prior chemotherapy . FGFR2 amplification ( copy number &gt; 3 , identify real time PCR use TaqMan probe ) prescreening screening procedure . Prescreening performed Real Time PCR FGFR2 amplification time prior chemotherapy . At least 18 patient 6 copy number FGFR2 ( see Statistical Methods Data Analysis ) . Presence least one measurable disease ( coprimary endpoint overall response rate patient FGFR2 copy number &gt; 6 ) one evaluable disease ( coprimary endpoint PFS patient FGFR2 copy number &gt; 3 ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 Age 18 year old Expected life expectancy 3 month ECOG performance status 0~2 Resolution toxic effect prior treatment grade 0 1 NCICTCAE version 4.0 Adequate bone marrow , hepatic , renal , organ function ( Neutrophil &gt; 1,500/mm3 , Platelet &gt; 75,000/mm3 , Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL , Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST/ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULM case liver metastasis ) , Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN , Amylase , lipase &lt; ULN , Electrolytes within normal limits. , Urine dipstick reading : Negative proteinuria , documentation +1 result protein dipstick reading , total urinary protein 500 mg measure creatinine clearance 50 mL/min/1.73m2 24hour urine collection ) Women reproductive potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ; men woman reproductive potential must practice effective method avoid pregnancy receive study drug . Washout period previous chemotherapy 4 time half life least 2 week completion prior chemotherapy whichever come first No prior FGF/FGFR inhibitor No prior radiation therapy within 2 week study ( Irradiated lesion include evaluable lesion . ) Written inform consent Past concurrent history neoplasm gastric adenocarcinoma , except curatively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer situ carcinoma cervix uteri Bowel obstruction Evidence serious gastrointestinal bleeding Women childbearing potential pregnant breast feeding adult reproductive potential employ effective method birth control . Barrier contraceptives must use throughout trial sex . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Women childbearing potential , define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) , must negative serum pregnancy test 72 hour prior start TKI258 . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association , Class III IV ) impair cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include one following : ( LVEF &lt; 45 % determine MUGA scan echocardiogram , Complete leave bundle branch block , Obligate use cardiac pacemaker , Congenital long QT syndrome , History presence ventricular tachyarrhythmia , Presence unstable atrial fibrillation ( ventricular response &gt; 100 bpm ) . Patients stable atrial fibrillation eligible , provide meet cardiac exclusion criterion , Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 bpm ) , Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 100 mmHg , without antihypertensive medication ) . , QTc &gt; 480 msec screen ECG , Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( Bifascicular block ) , Angina pectoris 3 month prior start study drug , Acute Myocardial Infarction 3 month prior start study drug , Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , Congestive heart failure , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) ) Uncontrolled infection Diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent independent disease , require chronic medication ) sign clinically significant peripheral vascular disease . Previous pericarditis ; clinically significant pleural effusion previous 12 month current ascites require two interventions/month . Known preexist clinically significant disorder hypothalamicpituitary axis , adrenal thyroid gland . Prior acute chronic pancreatitis etiology . Acute chronic liver disease chronic liver impairment . Malabsorption syndrome uncontrolled gastrointestinal toxicity ( nausea , diarrhea , vomit ) toxicity great NCI CTCAE grade 2 . Other severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate study . Treatment medication potential risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Points treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . Use ketoconazole , erythromycin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , rifampin , phenytoin quinidine 2 week prior baseline . Major surgery 28 day prior start study drug recover side effect therapy . Known diagnosis HIV infection ( HIV test mandatory ) . Patients brain metastasis assess radiologic imaging ( e.g . CT , MRI ) Alcohol substance abuse disorder</criteria>
