	<brief_title>Buparlisib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical benefit rate ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] standard disease [ SD ] &gt; = 6 month ) BKM120 ( buparlisib ) patient relapse refractory lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate , overall survival , progression-free survival duration response . II . To describe toxicity associate BKM120 lymphoma . III . To evaluate prognostic factor aggressive lymphoma whether 's correlation clinical benefit . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess serum cytokine BKM120 therapy . II . To assess phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway member expression paraffin-embedded tumor sample pre-treatment . III . To assess paired fresh tumor tissue obtain consent patient pre- post-therapy change activation PI3K pathway member . OUTLINE : Patients receive buparlisib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
