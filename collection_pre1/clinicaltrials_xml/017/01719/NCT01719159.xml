	<brief_title>Intrathecal Therapy With Monoclonal Antibodies Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There presently efficient therapy available progressive MS , especially clear evidence active inflammatory lesion exacerbation part disease . There , however , evidence treatment protocol use cytotoxic drug may extent slow progressive course . One specific feature long-standing MS inflammatory cell accumulate central nervous system ( CNS ) compartment subarachnoid perivascular space may therefore hard reach via standard drug delivery systemic administration . Administration substances via Intrathecal ( IT ) route , however , show efficiently distribute subarachnoid space may therefore attractive route drug delivery</detailed_description>
