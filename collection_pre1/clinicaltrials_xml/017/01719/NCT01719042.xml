	<detailed_description>As part study , investigator review medical record sure patient meet require criterion healthy enough take part study . The study consist five separate visit Clinical research Center University Florida visit last anywhere 6-8 hour . Patients give diary questionnaire record take medication side effect might . Patients also Electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) make sure healthy enough participant study measure effect medication heart . During study , patient continue treatment Mycobacterium avium Complex infection . Patients observe take medication five separate day . On day patient blood draw 2 6 hour drug take order measure drug level blood . We also use blood measure level proteins hormone make sure medication affect patient 's heart . The patient fill several questionnaire dietary assessment online . Investigators assess patient 's body make-up use device call Bod Pod . The patient also assign one two treatment group : ( 1 ) Ondansetron 8mg ( Zofran® , GlaxoSmithKline , Research Triangle Park , NC ) every morning breakfast versus ( 2 ) dietary supplement prior take daily medication . The patient assign first treatment group period two week . On third study visit investigator switch patient second group . Although incidence tuberculosis decrease United States last decade , incidence chronic pulmonary infection nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) appear increase . Unfortunately , common problem management infection inability elderly patient tolerate currently recommend multidrug regimen ( 1 ) azithromycin clarithromycin , ( 2 ) rifampin rifabutin , ( 3 ) ethambutol . The frequent adverse reaction MAC treatment gastrointestinal ( GI ) , commonly associate macrolides rifampin . Although macrolide toxicity generally dose-related , role routine monitoring drug concentration subsequent dose adjustment study . The role anti-emetics dietary supplement mitigate symptom also define .</detailed_description>
