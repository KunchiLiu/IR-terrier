	<brief_summary>Asthma disease characterize inflammation airway . The body naturally make compound reduce inflammation . Unfortunately , patient severe asthma , pathway compound use reduce inflammation seem perturb . Investigators choose focus anti-inflammatory compound call lipoxins work `` ALX Axis '' , name give ALX receptor pathway ligand . Work Brigham Women 's Hospital suggest patient severe asthma , ALX axis may work properly therefore may shut inflammation expect . Also , information suggest case , steroid ( prednisone similar drug ) , commonly use treat asthma , may affect ALX axis negative way , paradoxically make inflammation bad instead well . As part NIH Severe Asthma Research Program Asthma Research Center 's goal identify cause problem ALX axis severe asthma . To , participant severe asthma compare participant milder form asthma . Investigators use sample take directly lungs people asthma , well blood , urine CT scan lung well understand ALX axis change corticosteroid treatment throughout three year span . Participants come Asthma Research Center procedures do . Investigators expect participant perform breathe test complete questionnaire diary . To good understand corticosteroid negatively affect ALX axis severe asthma , researcher take sample one time steroid injection equivalent prednisone treatment asthma . Participants perform two bronchoscopy procedure , corticosteroid treatment , biopsy cell obtain participant 's lung . Investigators use sample observe change corticosteroid may ALX axis . At end study , researcher Brigham Women 's Hospital expect understand ALX axis way allow formulate new therapy drug target treat people asthma , especially severe asthma , effectively . In Boston , study run together Asthma Research Center Brigham Women 's Hospital ( adult ) Boston Children 's Hospital ( child ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe asthma account majority morbidity mortality relate asthma . It characterize persistent airway inflammation despite anti-inflammatory therapy , persistent airway hyperresponsiveness , `` remodel '' airway include fibrosis . Lipoxin A4 ( LXA4 ) 15-epimer-LXA4 lipid-derived mediator show promote anti-inflammatory pro-resolving cellular response effect ALX/FPR2 receptor . They promote resolution inflammation , inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness , counteract pro-fibrotic process . Investigators Brigham Women 's Hospital others show ALX effector pathway constituent ligand ( ALX axis ) perturb severe asthma ( SA ) compare non-severe asthma ( NSA ) . Specifically , SA LXA4 production decrease ALX/FPR2 receptor expression reduce . Further , investigator Brigham Women 's Hospital show low level lipoxins , relative pro phlogistic leukotrienes , associate reduce airway function ( FEV1 ) . Considering data function ALX axis , appear perturbation constituent axis could identify , perhaps underlie , several process characterize severe , progressive asthma . Further point , work progress do Brigham Women 's Hospital indicate corticosteroid ( CS ) interaction ALX axis may underlie perturbation . CS decrease production LXA4 . More importantly , CS increase production pro-resolving annexin A1 , also appear promote pro-inflammatory signal ALX/FPR2 via upregulation serum amyloid A ( SAA ) . SAA express lung associate exacerbation COPD . Hypotheses : Peripheral blood leukocyte bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtain SA NSA subject intramuscular triamcinolone baseline test hypothesis vivo corticosteroid reduce pro-inflammatory cellular response enhance LXA4-mediated anti-inflammatory response majority asthmatic subject . There sub-group individual severe asthma vivo corticosteroid paradoxically increase pro-inflammatory response . Investigators also test hypothesis paradoxical signal overcome lipoxins . In addition , investigator test hypothesis basal p anti-inflammatory response dampen severe asthma . Investigators Brigham Women 's Hospital hypothesize cohort severe asthmatic subject impair counter-regulatory signal specific ALX axis phenotype predispose increase inflammation , asthma exacerbation disease progression . Investigators test hypothesis vivo corticosteroid increase ( may decrease ) LXA4 15-epi-LXA4 increase annexin A1 serum amyloid A level compound post-CS differ disease severity , remain stable 3 year interval . Samples obtain study entry intramuscular triamcinolone test hypothesis vivo corticosteroid increase ALX/FPR2 expression leukocytes airway cell .</detailed_description>
