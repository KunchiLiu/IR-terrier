	<brief_summary>This study two purpose . One determine daily sulindac decrease breast density ; risk factor breast cancer development . The second determine whether sulindac reduces pain stiffness associate regular use aromatase inhibitor give treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To accomplish study aim , conduct non-randomized phase II trial AI alone anastrozole combination sulindac postmenopausal woman early stage ER+ breast cancer receive anastrozole adjuvant hormonal therapy . Recruitment limit woman anastrozole reduce heterogeneity introduce AIs . Anastrozole select AI available generic form currently comprise almost 100 % patient population . Approximately 100 breast cancer patient , stable AI therapy ( minimum 3 month ) treatment breast cancer receive sulindac 150 mg bid 12 month . Breast imaging conduct baseline , 3 , 9 15 month . A one-month run-in period follow 3-month observation , agent period use identify subject likely adhere study regimen determine extent variability breast density time . The primary endpoint study change appearance contralateral , uninvolved breast measure quantitative Fat Water Ratio ( FWR-MRI ) map 12 month response either control ( anastrozole alone ) experimental ( anastrozole + sulindac ) therapy . As change breast density contralateral , uninvolved breast primary endpoint study , patient bilateral breast cancer patient undergo bilateral mastectomy reconstruction surgery ineligible . Secondary endpoint trial include 12 month change arm diffusion weight MRI ( median ADC value ) general pain joint specific stiffness pain assess BPI-SF . A number exploratory endpoint plan include comparison MRI measure breast , tissue biomarkers , pain 6 month early indicator 12 month response . For tissue biomarkers , core needle biopsy obtain subset woman consent procedure uninvolved contralateral breast baseline 6 month . This anticipated ~75 % baseline ( n=100 ) ( provide tissue sample cross sectional comparative analysis MRI feature baseline ) ~25 % 6 month follow-up visit ( n=37 ) ( provide tissue conduct analyse biomarker response intervention ) . Tissue study include characterization tissue histology ( graded cellularity stromal element ) molecular measure proliferation apoptosis .</detailed_description>
