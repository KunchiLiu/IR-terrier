	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . It also mean FDA yet approve ponatinib use patient , include people type cancer . In order participate study , must first determine whether patient 's lung head neck squamous cell cancer ( SCC ) alteration FGFR kinase make experimental test squamous cell cancer tissue sample . This experimental test `` genetic test '' `` genotyping test '' , method use study tumor 's gene . The result research purpose consider `` genetic testing '' purpose diagnose medical condition . Cancers develop result change occur human genetic material ( DNA ) ; change call mutation alteration . This experimental test give information gene normal cell patient 's body , help identify abnormal gene ( like FGFR kinase mutation alteration ) usually find cancer cell . We use experimental test determine whether tumor contains require alteration/mutation thus may respond ponatinib . Ponatinib investigational , oral anti-cancer drug design inhibit abnormal protein find cancer cell may cause cancer cell die . In laboratory testing , ponatinib show inhibit family protein call FGFR kinase , genetic alteration/mutation find squamous cell lung cancer . There laboratory evidence alterations/mutations FGFR kinases squamous cell lung cancer may drive growth tumor inhibit FGFR kinase ponatinib may decrease stop growth lung SCC . In research study , look see study drug , ponatinib , keep cancer grow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn individual take part research study . If patient test procedure recently , may may repeat . These screen test include : medical history , physical examination , vital sign , performance status , assessment tumor ( ) , CT scan MRI scan brain , routine blood test , urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential electrocardiogram . Additionally time screen patient undergo collection archival tumor tissue sample tumor mutation test . If patient take part research study , give study drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 4 week time patient take study drug mouth daily . The number cycle patient receive depend patient tolerate ponatinib cancer worsen . There possibility follow test procedure may need do time list . These may do research doctor determine medically necessary monitor illness side effect patient may experience . It important patient call research doctor time experience side effect tolerate . During cycle patient physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication might take . If patient 's disease progress study , give option consent new biopsy research purpose financial cost patient . The investigator would like keep track medical condition rest patient 's life . The investigator would like call every six month see patient . Keeping touch check condition help investigator look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
