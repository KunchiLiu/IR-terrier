	<brief_summary>Bronchiectasis chronic disease arises progressive airway inflammation infection . It postulate bacterial infection trigger intense airway inflammation lead acute exacerbation bronchiectasis . Antibiotics potent medication treatment bronchiectasis , however , sputum bacterial load inflammatory index steady-state exacerbation remain largely unknown . The investigation might shed light role antibiotic play acute exacerbation bronchiectasis uncover mechanism subgroup individual respond satisfactorily .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis chronic disease arises progressive airway inflammation infection . Pro-inflammatory mediator , product activate neutrophil recruit inflamed site , release bronchiectatic airway mediate cascade neutrophil infiltration . This suggest bacterial infection play pivotal role neutrophil-derived inflammation lead vicious cycle perpetuate development airway destruction might result acute exacerbation . Treatments target bacterial infection therefore necessary , particularly acute exacerbation bronchiectasis . Although short- long-term administration antibiotic evidence markedly suppress bacterial colonization inflammatory index , role potent antibiotic play patient exacerbation bronchiectasis unclear . The assessment bacterial infection sputum systemic inflammation steady-state , acute exacerbation recovery exacerbation bronchiectasis may clinically shed light indicate efficacy antibiotic treatment . Furthermore , subgroup patient may experience acute exacerbation may stem non-bacterial pathogen . There dire need compare change sputum bacterial load inflammatory index base sputum bacteriology . This may help uncover mechanism different response antibiotic treatment patient vary bacteriologic profile . Unlike assessment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , clinical index appraisal onset exacerbation efficacy treatment available . Of , 24-hour sputum volume , microbial clearance , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire validate . In present study , employ sputum bacteriology inflammatory index , include aforementioned parameter , assessment .</detailed_description>
