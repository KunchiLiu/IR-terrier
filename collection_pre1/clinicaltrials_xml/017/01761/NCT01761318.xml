	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Type 2 diabetes mellitus endemic disease associate obesity sedentary lifestyle . In year 2025 prevalence DM2 patient worldwide expect 334 million . In year 2000 estimate 2,9 million diabetes-related death worldwide . Especially cardiovascular disease contribute great deal high mortality rate . Diabetes patient two-fold excess risk wide range vascular disease , independently risk factor , make cardiovascular disease lead cause death diabetes patient . Therefore , treatment DM2 focus prevention cardiovascular disease diabetes related complication retinopathy , neuropathy nephropathy . Unfortunately , despite lifestyle advises , glucose lower therapy co-treatment risk factor hypertension dyslipidemia , complication rate remain high . Classical glucose lower treatment strategy sulfonylurea derivative insulin ultimately control disease , partly participate vicious cycle increase body weight insulin resistance . A hopeful new therapeutic agent Glucagon Like Peptide -1 analogue Liraglutide . Next glucose lower effect , reduce body weight result increased insulin sensitivity . The group GLP-1 analogues therefore widely prescribe nowadays . However , effect cardiovascular system investigate yet . Since cardiovascular disease major threat DM2 patient , effect new drug cardiovascular system important issue . Interestingly , cardio-protective effect Liraglutide expect basis associate weight loss direct protective effect heart . The investigator hypothesize treatment Liraglutide improve cardiac function DM2 patient . The pathogenesis cardiovascular disease DM2 rather complex multifactorial . Ultimately patient develop myocardial infarction / heart failure . Often DM2 patient already subclinical sign cardiac dysfunction DM2 recognize , main early sign diastolic dysfunction . Diastolic dysfunction strong predictor mortality . The subclinical characteristic cardiac dysfunction highly associate condition call metabolic syndrome . The metabolic syndrome consist existence three five follow risk factor : 1. elevate waist circumference ; 2. elevate triglyceride ; 3. reduce HDL-C ; 4. elevate blood pressure ; 5. elevate fast blood glucose include diabetic-range elevate blood glucose level . With criteria patient diabetes meet criterion metabolic syndrome . A key element pathogenesis metabolic syndrome might ectopic fat deposition ; early sign syndrome visceral adiposity . Next visceral adiposity , significant deposition ectopic fat store liver , heart , skeletal muscle kidney . Triglyceride accumulation cardiomyocyte call myocardial steatosis . Studies perform group proven caloric restriction result reduction myocardial steatosis improvement diastolic function . Hence , myocardial steatosis associate cardiac dysfunction seem reversible case hepatic steatosis . The putative mechanism steatosis result cardiac dysfunction think explain phenomenon call lipotoxicity . Altered substrate metabolism insulin resistance cardiomyocytes may also play important role pathogenesis cardiac dysfunction obesity DM2 . Systemic cardiac insulin resistance proven associate increased production toxic lipid diacylglycerol ceramide . The ultimate treatment obesity diabetes related cardiac disease seem weight loss . However , lifestyle intervention program repeatedly unsuccessful sustain long term effect . Liraglutide characterized long-acting , human GLP-1 analogue show 97 % homology amino acid sequence human GLP-1 . The phase 3a program Liraglutide encompass five clinical trial Liraglutide treatment study stage treatment cascade type 2 diabetes mellitus . In five study , Liraglutide compare directly standard treatment . The phase 3a clinical development program , include 3,978 exposed patient DM2 , investigate efficacy tolerability Liraglutide 1.2 1.8 mg daily ( n = 2735 ) monotherapy combination various oral antidiabetic drug . The phase 3a study show HBA1C reduction 1-1.5 % fast plasma glucose reduction 0,83 - 2,39 mmol/L . In addition , weight reduction consistent : Liraglutide 1.8 mg monotherapy accompany mean weight loss 2.5 kg 52-week period . A substudy two phase 3a trial show weight loss cause Liraglutide , predominantly cause reduction fat mass ; visceral fat compartment reduce 16 % baseline 26 week Liraglutide 1,2 mg daily . Recent experimental data suggest GLP-1 analogue direct effect heart . In study rat heart , size infarct diminish 50 % infusion GLP-1 . Post condition efficacy GLP-1 also demonstrate ex vivo rat heart . Exendin-4 show diminish infarct size approximately 56 % 39 % , respectively , rat global pig focal model heart ischemia . The GLP-1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) present cardiomyocytes well endothelium smooth muscle cell myocardial vasculature . The cell death effector mechanism target GLP-1R appear mitochondrial permeability transition apoptosis . Animal study suggest myocardial contractility improvement GLP-1 administration . For instance , dog dilate cardiomyopathy treat GLP-1 48 h show strong improvement myocardial contractility cardiac output . GLP-1 infusion associate increase myocardial glucose uptake , suggest ameliorate insulin sensitivity cardiomyocytes . In small clinical study , GLP-1 infuse patient PCI approximately 72 h patient select elective coronary artery bypass graft 12 h 48 h surgery . The latter group show improve metabolic profile hemodynamic change . In contrast , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) increase 29 % 39 % find former study , well study 12 diabetic , overweight heart failure patient ( New York Heart Association class III/IV , LVEF ≤ 40 % ) , give GLP-1 infusion 5 week : end treatment , patient show increased LVEF , cardiac output , improve score life quality questionnaire . A number laboratory study suggest vasorelaxant effect GLP-1 . No pressor effect find associate GLP-1 treatment study diabetic patient . In fact , decrease systolic diastolic blood pressure value note DM2 patient 82-week exenatide trial [ 33 ] , manner correlate weight loss . Recent experiment ( unpublished data ) show GLP-1 analogue exendin - 4 protect atherosclerosis non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) APOE 3 - Leiden.CETP mouse western diet probably due decrease hepatic CETP expression well reduce monocyte recruitment circulation vessel wall . In addition , hepatic steatosis improve GLP-1 receptor agonist mouse . So far , dedicated clinical study perform systematically study effect GLP-1 analogue cardiovascular function . Given consistency result animal experiment clinical observation , area appear ripe clinical study . Beneficial effect cardiovascular endpoint crucial consolidate therapeutic profile Liraglutide . Although large scale study cardiovascular endpoint underway , attractive option perform small scale , short-term study advance cardiovascular imaging technique . Thereby gain insight way GLP-1 therapy affect cardiovascular system . Advanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance image spectroscopy ( MRI/S ) enable assess effect intervention , relatively small group patient limited period time . As cardiovascular parameter strong clinically relevant predictor cardiovascular event , measurement parameter MRI/S worthwhile . Our research group develop advance cardiovascular MRI MRS technique algorithms gain extended experience field DM2 related cardiac function lipid metabolism . 2 . RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING PROCEDURE OF STUDY POPULATION Patients recruit outpatient clinic Leiden University Medical Center , general practitioner , local hospital advertisement . Patients physicists ask point eligible patient opportunity study participation . If interested , patient inform principal investigator . Patients give oral write explanation study . After consideration time two week , patient ask give write acknowledgement inform consent participate . Then medical screen take place . Screening perform overnight fast least 12 hour . The screen consist medical history , physical examination consist measurement height , body weight , heart rate , blood pressure examination thorax abdomen . Furthermore laboratory test rest-ECG perform . If patient eligible- willing participate study , sign informed consent , patient include . Informed consent must obtain trial related activity take place . After inclusion study protocol , patient 's treat physician general practitioner notify . Although patient free leave study time , attempt recruit patient likely continue study completion . 3 . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Because absence data effect GLP-1 DM2 patient without heart failure , hard calculate sample size need detect difference myocardial function 26 week active treatment control . Clinically relevant difference standard deviation two study choose generate data sample size calculation . The data use incorporate precision MRI assessment cardiac function generate study perform group pioglitazone v metformin cardiac function parameter . To estimate effect GLP-1 therapy cardiac function , data pilot study eight DM2 patient heart failure . Calculations diastolic function parameter base `` early deceleration peak '' systolic function basis `` ejection fraction '' . With power 90 % alfa = 0.05 , group vary 9 17 patient need . In comparable trial drop-out rate 10 % . Taken consideration population study significant well systolic function heart failure patient study Sokos et al , difference may small . In conclusion , investigator estimate able detect clinically relevant , significant result 90 % power alfa = 0.05 25 patient group . 4 .
