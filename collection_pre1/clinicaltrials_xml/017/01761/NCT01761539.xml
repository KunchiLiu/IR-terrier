	<detailed_description>TITLE : Moderate Versus Aggressive Fluid Therapy Patients Mild Moderate Acute Pancreatitis BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES In United States , acute pancreatitis result 200,000 hospital admission year associate mortality 5 % . While protease inhibitor , platelet activate factor inhibitor , somatostatin study , pharmacologic agent show impact course acute pancreatitis treatment remain supportive . Fluid resuscitation recommend base animal data , however , recently limit clinical study available assess impact . Animal study use rat , dog , pig suggest acute pancreatitis compromise splanchnic perfusion pancreatic microcirculation . Work Banks et al demonstrate hemoconcentration associate necrosis inadequate resuscitation elevate hematocrit associate markedly increase rate necrosis . Blood urea nitrogen creatinine level also appear correlate mortality acute pancreatitis . Nonetheless , recent study yield contradictory result regard whether fluid use judiciously liberally . Retrospective work Gardner suggest early resuscitation beneficial . Other recent study however include work De Madaria et al suggest receive 4.1L fluid first 24 hour likely develop organ failure receive less . In randomized controlled trial fluid acute pancreatitis 76 patient severe pancreatitis , include renal failure , randomize massive 10-15cc/kg/hr ( mean 545 cc/hour ) versus less aggressive resuscitation , 5-10cc/kg/hr . Rates mechanical ventilation , abdominal compartment syndrome , sepsis , mortality higher massive resuscitation group In well do prospective study Wu et al 40 patient acute pancreatitis randomize goal direct management accord protocol versus standard therapy also randomize patient lactated ringer ( LR ) versus normal saline ( NS ) . They unable measure difference goal direct management standard therapy arm patient manage similarly term volume resuscitation . The rate systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) low group , 25 % , predict level 50 % . It demonstrate treated LR much less likely develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) NS . LR use study base result . The current study also employ system checkpoint use Wu et al intent compare moderate versus aggressive fluid resuscitation . OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE : Precise fluid management strategy patient acute pancreatitis unclear . The investigator principal aim perform well do randomize trial ass hypothesis aggressive fluid benefit mild moderate acute pancreatitis help standardize treatment patient . An additional goal pilot study determine effect size difference clinical improvement receive agressive versus moderate fluid aim estimate sample size large trial . STUDY DESIGN : Patients present Los Angeles County Hospital mild moderate pancreatitis focus population study . Pancreatitis diagnose use 2 3 criterion ; amylase lipase great 3 time upper limit normal , epigastric abdominal pain , image consistent acute pancreatitis . Available data suggest severe pancreatitis aggressive fluid rescusctiation may harmful patient excluded.Patients randomize aggressive versus moderate fluid within 4 hour diagnosis pancreatitis . The inclusion exclusion criterion assess . Randomization perform use computer program conceal allocation . The amount fluid intervention perform emergency department prior randomization record affect randomization strategy . Those aggressive hydration group receive bolus lactate ringer ( LR ) 20cc/kg LR start 3cc/kg LR . This protocol use well respected prior randomize trial significantly associate fluid overload adverse consequence . Those moderate hydration group receive bolus 10cc/kg start LR rate 1.5cc/kg/hr . Boluses give 30 minute . After 8-16 hour group hematocrit , Cr , BUN assess ( part standard procedure assess CBC complete metabolic panel ) acute pancreatitis.If patient moderate fluid group increase unchanged hematocrit , Cr , BUN bolused 20cc/kg LR fluid thereafter adjust 3cc/kg/hr LR . Those aggressive group decrease hematocrit , Cr , BUN time rate reduce 1.5cc/kg/hr LR . Those aggressive group increase unchanged hematocrit , Cr , BUN receive second bolus 20cc/kg LR . At 20-28 hour hematocrit , BUN , Cr assess measure take base level . On second day diet advanced clear decrease HCT , BUN , Cr afebrile minimal epigastric pain . Once patient tolerate regular diet without difficulty fluid decrease discretion treat physician . Patients assess symptomatic fliud overload checkpoint well throughout stay . If develop fluid overload include pit edema , ascites , anasacra , pulmonary edema , dyspnea fluid halt manage discretion treat physician . Patients develop oliguria , anuria hypotension also remove treatment protocol finding signify renal failure severe pancreatitis endpoint . If patient continue rise Cr , BUN , HCT second checkpoint , ie 32-36 hour also remove treatment protocol signifies refractory fluid resuscitation manage discretion treat physician . SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS : See inclusion exclusion criterion STRATIFICATION/RANDOMIZATION SCHEME : Stratification factor . Patients stratify prospectively . At end study subgroup analysis perform compare stratified 3 group ; result gallstone pancreatitis , alcoholic pancreatitis , pancreatitis due origins.There randomization patient moderate versus aggressive fluid group . Group randomization balance . Randomization perform SC-CTSI Bioinformatics Bioinformatics Group . ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY : If patient develop fluid overload include pit edema , ascites , anasacra , pulmonary edema , dyspnea remove treatment protocol manage discretion treat physician . Adverse event report IRB data safety monitor board comprise principal investigator medicine/gastroenterology , emergency medicine , surgery well entire study team . An outside senior physician gastroenterology surgery also participate . CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS : See Primary Secondary As pilot project additional goal study measure effect size large trial moderate versus aggeressive fluid may inform . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS : Descriptive statistic perform group , comparison make determine group balance stratification factor type pancreatitis . Patient characteristic compare group well determine imbalance possible covariates . We expect 40 % participant present gallstone , 40 % alcoholic pancreatitis , 20 % sample pancreatitis due cause . Approximately , 60 % sample expect Latino , gender ratio expect balanced . Patients classify afterward mild hospitalization &gt; 3 day length , moderate hospitalization 3-10 day , severe great 10 day necrosis complication pancreatitis develop.. Because pilot study , variable P &lt; .10 difference group include analysis possible confounder . For primary outcome evaluate proportion patient group improve assigned treatment , chi square analysis perform 8-16 hour 20-28 hour evaluate number participant receive moderate fluid . Logistic regression modeling use test difference rate control covariates . Survivial analysis use explore secondary aim determine difference time tolerate normal diet . Exploration also make relationship outcome patient characteristic determine factor need include stratification future study . All model follow intent-to-treat model primary factor assign group , regardless treatment . The main goal pilot study determine effect size , odds ratios confidence interval report use develop fully power study . A sensitivity analyse peformed use G starPower determine detectible difference . With proposed sample size 60 , would sufficient power detect decrease proportion participant require aggressive fluid 8-16 hour 17 % , versus expect 50 % patient randomized moderate treatment ( alpha = 0.05 , one side ; 1-beta = 0.80 ) .</detailed_description>
