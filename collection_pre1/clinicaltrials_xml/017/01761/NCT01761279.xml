	<brief_summary>Current standard practice remove colonic polyp find colonoscopy possible distinguish polyp malignant potential ( adenomatous ) negligable malignant potential ( non-adenomatous ) . Recent advance endoscope image technology allow endoscopists distinguish two type polyp examine minute surface detail . i-Scan new digital enhancement method aim enhance surface detail may enable similar accurate distinction adenomatous non-adenomatous polyp . Hypothesis : High definition white light endoscopy plus i-Scan improves diagnostic accuracy in-vivo assessment colonic polyp &lt; 10mm size high definition white light endoscopy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Definition Endoscopy With i-Scan Small Colonic Polyp Evaluation : The HiScope Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally polyp detect colonoscopy , except obvious cancer , remove . It felt small ( &lt; 10mm diameter ) hyperplastic polyp reliably distinguish adenomatous polyp endoscopists [ 1 ] . Therefore large number hyperplastic polyp remove unnecessarily . This result increase risk patient expose unnecessary polypectomy , increase cost health service cost processing great number histopathology specimen . The cost per specimen around Â£58 . This challenge distinguish small hyperplastic polyp small adenomatous polyp meet past decade use novel chromoendoscopy compute 'virtual chromoendoscopy ' technique . Chromoendoscopy involve use stain contrast dye highlight minute surface pattern mucosa gastrointestinal tract . The dye apply colonic mucosa via work channel endoscope . Vital stain cresyl violet methylene blue , take epithelial cell , use Japanese endoscopists many year . Work Kudo et al show use stain combination magnification endoscopy minute 'pit pattern ' colonic mucosal lesion could precisely examine classify . The pit describe surface open mucosal crypt . Kudo show surface pit pattern could predict histology lesion high accuracy [ 2-4 ] , enable distinction adenomatous hyperplastic polyp . Concerns regard potential harmful effect vital stain increase popularity alternative chromoendoscopy dye , indigocarmine [ 5 ] . Indigocarmine take cell lie colonic wall . Studies East Asia , USA Europe publish early part last decade show combine indigocarmine magnification endoscopy , neoplastic colonic polyp ( adenoma ) could distinguish non-neoplastic hyperplastic polyp accuracy rate 68-96 % [ 6-10 ] . By method , surface pattern could also identify small early colorectal cancer [ 11 ] . Subsequent study demonstrate indigocarmine could adequately distinguish adenomatous hyperplastic polyp without need optical magnification [ 12-15 ] . During past year new method closely examine lesion within colon develop . Digital image technique 'virtual chromoendoscopy ' system develop endoscope manufacturer 'push-button ' alternative chromoendoscopy dye , potentially simple quicker use . The first novel technology available narrow band imaging ( NBI ) system produce Olympus . A filter within endoscope selects narrow bandwidth blue green light , thus reduces red light . These wavelength penetrate superficial layer mucosa , highlight surface pattern microvasculature . Adenomatous polyp numerous prominent microvessels comparison hyperplastic poylps . This system show effective differentiate small hyperplastic adenomatous polyp accuracy 91 - 94 % [ 16-23 ] . The Fujinon Intelligent Colour Enhancement ( FICE ) system develop Fujinon use post-processor electronic colour filter technology allow range filter image different wavelength light view . Similar result NBI achieve characterisation small polyp [ 13 , 24 , 25 ] . More recently virtual chromoendoscopy system , i-Scan developed Pentax . i-Scan identifies area contrast adjacent pixel ( ie light border dark ) enhance contrast . Additionally similar method FICE , post-processor manipulation red , green blue component spectrum use enhance vessel surface structure . A single study Germany suggest i-Scan improves detection lesion flexible sigmoidoscopy accurately predict histology . There need data clinical efficacy i-Scan assessment colonic polyp , particularly UK population bowel cancer screen population , neither studied date . Through use new technology may possible accurately predict histology small polyp real time . Once in-vivo diagnosis make high confidence may possible small hyperplastic polyp discard , rather send histological analysis , leave situ [ 22 ] . This potential benefit reduce frequency consequent risk polypectomy patient could also reduce pathology cost . UK US guideline repeat surveillance colonoscopy adenoma detect baseline examination base number size histology adenomas [ 26 , 27 ] . At present 'rescope interval ' determine histology report resect polyp receive . With accurate in-vivo diagnosis interval may set immediately baseline colonoscopy complete . Whilst development endoscopic advance image technology welcome , important study determine achieve use , standard white-light colonoscopy . The American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy identify utility technology use real-time assessment diminutive ( &lt; 5mm ) colonic polyp key area study , publish guideline minimum standard new endoscopic technology meet use becomes widely adopt [ 28 ] . We aim evaluate HDWL HDWL + i-Scan real time assessment prediction histology small colonic polyp BCSP population .</detailed_description>
