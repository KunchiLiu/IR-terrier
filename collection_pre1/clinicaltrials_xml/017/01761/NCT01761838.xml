	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare change spinal stiffness back muscle activity spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT ) responder , non-responders asymptomatic participant . Additionally , investigator want compare amount lumbar degeneration SMT responder , non-responders asymptomatic participant . This study also determine presence pain modifies post-SMT spinal stiffness back muscle activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Underlying Mechanism Spinal Manipulative Therapy Effect Pain Physical Outcome Measures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SMT common manual therapy treat patient mechanical low back pain ( LBP ) . SMT define high velocity , low amplitude thrust technique . Specifically , clinician stand beside supine patient . The patient passively side-bent towards side manipulate . The clinician passively rotate patient delivers high velocity , low amplitude thrust anterior superior iliac spine posteroinferior direction . SMT indicate patient LBP judge spinal hypomobility malalignment . Recently , collaborator discover LBP subject benefit SMT identify prior treatment five-item clinical prediction rule . Compared non-responders , respond SMT : 1 ) 30 % decrease modify Oswestry Disability Index score , 2 ) significant immediate decrease spinal stiffness , 3 ) concurrent change lumbar multifidus muscle activity . Taken together , physical change experience SMT responder alone provide unique opportunity well understand mechanism underlie SMT . Since spinal stiffness important physical indicator SMT response , important understand causal relation pain , paraspinal/trunk muscle activity spinal stiffness . Although research show positive correlation pain muscle activity , paraspinal muscle activity spinal stiffness , causal relation pain , paraspinal/trunk muscle activity spinal stiffness remain unknown . Given background , induction temporary benign experimental pain asymptomatic individual help clarify causal relation improve understand physical response responder follow pain resolution SMT .</detailed_description>
