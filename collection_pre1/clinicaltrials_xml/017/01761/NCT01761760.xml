	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoking remain number one cause preventable morbidity mortality U.S. A number barrier note prevent access smoke cessation intervention , lack clinician training , time commitment require implement treatment , cost associate treatment . Thus , critically important effective intervention develop , make accessible relatively low cost , smoker . We recently develop Internet-based Contingency Management Intervention ( CM ) , , participant submit web-camera record video exhale CO monitor , earn money abstinence . Although cost associate provide monetary incentive contingent smoking abstinence likely less cost associate medical complication cause smoking , cost incentive often cite barrier CM . Thus , goal present proposal markedly decrease cost increase sustainability highly accessible Internet-based CM smoking cessation . Using iterative development process help team expert , social strategy video game intend fun engage develop Facebook ( `` Quitters , Incorporated '' ) . Treatment-seeking smoker able earn incentive contingent meet web-camera verify CO value consistent smoke abstinence . Three powerful , evidence-based incentive harness CM . The incentive consist : ( 1 ) individual contingency use improve game play , ( 2 ) social contingency , positive feedback virtual reward , give player acknowledge success abstinence improve game play , ( 3 ) group contingency require member group meet abstinence goal order unlock access certain game feature . After game development , assess feasibility , acceptability , enjoyability , preliminary efficacy video-game-based CM smoking cessation . A 7-week pilot study involve randomly assign participant ( N=100 ) either : ( 1 ) abstinent contingent , incentive deliver contingent quit smoking , ( 2 ) submission contingent , incentive deliver contingent submit video , independent quit smoking . The outcome pilot study impact future research development video-game-based CM intervention smoking , well alcohol drug use , medication compliance diabetes , asthma , condition . Game-based CM promote widespread access innovative , fun , sustainable intervention relatively low cost ( game available play free ) , thereby offer potential substantial public health impact .</detailed_description>
