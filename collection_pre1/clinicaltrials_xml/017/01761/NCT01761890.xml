	<brief_title>Front-line Treatment BCR-ABL+ Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML ) With Dasatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective describe , clinical practice , rate event lead permanent discontinuation 2 year treatment dasatinib frontline therapy newly diagnose CML patient . Imatinib mesylate , protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) target BCR-ABL , become last decade standard care Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia ( CML ) chronic phase ( CP ) 1-3 . Dasatinib second generation TKI , effective imatinib-resistant imatinib-intolerant patient , demonstrate superior efficacy imatinib early CP BCR-ABL+ CML patient 4,6,7 . Most data second generation TKIs company-sponsored study , generally implement select referral centre . The long-term outcome still unknown . The high rate study discontinuation observe within phase 3 study may influence mid-term long-term data interpretation6,7 . A long-term post-marketing surveillance large independent trial extremely important confirm feasibility frontline treatment second generation TKI dasatinib evaluate efficacy nationwide experience . Moreover , obtain deep molecular response extremely relevant order consider TKIs discontinuation . This condition know `` Complete Molecular Response '' ( CMR ) define accord sensitivity achieve ( definition see `` Criteria evaluation '' section ) . As far treatment discontinuation , two experience publish far , aim evaluate persistence CMR imatinib discontinuation . The first pilot study32 12 patient include . These 12 patient discontinue imatinib least 2 year CMR ( median duration negativity , 32 month ) . Six patient display molecular relapse detectable BCR-ABL transcript 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 month . Imatinib reintroduce lead novel molecular response . Six patient ( 50 % ) still undetectable level BCR-ABL transcript median follow-up 18 month ( range , 9-24 month ) . The result pilot trial confirm extended second trial , STIM trial33 : 100 patient enrol , median follow-up 17 month , 69 patient least 12 month follow-up : 42 ( 61 % ) 69 patient relapse ( 40 6 month , one patient month 7 , one month 19 ) . At 12 month , probability persistent CMR 69 patient 41 % ( 95 % CI 29-52 ) . All patient relapse responded reintroduction imatinib . An increase CMR rate could possibly translate high proportion patient candidate stop anti-CML treatment , high probability remain disease-free long term . Interestingly , dasatinib able induce high 36-month cumulative MR4 MR4.5 rate imatinib7 . The advantage possible future scenario could : first , possibility treatment discontinuation least patient chronic clinical adverse event ; second , potential reduction cost TKI treatment ( introduction TKI , cost CML treatment increase year year , increase prevalence CML patient ) . In summary , 1 ) Most data second generation TKIs company-sponsored study ; 2 ) The high rate study discontinuation observe within phase III study may influence data interpretation ; 3 ) A long-term post-marketing surveillance large independent trial extremely important confirm efficacy nationwide experience ; 4 ) The persistence CMR TKI discontinuation describe select patient `` deep '' molecular response ; 5 ) A stable CMR pre-requisite treatment discontinuation ; 6 ) A detailed description kinetic molecular response , potentially related subsequent treatment discontinuation , do .</detailed_description>
