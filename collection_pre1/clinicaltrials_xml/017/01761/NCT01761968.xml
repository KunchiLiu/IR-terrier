	<brief_title>Long-term Study Evaluating Effect Givinostat Patients With Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open label , long-term study test long-term safety , tolerability efficacy Givinostat patient PV , ET , primary MF , Post-PV MF , Post-ET MF follow core protocol cMPN ( i.e . Study DSC/07/2357/28 , Study DSC/08/2357/38 , Study DSC/12/2357/45 and/or core protocol cMPN ) , and/or patient-named compassionate use program ( regulated/allowed local regulation , e.g . Italy D.M . 8/5/2003 `` Uso terapeutico di medicinale sottoposto sperimentazione clinica '' publish G.U . n. 173 28 July 2003 , follow amendment ) . Eligible patient tolerate previous Givinostat treatment achieve clinical benefit end core protocol ; alternatively , eligible patient participate compassionate use program ( regulated/allowed local regulation , e.g . Italy D.M . 8/5/2003 `` Uso terapeutico di medicinale sottoposto sperimentazione clinica '' publish G.U . n. 173 28 July 2003 , follow amendment ) . In addition , patient must tolerate previous Givinostat treatment achieve clinical benefit end core protocol compassionate use program Givinostat , assess Investigator accord revise clinico-haematological ELN response criterion ( PV ET ) EUMNET response criterion ( MF ) . After provide informed write consent undertake protocol-related procedure , unique patient identification code ( patient ID ) assign patient , identify patient throughout his/her participation study never reuse case premature drop-out . Patients continue last tolerable dose treatment schedule Givinostat monotherapy . If patient previously receive Givinostat combination drug ( e.g . hydroxyurea ) core protocol compassionate use program , treat last tolerable dose combination . In general , dose study drug may increase study . However , since Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Givinostat chronic treatment recently identify proven tolerable Polycythenia Vera patient ( i.e . 100 mg b.i.d . ) , select patient may eligible escalation Givinostat dose level upon consultation write permission Italfarmaco S.p.A. designee . Assessment safety efficacy perform quarterly visit visit also include laboratory test ECG examination . During visit clinical benefit assess Investigator accord revise clinico-haematological ELN response criterion ( PV ET ) EUMNET response criterion ( MF ) . Patients consider continued treatment basis clinical response : - patient continue derive clinical benefit participate study , allow continue study medication ; - patient derive clinical benefit participate study , discontinue study treatment . For patient previously participate compassionate use program Givinostat decision continue treatment base assessment continued clinical benefit derive study therapy . Of note , since long-term study , quarterly visit Investigator include his/her clinical evaluation patient 's benefit-risk assessment , take account clinical course patient Study visit time ( i.e . `` clinical benefit '' , define paragraph ) also possible treatment option available time visit perform . The dose Givinostat modify protocol specify toxicity . The treatment may continue Marketing Authorization Givinostat , currently plan next 5 year ( note : Germany , long-term study initially limit 2 year treatment ) . Patients may discontinue study treatment time remain study therapy long derive clinical benefit . Safety monitor visit throughout entire duration study . Treatment administer outpatient basis patient follow regularly physical laboratory test , specify protocol ; case hospitalization , treatment continue interrupted accord Investigators ' decision . In case approve label cover whole study population , Givinostat provide Sponsor patient fulfil criterion approve label drug still derive benefit Givinostat time commercial availability .</detailed_description>
