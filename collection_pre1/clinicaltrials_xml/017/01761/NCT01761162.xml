	<criteria>The following initial inclusion criterion must meet subject enrol consider MRIprocedure : Age great 18 year Subject body height great 140 cm ( 4 ' 7 '' ) Able willing complete MRI test Able provide write informed consent Available followup visit study site Implanted pacemaker system consist Entovis pacemaker ( DRT , SRT ) one two Setrox S 53 Setrox S 60 pacemaker lead ( ) . ( No lead Setrox S ( 53 60 cm ) lead may implant . This include lead extension abandon lead subject . ) Pacemaker implant pectorally All pacemaker system component implant , reposition , exchange least 5 week prior enrollment Underling rhythm identifiable sense test All pace threshold measureable less equal 2.0 V @ 0.4 m Absence phrenic nerve stimulation 4.8V @ 1.0 m Pacing impedance 200 1500 ohm Able willing use Cardio Messenger At preMRI procedure , follow procedurerelated criterion must meet subject undergo MRI scan : Absence phrenic nerve stimulation 4.8V @ 1.0 m |pacing threshold PreMRI followup pace threshold baseline| ≤ 0.5 V All pace threshold measureable ≤ 2.0 V @ 0.4 m The pacemaker system implant least 6 week . Subject pacemaker lead explant , exchange reposition previous 6 week . All lead impedance 200 1500 ohm . Battery status least 30 % capacity Enrolled clinical study For pacemaker system include atrial lead , subject either Persistent atrial arrhythmia ( lasting longer 7 day require cardioversion ) Permanent atrial arrhythmia Life expectancy less three month Pregnancy Cardiac surgery expect next three month Implanted medical device may interact MRI , : abandon pacemaker/ICD lead lead extension mechanical valve active medical device nonMRI compatible device metallic artifacts/components body may interact MRI</criteria>
