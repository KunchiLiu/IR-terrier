	<brief_title>A 2-Part Study Assess Safety Tolerability , pk , Effects Histology Some Clinical Parameters Givinostat Ambulant Children With DMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 child enrol study follow : first 4 child treat low dose level Givinostat . If none stop criterion describe study protocol meet 2 week treatment low dose , review team determine escalate dose level ( i.e. , intermediate dose level ) use treatment additional 8 child treat intermediate dose . The 4 child previously treat low dose level also switch intermediate dose level . If none stop criterion meet 2 week treatment intermediate dose , review team determine subsequent escalate dose level use treatment additional 8 child treat high dose . All child treat intermediate dose level switch high dose level . Once 20 child enrol Part 1 study treat least 2 week , review team determine recommend dose ( RD ) use Part 2 base safety tolerability profile observe pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analyse . All child enrol switch RD level , administer subsequent 12 month study ( Part 2 ) . The additional child ( ) enrol Part 2 study receive RD Givinostat 12 month . The total duration study 15 month additional 12 month extension phase .</detailed_description>
