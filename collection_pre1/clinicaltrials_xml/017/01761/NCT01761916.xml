	<detailed_description>The postpartum period represent stage pregnancy-puerperal still rarely addressed scientifically .

The investigator ' primary assumption clonidine well effectiveness decrease frequency pressure peak compare captopril . A triple blind randomize clinical trial conduct . Postpartum woman hypertensive disorder pregnancy , admit obstetric ICU IMIP include research . After inclusion study , drug high blood pressure , accord randomization ( captopril clonidine ) use . clonidine captopril administer dose 25mg 0.1mg respectively . If control blood pressure 20 minute new hypotensive dos administer total 150mg/day ( six tablet ) Captopril 0.6 mg / day ( six tablet ) clonidine . After exceeded allow dose , drug may associate . Initially , nifedipine ( 30mg/day 60mg/day ) accord service routine . The goal intervention maintain systolic blood pressure 170mmHg diastolic pressure 110mmHg , low possible dose . Thus , medication increase need arise , accord measurement take daily attend physician nursing staff .</detailed_description>
