	<brief_summary>This study Phase I , first human , dose-escalation study MORAb-066 , investigational humanize immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) target TF-expressing malignancy include breast , pancreatic , colorectal , non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ( adenocarcinoma ) . This open-label study ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics MORAb-066 administer weekly . This study identify MTD MORAb-066 administer IV weekly 28-day cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study MORAb-066 Targeting TF-expressing Malignancies Including Breast , Pancreatic , Colorectal , NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective -To evaluate safety tolerability weekly intravenous ( IV ) infusions MORAb-066 . Secondary Objectives - To identify dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MORAb-066 . - To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) property MORAb-066 . - To identify , basis safety , PK , pharmacodynamics ( PDx ) data , recommend Phase II dose schedule MORAb-066 . - To make preliminary assessment antitumor activity MORAb-066 . - T - To detect antibody response ( i.e. , human antihuman antibody [ HAHA ] ) multiple IV infusion MORAb-066 . Exploratory Objectives - To evaluate presence tissue factor ( TF ) substrates protease activate receptor 2 applicable . - To evaluate archived tumor tissue TF overexpression immunohistochemistry . - To evaluate whether potential biomarkers correlate response MORAb-066 .</detailed_description>
