	<brief_summary>In study look primary focal dystonias , include dystonias limb , eye , jaw face , neck , vocal chord . This study use magnet resonance imaging ( MRI ) see brain reacts rest finger-tapping task . The investigator test hypothesis disturbance functional connectivity within motor , affective cognitive basal ganglion network primary focal dystonia ( PFD ) underlie motor non-motor symptom disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After write consent obtain , subject undergo neurological examination board certify neurologist complete Montreal Cognitive Assessment Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . Primary focal dystonia ( PFD ) patient dystonia assess commonly used clinical rating scale dystonia use Unified Dystonia Rating Scale , Fahn-Marsden Scale , Global Dystonia Rating Scale , Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scaleâ€”TWSTRS , Jankovic Rating Scale blepharospasm . Patients control affective symptom assess use Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale , Beck Depression Inventory . Clinical evaluation perform University Colorado Denver Denver Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Hospital Brain Imaging Center Anschutz Medical Campus , prior Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan . Consenting , exam , clinical scale assessment estimate take 30-40 minute complete . MRI scan protocol MRI scanning perform use 8-channel head coil 3 Tesla General Electric ( GE ) Signa MR scanner system FDA-approved clinical MR scanning . The principal investigator and/or co-investigator present every scanning session . Head motion minimize use cushion passive restraint . The total MRI scanning session take approximately 50-60 minute , include set-up time scan time , include follow MRI run : 1 . Anatomic scan : A high-resolution 3D spoil gradient echo T1-weighted image ( ~8 minute ) collect image registration normalization . The subject simply rest sequence run . A diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) scan ( ~10 minute ) acquire use double spin-echo diffusion echo-planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence 32 diffusion direction . 2 . Resting-state task ( ~6 min ) : Subject remain motionless eye close try sleep think anything particular . 3 . Motor tap task ( ~6 min ) : Subject performs sequential five-finger finger-tapping sequence 30 sec block alternate 30 sec rest . The tap task design minimize variance performance within individual pace audible cue . During rest condition subject remain motionless think anything particular . A similar motor task show feasible primary dystonia ( PD ) patient lead striatal dopamine release . 4 . Repeat motor task functional Magnetic Resonance Imagine ( fMRI ) scan ( ~6 minute ) - subject use opposite hand perform sequential finger tap task , otherwise scan identical . Behavioral assessment 1 . Button press finger-tapping task scan record use MRI-compatible five-button response unit . 2 . Surface electromyographic ( EMG ) recording obtain resting-state motor task fMRI scan assess spontaneous dystonic motor activity , movement rest , muscle activity tap . Simultaneous EMG monitoring perform use EMG Amplifier design fMRI acquisition small adhesive pad EMG electrodes tap skin .</detailed_description>
