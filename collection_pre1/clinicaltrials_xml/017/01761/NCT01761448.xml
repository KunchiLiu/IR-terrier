	<brief_summary>The object study determine improvement obtain long-term adherence home-based rehabilitation program ( cardiac rehabilitation phase III ) follow guide exercise training prescription supervise innovative system specifically design optimize training effect maximize patientÂ´s security compare standard care give country kind patient . The innovated Guided Exercise- ( GEx ) - System consist sensor monitor vital parameter exercise training session use combination software provide feedback patient base training prescription provide doctor level exertion monitor . This main trial follow pretrial used ECG sensor validate hospital rehabilitation phase II practicability vest integrate ECG sensor possibility technical problem innovative GEx- system test real-life patient phase III home ( ID 11-094 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Cycle GEx ( Guided- Exercise- Main Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study , include 150 patient three country compare data standard care give country data receive use new GEx- system . In Germany rehabilitation process Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) patient hospital ( phase II , three week ) 50 patient recruit , include 25 use innovative System 25 control group use new Guided Exercise System ) . Patients interventional group make familiar Guided Exercise System exercise training hospital ( phase II ) . This Guided Exercise ( GEx- ) - System consist easy wear- vest integrate electrode measure ECG , respiration activity , furthermore PDA mobile phone touch screen interaction patient patient station interface personal digital assistant ( PDA ) professional station able synchronize exercise plan prescribe professional extract monitor data PDA upload professional system use internet connection . Both intervention control group undergo baseline evaluation end evaluation include test clinical routine like cardiopulmonary test ( CPX ) , echocardiography lactate measurement . They also answer questionnaire refer quality life use system . During train phase home interventional group test supervise training system endurance training run , bike walk resistance training perform exercise rubber band ( least 3x week 5 month accord generate prescription plan train hospital ) . They report daily activity diary . The control group report physical activity diary without use Gex- System . At end data investigate determine feasibility determine possible improvement obtain long-term adherence home- base rehabilitation program follow guide exercise training prescription supervise GEx- System .</detailed_description>
