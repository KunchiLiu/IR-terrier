	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluating Efficacy Safety One Dose Versus Two Doses Influenza Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study : 1 . Evaluate efficacy safety double dose seasonal flu vaccine compare single dose . 2 . Determine specific cellular immune response produce first second vaccine dose seasonal flu vaccine vitro stimulation specific memory cell ( A B flu virus ) . 3 . Evaluate humoral immune response produce one dose v two dose seasonal flu vaccine measure serum antibody level . 4 . Evaluate clinical efficacy stationary flu vaccine solid organ transplant recipient . 5 . Evaluate long term cellular humoral response ( 1 year ) seasonal flu vaccine . 6 . Characterize genetic expression profile immune response flu vaccine solid organ transplant recipient mean genetic sub-study . 7 . Characterize flu vaccine effect ( one dose two dos ) antibody anti-HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ) , influence rejection rate solid organ transplant recipient , mean immunologic sub-study .</detailed_description>
