The current study pilot study principal objective determine feasibility recruitment , retention adherence international multicentre RCT evaluate efficacy thrice-weekly home exercise one year among woman vertebral fracture . The intervention develop expert exercise prescription base rigorous literature review Cochrane meta-analysis conduct . Physiotherapists conduct 6 home visit participant deliver intervention ( social visit control ) use similar model previous work team others . Secondary outcome pilot study hypothesize among causal pathway link exercise fracture risk , include low extremity strength , posture , balance , well fall fracture . Additional secondary outcome include quality life , pain , exercise self-efficacy , cost intervention , risk adverse event associate exercise . The recruitment retention process summarize use CONSORT flow diagram , report result accordance CONSORT criterion . Analyses feasibility objective descriptive base estimate 95 % confidence interval , feasibility assess relative criterion define priori . Differences secondary outcome evaluate intention treat analysis via independent student T-tests , Chi Square logistic regression . The Bonferroni method use adjust level significance secondary outcome overall level alpha=0.05 . Even large trial prof feasible , current trial one large exercise study among representative group woman vertebral fracture date , evaluate feasibility cost comprehensive home exercise program , effect important secondary outcome .
