	<brief_title>Trial Three Treatments Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , brace use prevent progression idiopathic scoliosis child . The evidence brace physical activity treatment idiopathic scoliosis poor . Only one low quality study compare brace physical exercise , show statistical difference reduction progression scoliosis curve group . To draw valid conclusion effectiveness postural specific physical exercise brace therapeutic intervention compare self mediate activity exercise group , randomize control trial research design use . Preliminary data suggest approximately 8 hour night-time brace over-corrective brace effective bracing 23 hour per day . Night-time bracing attractive since wear brace limit amount time . Several theory propose adolescent period skeletal growth , bone deformation may occur due combination asymetrical growth plate activity , vertebral body weakness imbalance muscle force joint flexibility . An association low bone mineral density idiopathic scoliosis report literature . Adequate physical activity level requirement normal growth development childhood adolescent . It well document physical exercise associate improvement muscle strength , aerobic fitness motor development also bone density may help decrease risk osteopenic related bone deformation . Patients include study randomize one three group . Each three group receive physical activity prescription accord World Health Organisation recommendation . One group additionally wear hyper-corrective night-time brace . One group additionally perform postural scoliosis-specific exercise . Patients want randomized alternative treatment clinical trial receive brace current standard treatment offer . The purpose study compare risk curve progression different group . Curve progression measure x-ray . Participation study last curve progress , cessation skeletal growth . Participants brace instruct wear brace 8 hour per night . Participants receive scoliosis specific train receive 3x90 minute physiotherapist guide session additional session provide every 6 month entirety study . All participant recommend physically active least 60 minute per day .</detailed_description>
