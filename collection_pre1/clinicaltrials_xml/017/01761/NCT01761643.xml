	<brief_title>CCTG 595 : Text Messaging Intervention Improve Adherence PrEP High-risk MSM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 400 HIV-uninfected men sex men ( MSM ) male female ( M F ) transgender individual recent high-risk transmission behavior enrol study . Each subject follow 48 week enrollment last subject . The primary endpoint measure 48 week . All subject start PrEP TDF + FTC fix dose combination give daily . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) either iTAB text message adherence reminder intervention SoC SoC alone arm . Subjects place iTAB intervention arm receive personalize , automate texting system maintain adherence retention . Both group receive access PrEP accordance standardize comprehensive method prescribe , risk reduction counseling , adherence counseling , clinical assessment include safety monitoring , well HIV STD screen . TDF 300 mg + FTC 200 mg fix dose combination give orally daily start baseline visit ( month 0 ) continue throughout study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Man transgender M F sex men . Age 18 year old . Subjects must substantial ongoing risk acquisition HIV evident one following : Has least one HIV infect sexual partner ≥4 week . No condom use anal intercourse ≥3 male sex partner HIVpositive unknown HIV status last 3 month . No condom use anal sex ≥1 male partner STI diagnosis last 3 month . Negative HIV infection rapid HIV test confirm negative NAT sensitive method antibody antigen test . Acceptable laboratory value past 30 day : Calculated creatinine clearance least 60 mL/min CockcroftGault formula ( eCcr ( male ) mL/min = [ ( 140 age year ) x ( lean body weight kg ) ] / ( 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/ aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 750/ mm3 Platelets &gt; 75,000/ mm3 Unable give inform consent . Active hepatitis B ( positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBSAg ) HBSAg negative/ HB core antibody positive/ HBV PCR positive ) . Has substantial medical condition , opinion investigator would preclude participation , define cardiovascular condition may lead increase risk complication place study drug . gastrointestinal condition would impair absorption study drug . neurological psychiatric condition would significantly impair ability adhere PrEP . calculate GFR &lt; 60 mL/min . alcohol drug abuse dependence would significantly impair ability adhere PrEP ( severe impairment ) . medical condition would unacceptably increase risk harm study drug significantly impair ability adhere PrEP . Suspected sensitivity allergy study drug component . Currently use essential product medication interacts study drug following : ART ( include nucleoside analogs , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , protease inhibitor investigational antiretroviral agent ) Agents know nephrotoxic potential : aminoglycoside antibiotic ( include gentamicin ) IV amphotericin B cidofovir cisplatin foscarnet IV pentamidine IV vancomycin oral IV gancyclovir agent significant nephrotoxic potential Drugs slow renal excretion Probenecid Immune system modulators Systemic chemotherapeutic agent ( i.e . cancer treatment medication ) Ongoing systemic corticosteroid ( exception short course taper steroid dos asthma self limited condition ) . Interleukin2 ( IL2 ) Interferon ( alpha , beta , gamma ) Other agent know significant interaction TDF FTC Proteinuria 2+ great urine dipstick Signs symptom suggestive acute HIV infection Any reason condition opinion investigator would interfere participation , complicate interpretation study outcome data , otherwise interfere achieve study objective .</criteria>
