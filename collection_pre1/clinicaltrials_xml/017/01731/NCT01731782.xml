	<brief_summary>Patients experience pain surgery mostly abdominal wound , even wound small . Decreasing pain many benefit . It improve comfort , decrease stress response might improve outcome surgery . Local anesthesia ( numbing agent give directly site pain via needle ) give decrease pain felt surgery decrease need strong pain medication negative side effect . One promising way give local pain medication call `` transversus abdominis plane '' TAP block . This method work directly blocking nerve abdomen cause pain patient feel incision surgery . This do injecting numb agent ( Bupivacaine ) area abdomen nerve locate cause pain . In case nerve carry sensation , bupivacaine block pain sensation travel particular nerve . Patients randomize ( like flip coin ) receive either normal saline injection bupivacaine injection . The purpose study prove effectiveness local anesthetic give via TAP block improve postoperative pain , decrease use pain medication , decrease postoperative nausea vomit improve surgical outcome hospital length stay laparoscopic colorectal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation TAP Block Given During Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery Help Control Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using standard surgical procedure , surgeon proceed plan laparoscopic surgery . All procedure do straight laparoscopic technique accord standard care . At completion procedure , laparoscopic control , patient TAP block place attend surgeon . The clinical research nurse involve research prep solution inject surgeon blind whether patient receive normal saline Marcaine TAP block . The block administer costal margin iliac crest anterior axillary line . A Braun Stimuplex A insulated needle ( 80 mm 21 gauge ) 0.5 mL/kg solution ( max 30 ml ) pass skin , continue two distinct `` pop '' felt , indicate needle pierce two fascial layer . The needle deem inter-muscular plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle respectively , target spinal nerve plane . The laparoscope visualize needle tip ensure penetrate peritoneum inject pre-peritoneally . The local anesthetic infiltrate two separate injection plane side . If sub-peritoneal bleb see raise laparoscope , needle withdrawn slightly . Two third solution inject , needle withdrawn 5 mm remain solution inject . If inject correct plane , smooth raise area fluid , cover transversus see via laparoscope . This procedure repeat patient side , complete bilateral block . Depending randomization , patient receive one follow solution : Group A : Represents control group receive 0.5 ml/kg 0.9 % normal saline maximum 30 ml . Group B : Represents experimental group receive 0.5 ml/kg 0.25 % Marcaine ( bupivacaine ) maximum 30 ml .</detailed_description>
