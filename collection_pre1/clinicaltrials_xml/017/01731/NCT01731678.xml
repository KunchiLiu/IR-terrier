	<brief_summary>Major depression ( MDD ) adolescents major public health problem . MDD affect approximately 15 % adolescent ; associate impairment social , family , academic functioning , major risk factor suicide - lead cause death adolescent . Unfortunately , paucity treatment option age group . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) class medication approve treat MDD adolescent , rate remission follow treatment SSRIs 30 45 percent . Cognitive behavior therapy associate similar remission rate access limit . Most adolescent require one therapeutic intervention order achieve full symptom control . Collectively , overwhelm evidence additional treatment option urgently need improve outcome teens MDD . One novel treatment adolescent MDD repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . Studies child limit ( total 23 case ) . This surprising give evidence suggest young adult subject MDD respond well rTMS ( 56 % response rate ) old subject . This limited experience rTMS adolescent MDD represent substantial gap knowledge , recently recognize publication call study rTMS adolescent depression . Most importantly , mechanism action rTMS adolescent MDD well understood . The objective application develop understanding brain alteration associate positive clinical change occur rTMS adolescent MDD . Such knowledge provide basis pursue rTMS adolescent MDD rational therapeutic technique . Specific Aim : To compare effect rTMS DLPFC glutamate concentration adolescent MDD . The investigator hypothesize increase ( normalization control ) DLPFC glutamate three week rTMS . Furthermore , change glutamate concentration correlate change MDD symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The purpose study identify neuroimaging , physiological , clinical predictor response , remission , recovery repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation youth treatment resistant major depressive disorder . BACKGROUND : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) major public health problem adolescent . Unfortunately , effectively target treatment option age group . Current remedy limit effectiveness youth response remission rate great 60 30 % respectively treatment effect sustain throughout life cycle . Further , ongoing controversy persist regard safety antidepressant youth . Current intervention develop solely target symptom rather underlie neurobiology . Most importantly , way accurately predict individual patient 's response intervention . Consequently , critical need optimally target intervention directly address relevant pathophysiology depression . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) target left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) effective adult depression . rTMS twice likely result response ( relative risk RR : 2.35 [ 95 % confidence interval CI : 1.70-3.25 ] ) remission ( RR : 2.24 [ 95 % CI : 1.53-3.27 ] sham procedure Evidence youth also encouraging , 66 % response rate pilot data ( see Summary Progress ) . The DLPFC play critical role emotional regulation , directly connect depressive symptomology . Our lab others clearly implicated structural functional deficit DLPFC youth MDD . What known biomarkers best predict response , remission , recovery rTMS youth treatment resistant MDD . As response universal , significant gap knowledge . Our basic model rTMS increase expression BDNF , up-regulates activity endocannabinoids , increase glutamate concentration , increase DLPFC activity - correcting deficit see MDD . These biologic change enhance executive control mood state ( see pilot data Summary Progress ) . These positive effect may moderate comorbidity ( i.e. , social phobia ) genotype ( i.e. , BDNF ) . How model fit response , remission , recovery yet fully test information potential directly clinically meaningful . The central aim project evaluate predictor rTMS response , remission , recovery base integrated neuroimaging , physiological , clinical measure . While clinical trial per se ( efficacy primary outcome measure ) , use non-randomized sham lead single active ( rTMS ) arm study design framework biomarker discovery . To accomplish goal , pursue follow specific aim : The primary aim identify baseline neuroimaging , physiological , clinical predictor response 3 week rTMS treatment adolescent treatment resistant MDD .</detailed_description>
