	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well degarelix acetate radiation therapy work treat patient prostate cancer . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , degarelix acetate , may lessen amount androgen make body . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving degarelix acetate together radiation therapy may work well treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Degarelix Acetate Before During Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect neoadjuvant degarelix ( degarelix acetate ) prostate dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) testosterone level . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect degarelix acetate androgen-regulated gene expression apoptosis assess immunohistochemistry , complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) microarray analysis reverse transcriptase ( RT ) -polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . II . To determine effect degarelix acetate follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) FSH receptor expression prostate cancer surround microenvironment . OUTLINE : Patients receive degarelix acetate subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course . Beginning week 15 , patient also undergo standard external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) 8.5 week .</detailed_description>
