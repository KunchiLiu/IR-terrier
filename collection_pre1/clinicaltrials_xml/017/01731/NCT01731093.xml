	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety , bioavailability , effectiveness organic yeast-selenium compound reduce brain oxidative stress . Oxidative stress brain link variety oif disorder include Alzheimer 's disease . Selenium powerful antioxidant could prove useful reduce harmful effect oxidative stress brain may help prevent disease Alzheimer 's . Our recent work demonstrate specific type selenium compound greatly influence 's ability enhance brain health prevent Alzheimer change mouse model disease . This study enroll 24 participant allow u test hypotheses yeast-selenium supplementation safe elderly , specific formulation reduces brain oxidative stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Placebo-controlled , single-center , multiple ascend dose study . Approximately 8 healthy volunteer enrol 3 sequential cohort , total 24 enrolled subject . All subject treat study drug placebo 12 week . Subjects see clinic follow visit : Screening , Baseline ( Day 1 ) , Day 2 , Day 4 , Day 7 ( Week 1 ) , Week 2 , Week 4 , Week 6 , Week 8 , Week 12 study drug . An additional safety visit Week 14 ( two week study drug discontinuation ) require study participant . Subjects undergo blood draw , urine collection , assessment vital sign , review Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) Adverse Events ( AEs ) well change concomitant medical condition medication every visit . Routine medical examination perform study screen enrollment , Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 4 , Week 6 , Week 8 , Week 12 , Week 14 visit . MRI perform subject Screening ensure safety lumbar puncture . Research procedure also include lumbar puncture Screening Week 12 visit . A designated Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) evaluate safety subject enrol complete cohort escalate next cohort . The DSMB review safety data ( i.e . AE SAE ) Week 14 . The committee may also request review additional data . The DSMB also convene event dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) determine whether stop rule accrual met .</detailed_description>
