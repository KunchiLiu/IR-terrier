	<detailed_description>This open label study expand work group animal , ex-vivo human lung human subject . Both 2-dimensional 3-dimensional image obtain use 1H MRI comparing image obtain breathe oxygen obtain breathe room air . Objectives - To determine 1H magnetic resonance image human lung airway obtain single breath-hold gate breathe image study adequate signal level image contrast extract regional lung functional information oxygen contrast agent . - To determine short term reproducibility lung functional imaging subset subject ( 5 control subject 5 subject lung disease ) repeat MRI study ( Visit 2 ) time point ≥ 1 week ≤ 4 week Visit 1</detailed_description>

Evidence personally sign date informed consent document indicate subject inform pertinent aspects trial . 4 . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit trial procedure . Exclusion Criteria Subjects Lung and/or Airway Disease : Subjects present follow included trial : 1 . Unable undergo 3.0Tesla MRI exam lung chest contraindication ( e.g . metal eye , claustrophobia ) ; 2 . Unable receive 100 % oxygen breathe potential hypercapnia ( SpO2 &lt; 90 % FEV1 &lt; 1 L ) ; 3 . Participation clinical trial study drug may impact lung function past 14 day ; 4 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry trial .
