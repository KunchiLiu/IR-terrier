	<brief_summary>This prospective , open label , randomize multicenter phase-II study evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) 2nd line treatment patient locally advanced metastatic clear-cell renal cell cancer ( cc-RCC ) receive everolimus ( arm A ) comparison tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) ( arm B ) . Following 2nd line treatment , patient switch TKI arm A everolimus arm B . All patient receive bevacizumab standardized first-line treatment . Another key element study analysis predictive biomarkers , perform serum tumor tissue , respectively . Serum sample collect prespecified timepoints throughout study analyse SELDI-TOF-MS DIGE . Candidate proteins think predict therapeutic outcome candidate subject target validation Western Blot ELISA . In addition , formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue collect prospectively analyse micro RNA ( miRNA ) . Candidate miRNAs predict therapeutic outcome validate quantitative RT-PCR . Furthermore , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) generate blood drawing routine visit . The primary objective correlate marker profile define FFPE tissue profile obtain CTCs order validate expression base marker ant change different treatment line .</brief_summary>
