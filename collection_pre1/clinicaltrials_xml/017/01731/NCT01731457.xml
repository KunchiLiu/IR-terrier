	<brief_summary>The aim study : 1. assessment ischemia injury kidney retrieve standard expand criterion decease donor transplantation 2. assessment efficacy kidney ischemia injury decrease 3. assessment influence kidney ischemia injury decrease function transplantation For purpose research one hundred kidney retrieve deceased donor ( standard expand criterion decease donor ) transplantation . All kidney transplantation store machine perfusion hypothermia continuous flow - Organ Recovery Systems LifePort - single kidney self-contained perfusion system . For kidney allograft assessment use measurement perform machine perfusion hypothermia : renal flow , resistance , lactate dehydrogenase , lactate ischemia injury marker measure fourth hour perfusion perfusion fluid . For kidney ischemia injury assessment marker measure : tumour necrosis factor ( TNF alfa ) , interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , cystatin C , kidney Injury Molecule ( KIM-1 ) , neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) , complement component C3 , caspase 3 . Every time pair retrieve kidney kidney randomise one group : - group 1 ) - 50 kidney - examine group - `` cure '' etanercept ( ENBREL ) first hour perfusion add drug perfusion fluid , - group 2 ) - 50 kidney - control group - without intervention . Ischemia injury marker measure perfusion fluid kidney two time ( first fourth hour perfusion ) assessment efficacy kidney ischemia injury decrease . Results measurement kidney ischemia injury transplantation , parameter machine perfusion hypothermia donor parameter correlate kidney allograft function post transplantation . Immediate , delay slow graft function , primary non-function , kidney function assess creatinine concentration creatinine clearance one day , seven day , two week , 1 , 6 12 month post transplantation kidney graft survival 6 12 month post transplantation analyse .</brief_summary>
