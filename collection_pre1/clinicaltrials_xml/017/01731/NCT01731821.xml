	<brief_title>Nonstented Stump-closed vs Duct-to-Mucosa Pancreaticojejunostomy After Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreaticoduodenectomy standard surgical approach resectable pancreatic tumor periampullary tumor . It consider safe procedure result continuous improvement surgical technique year . Although postoperative mortality obviously decrease , pancreatic fistula still major challenge pancreatic surgery remain major cause postoperative morbidity mortality pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) , range 5 % 30 % . Many risk factor show cause pancreatic fistula ( PF ) operation , include advanced age , prolonged operation time , intraoperative hemorrhage , BMI , soft pancreas , size main pancreatic duct texture remnant pancreas . Among , soft pancreatic texture without dilate main pancreatic duct regard important risk factor predict pancreatic fistula . The serious consequence pancreatic fistula result pancreatic juice become activate bile intestinal fluid , eventually corrupt PJ anastomosis surround normal tissue . The corrosion vasculature lead lethal hemorrhage , main cause mortality pancreaticoduodenectomy . Furthermore , pancreatin , together bacteria alimentary tract , lead intra-abdominal infection abscess . To reduce pancreatic fistula rate , several technique describe alternative conventional PJ anastomosis . Duct-to-mucosa suture , bind pancreaticojejunostomy end-to-side invaginated fashion widely use current clinical setting . Some non-randomized study show duct-to-mucosa method relatively safe approach . However , prospective clinical study find comparison conventional end-to-side anastomosis , duct-to-mucosa obviously decrease incidence pancreatic fistula well operative complication . The Peng 's bind anastomosis technique might relatively simple operate shorter operative time , raw pancreatic surface expose jejunal lumen directly reconstruction , activate pancreatic juice might lead hemorrhage vascular corrosion . Moreover , wide large pancreatic stump fit size jejunal lumen , could lead anastomosis ischemia leakage . The duct-to-mucosa method affect size pancreatic remnant jejunal lumen . The seromuscular layer jejunum cover pancreatic stump completely low incidence postoperative hemorrhage . It prove superior invagination anastomosis term anastomotic patency function . Unfortunately , case small main pancreatic duct normal soft pancreas , duct-to-mucosa approach difficult operate take surgery time , simultaneously increase incidence postoperative pancreatic fistula ( POPF ) . Therefore , difficult find single superior strategy applies every case . Selecting optimal pancreaticojejunal anastomotic method base different texture pancreas various size main pancreatic duct . The postoperative pancreatic fistula ( POPF ) , determine postoperative mortality , length hospital stayï¼Œ dependent definition , report 16 % patient . The purpose study determine whether new anastomosis call `` nonstented stump-closed '' pancreaticojejunostomy reduce POPF rate downgrade compare common accept duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy pancreaticoduodenectomy . This single-centre , open , randomize control trail conduct follow International Study Group Pancreatic Fistula ( ISGPF ) criteria pancreatic fistula ( PF ) . The primary endpoint POPF rate , others include overall postoperative complication rate severity reoperation rate hospital stay . Objectives : Through comparison classic pancreatic duct-to-mucosa anastomosis , evaluate whether `` nonstented stump close '' pancreaticojejunal anastomosis reduce pancreatic fistula complication incidence ; evaluate safety maneuverability . Patients method : patient diagnose periampullar occupation resect pancreaticoduodenectomy evaluate surgery , include CT , Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) , Ultrasound B , blood biochemical check cardiac thoracical evaluation . Before surgery , patient divide two group randomization . After pancreaticoduodenectomy , randomization number decide procedure pancreaticojejunostomy . Staging investigation standard include : pancreatic enhance CT ; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) ; PET-CT necessary ; Randomization : Block randomization do use computer generate sheet . Randomization perform 1 day operation . All surgery perform general anesthesia epidural analgesia . The surgery either perform direct supervision pancreatic surgeon experience pancreaticojejunostomy surgery . Operative time , blood loss , blood product replacement intraoperative detail record proforma . Patients shift postoperatively anesthesia care unit ( PCU ) observation subsequently recovery high dependency ward stabilize . Postoperative detail include period postoperative pancreatic fistula , biliary leakage , postoperative haemorrhage , postoperative pancreatitis , hospital stay complication record . Postoperative mortality define 30-day mortality plus death discharge surgery . Data management : All collect data enter statistical software package subsequent analysis Main research variable : Primary Outcome : The primary endpoint postoperative pancreatic fistula ( POPF ) rate . Secondary Outcome Measures : postoperative hospital stay time ; anastomosis time ; reoperation rate ; morbidity</detailed_description>
