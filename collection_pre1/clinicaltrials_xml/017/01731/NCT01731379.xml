	<brief_summary>Investigation application possibility optical spectroscopy within field surgical resection procedure spare nerve tissue . Optical spectroscopy enables possibility specifically differentiate different ( human ) tissue . The hypothesis incorporation technique exist medical device ( e.g . medical blade ) would enlarge accuracy reliability device . Sparing nerve bundle surgery lead decrease postoperative morbidity rate .</brief_summary>
