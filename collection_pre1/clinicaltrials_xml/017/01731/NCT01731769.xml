	<brief_summary>Axillary dissection standard treatment breast cancer patient positive node . However , seroma formation axillary dissection remain common early complication breast cancer surgery . It delay initiation adjuvant therapy , predispose wound infection , delay wound heal also link arm lymphoedema . Based study experience vacuum assist closure （VAC）is effective complex wound failures follow axillary dissection groin dissection , use VAC prevent seroma formation extensive axillary dissection . This study aim evaluate efficacy , safety economics benefit early VAC application postoperative complication wound heal extensive axillary dissection comparison conventional suction drain .</brief_summary>
