	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Dexamethasone With/Without Stem Cell Transplant Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma malignant plasma cell proliferative disorder responsible 11 , 000 death year United States . Approximately one third myeloma patient develop hypercalcemia two third present anemia . As second common hematologic malignancy , myeloma remain incurable . In last forty year , option therapy include melphalan-prednisone , anthracyclines , vinca alkaloid ; however , relapse regimen continue inevitable median survival 3 year .</detailed_description>
