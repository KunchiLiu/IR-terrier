	<brief_summary>Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) poorly understood chronic disorder unknown etiology consist irritative bladder symptom pelvic pain dramatically affect quality life . Preclinical study data ( obtain use IC/PBS model Sprague-Dawley female rat ) demonstrate normalization urinary frequency indicate LP may potent protectant bladder mucosa inflammation irritation . Intravesical LP far demonstrate excellent safety profile minimal toxicity concentration 2 mg/ml . Thus , hypothesize intravesical instillation LP may form molecular film bladder ulcer surface patient IC provide safe , effective , minimally invasive treatment option alleviate symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravesical Liposomes Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome ( IC/PBS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liposomes ( LP ) , treatment article proposal , discover process explore `` control '' compound measure efficacy liposomally encapsulate capsaicin intravesical treatment interstitial cystitis . Liposomes lipid vesicle compose concentric phospholipid bilayers , enclose aqueous interior . Liposomes ability form molecular film cell tissue surface currently test possible therapeutic agent promote wound heal . Application liposomes wound surface provide moist protective film wound augments wound heal without chronic inflammatory reaction neodermal layer .</detailed_description>
