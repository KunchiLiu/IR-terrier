	<brief_title>A Study Sunitinib Versus Placebo Combination With Lanreotide Patients With Progressive Advanced/Metastatic Midgut Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With exception surgery localize disease , presently lack available therapy prove survival benefit patient neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) . Available treatment option unresectable disease include use somatostatin analog , may relieve symptom related hormonal hypersecretion . The efficacy cytotoxic chemotherapy patient metastatic carcinoid tumor also limit . Combinations either streptozocin cyclophosphamide , streptozocin 5-fluorouracil , appear inactive , regimen associate substantial toxicity . Receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) implicate deregulated/ autocrine proliferation survival solid hematologic cancer cell . Sunitinib malate orally administer small molecule inhibits tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity receptor VEGF PDGF , also block signal KIT , FLT3 RET pathways . Therefore , sunitinib malate may provide opportunity novel therapeutic strategy treatment subject NET .</detailed_description>
