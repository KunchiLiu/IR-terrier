	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Currently , proven pharmacologic treatment patient acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Great interest remain use corticosteroid salvage patient severe acute lung injury early phase disease process , situation evaluate publish trial . Dexamethasone never evaluate ARDS randomize controlled fashion . HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES : The investigator hypothesize adjunctive treatment intravenous dexamethasone patient establish ARDS might change pulmonary systemic inflammatory response thereby increase number ventilator-free day decrease extremely high overall mortality . Our goal examine effect dexamethasone length duration mechanical ventilation ( assessed number ventilator-free day ) mortality , patient admit network Spanish intensive care unit ( ICUs ) still meet ARDS criterion 24 hour ARDS onset .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) inflammatory disease process lung response direct indirect insult , characterize clinically severe hypoxemia , reduce lung compliance , bilateral radiographic infiltrates . ARDS cause insult alveolar-capillary membrane result increase permeability subsequent interstitial alveolar edema . The mechanisms wide variety insult lead syndrome clear . It useful think pathogenesis ARDS result two different pathway : direct insult lung cell indirect insult result acute systemic inflammatory response . Like form inflammation , acute lung injury ARDS represent complex process multiple cellular signalling pathway propagate inhibit lung injury . Death traditionally attribute underlying disease , presence sepsis failure vital organ system lung . The association ARDS multiple system organ dysfunction inevitable , certainly common . It postulate local injury lung ( pneumonia , trauma , aspiration , gas inhalation ) could set secondary diffuse inflammatory response result damage organ . Although much evolve understanding pathogenesis factor affect patient outcome , still specific pharmacologic treatment ARDS . Despite advance supportive measure antibiotic , ARDS mortality rate 40-50 % series associate significant health care cost . Patients ARDS invariably require endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation ( MV ) decrease work breathe improve oxygen transport . To date proven , widely accept method MV ARDS call `` lung protective ventilation '' use low tidal volume strategy plus positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) . Corticoids seem ideal therapy acute lung injury ARDS , give potent anti-inflammatory antifibrotic property . They switch gene encode pro-inflammatory cytokine switch gene encode anti-inflammatory cytokine . It report low dos corticosteroids prevent extend cytokine response might accelerate resolution pulmonary systemic inflammation pneumonia . Dexamethasone never evaluate ARDS randomize controlled fashion . However , dexametasone potent anti-inflammatory effect weak mineralocorticoid effect compare corticosteroid . Dexamethasone long-lasting effect , allow once-a-day regimen . Whether addition dexamethasone conventional supportive treatment benefit ARDS patient unknown , use patient sepsis , septic shock , pneumonia , trauma , meningitis , cause ARDS . The investigator justify need study base positive result two recent clinical trial : ( ) Meijvis et al ( Lancet 2011 ) show dexamethasone ( 5 mg/day ) 4 day able reduce length hospital stay 304 patient bacterial pneumonia add conventional treatment ; ( ii ) Azoulay et al ( Eur Respir J 2011 ) show dexamethasone ( 10 mg/6h ) , add chemotherapy conventional ICU management , cause less respiratory deterioration lower ICU mortality 40 patient acute lung injury result leukaemia .</detailed_description>
