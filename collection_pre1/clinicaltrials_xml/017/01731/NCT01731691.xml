	<detailed_description>This study protocol design investigate benefit well-tolerated , FDA approve biological product extensively used different patient population . For 20 year , α1proteinase inhibitor ( α1PI α1antitrypsin ) therapy standard treatment people insufficient α1PI blood level . This disorder , also know α1antitrypsin deficiency , previously think cause inherited trait due gene PIzz . Recent evidence show also acquire disease . Specifically , individual HIV-1 disease find severely low α1PI blood level ( Bristow et al. , 2001 ; Bristow et al. , 2010 ; Bristow et al. , 2012 ) . Many people inherited version α1PI deficiency eventually develop emphysema , among individual HIV-1 disease , 90 % acquire α1PI deficiency . Whether go develop emphysema still unresolved . HIV-1 infected individual first patient population identify far severe α1PI deficiency acquire infection rather inherit . It find decrease α1PI blood level directly correlate decrease CD4 lymphocytes ( Bristow et al. , 2001 ; Bristow et al. , 2012 ) : In pilot study determine whether α1PI therapy might benefit CD4 count HIV-1 infected patient ( Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01370018 ) , HIV-1 patient infection-related α1PI deficiency receive weekly α1PI therapy ( 120mg/kg ) period 8 week result compare patient inherited version α1PI deficiency simultaneously receive weekly α1PI therapy ( 60mg/kg ) . None patient study ever previously receive α1PI therapy . It find CD4 cell rise normal level follow 2 week intravenous α1PI therapy adverse effect observe HIV-1 patient ( n=3 ) control group HIV-1 uninfected , α1PI deficiency patient ( n=2 ) . The new crop CD4 cell functional , capable fight infection , appear generate bone marrow-derived stem cell ( Bristow et al. , 2010 ) . As bonus , find HIV-1 patient LDL level ( bad cholesterol ) decrease HDL level ( good cholesterol ) increase { Bristow et al. , review ) . The information gain initial pilot study incorporate study design characterize mechanism lymphocyte renewal increase number patient observe . Only minor modification pilot protocol propose include sample size , addition volunteer receive therapy , double-blind design : Ten ( 10 ) HIV-1 infected patient dose PROLASTIN®-C ( Grifols Therapeutics Inc. ) , five ( 5 ) dose placebo , five ( 5 ) uninfected volunteer receive therapy monitor . It observe CD4 count cholesterol level correlate cyclic variation individual without HIV . To examine whether difference due HIV infection cyclic variation CD4 count , cholesterol level , value monitor study , five ( 5 ) volunteer , HIV , include study blood collection . In previous study , determine individual abnormally low active α1PI level , CD4 count exhibit sinusoidal cycling 23 day periodicity . Wave form appearance CD4 cell peak every 23 day pattern indicative adult thymopoiesis . We show response α1PI therapy , HIV infect uninfected individual exhibit increase CD4 count axis oscillation , change periodicity . In contrast , one uninfected individual receiving therapy , exhibit change axis oscillation , periodicity 27 day . Human adult thymopoiesis well characterize , base result , two hypothesis . One hypothesis response α1PI therapy , thymopoiesis increase , manifest increase axis oscillation increase number recent thymic emigrant . In proposed study , perform weekly TREC analysis measure recent thymic emigrant definitive thymopoiesis . We test whether change TREC number corresponds change CD4 count axis oscillation HIV infect individual receive α1PI therapy compare HIV infected individual abnormally low active α1PI level α1PI therapy , HIV uninfected individual normal active α1PI level α1PI therapy . The second hypothesis individual abnormally low active α1PI level , periodicity CD4 count short individual normal active α1PI level . Although measure periodicity 5 individual normal active α1PI level 15 abnormal active α1PI level , allow u determine whether active α1PI linear determinate periodicity whether variable regulate periodicity . In 8-week study , 2 period observe . Thus , follow 8-week regimen therapy , one study subject may ask continue second 8-week regimen therapy allow observation 5 period . In addition two primary hypothesis regard CD4 count , find HDL LDL level linearly dependent balance active inactive α1PI level ( manuscript review ) . This phenomenon due transport HDL LDL CD4 cell . We find HIV infected individual abnormally low active α1PI abnormally high inactive α1PI , HDL LDL increase decrease differently individual normal active α1PI . Based result , hypothesis HIV infect individual abnormally low active α1PI receive α1PI therapy , LDL level decrease HDL level increase active α1PI level increase contrast HIV uninfected individual normal active α1PI level therapy contrast HIV infect individual abnormally low active α1PI level therapy . Prolastin-C treatment give weekly eight ( 8 ) sixteen ( 16 ) week intravenous infusion . Blood collect immediately prior infusion . As previous study , complete blood count , lymphocyte phenotype , extend lymphocyte phenotype , lymphocyte function ; HIV-1 viral load , lipid level , blood chemistry , marker inflammation measure . The present study also include measurement HIV-1 tropism marker recent thymic emigrant .</detailed_description>
