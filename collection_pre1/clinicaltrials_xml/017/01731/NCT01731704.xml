	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Outcomes In Patients Treated With Radiotherapy For Five Or More Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize control study neurocognitive outcome patient five brain metastasis treat stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , specifically Gamma Knife ( GK ) system , whole-brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . The goal study enroll 120 patient least five ( ≥5 ) newly-diagnosed brain metastasis non-melanoma , except melanoma patient BRAF V600E B-Raf protein mutation , primary cancer large intracranial tumor volume ≤10 cc , ≤15 cc total tumor volume , absence leptomeningeal disease MRI , Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) score ≥70 ( unless due intracranial disease ) , KPS expect improve ≥70 treatment . All study participant undergo standard , pre-treatment clinical evaluation include : complete clinical/neurologic exam , performance status assessment , systemic staging , diagnostic MRI brain . The baseline neurocognitive function ( NCF ) assess short ( 20-30 minute ) online test battery complete patient home . All study participant randomize receive radiosurgical whole-brain radiation treatment brain metastasis . All patient treatment response assessment every 10-12 week consist clinical/neurologic exam , performance status evaluation , disease re-staging ( indicate ) , diagnostic MRI brain . If progressive disease identify ( radiographic progression treat lesion new brain lesion ) , patient consider `` salvage '' therapy primarily consist SRS , WBRT , surgery±brachytherapy best supportive care ( e.g . steroid ) . The preferred salvage therapy SRS provide re-treatment criterion meet . The NCF follow-up start 2 week completion initial SRS treatment repeat 2-week interval , irrespective salvage therapy may indicate . All study participant follow death withdrawal study . The primary aim study compare change neurocognitive outcome baseline 6 month survive patient upfront WBRT versus SRS treatment group . The primary study endpoint neurocognitive function measure significant change online neurocognitive function ( oNCF ) z-score baseline 6 month . The outcome compare initial treatment repeatedly follow-up , include impact salvage SRS treatment . This approach allow u assess relative impact neurocognitive outcome repeat SRS treatment sit new brain metastasis . Since SRS WBRT two different form treatment ( single high-dose treatment vs. multiple low-dose treatment ) markedly different target volume , expect local control rate also markedly different . This , turn , impact salvage therapy associate cost . This study evaluate local control rate overall intracranial disease control 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month function initial treatment cohort ( SRS vs. WBRT ) . We also expect significant difference treatment group patient caregiver report quality life ( QoL ) measure . It also expect SRS cohort require multiple SRS treatment course study since , unlike WBRT , treatment target gross brain metastasis address microscopic ( clinically undetectable ) disease . Conversely , WBRT expect result inferior control rate gross metastatic disease , increase likelihood subsequent SRS salvage therapy . For reason , track actual cost treatment course study , include need supportive care ability patient continue work previous occupation . The structure current study provide unique opportunity explore various dosimetric SRS parameter set multiple brain metastasis . Dose-volume criterion SRS establish prospective RTOG 90-05 dose-finding study subsequently validate RTOG 95-08 , randomize control trial WBRT±SRS patient 1-3 brain metastasis . Several single-institution series well multi-institutional retrospective analysis support use single-dose SRS treatment brain metastasis ; however , dose-volume criterion prescription guideline know set ≥5 brain metastasis dose interaction among different lesion target much likely . These interaction potentially lead increase rate radiation necrosis , SRS dose arbitrarily reduce concern , potentially decreased local control rate . These parameter closely track study aim establish evidence-based dosimetric guideline radiosurgical treatment multiple ( ≥5 ) brain metastasis . The data gain study could help define patient selection treatment criterion SRS multiple brain metastases potential alternative WBRT select group patient . This also first study kind use online neurocognitive assessment primary endpoint demonstrate feasibility cost-effectiveness approach multi-institutional setting .</detailed_description>
