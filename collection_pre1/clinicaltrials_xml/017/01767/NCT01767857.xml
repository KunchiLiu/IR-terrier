	<brief_title>A Phase III Study Xilonix Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In set refractory , metastatic disease complete resolution tumor burden reasonable expectation . Instead , primary goal anti-tumor therapy stage eliminate reduce symptomatic effect tumor , try prolong survival long possible . Due treatment related morbidity however , treatment modality ideal objective . Even recent target agent ( multi-kinase inhibitor ) , drug relate toxicity frequently lead relatively short treatment duration . With discontinuation therapy , disease progression uncontrolled prognosis poor . New agent control disease progression—while improve tumor-related symptom , rather cause significant therapy relate morbidity—are vitally need treat patient advance cancer , include colorectal cancer . An approach take develop agent use monoclonal antibody block chronic inflammation involve malignant disease progression constitutional symptom . Xilonix™ expect inhibit tumor growth metastasis interrupt crucial signal drive angiogenesis invasiveness . The antibody therapy may also block tumor microenvironment infiltration leukocyte ( myeloid suppressor cell ) suppress antitumor immunity , enable good host immune control disease . In addition local effect tumor , Xilonix™ expect work systemically correct metabolic dysregulation , fatigue anxiety mediate chronic inflammatory signal central nervous system .</detailed_description>
