	<brief_summary>This open-label , multi-center , dose-finding Phase 1 study enroll subject least 18 year old unresectable metastatic melanoma BRAF V600 mutation . The primary objective study describe safety doublet therapy ( dabrafenib ipilimumab ) triplet therapy ( dabrafenib/trametinib ipilimumab ) . Preliminary efficacy data also collect . Subjects assign receive either doublet combination ( dabrafenib ipilimumab ) triplet combination ( dabrafenib , trametinib , ipilimumab ) . Subjects enrol dose-finding cohort doublet combination ( dabrafenib + ipilimumab ) sequential 3+3 fashion . Following establishment dose doublet combination , expansion cohort open . At time , enrollment dose find cohort triplet combination ( dabrafenib + trametinib + ipilimumab ) begin sequential 6+6 fashion . Enrollment triplet cohort take priority doublet expansion arm triplet dose-finding arm open enrollment time . Approximately 9-24 subject enrol dose find portion study . Approximately 30 subject enrol doublet expansion cohort 30 subject enrol triplet expansion cohort . A two-week run-in period without ipilimumab follow 4 intravenous dos ipilimumab recommend dose schedule . Oral daily dose dabrafenib dabrafenib + trametinib continue two-week run-in , combination ipilimumab , post-ipilimumab longer clinical benefit , opinion treat physician , unacceptable AE death</brief_summary>
