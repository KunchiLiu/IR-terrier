	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study cryosurgery radiation therapy treat patient painful bone metastasis . Cryosurgery kill tumor cell freeze . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving cryosurgery together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryosurgery Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Painful Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess potential efficacy safety combine percutaneous compute tomography ( CT ) -guided cryoablation radiotherapy palliation osseous metastasis . OUTLINE : Patients undergo cryosurgery . Beginning 2 week later , patient undergo 1 , 10 , 15 fraction radiation therapy 5 day per week 1-3 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 hour week 1-2 , 4 , 12 , 18 , 24 .</detailed_description>
