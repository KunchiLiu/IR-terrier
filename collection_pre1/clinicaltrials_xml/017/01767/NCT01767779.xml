	<brief_summary>To determine whether EEGs infancy reliable biomarker identify TSC patient develop infantile spasms/epilepsy near future thus appropriate candidate antiepileptogenic drug trial . Since patient TSC develop epilepsy , would useful biomarker could predict patient destine epilepsy thus identify TSC patient appropriate antiepileptogenic drug trial . A recent study suggest treat TSC patient abnormal EEG prior onset infantile spasm vigabatrin may improve neurological outcome , use EEG reliable biomarker future epilepsy rigorously validate . In specific aim , test reliability EEG predict future development infantile spasm epilepsy TSC patient first year life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current therapeutic approach epilepsy primarily represent symptomatic treatment suppress seizure , demonstrate prevent epilepsy modify disease progression . In recent year , tremendous interest effort basic scientist clinician epilepsy develop disease-modifying `` antiepileptogenic '' therapy . However , effort hinder couple significant limitation : 1 ) difficulty identify appropriate high-risk patient population preventative approach feasible justifiable , 2 ) lack appropriate drug target antiepileptogenic property . Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) one common genetic cause epilepsy subset TSC patient may represent rational , feasible population target antiepileptogenic approach several reason . First , patient diagnose TSC young age onset epilepsy due non-neurological finding - thus , feasible identify patient initiate potential antiepileptogenic treatment early stage epileptogenesis . Second , patient high risk develop epilepsy ( ~80 % ) future , include infantile spasm ( ~35 % ) , particularly devastate type childhood epilepsy poor prognosis - thus , initiate therapy potential side effect pre-symptomatic stage likely justified TSC patient . Finally , identification mTOR pathway pathophysiology TSC suggest mTOR inhibitor could antiepileptogenic property TSC , already support pre-clinical animal study - thus , rational mechanistically-based treatment potentially already exist readily test TSC patient . However , may significant risk side effect mTOR inhibitor , especially early childhood , chronic immunosuppression theoretical effect learn , growth , development . Thus , initiate antiepileptogenic drug trial TSC patient , would beneficial obtain evidence optimize selection criterion treatment paradigm maximize efficacy minimize side effect mTOR inhibitor . The aim clinical trial determine whether EEGs infancy reliable biomarker identify TSC patient develop infantile spasms/epilepsy near future thus appropriate candidate antiepileptogenic drug trial .</detailed_description>
