	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome ( PFS ) present clinic offer opportunity participate study . If consent study randomize 2 treatment group . The experimental treatment group treat accord novel PFS treatment algorithm . The control group receive treatment would consider standard physical therapy care . To apply standard physical therapy care standardized manner investigator use multimodal treatment approach previously show Lowry beneficial treatment PFS . Both group subject see 2 time per week maximum 12 visit . Patients discharge early longer report pain impaired function Anterior Knee Pain scale . The purpose study see patient patellofemoral pain syndrome treated experimental Patellofemoral treatment algorithm experience significant improvement function , pain number treatment session compare previously research multimodal approach treatment patellofemoral pain . The secondary objective study examine result determine full randomize control clinical trial PFS algorithm justify . The investigator hypothesize utilization Patellofemoral syndrome treatment algorithm evaluation treatment patient diagnose PFS lead significant improvement function , pain number treatment session compare previously research treatment PFS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Evaluation Novel Treatment Algorithm Patients With Patellofemoral Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refer physical therapy diagnosis Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome offer opportunity participate study . After explain study answer patient parent question , informed consent obtain individual wish participate . The participant screen see meet inclusion criterion , randomly assign either evaluation treatment use novel PFS treatment algorithm ( experimental group ) evaluation treatment use multimodal approach PFS . The evaluating therapist take measurement perform treatment patient , blind group allocation . The patient make aware experimental control group , blind treatment receive . Multimodal approach PFS : Patients randomize control treatment group treat manner consistent treatment approach previously describe literature find effective treat Patellofemoral Syndrome . Multimodal PFS Evaluation Postural Exam - Lower Extremity ( LE ) Alignment - Pelvic Rotation - Navicular Drop Neurodynamic Testing - Straight Leg Raise ( SLR ) Muscle Flexibility - 90/90 Hamstring ( -20 degree consider positive ) - Quadriceps length ( Elys test ) - Standing gastrocnemius length - Prone Piriformis length - Supine Modified Thomas Test - Ober 's Test AROM/PROM - Hip - Knee - Great Toe Dorsiflexion ( DF ) - Ankle DF - Calcaneal/forefoot Valgus Manual Muscle Testing ( MMT ) ( describe kendall ) - Gluteus maximus - Gluteus Medius - Quadriceps - Hamstrings - Hip Internal Rotation ( IR ) - Hip External Rotation ( ER ) Accessory Motions ( find restrict motion , pain . Used guide manual treatment ) - Posterior Anterior ( PA ) glide Lumbar Spine - Hip - Patella - Tibiofemoral joint Abdominal Recruitment -Palpated Abdominal Drawing-in maneuver ( hook lie position ) Special Tests -Patellar Compression Test Functional Tests - Squat - Step test ( Forward 8 inch step ) Treatment use Multimodal Approach Manual Therapy prior Exercise - Lumbopelvic thrust ( Used great 15 degree prone hip IR notice side . Up 2 manipulation per side 2 treatment . ) - Caudal hip non-thrust manipulation ( Used restriction notice accessory motion pain hip Range Motion ( ROM ) start session . ) - Patellar mobilization ( Inferior patellar joint mobilization use -patellar compression test . Otherwise use limited motion . ) - Proximal Tibiofibular Manipulation ( Used restriction motion notice side , patient experience pain knee flexion . ) Treatment modality -Patellar Taping ( Patient tap first 3 week therapy ) McConnell Medial Patellar Taping attempt patient report pain functional step test . Taping use intervention patient report decrease pain least 2/10 functional step test tap Orthotics -Patient fit issued orthotics &gt; 3mm drop navicular drop test note Non Weight Bearing Exercise ( Patient able perform Non Weight Bearing ( WB ) exercise properly progress WB ) - Abdominal isometric brace hook lie - Abdominal bracing heel slide - Abdominal bracing bent knee lift - Abdominal bracing straight-leg raise - Bridging ( Patient hook lie ask perform abdominal bracing , lift gluteal muscle table ) - Side-lying clamshell ( Patient sidelying , hip knee flex 45 degree . ) - Quadruped Upper Extremity LE lift ( Patient quadruped ask perform abdominal bracing . ) - Quadruped Hip abduction ( Patient quadruped ask perform abdominal bracing ) - Quadruped Hip extension ( Patient quadruped ask perform abdominal bracing ) Weight Bearing Exercises ( Must able complete 2 set 10 without substitution non WB exercise ) - Double Leg Press ( Total gym/Shuttle ) - Single Leg Press ( Total gym/Shuttle ) - Eccentric Step-Downs ( Forward Use 4inch step ) - Eccentric Step-Downs ( Lateral Use 4inch step ) - Hip abduction sidestepping ( Knees hips slight flexed theraband ankle ) - Squats - Lunge - Clock Balance Reach ( functional star ) Stretches 3 set 30 second hold ( performed tightness find ) - Supine piriformis stretch - Supine Gluteus figure-four stretch - Standing hamstring stretch - Standing quad stretch - Standing Iliotibial band Stretch - Standing gastrocnemius stretch PFS treatment algorithm : The PFS treatment algorithm objective goal drive treatment program . Treatment therapist discretion objective meet requirement subgroup . Evidence literature guide treatment best meet goal . The first group within classification system Fear Avoidance , research show change fear-avoidance belief physical activity one best predictor improve functional outcome . The second group Flexibility . This second group system research show patient decreased flexibility unable properly perform functional malalignment test . Also quadriceps length gastrocnemius/soleus length strongly associate PFS . The third group Functional Malalignment . This group assess patient 's form functional task . If patient demonstrates impaired mechanic , time spent strengthen motor control patient able strengthen return full function proper technique . The final group Strengthening/Return Function . This group work strengthen low quarter muscle particular attention quadriceps , hip abductor external rotators . This also time progress patient back sport functional activity . -Fear Avoidance Belief Questionaire ( A score 15 great questionaire result give PFS fear avoidance booklet treatment use Cognitive Behavioral emphasis ) Primary Muscle Flexibility Requirements ( Not meet 1 flexibility measure result place flexibility subgroup ) - Quadriceps ≥ 130 degree - Gastrocnemius ≥ 12 degree - Soleus ≥ 20 degree - WB DF ≥ 50 degree Secondary Muscle Flexibility ( Having tightness least 3 follow test result place flexibility subgroup ) - Thomas test - Ober 's Test - Hamstring SLR ≥ 80 degree - Adductor Flexibility Functional Malalignment ( Score great 1 result place functional malalignment subgroup ) - Lateral Step Down test - Single Leg Squat test Strengthening/Functional Progression ( A limb symmetry index score &gt; =90 % test use determine adequate LE strength function ) - Single Hop Test - Triple Hop Test - Crossover Hop Distance test - Timed Step Down test</detailed_description>
