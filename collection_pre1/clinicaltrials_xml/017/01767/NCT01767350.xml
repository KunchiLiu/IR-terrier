Clinical study demonstrate good control drug exposure improve outcome . A large set patient characteristic appear important determine dose requirement adult , particular genetic variation gene involve drug metabolism .

	<brief_title>Determinants Immunosuppressive Dose Requirements Children After Solid Organ Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success solid organ transplantation important part determine potency immunosuppressive regime prevent allograft rejection . Depending type organ transplanted current 5-year graft survival liver circa 70 % kidney almost 80 % ( 1-3 ) . Although acute rejection become less problem , analyse data follow-up solid organ recipient demonstrate long-term allograft survival improve much last decade . The life expectancy donor organ appear limited due phenomenon chronic , antibody mediate , rejection toxic effect immunosuppressive medication . Unfortunately , commonly apply immunosuppressive agent ( particular calcineurin-inhibitors ) posse narrow therapeutic index potential severe consequence drug under- overexposure . Furthermore , clinical practice optimal dose difficult achieve due important inter- intraindividual variation drug pharmacokinetics . Consequently attention shift towards design `` tailor immunosuppressive maintenance therapy '' , aim optimization drug efficacy prevention unintended possible deleterious side effect individual recipient . For `` perfect fit '' entail fundamental knowledge individual characteristic recipient graft relation pharmacodynamic -kinetic property agent . A complex often interdependent set factor appear relevant determine drug exposure . These include recipient characteristic age , race , body composition , organ function ( intestine-liver-kidney ) , food concomitant medication intake , also graft-related characteristic : seize , donor-age , time transplantation . Longitudinal cross-sectional analysis clinical genetic co-variables allograft recipient cohort identify several single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene encode enzyme transporter involve drug metabolism ( CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , MDR1 ) , associate difference dose toxicity ( 4-10 ) . In particular carrier common polymorphism CYP3A5 ( designate CYP3A5*1 ) demonstrate 25-40 % increase tacrolimus clearance 2-3 fold increase dose requirement . In child dose requirement per kg bodyweight attain desire blood concentration approximately 2.7 fold high patient 5 year 1.9 fold high patient age 5 12 year compare old patients11-14 . Age-related difference expression enzymes transporter involve drug metabolism might play important role . Fakhoury et al demonstrated increase intestinal CYP3A4/5 mRNA protein expression childhood adulthood ( 15 ) . In addition factor intestinal transit time length , body composition , protein binding , body metabolism organ function , might important determine dose requirement child ( 16-18 ) . The importance aforementioned genetic polymorphism long-term dose requirement study child . Objective : To describe dose requirement immunosuppressive medication relation set clinical non-clinical ( genetic ) factor cohort pediatric recipient solid organ allograft . Methods : A retrospective study single center ( University Hospitals Leuven ) active program pediatric kidney , liver intestinal transplantation . The study population consist subject receive solid organ transplant ( liver , kidney , intestine , combine ) 0 18 year age . As part standard care patient admit department yearly check-up transplantation . During admission set investigation perform evaluate current medical situation , include elaborate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessment . Patient characteristic clinical data ( age , bodyweight , sex , type graft , cause organ failure , co-medication , laboratory result , PK data ) retrieve patient file concern follow-up admission . In addition patient and/or parent request permission collect one extra tube whole blood ( ca 8 ml ) DNA analysis standard blood collection regular hospital/outpatient visit . After collection patient data give code anonymous storage analysis . DNA SNP analysis take place laboratory pediatric nephrology PCR .</detailed_description>
