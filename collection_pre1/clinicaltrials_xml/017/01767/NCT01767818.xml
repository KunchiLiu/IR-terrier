	<brief_summary>The primary objective study obtain detailed clinical information biologic specimens subject PD toward ultimate end identify biomarker PD . Because inherent difficulty use clinical outcome measure assess disease modification , identification biomarkers PD paramount importance . The ideal PD biomarker would one easily assay convenient biological sample , varies proportionally disease severity , abnormal pre-symptomatic phase illness , unaffected drug intervention use treat PD . The existence sensitive biomarker property would enable much effective disease modify research would likely able take advantage small potentially short trial .</brief_summary>
