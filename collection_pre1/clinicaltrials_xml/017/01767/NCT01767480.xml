	<brief_summary>Robot-assisted training ( RT ) device develop date significant impact stroke rehabilitation . Several research group develop robotic device examine efficacy improve upper limb function stroke . All robotic device apply stroke rehabilitation efficacy evaluate , scientific evidence mechanisms RT-induced recovery , optimal treatment intensity , impact physiological response still lack . This trial examine ( 1 ) immediate effect treatment intensity RT sensorimotor impairment functional performance patient subacute stroke ; ( 2 ) long-term benefit treatment intensity RT conduct 6-month follow evaluation ; ( 3 ) effect RT cortical/movement reorganization well physiological marker inflammation , oxidative stress , erythrocyte deformability . These overall finding help well understand efficacy RT functional outcome , brain movement reorganization , physiological marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subacute stroke participant recruit Chang Gung Memorial Hospital randomly assign 1 3 group : RT higher-intensity group , RT lower-intensity group , conventional intervention group . Assessments sensorimotor impairment ( Fugl Mayer Assessment , Motor Status Scale , Modified Ashworth Scale , Myoton , Muscle Metabolism , Box Block Test , Revised Nottingham Sensory assessment ) functional performance ( Functional Independence Measure , Motor Activity Log , ABILHAND Questionnaire , Adelaide Activities Profile , EQ-5D-5L , accelerometer ) take 40 minute complete . Evaluation brain reorganization use functional magnetic resonance image movement pattern kinematic analysis take 1 hour examination . Blood sample patient ( 12 ml . ) collect examine physiological marker ( ie , inflammation-related marker , oxidative stress marker , erythrocyte deformability ) intervention . Total 24 ml blood collect study . Except blood taking , examination non-invasive .</detailed_description>
