	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Bevacizumab Children Young Adults With NF 2 Progressive Vestibular Schwannomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects treat open-label bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week 24 week ( induction therapy ) . Clinical response assess audiology MRI week 12 24 . Subjects hear decline week 12 24 take protocol . At week 24 , patient clinical response stable disease ( together comprise `` clinical benefit '' ) transition maintenance therapy bevacizumab . During maintenance phase , subject treat open-label bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 3 week 72 week . Subjects follow audiology MRI scan every 12 week . The total time study 96 week ( 24 week induction + 72 week maintenance ) . Subjects allow increase bevacizumab dose 10 mg/kg every 2 week maintenance therapy experience hear decline maintenance therapy ( defined decrease word recognition score 95 % critical difference compare word recognition score baseline , Appendix A ) . Subjects take study word recognition score remain within 95 % critical difference receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Patients must confirm diagnosis neurofibromatosis 2 fulfilling National Institute Health ( NIH ) criteria Manchester criterion , detection causative mutation NF2 gene . Patients must measurable disease , define least one VS &gt; 1.0 ml ( volumetric analysis ) accurately measure contrastenhanced cranial MRI scan fine cut internal auditory canal ( 3 mm slice , skip ) . Age 6 year great ( upper limit ) day 1 treatment . Given potential risk longterm bevacizumab use , child age 6 eligible treatment . No upper limit adult . Life expectancy great 1 year . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Patients must creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥60ml/min/1.73 m2 normal serum creatinine base age describe table : Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) 6 &lt; 10 year 1 ( Male ) 1 ( Female ) 10 &lt; 13 year 1.2 ( Male ) 1.2 ( Female ) 13 &lt; 16 year 1.5 ( Male ) 1.4 ( Female ≥ 16 year 1.7 ( Male ) 1.4 ( Female ) Subjects must target VS follow quality : Not amenable surgery due patient refusal , high risk surgical complication ( e.g. , damage low cranial nerve function , tumor size &gt; 3 cm long diameter , multilobulated tumor appearance MRI scan ) . Associated word recognition score &lt; 85 % Documented clinical progression define EITHER : Progressive hearing loss ( defined decline word recognition score 95 % critical difference interval baseline score [ Appendix A ] related VS ( i.e. , due prior intervention surgery radiation ) OR Progressive tumor growth precede 18 month , define ≥ 20 % increase volume The effect bevacizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason bevacizumab agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent assent document . Must establish relationship primary care physician provide contact information Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Prior radiation treatment target vestibular schwannoma allow provide 3 year prior participation clinical trial . Prior radiation treatment nontarget tumor allow . Participants may receive study agent . Patients nervous system tumor associate NF2 ( e.g. , schwannomas , meningioma , ependymomas , glioma ) exclude clinical trial unless ( opinion investigator ) tumor grow likely require treatment clinical trial . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition bevacizumab . Patients know hypersensitivity Chinese hamster ovary cell product , recombinant human antibody , compound similar chemical biologic composition bevacizumab . Inability tolerate periodic MRI scan gadolinium contrast . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History arterial/myocardial disease . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease , : Inadequately control HTN ( adult : SBP &gt; 160 mmHg and/or DBP &gt; 90 mmHg despite antihypertensive medication ; child : please refer Appendix D ageappropriate value indicate ≥ Grade 2 ) History CVA within 12 month Myocardial infarction unstable angina within 12 month New York heart association grade II great congestive heart failure Serious inadequately control cardiac arrhythmia Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , history aortic dissection ) Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease Pregnant woman exclude study bevacizumab antiangiogenic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother bevacizumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated bevacizumab . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive patient cancer survivor eligible study fulfill eligibility criterion . Concurrent use anticoagulant drug ( include prophylactic dos ) , history coagulopathy , evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Imaging ( CT MRI ) evidence hemorrhage deem significant treating physician ( &gt; grade 1 ) . Subjects history CNS hemorrhage eligible . Urine protein screen urine analysis Urine Protein Creatinine ( UPC ) ratio . For UPC ratio &gt; 0.5 , 24hour urine protein obtain level &lt; 1000 mg patient enrollment . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer bone fracture . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior day 1 . Invasive procedure define follow : Major surgical procedure , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 1 therapy Brain biopsy within 28 day prior day 1 therapy ( wound must fully heal brain biopsy perform 28 day prior day 1 therapy ) Anticipation need major surgical procedure course study Core biopsy within 7 day prior D1 therapy Prior treatment bevacizumab .</criteria>
