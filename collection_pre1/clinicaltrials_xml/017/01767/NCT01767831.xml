	<brief_summary>This study combine data collection simulation-based education , enroll 36 adult T1DM already experience insulin pump therapy experience continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) . The study first track participant 3-day CGM-training period . The training period follow 1-week CGM monitoring CGM data collection period . Following 1-week CGM monitoring-only portion study , participant begin education intervention component study , refer Insight-Based Online Learning Using Simulation Education Diabetes ( iBOLUSED ) . The education intervention component 4 week length . The intervention involve daily diary data upload daily simulation-based feedback base collect diary data . During first week ( 2 week ) intervention , participant view glycemic outcome data represent participant 's hypo- hyperglycemic risk throughout day , base CGM data collect CGM monitoring period . In next 2 week intervention , participant opportunity interact internet-based system use simulation-based tool design provide insight participant regard different effect modification insulin therapy . Throughout educational intervention , participant record diary data every day use diary component internet-based system . Diary entry include data meal , physical activity , history insulin basal rate insulin bolus give day , self-reported stress level , hypo- hyperglycemic fear level , , applicable , menstrual cycle physical illness . Participants also upload data CGM via Dexcom Data Manager 3 ( DM3 ) software Dexcom Studio Software . Two assessment , one prior intervention period one follow intervention , administer gather relevant psychobehavioral information . Focus group session conduct end study , allow collection information regard effectiveness Internet intervention provide insight design future study . Parallel record CGM , insulin , behavioral data , well psychometric instrument , produce rich synchronize data set person facilitate development personalize behavioral profile employ provide individualize feedback educate participant . In particular , study test use collect diary data educate participant describe glucose profile information present relevant data regarding : ( 1 ) hypo- hyperglycemia risk zone throughout day , ( 2 ) insulin meal bolus information associate glycemic outcome index , ( 3 ) basal rate information associate glycemic outcome index .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Development insulin delivery educational tool T1DM require fundamental behavioral physiology study , well translational model engineering development . In order successful , Closed Loop Control ( CLC ) T1DM must adapt individual physiologic characteristic behavioral profile person . Here , lay foundation test educational tool aim provide feedback patient goal optimize patient 's glucose control conventional insulin therapy . This educational tool base collect data patient process algorithms give insight relationship glucose control psychobehavioral characteristic individual . This information eventually inform CLC system , initialize individual base relevant behavioral physiologic characteristic , include algorithmic observer patient ' behavior metabolic state .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For pilot trial , recruitment ONLY occur UVa 's IRBHSR # 14263 Recruitment Database . Inclusion criterion subject enroll : 1 . T1DM ( defined American Diabetes Association criterion judgment physician ) least 2 year prior enrollment study 2 . Age 2165 . 3 . Use insulin pump treat diabetes least 6 month . 4 . Use CGM least 6 week period past 2 year . 5 . Has ability use computer capable run Dexcom Data Manager 3 ( DM3 ) software daily . 6 . Has regular access Internet . 7 . Has identify healthcare provider provide advice diabetes care . 8 . Actively use bolus calculator function current insulin pump predefined parameter glucose goal , carbohydrate ratio , insulin sensitivity factor . 9 . Willingness participate study 11 week wear DexCom CGM duration study perform daily journaling BG , pump activity , meal , physical activity , stress level menstrual cycle 3 week study intervention period . 10 . Willingness extra fingersticks CGM alarm low high end ( &lt; 70 mg/dl &gt; 300 mg/dl ) , 11 . Willingness come Center Diabetes Technology least two occasion obtain return supply . 12 . Willingness avoid consumption acetaminophencontaining product duration study . 13 . Demonstration proper mental status cognition completion study . 14 . Has ability contact personal diabetes care team clinical question answer change diabetes treatment . 1 . Individuals cognitive impairment prevents understand either consent form intervention content 2 . Active renal dialysis 3 . Psychiatric disorder would interfere study task ( e.g. , substance abuse ) 4 . History systemic deep tissue infection methicillinresistant staph aureus Candida albicans 5 . Known bleed diathesis dyscrasia 6 . Pregnant intend get pregnant study 7 . Active enrollment another clinical trial 8 . Medical requirement acetaminophencontaining product study period 1 week 9 . Medical condition would make operating CGM insulin pump difficult ( e.g . blindness , severe arthritis , extensive scar tissue sit device insert ) 10 . Individuals access diabetes care team clinical question answer change diabetes treatment . 11 . Need magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) /magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRA ) study List restriction use drug treatment : The CGM must remove prior Magnetic Resonance Imaging use acetaminophencontaining medication use CGM sensor may affect performance device . Therefore , MRI product contain acetaminophen restrict . If either required medical necessity , DexComÂ® remove participant option repeat involve study week . If medical condition require use acetaminophen longer 1 week , participant drop study .</criteria>
