	<brief_summary>Patients retinal detachment always recover good visual function . Sometimes simple cause responsible . Other cause discover thanks high-resolution imaging provide late generation OCT . This study possible thanks surgical team strong recruitment potential , experience joint project 2007-2008 ( PHRC national - Etude DOREMY , Etude FRIENDS ) define strict intervention criterion . The principal objective study well define regard time : - The onset surgically curable transient macular affection , loss visual acuity qualify `` explain '' - But good understand relationship anatomical analysis obtain use OCT autofluorescence functional analysis use visual acuity microperimetry . - In near future , two technique ( OCT microperimetry ) certainly become essential tool evaluation macular function . Better understand relationship first necessary step study concern therapeutic prevention retinal lesion relate retinal detachment : This study make possible define criterion evaluation anatomical functional recovery , relationship finally evolution time . This essential first phase possible therapy evaluate .</brief_summary>
