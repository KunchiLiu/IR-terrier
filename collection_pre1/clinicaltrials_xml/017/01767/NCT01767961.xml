	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study modify barium swallow measure swallow function surgery patient oropharyngeal cancer undergone surgery . New diagnostic procedure , modify barium swallow , may effective study side effect cancer therapy patient receive treatment oropharyngeal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Barium Swallow Measuring Swallowing Function After Surgery Patients With Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare aspiration oropharyngeal carcinoma patient underwent transoral robotic surgery ( TORS ) vs. chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) via objective instrument , modify barium swallow ( MBS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare patient-perceived swallow function oropharyngeal carcinoma patient underwent TORS vs. CRT via subjective instrument , M.D . Anderson Dysphagia Inventory ( MDADI ) use total MDADI score . II . To compare patient-perceived swallow function oropharyngeal carcinoma patient underwent TORS vs. CRT via second subjective instrument , Eating Assessment Tool ( EAT-10 ) use total EAT-10 score . III . To estimate correlation maximum Penetration Aspiration Scale ( PAS ) score MDADI total score TORS CRT oropharyngeal carcinoma patient regardless treatment modality . IV . To estimate correlation maximum PAS score EAT-10 total score TORS CRT oropharyngeal carcinoma patient regardless treatment modality . V. To estimate correlation MDADI total score EAT-10 total score TORS CRT oropharyngeal carcinoma patient regardless treatment modality . VI . To estimate cervical esophageal stricture diameter TORS vs. CRT via objective instrument , MBS . OUTLINE : Patients undergo modified barium swallow , comprise swallow bolus thin liquid barium , barium honey , barium pudding , barium cracker undergo fluoroscopic imaging .</detailed_description>
