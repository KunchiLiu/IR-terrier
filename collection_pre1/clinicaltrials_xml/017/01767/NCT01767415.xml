	<brief_title>Intra-operative Use Indigo Carmine Dye Delineation Ill Defined Tumor Borders Using Stereotactic Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low grade glioma brain tumor usually poorly defined border tumor normal brain . This characteristic low grade glioma make gross total resection tumor extremely difficult . Nevertheless , several study demonstrate risk recurrence progression malignant tumor decrease aggressive surgical resection . An aggressive attempt achieve gross total resection may result resection normal brain therefore neurological injury . For reason , common error subtotally resect tumor leave significant volume tumor behind . Many technique introduce safely increase extent resection , since extent resection associate high survival rate . Each one techniques several shortcoming . The current study ass whether intraoperative stereotactic injection indigo carmine tumor margin help safely increase extent tumor resection . In first step study safety correlation resection stain tissue/extend tumor resection assess . If result satisfactory , second step ensue . In second step assess utility indigo carmine additional adjunct guide tumor resection .</detailed_description>
