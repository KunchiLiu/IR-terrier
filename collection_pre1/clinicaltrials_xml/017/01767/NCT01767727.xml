	<brief_summary>Multiple finger defect common hand trauma result functional disability . These injury often complex severe , thus reconstructive alternative limit . In study , use dorsal homodigital island flap , base dorsal branch digital artery , reconstruction multiple finger defect . At final follow-up , would evaluate efficacy technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At final follow-up , sensation flap donor site would assess use static two-point discrimination Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test . The range motion proximal interphalangeal joint distal interphalangeal joint injure finger measure goniometer . The cold intolerance injure finger measure use self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire rat mild , moderate , severe , extreme . The pain injured finger donor site give subjectively patient use visual analogue scale , range 0 10 cm groupes mild ( 0-3 cm ) , moderate ( 4-6 cm ) severe ( 7-10 cm ) .</detailed_description>
