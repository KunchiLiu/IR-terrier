	<detailed_description>A significant portion patient cardiac disease like coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) develop ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) . These arrhythmia often cause symptom like dizziness , shortness breath , angina even cardiogenic shock . Large trial show VTs associate 3.4 5fold increase mortality even episode successfully terminate ICD . Initially patient treat antiarrhythmic . If drug ineffective tolerate side effect catheter ablation ( obliteration cardiac tissue radiofrequency ) alternative therapy . The mechanism VTs reentry circuit typically find area scar leave right chamber . These scar area may locate inner layer myocardium ( endocardial ) , out layer ( epicardial ) layer heart muscle ( transmural ) . The standard ablation procedure carry endocardial . This mean catheter introduce femoral vein artery place right left ventricle . In 30 % patient treated way successful ablation possible . In case scar area mostly locate outer layer myocardium . Ablation feasible catheter place epicardial space reach surface heart muscle . In past type ablation perform second procedure case recurrent VTs unsuccessful endocardial ablation . This prospective randomize trial compare standard ablation procedure ( endocardial ablation ) new strategy . This mean single procedure scar area responsible VT mark obliterate endocardial well epicardial . The primary endpoint recurrence VT endo- epicardial vs. endocardial ablation . Patients eligible show document VT basis underlie cardiac disease therapy antiarrhythmic ineffective tolerate . In term study cardiac disease mean CAD , DCM ARVC . All patient treat ICD . Patients eligible VT document , structural heart disease , mechanical aortic valve pacemaker/ICD epicardial lead implant pericardial puncture must do . 40 patient enrol . They randomize 1:1 study arm `` strategy 1 '' standard endocardial ablation `` strategy 2 '' endo- epicardial ablation . In case strategy 1 ablation catheter place right , leave ventricles femoral veins/arteries . VT induce programmed stimulation analyse . By mean 3D-electroanatomical map endocardial surface reconstruct . The scar area mark second step obliterate . In case strategy 2 addition endocardial access via femoral veins/arteries pericardial puncture perform get access epicardial space . This allow placement ablation catheter epicardial surface heart . VT induce analysed endo- epicardial . In addition strategy 1 3D-reconstruction epicardial surface make scar area mark like endocardial . In first step endocardial ablation perform . Thereafter change epicardial scar area analyze . In case still inducible VT endocardial ablation epicardial ablation perform second step . The success strategy 1 2 always check programmed ventricular stimulation . At least 12 month plan enrollment . The study close patient last enrolled complete 12-months-follow . Follow visit schedule 3 , 6 12 month ablation procedure . Recurrence VT monitor ICD interrogation . Both ablation strategy well established conduct standard equipment . The methodology study contain experimental approach . The standard insurance coverage hospital guarantee enrolled patient .</detailed_description>
