	<brief_title>Can Creatine Supplementation Improve Body Composition Physical Function Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background aim Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient typically experience significant loss muscle . This reduce ability complete daily task increase disability , well increase risk infection illness . Exercise effective increase muscle size strength , time consuming , expensive hard work , mean uptake poor . So , widely acceptable alternative require . The study aim test food supplement call creatine . Creatine , often find meat fish , make essential part system provide energy muscle movement exercise . The creatine provide fruit flavour powder participant mix water drink , much like fruit squash . In healthy individual , food supplementation creatine ( Cr ) increase muscle size improve physical function quality life . The aim study investigate whether RA patient may benefit similarly Who participant ? 50 patient stable controlled RA , age 18 , know kidney problem . What study involve ? 50 participant give food supplement take 12 week ; supplement either creatine placebo ( regular fruit flavour powder benefit ) . Participants randomly allocate group tell supplement take end trial . The supplement take drink 4 time day first 5 day , day remainder 12 week . Participants ask attend Bangor University 4 time series test do . The four test point : 1. start supplementation 2. 5 day 3. completion 12-weeks supplementation 4 . 12 week completion 12 week supplementation period . At four test point ( 1-4 ) body fat muscle size ( body composition ) , physical function , fitness ( aerobic capacity heart lungs transport oxygen exercise muscle ) test . In addition , quality life questionnaire complete , disease activity assess blood sample take . Muscle sample ( muscle biopsy ) obtain , volunteer provide , baseline post-treatment ( test point 1 3 ) . Body fat muscle size ( body composition ) assess use type X-ray call 'dual-entry X-ray absorptiometry ' ( DXA ) scan look body water level . DXA allow research team estimate amount lean tissue ( muscle ) fat body . The scan completely painless . Physical function assess use follow test : 1. strength test knee muscle hand-grip 2. Up-and-Go Test ( UG ) - For UG , participant require rise seat position fix chair , walk forward cone place 8ft ( 2.44 ) away , return chair seat position . 3. sit-to-stand 30 sec test ( SST-30 ) - For SST-30 participant rise seat position UG many time possible 30 whilst keep arm fold across chest . 4 . 50-ft walk test - During 50-ft walk test , time take complete walk along straight line mark cone record 5 . To assess fitness participant complete step test . During test participant require step 10-inch step tempo control metronome three x three-minute stage target heart rate ( 65 % predict maximum heart rate ) achieve . This test normally last 3 minute What potential risk benefit ? Risks - A disadvantage take part time commitment require participate study . Whilst take supplement drink quick simple , 4 test session may 2 hour participant must attend Bangor University . Any travel expense participant incur participate study pay . Creatine supplementation cause weight gain ; short-term due water retention muscle long-term due increase muscle size . Previous research , include research RA patient , find adverse side effect link creatine supplementation . There anecdotal report creatine supplementation cause muscle cramp , stomach heart problem ; however evidence ever link directly creatine . There also slight possibility muscle biopsy site ( muscle take ) could bruise sore quite rare fact people report short term slight ache biopsy . There also exposure radiation ( emission energy ) DXA scan , though small amount . However , radiation pregnant woman allow part study . Benefits - Taking creatine supplement increase muscle strength improve physical function quality life . Participants receive creatine supplementation regardless group initially put . Participants also inform fitness level receive advice improve . The standard DXA inform investigaters disease bone increase risk fracture ( osteoporosis ) patient might know . Who run study long last ? The study commence January 2012 undertaken School Sport , Health Exericse Sciences ( SSHES ) Bangor University , Wales , association Rheumatology department Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital , Bangor . Who fund study ? The study fund Betsi Cadwalader University Health Board . The study expect finish within 18 month time frame , recruit open year 50 patient find . Who main contact ?
