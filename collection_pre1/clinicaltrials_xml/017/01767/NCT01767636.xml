	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer patient assess overall survival rate 12 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate best tumor response end first two treatment cycle pazopanib non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer patient . II . To determine benefit pazopanib increase progression free survival time . III . To describe toxicity profile pazopanib non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
