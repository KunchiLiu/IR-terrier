	<brief_summary>Background : Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) under-recognized under-treated primary care office primary care physician generally familiar treatment guideline . Even diagnose properly , chronic condition CKD frequently associate co-morbidities make effective treatment difficult due complexity care . Availability Clinical Decision Support ( CDS ) CKD may help promote effective , evidence-based care , evidence suggest CDS alone may sufficient quality improvement intervention CDS plus practice facilitation may need . Purpose : The project aim : 1 ) ass viability CDS implement evidence-based guideline Primary Care Practices ( PCPs ) 2 ) develop evidence-based practice guideline PCPs may use enhance care provide difficult manage segment healthcare population . Methods : This randomize controlled trial point-of-care CDS plus full TRANSLATE model practice change , versus CDS alone . The study aim analyze difference promote evidence-based care primary care practice . Thirty-six practice recruit study . Patient inclusion criterion : adult patient estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 60 &gt; 15ml/min/1.73m2 confirm repeat test three month . A process evaluation conduct CDS practice facilitation CDS practice assess clinical outcome CKD progression all-cause mortality . Lastly , cost-effective analysis compare cost-to-benefit ratio CDS alone CDS plus TRANSLATE ( i.e . practice facilitation ) relation cost per quality adjust year life . This study fund NIH NIDDK R01 mechanism start 07/01/2011 end 06/30/2016 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose trial test extent CDS plus facilitation promote evidence-based care improve clinical outcome reduce disease progression mortality primary care practice . We also conduct observational comparative effectiveness analysis data large database electronic medical record order identify successful component evidence-based care respect disease progression all-cause mortality . Specific Aim 1 : Conduct group randomize control trial point-of-care computer decision support plus full TRANSLATE model practice change , versus computer decision support alone promote evidence-based care primary care practice patient eGFR &lt; 60 &gt; 15 ml/min/1.73m2 confirm repeat test three month . ( CKD stag 3 4 ) Hypothesis 1.1 : CDS practice use TRANSLATE model provide great degree evidence-based guideline-concordant care CKD CDS practice . Specific Aim 2 : Conduct intent-to-treat process analysis CDS practice facilitation versus CDS practice clinical outcome CKD progression all-cause mortality . Hypothesis 2.1 : Patients stage 3 4 CKD facilitate practice slow CKD progression patient CDS practice . Hypothesis 2.2 : Patients stage 3 4 CKD facilitate practice significantly low all-cause mortality stage 3 4 patient CDS practice . Hypothesis 2.3 : The process evaluation determine qualitative method fidelity facilitate TRANSLATE program ; find challenge enablers implementation process , role facilitation , contextual factor contribute TRANSLATE decision strategy ; translate lesson learn pragmatic `` best practice '' future facilitation dissemination . Specific Aim 3 : Conduct cost-effectiveness analysis compare benefit intervention computer decision support alone intervention computer decision support plus TRANSLATE ( practice facilitation ) . Hypothesis 3.1 The intervention computer decision support plus TRANSLATE cost-effectiveness intervention computer decision support alone .</detailed_description>
