	<brief_summary>An urgent need exist find effective treatment Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) arrest reverse disease early stage . The emotional financial burden AD patient , family member , society enormous , predict grow exponentially median population age increase . Current FDA-approved therapy modestly effective best . This study examine novel therapeutic approach use intranasal insulin ( INI ) show promise short-term clinical trial . If successful , information gain study potential move INI forward rapidly therapy AD . The study also provide evidence mechanism INI may produce benefit examine key cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers hippocampal/entorhinal atrophy . These result considerable clinical scientific significance , provide therapeutically-relevant knowledge insulin 's effect AD pathophysiology . Growing evidence show insulin carry multiple function brain , insulin dysregulation may contribute AD pathogenesis . This study examine effect intranasally-administered insulin cognition , entorhinal cortex hippocampal atrophy , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) mild AD . It hypothesize 12 month treatment INI compare placebo , subject improve performance global measure cognition , memory composite daily function . In addition examination CSF biomarkers hippocampal entorhinal atrophy , study aim examine whether baseline AD biomarker profile , gender , Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 ( APOE-Îµ4 ) allele carriage predict treatment response . In study , 240 people aMCI AD give either INI placebo 12 month , follow open-label period 6 month participant give active drug . The study use insulin therapeutic agent intranasal administration focus nose brain transport mode delivery .</brief_summary>
