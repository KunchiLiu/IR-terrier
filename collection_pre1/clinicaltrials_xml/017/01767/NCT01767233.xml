	<brief_summary>Since majority patient necrotizing pancreatitis experience leak pancreatic duct course disease result intra- peripancreatic fluid collection , reasonable hypothesize placement ductal stent may prevent late complication morbidity associate pancreatic necrosis . This prospective , randomize , control multicenter trial investigates role early prophylactic ductal stenting acute necrotizing pancreatitis . The purpose study determinate safety feasibility early prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting necrotizing pancreatitis reduce complication , length stay hospital in-tensive care unit compare traditional treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>In patient suspected necrotizing pancreatitis pancreatic protocol 3phase contrast enhance ( CE ) CT shall perform . Since early CT may underestimate extent pancreatic necrosis , recommend wait least 72 hour onset symptom CT do . The CECT may repeat initial CT show necroses clinical course continue indicate severe case . MRI may use instead CT case contraindication intravenous contrast due renal failure . If CECT reveal pancreatic necrosis affect head , neck , body pancreas necrosis suspect include main pancreatic duct inform consent participate study obtain , patient randomize either ) control group traditional treatment ( i.e . discretion participate center ) b ) intervention group treatment control group plus ERP PDstenting . Patients isolated necrosis tail include study . All consecutive patient ( age 1875 year ) admit participate center acute pancreatitis area nonenhancing pancreatic parenchyma CT believe represent necrosis prospectively enrol study . At initial presentation age , gender , etiology pancreatitis , clinical laboratory finding record . Patients malignancies patient informed consent participate study obtain exclude .</criteria>
