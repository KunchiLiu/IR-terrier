	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well irinotecan hydrochloride temozolomide temsirolimus dinutuximab work treat young patient neuroblastoma return respond treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , dinutuximab , may find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether give irinotecan hydrochloride temozolomide together temsirolimus dinutuximab effective treat neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Hydrochloride Temozolomide With Temsirolimus Dinutuximab Treating Younger Patients With Refractory Relapsed Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify whether temsirolimus ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) optimal therapeutic agent consider test future Phase III randomize trial treatment newly diagnose high-risk neuroblastoma . II . To determine response rate patient relapse , refractory progressive neuroblastoma follow treatment irinotecan , temozolomide ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) compare know response rate patient treat irinotecan temozolomide alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response rate ( RR ) patient receive temsirolimus ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) combination irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) temozolomide . II . To compare progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) rate patient receive temsirolimus ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) combination irinotecan temozolomide . III . To compare toxicity associate temsirolimus ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) combine irinotecan temozolomide patient refractory , relapse progressive neuroblastoma . IV . To compare ability maintain intend dose intensity agent temsirolimus ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) combine irinotecan temozolomide patient refractory , relapse progressive neuroblastoma . V. To determine concordance tumor response define standard International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria ( INRC ) versus response per revise INRC . VI . To study clinical relevance naturally occur anti-glycan antibody patient receive ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) antibody . VII . To study clinical relevance natural killer ( NK ) receptor natural cytotoxicity trigger receptor 3 ( NKp30 ) isoforms patient receive ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) antibody temsirolimus . VIII . To study association host factor response irinotecan , temozolomide ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) . IX . To characterize tumor immune-microenvironment ( gene expression ; immune effector cell , activity signal molecule ; immune target expression ) follow treatment irinotecan , temozolomide ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) . X . To study association change tumor immune-microenvironment ( gene expression ; immune effector cell , activity signal molecule ; immune target expression ) response follow treatment irinotecan , temozolomide ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) . XI . To study association tumor genomic transcriptomic aberration well level circulate ganglioside ( GD2 ) response irinotecan , temozolomide ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 06/17/2016 ) : Patients receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) day 1-5 , irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1-5 , temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 8 . ARM II : Patients receive temozolomide PO day 1-5 , irinotecan hydrochloride 90 minute day 1-5 , dinutuximab IV 10-20 hour day 2-5 , sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC ) IV 2 hour day 6-12 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
