	<detailed_description>Rational : In reason ability store fatty acid secrete numerous pro-inflammatory cytokine , adipocyte appear key cell regulation energy metabolism immune response . Moreover , recently show adipocytes play role recruitment cell involve innate adaptive immunity adipose tissue . White adipose tissue-related disease numerous , spread excess ( obesity ) complete ( lipoatrophies ) partial lack ( lipodystrophies ) , 3 different disorder paradoxically able induce metabolic insulin resistance syndrome . Among involved cytokine , interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) , mostly know immune function , also participate quantitative qualitative balance fat mass . Thus , IL-7 over-expression animal model induces lipodystrophic syndrome insulin resistance whereas human , preliminary study show LMNA-linked lipodystrophies associate increase blood IL-7 level . IL-7 also participate reactivation autoimmunity patient suffer auto-immune type 1 islet transplantation . Therefore , aim study assess different cytokine , especially interleukin 7 , metabolic parameter level well fat mass distribution , different model fat distribution , include normal-weighed , obese lipodystrophic patient . A plasma serum , gene tissue bank constitute order improve knowledge disorder link fat mass , insulin resistance immunity , especially lipodystrophies , rare monogenic model insulin resistance . Patients : The included patient correspond subject either normal body weight , obese , suffer lipodystrophic syndrome , whatever type 2 diabetes status . Methods : Blood IL-7 level , immune and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine , lymphocytes immuno-phenotype well metabolic parameter characterize . Fat mass assess non-invasive method ( DEXA RMN ) . A plasma , serum gene bank constitute . As well adipose tissue bank patient surgery ( especially plastic surgery lipodystrophic patient ) , order cryo-preserve define inflammatory status tissue thanks histological molecular analysis . Main judgment criterion : The main judgment criterion IL-7 blood level different group accord fat mass metabolic parameter . The hypothesis human quantitative /or qualitative disturbance adipose tissue associate increase IL-7 level development insulin-resistance . Awaited result possible implication : study allow good delineate immune inflammatory component associate alteration fat mass distribution glucose metabolism . Our approach combine clinical investigation ex vivo laboratory analysis original allow good understand cellular mechanism responsible inflammatory process originate white adipose tissue accompany disorder tissue- especially lipodystrophic syndrome - open new therapeutic perspective common human disease ( obesity , diabetes ) one hand , rare disease ( lipodystrophy ) hand .</detailed_description>
