	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 give together pemetrexed disodium treat patient previously treat stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 together pemetrexed disodium may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Hsp90 Inhibitor AUY922 Treating Patients With Previously Treated Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability escalate dos AUY922 ( Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 ) give pemetrexed ( pemetrexed disodium ) 500 mg/m^2 participant previously-treated stage IV non-squamous , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective tumor response rate define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion participant previously treat non-squamous NSCLC treat pemetrexed AUY922 . II . Evaluate pharmacokinetic profile pemetrexed AUY922 . III . Evaluate toxicity , include visual toxicity , participant treat AUY922 pemetrexed . IV . Analyze tumor-tissue biomarkers potential correlation response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 . Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute weekly pemetrexed disodium IV 15 minute every 3 week . Courses repeat every 21 day 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
