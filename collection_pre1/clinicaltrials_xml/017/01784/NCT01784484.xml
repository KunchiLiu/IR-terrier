	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Fibrosis assessment Transient Elastography Fibro scan validate chronic hepatitis C , however limited data available chronic hepatitis B non alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . AIMS : Document prevalence severity fibrosis patient different chronic liver disease ( elevate liver enzymes ) follow liver unit find associated factor significant fibrosis cirrhosis ziv medical center , Safed , Bar Ilan University . Israel . METHODS : Fibro scan perform patient abnormal liver enzymnes attend liver clinic . Liver stiffness measurement , age , gender , BMI , measure . Questionaire soft drink consumption , Coffee drinking , use herb , history cancer heart disease distribute . Expected RESULTS : expect liver stiffness ( normal 1-6 Kpa ) high NAFLD patient viral hepatitis patient age , BMI , duration disease . More , expect serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) value emerge important independent predictive variable fibrosis serum ALT . A significant correlation soft drink coffee consumption extent liver fibrosis also expect . CONCLUSIONS : This prospective study confirm screen patient elevate liver enzymes beneficial detect earlier presence liver fibrosis mainly patient NAFLD .</brief_summary>
