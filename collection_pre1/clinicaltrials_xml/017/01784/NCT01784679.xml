	<brief_summary>HIBM severe progressive myopathy typically present early adulthood weakness distal muscle low extremity progress proximally , leading loss muscle strength function , ultimately wheelchair-bound state . The rate progression gradual variable course 10-20 year longer . There need good understand disease-specific feature HIBM heighten disease awareness ; facilitate early diagnosis ; identify patient ; expand knowledge clinical presentation , progression variation disease ; identify validate biomarkers efficacy measure ; inform design interpretation clinical study investigational product ; eventually optimize patient management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GNE-Myopathy Disease Monitoring Program ( GNEM-DMP ) : A Registry Prospective Observational Natural History Study Assess GNE Myopathy Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy ( HIBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective program well understand HIBM . The specific HIBM Disease Registry 's objective : - Understand geographic distribution regional incidence/prevalence GNEM . - Obtain assessment medical history , clinical presentation progression disease GNEM patient provide connection subject broader GNEM community associate program . - Provide customized information subject physicians desire information disease status progression . The specific HIBM Natural History Study 's objective : - Characterize HIBM disease presentation progression time use relevant clinical assessment muscle strength function . - Obtain information well characterize quality life understand time significant life change event HIBM patient use patient-reported outcome . - Identify biomarkers efficacy measure use endpoint future clinical study .</detailed_description>
