	<brief_summary>This study short-term effect ivacaftor sweat chloride concentration lung function cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient fall outside current FDA approval . This new , first kind drug approve use CF patient G551D mutation safely confer considerable benefit . However , highly likely CF patient many mutation benefit similarly drug , identify phenotype genotype . We enroll 30 CF subject clinical presentation one sign residual CF channel function . The sign residual function include : normal digestion , concentration chloride sweat 55 85 , milder expect CF disease CF patient severe gene mutation . The primary outcome measure difference sweat chloride concentration measure subject placebo ivacaftor . Secondary outcome measure lung function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Term Effects Ivacaftor Non-G551D Cystic Fibrosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivacaftor cystic fibrosis ( CF ) channel potentiator associate decreased sweat chloride concentration , improve lung function , improve weight gain . It currently FDA approve use CF patient G551D gate mutation . In vivo data suggest ivacaftor may potentiate CF channel cod many mutation associate residual channel function , i.e. , CF protein present cell membrane affect cell . This include 9 know gating mutation , ivacaftor also may effective CF patient non-gating mutation , include associate severe phenotype . Based result previous study , hypothesize non-G551D patient sign residual CF channel activity might respond favorably treatment ivacaftor . This include patient non-G551D gating mutation , pancreatic sufficient , sweat chloride concentration 55 85 mmol , much healthy expect . Hence , select CF patient treat ivacaftor compare placebo decrease sweat chloride concentration great 20 mmol , improvement FEV1 , weight gain . To test hypothesis , conduct prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover clinical study compare treatment ivacaftor placebo therapy ( see detail ) . Our specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To demonstrate decrease sweat chloride concentration great 20 mmol baseline 14 day ivacaftor compare placebo . Specific Aim 2 : To demonstrate improvement lung function measure baseline 14 day Ivacaftor compare placebo . Specific Aim 3 : To demonstrate weight gain baseline 14 day Ivacaftor compare placebo . Study Design : This prospective randomize double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study short-term effect ivacaftor ( aka VX-770 Kalydeco ) sweat chloride concentration lung function cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient fall outside current FDA approval . We enroll 30 CF subject UCSF CF Center variety genotype phenotypes one sign residual CFTR function . The sign residual CF channel function include : pancreatic sufficiency , sweat chloride concentration le 85 mmol , milder expect CF disease CF patient severe genotype . We exclude patient homozygous F508del mutation sweat chloride concentration great 85 mmol , true majority F508del homozygotes . This population study find unresponsive ivacaftor include nearly half CF patient . However , even among F508del homozygotes 15 percent residual chloride secretion manifest low expect sweat chloride concentration . The primary outcome measure difference sweat chloride concentration measure subject placebo ivacaftor . Secondary outcome measure include variable obtain spirometry multi-breath washout test . Research Plan : We conduct randomize double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover trial , subject treat 2 week ivacaftor 2 week placebo 2-week wash period . Up 30 subject one sign residual CFTR function randomize study . This include subject pancreatic sufficient , sweat chloride 55 85 mmol , mild CF disease set severe CF genotype . Each subject act his/her control prospective randomize double-blinded crossover trial consist 14 day ivacaftor placebo , follow 14 day washout period , follow 14 day placebo ivacaftor . The primary outcome measure sweat chloride concentration baseline , 14 day , 28 day 42 day . Secondary outcome include standard lung function measure : force vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , FEV1/FVC mid-expiratory flow ( FEF25-75 ) , multibreath washout test . Blood sample examine baseline , 14 day , 28 day 42 day evidence drug toxicity ( CBC differential , liver function test ( AST , ALT ) , non-fasting glucose , creatinine BUN ) . For female subject child bear age , urine pregnancy test do assure pregnant . If female becomes pregnant study , trial stop continue measure sweat chloride , lung function , blood work specify time . The effect ivacaftor fetus know time . Results laboratory test forward nurse practitioner directly involve study subject , serve subject safety monitor . The nurse practitioner notify study investigator laboratory value consistent adverse effect study drug power discontinue subject case serious adverse event . The common serious adverse event previous ivacaftor trial mild elevation liver test . For trial serious adverse event sufficient warrant discontinue subject include liver function test ( ALT AST ) thrice upper limit normal , abnormal renal function abnormal red white cell count .</detailed_description>
