	<brief_title>Study Respiratory Depression When Using Hydromorphone Pain Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study efficiency safety 1mg+1mg hydromorphone pain management protocol treatment long bone fracture Emergency Department . Appropriate patient 60 year old present condition cause moderate severe pain , accord attend physician 's judgment , physician would order use parenteral analgesia screen randomized one two study arm , `` 1+1 '' versus usual care group . Neither research associate , nurse , attend physician blind patient randomization . Patient pain score assess baseline use VAS score . `` 1+1 '' patient receive 1mg hydromorphone `` timepoint 0 '' ( baseline ) follow another 1mg 15 minute ( along repeat VAS pain score ) patient answer `` yes '' `` Do need pain medicine ? '' At 60 minute , patient pain assess final time patient need pain medicine , additional treatment dictate physician discretion . Usual care group patient also VAS pain score assess timepoint 0 , 15 60 minute pain treat per discretion attend physician . Patients place capnometer continuous monitor respiratory status guard opioid induce respiratory depression . Respiratory status , vital sign , pain score monitor assess efficiency pain control well safety pain medicine administration term respiratory depression . We propose `` 1+1 '' hydromorphone protocol easy implement , include set timeline , standard question , set dosage potent analgesic . We hypothesize provide adequate analgesia majority patient without cause anticipate level respiratory depression .</detailed_description>
