	<brief_summary>This research intend study efficacy CQ alone P.vivax infection also study recurrence rate among patient P.vivax standard dose CQ PQ . For study , PQ withhold 28 day study efficacy CQ alone since mask effect one another found CQ give PQ . So investigators sure whether recurrence due resistance CQ CQ concentration blood therapeutic level due PQ inadequate dose . From study investigator get finding like may CQ still work P.vivax longer work P.vivax due resistance develop P.vivax parasite . So P.vivax respond CQ therapy , investigator go second line treatment ACT similar fashion give P. falciparum infection Bhutan . And investigator find CQ still work P.vivax infection , next level study compare high dose PQ standard dose PQ ( practice ) lieu bring relapse rate P. vivax infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parasitic Clearance Recurrence Rates Among Patients With Vivax Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent time Bhutan P.vivax infection rise compare type malaria like P.falciparum use common infection . May mainly due intensive measure take place control disease especially vector control measure . So way P.falciparum go . But hand P.vivax peak infection . The main reason could due resistant Chloroquine may Chloroquine dose inadequate , could also mean could due relapse hypnozoites stage Primaquine dose could inadequate . Therefore study develop study efficacy Chloroquine alone withhold Primaquine day 28 slightly deviate current treatment protocol Bhutan . That parasitic clearance recurrence rate record Chloroquine Primaquine separately . For patient whose blood stage parasites doesnt get clear standard dose Chloroquine recurrence occur day 28 , treat second line treatment ACT , blood level Chloroquine ( drug concentration ) determine say whether could due resistance due low level Chloroquine blood . And recurrence occur day 28 Primaquine completion Primaquine dosage total 14 day ( day 29 day 42 ) patient treat similar fashion initial treatment Chloroquine Primaquine recurrence rate record develop next level study two different dos Primaquine ( high dose v low dose ) compare study efficacy Primaquine .</detailed_description>
