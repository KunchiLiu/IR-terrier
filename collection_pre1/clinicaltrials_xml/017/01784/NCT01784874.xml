	<brief_summary>The aim study generate data immunogenicity safety Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine - Serum Free ( VRVg ) comparison Imovax® Rabies order support registration VRVg USA . Primary Objectives : - To demonstrate VRVg non inferior Imovax® Rabies term proportion subject achieve rabies virus neutralize antibody ( RVNA ) titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL Day 42 . - To demonstrate observed proportion subject achieve RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL Day 42 least 99 % , 95 % low confidence limit least 97 % . Secondary Objectives : - To assess clinical safety VRVg vaccine vaccine injection administer pre-exposure schedule . - To describe immune response induce vaccine 21 day two vaccination ( Day 28 ) randomize subset subject 14 day last vaccination primary vaccination series . - To describe antibody persistence 6 12 month first vaccination subject , 18 24 month subset subject .</brief_summary>
