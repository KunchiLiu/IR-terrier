	<brief_summary>The main purpose study investigate voice production , speech intelligibility routine physiologic parameter associate Blom low profile voice inner cannula Passy-Muir one-way tracheotomy tube speak valve . Additionally , purpose study investigate effect ( ) associate Blom low profile voice inner cannula Passy-Muir one-way tracheotomy tube speak valve swallow behavior biomechanical movement hyolaryngeal complex routine diagnostic modify barium swallow evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Blom Low Profile Voice Inner Cannula Passy-Muir One-Way Tracheotomy Tube Speaking Valve Voice Production , Speech Intelligibility , Biomechanical Swallowing Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal one-way tracheotomy tube speak valve allow cognitively intact individual require tracheotomy tube communicate voice . All non-verbal communication strategy shortcoming . Lip read unreliable , communication board simplistic , write laborious , computerized augmentative communication system costly . This inability communicate effectively prevent optimal patient participation plan-of-care . Verbal communication , therefore , play integral role psychological functioning , social interaction , overall medical care . The primary criterion determine success failure one-way tracheotomy tube speak valve well allow adequate voice intensity great ambient room noise achieve audible voice production intelligible speech . The first purpose study investigate voice production speech intelligibility ability associate Blom low profile voice inner cannula Passy-Muir one-way tracheotomy tube speak valve . It hypothesize significant difference two speak valve regard physiologic parameter , voice production , speech intelligibility capability . There conflict report literature regard relationship tracheotomy tube swallow success . Some author report improvement swallow success tracheotomy tube occlude others report change aspiration status base occlusion status tracheotomy tube . Recently , report causal relationship tracheotomy tube aspiration status . There paucity research , date , report movement hyolaryngeal complex base upon occlusion status tracheotomy tube presence tracheotomy tube . The second purpose study investigate Blom low profile voice inner cannula Passy-Muir one-way tracheotomy tube speak valve impact swallow behavior movement hyolaryngeal complex routine diagnostic modify barium swallow evaluation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Over 18 year age , English speaking , ability tolerate tracheotomy tube fully deflate tracheotomy tube cuff . Inability tolerate full tracheotomy tube cuff deflation copious secretion prevent placement oneway tracheotomy tube speak valve .</criteria>
