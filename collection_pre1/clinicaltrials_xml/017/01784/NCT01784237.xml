	<brief_summary>A sniff test nasal patency common method ultrathin transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy ( UT-EGD ) select right leave nostril insertion , yet objective method select appropriate meatus insertion site ( MIS ) tolerance epistaxis rate improve . The investigator hypothesize objective anterior rhinoscopy ( specific , investigators term `` anterior meatoscopy '' ) method might effective subjective breathing-in method ( sniff test ) select appropriate meatus insertion site , thus reduce nasal bleed nasal discomfort . The aim study evaluate effectiveness endoscopic meatus score scale ( EMSS ) anterior meatoscopy ( AM ) select MIS patient tolerance adverse event nasal anesthesia UT-EGD . The investigator perform prospective randomized-controlled trial compare patient tolerability adverse event nasal anesthesia endoscopy AM-selected self-selected MIS . A total 233 consecutive patient epigastric discomfort ( symptoms non-ulcer dyspepsia ) include study large tertiary referral hospital Taiwan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Anterior Rhinoscopic Scoring Scale Predict Nasal Insertability Before Transnasal Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy ( UT-EGD ) offer physicians patient number advantage compare conventional peroral EGD ( P-EGD ) become increasingly popular clinical practice past several year . However , insertion failure vary 2.3 % 62.7 % due tight nasal vault report . Dumortire report 17.9 % patient refuse UT-EGD due nasal pain epistaxis remain common side effect . Therefore well perform nasal anesthesia regard important step UT-EGD . The concept endoscopic guidance actually application anterior rhinoscopy select patent meatus nasal anesthesia endoscopic insertion . The scope place side nasal cavity patent . Therefore , reasonable nasal examination perform prior UT-EGD determine less obstructed side . In fact , anterior rhinoscopy common outpatient procedure otolaryngologist perform otoscope . Instead , use transnasal endoscope select patent meatus thus first introduce concept anterior `` meatus-copy '' , different `` meatoscopy '' urinary meatus . The conventional sniff nasal patency test inspection nasal passability ask patient compare breathing-in air flow either side nose . This self-selected subjective method choose right leave nostril transnasal endoscopy . Nasal septum nasal turbinate , especially inferior turbinate , erectile tissue nose , fluctuate greatly size depend physiological change ( e.g . body temperature exercise ) response inflammation . Often , sensation block nose subjective . The otolaryngologist may find perfectly patent airway yet patient insist nose clog . Therefore , objective method evaluate nasal patency would help avoid narrowed meatus , thereby reduce nasal pain epistaxis nasal anesthesia transnasal endoscopy . Methods use objectively measure nasal patency resistance include rhinomanometry acoustic rhinometry . However , two method sophisticated straightforward . There literature describe optimal selection method transnasal endoscopic insertion . Assessments nasal patency dynamic method include nasal peak flow , rhinomanometry , acoustic rhinometry . However , convenient endoscopic method evaluate nasal meatus patency propose . Locating anterior portion meatus , transnasal endoscope act nasoscope look patent meatus . We find anterior meatuscopy allows direct visualisation turbinates meatus without cause discomfort . Thus may useful ancillary technique select patent meatus scope insertion . Hence , primary objective study evaluate whether anterior meatuscopy score system could reduce nasal bleed improve tolerance associate UT-EGD .</detailed_description>
