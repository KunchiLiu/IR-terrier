	<detailed_description>HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis highly variable penetrance : 1 % homozygous woman 30 % homozygous men would develop clinically express disease . No predictive phenotypic genetic marker available . The Iron Reabsorption Index ( IRI ) , recently describe group , correspond daily amount reabsorb iron subject whose iron stock le 50 µg / L stabilize maintenance phlebotomy . For one patient , IRI constant time , probably related functional deficit underlie . Unfortunately , IRI retrospective marker require least one year treatment , limit practical interest directs use research activity . We 're look simple phenotypic marker readily available clinical practice , would predict time diagnosis evolution disease therefore would better define therapeutic option . The pathophysiology hemochromatosis dysregulation hepcidin synthesis . We assume hepcidin / ferritin ratio could phenotypic marker like IRI , stage disease independent constant time . Indeed H/F ratio may reflect adaptability hepcidin production regulation level iron stock No data available validated value ratio . The aim project determine intra-individual variation H / F ratio time maintenance therapy ass correlation IRI . The study involve 30 C282Y homozygous men , follow reference center phlebotomy maintenance therapy stabilize low level ferritin ( &lt; 50 µg / L ) least 1 year . The intra-individual variation H/F ration determine 5 sample every 14 day 8 week . The correlation IRI validate externally iron load observe diagnosis . We take account know variation factor like liver damage associate hemochromatosis diagnosis .</detailed_description>
