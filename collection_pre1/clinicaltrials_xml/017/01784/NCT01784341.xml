	<brief_title>Circadian Phase Bipolar Depression : Is Delayed Does Normalize With Remission ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder prevalent , disabling , chronic mood disorder characterize depressive symptom alternate hypomanic , manic mixed state . The depressive phase illness predominates associate cognitive , occupational social impairment , psychiatric comorbidity , increase mortality suicide general medical problem . Clarification pathophysiology illness important improve treatment effectiveness . Various line evidence suggest circadian factor play role onset maintenance bipolar depression . Rhythmic clinical disturbance find alter sleep-wake cycle , diurnal mood shift , rest-activity change , seasonal feature , cyclic pattern relapse remission polarity inversion define disorder . Chronotherapeutic treatment act modify circadian phase show effective ameliorate depressive symptom illness . In addition circumstantial evidence , direct data implicate circadian dysfunction bipolar depression . Genetic study document association various circadian gene bipolar illness . Actigraphic study activity level demonstrate illness-remission difference phase advance manic state . Though latter study employ direct assessment methodology , article attempt investigate circadian process bipolar depression use core clock process . These basic clock rhythm include core body temperature , cortisol level dim light melatonin onset . Because physiological oscillation less influenced behavior le prone masking , accurately reflect intrinsic time central pacemaker . This study use dim light melatonin onset actigraphy ass status change circadian phase state bipolar depression remission . Using case control methodology , adult subject evaluate , remission depressive phase bipolar disorder . General Aim The overall aim project compare time dim-light melatonin onset actigraphy-based activity pattern adult patient bipolar disorder depress vs remit state . These marker enable characterization change circadian phase illness recovery . A case control design enable use small sample size capable identify statistically significant change time circadian rhythm two state interest . Hypotheses It predict dim light melatonin onset activity profile delay depress vs. euthymic state bipolar disorder . It anticipate phase delay lessen bipolar subject achieve remission depression . Last , predict circadian phase dim light melatonin onset activity profile correlate , delay depressive phase , less delayed euthymia .</detailed_description>
