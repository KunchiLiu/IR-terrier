Able understand willing sign write informed consent document . Phase II Inclusion Criteria Histologic documentation well differentiate moderately differentiate locally unresectable metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor either primary metastatic site document disease progression ≤ 12 month prior enrollment whose disease currently amenable surgery , radiation , modality therapy curative intent . If different histologic classification scheme use , equivalent histologic classification ( example `` grade 1 , '' `` low grade , '' `` intermediate grade '' ) allow . There must histologic documentation pancreatic primary site clinical evidence pancreatic neuroendocrine primary tumor determine treat physician . Documentation metastatic site sufficient clinical evidence pancreatic primary site . In case discordant pathology , patient eligibility determine PI review available record . Patients neuroendocrine tumor ( e.g. , gastrinoma , VIPoma ) pancreatic peripancreatic primary site strongly suspect also eligible . Evidence measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 2 cm conventional technique ≥ 1 cm spiral CT scan . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimen allow . Any prior treatment ( exception lanreotide octreotide ) must complete least 4 week prior initiation treatment . Prior treatment embolization ablative therapy allow measurable disease remain outside treated area definite progression treat lesion . There limit number prior procedure .
