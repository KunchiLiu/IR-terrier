	<brief_summary>- The investigator hypothesize NSCL patient receive therapy base baseline tumor marker level would attain high response rate patient control arm receiving non customize therapy . - patient stage IIIA ( N2 ) NSCLC randomize 2:1 ratio customize therapy base biomarkers status ( ERCC1 , RRM1 , TS EGFR mutation ) v standard chemotherapy . - The primary objective multicenter trial compare pathological complete response subject randomize , treatment arm . - Secondary objective compare randomized subject treatment arm : response rate , disease-free survival , overall survival , one , two three year survival safety profile . The study expect demonstrate feasibility approach logistic problem associate biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Customized Neoadjuvant Versus Standard Chemotherapy NSCL Patients With Resectable Stage IIIA ( N2 ) Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Subjects stratify histology biological marker ( ERCC1 , RRM1 , TS , EGFR mutation ) . Randomization centralize coordinate centre site . Patients receive chemotherapy cisplatin + docetaxel customize therapy 3 cycle ( 60 day gefitinib ) surgery . Every 4 month 3 year every 6 month 2 year follow surgery , subject assess investigator adverse event relate study drug , documentation post study therapy receive , DFS , survival . - Periodic evaluation trial data conduct independent data monitoring committee ensure subject safety validity scientific merit study . Assuming study stop plan futility analyse safety reason , final analysis take place target number event ( pathological complete response ) reach , estimate take place 24 month post study initiation . - The pathological complete response ( pCR ) two group compute ITT population compare mean chi-square test without continuity correction . For exploratory purpose , multivariate logistic regression model fit data , pCR response variable treatment ( standard/ experimental ) histo/molecular subgroup covariate . The heterogeneity relative efficacy tailor approach various subgroup ( =subgroup analysis ) evaluate include model appropriate set treatment-by-subgroup interaction term , use standard likelihood ratio test . Time-to-event analysis ( DFS OS ) use standard Kaplan-Meier estimator ( Log-rank test ) semi-parametric PH regression model . Safety summarize base adverse event , vital sign laboratory assessment . A group sequential design use compare Overall Survival two study arm .</detailed_description>
