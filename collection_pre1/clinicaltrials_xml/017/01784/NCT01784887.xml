	<brief_title>Clinical Mechanistic Demonstration Bioelectric Dressing System Non-healing Wound Management : A Phase II Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PROCELLERA Antimicrobial Wound Dressing consider non-interactive wound dress contain silver zinc , classification product code MGP . Non-interactive wound dressing consider FDA non-significant risk , per Investigational Device Exemptions Manual ( publication FDA 96-4159 ) . Procellera FDA clear K081977 professional use wound dress partial full-thickness wound . Selection Subjects Type Subject Population - At least 18 year old - Male female - All ethnic group As military-civilian cooperative Phase II prospective randomize trial , study population include chronic wound patient military civilian background . As incidence complex non-healing wound remain high military civilian hospital setting , estimate recruitment rate sufficiently rapid research site . While unanticipated delay ( e.g . slow accrual ) may occur , limited patient population length time allot clinical study ( 2 year ) assume offset delay . A total 60 participant enrol studywide obtain 50 evaluable participant site combine . Up 16 patient screened day . A consecutive series patient meet follow inclusion/exclusion criterion agree participate recruit . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria 1 . Inclusion Criteria - 18 year age old , male female - Female subject pregnant - pregnancy exclude HCG ( urine serum ) history ( tubal ligation , hysterectomy , menopause ) . - Have non-healing external wound location body ≥90 day duration ( 10-50 cm2 ) initial screen exceed 3 cm depth . - May wound require Negative Pressure Wound Therapy conjunction standard care wound treatment . - Subject able apply study dress his/her wound , reliable capable caregiver . - Subjects adequate blood flow wound define Skin Perfusion Pressure ( SPP ) 47-49 &gt; 30mmHg record intact epidermis near open wound margin . - Subjects arterial repair adequate blood flow wound define Skin Perfusion Pressure ( SPP ) &gt; 30mmHg record intact epidermis near open wound margin . - Absence clinical sign infection ( fever ; malodorous wound exudate ; increase wound pain , drainage , erythema , friable granulation tissue edema ) . - Participant agree participate follow-up evaluation . - Participant must able read understand inform consent , sign inform consent . 2 . Exclusion Criteria - Less 18 year age . - Pregnant lactate woman . - Have undergone treatment systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy past 2 month . - Currently undergo dialysis renal failure . - Subject wound result electrical burn , arterial insufficiency , chemical radiation insult . - Subject wound expose bone , ligament , nerve , artery and/or tendon . - Active previous ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) chemotherapy . - Active previous ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) radiation affect wound area treat study device standard care . - Physical mental disability geographical concern ( residence within reasonable travel distance ) would hamper compliance require study visit . - The Investigator believe subject unwilling unable comply study protocol requirement , include application bioelectric dressing , standard-of-care self-care requirement , study-related follow visit requirement . - History infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus immunodeficiency disorder . - Heterotopic ossification underlie wound base upon previous image historical information subject 's chart . - Severe anemia - Hgb &lt; 7 g/dl ( male ) &lt; 6.5 ( female ) coagulopathy ( INR &gt; 1.7 ) . - Severe malnutrition ( Albumin &lt; 3.0 gm/dl ; &gt; 10 % weight loss precede 6 week ) . - Allergy silver zinc .</detailed_description>

Absence clinical sign infection ( fever ; malodorous wound exudate ; increase wound pain , drainage , erythema , friable granulation tissue edema ) . Participant agree participate followup evaluation . Participant must able read understand inform consent , sign inform consent . Less 18 year age . Pregnant lactate woman . Have undergone treatment systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy past 2 month . Currently undergoing dialysis renal failure . Subject wound result electrical burn , arterial insufficiency , chemical radiation insult . Subject wound expose bone , ligament , nerve , artery and/or tendon . Active previous ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) chemotherapy . Active previous ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) radiation affect wound area treat study device standard care . Physical mental disability geographical concern ( residence within reasonable travel distance ) would hamper compliance require study visit . The Investigator believe subject unwilling unable comply study protocol requirement , include application bioelectric dressing , standardofcare selfcare requirement , studyrelated follow visit requirement . History infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus immunodeficiency disorder . Heterotopic ossification underlie wound base upon previous image historical information subject 's chart .
