	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate impact home-based couple HIV-testing counsel male partner education partner HIV test critical maternal infant health outcome pregnancy postpartum period . Additionally , study seek assess cost-effectiveness approach . Involvement men antenatal postpartum period , include HIV test male partner , substantial benefit woman infant . In observational study , male participation antenatal care associate increase uptake prevention mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) intervention , recently , study Kenya find significant HIV-free survival benefit child HIV-infected woman whose male partner attend antenatal care couple HIV testing offer . In study 31 % ~450 men invite counsel test come clinic , highlight challenge face across sub-Saharan Africa try access male partner pregnant woman . In area high HIV-1 prevalence , high level male involvement may readily achievable home-based counsel test highly acceptable benefit male participation HIV test extend HIV-uninfected pregnant postpartum woman infant . Reaching men pregnancy may reduce incident HIV infection vertical transmission among woman , effort engage men antenatal care Western Kenya thus far achieve limited success . This intervention may achieve gain beyond prevention maternal infant HIV-1 acquisition identification HIV-infected men would otherwise learn status delay treatment , improve child health target education male partner . When administered home-based setting simple , establish intervention promotion exclusive breastfeed show associated significant reduction child mortality . Home-based approach also lend integration target intervention promotion HIV testing among male partner at-risk pregnant woman . Furthermore , successful HIV test program male partner pregnant woman potential reach large number men may unaware HIV status HIV-infected care , provide linkage treatment clinic promote prevention intervention , safe sex voluntary male circumcision uninfected . In randomized clinical trial 600 couple ( 300 treatment arm ) randomize standard antenatal care home-based partner education HIV testing ( HOPE ) part routine pregnancy service . Women enrol antenatal clinic Kisumu District Hospital , Kisumu , Kenya . Couples control group receive HOPE Intervention , feature home-based couple counsel HIV test well key educational message concern HIV prevention behavior , facility delivery , exclusive breastfeeding , post-partum family planning . Women control arm invite bring male partner antenatal clinic voluntary clinic test counsel . Women follow clinic visit 6-weeks 14-weeks postpartum male partner 6-months post-partum . These follow-up visit include questionnaire measure uptake HIV testing , facility delivery , exclusive breastfeeding postpartum contraceptive use well linkage HIV care . Cost-effectiveness intervention also evaluate order inform future scale-up . First , investigator hypothesize successful implementation HOPE result high uptake male partner HIV testing , couple test disclosure HIV status . The investigator also hypothesize benefit HIV-infected HIV-uninfected woman child improve uptake intervention improve maternal child health . Specifically , investigator anticipate high level facility delivery , optimal breastfeeding practice , post-partum contraceptive use , well increased uptake antiretroviral treatment HIV+ woman intervention arm , relative control arm . Second , investigator hypothesize great 85 % HIV-1-infected men identify home-based partner education test ( HOPE ) access care treatment service , , overall , woman HOPE arm know partner ' status time point partner care treatment .

At end enrollment visit , woman randomize HOPE treatment INVITE arm base computer-generated block randomization . 7 . Consent Procedure : During screen , woman ask verbal consent screen process , present consent form ask write consent enrollment visit . Men offer consent form home visit HOPE intervention . Participants opt study time . 8 . Data Collection Procedure : A . Basic detail : Women study arm clinic enrollment visit , two clinic visit postpartum 6 14 week correspond childhood immunization visit , home visit 6 month postpartum . Participants reimburse 300 Kenyan shilling per clinic visit 200 Kenyan shilling per home visit .

Women intervention arm additional home visit home-based counseling test occur within 1-2 week enrollment . Each visit describe detail outline study design flowchart . B. Enrollment visit : In addition provision inform consent randomization , woman arm interview examine . Peripheral blood specimen collect HIV-1 rapid testing , question ask demographic socio-behavioral characteristic , medical , sexual , reproductive history , recent current symptom . All woman ask allow counselor study team accompany home confirm locator information future trace retention effort . C. Home visit : All woman propose study home visit confirm physical location home write address often unreliable . For mother-to-child HIV transmission study HIV-discordant couple study Kenya , conduct home visit day enrollment shortly thereafter highly acceptable critical component effective trace retention plan . Among HIV-discordant couple Dr. Farquhar 's recent prospective cohort study , uptake home visit 97 % pregnant HIV-infected woman Nairobi , proportion agree home visit also exceed 95 % . For study , write description physical location record counselor visit woman , incorporate woman 's study file addition GPS coordinate , record use handheld device use successfully Nairobi region Kenya research group .

Diagnosis treatment incident HIV-1 infection among woman : For woman initially HIV-seronegative , result 6-month rapid HIV test provide soon available , woman incident infection refer initiation antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) . Study clinic referral clinic educate importance rapid initiation ART woman newly infect promote immediate treatment . As result education give exist standard care practice , site prepare provide ART study clinic ensure ART initiate . When available , exist on-site PMTCT program utilized leverage PEPFAR government resource procure drug HIV-infected woman site . However , since national supply may inconsistent , study team prepared supplement stock . 11 . Diagnosis , treatment , follow-up HIV-1 infection male partner : In region surround Kisumu HIV-1 seroprevalence among woman estimate 10-15 % . Assuming fairly substantial level male participation ( &gt; 75 % ) , investigator anticipate diagnose upwards 25 men HIV infection partner test intervention . These men refer near Comprehensive Care Clinic ( CCC ) CD4 test , HIV care , ART indicate . For Aim 3 , uptake HIV care treatment service among men test HIV-seropositive home-based testing measure use self-reports home visit 6 month postpartum . A questionnaire use ass follow outcome : 1 ) presentation CCC counseling , 2 ) initiation trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , 3 ) acceptance CD4 testing , 4 ) ART initiation among men eligible .
