	<brief_summary>Specific Aims Our study objective investigate video peer model visit , plus immersive virtual reality preventive dental visit , reduce dental fear uncooperative behavior among child ASD . SPECIFIC AIM : To pilot test feasibility effectiveness video peer model immersive virtual reality reduce dental fear among child autism undergo preventive dental visit . Methods : The investigator enroll eighty ( 80 ) subject age 7-17 year know diagnosis autism , history dental fear , per parental report . Study hypotheses : The primary hypothesis interest : ( ) The mean change Venham Anxiety Score ( VAS ) 4 month period child ASD receive video intervention ( Group B ) different mean change VAS 4-month period child ASD control group . ( ii ) The mean change VAS 4-month period child ASD receive immersive VR intervention ( Group C ) different mean change VAS 4-month period child ASD control group . ( iii ) The mean change VAS 4-month period child ASD receive video intervention plus immersive VR intervention ( Group D ) different mean change VAS 4-month period child ASD control group . The secondary hypothesis : ( ) The mean change Venham Behavior Score 4-month period child ASD Group D different mean change Venham Behavior Score 4-month period child ASD Group B C .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dental care significant unmet health care need child Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) . Many child ASD receive dental care fear associate dental procedure ; oftentimes require general anesthesia regular dental procedure , place risk associate complication . Many child ASD strong preference visual stimulus , particularly electronic screen medium ; affinity utilized educational instruction . Objective : To determine innovative strategy use two type electronic screen medium feasible beneficial reduce fear uncooperative behavior child ASD undergo dental visit . Study procedure For randomize control study , randomize participant one 4 group : ) control group ( Group A ) ; b ) video peer model group ( Group B ) ; c ) immersive VR group ( Group C ) ) video peer model plus immersive VR group ( Group D ) . All enrol child pre-visit dental clinic , receive usual care baseline value parameter obtain . Medical record study child flag identify upon arrival RA . In exam room , dental assistant measure pulse rate use pulse oximeter . The dentist RA complete Venham Anxiety Behavioral Scale dental procedure study child . All study subject schedule return follow preventive dental visit 4-6 month , usual practice CHB , depend child 's oral health status . Children assign intervention Groups B D mail copy DVD pre-recorded peer model visit 4 week schedule return preventive dental visit . The parent ask review video child orient stage dental visit . In addition , child assign Group C D give virtual reality headset watch movie image dental visit . Children assign Group A ( control group ) receive neither DVD VR headset visit . We repeat measurement return visit study child . Participant randomization : Once identify entire sample eligible subject , generate list subject enrol study . With assistance statistician , random allocation subject Group A , B , C D. Sample size calculation : In order 80 % chance detect difference 1 unit either mean change Venham anxiety score ( VAS ) 4-month period child ASD assign Group B , C D , mean change VAS 4-month period child ASD Group A , allow 20 % dropout rate , total sample size 80 child require . Subjects allocate equally 4 group group randomly assign 20 subject . Data Analyses : After obtain value Venham Anxiety Behavior Scores group baseline 4 month period , change score calculate subject mean change score standard deviation generate group . WE use two-sided t-test test hypothesis . Bonferroni adjustment use account multiple comparison carry . The association important covariates , level cognitive functioning , IQ , age , gender number hour ABA receive change VAS model use linear regression analysis , outcome variable mean change score subject . ( A separate model fit outcome variable ) . Further analysis include examine association pulse rate ( continuous outcome measure ) covariates list . All analysis conduct study statistician PI . Data Management Methods The RA collect manage study data . We enter personal information study subject obtain enrollment study database . All subject assign code use throughout study . No subject identify personal information use make study code specific patient . The link study-ID medical record number keep locked/double password protect file . The Dr Isong RA one know key/passwords . Data Safety Monitoring Plan Every 6 month , study data protocol review RA PI ensure confirm write stipulation . Any miss data note collect . To prevent disclosure , information participation result research place medical record . Study data cod key code keep separate lock file . All research data enter database . No name enter database , code assign research record . All result remain confidential . Only anonymized data share among collaborator . Safety monitoring Risks associate study expect minimal . Any report risk discomfort result study ( please see ) experience study subject document appropriate treatment referral provide . Subjects inform dis-enroll study time experience adverse effect .</detailed_description>
