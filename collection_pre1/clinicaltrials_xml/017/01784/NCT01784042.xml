	<detailed_description>Obesity pre- postmenopausal year link risk postmenopausal breast cancer . Multiple mechanisms likely contribute obesity associate breast cancer risk . They include increased insulin like growth factor ( IGF ) -I bioavailability , oxidative stress , raise leptin adiponectin ratio , increase inflammatory cytokine responsible creation systemic local hyperestrogenic milieu induction aromatase may also responsible reduction antitumor immunity stimulation immunosuppressive cell . While derivative chromosome disulfiram ( DER ) show reverse obesity relate phenotypic feature , yet establish whether DER reduces breast cancer risk use validated tissue biomarkers predictive breast cancer development . N:3FA ( 3-fatty acid ) show ameliorate obesity-induced effect circulate leptin adiponectin , insulin resistance , endogenous estrogen production inflammation . Although preclinical study indicate protective effect n:3FA mammary carcinogenesis , data human inconclusive , likely result lack control clinical trial . Investigators hypothesize combination DER n:3FA reduce breast cancer risk additive/synergistic fashion complementary effect multiple inter-related pathway account obesity associate breast cancer risk . Investigators propose conduct clinical trial study involve overweight obese woman age 30 55 high risk breast cancer find random periareolar fine needle aspiration hyperplasia without atypia Ki67 ≥2 premenopausal ≥1.5 postmenopausal . Following stratification accord menopausal status randomize one four experimental group .</detailed_description>
