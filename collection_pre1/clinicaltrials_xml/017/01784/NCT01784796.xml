	<brief_title>Mindful Hearts Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence demonstrate chronic stress double risk myocardial infarction contribute proinflammatory process implicate coronary artery disease stroke . Veterans experience combat great risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) compare noncombat Veterans non-Veterans . However , previous research focus primarily male Veterans . Yet statistics reveal startle number ( 81-92 % ) woman Veterans report least one traumatic event sometime live woman Veterans experience significant rate prior life adversity sexual assault , physical violence , combat exposure . Compelling evidence demonstrate strong relationship breadth prior life adversity , proinflammatory cytokine stress-related inflammatory disease , CVD . Assisting woman Veterans reduce stress develop cop strategy may improve psychological well-being reduce CVD risk . Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) involve intensive training mindfulness , promote positive adaptation life stress . MBSR find reduce symptom depression improve quality life Veterans experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . Practitioners MBSR gain increase awareness insight relationship among thought , emotion , somatic reactivity facilitate change condition pattern emotional reaction . However , minimal research randomize control trial ( RCTs ) examine MBSR intervention reduce CVD risk woman Veterans . Furthermore , previous study neither examine CVD risk objectively use well-established CVD risk score measure endothelial dysfunction . Endothelial dysfunction acknowledge precede atherosclerosis strong predictor CVD . Furthermore , study demonstrate lifestyle change , exercise yoga , reverse endothelial dysfunction . However , study find consider endothelial function relation MBSR . Moreover , potential protective risk factor , prior life adversity , social support , health behavior , acculturation , diurnal cortisol , posit moderate effect psychological well-being inflammation MBSR examine . Women Veterans age 18 70 year least one CVD risk factor ( define Framingham CVD Risk Scale ) randomize either 8-week MBSR program health education control program . The follow specific aim address : ( 1 ) Determine extent training MBSR ( 1 ) improve psychological well-being , ( 2 ) decrease inflammatory burden , ( 3 ) reduces cardiovascular risk woman Veterans ; ( 2 ) Evaluate protective risk factor posit moderate effect MBSR psychological well , inflammatory burden cardiovascular risk woman Veterans . Age , body mass index ( BMI ) , menstrual status , medication , socioeconomic status ( SES ) evaluate covariates . The propose research innovative MBSR evaluate woman Veterans risk CVD . The investigator expect MBSR improve psychological well-being reduce CVD risk improvement sustain least 6 month . Given CVD major cause mortality , research may broader implication reduce CVD general population .</detailed_description>
