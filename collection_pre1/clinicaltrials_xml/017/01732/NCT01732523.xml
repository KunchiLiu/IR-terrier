	<brief_title>Predictive Value Neovascularization Within Asymptomatic Carotis Stenosis CEUS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Injection ultrasound contrast agent , conjunction contrast specific image technique , increasingly accept clinical use diagnostic ultrasound imaging . As microbubbles contrast agent appear ideal pure intravascular tracer enhance vascular lumen important assess dynamic spatial temporal heterogeneity microvasculature , contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) provide unique opportunity new application especially vascular imaging . CEUS carotid artery introduce non-invasive technique improve detection carotid atherosclerosis evaluate presence plaque vascularity ( vasa vasorum ) . As proliferation intraplaque adventitial vas vasorum ( neovascularization ) inherently link atherosclerotic plaque development , plaque inflammation vulnerability , direct visualization intraplaque neovascularization CEUS emerge new marker plaque instability . Aim : The aim study test predictive value presence degree carotid artery atherosclerotic lesion neovascularization assess contrast enhance carotid ultrasound patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis regard lesion progression future cerebrovascular coronary event . Methode : - Baseline characteristic : cardiovascular risk factor ( hypertension , diabetes mellitus , smoking , lipid ) , history myocardial infarction ( MI ) , coronary peripheral vascular revascularization , previous stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , medication ( contemporaneous carotid duplex ultrasound examination ) - Atherosclerosis standard carotis duplex ultrasound : Carotid standard ultrasound perform use Philips ( Bothel , WA ) iU22 ultrasound scanner equip linear array L9-3 MHz probe . The examination perform trained vascular specialist use standard image protocol . Both leave right carotid artery examine . The examination include B-mode ultrasound imaging , color Doppler ultrasound pulse Doppler spectral analysis common carotid artery ( CCA ) , extracranial segment internal carotid artery ( ICA ) , external carotid artery . The mean maximal IMT value measure distal part CCA ( 2 cm proximal tip flow divider ) fare wall use automate edge detection program ( QLAB software , Philips ; Bothel , WA ) . The degree stenosis ICA side grade accord current guideline 30-50 % , 50-69 % , ≥ 70 % stenosis base spectral Doppler velocity . The lesion area [ cm2 ] plaque calculate draw region interest along lumen-intima interface media-adventitia interface plaque 2D longitudinal plan . Total lesion burden express total plaque area calculate add plaque area side . Total lesion volume [ cm3 ] carotid plaque measure use stack contour measurement 3D data use General Imaging 3D Quantification program ( QLAB software , Philips ) . Lesion echogenicity plaque classify accord well establish criterion uniformly echolucent ( Class I ) , predominantly echolucent ( Class II ) , predominantly echogenic ( Class III ) , uniformly echogenic extensively calcify ( Class IV ) . - Carotid contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) : For CEUS image intravenous continuous infusion ( VueJectTM , Bracco , Milan , Italy ) 4.8ml phospholipid-stabilized sulfur hexafluoride microspheres ( SonoVueTM , Bracco ) flow rate 1ml/min precede bolus inject 1ml use . The examination perform use Philips ( Bothel , WA ) iU22 ultrasound scanner equip linear array L9-3 MHz probe ultrasound contrast harmonic software ( puls inversion / power modulation ) . Following set CEUS image implement : mechanical index 0.06 , overall gain 80 % , compression 36 provide `` pre set '' . Imaging start contrast injection perform 2 minute right side follow 2 minute leave side standardized follow : use longitudinal view focus carotid stenosis carotid bulb , proximal part ICA . The standard CEUS study store digitally DICOM format analysis quantification . - Quantification intraplaque neovascularization CEUS imaging : Following infusion ultrasound contrast agent , presence blood flow `` activity '' identify base dynamic movement echogenic reflector ( microbubbles ) observe within intraplaque microvessels . Intraplaque neovascularization ( contrast-agent enhancement ) categorize visual interpretation use grade scale previously publish : Grade 1 used indicate appearance move bubble within plaque microspheres confine adjacent adventitial layer , Grade 2 consider moderate visible appearance move bubble within plaque adventitial side plaque shoulder , Grade 3 reserve image extensive intraplaque neovascularization clear visible appearance bubble move plaque core . The enhancement lesion injection contrast material also quantitatively analyze use time-signal intensity curve analysis software package display signal intensity-versus-time curve region interest process enhancement . A region interest size shape fit lesion drawn manually position lesion . Another region interest size shape position lumen carotid artery . The carotid lesion lumen signal intensity-versus-time curve produce . The degree enhancement lesion constant flow contrast material ( steady-state ) measure look enhance intensity plaque ratio enhance intensity ( dB ) lesion lumen artery . - Clinical ultrasound follow-up : A clinical follow carotid ultrasound follow include CEUS perform 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year inclusion study . - Sample size analysis : Sample size estimate demonstrate statistically significant difference cardiovascular event rate 5 year inclusion patient moderate extensive intraplaque neovascularization ( vulnerable lesions/patients ) intraplaque neovascularization ( stable lesion ) , assume 2-sided level statistical significance .05 , 80 % power , event rate 30 % group intraplaque neovascularization compare 15 % group without intraplaque neovascularization.This result requirement total 240 individual study project . Hypothesis potential clinical significance : The investigator hypothesize patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis , lesion intraplaque neovascularization pronounce lesion progression time , patient pronounce intraplaque neovascularization baseline vascular event follow-up . These result would support concept intraplaque neovascularization associate plaque instability vulnerability therefore , use CEUS could provide additional non-invasive , simple , safe , reliable image modality stratify individual risk . The identification vulnerable progressive carotid lesion increase risk rupture thrombosis identification intraplaque neovascularization expect improve prediction future vascular event thus allow well treatment selection . It help clinician risk stratify carotid stenosis . Particularly , help identify unstable 50-69 % carotid stenosis may already benefit invasive therapy carotid endarterectomy stenting , may refrain patient invasive therapy stable &gt; 70 % stenosis .</detailed_description>
