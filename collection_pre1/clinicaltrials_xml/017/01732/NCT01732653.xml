	<brief_summary>The propose randomized control trial evaluate effect treadmill train augment virtual reality fall risk . 300 old adult history fall recruit participate study . This include old adult ( n=100 ) , patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) ( n=100 ) , patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) ( n=100 ) . Subjects randomly assign intervention group ( treadmill train virtual reality ) active-control group ( treadmill train without virtual reality ) . Each person participate training program set outpatient set 3 time per week 6 week . Assessments take place , , 1 month 6 month completion training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Treadmill Training Program Augmented Virtual Reality Decrease Fall Risk Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , single blind , parallel group , randomize control trial 6 month follow-up employed investigate effect treadmill train augment virtual reality fall risk . The study include 300 old participant experience two fall previous 6 month . Participants randomize either intervention control group . The intervention group receive 18 session Treadmill Training Virtual Reality ( TT+VR ) active control comparison receive 18 training session treadmill train alone ( TT ) without VR simulation All intervention deliver therapist train standard protocol . All subject train 3 time week 6 week , session last approximately 45 minutes.Training progression base increase motor cognitive challenge , individualize participant 's level performance . Primary outcome measure : The primary outcome measure study fall rate 6 month post intervention . Secondary outcome measure include gait speed gait variability usual dual task condition negotiate physical obstacle measure . Endurance assess use 2 Minute Walk Test mobility assess use Four Square Step Test ( FSST ) , The Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test ( mini-BESTest ) . Community ambulation assess use tri-axial accelerometer ( 'Axivity ' Ltd. ) wear participant 7 day . Cognitive function assess use computerized neuropsychological test battery ( Mindstreams , 'NeuroTrax ' Corp. , NJ ) well standardized neuropsychological test ( Montreal Cognitive Assessment , The Trail Making Test ; Verbal Fluency ) . Quality life evaluate use SF-36 Health Survey</detailed_description>
