	<brief_summary>Trial Objectives : The objective investigate efficacy safety afatinib induction chemotherapy primary unresected patient locally advanced , HPV-negative , stage III IVa/b HNSCC include oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx . Primary Objective Phase I The primary objective phase I portion trial determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose daily oral afatinib safe combination carboplatin AUC 6 paclitaxel 175mg/m2 q 21 day induction regimen . Primary Objective Phase 2 The primary objective phase 2 portion trial estimate objective tumor response rate toxicity induction therapy patient treat afatinib dose determined Phase I . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective phase II estimate : 1 ) overall response entire treatment completion CRT , 2 ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 2 year , 3 ) overall survival ( OS ) 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Afatinib/Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Induction Chemotherapy In HPV-Negative HNSCC .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/phase II prospective multicenter trial investigate efficacy safety afatinib induction chemotherapy primary unresected patient HPV-negative locally advanced SCC stage III IVa/b oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx . The primary endpoint overall response rate completion induction chemotherapy . Eligible patient begin 14 day lead-in period afatinib alone . This follow immediately 2 cycle induction chemotherapy carboplatin AUC 6 IV , paclitaxel 175mg/m2 day 1 , afatinib continuous daily dosing . Each cycle repeat every 21 day . All patient receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy begin 2-3 week completion second cycle induction chemotherapy ( Refer Study Schema page 8 protocol ) . During period induction chemotherapy , complete history physical ( include weight ) tumor assessment physical examination Day 1 cycle perform document . Complete blood count differential comprehensive metabolic profile perform weekly . After completion induction chemotherapy , reassessment blood work , physical exam , CT/MRI neck nasopharyngolaryngoscopy perform . After completion CRT , patient MRI , CT , FDG PET approximately 12 week CRT . Follow-up standard care point onwards . Physical exam , blood work AE assessment also frequently perform entire treatment .</detailed_description>
