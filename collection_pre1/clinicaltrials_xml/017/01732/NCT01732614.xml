	<brief_summary>This trial seek prove sub-lethal laser power level effective less damaging traditional laser . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) affect approximately 29 % diabetic patient disease duration 20 year one frequent cause vision loss population . The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) demonstrate significant benefit laser photocoagulation treatment clinically significant macular edema , reduce incidence vision loss approximately 50 % 3 year ' follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sub-visible , non-damaging visible laser ( 532 nm ) exposures 100 m duration result enhanced expression heat shock protein retina . To test clinical efficacy sub-visible retinal therapy use ms-range exposure visible laser one need first establish proper titration method necessary assure one hand lack tissue damage , hand sufficient hyperthermia elicit cellular response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must macular edema involve center macula correspond leakage fluorescein angiography . Thickening fovea least 300 micron ( thickness central point OCT ) standard deviation center point &lt; 10 % signal strength ≥ 5 OCT ILM border ( internal limit membrane ) RPE ( retinal pigment epithelium ) properly identify . Also , initial OCT must confirm repeated measurement day , thickness central point within 10 % measurement . In case OCT image program properly define limit ILM RPE , investigator obtain estimate thickness manual OCT central point least 300 micron , patient consider eligible . The distance visual acuity well eye correct study must index 70 35 letter inclusive ( Snellen equivalent 20/40 20/200 ) . Clear medium eye pupil dilation adequate allow fundus photography good quality . Intraocular pressure exceed 21 mmHg . The ophthalmologist feel comfortable delay focal laser treatment ( direct grid , need ) least 12 week study eye . Patients diabetes Type I Type II define WHO criterion gender age ≥ 18 year . Ability provide write consent . Ability return study visit . Eyes scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) one month prior enrollment , eye scatter photocoagulation require , likely need next 6months ( example , eyes high risk PDR DRS properly treat photocoagulation ) . Presence abnormality likely confound assessment improvement visual acuity eye macular edema resolve improve area hard exudate involve foveal avascular zone ( FAZ involve 2 quadrant center around foveal avascular zone ) , epiretinal membrane associate sign contraction / significant opacification ( ie , striation within diameter disc center fovea ) , presence chorioretinal atrophy involve center macula . Vitreomacular traction determine clinically / OCT , opinion investigator , contribute macular edema ( associate cause detachment fovea ) prevent improvement treatment . Any cause macular edema DME . Atrophy / scar / fibrosis involve center macula , include evidence atrophy treat laser within 200 micron FAZ . Patients receive panphotocoagulation , YAG laser , peripheral retinal cryoablation ( retinal tear ) focal grid photocoagulation within last 12 week treatment focal grid laser . Significant opacity optical medium , include cataract , may interfere visual acuity , assessment toxicity photography background . Patients include high probability require cataract surgery within next year . Any intraocular surgery within 6 month prior study entry . Prior peel epiretinal membrane inner limit membrane . Any major surgical procedure within one month study entry Prior irradiation head region eye study . Any previous pharmacological treatment DME ( include corticosteroid intravitreal , subconjunctival subtenon ) time last 90 day condition . Important known allergy sodium fluorescein dye use angiography . Acute ocular periocular infection .</criteria>
