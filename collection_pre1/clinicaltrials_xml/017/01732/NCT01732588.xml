	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine bioavailability nanoparticulate OZ439 deliver proximal small bowel ( PSB ) via Enterionâ„¢ capsule relative oral OZ439 suspension ( current `` powder bottle '' [ PIB ] ) oral nanoparticulate OZ439 . The study also characterise plasma concentration time profile OZ439 deliver via Enterion capsule PSB comparison OZ439 PIB formulation deliver orally nanoparticulate OZ439 deliver orally Safety tolerability OZ439 formulation determine follow delivery PSB administer orally</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Bioavailability OZ439 When Delivered Directly Small Intestine , Via Oral Route</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous clinical study OZ439 show variable PK food effect . One hypothesis may relate 'common ion effect ' leading precipitation drug less soluble hydrochloride salt stomach , result variable absorption drug . This study design investigate possibility improve PK profile deliver drug directly PSB , thereby bypass stomach . The study compare previously dose PIB formulation oral delivery nanoparticulate caplet formulation . The caplet formulation contain nanoparticulate administer PSB via Enterion capsule .</detailed_description>
