	<brief_title>The HAART 300 Annuloplasty Ring Trial Extended Safety Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic Regurgitation , ( also know Aortic Insufficiency ; AI ) , failure aortic valve close completely diastole cause blood flow aorta back left ventricle . Aortic Regurgitation ( AR ) frequent cause disability death due congestive heart failure , primarily individual forty older , also occur young population . Traditionally management aortic regurgitation aortic valve replacement , however , observed patient mitral valve repair , option maintain one native aortic valve versus replacement , either bioprosthetic mechanical , add multiple benefit . The advantage repair avoidance prosthetic valve-related complication bioprosthetic valve 10-15 year need anticoagulation mechanical valve relate problem therapy .</detailed_description>
