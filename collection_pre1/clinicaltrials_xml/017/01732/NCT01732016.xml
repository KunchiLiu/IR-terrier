	<brief_title>The Camera Oximeter : A Calibration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : We Electrical Computer Engineering Medicine Group ( ECEM ) University British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada , plan make pulse oximetry available resource poor country design low-cost , battery-powered pulse oximeter device . We develop Phone Oximeter , use mobile phone compute analyze information receive pulse oximeter sensor . The use mobile phone patient monitor appeal widely available many develop country . Utilizing battery power , mobile phone rely continuous source electricity . This essential , low-resource setting lack adequate infrastructure thus provide uninterrupted power supply required conventional patient monitoring . Furthermore , mobile phone efficiency , integrate display , process power require analyze store data derive pulse oximeter sensor . Data pulse oximeter transmit referral center diagnostic advisory purpose cellular networking service permit . At present , ECEM Phone Oximeter software run smartphones receives input external proprietary oximeter sensor relatively expensive ( $ 300 US ) . To reduce cost increase ubiquity oximeter , develop two novel pulse oximeter system mobile phone integrate : Audio Oximeter ( AudioOx ) Camera Oximeter . This study aim calibrate Camera Oximeter . The Camera Oximeter use camera mobile phone photo detector . Illumination finger provide integrated flash light . This allow completely eliminating external hardware , allow camera phone become standalone vital sign record device minimal cost ( additional cost phone software ) . This principle apply many mobile phone software application available various software repository measure HR user . Preliminary research show extraction SpO2 video record mobile phone also possible . We extend approach want calibrate validate software implementation approach . Hypothesis : We hypothesize study allow u successfully calibrate Camera Oximeter . Justification : For safety patient , development new pulse oximeter equipment require calibration evaluation accuracy . This required ensure pulse oximeter device functional . Results accuracy evaluation report clinician informed he/she understand limit device he/she use . The International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) technical committee create standard regulate calibration accuracy evaluation procedure pulse oximeter . These standard enforce regulatory body , federal drug administration ( FDA ) , approve medical device use . Pulse Oximeter Theory Calibration The underlying principle pulse oximeters Beer-Lambert law stipulates light intensity diminishes exponentially travel absorb medium . Oxygenated ( O2Hb ) de-oxygenated ( Hb ) hemoglobin different extinction coefficient different wavelength important light absorber blood . In wavelength range , Hb absorbent O2Hb , others absorption property invert . These region separate isosbestic point . With pulse , volume blood vessel optical path length increase , therefore , total absorbance also increase . As result , variation volume register variation transmit light intensity record photodetector . This produce PPG waveform . The difference total absorbance two distinct wavelength allow calculation modulation ratio R. The theoretical relationship R SaO2 describe : SaO2 = ( εHb ( λ1 ) - εHb ( λ2 ) x R ) / ( εHb ( λ1 ) - εO2Hb ( λ1 ) + ( εO2Hb ( λ2 ) - εHb ( λ2 ) ) x R ) The Beer-Lambert law ignore scatter light . Various design aspect individual oximeter ( e.g . photodetector quantum efficiency , probe type ) take account theoretical equation . To account effect , relationship R SaO2 determine empirically use calibration . The calibration pulse oximeter use human subject regulate ISO 80601-2-61 . This standard document defines minimal requirement device , provide classification method system , instruction measure accuracy SpO2 HR , list possible fault condition . The standard document also provide informative recommendation measure accuracy ( Annex CC ) , standard calibration ( Annex DD ) , guideline evaluate document SpO2 accuracy human subject . There standard tool calibrate pulse oximeter . According ISO pulse oximetry standard document , `` today accept method verify correct calibration pulse oximeter probe/pulse oximeter monitor combination test human being . This due complexity optical intricacy interaction light human tissue upon pulse oximetry depend '' . In-vitro calibration device prototype use whole blood suggest various research project , system , to-date , commercially available expensive build operate . They accept standard tool calibration lack simulate tissue interaction pulse oximeter light . It therefore necessary calibrate pulse oximeter human subject . For calibration accuracy evaluation SpO2 measurement , ISO accept two method test : Invasive testing : The SpO2 reading test pulse oximeter compare value arterial blood oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) measure `` gold standard '' blood gas analysis use CO-oximeter . Non-invasive testing : The SpO2 reading test pulse oximeter compare value secondary standard pulse oximeter , use transfer standard calibration directly traceable blood gas analysis . These test conduct healthy volunteer consent induce hypoxemia patient arterial blood samples/reference pulse oximeter reading available . Objectives : Our main objective calibrate Camera Oximeter . We also evaluate accuracy reliability calibration measure SpO2 , respiratory rate , heart rate measurement . Measurements produce two secondary standard pulse oximeter capnometer ( CO2 breath analyzer ) use reference monitor . Research Method : This non-invasive test healthy subject use two secondary standard , clinically approve pulse oximeter . The approved oximeter provide reference measurement SpO2 HR . This least invasive approach recommend ISO standard . Study subject put hypoxic state expose normobaric ( sea-level atmospheric pressure ) hypoxia ( low oxygen ) administrate air mix contain reduce O2 concentration . This achieve hypoxia chamber O2 concentration gradually reduce simulate high altitude ( around 4500 ) . The goal current study similar another study conduct hypoxia chamber ( REB ID # H12-02365 , Calibration evaluation Audio Pulse Oximeter Sensor ( AudioOx ) ascent descent simulate altitude ) , methodology apply . This allow recruiting subject study reduce total number subject necessary achieve goal . Statistical Analysis : Calibration SpO2 Data initial set subject ( least 10 ) study use calibrate Camera Oximeter oximetry data . Firstly , red infra-red ( IR ) light signal oximeter sensor use calculate ratio R , R = ( ACRED / DCRED ) / ( ACIR / DCIR ) ACRED ACIR pulsatile component red infra-red light detect oximeter photo detector . DCRED DCIR constant component red infra-red light detect oximeter photo detector . R value pair SpO2 reading reference oximeter take time . Linear regression second order polynomial equation use estimate calibration parameter . Evaluation SpO2 Readings later subject ( least 10 ) use evaluate accuracy validity SpO2 measurement novel oximeter . Paired read test oximeter reference oximeter group six range ( 70-75 % , 76-80 % , 81-85 % , 86-90 % , 91-95 % 96-100 % ) . Mean bias , precision accuracy calculate per ISO definition group SpO2 range overall range ( 70-100 % ) [ 5 ] . Local bias , b , difference expectation test result ( SpO2 ) accept reference value ( SR ) . For pulse oximetry , , give value reference SpO2 , difference y-value regression line coordinate y-value line identity , plot SpO2 versus SR , give : Local bias , bi = SpO2 fit , − SRi SpO2 fit , value curve fit test data ith reference SpO2 value , SRi . Mean bias , B , mean difference test reference value , preserve sign ( average local bias value ) : Mean bias , B = ( ∑i=1 n ( bi ) ) /n Precision closeness agreement independent test result obtain stipulated condition , define standard deviation residual ( Sres ) , give : Precision , Sres = √ ( ∑i=1 n ( SpO2i - SpO2fit , ) ^2 ) / ( n-2 ) ) n number data pair sample within range interest ; ( SpO2 , − SpO2 fit , ) difference ith SpO2 datum value fit curve correspond ith reference SpO2 value , SRi . Accuracy pulse oximeter shall state term root-mean-square ( rms ) difference measure value ( SpO2 , ) reference value ( SRi ) , give : Accuracy = √ ( ( ∑i=1 n ( SpO2i- SRi ) ^2 ) /n ) To express ACCURACY relative `` gold-standard '' blood gas analysis , error secondary standard pulse oximeter ( errorref ) include , thereby : Accuracycorrected = √Arms^2 + error ( ref ) ^2 Evaluation HR Readings later subject ( least 10 ) use evaluate accuracy validity HR measurement novel oximeter . Paired HR read test oximeter reference oximeter group four range ( 40-65 , 66-90 , 91-115 , 116-140 beat per minute ( bpm ) ) . Mean bias , precision accuracy calculate per ISO definition group HR range overall range ( 40-140 bpm ) , detail previously SpO2 .
