	<brief_summary>Breast cancer heterogeneous disease classify several distinctive subgroup . Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) define lack estrogen ( ER ) , progesterone ( PR ) immunoreactivity lack human epidermal receptor-2 ( HER2 ) overexpression . TNBC comprise around 15 % breast cancer characterize aggressive clinical behavior insensitivity toward available targeted treatment strategy endocrine anti-HER2 therapies.Although TNBC sensitive chemotherapy , early relapse metastatic disease common prognosis poor . Development Of novel treatment strategy , therefore , need study potential target TNBC , like tyrosine kinase receptor , topic interest . Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase encode cell erythroblastosis virus oncogene B1 ( C-erbB1 ) belong HER/Erythroblastosis virus oncogene B ( ErbB ) family . By several signal pathway , EGFR regulate cell proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , invasion , angiogenesis , serve poor prognostic factor.EGFR overexpressed variety malignancy include TNBC.Gene expression profile immunohistochemical study indicate 40 60 % TNBCs exhibit EGFR expression gene amplification find 18 % subgroup , EGFR mutation rare TNBC . By far , role gefitinib , EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , metastatic TNBC identify . Most clinical trial EGFR TKIs breast cancer one limitation including:1 ) study population receive heavily pretreatment ; 2 ) enrol patient include several subgroup breast cancer ; 3 ) expression EGFR clear enrol patient . Here , investigator launch prospective clinical trial , 50 patient triple-negative , EGFR positive metastatic breast cancer receive least second line therapy enrol . patient treat gefitinib , toxicity effect gefitinib record prospectively evaluate role gefitinib metastatic TNBC .</brief_summary>
