	<brief_summary>Age-related cataract main cause impaired vision elderly population worldwide . In UK , half people 65 cataract development one eye . The treatment restore functional visual ability cataract surgery opacified crystalline lens remove phacoemulsification artificial intraocular lens implant . It estimate around 10 million cataract operation perform around world year . Cataract operation generally successful , low risk serious complication . The common risk develop condition call posterior capsule opacification ( PCO ) , cause impaired vision return . During past two decade , cataract surgery underwent tremendous change modernisation result today 's small incision phacoemulsification surgery safe technique short rehabilitation time patient . The frequent long-term complication cataract surgery remain posterior capsule opacification ( PCO ) . In past year , refinements surgical technique modification IOL design material lead decrease incidence PCO . It show sharp posterior optic edge inhibits migration lens epithelial cell ( LEC ) behind IOL optic therefore low incidence posterior capsule opacification ( PCO ) . Most IOL design open-loop haptics connect optic towards end production process , also call multipiece design . For several reason well ease use injector system higher efficiency production process , company develop IOLs open-loop haptics one block material , also call single-piece design . In case single-piece IOLs , haptics tend much thicker multipiece IOLs . A potential drawback thick haptics maybe incomplete closure capsule optic rim reduce bend effect posterior capsule around posterior optic edge . Additionally , posterior sharp edge often discontinuous region haptic-optic junction . These location may serve scaffold LECs migrate behind IOL optic result PCO . Nowadays multitude different single piece IOLS available , many similar course difference regard chemical composition acrylic material IOL design . The purpose study compare intensity posterior capsule opacification ( PCO ) two different 1-piece foldable hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens ( IOLs ) period 3 year .</brief_summary>
