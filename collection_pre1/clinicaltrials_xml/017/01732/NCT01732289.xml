	<brief_summary>Age-related hearing loss , presbyacusis , one common chronically handicapped condition elderly . Many factor include genetics , diet , disease , drug , socioeconomic factor environmental variable consider related development presbyacusis . Evidences show genetic factor play important role presbyacusis . However , gene genotype associate presbycusis remain unknown . The aim project evaluate association genotype candidate gene presbyacusis cross-section case-control study . In first stage , investigator plan select 700 healthy subject older 50 symmetric , sensorineural hearing loss . The subject receive basic otologic examination , pure tone audiometry , questionnaire , genotype analysis . Because gender age would affect hearing loss significantly , The investigator convert hear level subject gender age independent Z-score accord ISO 7029 standard . And , The investigator define subject within high 30 % Z-score presbyacusis group , subject within low 30 % Z-score control group . Finally , The investigator perform Chi square analysis test association genotype candidate gene combination group , calculate odds ratio presbyacusis different genotype candidate gene . Further , evaluate effect genotype candidate gene , environment factor , gene-environmental interaction severity presbyacusis multivariate logistic regression . In second stage , The investigator wish know pattern genotype hearing level high risk family , accord result first stage , description case-control study . The investigator perform t-test evaluate difference Z-score group . Besides , The investigator try evaluate effect genotype , environment factor , gene-environmental interaction hear level high risk family multivariate logistic regression .</brief_summary>
