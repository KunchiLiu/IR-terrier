	<brief_summary>Physical exercise training appear effective low moderate patient assign cardiac rehabilitation . However , adherence cardiac rehabilitation low physical activity level often drop attend last supervised rehabilitation session . This study compare home base physical exercise training include telemonitoring regular centre base physical exercise training . Main outcome measure change physical activity change physical fitness ( peak Oxygen uptake ) initial rehabilitation period ( 12 week ) 1 year . Secondary outcome measure cost-effectiveness , train adherence , health-related quality life patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Homebased Training With Telemonitoring Guidance Low Moderate Risk Patients Entering Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical training beneficial effect exercise capacity , cardiac function , quality life mortality patient acute cardiovascular syndrome cardiac surgery therefore one main aspect cardiac rehabilitation . However , adherence therapy low effect tempt decrease directly treatment period . The objective study compare effect home-based exercise training ( HT ) telemonitoring guidance regular centre-based exercise training ( CT ) physical fitness ( PF ) , assess peak oxygen uptake , physical activity ( PA ) , assessed physical activity energy expenditure ( PAEE ) , low moderate risk cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) patient . Secondary endpoint cost-effectiveness , train adherence , health-related quality life ( QoL ) patient satisfaction . Single-centre randomize control trial . CR patient randomize HT ( n=45 ) CT ( n=45 ) . Assessments perform baseline , 12 week 1 year , consist maximal exercise test respiratory gas exchange analysis , assessment PAEE , QoL ( also 6 month ) , patient satisfaction ( 12 week ) health care cost ( 12 week , 6 month 1 year ) Study population : Low moderate risk patient enter outpatient CR acute coronary syndrome revascularization internet access PC home . 12-week training program ( 24-36 one-hour session ) 70-85 % maximal heart rate ( HR ) . In CT group training supervise physical therapist ; HT group training perform home environment use HR monitor determine training intensity weekly feedback / motivation exercise specialist access online HR-data . After 12 week , subject HT group encourage continue use HR monitor . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary endpoint : PF ( peak oxygen uptake ) PA ( physical activity energy expenditure , PAEE ) assess tri-axial accelerometer HR monitor . Secondary endpoint : training adherence , QoL ( SF-36 ) patient satisfaction ( CQ index ) . Exercise training perform patient Acute Coronary Disease ( ACS ) revascularization , classify low moderate risk , consider safe . The training program use study evaluate similar population elderly cardiac patient without document harmful effect . In order reduce potential risk exercise train patient perform maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test baseline , exclude patient myocardial ischaemia ventricular arrhythmia exercise . The first three training session supervision train physiotherapist clinical setting . The patient receive heart rate monitor accelerometer use home . These monitor develop optimize cause minimal physical discomfort non-invasive . During measurement period , patient ask wear monitor continuously 5 day note physical activity perform . The HT group use HR monitor physical training well .</detailed_description>
