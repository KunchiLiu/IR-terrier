	<brief_title>The Effects Virtual Reality Ultrasound Training Pairs Compared Training Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound become increasingly use many medical specialty . However , quality ultrasound examination highly operator dependent sufficient training clinician challenge . Virtual Reality ultrasound simulation enable train control condition allow trainee make mistake practice patient . However , type training expensive due cost simulator clinician supervisor provide instruction feedback trainee practice . Training pair , also know dyad training , may provide learn advantage trainee due share memory increase confidence . Moreover , dyad training allow train twice number trainees simulator , implication cost-effectiveness VR simulation . In study , examine non-inferiority dyad training compare effect traditional training base clinician instruction use VR ultrasound simulator . Methods Study design . A randomized observer-blinded non-inferiority study train pair compare train alone VR simulator . Pilot study . Two pilot study conduct determine module include train curriculum provide standardize instruction trainee . The first pilot study include 10 OB/GYN resident 10 OB/GYN consultant , rat commented module regard useful pelvic ultrasound training . These rating use develop train curriculum consist series basic gynecologic training module . The second pilot study include 6 medical student , half train pairs half train alone clinician instruction . This enable research team develop template instruction provide clinician instructor group participant practice alone . Participants . Year-six medical student final rotation enter residency enrol study . The exclusion criterion previous ultrasound course extra-curricular ultrasound training . 30 participant enrolled ensure least 24 complete transfer test . Setting . All participant train VR ultrasound simulator ( Scantrainer , Medaphor ) OB/GYN clerkship site . The Scantrainer high-fidelity vaginal ultrasound simulator provide haptic feedback realistic imaging . Randomization . All student randomize either train pair train alone . Randomization conduct different clinical department use computer-generated list random number . Intervention . All student receive 30 minute introduction simulator include short introduction vaginal ultrasound examination . The simulator instruction provide use standardized template develop pilot study . Constructive feedback provide participant encounter problem want feedback . The instructor clinician ultrasound simulation expert . The participant intervention group receive continuous instructor support allow consult instructor whenever participant encounter module could pass . The total training time two hour group . Hence , participant dyad group receive half 'hands-on ' time participant control group . Outcome measure . The outcome measure ultrasound examination skill pelvic ultrasound examination patient ambulatory set . Participants ask perform systematic ultrasonic transvaginal examination include measurement endometrial thickness estimate volume right ovary . All patient require provide write consent participate . A blinded gynecologist rat performance use previously validate rating scale . Sample size calculation . Based previous construct validation study , difference performance score correspond two month clinical experience regard significant , correspond 4.6 % difference . Using SD 0.2 , power 0.80 alpha 0.05 , total number participant require 24 .</detailed_description>
