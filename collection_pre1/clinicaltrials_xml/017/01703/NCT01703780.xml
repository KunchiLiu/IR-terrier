	<detailed_description>Hypertension still one major preventable risk factor cardiovascular well cerebrovascular disease globally , include ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , renal impairment . Despite knowledge hypertension availability effective antihypertensive medication progress dramatically recent year , rate uncontrolled hypertension ( reach 90 % ) remain high China [ 1 ] . Among uncontrolled hypertension，it report 8.9 % individual hypertension , 12.8 % hypertensive drug-treated population [ 2 ] attribute resistant hypertension . Resistant hypertension define AHA high blood pressure ( BP ) spite appropriate lifestyle intervention treatment three different type antihypertensive drug optimal dose , include least one diuretic [ 3,4 ] achieve adequate BP control optimal dose 4 antihypertensive drug . At present , many specifically design prospective research concern resistant hypertension available . The prevalence resistant hypertension well establish knowledge resistant hypertension derive cross-sectional analysis clinical trial . The patient resistant hypertension expect server target damage , bad prognosis non-resistant , well establish either literature [ 2 ] . The purpose study determine prevalence resistant hypertension ascertain systemic investigation optimal treatment antihypertensive drug community population clinic well prognosis among patient resistant hypertension compare non-resistant . Subjects：Total 9638 patient hypertension recruit December 31 2015，50 % 5 community screen , 50 % consecutive clinic hypertensive patient . The expected rate resistant hypertension 6 % hypertensive population . Objectives : 1 . True prevalence resistant hypertension In order obtain true burden resistant hypertension , uniform definition resistant hypertension apply , AHA definition [ 4 ] , `` high blood pressure ( BP ) remain spite appropriate lifestyle intervention treatment three different type antihypertensive drug optimal dose , include least one diuretic achieve adequate BP control optimal dose 4 antihypertensive drug . 1 . To exclude pseudoresistant hypertension 2 . To avoid inaccurate measurement blood pressure 3 . To make sure patient physicians adherent therapeutic plan lifestyle interventions.The physician comply guideline actively pursue adequate blood pressure patient . Ninety per cent patient take recommend optimal daily dos antihypertensive medication follow-up 6 month well 85 % 2 year ( less 50 % present ) Incidence resistant hypertension TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS This practical clinical trial , specific antihypertensive drug go test trial.The antihypertensive drug select accord guideline . Treatment duration : six month intensive treatment ( optimal dose type drug ) , blood pressure reach goal . The treatment secondary cause hypertension refer pertinent specialist . Appropriate lifestyle intervention always encourage : Nonpharmacological therapy : Reversal lifestyle factor contribute treatment resistance , - DASH diet encourage follow , low salt diet ( ideal goal &lt; 100 mEq sodium/24 h , evaluate 24h urine collection ) , low fat high fibre diet , - weight loss obese overweight , - moderation alcohol intake two drink per day men one drink woman lighter-weight person , - smoking cessation , - regular physical activity . Optimal pharmacological therapy Drug treatment resistant hypertension : - Diuretics : Usually take thiazide , among patient estimate glomerular filtration &lt; 40 mL/min per m2 ( body surface area ) , thiazide diuretic become less effective loop diuretic use instead , furosemide , need least twice daily dose due short half-life . - Aldosterone antagonist , add-on therapy use resistant hypertension : spironolactone 25 mg day . - In order get good adherence antihypertensive drug therapy , well antihypertensive effect less side effect , combination medicine encourage use use class combination follow guideline ASH recommendation ( 2011 ) , choice patient physician . - Renal denervation catheter-based radiofrequency ablation perform trial . 4 . To rule white-coat effect：It report 20 % -30 % patient apparent resistant hypertension refer ambulatory BP monitoring fact normal BP reading [ 5 ] .When patient higher BP level 140 90 mmHg measure physician assess home AMBP ( ambulatory monitoring blood pressure ) call white-coat hypertension . The patient white-coat hypertension less severe target organ damage cardiovascular risk persistent elevate blood pressure ambulatory monitoring . 5 . Reversing contribute lifestyle factor high blood pressure . - Obesity - High dietary salt intake ( control 6 gram daily possible ) . - The recognition avoid common contribute factor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use , oral contraceptive hormone - The recognition treatment progressive renal impairment . 6 . To rule carefully potential reversible cause hypertension medical history , physical examination , biochemical evaluation , and/ non-invasive imaging . If diagnosed， pertinent therapy give secondary hypertension : - Sleep apnoea - Primary aldosteronism , report prevalence approximately 20 % resistant hypertension [ 6 ] - Renal parenchymal disease renal artery stenosis - Aortic coarctation - Cushing syndrome - Pheochromocytoma 7 . Biochemical evaluation , include serum sodium , potassium , glucose , creatinine ( creatinine clearance ) ; plasma aldosterone renin activity . 8 . 24-h urine collection estimate dietary sodium , potassium , aldosterone excretion . Testing urinary plasma metanephrines/catecholamines indicate pheochromocytoma suspect 9 . Non-invasive image mandatory suspicion renal artery stenosis , adrenal adenoma/tumour , parenchymal renal disease aortic coarctation 2 . Target damage resistant hypertension : 1. leave ventricular hypertrophy : ECG echocardiography 2. periphery artery disease : ABI , carotid 3. kidney function : urinary microalbumin , cystatin C , creatinine eGFR 4. coronary heart disease 5 . Stroke 3 . Prognosis : hard endpoint : acute coronary syndrome ( include unstable angina , fatal non-fatal myocardial infarction ) , stroke , cause death , cardiovascular death Major modification follow : 1 . Recruitment status : total 9638 patient hypertension recruit July 31，2015 . In order observe treatment resistance , 6 month-treatment period need , recruit postpone December 31 , 2015 , treated-resistant hypertensive diagnose full-dose antihypertensive treattment 6 month ( December 31,2015 ) . 2 . Target Follow-Up Duration : accord modify protocol PI scientific committee study , approve ethic committee , study divide two stage : Stage-1 : study prevalence treated-resistant hypertension , December 31 2015 . Stage-2 : follow extend 3 year investigate association genetic risk factor well pharmacoepigenomic change antihypertensive drug-related metabolism enzyme drug receptor clinical phenotype , include primary clinical endpoint , total death , cardiovascular death , acute myocardial infarction , stroke ; secondary clinical event : rate resistant hypertension , target organ damage , leave ventricular hypertrophy , chronic kidney disease.Financial funding support Qingdao HuangHai pharmaceutical.co. , LTD. 3 . Intervention Since practical clinical trial , patient allow receive follow antihypertensive drug dosage adjustment base JNC-cited clinical trial also recommendation JAMA [ 7 ] . - Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor : Captopril , Benazepril , Enalapril , Perindopril , Lisinopril - Angiotensin II receptor antagonist : Candesartan Cilexetil , Valsartan , Telmisartan , Irbesartan , Olmesartan - β-blockers：Atenolol , Metoprolol，Bisolol - Calcium channel blocker : Nifedipine , Amlodipine - Diuretics : Hydrochlorothiazide , Indapamide Treatment-Resistant Hypertension define blood pressure still 140/or 90 mm Hg take 3 different class antihypertensive drug 6 month 6 month , include one diuretic hydrochlorothiazide indapamide take 4 4 different class antihypertensive drug . At stage-1 study , investigate prevalence treated-resistant hypertension . But , mechanism treated-resistant hypertension clarify . Previous study show total 248 drug metabolism pathways know CYP involvement . Of 57 putatively functional human CYPs dozen enzyme , belong CYP1 , 2 , 3 family , responsible biotransformation foreign substance include 70 % -80 % drug clinical use [ 8 ] . We hypothesize resistance result either epigenomical modification gene encode enzyme related drug metabolism gene encode drug receptor genomic variant cardiovascular disease ( GWAS study provide ) . To test hypothesis , propose epigenomic-modified target DNA methylation gene encode metabolism enzymes receptor antihypertensive drug . Target-1 CYP2D6 , involve quarter total clinical use drug metabolism，40 % use treat cardiovascular disease . Other important CYP 450 enzyme target involve cardiovascular drug metabolism CYP3A family , CYP2C family [ 8 ] . For epigenomic study , patient allow receive one follow antihypertensive drug dosage adjustment base JNC-7 cite clinical trial recommendation JAMA [ 7 ] . The following antihypertensive therapy use . - Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor : Captopril , Benazepril , Enalapril , Perindopril , Lisinopril . - Angiotensin II receptor antagonist : Candesartan Cilexetil , Valsartan , Telmisartan , Irbesartan , Olmesartan . - β-blockers：Atenolol , Metoprolol，Bisolol . - Calcium channel blocker : Nifedipine , Amlodipine . - Diuretics : Hydrochlorothiazide , Indapamide . Sample：Peripheral white blood cell . Sample collection：Before antihypertensive drug , well year 1 , 2 , 3 antihypertensive drug therapy ( Time series non-equivalent control group designs（multiple time series design ) .</detailed_description>
