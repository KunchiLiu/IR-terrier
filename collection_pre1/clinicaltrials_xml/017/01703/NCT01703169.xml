The investigator hypothesize patient moderate severe aplastic anemia , treatment eltrombopag lead few platelet transfusion , red blood cell transfusion , few bleed event . The investigator hypothesize patient moderate severe aplastic anemia , eltrombopag acceptable toxicity rate &lt; 3 % , dose result increase platelet count . Finally investigator hypothesize plasma eltrombopag level peripheral blood correlate improve platelet count .</brief_summary>
