	<criteria>Patients may enrol mild impairment ( demented ) group follow criterion meet : 1 . Males females ≥ 50 &lt; = 90 year age . 2 . Have cognitive decline verify study partner cognitive impairment verify study physician . 3 . Have study partner provide separate consent willing accompany patient study visit . 4 . Have MMSE score 24 30 inclusive . 5 . Can tolerate 10minute PET scan . 6 . Have ability cooperate comply study procedure . 7 . Have enrol physician less high confidence diagnosis patient relate cognitive decline time enrollment . 8 . Ability provide inform consent study procedure . Patients may enrol dementia group follow criterion meet : 1 . Are male female ≥ 50 &lt; = 90 year age . 2 . Meet clinical criterion dementia . 3 . Have caregiver provide separate consent willing accompany patient study visit . 4 . Have MMSE score 16 24 inclusive . 5 . Have receive clinical examination and/or laboratory test result strongly indicate nonneurodegenerative cause patient cognitive impairment . 6 . Can tolerate 10minute PET scan . 7 . Have ability cooperate comply study procedure . 8 . Have enrol physician less high confidence diagnosis patient relate cognitive decline time enrollment . 9 . Ability provide inform consent study procedure . ( If patient incapable give informed consent , patient 's legal representative may consent behalf patient patient must still confirm assent . This person may serve study partner well ) . Patients exclude enrollment : 1 . Have current serious unstable illness ; 2 . The patient enrol physician know result previous amyloid image scan ; 3 . The patient know brain lesion , pathology alternative diagnosis strongly explain patient 's clinical presentation ; 4 . Are receive investigational medication , participate trial investigational medication within last 30 day ; 5 . Have ever participate experimental study amyloid target agent ( e.g . antiamyloid immunotherapy , γ secretase β secretase inhibitor ) unless document patient receive placebo course trial ; 6 . Have radiopharmaceutical imaging treatment procedure within 7 day prior study image session ; 7 . Are females childbearing potential surgically sterile , refrain sexual activity use reliable method contraception . Patients also exclude enrollment enrol physician : 1 . Does consider Alzheimer 's disease potential cause patient 's cognitive decline . 2 . Is primary physician take care patient respect management cognitive impairment . 3 . Can categorize patient either : ) document complete evaluation cognitive decline within past 18 month old ; b ) currently undergo evaluation cognitive decline . 4 . Is unwilling suspend test evaluation procedure time baseline evaluation enrol physician 's diagnosis management plan time completion PET scan .</criteria>
