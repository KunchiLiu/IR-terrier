	<brief_summary>TCOM multicentre prospective cohort study patient undergo low limb amputation . Patients provide oxygen carbon dioxide measurement low limb 20 30 minute surgery follow 6 month surgery . The purpose TCOM study determine ability oxygen carbon dioxide measurement legs patient undergo low limb amputation predict wound heal complication determine optimum cutoff value oxygen carbon dioxide level beyond heal complication likely occur close amputation level indicate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lower limb amputation serious unfortunate outcome many patient vascular disease , especially diabetes . It result significant decrease aspect quality life . The need surgery revise amputation proximal level lead increase potential serious life-threatening complication , well decrease patient morale . From survey background literature , estimate approximately 8600 vascular disease-related low limb amputation Canada year . As epidemic diabetes continue unfold mean age population increase , number expect increase . The result study may significantly assist surgical clinical care patient population provide clinician mean assess appropriate low limb amputation level . Further , modalities transcutaneous measure may assist guide intervention study higher risk patient improve clinically important outcome . This study act part feasibility trial randomize control trial assess efficacy supplemental oxygen therapy , include hyperbaric oxygen therapy , therapeutic tool increase rate heal low limb amputation .</detailed_description>
