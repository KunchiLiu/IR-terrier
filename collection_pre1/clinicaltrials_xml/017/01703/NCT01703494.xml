	<brief_summary>There alarm increase incidence severity Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) North America past decade . Relapsing infection common problem patient treat CDI , often require prolong expensive course oral vancomycin limited alternative treatment option .

	<brief_title>Fecal Transplant Relapsing C. Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile increasingly common infection . The number hospital discharge C. difficile list first diagnosis double 2000 2003 . In addition occur frequently , epidemic serious case refractory therapy high rate colectomy death . Most commonly , C. difficile infection ( CDI ) associate use antimicrobial agent think alter normal bacterial flora gastrointestinal tract permit colonization and/or proliferation toxin elaboration C. difficile . Though precise mechanism occurs still incompletely understood , depletion physiologic microflora , particular Bacteroides specie may play important role . Most patient CDI respond course oral metronidazole vancomycin , however , 20 % patient relapse initial treatment . Current guideline recommend taper course vancomycin second recurrence , however 60 % patient still respond treatment strategy develop recurrence vancomycin stop . Use antimicrobials treat CDI may predispose patient relapse maintenance disturb intestinal flora may contribute emerge problem drug resistance . `` Fecal Microbiota Transplantation '' ( FMT ) novel treatment approach involve administration feces healthy ( donor ) individual patient relapse CDI promote recolonization miss component normal intestinal flora . Numerous case report retrospective case series suggest benefit FMT patient severe recurrent CDI cure rate high 100 % mean cure rate 89 % nearly 300 case report world literature . Although efficacy document case report , date publish prospective clinical trial FMT CDI . The propose study would first randomize , double-blind , placebo ( sham ) control clinical trial determine whether FMT deliver colonoscopy effective preventing relapse patient suffer least 3rd recurrence CDI despite receive standard treatment . The investigator hypothesize FMT superior placebo prevent relapse treatment CDI vancomycin . As result study , investigator preliminary efficacy data novel treatment approach recurrent CDI . The investigator well prepared test efficacy FMT future multicenter clinical trial . This research advance clinical care , potentially impact protocol treatment relapse C. difficile infection worldwide . This proposal include collaboration investigator capable perform microbiome analysis specimen collect part trial understand intestinal microflora health disease .</detailed_description>
