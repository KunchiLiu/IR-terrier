	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution Subjects With Severe Night Vision Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number people acceptable uncorrected best-corrected daytime vision experience night vision complaint , whether people 'night myopia ' , people Intraocular Implants ( IOLs ) , cortical cataract , people refractive surgery . Many people corneal lenticular aberration , either naturally occur surgically introduce . For people , pupil dilates dim light , light ray focus retina , result visual aberration include glare , ghosting , halo starburst . It propose modest pharmacologic reduction pupil size potential mitigate complication many affected individual . The purpose present study evaluate sub-acute effect two dose level PM contrast sensitivity visual acuity 15 day continuous therapy .</detailed_description>
