	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Treating Men With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact cabozantinib marker bone turnover microenvironment men non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compare finding men metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe associate change dynamic histomorphometry baseline 6 week cabozantinib therapy men non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer . II . To characterize , describe , compare effect cabozantinib men non-metastatic metastatic bone disease respect follow measurement baseline therapy : marker bone metabolism blood include bone specific alkaline phosphatase , alkaline phosphatase , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ; change marker apoptosis , proliferation , angiogenesis biopsy specimens bone soft tissue therapy cabozantinib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Radiographic disease responses toxicity monitor patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
