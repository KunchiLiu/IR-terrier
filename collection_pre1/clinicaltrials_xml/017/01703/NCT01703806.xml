	<brief_title>Early Surgery Versus Conventional Treatment Asymptomatic Severe Mitral Regurgitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery definitive therapy severe mitral regurgitation ( MR ) guideline recommend surgery management MR symptomatic patient asymptomatic patient leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction . However , time surgical intervention asymptomatic patient severe MR remain unclear due lack randomize clinical trial compare early surgery versus watchful waiting . The benefit early surgery suggest prospective , observational study , whereas watchful wait strategy seem safe effective prospective study . The consensus guideline performance early surgery asymptomatic patient severe MR different , reflect controversy . The 2006 American College Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) guideline recommend early surgery asymptomatic patient success rate mitral valve repair expect exceed 90 % , 2007 European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) guideline recommend watchful wait patient . Clinical outcome asymptomatic patient MR poorly define important identify high-risk patient early surgery may warrant . Older patient large effective regurgitant orifice ( ERO ) show increase mortality medical management , controversial whether early surgery would improve clinical outcome patient , performance surgery high-risk patient might associate increase operative risk . Although randomized trial require establish indication early surgery , ethical financial constraint allow u conduct randomize trial investigator choose perform propensity analysis large prospective cohort patient . The investigator try compare long-term outcome early surgery conventional-treatment strategy base current guideline large prospective cohort asymptomatic patient severe degenerative MR use propensity analysis , examine hypothesis reduction cardiac mortality cardiac event early surgery particularly evident among patient age &gt; 50 year ERO â‰¥ 0.4 square centimeter . All patient suspect MR undergo transthoracic echocardiography . Entry evaluation include demographic data , clinical presentation , physical finding echocardiographic data . Eligibility determine patient undergoes thorough evaluation clinical echocardiographic data . After eligible patient sign informed consent , entry registry take place . The treatment group randomly assign choice early surgery conventional treatment patient discretion attend physician , explain potential benefit early surgery procedural risk detail considers preference individual patient importantly . Patients early surgery group undergo mitral valve surgery within 6 month enrollment . Patients conventional treatment group treat accord 2006 ACC/AHA guideline educate report immediately study coordinator investigator experience symptom , refer surgery exertional dyspnea , LV ejection fraction &lt; 0.60 , LV end-systolic dimension &gt; 40 mm , Doppler estimate pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 50 mmHg , atrial fibrillation develops . All patient follow 3 month , 6 month , 1 year ; 6-month interval thereafter close-out study , educate call study coordinator investigator experience adverse event . The Executive Committee approve final trial design protocol . This committee also responsible review final result , determine method presentation publication , selection secondary project publication . Members committee include PI person organize study . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review safety data study make recommendation base safety analyse serious adverse event protocol deviation . The Clinical Events Committee meet regularly review adjudicate clinical event occur throughout study period . The statistical analysis perform accord prespecified analysis plan describe study protocol .</detailed_description>
