	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab give together whole brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery treat patient melanoma brain metastasis . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find Tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy , use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy different way may kill tumor cell . Giving ipilimumab together whole-brain radiation therapy stereotactic radiosurgery may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Ipilimumab Combined With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Radiosurgery Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melanoma patient brain metastasis poor outcome . Most patient brain metastasis die CNS related death . Radiation therapy effective treatment patient brain metastasis symptom palliation survival benefit . Patients multiple metastasis typically treat whole brain radiation treatment ( WBRT ) . For patient metastasis , stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) alone use alternative . CTLA-4 ( Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 ) antibody , Ipilimumab show efficacy metastatic melanoma unresectable melanoma . Treatment high dos radiation therapy would result tumor cell death , release tumor debris liberate potential tumor antigen . We hypothesize combine radiation therapy Ipilimumab facilitate immune recognition novel tumor-specific antigen , yield synergistic effect . Further , hypothesis study combination could focus immune system tumor antigens minimize aberrant immune activation normal tissue , consequently reduce incidence irAE 's ( immune relate adverse effect ) . Combination radiation treatment Ipilimumab likely result well local control , decrease risk develop new brain metastasis , improve overall survival . However , safety profile toxicity combine Ipilimumab brain radiation treatment unknown . The current phase I study assess safety profile combine different dos Ipilimumab standard dose radiation treatment either WBRT SRS . The MTD ( maximum tolerate dose ) determine , well recommended phase II trial dose Ipilimumab .</detailed_description>
