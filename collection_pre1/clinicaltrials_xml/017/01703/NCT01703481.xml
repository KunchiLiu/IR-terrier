	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics JNJ-42756493 Adult Participants With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first-in-human , non-randomized ( individual assign chance study treatment ) , open-label ( individual know identity study treatment ) , multicenter ( 1 hospital work study ) , Phase 1 study . The study consist 4 part . Part 1 dose-escalation phase , guide pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics safety . In part 1 , safe biologically active Phase 2 dos ( recommended Phase 2 dos [ RP2D ] ) JNJ-42756493 primarily assess . Participants enrol sequential cohort ( first cohort receive start dose subsequent cohort receive increase dos JNJ-42756493 ) . Part 2 Dose Confirmation Phase , consist pre post treatment tumor biopsy cohort confirm RP2D base pharmacodynamic effect JNJ-42756493 fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) signal pathway tumor . Part 3 first Dose Expansion Phase , design evaluate inclusion biomarkers preliminary clinical activity first RP2D . It consist 4 expansion cohort , 1 squamous cell lung cancer , small cell lung cancer , breast cancer , solid tumor ( Cohorts A , B , C , D ) . Part 4 second Dose Expansion Phase , design evaluate inclusion biomarkers preliminary clinical activity second RP2D . Biomarker eligibility also refine base emerge data . It consist 2 expansion cohort , Cohort E non-small cell lung cancer Cohort F select solid tumor include breast , urothelial , GBM , ovarian , head &amp; neck , esophageal , gastric , cholangiocarcinoma ( Cohorts E F ) . Enrollment cohort may discontinue due lack enrollment futility . The study estimate take approximately 48 month complete . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
