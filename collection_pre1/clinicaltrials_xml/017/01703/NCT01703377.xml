	<brief_summary>A major advantage understand neural control scheme able simultaneously perform multiple task base Uncontrolled Manifold ( UCM ) hypothesis take advantage motor redundancy . The present study aim investigate hypothesis examine effect artificially eliminate knee lumbar-thoracic joint motion postural control arm perform target task simultaneously stand . Subjects ( Younger group : 20~35 year old ; Elder group : 60~85 year old ) execute target task without additional ball-balancing task stand free joint motion restrict joint motion . The investigator expect recruit 50 subject group . Analyses joint configuration variance stability center mass ( COM ) position hand path perform use UCM method variance analysis . This method partition joint configuration variance one component consistent use motor abundance component lead COM position hand path variability . Furthermore , difference young group elder group evaluate .</brief_summary>
