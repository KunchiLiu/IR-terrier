	<brief_title>The Efficacy Jobelyn ( Sorghum Bicolor Extract ) Treatment Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell anaemia inherit haemoglobinopathy cause point missense mutation ( GAG GTG ) beta globin gene result substitution acidic amino acid ( glutamic acid ) neutral hydrophobic amino acid ( valine ) codon 6 beta globin chain . This genetic defect prevalence 20 % 40 % Sub Saharan Africa , 7.8 % African Americans lesser extent Middle East , Mediterranean India . The high frequency sub Saharan Africa think due selective advantage gene confers trait ( heterozygote state ) malaria zone . Nigeria populous country region 24 % frequency mutant gene . The prevalence sickle cell anaemia Nigeria 20 per 1000 life birth . This imply Nigeria may high burden disease world . The severity sickle cell disease varies . The disease severe patient haemoglobin SS haemoglobin S beta thalassaemia haemoglobin S beta+ thalassaemia haemoglobin SC disease . The Arab - Indian haplotype produce less severe disease African haplotype . Similarly , coinheritance one two , alpha globin chain deletion high fetal haemoglobin level hereditary persistence fetal haemoglobin associate mild disease , The severity therefore high Sub Saharan African sub region . However , severity disease vary widely unexplained reason among patient haemoglobin SS region . The beta S globin chain bind valine site complementary hydrophobic effect beta globin chain . This trigger formation polymer haemoglobin . The rate polymerization increase increase intracellular deoxy-haemoglobin . Factors promote polymerisation dehydration , acidosis , increase level 2,3 diphosphoglycerate may occur infection . On hand , association haemoglobin 5 haemoglobin high oxygen affinity-like haemoglobin F haemoglobin A reduce rate polymerisation . The haemoglobin polymer form firm gel damage cellular membrane . The damage membrane cause movement potassium water cell thus lead dehydration polymer formation . This damage also cause negatively charge phosphatidylserine move membrane surface red cell become deformed shape , rigid adherent vascular endothelium . The result easy fragmentation membrane extra vascular haemolysis , complement mediate lysis cell intravascular haemolysis , shorten red cell survival 4 25 day , trap rigid irreversible sickle cell post capillary venule promote leukocytosis , platelet activation inflammatory cytokine . The release intravascular haemoglobin mob nitric acid vasodilatation effect . This aggravate already deficient tissue perfusion . A vicious circle form eventually lead tissue hypoxia , sequestration blood organ sinus ( spleen , liver , lung penis ) . There also chronic haemolytic anaemia insufficient increase production erythropoietin due fact beta S globin chain low affinity oxygen therefore release oxygen easily tissue . To reduce erythropoiesis increase inflammatory cytokine inhibit haemopoiesis i.e interleukin 1 tumor necrotic factor . On hand increase red cell mass tend increase vascular occlusion ischemic crisis . The ideal stable haematocrit sickle cell disease therefore 24 % 28 % . At range haematocrit , tissue hypoxia minimize painful crisis easy control . Factors precipitate crisis dehydration , infection , extreme heat cold physical emotional stress . These factor prevalent environment . Early detection preventive measure important management sickle cell disease . To enhance red cell production , patient offer regular folic acid . To prevent malaria , prophylactic paludrine give infection treat appropriate antibiotic . Among anti sickling drug , hydroxyurea , inhibitor ribonucleotide reductase , show decrease rate painful crises probably reduce adhesion endothelium , increase proportion fetal haemoglobin within cell reduction white blood cell platelet . Other drug trial butyrate compound analogues azacytidine . Other modality blood transfusion , exchange blood transfusion , stem cell transplant possibility gene therapy realistic . These modality without side effect high cost . A new drug add routine drug might minimize tissue . Hypoxia , rate sickling haemolysis haematocrit within steady state range , white cell count reduce inflammatory cytokine reduce . Available report suggest sickle cell erythrocytes susceptible , endogenous free radical mediate oxidative damage indicate marked increase lipid peroxidation superoxide dismutase level haemoglobin SS patient . However remain discrepancy status anti oxidant enzyme vitamins patient . Sorghum bicolor , grain long use Africa high nutritional value also exhibit strong antioxidant property antiinflammatory effect . The traditional preparation Sorghum bicolor oxygen radical absorbance capacity ( ORAC ) OF 3,123 micro mole TE/g . This much high botanical preparation . Complementing antioxidant property , sorghum bicolor also exhibit anti inflammatory effect demonstrate selective COX-2 inhibition , provide effective reduction inflammation without residual side effect . Sorghum bicolor extract show increase haematocrit haemoglobin level reduce white cell count trypanosome brucei brucei induce anaemia experimental rabbit . These effect conclusive within 49 day experimentation . Animals sacrifice administration lethal dose Jobelyn show congestion liver , kidneys lung . This might result direct effect organs sign cardiotoxicity . However wide therapeutic range . Jobelyn proprietary name product intend treat sickle cell disease currently market nutritional supplement . Jobelyn market 250mg capsule Sorghum bicolor leaf extract . The product widely market many country include Nigeria . Many sickle cell patient use regularly long time without report adverse effect . The sorghum bicolor extract expect increase haematocrit ' sickle cell anaemia within short time , reduce leukocytosis sickling therefore reduce vascular occlusion improve tissue perfusion . The selective effect COX 2 moderation inflammatory cytokine expect reduce painful crisis inhibition haemopoiesis .</detailed_description>
