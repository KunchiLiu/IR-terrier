	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people epilepsy epileptic focus , small part brain start point seizure . This focus like irritant inflammation , help cause seizure . People epilepsy affect temporal lobe brain often epileptic focus . Researchers want look epileptic focus use drug attache protein associate inflammation . An imaging study drug show much inflammation area brain seizure start . The drug , call [ 11C ] DPA-713 , test effectiveness people temporal lobe epilepsy . Its effect compare image study give healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To see [ 11C ] DPA-713 show inflammation epileptic focus seizure . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age temporal lobe epilepsy . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants three outpatient visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . The visit last 2 5 hour . - Participants screen physical exam , neurological exam , medical history . Blood sample collect start study . - Participants positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . This scan used look brain chemistry function . The study drug give scan see well show point inflammation brain . Some participant provide additional blood sample PET scan . - Participants also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . This scan look structure brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Translocator protein 18 kDa ( TSPO ) highly express activate microglia reactive astrocyte brain , may , thereby , useful biomarker neuroinflammation . We develop [ 11C ] PBR28 positron emission tomographic ( PET ) radioligand bind TSPO measure density . The purpose study assess new TSPO radioligand , [ 11C ] DPA-713 , compare [ 11C ] PBR28 . Although [ 11C ] PBR28 high vivo specific signal , sensitive high low affinity state TSPO , cause single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) fourth exon TSPO gene . This co-dominant mutation yield three genetic group : HH , HL , LL , H high-affinity form L low affinity form . The frequency L allele approximately 30 % ; thus , frequency LL homozygote approximately 9 % . The affinity PBR28 H L form differs 50 fold ; thus , LL carrier provide measureable signal brain [ 11C ] PBR28 . In contrast , affinity DPA-713 differs four-fold LL carrier provide measureable brain uptake , although diminish comparison HH HL carrier . We recently report [ 11C ] PBR28 binding increase epileptogenic mesial temporal lobe HH HL carrier , use ratio brain uptake ipsilateral contralateral region . This study compare [ 11C ] DPA-713 [ 11C ] PBR28 two way . First , relative robustness absolute quantitation TSPO healthy subject patient epilepsy , use arterial input function pharmacokinetic modeling ? Second , relative sensitivity [ 11C ] DPA-713 [ 11C ] PBR28 detect seizure focus patient epilepsy measure ratio brain uptake ipsilateral contralateral seizure focus . STUDY POPULATION This protocol study total 30 patient epilepsy 30 healthy human volunteer use [ 11C ] DPA-713 . Studies [ 11C ] PBR28 subject perform protocol , include 12-N-0182 ( Positron emission tomography measurement neuroinflammation P-glycoprotein localization-related epilepsy , PI : W. Theodore ) . DESIGN For absolute quantification TSPO , 10 patient epilepsy 25 healthy control arterial blood sample concurrent PET image use [ 11C ] DPA- 713 . Scans healthy subject also use study effect polymorphism bind [ 11C ] DPA- 713 . The subject choose undergo PET scan without arterial line . Most , , subject also scan [ 11C ] PBR28 another protocol . LL homozygote would exclude [ 11C ] PBR28 would include [ 11C ] DPA- 713 . For detection increase TSPO receptor bind epileptogenic focus ratio ipsilateral contralateral region , 20 patient epilepsy study [ 11C ] DPA-713 . Since ratio brain uptake also obtain part absolute quantitation ten patient , ratio brain uptake require additional ten subject , would require arterial catheter . To account dropout data variability , request ceiling 30 epilepsy patient ( 10 arterial line ) 30 control . All subject blood draw genotype TSPO SNP perform vitro radioligand bind TSPO lymphocyte . OUTCOME MEASURES To assess absolute quantitation TSPO [ 11C ] DPA-713 , primarily use two outcome measure : identifiability time stability distribution volume calculate compartmental modeling . By compare data HH , HL , LL , also estimate nondisplaceable distribution volume . To assess sensitivity [ 11C ] DPA-713 localize epileptogenic focus , compare ratio brain uptake medial temporal lobe , ipsilateral contralateral seizure focus .</detailed_description>
