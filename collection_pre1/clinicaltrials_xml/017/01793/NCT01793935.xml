	<brief_summary>Withania somnifera ( WSE ; Ashwagandha Ayurveda ) extract use adaptogen build resistance stress diseases indigenous medical system India century . Modern scientific data WSE indicate several bioactive molecule ( withanolides , withanosides , indosides , withaferin-A , others ) significant immunomodulatory , anti-inflammatory stress reduce property . This study examine whether standardize extract Withania Somnifera ( WSE ; Sensoril® ) improve total , positive , negative symptom , stress patient schizophrenia . The study examine whether WSE reduces PANSS positive negative symptom stress score subject , whether improvement mediate change inflammatory immune index . An additional aim determine patient receive WSE few adjustment psychotropic medication assign placebo . The study examine whether WSE re-balance Th1/Th2 ratio ( cytokine measure ) mediate reduction elevate hs-CRP level . It hypothesize subject whose Th1/Th2 ratios normalize likely great magnitude clinical improvement versus subject whose immune ratio remain unbalanced . The proposal 12-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled RCT WSE add antipsychotic medication approximately 60 patient schizophrenia exacerbation symptom . If efficacy affirm , low cost extract could study , use quite readily across low , middle high income country .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim determine whether standardized extract Withania somnifera reduce psychopathology score ( PANSS total ) stress score ( PSS total ) person schizophrenia ? The study also determine whether WSE reduce measure positive negative general symptom schizophrenia ( PANSS subscale score ) ? Another primary aim determine change antipsychotic and/or psychotropic medication ( lithium , anticonvulsant , antidepressant , anxiolytic agent hypnotic ) ( example : dosage escalation reduction switch stoppage ) favor group receive standardize Withania somnifera extract versus receive placebo . Even though expect change antipsychotic medication occur patient experience exacerbation psychotic symptom ( psychiatric symptom ) , hypothesize receive standardized Withania somnifera extract experience few medication adjustment assign placebo . A secondary aim determine whether WSE rebalance TH1/TH2 ratio ( cytokine measure ) mediate reduction elevate hs-CRP level ? The study ass whether subject whose TH1/TH2 ratios normalize great magnitude clinical improvement vs. subject whose immune ratio remain unbalanced . Similarly , study ass whether reduction hsCRP level correlate improvement PANSS total subscale score PSS total score . Eighty patient DSM IV TR ( institute study initiation : DSM V ) schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder screen 60 eligible patient enrol 12 week placebo control double blind study . Subjects experience exacerbation positive symptom ( delusion , hallucination , etc ) . Subjects receiving medication affect immune-inflammatory system exclude receive antibiotic , antiviral anti-parasitic medication exclude . Base line laboratory EKG examination carry establish eligibility study participation . In addition specific laboratory analysis immune marker namely interleukin-2 , interferon gamma , interleukin-4 , interleukin 6 high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein carry . Sixty patient randomly assign receive either WSE match placebo start 1 capsule 250 mg strength twice day ( total daily dose = 500 mg ) first week increase 2 capsule 250 mg twice daily ( total daily dose = 1000 mg ) total treatment period 12 week . An assessment psychopathology ( PANSS ) stress carry scheduled visit . Assessments safety include vital sign treatment emergent adverse event also carry visit . Immune-inflammatory marker re-assessed final visit .</detailed_description>
