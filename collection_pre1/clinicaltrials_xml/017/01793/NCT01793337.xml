	<brief_summary>Accurate measurement core body temperature scene accident critical diagnosis treatment/triage decision hypothermic patient . Measurement low third oesophagus consider gold standard CT reading , invasive hardly applicable conscious patient . Tympanic membrane sensor CT read widely test may unreliable extreme environmental temperature . Similarly , Double Sensor device non-invasive device promise prehospital use sufficiently verify cold hot environmental condition . Furthermore , comparison different non-invasive method oesophageal measurement extreme condition lack . The objective study compare different technique core body temperature measurement exposure cold hot environment .</brief_summary>
