	<brief_summary>This study collect analyze tissue specimens metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) patient development molecularly profile tissue repository primary purpose maintain patient registry future clinical trial base molecular profile tumor . The main purpose test tissue specimen identify genetic alteration biomarkers associate colorectal cancer new agent ( ) become available , particularly target genetic alterations/biomarkers , participant may offer opportunity take part National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project ( NSABP ) treatment protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NSABP Patient Registry Biospecimen Profiling Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue block primary tumor site uninvolved margin resection ( normal tissue ) consenting patient submit stored NSABP Division Pathology , NSABP Biospecimen Profiling Repository . Tissue specimen use profile molecular characteristic , include actionable mutation commonly identify colorectal cancer . Specimens may interrogate method discover additional mechanism targetable genetic alteration may predict sensitivity resistance drug therapy . The repository populate , maintain , analyze continuous patient recruitment . Patient tumor specimen interrogate characterize individual 's molecular profile . At future date discovery purpose , normal tissue may profile comparison profile tumor tissue . NSABP hold database molecular profile relevant patient information . As agent become available clinical study , particularly match specify profile , treat physician contact patient may offer participation trial via separate consent process . Each NSABP trial define molecular profile entry specific agent ( ) study . The MPR-1 patient registry tissue repository treatment protocol associate MPR-1 develop part NSABP Oncology-Genome Assessment Guided Medicine ( N-GAMe ) Program . This registry repository platform use translational science approach personalize therapy patient mCRC . This analysis provide individual molecular profile attempt direct patient 's treatment base pattern genetic alteration . These effort also may aid discovery without new gene target future drug development . Approximately 1000-2000 tumor ( without ) normal tissue specimens live mCRC patient collect , store , analyzed part biospecimen repository . It anticipate 200-400 participant register within first year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must diagnosis metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma . Representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tissue block primary colorectal tumor surgery correspond pathology report must available release local pathology department ( adequate amount tumor tissue require analysis ) . If available release , separate FFPE tissue block uninvolved margin colorectal resection ( normal tissue ) also request . The patient must lifeexpectancy great equal 6 month . History nonCRC malignancy unless patient consider physician diseasefree low risk recurrence . Known comorbid medical condition would preclude investigational treatment ( e.g. , active hepatitis B C ; symptomatic cardiac disease ; renal insufficiency ; bone marrow impairment ) . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude investigational treatment . Colonoscopy biopsies diagnostic core biopsy procedure without surgery resection .</criteria>
