	<brief_summary>Problem : Approximately 4 million live birth occur United States year . Pregnancy cause many physical change mother , include venous distension , increased ability form blood clot , hormonal change . Data suggest factor help cause venous insufficiency ( vein adequately return blood extremity torso ) . As venous insufficiency progress , complication follow , severe include superficial thrombophlebitis deep venous thrombosis ( DVT , blood clot ) . Although fear DVT well publicized , prevention prevalence pregnant woman well-studied . The exact cause venous insufficiency know . However , know risk factor include female hormonal change associate oral contraceptive use , certain hormone replacement medication , pregnancy . Being pregnant place mother additional risk develop venous insufficiency . Compression stocking use manage condition , mean standard care despite easy use safety . The medical community 's understanding compression stocking work largely theoretical ; however , believe compression work prevent venous hypertension lower leg , thereby prevent venous insufficiency associate complication . Research hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize compression stocking use associate low incidence varicose vein , patient already varicose vein , low incidence complication associate venous insufficiency . Further , investigator believe compression stocking use associate low incidence lessening symptom associate venous insufficiency . Importance : An undetected DVT fatal . Even detect promptly , DVT associate long term health problem . Treatment DVT require anticoagulation risky mother fetus . The prevention reduction DVT pregnant woman use compression stocking would revolutionize care . Further , intervention safe noninvasive . The investigator propose conduct randomize , pilot study compare pregnant woman without varicose vein randomize wear compression stocking similar group participant randomize compression stock use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Development Venous Insufficiency Pregnant Women Through Use Compression Stockings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Problem : There approximately four million live birth United States annually . Pregnancy induce multisystemic physiologic change mother body accommodate grow fetus . Known physiologic alteration include venous distension , hypercoagulability , hormonal change . Anecdotal data suggest particular factor precipitate development venous insufficiency . As venous insufficiency progress , complication ensue , severe include superficial thrombophlebitis deep venous thrombosis . Although fear deep venous thrombus ( DVT ) well publicize , prevention actual prevalence pregnant population adequately study . The precise mechanism venous insufficiency yet elucidate . However , several know risk factor exist . They include female gender hormonal change associate elevate progesterone level oral contraceptive use , certain exogenous hormonal replacement medication , pregnancy . Clearly , pregnant state place mother additive risk subsequent development venous insufficiency . Medical management venous insufficiency consist compression stock use , physician recommend use pregnant patient . However , practice mean standard care , despite noninvasive application safety . The precise mechanism compression stocking work largely theoretical ; however , believe extrinsic graduated compression work prevent venous hypertension distal low extremity , thereby prevent venous insufficiency associate complication . Research hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize compression stocking use associate low incidence varicose vein , patient already varicose vein , low incidence complication associate venous insufficiency , particularly superficial thrombophlebitis deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) . Further , investigator believe compression stocking use associate low incidence lessening symptom associate venous insufficiency , edema , fatigue , venous stasis dermatitis , venous neuropathy ( burn ) . Importance : While may feel varicose vein , edema , fatigue , outcomes unimportant , undetected DVT commonly fatal event . Even detect promptly , DVT associate long term morbidity , post thrombotic syndrome occur 30 % patient diagnosed DVT . Treatment DVT require anticoagulation , although essential , carry significant risk mother fetus . The prevention reduction incidence DVT population merely compression stocking use would revolutionize care pregnant population . Further , intervention safe noninvasive . The investigator propose conduct randomize , pilot study compare pregnant woman without ( Group 1 ) ( Group 2 ) varicose vein randomize wear compression stocking ( Treatment Subgroup A ) similar group participant randomize compression stock use ( Control Subgroup B ) .</detailed_description>
