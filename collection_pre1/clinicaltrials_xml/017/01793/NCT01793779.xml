	<brief_summary>Study Objectives 1 . Compare beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate free acid ( HMB-FA ) cold water immersion performance recovery acute bout high intensity resistance exercise . 2 . Compare HMB-FA + Cold water immersion HMB-FA cold water immersion . 3 . Examine effect recovery modalities marker muscle damage , inflammation immune function . Subjects Subjects ( men woman , 18 - 35 ) least one year resistance training experience recruit . Subjects randomly divide one four group : cold water immersion group ( CW ) , HMB-FA , CW+HMB-FA control group ( CT ) . Study Protocol Subjects report Human Performance Laboratory ( HPL ) four separate occasion . On first visit ( T1 ) subject test maximal strength [ one repetition-maximum ( 1-RM ) ] squat , dead lift barbell lunge exercise . ] On second visit ( T2 ) subject perform low body resistance exercise session consist four set squat , dead lift barbell lunge exercise . All subject report back HPL 24- ( T3 ) 48-hours ( T4 ) post-exercise . During T3 T4 , subject perform four set squat exercise use load pattern rest interval length T2 . Following T2 T3 workouts subject CT undergo treatment ; subject CW require sit whirlpool tub 10-min umbilicus water 50째 F - 54째 F ( 10째 C - 12째 C ) ; subject HMB-FA provide supplement 30 min prior workout CW+HMB-FA administer together time point describe . Statistical Analysis Statistical evaluation performance biochemical change accomplish use repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) .</brief_summary>
