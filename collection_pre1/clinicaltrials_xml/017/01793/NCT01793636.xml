	<brief_summary>When kidney cancer spread beyond kidney , know metastatic kidney cancer . This difficult treat almost patient die disease within 2 year diagnosis . Sunitinib related drug ( e.g . pazopanib ) become standard therapy untreated patient metastatic kidney cancer . They target growth factor know VEGF important treat kidney cancer . Although result drug impressive , patient develop resistance drug stop therapy . It currently standard practice give everolimus resistance sunitinib occurs; associate clear clinical benefit . However average time cancer regrowth everolimus 5 month . It think might , everolimus partially inhibits target ( TORC 1 TORC 2 ) . Therefore improvement treat patient require . AZD2014 promise new drug inhibit TORC 1 TORC 2 therefore worthy investigation renal cancer theoretically could may advantage everolimus . Therefore study compare AZD2014 everolimus set everolimus use standard care . ( e.g . patient fail drug like sunitinib ) . The study randomise trial allow u quantify benefit potential development AZD2014 . Repeat Xrays ( CT scan ) use assess new drug delay tumour growth . Patients closely follow clinic ensure safety . A maximum 122 patient recruit multi centre national trial . The primary goal study investigate AZ2014 delay time cancer regrowth ( time progression ) compare everolimus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing AZD2014 v Everolimus Patients With Metastatic Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell cancer , also refer kidney cancer , diagnose approximately 170,000 people worldwide annually , result 82,000 death . Treatment metastatic kidney cancer difficult . Almost patient die disease . In 2006 new drug call sunitinib , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , transform treatment option . It target development new blood vessel within cancer . Although result drug impressive , patient develop resistance median 11 month drug , relapse die renal cancer . It currently standard practice switch everolimus resistance sunitinib occurs; associate clear clinical benefit . POTENTIAL RISKS FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING AZD2014 : The main risk burden patient participate study potential side effect AZD2014 drug . The phase I study use drug complete , therefore know safe administer patient good idea side effect drug cause . But drug give large number , additional side effect may discover . The activity drug evaluate kidney cancer . Therefore sure AZD2014 work POTENTIAL RISKS FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING EVEROLIMUS : Everolimus current standard therapy patient risk associate study drug patient standard care . POTENTIAL RISKS FOR ALL PATIENTS : SIDE EFFECTS : Side effect closely monitor study . Patients required attend clinic weekly first four week every 4 week whilst study medication adverse event record . The patient information sheet include detail expect adverse event patient look also detail unexpected event may occur . Patients provide research nurse principal investigator contact detail adverse event occur course study . Other medical professional inform patient receive experimental drug ( GP letter label hospital record ) . There independent data monitor committee trial closely assess side effect drug regular basis trial result make sure risk excess patient .</detailed_description>
