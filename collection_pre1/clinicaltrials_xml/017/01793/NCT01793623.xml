	<brief_title>Assessment Atrial Tissue Obtained From Patients Undergoing Heart Surgery Tissue Banking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , disorder heart rhythm , epidemic United States , affect nearly 3 million people . AF arise variety setting , often association cardiac disease . Demographic clinical factor utilize profile `` at-risk '' patient , predictive value algorithms low . The reason presumably relate fact factor interact tissue substrate variable way . In addition , correlation provide insight mechanism associate development AF patient without known heart disease , commonplace . Over past decade , technique refine permit enormous amount information relevant disease mechanism gain examination heart tissue . The Cardiovascular Institute extensive experience technique , utilized examine heart disease substrate . In study , propose obtain heart tissue time cardiac surgery would otherwise discard . Our plan examine tissue correlate finding clinical data . Our hope propose study provide insight atrial physiology , include molecular mechanism underlie atrial disease potential development AF . This prospective tissue bank atrial tissue . We propose enrollment 300 subject , take place UPMC Presbyterian 5 year period . Subjects recruit among patient refer non-emergent surgery heart standard indication . The patient 's medical record review health information record include limited demographic , heart disease history , past medical history , lab work , drug therapy , cardiac test patient undergone prior surgery . Patients undergo surgery residual atrial tissue would otherwise discard ( related cannulation and/or appendectomy ) . Thus , obtain tissue effect flow , duration , outcome operative procedure . Tissue assessment include : - Microscopic histology use standard tissue stain ; - Characterization gene expression . Characterization gene expression perform use multiplicity technique focus DNA , RNA proteins produce various cell comprise atrial tissue . Expression variety gene know important cardiac disease analyze . In addition , expression novel gene previously know relevant heart disease may examine . Tissue assessment data correlate clinical data include preoperative AF history , demographic information , feature medical history , detail cardiac structure/function ( obtain examine preoperative test perform standard indication ) , incidence postoperative AF first arrhythmia diagnosis .</detailed_description>
