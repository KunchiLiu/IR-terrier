	<brief_summary>Background : - Endometrial cancer one common gynecologic cancer . If catch early stage , treat easily . Women type cancer often history irregular menstrual bleeding . They may also abnormal finding gynecologic exam . Pap smear cervical cell collection may able collect cell sample cancer test . However , sample vagina endometrium may produce accurate result . Researchers want collect vaginal endometrial cell sample improve test understand endometrial cancer . Objectives : - To collect vaginal endometrial cell sample study endometrial cancer . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age symptoms abnormal uterine post-menopausal bleeding , abnormal ultrasound finding . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants pelvic exam . Before exam , insert small tampon vagina . The tampon stay place 10 30 minute . The tampon remove collect study . - During pelvic exam , tissue collect uterine line special brush . An additional sample ( biopsy ) collect line . - A blood sample also collect part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer account approximately 47,310 incident case 8,010 related death 2012 . Most endometrial cancer develop slowly progression well characterized precursor , many regress progesterone treatment curable hysterectomy . Thus , early detection endometrial cancer precursor prevent many endometrial cancer reduce mortality . Using DNA methylation profile Polish Endometrial Cancer Study ( PECS ) Benign Reproductive Tissue Evaluation ( BRTE ) Study , identify panel marker strongly specifically link endometrial cancer . Concurrently , develop two sample method detect endometrial cancer precursor via DNA methylation analysis : vaginal tampon endometrial brushing . Preliminary data demonstrate DNA methylation marker detectable tampon endometrial brushing identify woman endometrial cancer . We propose extend effort collect vaginal tampon endometrial brushing 2000 woman increase risk endometrial cancer present Mayo Clinic Division Medical Gynecology . We test candidate panel DNA methylation marker population evaluate clinical performance detect endometrial hyperplasia endometrial cancer . Success project could lead development early detection test , include self-sampling strategy would improve management abnormal vaginal bleeding , endometrial cancer precursor .</detailed_description>
