	<brief_summary>Background : - Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) often treat drug know tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitor , help decrease joint pain swell even result RA remission . However , TNF inhibitor may increase risk serious infection type cancer . - It clear people whose RA remission long time need stay TNF inhibitor remain remission . If stop take TNF inhibitor without symptom come back , spar side effect medicine . Some study show people stay remission stop TNF inhibitor , study confirm . Researchers want see people RA remission TNF inhibitor stay remission without medicine . Also may clinical , image ( MRI , ultrasound ) , laboratory profile help determine patient remain remission stop drug . Objectives : - To see whether RA remission continue discontinue use TNF inhibitor . - To determine clinical , image immunological measurement predict participant flare remain remission discontinue TNF inhibitor . Eligibility : -Individuals least 18 year age RA control TNF inhibitor . We plan randomize 291 patient . Design : - The study seven visit 2 year . Six visit occur first year study , 12 week apart . The final study visit 1 year end treatment phase . - At first visit , participant screen physical exam medical history . They complete questionnaire RA symptom . A blood sample collect . They continue take RA medicine time . - The second visit repeat test first visit . These test confirm RA remission . Imaging study perform hand , wrist , foot , connect joint . After visit , participant stop take TNF inhibitor start injection study drug . This drug either participant 's original TNF inhibitor placebo . - There follow-up visit week 12 , 24 , 36 . Participants medical history joint exam . They also provide blood sample answer question RA symptom . - At sixth visit ( week 48 ) , participant repeat test image study second visit . They stop take study injection . - Continued RA treatment visit decide participant rheumatologist . Participants may take recommended medicine , include TNF inhibitor take study . They also receive questionnaire complete home mail back final study visit . - At final visit ( week 100 ) , participant repeat test image study second sixth visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Remission rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) achievable goal currently available medication , include anti-tumor necrosis factor ( anti-TNF ) agent . However , uncertain patient RA clinical remission treat anti-TNF agent background disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) would remain remission anti-TNF therapy stop . If remission sustain anti-TNF agent , patient may spar potential toxicity cost medication . The Stopping Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Agents Rheumatoid Arthritis ( STARA ) study multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled noninferiority trial test difference time relapse patient RA remission discontinue anti-TNF agent patient RA remission continue anti-TNF agent . The secondary objective study : 1 ) determine discontinuation anti-TNF agent result difference progression joint damage radiograph ; 2 ) determine discontinuation anti-TNF agent result difference physical function , 3 ) identify predictor relapse . Eligible subject RA remission least six month take etanercept , infliximab , adalimumab . An eight-week run-in period prior randomization use confirm remission . Subjects randomize 2:1 ratio receive one two blind treatment : 1 ) match placebo 2 ) currently use anti-TNF agent , respectively . All subject maintain current background DMARD . Clinical assessment perform every 12 week . The primary outcome 48-week relapse-free status . Secondary outcome include change baseline radiographic joint damage score 48 week 100 week , change baseline physical function score 48 week . Subjects relapse week 48 discontinue study medication receive treatment rheumatologist . Blinded treat end week 48 subject follow 52 additional week . This study provide important new information best treatment approach patient RA remission .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study personnel evaluate participant eligibility use checklist inclusion exclusion criterion outline . Clinical information obtain subject interview medical record . At screen visit , potential participant include : Age great equal 18 year Have RA , define 1987 revised American College Rheumatology criterion In sustained clinical remission last 6 month receive treatment either etanercept , infliximab , adalimumab , great equal 1 DMARD ( methotrexate , hydroxychloroquine , sulfasalazine , leflunomide , minocycline , cyclosporine , azathioprine , gold , penicillamine ) . DAS28 le 2.6 visit precede 6 month , least one visit 24 month enrollment . If visit 6 month enrollment , near visit 612 month period enrollment consider DAS28 less 2.6 . Potential participant exclude : Had dose increase antiTNF agent DMARD last 6 month Had change antiTNF agent DMARD last 6 month Treated currently golimumab certolizumab Treated great 10 mg prednisone ( equivalent ) daily last 6 month Treated great 5 mg prednisone ( equivalent ) daily last 3 month Treated intramuscular intravenous corticosteroid last 6 month RA activity Treated anakinra , abatacept , tocilizumab last 6 month Treated rituximab last 12 month Treated investigational RA drug last 6 month Pregnant ( anticipate pregnancy study period ) lactate woman Absence documentation medical record clinical remission last 6 month Unwilling discontinue antiTNF agent Absence documentation negative tuberculin skin test , negative QuantiFERONTB Gold test , treatment latent tuberculosis prior start treatment antiTNF agent Treatment solid malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer within past 5 year , history melanoma hematologic lymphoproliferative malignancy Absence documentation ageappropriate cancer screen time randomization Absence documentation negative hepatitis B serology , absence completion treatment chronic hepatitis B , absence suppressive antiviral treatment Unable provide inform consent Anticipate available able comply schedule study visit Study entry limit gender ethnicity . Children exclude inflammatory polyarthritis develop age 16 consider juvenile idiopathic arthritis RA . Patients develop RA age 17 would eligible , give time need achieve remission , patient would case 18 old time would meet criterion study entry . Participants largely recruit practice study investigator . To identify potential subject , investigator may search roster patient practice patient meet inclusion criterion . The number patient screen reason exclusion tabulate site . Subjects may also recruit physician referral . Information study mail local rheumatologist post NIAMS website . We anticipate selfreferral subject eligible selfreferred subject exclude . During course study , enrollment subject treat particular antiTNF agent may suspend terminate permit adequate representation patient treat 3 antiTNF medication , due problem procure medication , due unforeseen issue .</criteria>
