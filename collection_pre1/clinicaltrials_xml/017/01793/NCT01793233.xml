	<brief_title>Blood Sample Markers Reproductive Hormones Assessing Ovarian Reserve Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare anti mullerian hormone ( AMH ) , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , estradiol ( E2 ) patient baseline cross section control patient 12 month therapy cross section control . II . Describe trajectory AMH , FSH , E2 baseline 12 month completion gonadotoxic cancer treatment . III . Evaluate degree change AMH/FSH/E2 baseline end therapy patient . IV . Evaluate degree recovery AMH/FSH/E2 end therapy 12 month therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe acute ovarian failure ( AOF ) prevalence 12 month post-therapy . II . Collect blood sample future evaluation drug metabolize enzyme polymorphism . OUTLINE : Patients complete menstrual diary document vaginal bleeding undergo blood sample collection baseline , 3rd course chemotherapy , end chemotherapy , 6 12 month post-treatment .</detailed_description>
