	<brief_summary>The incidence colorectal cancer ( CRC ) rise global scale . The number cancer-related death relate CRC also rise alarm level . This picture similarly see Egypt incidence colorectal carcinoma increase annually , moreover , CRC Egypt exhibit alarm characteristic affection much young patient counterpart worldwide . Fortunately , early detection CRC precursor ( adenoma ) show markedly decrease morbidity mortality relate tumor , prompt development robust screen program CRC several western country . The implementation CRC screen program Egypt hamper low compliance patient relatively high cost colonoscopy . There need affordable , non-invasive , simple , accurate socially accept screen test allow program succeed Egypt . Recent study show DNA future target screen test several malignancy . Particularly CRC preliminary study show encouraging result separate DNA methylation marker blood stool . In effort develop screen test criterion state , investigator decide join force 2 large medical center Egypt middle-east : Kasr-Alaini hospital National cancer institute ( NCI ) . The investigator plan test panel 7 DNA methylation marker peripheral blood performance early marker CRC colorectal adenoma . Data study pave way development screen test CRC `` tailor '' Egyptian population , moreover , supply essential data genetic alteration occur CRC Egyptian patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients undergo colonoscopy part clinical care part screen program . Complete endoscopic examination ( caecum ) Adequate colonic preparation Incomplete colonoscopic examination due technical cause e.g . difficult colonoscopy , patient intolerance ( N.B . neoplastic mass cause lumen stenosis exclude . ) Poor colonic preparation obscure adequate mucosal examination . Patients receive treatment CRC and/or adenoma . Patients know malignancy elsewhere ( i.e . noncolorectal malignancy )</criteria>
