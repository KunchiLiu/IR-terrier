	<brief_title>Effects Inspiratory Muscle Training After Lung Cancer Surgery , Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances early detection treatment improve life expectancy surgery lung cancer , live lung cancer frequently associate symptom dyspnoea , decrease physical capacity fatigue several year treatment . Lung cancer ( LC ) surgery associate high incidence postoperative pulmonary complication ( PPC ) , negative impact recovery . Although cause PPC multifactorial , respiratory muscle ( RM ) dysfunction propose associate development PPC , explain change RM mechanics- function due surgery . There scarcity literature impact RM dysfunction surgical functional outcome LC surgery . Aims : describe longitudinal change RM strength patient undergoing lung cancer surgery identify association RM strength functional capacity . Furthermore , evaluate effect inspiratory muscle training recovery respiratory muscle strength high risk patient refer LC surgery . Target population : 88 patient referred lung cancer surgery Department Cardiothoracic Surgery , Aalborg Universityhospital . Design : The core research prospective longitudinal observational study ( study 1 ) ; include randomize control trial , base subpopulation study 1 . Statistical analysis base mixed linear regression model ANOVA . For RCT use generalize estimate equivalent method parametric Fisher´s exact test nonparametric data .</detailed_description>
