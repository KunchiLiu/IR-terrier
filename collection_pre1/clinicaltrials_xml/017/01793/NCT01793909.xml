	<brief_summary>This study plan learn effect type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) exercise blood flow muscle oxygen uptake . This study evaluate &amp; compare exercise function single leg plantar flexion exercise total 45 subject Denver area ( 15 lean control , 15 people T2DM , 15 overweight control subject ) . Differences exercise response people T2DM healthy people help identify disease process T2DM direct future research treatment intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well establish functional exercise capacity peak oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) reduce patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) compare healthy counterpart . The mechanisms underlying exercise deficit T2DM remain largely unknown , previous work suggest reduced exercise blood flow impair submaximal VO2 may contribute factor . Both finding consistent peripheral impairment skeletal muscle oxygen delivery , oxygen utilization , . Indeed , dysfunction skeletal muscle metabolism play key role pathophysiology T2DM , considerable work describe abnormality oxidative function skeletal muscle people T2DM . Given , likely cause exercise intolerance T2DM may relate specific defect level skeletal muscle , particularly give skeletal muscle blood flow oxidative capacity impair diabetes . However , knowledge , one relate peripheral muscle abnormality diminish exercise function patient group . The overarch hypothesis propose research failure adequately increase muscle oxygen delivery follow onset exercise reduce oxidative function skeletal muscle contribute acute oxygen deficit diminish exercise tolerance observe patient T2DM .</detailed_description>
