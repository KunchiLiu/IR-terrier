	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop evaluate adaptive shape intervention base Behavioral Economics Operant principle promote physical activity behavior ( adaptive group ) compare static physical activity intervention ( static group ) use two-group randomize controlled trial design . Participants include 20 overweight men woman ( BMI 25-35 kg/m2 ) 18 55 year . Both group receive follow component : 1 ) pedometer , 2 ) self-monitoring physical activity , 3 ) brief educational material , 4 ) motivational prompt , 5 ) physical activity goal , 6 ) small financial incentive . The Adaptive Intervention ( AI ) group receive adaptive goal feedback base percentile `` move '' window recent physical activity , incentive link goal attainment . Comparison intervention participant receive static 10,000 step per day goal , match incentive amount without incentive link goal attainment . The study compare difference goal set shape procedure aim increase physical activity behavior . Primary aim include : 1 . To determine whether physical activity ( pedometer-measured steps/day ) Adaptive Static intervention increase compare respective baseline . Hypothesis : Both adaptive static intervention result increased physical activity 6 month . 2 . To evaluate whether Adaptive Intervention result great change physical activity ( pedometer-measured steps/day ) compare Static Intervention . Hypothesis : The adaptive intervention result significantly great physical activity , measure pedometer , compare static intervention 6 month . 3 . To assess participant ' satisfaction overall program . Hypothesis : Adaptive Intervention participant report great overall satisfaction intervention Static Intervention participant .</brief_summary>
