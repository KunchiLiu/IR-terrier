	<brief_summary>A combined Phase 1 &amp; 2 study evaluate safety effectiveness new diabetic neuropathy topical cream , contain benfotiamine , perform 5 clinical site plan BC-DN-01 administration 135 volunteer patient use standard Phase 1 + 2 design . Up 15 subject receive BC-DN-01 Study Phase 1 120 subject receive BC-DN-01 placebo Study Phase 2 . In Phase 1 , BC-DN-01 dose deliver 160mg benfotiamine/day ( 80mg twice daily ) administer first 7 day . On visit day 0 , patient commence study treatment . Patients interview phone day 3 return clinic day 7 safety assessment . If drug well-tolerated significant adverse event experience , total daily BC-DN-01 dose increase day 7-14 320mg benfotiamine/day ( 160mg b.i.d. ) . Patients interview telephone day 10 return clinic day 14 safety assessment . Once safety profile determine Phase 1 acceptable , Phase 2 study initiate evaluate clinical efficacy BC-DN-01 . Phase 2 randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel study . Participants receive placebo BC-DN-01 base 1:1 randomization . Each patient apply 4g study medication leg twice-a-day administer 320mg benfotiamine dose/day 12 week . Participants evaluate clinic baseline 4 , 8 , 12-week time point ; study staff interview patient telephone week 2 , 6 , 10 . The primary endpoint phase 2 trial reduction DPN pain measure Brief Pain Inventory .

	<detailed_description>The study perform 5 clinical site plan BC-DN-01 administration 135 volunteer patient use standard Phase 1 + 2 design . Based conservative approximate drop-out estimate 20 % Study Phase 1 30 % Study Phase 2 , 15 subject receive BC-DN-01 Study Phase 1 120 subject receive either BC-DN-01 placebo Study Phase 2 . It anticipate enrolment 135 subject allow 12 84 evaluable Study Parts 1 2 , respectively . Patient screen study eligibility , randomisation , treatment administration , safety efficacy evaluation conduct clinic visit qualify clinical research facility . It anticipate fifteen patient enrol Phase 1 portion study intend evaluate safety tolerability daily , escalate dos BC-DN-01 two week . This portion study blind non-randomized . Upon completion Phase 1 , result use decision initiate Phase 2 portion study . It anticipate one hundred twenty ( 120 ) patient enrol Phase 2 randomize receive either placebo fix BC-DN-01 dose twelve week . Phase 2 double-blind minimize bias . All clinical safety measurement , observation , report adverse symptom , laboratory safety data patient review clinically relevant finding report Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) end Phase 1 end Phase 2 trial . The decision continue trial conduct make BioChemics , Inc. , may base recommendation provide study continuation/study termination opinion DSMB . At time individual patient data commentary thereon , blind Phase 2 portion trial share DSMB BioChemics , Inc. personnel study conduct partner . This study formally power test statistical hypothesis . The primary objective determine magnitude pain relief follow daily administration 16g BC-DN-01 ( 320mg benfotiamine ) compare Placebo ( Phase 2 ) . This value use determine sample size need future clinical trial ensure adequate analytical power demonstrate efficacy . Phase 1 Patients consider eligible enrolment phase 1 study require comply inclusion exclusion criterion , include : - Consented phase 1 trial participation - Met protocol criterion inclusion exclusion ( except inc criterion # 8 , # 9 exc criterion # 3 ) ) - Have take neuropathy pain medication least 2 week Visit 1 ( Screening ) After provide write informed consent patient undergo physical examination , include leg foot assessment , vital sign measure safety blood sample take include serum pregnancy test woman child bear potential . Visit 2 ( Baseline - Day 0 ) Patients undergo physical examination , include leg foot assessment , vital sign measure safety blood sample take include urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential . Patients dispense BC-DN-01 study medication provide 1 week treatment , 2g dos per leg , twice daily give total dose 160mg benfotiamine/day ( 80mg b.i.d. ) . The first dose give study nurse , demonstrate correct way apply cream . If drug well-tolerated significant adverse event experience , total daily body BC-DN-01 dose increase follow clinic visit day 7 ( first increase dose 160mg applied even day 7 ) twice daily day 14 , 320mg benfotiamine/day ( 160mg b.i.d. ) . Visit 3 ( Day 7 ) Patients undergo leg foot assessment , vital sign measure safety blood sample take include urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential . Patients dispense BC-DN-01 study medication provide 1 week treatment , 4g dos per leg , twice daily . Visit 4 ( Day 14 ) Patients undergo physical examination , include leg foot assessment , vital sign measure safety blood sample take include urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential . Patients contact day 3 , 10 21-28 telephone interview discuss medication , general health adverse event since last clinic visit . Phase 2 Once safety profile determine Phase 1 consider acceptable , Phase 2 study initiate evaluate clinical efficacy BC-DN-01 . Patients participate Phase 1 safety evaluation may also participate randomise Phase 2 portion trial , least four ( 4 ) month complete phase 1 trial . At time , patient , require comply inclusion exclusion criterion , include : - Consented phase 2 trial participation - Met protocol criterion inclusion exclusion - Have take neuropathy pain medication least 2 week Phase 2 randomise , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel study 120 patient . Study participant receive either placebo BC-DN-01 base 1:1 randomisation ( least 42 evaluable patient per treatment arm ) . Each volunteer patient apply 4g study medication leg twice-a-day administer 320mg benfotiamine dose/day 12 week . The primary endpoint phase 2 trial reduction pain level associate DPN measure Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) . The duration pain reduction also assess . The secondary efficacy endpoint include evaluation Sural Peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity , Neuropathy Symptom Score , Neuropathy Disability Score , , Intra-epidermal nerve fibre density leg patient , hyperaesthesia change lack sensation leg foot . Xerosis change diabetes-related skin pathology , infiltration inflammatory cell mast cell degranulation well change gene expression profile tissue also assess . Visit 1 ( Screening ) After provide write informed consent patient undergo physical examination , include leg foot assessment , vital sign measure safety blood sample take include serum pregnancy test woman child bear potential . Visit 2 ( Baseline - Day 0 ) Patients undergo physical examination , include leg foot assessment , vital sign measure safety blood sample take include urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential . Patients randomise 50:50 BC-DN-01 : placebo arm dispense study medication provide 4 week treatment , 4g dos per leg , twice daily give equivalent total dose 320mg benfotiamine/day ( 80mg b.i.d. ) . The first dose study medication give study nurse , demonstrate correct way apply cream . Visits 3 ( Week 4 ) 4 ( Week 8 ) 5 ( Week 12 ) Patients undergo leg foot assessment , vital sign measure safety blood sample take include urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential . Patients ask complete questionnaire regard DPN pain , sensory test visual assessment skin legs foot make Patients undergo nerve conduction velocity test , test fast electrical signal move nerve leg . Patients contact week 2 , 6 , 10 14 telephone interview discuss medication , general health adverse event since last clinic visit .</detailed_description>
