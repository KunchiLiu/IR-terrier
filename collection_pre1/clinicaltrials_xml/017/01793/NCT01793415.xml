	<detailed_description>Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS , also sometimes call ME , Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ) devastate complex disorder . People CFS experience overwhelm fatigue host symptom improve bed rest get bad physical activity mental exertion . They often function substantially low level activity capable become ill . Besides severe fatigue , symptom include muscle- joint pain , impaired memory mental concentration , insomnia , post-exertion malaise last 24 hour . Often , CFS persist many year . Researchers yet identify cause CFS , specific test diagnose CFS . The prevalence suggest around 1-2 % . All human expose small amount mercury every day environment . It well-known exposure mercury small quantity long time affect psychic function , cause severe fatigue , insomnia , lack concentration memory problem , call micromercurialism . It also known sensitivity toxic effect mercury differs greatly people . Thus , quite possible small amount mercury human expose daily sufficient lead micromercurialism symptom sensitive individual . Therefore , question arises reduction mercury content body CFS patient improve symptom problem daily life . This study examine mercury bind substance IodoCarb ( r ) improve health patient CFS . This double blind placebo control parallel group study . Patient population : 40 patient diagnose CFS participate .</detailed_description>
