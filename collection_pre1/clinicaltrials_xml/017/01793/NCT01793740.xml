	<brief_summary>The majority school-age child sickle cell disease ( SCD ) experience neurocognitive deficit , even absence stroke . In particular , deficit attention work memory emerge two common neurocognitive sequela SCD . Thus , goal present proposal address feasibility compliance novel computerized cognitive training program , Cogmed . Pilot data also collect establish preliminary efficacy . Twenty-four child meet initial age diagnostic criterion identify approached participation attend physician regularly-scheduled SCD clinic visit . Baseline assessment include brief measure intellectual functioning , brief cognitive test battery evaluate process speed work memory , addition questionnaire regard behavior quality life . Children randomize computerized CT program Cogmed ( n=12 ) waitlist control ( n=12 ) . Participants enrol computerized CT program ask complete 25-sessions Cogmed five eight week period ( 3 5 session per week ) . Following completion program , child parent ask return clinic follow-up visit . After five eight-week wait period , child waitlist condition also ask return clinic second visit . Following assessment , participant initially enrol waitlist offer opportunity participant intervention . If interested , follow intervention protocol describe . These child return clinic third visit follow completion intervention . Compliance rate confidence interval calculate overall study population . A t-test binomial proportion continuity correction use examine whether compliance rate lower target . Participants ' change criterion outcomes evaluate ( i.e. , neurocognitive measure attention , executive function work memory , closely related trained task ) .</brief_summary>
