	<brief_summary>Raltegravir ( RAL ) prefer option initial antiretroviral therapy recent HIV Treatment Guidelines emerge popular choice use specialized population HIV-infected patient consider solid organ transplantation . Data HIV-infected person normal organ function reveal raltegravir-associated metabolic complication compare old antiretrovirals , general , drug-drug interaction raltegravir infrequent . The absence concern appear make raltegravir potentially appeal option antiretroviral therapy HIV-infected patient consider solid organ transplantation . At present , however , little known safety long term tolerability RAL-containing regimens person undergo solid organ transplantation . As HIV-infected patient undergo organ transplantation , grow need good data thing effect dialysis RAL concentration , potential interaction commonly use immunosuppressive drug , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) characteristic end stage organ failure , well function graft . The propose study also examine transplant function survival HIV-infected patient receive RAL-containing ART compare HIV negative historic control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-transplant : - Patients stable antiretroviral regimen undergo evaluation transplantation subsequently place transplant wait list consider inclusion study . The detail cART patient remain sole purview patient patient 's HIV care provider . - To consider solid organ transplantation , addition routine transplant listing criterion , patient must fulfill follow criterion : 1. non-pregnant adult patient CD4 count &gt; 200/μL ; 2. concurrent active AIDS-defining infection malignancy ; 3. least 24 month well control HIV viremia , define &lt; 50 copy majority time . After screen procedure complete ensure eligibility , pre-transplant pharmacokinetic study do describe . Using specimen obtain 7 time point , patient-specific Cmax , Cmin AUC determination make use standard calculation approach . The PK data also include sample draw dialysis day patient End-stage renal failure : - pre-dialysis , arterial venous concentration ( Cin Cout ) begin dialysis , post dialysis level ( determine individual hemodialysis extraction ratio ) . Additional data collect include Quality Life questionnaire , SF-36 , PHQ-9 depression screen administer baseline test do enrollment . Patients ask dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan prior transplant ( unless complete within two year enrollment ) . Peri-transplant Assessments : In addition standard care laboratory imaging procedure do around time organ transplantation , follow research sample collect : - Pre-transplant - RAL concentration - In addition , follow information record subject 's medical record : full HIV infective history test result include CD4 count , percentage , HIV viral load , electrocardiography ( assess QTc interval ) , CMV-IgG/IgM , Hepatitis B , C , D screen +/- viral load already determine . Post-transplant inpatient hospitalization - RAL concentration well HIV viral load CD4/CD8 lymphocyte population . - In addition , follow information record subject 's medical record : test result include EKG ( assess QTc interval ) . Post-transplant : - RAL concentration collect Months 1 3 . - In addition routine post-transplant care , follow information collect subject 's medical record study month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 post transplant : CD4 count % , HIV viral load ( +/- genotype integrase mutation analysis viral rebound occur ) , Vitamin D , Basic Metabolic Panel ( calculate ClCr ) , quantitative urinary creatinine protein excretion . Patient side-effect card ascertain direct question study coordinator visit . Repeat DEXA scan do 24 month post-transplant visit . Quality Life assessment depression screening tool administer 6 24 month mark .</detailed_description>
