	<brief_summary>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation potentially curative treatment patient many hematologic malignancy ( e.g . leukemia , lymphoma , myeloma high risk relapse ) . This process require suitable donor . The best case scenario involve Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) match sibling donor . However , type donor always available . Donor registries provide another source match unrelated donor , may take valuable time delay treatment transplant recipient . Donor availability remain significant barrier use allogeneic ( donor ) stem cell transplant . This issue disproportionately affect patient minority background . Novel strategy improve outcomes use alternative donor desperately need . Haploidentical transplant alternative provide readily available donor form partially HLA match family member . This provide potential donor donor select base factor play role transplant success ( e.g . age , gender , KIR alloreactivity ) . Recent advance transplant technique greatly improved success rate haploidentical transplant although disease relapse remain issue . This trial aim provide alternative transplant option patient hematologic malignancy require bone marrow transplantation lack HLA identical donor . The investigational component study combination Fludarabine/ Busulfan/ Total Body Irradiation condition regimen HLA Haploidentical Transplant post-transplant Cyclophosphamide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation potentially curative treatment patient hematologic malignancy leukemia , lymphoma myeloma high risk relapse . As well potential deliver high dos chemotherapy radiation procedure affords benefit immunologic weapon disease form graft versus tumor effect . The major variable affect outcome allogeneic transplant include : patient selection ( age comorbidities ) ; disease status time transplantation ( remission vs. active disease ) ; type donor ( HLA match vs. mismatch relate vs. unrelated ) ; type conditioning regimen ; source stem cell ( bone marrow vs. peripheral blood ) . Recent advance field stem cell transplant substantially lower transplant related morbidity mortality . The availability stem cell transplant treatment modality dependent upon availability suitable donor . Best outcomes think occur HLA match sibling donor . The chance sibling HLA match approximately 25 % . Despite development large worldwide donor registry likelihood find HLA match unrelated donor 60-70 % best drop 10 % ethnic minority . In addition process identifying , confirm harvest unrelated donor cumbersome time consume time patient must proceed immediately transplant ( time initiation search identification unrelated donor identification take median 49 day ) . Therefore development alternative source hematopoietic stem cell area immense interest many investigator . Alternative source include cord blood HLA haploidentical donor . Cord blood attractive source permit immediate availability possibly low rate graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . However delay engraftment , particularly myeloablative conditioning , remain significant disadvantage . Haploidentical transplant carry advantage virtually patient immediate access suitable willing donor form partially HLA match family member . Furthermore number potential donor allow donor selection base upon factor age , gender , KIR alloreactivity . Finally donor readily available future cellular therapy donor lymphocyte infusion . Early attempt haploidentical transplantation hamper high rate graft failure severe graft versus host disease . Recent advance graft versus host disease prophylaxis post transplant high dose cyclophosphamide ( Cy ) overcome barrier large degree . Published study show HLA-haploidentical bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) non-myeloablative conditioning use 2 dos post-transplantation Cy follow tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) well-tolerated procedure . However , major cause treatment failure high-risk population early relapse . As condition intensity clearly link rate relapse multiple disease , postulate utilizing conditioning high anti-tumor potential lead lower relapse rate . Given advance GVHD prophylaxis post-transplantation Cy , reduce intensity conditioning Fludarabine , Busulfan total body irradiation combine high-dose post-transplantation Cy platform study . The toxicity reduce intensity condition regimen expect differ substantially previous data incorporate post-transplantation Cy . However , regimen may higher anti-tumor potential resulting decrease relapse rate .</detailed_description>
