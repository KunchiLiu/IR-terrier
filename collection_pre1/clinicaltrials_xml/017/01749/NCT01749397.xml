	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together floxuridine treat patient epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal cavity , fallopian tube cancer spread place body . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , floxuridine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving veliparib together floxuridine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose combination ABT-888 ( veliparib ) intraperitoneal ( IP ) floxuridine adult patient advanced ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe adverse event profile associate treatment combination . II . To assess preliminary evidence efficacy , tumor response , treatment combination . III . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cohort . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess pharmacokinetic profile ABT-888 floxuridine give combination . II . Assess whether presence mutation homologous recombination pathway loss expression non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) component correlate response floxuridine + ABT-888 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-10 floxuridine IP day 3-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
