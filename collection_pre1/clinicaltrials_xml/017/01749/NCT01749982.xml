	<brief_summary>Roughly 140 million people worldwide chronically expose As-contaminated drinking water concentration exceed World Health Organization ( WHO ) standard 10 Âµg/L . Arsenic class I carcinogen know cause several type cancer ischemic heart disease . Metabolism inorganic As ( InAs ) , facilitate urinary As excretion , rely one-carbon metabolism involve two methylation step ; utilize S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) methyl donor . SAM biosynthesis relies B vitamin include folate B12 recruitment transfer methyl group , nutrient , include choline betaine , also contribute methyl pool . Our recent finding cross-sectional study Bangladeshi adult expose wide range As concentration drink water show plasma choline betaine concentration positively associate As methylation . These finding suggest choline and/or betaine may play important role As methylation elimination simple intervention may therapeutic potential many population risk As-induced health effect . The investigator aim recruit follow 60 participant pilot study allow u 1 ) ass acceptance choline betaine supplement , 2 ) monitor participant potential side effect , 3 ) identify difficulty might encounter daily follow-up , 4 ) generate preliminary data regard effect choline and/or betaine supplementation arsenic methylation .</brief_summary>
