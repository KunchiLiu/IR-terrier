	<brief_summary>Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) HIV prevention strategy HIV medicine use person expose HIV order decrease chance get infect . In study , investigate new PrEP strategy woman use drug call maraviroc , medicine use treatment HIV infection call CCR5 antagonist . We hypothesize maraviroc could particularly good drug PrEP achieve high concentration genital tract woman decrease number HIV-susceptible cell genital tract , thus could potentially dose favorable way current PrEP drug . In order evaluate PrEP strategy , plan measure amount maraviroc blood genital tract HIV-negative healthy female volunteer , , give maraviroc dose either standard ( twice day ) reduce ( day ) dose 7 day compare woman give maraviroc . We also study immune cell blood genital tract woman see maravoric effect cell would prevent become infected HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring HIV Entry Blockade Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Strategy Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Globally , half HIV-infected adult woman , United States , 25 % HIV/AIDS case occur woman . Women often lack control many available prevention measure , underscore critical need enhance HIV prevention option woman . Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) HIV prevention strategy antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug use prior potential HIV exposure reduce likelihood infection . This strategy , usually contain drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , recently show promise , efficacy data suggest room improvement , particularly woman , data conflicting . This study aim prospectively examine ARV pharmacology mucosal immunology order evaluate novel PrEP strategy woman - blockade HIV entry target cell mucosal surface use CCR5 receptor antagonist maraviroc ( MVC ) . These action CCR5 receptor antagonism , validate , could lead reduce HIV acquisition risk favorable dose strategy available current PrEP . Knowledge pharmacological modulation mucosal immunity HIV acquisition risk fundamental understanding , improve , design new PrEP strategy . DESIGN This prospective , observational cohort study intensive pharmacokinetic component conduct HIV-negative healthy woman . Genital tract whole blood sample collect , , treatment 7 day oral MVC , dose 300mg twice daily ( standard ) 300mg daily ( reduce ) compare treatment ( control ) . Genital tract plasma MVC concentration measure use intensive pharmacokinetic sample generate concentration-time profile . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) endocervical cell harvest whole blood cervicovaginal lavage respectively analyze CCR5 receptor occupancy , number CCR5-expressing HIV target cell , level T cell activation . DURATION 21 day first visit last participant . Enrollment expect take 12 month . SAMPLE SIZE 30 subject ( 10 subject per study group ) POPULATION HIV-negative healthy woman , age 18 year old , normal menses .</detailed_description>
