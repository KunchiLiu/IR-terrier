	<brief_summary>The aim study compare effect transcranial direct current stimulation functional upper extremity task train functional upper extremity task train alone . The functional upper extremity task training use Armeo Spring robotic arm support limb play functional task game computer . Specific Aims : 1 . To demonstrate tDCS combine upper extremity functional task train virtual environment effective functional task train virtual environment sham tDCS . 2 . To compare cortico-excitatory change follow training tDCS vs. sham stimulation , use paired- single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation tool measure cortical excitability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded , sham-controlled study compare sham continuous tDCS combine repetitive upper extremity functional task train virtual environment . Subjects randomize 1 2 group : Armeo train continuous tDCS , sham tDCS randomization stratification approach . Subjects group stratum define degree weakness , randomize separately within stratum accord block randomization 6 receive Armeo training-continuous tDCS , Armeo training-sham stimulation . Each subject receive 10 training session 2 week . Training session last 40 minute focus repetitive task use Armeo device incorporate multidirectional reaching , grasp release action hand . We use variety virtual task ( computer game ) training . Examples virtual task include 1 ) pick object shelf place different wall room place bin center foreground screen , 2 ) pick eggs basket crack fry pan , 3 ) picking object virtual supermarket place shop cart , 4 ) cleaning stove top . In training session , subject encourage use affected arm daily activity . This assessed Motor Activity Log . tDCS deliver position anode primary motor cortex ( M1 ) affect hemisphere , cathode place unaffected M1 area . The electrode localization method accord International 10-20 Electrode Placement System placement EEG electrode . This method validate frameless stereotactic system . Direct current transfer saline-soaked pair surface sponge electrode ( 35cm2 ) deliver battery-driven , constant current stimulator maximum output 10mA . An intensity 1mA use study ( current density 0.04 Î¼A/cm2 ) . Continuous stimulation deliver intensity 1mA subject undergoes 40-minute Armeo motor training session . For sham stimulation , parameter employ . However , current apply 30 second . Current intensity gradually increase decreased diminish perception . Outcome measure perform prior treatment initiation , day 5 , 10 , follow-up week 1 , 2 4 end treatment . A rater blind treatment ass effect intervention use Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test Box Block Test .</detailed_description>
