	<criteria>All patient resectable CRLM without extrahepatic metastasis confirm tissue diagnosis radiologic exam undergo hepatic resection . All patient undergo hepatic arterial infusion pump placement without without hepatic resection . Patients may synchronous metachronous CRLM Patients may receive prior cytotoxic ( must least 2 week prior surgery ) antiangiogenic therapy ( must least 6 week prior surgery ) . Specific drug list . 5FU base chemotherapy 2 week Bevacizumab 6 week Cetuximab panitumumab 2 week Control patient include patient consented pancreaticoduodenectomy benign preneoplastic lesion . If lesion assume benign turn malignant final pathology , blood discard patient replace . Patients undergoing twostage hepatectomy resection , reevaluate second hepatectomy , consider reenrollment protocol Evidence extrahepatic disease preoperative image operative exploration , exclude primary colorectal tumor Those know bleed clot diatheses Patients diagnose chronic inflammatory disease lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , ulcerative colitis , Crohns disease , etc . Pre intraoperative evidence portal vein thrombosis hypertension Patients take immune modulate agent past 8 week include steroid , antiTNFÎ± , interferon etc . Patients take single dose Decadron part chemotherapy regimen exclude study . Patients take daily antiinflammatory medication COX2 inhibitor high dose NSAIDs . Patients take daily aspirin acetaminophen occasional antiinflammatory medication exclude study . If discretion operating surgeon , blood acquisition would lead undue morbidity , patient exclude replaced Attending physician authorize obtain informed consent may exercise discretion exclude individual appropriate medical reason .</criteria>
