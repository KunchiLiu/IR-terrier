	<detailed_description>Postlingual single-sided deafness ( SSD ) type hear impairment normal hear one ear severely impaired hearing ear . The condition induce multiple change neural plasticity central auditory pathway . One manifestation reflect increased common activation contralateral ipsilateral pathway stimulation normal hearing ear correlate increased activity contralateral ipsilateral hemisphere . As left right hemisphere specialize different auditory task , propose study aim demonstrate different consequence right left-sided deafness affect individual . Furthermore , question answer auditory deficit plastic change partially reverse cochlear implantation deaf ear . It assume change induce SSD detect reversal cochlear implant .</detailed_description>
