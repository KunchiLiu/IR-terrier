	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To determine maximum tolerate dose SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) lenalidomide dexamethasone ( LD ) patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . - Expansion Phase Only : To evaluate preliminary evidence antitumor activity ( objective response rate [ ORR ] ) SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) combination LD use International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate safety , include immunogenicity , SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) combination LD relapse refractory multiple myeloma . The severity , frequency incidence toxicity assess . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) administer combination LD PK lenalidomide combination SAR650984 dexamethasone . - To assess relationship clinical ( adverse event [ AE ] and/or tumor response ) effect pharmacologic parameter ( PK/pharmacodynamics ) , and/or biologic ( correlative laboratory ) result . - For dose expansion phase , estimate activity ( ORR ) use IMWG define response criterion SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) plus LD . - To describe progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat combination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration individual patient include screen period inclusion 21 day , least 4 week treatment absence severe adverse reaction , dose limit toxicity disease progression plus 60 day post-treatment follow . The treatment period may continue disease progression , intolerable toxicity , Investigator , sponsor , patient decision discontinue therapy . After study treatment discontinuation , end treatment ( EOT ) visit do 30 day assess safety , 30 60 day anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) PK . If ADA positive inconclusive day 60 , PK ADA repeat every 30 day ADA negative . Patients discontinue treatment reason progression disease follow monthly progression , initiation subsequent therapy , primary analysis cutoff date , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
