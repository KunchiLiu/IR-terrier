	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose tivantinib give together bevacizumab treat patient solid tumor spread area body remove surgery . Tivantinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Bevacizumab may also stop growth cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving tivantinib together bevacizumab may work well treat tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tivantinib Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab combination allosteric meet proto-oncogene ( MET ) inhibitor , tivantinib , patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) toxicity associate bevacizumab combination tivantinib assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4.0 . II . Document anti-tumor activity bevacizumab combination tivantinib patient advance solid tumor . III . Determine pharmacokinetics tivantinib administer combination bevacizumab patient advance solid tumor . IV . Perform cytochrome P450 family 2 , subfamily C , polypeptide 19 ( CYP2C19 ) genotyping subject correlate pharmacokinetics toxicity . V. Assess effect bevacizumab plus tivantinib plasma component hepatocellular growth factor ( HGF ) -MET signal pathway ( HGF , HGF activator [ HGFA ] ) VEGF signal pathway ( VEGF A , B , C , D placental growth factor [ PIGF ] ) . VI . Assess tissue ( tumor skin ) protein biomarkers study treatment include MET , phospho-MET^tyrosine ( Tyr ) 1349 phosphor-focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) ^Tyr861 . VII . Assess early therapy response quantitative biomarker image fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( F-18 FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic image resonance ( MRI ) small sample ( n 15 ) subject willing participate imaging assessment UPCI 12-096 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study tivantinib . Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day -15 , 1 , 15 ( day -15 course 1 ) tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
