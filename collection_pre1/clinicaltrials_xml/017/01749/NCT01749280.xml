	<brief_summary>The aorta main blood vessel come heart distribute blood whole body . In people , aorta becomes swell ( aneurysm ) burst , especially pass abdomen . These 'abdominal aortic aneurysm ' often occur without symptom burst rupture without warn . This usually lead death represent thirteenth commonest cause death United Kingdom . In study , look new technique look aortic aneurysm use magnetic resonance imaging ; technique require x-rays radiation . We recently show , use magnetic resonance combine new image agent USPIO , detect 'hotspots ' activity aneurysm seem predict aneurysm grow rapidly , therefore potentially risk rupture . We propose conduct study Edinburgh invite patient surveillance aneurysm . We image patient use novel technique see identify patient burst aneurysm , aneurysm grows large need surgery , die . This important establish potentially lead new way manage people could ultimately save life . This particularly timely national screening surveillance programme currently launch .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS We hypothesise uptake ultrasmall supraparamagnetic particle iron oxide aortic wall predict abdominal aortic aneurysm growth clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
