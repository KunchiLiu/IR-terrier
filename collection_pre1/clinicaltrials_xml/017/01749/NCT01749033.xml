	<brief_summary>A laryngeal mask airway ( `` LMA '' ) airway device commonly use place general anesthesia facilitate ventilation patient 's lung anesthetize . It similar `` endotracheal tube '' ( breathe tube ) less invasive . It also place backup Anesthesiologist unable pas breathe tube patient adequately ventilate . Unfortunately , LMA may lead complication similar breathe tube placement , sore throat hoarse voice . Previous study examine several variable may affect often complication occur ; variable include give anti-inflammatory medication inflate LMA different pressure ( `` work '' end LMA , rest patient 's throat , cuff inflate provide seal ) . We study effect PLACEMENT TECHNIQUE postoperative sore throat , hoarse voice , difficulty swallow . We use 3 placement technique - traditional placement technique , slightly different traditional placement technique , new technique , abbreviate `` ELLIA '' method . The hypothesis study new LMA insertion technique difference postoperative pharyngolaryngeal morbidity include sore throat , dysphagia dysphonia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Insertion Technique Laryngeal Mask Airway</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LMA insert base one three method randomly assign patient . The ELLIA technique involve gently lifting patient 's laryngeal structure ( throat ) place LMA oppose force gravity . Whereas traditional method placement involve guide LMA pharynx finger insert pharynx , ELLIA method avoids step . General anesthesia maintain discretion Anesthesiologist throughout surgical procedure . At end case , would normally occur , LMA remove patient 's airway patient take PACU , care usual . At one two hour postoperatively , blind research assistant assess patient sore throat , hoarse voice , difficulty swallowing . Finally , 24 hour patient receive telephone call blind research assistant assess outcome . These data collect present .</detailed_description>
