	<brief_title>Kinematic Kinetic Effects Orthotic Devices Subjects With Stage II Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthotic device serve essential element conservative care program posterior tibial tendon dysfunction ( PTTD ) . Data currently use device remain limited . Current device design restrictive focus correction flatfoot kinematics subject stage II PTTD . Restrictive design limit ankle motion may lead weakness alter gait dynamic . It remain unclear less restrictive device design would optimal subject stage II PTTD . The aims current proposal examine in-vivo biomechanics different device design use outcome identify device design optimal subject stage II PTTD . Research Design : This study use laboratory base repeated measure design explore function four different orthotic device sample 60 subject stage II PTTD baseline . Then subject follow prospectively 12 week wear one orthotic device . Clinical outcome include strength , tendon morphology , self-reported outcome measure 12 week . Baseline foot kinematics collect use three segment foot model ( first metatarsal , calcaneus , tibia ) data ankle kinetics derive kinematic data ground reaction force . Impact : There currently head-to-head comparison available among various device use conservative management stage II PTTD . The propose study provide necessary control data determine kinematic kinetic effect select device specific component need optimize device design . Outcomes use determine design successful use clinically .</detailed_description>
