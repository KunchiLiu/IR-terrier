	<brief_title>Electronic Cigarettes Reactivity Smoking Cues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco-related illness cause 5 million death per year develop world , currently available smoke cessation treatment effectively enhance long-term cessation outcome . Reactivity smoke cue one factor associate relapse vulnerability , untreated cessation aid NRT . Combining treatment , ameliorate pharmacological nicotine withdrawal reduce smoke cue reactivity , may enhance smoke cessation success . During study test whether combine NRT non-nicotine contain electronic cigarette ( e-cigarettes ) effectively reduce reactivity smoking cue . The source nicotine participant receive study come NRT . We use e-cigarettes provide nicotine , yet may provide similar experience smoking e-cigarettes taste feel similar regular cigarette .
