	<brief_summary>The treatment germ cell tumour consider one major success area cytotoxic chemotherapy . Even patient relapse first line therapy , durable remission rate 25 % 60 % see use chemotherapy . In 1999 , researcher St Bartholomew 's Hospital develop GAMEC protocol ( combination chemotherapy filgrastim , actinomycin D , methotrexate , etoposide , cisplatin ) . Results study show 50 % patient relapse testicular cancer could cure use treatment . When review individual patient clear old patient ( &gt; 35yrs ) patient raise Lactate Dehydrogenase ( blood test monitor cancer activity ) , well . In addition , patient whose original tumour start chest ( mediastinal germ cell tumour ) tend badly relapse . We develop study patient fulfil least one criterion . The GAMIO study ( filgrastim , actinomycin D , methotrexate , irinotecan , oxaliplatin ) recently close due problem high level toxicity irinotecan . GAMMA new study use paclitaxel instead irinotecan oxaliplatin instead cisplatin . We expect treatment oxaliplatin less damaging kidney cisplatin . Both oxaliplatin paclitaxel oxaliplatin irinotecan similar activity relapse patient phase II set . We hope improve previous result substitution see lead improvement cure rate relapse germ cell tumours poor prognosis reduce side effect compare standard treatment . In addition , expect hear damage treatment require short hospital stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Single Arm Phase II Study Relapsed Germ Cell Tumours With Poor Prognosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive 4 drug combination chemotherapy hospital two night . On third day , patient receive injection pegfilgrastim . This stimulate bone marrow produce white blood cell shorten period risk serious infection . The treatment repeat every three week . This constitute one cycle treatment . We aim give patient four cycle treatment total twelve week . Before cycle , follow conduct - physical examination , full blood count , urea + electrolyte , liver function test , LDH , αFP , βHCG . Patients FDG PET-CT scan baseline , prior cycle 2 ( approximately 1521 day chemotherapy start ) within 28 day last treatment , clinically indicate . On cycle , serum creatinine measure 24 hour start methotrexate exclude renal failure due methotrexate . The follow conducted end treatment physical examination , full blood count , urea + electrolyte , liver function test , LDH , αFP , βHCG . The patient monitor chemotherapy monthly first year two monthly second year . An interim analysis perform 15 patient complete treatment . If less 9 response observe group , study terminate . The final analysis perform 43 patient recruit , complete treatment follow 24 month .</detailed_description>
