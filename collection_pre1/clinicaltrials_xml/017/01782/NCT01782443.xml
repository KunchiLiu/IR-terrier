	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug , Ziv-aflibercept , study . It also mean FDA yet approve Ziv-aflibercept use patient type cancer . Every person molecule bloodstream call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFs ) . These molecule help grow sustain new blood vessel need human body . Cancer tumor hijack mechanism need new blod vessel oxygen grow . Ziv-aflibercept antibody . Antibodies proteins produce naturally body help recognize foreign substance body . Ziv-aflibercept `` targeted therapy '' call `` VEGF Trap '' , `` trap '' ( bind ) VEGFs prevents cancer use grow . Though Ziv-aflibercept yet FDA approve treatment carcinoid tumor , recently approve patient treatment-resistant colorectal cancer . In research study , use Ziv-aflibercept combination standard octreotide therapy see slow growth spread carcinoid tumor . Standard octreotide ( sandostatin ) therapy currently approve treat symptom carcinoid tumor , cause carcinoid syndrome . Carcinoid syndrome cause hormone substance release carcinoid tumor bloodstream . One secrete substance serotonin , one body 's natural chemical messenger . When excess serotonin secrete carcinoid tumor reach body 's tissue , think cause diarrhea redness ( flush ) face , chest back . Excess serotonin may also cause change structure heart valve , impair heart 's function . Octreotide work bind receptor find carcinoid tumor prevents release hormone tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If willing participate study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , physical examination , CT MRI , blood test , serum chromogranin A , urine test , 24-hour urine collection , pregnancy test electrocardiogram . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . If meet requirement study agree continue participation , receive Ziv-aflibercept every two week . Each dose Ziv-aflibercept consist approximately 60 minute infusion ( needle vein ) . You also receive injection Octreotide LAR ( long act release ) monthly part treatment carcinoid tumor . This injection give nurse buttock . You may already Octreotide LAR . In case , continue take dose schedule . You need come clinic every two week participate study . Each cycle 28 day . The following test procedure perform Days 1 15 cycle : question health , physical exam ( Day 1 cycle ) , vital sign , blood test , pregnancy test ( Day 1 cycle ) . Urine test perform every cycle . The following test procedures do end every third cycle : CT scan MRI , Serum Chromogranin A , 24-hour urine collection . After final dose study drug follow test procedure perform : question general health , physical exam , vital sign , blood test , pregnancy test , EKG , Serum Chromogranin A , 24-hour urine collection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm well differentiate moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumor either primary metastatic site Must disease amenable curative resection Must evidence disease progression within 12 month prior study entry Must measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) Prior chemoembolization local ablative therapy allow , provide measurable disease outside area treat , document evidence progression site prior treatment No limit number prior treatment . Prior bevacizumab allow unless discontinue due unacceptable toxicity . Prior TKI target VEGF receptor allow Treatment somatostatin analog require subject Subjects history hypertension must adequately control Therapeutic anticoagulation allow . Must stable dose anticoagulant medication Must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry , duration study participation 3 month last administration study drug Prior treatment include chemoembolization within 4 week study entry Major surgery within 4 week study entry minor surgery within 2 week study entry Pregnant breastfeed Poorly differentiate carcinoma , high grade neuroendocrine tumor small cell carcinoma Prior treatment Zivaflibercept Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( islet cell carcinoma ) exclude study . All non functional functional islet cell carcinoma insulinoma , glucagonoma , gastrinoma , VIPoma exclude . Not adequately recover toxicity previous therapy Known untreated brain central nervous system metastasis Known allergy study agent compound similar chemical biologic composition History congestive heart failure Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease Unhealed wound , ulcer bone fracture HIV positive active Hepatitis infection History abdominal fistula , GI perforation , intra abdominal abscess , uncontrolled GI bleeding , diverticulitis within 6 month study entry History arterial thrombotic event myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris ischemic hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident within past 6 month No history pulmonary embolism , DVT vascular access relate thrombosis also receive adequate anticoagulation stable dose . No history prior synchronous malignancy except treated curative intent least 3 year prior study entry , adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , prostate intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence prostate cancer Uncontrolled nonmalignant illness may increase risk associate study participation may interfere conduct study interpretation study result Uncontrolled psychiatric illness social situation would limit compliance study requirement</criteria>
