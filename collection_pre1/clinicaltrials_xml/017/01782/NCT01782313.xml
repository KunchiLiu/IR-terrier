	<brief_summary>This study patient diagnose soft tissue sarcoma spread ( metastasize ) eligible removal surgery . The purpose study determine soft tissue sarcomas respond treatment investigational drug call tivozanib . In lab clinical study , tivozanib show interfere growth type tumor . The study also evaluate safe study treatment observe many kind adverse event ( side effect ) participant experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Tivozanib Patients With Metastatic Non-resectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival ( define complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) assess 16 week patient treat tivozanib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall response rate ( define CR + PR ) . II . Clinical benefit rate ( CR + PR + SD ) . III . Overall survival ( 2 year beyond progression ) . IV . Correlation clinical outcome antibody vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 ( VEGFR1 ) VEGFR2 . V. Assess Safety tolerability . OUTLINE : Patients receive tivozanib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , discontinuation per patient preference physician recommendation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
