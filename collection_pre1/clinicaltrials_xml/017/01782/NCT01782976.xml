	<brief_title>Ph II Cilengitide Plus Bevacizumab Recurrent Glioblastoma ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 4 week . The length study cycle may extend experience side effect drug . Cilengitide give intravenous ( IV ) infusion ( vein ) 2 time week 4-week cycle . The infusion last 1 hour time separate least 72 hour . Bevacizumab give IV infusion 90 minute Days 1 15 cycle . After several infusion depend react , length time infusion may decrease . If study doctor think best interest depend react bevacizumab , length infusion time may decrease . On day schedule receive cilengitide bevacizumab , receive cilengitide bevacizumab infusion . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , urine blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , blood pressure measure blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You complete MDASI-BT questionnaire . - Urine blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , . ) On Day 15 Cycles 2 beyond , blood pressure measure . End-of-Treatment Visit : After last dose study drug , end-of-treatment visit follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam include measurement weight vitals . - Your performance status record . - You neurologic exam . - Your performance status record . - You complete MDASI-BT questionnaire . - Urine blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study long-term follow-up phone call . Long-Term Follow-Up Visit : After stop take study drug complete end-of-treatment visit , study staff call 1 time every 6 month check . Each phone call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment recurrent glioblastoma . Cilengitide FDA approve commercially available . At time , combination cilengitide bevacizumab use research purpose . Up 39 participant take part multicenter study . Up 20 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically prove intracranial glioblastoma ( GBM ) eligible protocol . Patients eligible original histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis glioblastoma make . ) Central pathology review require study entry . Either H &amp; E stain slide diagnosis recent tumor sampling OR unstained tumor section must submit review study neuropathologist . b ) A paraffinembedded tumor block ( prefer ) 15 unstained tumor section slide require submitted time registration . 2 . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must sign authorization release protect health information . Patients must register MD Anderson Cancer Center Office Multicenter Clinical Research ( OMCR ) database prior treatment study drug . 3 . Patients must &gt; /= 18 year old . 4 . Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; /= 70 5 . At time registration : Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy : &gt; /= 28 day investigational agent , &gt; /= 28 day prior cytotoxic therapy ( &gt; /= 7 day prior daily administer [ i.e . metronomic ] cytotoxic agent ) , &gt; /= 14 day vincristine , &gt; /= 42 day nitrosoureas , &gt; /= 21 day procarbazine administration , &gt; /= 7 day noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct Study Chair . 6 . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( ANC &gt; /= 1,000/mm3 , platelet count &gt; /= 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; /= 10 gm/dl ) , adequate liver function ( SGOT &lt; 2.5 time ULN bilirubin &lt; 2 time ULN ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN ) start therapy . These test must perform within 14 day prior treatment start date . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . 7 . Patients must show unequivocal radiographic evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . A scan performed within 14 day prior treatment start date steroid dose stable decrease least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date image registration new baseline MR/CT require . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . 8 . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : ) . They recover effect surgery least four week craniotomy least 1 week stereotactic biopsy . b ) . Residual disease follow resection recurrent GBM mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , CT/ MRI do later 96 hour immediate postoperative period least 4 week postoperatively , within 14 day prior treatment start date . If 96hour scan 14 day registration , scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI/CT require stable steroid dosage least 5 day . 9 . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 12 week completion radiation therapy study entry unless new area enhancement consistent recurrent tumor outside radiation field , histopathologic confirmation recurrent tumor . 10 .
