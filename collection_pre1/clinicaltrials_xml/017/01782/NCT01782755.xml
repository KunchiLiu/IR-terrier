	<brief_summary>Probiotics commercially available live bacteria think health benefit ingest . A literature review probiotic study intensive care unit ( ICU ) find patient receive probiotic , 25 % reduction lung infection , know ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . There also 18 % reduction chance develop infection ICU . However , study review small well do . Therefore , whether probiotic really helpful unclear . Before large carefully perform study do evaluate effect probiotic critically ill patient , pilot trial need . The investigator plan study feasibility trial mechanically ventilate ICU patient 11 ICUs Ontario , investigate whether orally ingest L. rhamnosus GG ( common probiotic ) prevent VAP infection . The 4 goal pilot study ensure successfully enrol patient ; follow protocol faithfully ; make sure patient n't receive additional probiotic , estimate much pneumonia exist patient . In separate substudy , investigator evaluate effect probiotic low lung infiltration potential harmful bacteria , stool bacteria , marker immunity call cytokine , marker infection call endotoxin level . The investigator plan enroll 150 adult admit ICU receive mechanical ventilation . Following informed consent , patient randomize either L. rhamnosus GG group identical placebo . Twice daily , patient receive probiotic placebo feed tube . The investigator record infection important outcome ICU . This study important ongoing search effective strategy prevent serious infection critical illness . Probiotics may easy-to-use , readily available , inexpensive approach help future critically ill patient around world .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotics : Prevention Severe Pneumonia Endotracheal Colonization Trial ( PROSPECT ) : A Feasibility Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Probiotics define live microorganism may confer health benefit ingest . Meta-analysis probiotic trial suggest 25 % low ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) 18 % low infection rate overall administered patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) . However , prior trial small , largely single center , high risk bias . Before large rigorous trial launch , test whether probiotic confer benefit , harm , impact , pilot trial need . The aim PROSPECT Pilot Trial determine feasibility perform large trial mechanically ventilate critically ill patient investigate Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG . A priori , determine feasibility large trial would base timely recruitment , high protocol adherence , minimal contamination , acceptable VAP rate . Methods/design : Patients ≥18 year old ICU anticipate receive mechanical ventilation ≥72 hour include . Patients exclude increase risk probiotic-associated infection , strict enteral medication contraindication , pregnant , previously enrol related trial , receive palliative care . Following informed consent , patient randomize variable unspecified block size fix 1:1 ratio , stratify ICU , medical , surgical , trauma admit diagnosis . Patients receive 1 × 1010 colony form unit L. rhamnosus GG ( Culturelle , Locin Industries Ltd ) identical placebo suspend tap water administer twice daily via nasogastric tube ICU . Clinical research staff , patient , family blind . Discussion : The primary outcome pilot trial following : ( 1 ) recruitment success , ( 2 ) ≥90 % protocol adherence , ( 3 ) ≤5 % contamination , ( 4 ) ~10 % VAP rate . Additional clinical outcome VAP , infection , diarrhea ( total , antibiotic associate , Clostridium difficile ) , ICU hospital length stay , mortality . The morbidity , mortality , cost VAP underscore need cost-effective prophylactic intervention . The PROSPECT Pilot Trial initial step toward rigorously evaluate whether probiotic decrease nosocomial infection , effect , actually cause infection critically ill patient .
