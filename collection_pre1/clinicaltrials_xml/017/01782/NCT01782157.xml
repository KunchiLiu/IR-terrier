	<brief_summary>The world 's population age result prevalence chronic illness challenge society must address . The vision address challenge design smart environment technology keep old adult function independently home long possible . Smart environment use basis monitoring activity resident health condition . However , currently lack large scale , longitudinal research identify early marker dementia health status change predict functional decline . The objective project perform 5-year longitudinal study old adult perform daily activity smart home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>By track resident ' daily behavior long period time intelligent software perform automate functional assessment identify trend indicator acute health change slower progressive decline ( e.g. , dementia ) . By implement prompt-based intervention support functional independence promote healthy lifestyle behavior ( e.g. , social contact , exercise , regular sleep ) , investigator improve overall health well-being . The investigator hypothesize smart home technology use detect predict functional change , slow functional change extend functional independence , improve quality life elderly individual risk transition mild cognitive impairment dementia . This hypothesis formulate basis preliminary data produce applicant support efficacy use smart home technology functional status assessment prompt initiation completion activity individual mild cognitive impairment dementia . The rationale propose work understand natural history functional change age dementia lead early prevention proactive intervention slow functional change , thereby delay nursing home placement cost care society . The investigator plan pursue follow specific aim : ( 1 ) Characterize daily lifestyle smart environment resident minimal-supervision activity recognition activity discovery , ( 2 ) Design software algorithm detect trend behavioral data , ( 3 ) Evaluate efficacy activity-aware automate prompt technology extend functional independence improve quality life . The propose work innovative track large number individual longitudinal home determine whether technology use promote healthy lifestyle behavior detect health care change may lead early intervention , improve quality life , decrease health care utilization . The project significant introduce new technology activity discovery track require minimal-supervision , contribute algorithm predict cognitive decline signal acute health status change , demonstrate first time activity-aware automate prompt technology use support and/or slow functional change increase quality life elderly individual .</detailed_description>
