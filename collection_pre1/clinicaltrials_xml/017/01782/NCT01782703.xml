	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , also know eczema , common inflammatory skin disorder child , affect 10-20 % child 1-2 % adult . This skin disorder associate unbearable itchiness increase susceptibility skin infection . The cause AD currently poorly understood ; therefore , target treatment option present . There recent study adults AD explain cause give u new route investigate treatment option , however major study arena do child . We hope evaluate skin blood biomarkers find pediatric AD compare adult AD . Hypothesis : The immune system worsen skin barrier issue common atopic dermatitis . We believe similar immune skin abnormality adult versus pediatric atopic dermatitis . Finally , blood level activate molecule atopic dermatitis serve surrogate skin immune activation correlate disease severity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To define cellular molecular biomarkers atopic dermatitis skin biopsy blood sample pre-adolescent pediatric population correlate disease severity . 2 . To measure skin barrier atopic dermatitis . 3 . To determine quality life atopic dermatitis various questionnaire .</detailed_description>
