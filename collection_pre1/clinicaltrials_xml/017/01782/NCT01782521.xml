	<detailed_description>AIMS OF THE TRIAL The primary aim trial find clinically acceptable bracket failure rate achieve metal bracket ( fix brace attachment ) glue ( bond ) teeth without use primer compare bracket glue conventional primer adolescent adult orthodontic patient 12 month study period . The objective determine glue time per bracket different group type glue failure bracket-tooth interface use Adhesive Remnant Index . Length treatment time Peer Assessment Rating score also analyse . HYPOTHESES The null hypothesis primary outcome - `` difference bracket failure rate metal bracket bond primer compare bond without primer '' . The null hypothesis secondary outcome - `` difference bonding time per bracket type bond failure use Adhesive Remnant Index control experimental group study . METHOD OF INVESTIGATION 1 . Sample population All patient refer Leeds Dental Institute/Seacroft hospital/ St.Luke 's hospital , Bradford qualify orthodontic treatment . 2 . Setting Patients treat dental teaching hospital district NHS hospital set 3 . Operator characteristic All patient treat start end study period 6 operator various experience ( NHS specialist registrar two site − Leeds Dental Institute St.Luke 's Hospital , orthodontic therapist ( SLH ) consultant orthodontist ( SLH/LDI Seacroft hospital ) 4 . Study design A multicentre single-blinded randomise controlled clinical trial NHS hospital setting . Individual patient allocate randomly either test control group . 5 . Intervention Test group − Metal bracket bond without primer Control group − Metal bracket bond primer 6 . Methods minimise bias - Randomisation Blinding All consecutive patient need fix appliance treatment take wait list attempt make match age , sex malocclusion ensure representative sample , except exclusion criterion . After informed consent obtain , randomly allocate either control ( primer ) experimental ( without primer ) group . This do preparing opaque number sealed envelope block 10 advance supervisor ( NH ) use random number table . The supervisor enroll participant assign group use seal envelope blind two operator participant assignment enrollment . Once envelope open blind operator lose . The operator blind trial intervention administer test group blind . Treatment start patient within 3 month enrollment . 7 . Agreed start end point Upper low teeth bond appropriate . If upper low teeth bond separate visit , specific date consider start point . The follow period 12 month incidence first bracket loss record ( i.e . event ) . Any subsequent bracket loss also record . For patient failure bracket survival time follow end fix appliance treatment original subsequent operator ( i.e . anybody involved follow−up patient end 12 month study period ) . In event repeat failure patient area , data record statistical analysis cluster appropriately select . 8 . Subject withdrawal criterion Any participant voluntarily withdraw study time without compromise agree propose treatment . Such subject account data statistical analysis . The drop-out sample replace trial . All data pertain first time bracket failure record agree withdrawal date individual sample . The follow patient orthodontic treatment data pertain trial record sample confirms withdrawal . 9 . Trial termination - reason abandon trial The trial terminate 50 % bracket fail ( great 8 bracket per patient ) experimental group least three patient within first review appointment ( 6 week ) . This high failure rate clinically unacceptable continuation routine orthodontic treatment experimental group . 10 . Bracket Bonding procedure As bracket failure rate control group calculate previous study Littlewood et al. , similar procedure bond bracket follow study avoid intervention bias . All teeth bond include molar teeth . A pre−calibrated light cure unit use set glue hard follow - CONTROL GROUP 1 . 30 second wash 30 second dry use 3 1 syringe 2 . 30 second treatment 37 % phosphoric acid gel 3 . 30 second wash 30 second dry use 3 1 syringe 4 .

Metal bracket place long axis point outer surface tooth 5 . Light polymerisation ; 30 second either side tooth 11 . Type data collect The following data collect : 1 . Bracket lose first time subsequent failure respective tooth notation 2 . Date bracket failure* 3 . Tooth number 4 . Whether primer use 5 . Operator involve 6 . Time take first step bond procedure last bracket place arch 7 . Adhesive Remnant Index debonding interface 8 . Patient identification number 9 . Length treatment 10 . Peer Assessment Rating score ( PAR ) *If patient attends appointment bracket failure actual failure date accurately recall patient , date first attendance bracket failure note . 12 . Outcomes ( primary secondary ) 1 . Primary outcome - Bracket failure rate test control group 2 . Secondary outcome - Bonding time per bracket , Type bond failure ( use Adhesive Remnant Index ) , length treatment PAR score . Summary main issue - 1 . PURPOSE AND DESIGN Routinely orthodontic treatment carry place orthodontic bracket teeth wire run help move teeth . These metal bracket bond glue onto tooth surface three step process . Firstly , mild acid use roughen tooth surface , secondly free flow glue ( composite primer ) use fill roughen pore thirdly , bracket glue tooth surface 'composite ' material set hard exposure high intensity light . In routine study , success procedure measure bracket failure rate . The literature review reveal 7 study relevant bond orthodontic bracket without use primer . Out 5 invitro experimental study , 1 retrospective study 1 prospective non−randomised control study . Most study field lab base study measure bond strength failure rate extract human teeth . The methodology use retrospective lack robust study design eliminate bias . This literature review suggest scientific evidence clear indicate whether use primer absolutely essential achieve acceptable bracket success/failure rate clinical environment . A RCT design carry Bradford/Leeds ( see previous reference number ) show statistical difference primer non primer group . However , single operator study orthodontic trainee . This study aim 'real world ' effect use multiple operator various degree orthodontic experience . To summarise , arguably evidence available previous study either support refute use primer prior bond bracket clinical set appear weak . The main drawback study relate inconsistent study design many conclusion may applicable follow reason -invitro study , use chemically cure resins rather light cure system currently use , different bracket system , variation bond step , use flowable composite routinely use bond lack prospective randomize control study clinical setting . All study conclude need research investigate clinically acceptable bond strength achieve without use primer . If hypothesis true , bond bracket may become faster , efficient cost effective . Therefore , well design randomize control study could justify clarify use primer essential prior bond bracket . The result randomise clinical trial help improve knowledge best approach bond metal bracket teeth . If bracket failure rate similar group , suggest use primer always necessary gain sufficient bond strength clinical environment . From patient 's perspective , would mean less clinical time required place bracket start orthodontic treatment . For clinician NHS purchaser outcome study influence clinical chair side time , cost effectiveness ( primer expensive component bond process ) provide framework future study field . The trainee student benefit train broad research methodology , scientific critique , statistical concept experience undertaking randomise clinical trial part Masters project . PROTOCOL/ QUALITY ASSURANCE The research undertaken part routine orthodontic care provide consultant lead service orthodontic department Leeds Dental Hospital , St Lukes Hospital Seacroft hospital . All patient recruit project receive standard quality orthodontic treatment provide choose partake study . All procedure orthodontic treatment Leeds Dental Institute/Bradford teach hospital quality assure Deanery/General Dental Council Specialist Advisory Committee ( SAC ) part establish three year train programme Orthodontics ( relate fact one researcher orthodontic registrar train pathway ) . The clinician orthodontic consultant orthodontic therapist supervise orthodontic therapist . The research committee Leeds Dental Institute consist Clinical/Academic Orthodontic Consultants region routinely involved supervision MSc/DDS student regard research project every year . This panel ask review protocol prior submission member include independent reviewer involve study . RECRUITMENT All consecutive patient need fix appliance therapy take NHS wait list attempt make match age , sex malocclusion ensure representative sample , except exclusion criterion . After informed consent obtain , randomly allocate either control ( Transbond primer ) experimental ( without primer ) group . This do pre par opaque number sealed envelope block 10 advance supervisor ( NH ) use random number table . The supervisor enroll participant assign group use seal envelope blind two operator participant assignment enrollment . Once envelope open blind operator lose . The operator blind trial intervention administer test group blind . Treatment start patient within 3 month enrollment . INCLUSION / EXCLUSION Inclusion criterion •Patients require single two arch fix appliance therapy ( history previous orthodontic treatment ) include patient require orthognathic surgery •Willing consent participate trial Exclusion criterion - Patients craniofacial anomaly - Patients several buccal restoration congenital enamel defect - Hypodontia case ( one tooth miss quadrant ) CONSENT Children 16 Routine orthodontic treatment undertaken 12 year age onwards majority patient require orthodontic treatment age group NHS wait list . These patient include study clinical relevance study applicable patient age group , addition adult . Appropriate inform consent parental involvement routinely follow start treatment patient per NHS trust policy . Each participant give patient information sheet outline objective , detail study answer frequently ask question . The patient information sheet draft individually adults child 16 year age . The informed consent process do registrar treat case supervise consultant , usually next appointment enough time give patient choose participate . All participant explain regard research prior consent . For participant 16 year age , informed consent process involve responsible parent sign form addition child . A minimum 24 hour upto 6 week ( next appointment ) time usually available patient think decision participate . In routine orthodontic treatment , usually registrar/clinician take treatment record initial visit give patient information leaflet . Routinely treatment planning consent do subsequent appointment usually week consultant supervision . Any participant requiring language interpretation provide suitably qualified interpreter , per NHS trust protocol . No participant exclude basis ethnic origin , language preference , religion , sexual preference gender . Any involvement patient significant learning disability special need raise sensitive issue relate comprehension consent . Although excluded participation wish , patient offer partake view person parental authority consider . RISKS , BURDEN AND BENEFITS Possibly , great failure bracket ( fix brace attachment ) experimental group may need glue back soon . These failure affect treatment outcome way . Possibly , extra visit department bracket fail , glue back . This may add week additional time overall treatment , affect treatment outcome way . As per draft protocol trial `` trial terminate 50 % bracket fail experimental group least three patient within first review appointment ( 6 week ) . This high failure rate clinically unacceptable continuation routine orthodontic treatment experimental group `` In situation participant inform write regard trial termination step would take ensure routine orthodontic treatment continue plan . In case bracket bond per protocol experimental group replace match control group i.e . routine treatment .
