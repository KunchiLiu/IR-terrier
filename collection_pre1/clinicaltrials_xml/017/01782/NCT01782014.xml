	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine method colonoscopy viz . water insufflation air insufflation carbon dioxide insufflation well detect adenoma colon also methods best tolerated patient . Hypothesis : investigator hypothesize patient undergo first time screen colonoscopy high Adenoma Detection Rate find proximal colon group randomize water method compare randomize air CO2 insufflation method</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Significance : ADR independent predictor risk post screen colonoscopy colon cancer . A simple method solely control colonoscopist enhances proximal ADR hold promise rectify unresolved shortcoming screen colonoscopy fail reduce occurrence post screen incident cancer proximal colon associate cancer mortality . Hypotheses &amp; Specific Aims : Primary Hypothesis : In patient undergo first time screen high ADR find proximal colon randomize water method compare randomize air method CO2 method . Secondary Hypotheses : The examination method co-variables , procedure-related patient-centered outcome , independent predictor proximal colon ADR . Specific Aims : This prospective , randomize , single-blinded control study compare study ( water ) control 1 ( air ) method control 2 ( CO2 method ) aid insertion colonoscope . The proximal colon ADR , total ADR , co-variables , procedure-related patient-centered outcome adverse event within 30 day colonoscopy record compare study control method .</detailed_description>
