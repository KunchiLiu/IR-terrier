	<brief_title>Mendelian Reverse Cholesterol Transport Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study use 3H-cholesterol bound albumin ( particulate cholesterol ) ass ability HDL transport cholesterol periphery liver eliminate . This process call reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) one main mechanism HDL protect atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . Mutations gene affect HDL metabolism , may result change RCT . The validation method assess RCT important development new drug affect RCT may result useful treatment atherosclerosis . Subjects carry mutation gene know affect HDL metabolism healthy control enrol study . Changes tracer activity total plasma , lipoproteins fraction feces analyze follow intravenous administration radiolabeled particulate cholesterol .</detailed_description>
