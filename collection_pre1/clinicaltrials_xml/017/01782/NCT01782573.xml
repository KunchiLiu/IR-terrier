	<brief_title>The Efficacy Chlorhexidine Gluconate Pre - Disinfection Scrubbing Preventing Surgical Site Infections Hepatectomy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSIs ) follow elective surgical procedure occur commonly result colonization patient 's native skin flora . The common pathogen cause SSIs Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-negative Staphylococci , component normal skin flora . Therefore , preoperative disinfection surgical site antiseptic skin preparation standard practice surgical intervention decrease skin microbial count incision . It consider important step limit surgical wound contamination prevent infection . A variety skin-preparation agent method available prevent surgical site infection technique preoperative cleanse skin vary among hospital surgeon . There press need elucidate effect cutaneous disinfection chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) prevention surgical site infection . Many study demonstrate comparison cutaneous disinfection povidone-iodine , disinfection CHG insertion intravascular device post-infection site care substantially reduce incidence device-related infection . Hence , study aim test whether additional chlorhexidine gluconate scrub follow routine disinfection would lower incidence surgical site culture subsequent infection hepatic resection . This data show originality clinical importance cutaneous pre-disinfection scrub solution risk patient hepatectomy .</detailed_description>
