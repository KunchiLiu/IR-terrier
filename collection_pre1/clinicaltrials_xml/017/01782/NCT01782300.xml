	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Two Doses Dengue Virus Vaccine Administered 12 Months Apart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue virus major health concern , particularly tropical subtropical region world . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) make development dengue vaccine top priority . There four type dengue virus ( DEN1 , DEN2 , DEN3 , DEN4 ) , cause various illness , include dengue fever , severe disease , dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome ( DHF/DSS ) . This study evaluate safety immune response two dos dengue virus vaccine ( TV003 ) administer 12 month apart healthy adult . The study also evaluate whether candidate vaccine may protect four type dengue virus . Participants randomly assign receive TV003 study vaccine placebo vaccine . At study entry , participant undergo blood collection physical examination , female participant take pregnancy test . Participants receive injection assign vaccine . They take temperature three time day 16 day vaccination record result diary card , research staff review participant ' study visit . Additional study visit occur Days 3 , 10 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 56 , 90 , 180 , 270 , 330 . All study visit include blood collection physical examination ; select visit include pregnancy test female participant . At study visit Day 360 , participant receive injection vaccine receive study entry . Additional study visit occur Days 363 , 370 , 374 , 381 , 388 , 416 , 450 , 540 , include study procedure previously perform .</detailed_description>
