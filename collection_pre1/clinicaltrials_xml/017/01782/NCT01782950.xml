	<detailed_description>During study periodic monitoring conduct ensure protocol Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs ) followed.The monitor may review source document confirm data record CRFs accurate . The study site may subject review Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) and/or appropriate regulatory authority . A CRF complete include subject sign investigator authorized staff member attest data true . Any correction entry make CRFs , source document must date , initial explain ( necessary ) obscure original entry . Qualit assurance also perform regularly CRFs . The primary end point analyze use Time event ( cure , death , relapse etc ) analysis failure rate hazard ratio calculate accordig categorical drug concentration propose cutt offs . Secondary end point analyse use time event occurence toxicity also corelated drug concentration .</detailed_description>
