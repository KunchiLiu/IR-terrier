	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn experimental treatment help think ability , memory Veterans Gulf War Veterans Illnesses ( GWVI ) . The experimental treatment use light-emitting diode ( LEDs ) , apply outside skull , head use helmet line near-infrared diode . LEDs also place nostril ( one red diode : one near-infrared diode ) , possibly deliver photon deep part brain . A treatment take 30 minute . The participant receive series LED treatment take place outpatient visit VA Boston Healthcare System , Jamaica Plain Campus . The LEDs contain red near-infrared diode . The FDA considers LED device use , non-significant risk device . The LEDs produce heat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scalp Application Red Near-Infrared Light , From Light-Emitting Diodes ( LED ) Improve Thinking Memory Veterans With Gulf War Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The rational use red near-infrared LEDs two-fold : 1 ) These wavelength show improve ATP production , especially hypoxic compromised cell . 2 ) Recent study human also show increase regional cerebral blood flow subjacent near-infrared LEDs place scalp ( Schiffer et al. , 2009 ; Nawashiro et al. , 2012 ) . General Explanation Light-Emitting Diode ( LED ) Treatment Procedure : The LED treatment take place outpatient visit VA Boston Healthcare System ( VABHS ) Jamaica Plain Campus ( JP Campus ) , 150 South Huntington Ave. , Boston , MA , 02130 . The Transcranial LED treatment procedure painless , non-invasive heat generate . It involve place lightweight helmet head intranasal device nostrils . The helmet contain light-emitting diode ( LEDs ) . Some LEDs visible range light one see ( red wavelength light ) ; LEDs visible ( near-infrared wavelength light ) . The participant ask wear goggles/glasses LED treatment . These goggles/glasses block red wavelength light , participant aware light , . During LED treatment , light turn . During LED treatment , light turn . All participant part study receive LED treatment LED light turn . The participant feel anything LED light ; painless , noninvasive treatment procedure . There small fan build LED helmet ( assist cooling ) . The participant always hear fan , LED treatment , whether LEDs , . There 2 sequential part LED treatment visit , LED helmet head : Part 1 : The LEDs center helmet 14 minute ; turn . Part 2 : The LEDs leave right side helmet 14 minute ; . During Parts 1 2 , intranasal device 25 minute . The entire treatment LED helmet place head 30 minute , per treatment visit . There potential eye damage , LED light laser light . The participant remain street clothes , treat soft recliner chair . Each visit last 35 45 minute , allow time record keep . No liquids gel use hold LEDs place head . Each participant provide his/her clear plastic liner LED helmet . This clear plastic liner assign participant , use participant . It keep locked filing cabinet treatment room , discard participant 's completion study . There 15 visit LED treatment series ; participant participate two LED treatment series . Each LED treatment series last 7.5 week . Each LED treatment visit schedule twice per week , least 48 hour visit . All appointment schedule ahead , specific day time day , convenience participant . If participant need miss appointment , appointment re-scheduled . However , participant miss 1 appointment row , two-week period , he/she withdrawn study . This important treat least two time per week 7.5 week , 15 LED treatment complete , two LED treatment series . The length time participation actual treatment portion study four month ( two treatment period two month , ) . The total time participation include pre- testing , final follow-up test 2 month last LED treatment visit , 6 month . This study sponsor Department Veterans Affairs , Clinical Science Research Development . There potential conflict interest associate research . Referral Screening Potential Participants : As mention separate section Subjects Inclusion Criteria , participant study refer Neuropsychologist follow Veterans New England region deploy Kuwait 1990-91 . Additional participant may recruit source . After sign ICF , time neuropsychological screening , Gulf War Veterans part Fort Devens cohort give `` Symptom Questions use Identify Gulf War Illness Kansas Case Definition , Chronic Multisymptom Illness Fukuda Case Definition '' questionnaire . Qualified participant answered 'Yes ' follow question : 1 ) Difficulty concentrate ; and/or 2 ) Difficulty remember recent information . After referral study , potential participant contact telephone , description full study protocol explain , include three blood draw involve , well time require , reimbursement time effort . After initial contact telephone , initial visit VABHS , JP campus may schedule PI , someone staff . At time , entire study explain question answer . If potential participant wish , he/she may sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) first visit . After ICF sign , appointment schedule Neuropsychological Screening test . These test measure ability think remember recent information . If result Neuropsychological Screening test show potential participant eligible entry study , additional appointment schedule Additional Neuropsychological Testing perform , Additional Health Information obtain . The Additional Neuropsychological Tests also measure ability think remember recent information . These test take place VABHS , JP . They administer neuropsychologist staff , require two-hour visit . During two-hour visit , Additional Health Information ( paper pencil ) acquire follow area : 1 ) pain experience regular basis ; 2 ) fatigue experience regular basis ; 3 ) mood ( include depression ) ; 4 ) question regard health - example , often past 30 day symptom may present nine body system : cardiac , pulmonary , dermatological , gastrointestinal , genitourinary , musculoskeletal , neurological , psychological . The Additional Neuropsychological Tests ( Additional Health Information ) acquire four time participation study : Time 1 ) Within 1 2 week 1st LED Treatment Time 2 ) Within 1 week 15th LED treatment First Series LED Treatments Time 3 ) Within 1 week 15th LED treatment Second Series LED Treatments Time 4 ) At 2 month 15th LED treatment Second Series LED Treatments Three Blood Draws Blood sample ( venipuncture participant 's arm ) take three time point participation study . Each blood draw involve one visit Quest Lab locate near participant 's home place work . Time Schedule Blood Draws : Time 1 ) Within 1 2 week 1st LED Treatment Time 2 ) Within 1 week 15th LED treatment , 1st LED Treatment Series ( 7.5 Weeks ) Time 3 ) Within 1 week 15th LED treatment , 2nd LED Treatment Series ( 7.5 Weeks ) In summary , total 4 visit area `` Additional Neuropsychological Tests Additional Health Information , '' 3 visit Quest Lab Blood Tests . Statistical Analyses Power Statement : There two group participant , 80 participant per group . A score 3 cognitive domain analyze pre- post- LED intervention : 1 . Attention/Executive Function : Digit Span Subtests ( WAIS-IV ; Wechsler , 2008 ) ; Trail-Making Test ( Delis , Kaplan , Kramer , 2001 ) ; Color Word Interference Test ( Stroop ) ( Delis , Kaplan , Kramer , 2001 ) 2 . Learning Memory : California Verbal Learning Test-II ( CVLT-II ; Delis , Kramer , Kaplan , &amp; Ober , 2000 ) 3 . Psychomotor/Visual Spatial ; Continuous Performance Test ( Administered computer ; RVisual CPT , NES3 ) ( Letz &amp; Baker , 1988 ; Rosvold et al. , 1956 ) ; Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test ( ROCF ) ( Knight &amp; Kaplan , 2004 ) Power Analysis : Power compute follow assumption ANOVA : ) alpha = .05 ( 1-tail ) ; b ) establish clinical relevance , Cohen 's large effect size ( .25 ) use . Power = .86 detect significant between-group difference change Baseline end Treatment interim analysis .</detailed_description>
