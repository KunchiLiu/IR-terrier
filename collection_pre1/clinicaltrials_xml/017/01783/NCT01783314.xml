	<brief_summary>When someone hepatitis C condition cause liver injury , develop condition call liver fibrosis time , cause liver stop work normally . Currently , best way determine degree fibrosis liver biopsy . The investigator hope show measuring degree liver fibrosis use MRI gadoxetate disodium good well obtain information perform liver biopsy . Gadoxetate disodium contrast solution give vein consider safe , approve use Food Drug Administration , already routinely give patient various form liver disease , include fibrosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Imaging Biomarker Hepatic Fibrosis Using Gadoxetate Disodium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver damage , variety cause , lead condition call liver fibrosis . Common cause chronic alcohol use hepatitis C infection . The condition progress cirrhosis liver failure , seventh lead cause death United States . Presently , biopsy remain reliable way test whether various treatment propose work , risk biopsy preclude frequent re-assessment . Hence , truly personalized treatment hamper lack non-invasive , low-risk , appropriately qualified test periodic assessment may make . In July 2008 , FDA approve new drug call Eovist absorb liver cell see liver perform MRI . The amount time course Eovist absorption different health fibrotic liver tissue . We believe parameter , combination hematological immunological blood test , predict degree liver fibrosis without need biopsy . This would allow improved assessment potentially important intervention might alter course underlying disease . Thus development non-invasive biomarker might obviate need biopsy , might addition allow intensive periodic assessment possible currently .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : subject Hepatitis C schedule obtain liver biopsy future obtain liver biopsy 6 month prior plan MR image subject healthy , without liver disease ( use normal control ) All subpopulation regard gender , race ethnicity equal opportunity inclusion study protocol . The study protocol include adult population consistent age ( &gt; 21 year old ) presentation . Exclusion criterion : subject contraindication obtain MRI intravenous contrast include : metal body , severe renal impairment , pregnancy , breast feeding . Contraindications identify use screen questionnaire provide routine clinical examination . Subjects history allergy MRI contrast dye Severe renal impairment define glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 . All subject screen questionnaire . The GFR calculate subject report kidney problem history kidney problem use blood chemistry perform within 6 week plan date MRI examination . These blood chemistry would need performed part routine clinical care . A potential subject report kidney problem history kidney problem blood chemistry available within 6 week MRI examination exclude participation study .</criteria>
