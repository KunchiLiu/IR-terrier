	<brief_summary>The pathophysiology Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ( TON ) think multifactorial , researcher also postulate primary secondary mechanism injury.TON categorize direct indirect.In indirect TON case , injury axon think induced shearing force transmit fiber vascular supply nerve . Studies show force apply frontal bone malar eminence transfer concentrated area near optic canal . The tight adherence optic nerve 's dural sheath periosteum within optic canal also think contribute segment nerve extremely susceptible deformative stress skull bone . Such injury lead ischemic injury axon retinal ganglion cell within optic canal . At present , study validate particular approach management TON . There three management line patient include 1 ) observation ; 2 ) medical treatment high megadoses methylprednisolone ; 3 ) surgical intervention . Generally line precede others additionally , medical surgical intervention may result serious side effect complication . In 2005 , result Corticosteroid Randomization Significant Head Injury ( CRASH ) trial raise concern regard use mega dose steroid traumatic brain injury . This study large randomize study evaluate steroid patient traumatic brain injury stop early due significantly increase risk death patient receive mega dose steroid 6-month follow-up compare placebo group ( 25.7 % vs 22.3 % ; Relative Risk 1.15 Confidence Interval 1.07 1.24 ; p=0.0001 ) . Although etiology increase risk death determine , finding study take consideration manage case TON concurrent traumatic brain injury . Very recently show cytokine hormone erythropoietin ( EPO ) long know use valuable agent promote hematopoiesis protective experimental model mechanical trauma , neuroinflammation , cerebral retinal ischemia , even human stroke trial , notably optic nerve transection . A double blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial EPO add-on treatment chronic schizophrenic men perform . Treatment 12 week high-dose weekly ( 40,000 IU intravenously ) EPO lead significant improvement cognitive performance compare placebo control . Different study perform effect EPO neuropathy different study . The investigator recently publish result treat patient TON EPO find safe effective . Patients compare historical control group patient receive treatment TON . A well visual recovery find . The aim study determine effectiveness EPO TON Multi- center clinical trial use semi-experimental design .</brief_summary>
