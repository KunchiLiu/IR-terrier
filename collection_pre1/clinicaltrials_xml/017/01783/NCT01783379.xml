	<brief_summary>In trial , goal determine pharmacokinetics micafungin non-selected cohort patient suspect proven invasive fungal infection . Patients receive micafungin period necessary achieve clinical / mycological cure . An attempt make 2 PK curve , one full one limited sample day 3 ( n=9 ) 7 ( n=5 ) . Furthermore , able determine intra-individual variability . On non-PK day , trough sample take determine time steady state . All sample take prior morning dose micafungin . All infusion rate accord SPC label information . Patients consider evaluable least first PK curve complete . Two moment PK analysis enable u determine whether increase time exposure steady state reach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Whilst micafungin ( MycamineÂ® ) much offer , little know pharmacokinetic profile ICU patient specific co-morbidities obesity , hypoalbumenia , severe liverfunction disturbance . Also , ICU patient know experience change pharmacokinetics ( PK ) due change hemodynamics , extracorporeal elimination technique , interact comedication , etc . Based criterion outline , micafungin may prove drug choice cohort patient . Therefore seem prudent conduct trial cohort patient receive micafungin co-variates may influence pharmacokinetic profile . To build valid pharmacokinetic model , patient micafungin include analysis use model building . Co-variates explore least : obesitas , liverfunction , albumin , creatinin-clearance . Simulations perform determine adequate exposure reach different patho-physiological condition . In conclusion : trial determine PK micafungin non-selected cohort patient suspect proven invasive fungal infection . Most important covariates model use advanced mathematical technique . Micafungin may prove beneficial two echinocandins term limited factor impact PK . This proven prospective trial .</detailed_description>
