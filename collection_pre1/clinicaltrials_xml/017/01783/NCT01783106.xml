	<brief_summary>There grow evidence Crohn 's disease may cause replication bacteria , perhaps particularly E. coli , within macrophage ( specialized sort white blood cell ) . Laboratory study show combination antibiotic penetrate macrophage ( ciprofloxacin doxycycline ) together anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine ( make content macrophage vesicle alkaline help kill intracellular bacteria ) particularly effective kill E. coli within macrophage .</brief_summary>
