	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether patient meet criterion Postural Tachycardia Syndrome ( ) reduce blood volume ( ) . Both important screening element Aim 3 National Institutes Health Grant . The purpose Aim 3 determine 1. whether high dietary sodium level appropriately expand plasma volume Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia , 2. whether plasma renin activity aldosterone modify appropriately change dietary sodium Postural Tachycardia Syndrome 3. whether patient Postural Tachycardia Syndrome improvement orthostatic tachycardia symptom result high dietary sodium level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The protocol consist screen visit evaluation autonomic nervous system status . The following activity part study . Subjects may stay 2 night 3 study day . Day 0 Participants admit Clinical Research Center , medical history , physical exam , routine lab work ( hemoglobin/hematocrit &amp; CMP ) serum pregnancy test do first day . They also ask fill health questionnaire . Later day evaluate determine extent fatigue , depression anxiety rating , autonomic symptom quality life , use questionnaire . Subjects may ask stop take medication 7 day ; decide individual basis consider medication effect autonomic nervous system . If subject ask discontinue medication , ask keep diary symptom contact PI staff phone new symptom appear . If necessary , medication restart . Testing day 1 : In morning posture test , 5 teaspoon blood drawn subject lying , sit stand 30 minute measure substance produce body response inflammation oxidative stress determine hormone regulate blood pressure . Blood pressure heart rate measure different position . A total 10 tablespoon draw . In afternoon , test perform design determine well autonomic nervous system work regulate blood pressure heart rate . Autonomic function test perform see involuntary nervous system work . For test , heart rate record use continuous electrocardiographic trace , blood pressure use cuff around one arm and/or finger heart 's pumping capacity ( cardiac output ) measure analyze shift fluid body ( body impedance ) and/or analyze air breathe . Participants tilt tilt table 10 minute record heart rate blood pressure . The autonomic function test include ask participant breathe deeply two minute breathe rapidly 30 second , maintain handgrip 3 minute , blow pressure 15 second place one hand ice water 1 minute . All test mean stimulate autonomic nervous system produce change blood pressure heart rate short duration reflect well involuntary nervous system work . Testing day 2 : In morning , total blood volume measure use iodinate I-131 tag human serum albumin , material small amount radioactive substance . The test involve draw blood sample I-131 give , give I-131 catheter one vein , wait 12 minute second blood sample drawn check concentration . Blood sample also draw subject lie measure hormone , control blood pressure heart rate . Blood draw several point study . The total amount blood drawn study approximately 3 teaspoon . In afternoon , exercise capacity test estimation maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) do . This test conduct stationary bicycle resistance gradually increase expired air measure exhaustive physical work . The test last approximately 30 minute . A mouthpiece one way re-breathing valve attach breathe tube use collect air sample exercise test . Essentially , subject breathe room air mouthpiece , expire air tube connects machine ( metabolic cart ) . This machine analyze carbon dioxide oxygen content , allow u calculate amount oxygen use rest exercise condition . The workload gradually increase bike increase resistance . As workload increase , oxygen consumption also increase . Throughout test period exhale air collect . When subject longer continue , test stop . Blood pressure measure end resistance-stage . Heart rate data record continuously . Before complete exercise test , subject require complete `` warm-up '' `` cool-down '' session include stretch exercise .</detailed_description>
