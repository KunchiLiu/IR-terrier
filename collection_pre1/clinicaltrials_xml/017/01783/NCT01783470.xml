	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis human brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) activate use β3-adrenergic receptor ( AR ) agonist . The efficacy β3-AR agonist compare cold exposure , already show activate human BAT , well placebo control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study include outpatient screen visit three separate , independent overnight study visit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) . Screening procedure consist medical history , physical examination , blood draw , ECG . If , screen test , determine eligibility criterion meet , healthy volunteer participate three separate inpatient visit BIDMC . Study procedures occur GCRC Nuclear Medicine suite BIDMC . Volunteers first complete Day A , measure BAT volume activity cold exposure . Cold exposure consist wear cool vest 55 - 61°F , temperature show cool enough activate brown adipose tissue warm enough lead shivering . Resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) measure indirect calorimetry cool exposure . If detectable brown fat activity Day A , volunteer participate Days B C. Days B C conduct random order reduce bias sequence treatment scan , well potential placebo effect . Day B consist pharmacological stimulation β3-AR agonist . On Day C , volunteer give placebo control undergo cooling . A blood draw 26 cc always do prior FDG injection FDG PET/CT always perform 60 minute FDG injection . On Day A , FDG inject 60 minute cool exposure volunteer remain cool vest another 60 minute FDG injection . To compare energy expenditure BAT mass activity among volunteer , normalize data fat muscle mass . Whole-body regional fat muscle mass measure via Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan end Day A .</detailed_description>
