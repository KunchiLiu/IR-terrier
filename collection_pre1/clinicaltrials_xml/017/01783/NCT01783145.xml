	<brief_title>Shared Care Follow-up After Chemotherapy Testicular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Since introduction cisplatin , metastatic testicular cancer ( TC ) become highly curable disease . Successfully treated TC patient small chance relapse . In case relapse , early treatment improve outcome . This stress need frequent stringent follow-up scheme . Although chemotherapy effective treatment , downside treatment become apparent : chemotherapy-related complication increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) secondary malignancy . CVD manifest treatment , also year decades thereafter . We recently observe early development cardiovascular risk factor TC patient , cluster metabolic syndrome . Monitoring treatment cardiovascular risk factor follow-up important low chance develop CVD . Since TC survivor discharge follow-up 10 year , collaboration oncologist general practitioner ( GPs ) , word share care , ensure monitor cardiovascular risk factor timely detection treatment late effect ( cardiovascular risk management ) . Survivorship care plan cancer survivor , GPs oncologists facilitate care long-term survivor . The testicular cancer survivor key person , empowered participate follow-up program make lifestyle adjustment decrease risk late effect improve quality life life expectancy . However , data scarce design evidence base effective follow-up schedule . For childhood cancer survivor detail guideline develop serve framework adult cancer survivor follow-up . Objective : To examine safety feasibility share care survivorship care plan ( SCP ) follow-up patient metastatic testicular cancer completion chemotherapy result complete remission . Study population : Patients achieve complete remission chemotherapy metastatic testicular cancer start follow-up currently active follow-up .</detailed_description>
