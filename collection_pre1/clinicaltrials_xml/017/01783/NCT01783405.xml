	<detailed_description>Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) common autosomal dominant disease country , include Spain . Its prevalence estimate one every 350-500 people higher certain area certain genetic isolation French Canadians , Christian Lebanese , `` Afrikaners '' South Africa . The HF characterize high concentration LDL cholesterol , familial autosomal dominant pattern , tendon xanthoma increase risk premature coronary disease . Without drug treatment , approximately 50 % men age 50 year percentage woman age 60 suffer serious manifestation cardiovascular disease . It estimate HF limit life expectancy 20 year males 12 year woman , effective treatment priority cardiovascular prevention . Most case HF cause mutation gene encode receptor LDL particle ( LDLR ) . More 1000 different mutation LDLR gene ( LDLR ) describe cause HF , many specific territory population group . In Spain describe 235 different mutation one best study population world genetic point view . This Spain efficient tool genetic diagnosis HF , refer Lipochip ® ( Progenika Biopharma , Derio , Vizcaya ) , allow u pioneer world diagnosis treatment HF . Most case HF Spain , especially case genetic diagnosis , represent true diagnosis , control Lipid Unit network Spanish Atherosclerosis Society ( SEA ) distribute throughout national territory , many case use homogeneous clinical criterion clinical management patient . For reason SEA ideal set study wide range subject HF , especially require accurate diagnosis . The advent statins landmark people suffer HF . Since late 80 last century class drug . They reduce almost normalize LDL concentration FH substantively alter natural progression disease . However , health impact bring statin HF unknown . Indirect data UK Simon Broome Register suggest subject HF good prognosis 20 year ago register many limitation make difficult know real impact treatment . Retrospective , obervacional , multicenter , base Lipid Units Sociedad Española de Arteriosclerosis . Our hypothesis statins improved cardiovascular prognosis recent year heterozygous FH subject . The objective project establish current prevalence cardiovascular disease adult subject suffer genetically diagnose HF , know impact drug treatment course cardiovascular disease compare affect parent much long period exposure hypercholesterolemia . To establish current prevalence cardiovascular disease adult subject suffer genetically diagnose HF To know impact drug treatment result cardiovascular disease compare affected parent longer period exposure hypercholesterolemia .</detailed_description>
