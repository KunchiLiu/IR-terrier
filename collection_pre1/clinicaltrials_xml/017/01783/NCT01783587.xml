	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use side effect may cause . Afatinib study clinical trial participant head neck cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer . This dose Afatinib also study research study . This first clinical trial study Afatinib combination Radiation Therapy . The purpose study determine safest dose Afatinib give combination Radiation Therapy combination Radiation Therapy chemotherapy head neck cancer . Afatinib drug may stop cancer cell grow abnormally . This drug work block multiple protein know play role growth cancer cell . Information laboratory research study suggest drug may help make head neck cancer cell sensitive Radiation Therapy . The therapy research study Radiation Therapy Radiation Therapy plus chemotherapy drug call Docetaxel . After surgery , Radiation Therapy chemotherapy standard treatment high risk disease . `` High risk disease '' mean without additional therapy , high risk disease may return . In study , participant high-risk disease receive Radiation Therapy Docetaxel Afatinib . `` Intermediate risk '' mean intermediate risk disease may return . Radiation Therapy alone standard treatment approach intermediate risk cancer . In study , participant intermediate risk disease receive Radiation Therapy Afatinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Afatinib Postoperative Radiation Therapy Treat Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If willing take part study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligibility . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even take part research study . If already test procedure recently , may may repeat . The test procedure include : review medical history , physical exam , blood sample , urine sample , serum pregnancy test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram assessment disease find extent cancer . If test show eligible participate research study , may begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . We collect archive tumor specimen ( leftover tissue prior surgery biopsy ) confirm cancer diagnosis . Additional test tumor specimen may perform part future study gain new knowledge head neck cancer . You receive Afatinib pill take mouth 7 week . During first week , receive Afatinib alone . During second seventh week , receive Afatinib together Radiation Therapy OR Docetaxel Radiation Therapy . Docetaxel give intravenously , week Week 2 Week 7 . Not everyone participate research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . Afatinib need take empty stomach . Specific instruction include drug diary need complete . If take part research study , receive radiation would receive study . The radiation typically do daily Monday Friday 6-7 week . You sign separate consent form radiation oncologist outline expect treatment . You give physical exam every week treatment . You physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . You blood test every week treatment include chemistry hematology test pregnancy test woman capable become pregnant receive first infusion docetaxel . You also ask return clinic one week , four week eight week finish treatment . Most visit part routine visit finish treatment . If stop study early reason , also clinic visit . In either instance , follow exam procedure perform : physical exam , blood test , test include electrocardiogram , MUGA scan echocardiogram , CT scan PET/CT scan .</detailed_description>
