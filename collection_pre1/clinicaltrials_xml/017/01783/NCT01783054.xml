	<criteria>Patient histologically cytologically confirm potentially resectable adenocarcinoma pancreas include tumor pancreatic head , uncinate process , neck , body tail potentially resectable pancreaticoduodenectomy ( KauschWhipple procedure ) . Patients islet cell neuroendocrine neoplasms exclude . Definition localize , potentially resectable disease : Staging intravenous contrastenhanced thin section helical abdominal compute tomography ( 2.5 mm cut less ) MRI ( patient IV contrast allergy ) use pancreatic protocol . Endoscopic ultrasound require tissue acquisition stag confirmation . No extension superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) hepatic artery . Patent superior mesenteric vein/portal vein ( SMV/PV ) &lt; 180degree abutment evidence invasion . Clear fat plane SMA celiac axis . No extension celiac axis hepatic artery . Patent superior mesenteric vein portal vein . No evidence distant disease . Male nonpregnant nonlactating female , ≥ 18 year age . If female patient childbearing potential , must negative serum pregnancy test document within 72 hour first administration study drug . If sexually active , patient must agree use contraception consider adequate appropriate Investigator . Patient must receive prior chemotherapy radiation pancreatic cancer . Patient acceptable blood count outline protocol . Patient ECOG performance status PS 02 . Patient informed nature study , agree participate study , sign Informed Consent Form prior participation studyrelated activity . Patient borderline resectable , locally advance unresectable advanced metastatic disease . Patients adenocarcinoma distal pancreatic body tail ineligible . Patients endocrine tumor , lymphoma pancreas , ampullary cancer also ineligible . Patient active , uncontrolled bacterial , viral , fungal infection ( ) require systemic therapy . Patient known infection HIV . Patient undergone major surgery , diagnostic surgery ( i.e.surgery do obtain biopsy diagnosis without removal organ ) , within 4 week prior Day 1 treatment study . Patient history allergy hypersensitivity study drug . Patient serious medical risk factor involve major organ system Investigator considers unsafe patient receive chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy . Patients require chronic use immunosuppressive agent ( e.g . methotrexate , cyclosporine ) . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree five year . Patients must clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ) &lt; 1 year randomization . Patient unwilling unable comply study procedure . Patient enrol therapeutic clinical protocol investigational trial . Patients age ≥ 80 exclude . However , candidate age group thoroughly evaluate enrollment study , ensure fit receive chemotherapy , potentially undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy . In addition meeting baseline patient selection criterion , clinical judgment susceptibility infection expect stability performance status suitability receive intensive chemotherapy cycle , pay special attention . Patients enrol study hesitation consideration . Baseline criterion patient enrol study must carefully evaluate criterion follow appropriately .</criteria>
