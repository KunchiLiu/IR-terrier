	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy sequential combination therapy Nivolumab Ipilimumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Nivolumab Given Sequentially With Ipilimumab Subjects With Advanced Metastatic Melanoma ( CheckMate 064 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order evaluate potential synergistic activity nivolumab ipilimumab also may differences biology tumor stable respond therapy clinically progress , study , CA209064 , look two sequential combination regimens second agent administer immediately pre-specified duration therapy first agent delayed time progression first agent . This sequential study design look pharmacodynamic change treatment one agent may predict clinical activity subsequent treatment alternate agent . This do scientifically proven whether order nivolumab ipilimumab give clinically important .</detailed_description>
