	<brief_summary>Populations consume non-fortified plant-based diet increase risk iron zinc deficiency . The purpose randomize control study determine absorption iron zinc pearl millet biofortified two micronutrient . Forty child age 2 year Kanartaka , India randomize consume biofortified pearl millet ( Group 1 ) control pearl millet ( Group 2 ) two day . Quantities zinc iron absorb measure established stable isotope extrinsic label technique analysis duplicate diet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nutritional deficiency iron 30-70 % young child different community India well document proved challenging eradicate India globally . Less known zinc deficiency , zinc iron generally present food also grow evidence public health importance zinc deficiency young child global basis . In population depend primarily plant-based food , biofortification major food staple traditional selective plant breeding procedure offer attractive strategy prevent iron zinc deficiency age group . Pearl millet , major food staple several area India , naturally relatively high concentration iron zinc demonstrate potential increase level plant breeding . Before embark complex , costly efficacy , effectiveness study potential health benefit biofortified grain , objective project determine extent iron zinc absorption increase young child consume pearl millet primary grain major food staple . This short term , cross-sectional double-blinded study test control pearl millet feed total 9 day . Primary outcome measure increase iron zinc absorption two-day period . Test meal label zinc stable isotope Day 8 iron stable isotope Days 8 9 day participant mother stay community health center . Food intake weighed duplicate diet obtain . Percentage iron absorption determine erythrocyte enrichment Day 23 . Fractional zinc absorption measure urine enrichment orally intravenously administer zinc isotope time sample collect Days 12-15 . Daily absorption mineral determine . Increases intake absorption mineral ( mg/d ) evaluate respect estimate dietary physiologic requirement .</detailed_description>
