	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Three HIV Vaccine Schedules Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NOTE : This study stop enrol new participant , study vaccination currently enrol participant stop . This study evaluate safety immune response three different vaccine schedule DNA HIV vaccine ( DNA-HIV-PT123 ) follow NYVAC HIV vaccine boost ( NYVAC-HIV-PT1 NYVAC-HIV-PT4 ) healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . Study researcher also evaluate safety administer HIV vaccine shorter administration schedule . This study take place two part . Participants Part A study receive DNA HIV vaccine faster schedule usual : Days 0 , 14 , 28 . At study entry , participant undergo physical examination , HIV risk reduction counseling , interview questionnaire . Female participant take pregnancy test . Study visit occur Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 140 , 224 . These study visit include procedure perform study entry , well blood collection , urine collection , HIV test . Study researcher evaluate participant data Part A study , safety concern , enroll participant Part B study . Participants Part B study randomly assign one three group , within group , participant randomly assign receive placebo vaccine . Participants receive DNA HIV vaccine placebo Days 0 , 14 , 28 ( Group 2 ) ; Days 0 28 ( Group 3 ) ; Days 0 , 28 , 56 ( Group 4 ) . The NYVAC HIV vaccine boost administer Day 84 ( Groups 2 3 ) 140 ( Group 4 ) . Participants Part B study , Groups 2 3 , attend study visit Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 84 , 98 , 168 , 273 . Participants Part B Group 4 attend study visit Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 70 , 140 , 154 , 224 , 334 . Participants Part B study undergo study procedure occur Part A study , addition cardiac symptom assessment perform study visit . Participants Part B receive NYVAC vaccine placebo prior study vaccination stop contact phone e-mail year 5 year enrol study follow-up health monitoring .</detailed_description>
