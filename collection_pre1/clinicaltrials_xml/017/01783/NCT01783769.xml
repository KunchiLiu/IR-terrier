	<brief_title>Evaluating Impact That Personnel Traffic Through Operating Room Has Surgical Site Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infections occur direct result patient ' stay hospital call `` nosocomial infection . '' One common type nosocomial infection occur result surgical procedure patient undergo hospital . These nosocomial infection occur result surgical procedure refer surgical site infection ( SSI ) , associate increase patient morbidity well approximately $ 1.5 billion add healthcare expense annually . Under nascent Patient Protection Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) , SSI rate use government justify alteration reimbursement rate hospital physician patient care . As result , SSIs utmost interest surgeon , hospital healthcare provider , general . One suspected cause SSI 's increased personnel traffic thru operating room surgery . The logic involve fact bacteria capable cause SSI 's present normal air . The air within operating room constantly filter , order decrease bacterial load within air hopefully decrease likelihood patient develop SSI . When personnel open door connect operating room outside hallway , dirty , unfiltered air hallway able mix clean , filter air within operating room . This increase bacterial load within operating room , potentially increase risk patient develop SSI . However , class I data exist demonstrate level personnel traffic thru operating room surgery significant effect SSI 's . Nevertheless , Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) Accreditation Manual Hospitals , well United States ' Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) guideline infection control emphasize importance traffic pattern surgical suite , well limit number personnel involve procedure . Other national organization Association Operating Room Nurses ( AORN ) make similar recommendation personnel traffic thru operating room limit surgical procedure . Although recommendation appear logical , create significant performance pressure operate room personnel , limit ability carry duty surgery limit mobility in-and-out operating room . These restriction especially difficult implement teach institution like Barrow Neurological Institute ( BNI ) attract international observer travel country , order stand inside operating room watch learn neurosurgeon . Therefore , prior institute restriction personnel movement thru operating room , investigator feel imperative class I data generate , order either prove disprove level personnel traffic operate room correlate infection rate . In order generate class 1 data , investigator propose prospective , randomized trial , hereafter refer BRITE Trial , conduct Barrow Neurological Institute ( BNI ) St Joseph 's Hospital &amp; Medical Center ( SJHMC ) , Phoenix , Arizona . The BRITE Trial enroll eligible patient undergo surgical procedure within BNI Operating Rooms period one year , start January 1 , 2013 . The BNI Operating Rooms contain 11 operating room surgery conduct daily basis . The investigator plan divide 11 BNI operate room 2 different group : Group A Group B . Group A operating room # 1 thru # 5 . Group B operate room # 6 thru # 11 . Investigators plan randomize Group A Group B either `` Normal O.R . Traffic '' `` Low O.R . Traffic '' protocol . The randomization occur dichotomous fashion Group A Group B never simultaneously randomize O.R . Traffic protocol . The randomization occur 6 a.m. Monday morning new week , randomization designation last 7 consecutive day . Randomization occur thru standard randomization computer program ( www.random.org ) weekly designation place within sealed envelope . The seal envelope week open 6 a.m. Monday morning week . The group operate room designate `` Low O.R . Traffic '' protocol sign inside outside door connect operating room . The `` Low O.R . Traffic '' protocol group also require adhere new set rule regulation . The group operate room designate `` Normal O.R . Traffic '' protocol sign door follow normal standard O.R . personnel traffic , per routine . Data reflect personnel movement collect via proprietary `` personnel count system '' ( Traf-Sys , Pittsburgh , PA ) . The `` personnel count system '' operate via infrared beam mount outside every operating room door . When person walk thru operate room door , infrared beam broken system record movement single person . These data track 24 hour day , 7 day week 365 day period . An interim analysis conduct 6 month . Primary outcome return BNI operating room wound washout within 12 month . Secondary outcome return BNI operating room reason . Our goal BRITE Trial 2-fold . First , investigator want determine whether institute Low O.R . Traffic protocol actually lead decreased O.R . personnel traffic thru operating room . Second , investigator want determine whether increased level O.R . personnel traffic thru operating room lead increase rate SSI 's .</detailed_description>
