	<brief_summary>Hip fracture common problem among old individual . This year United States approximately 350,000 people age 65 old break hip . Despite improvement therapy , hip fracture still result decrease strength bone muscle , make difficult walk perform daily activity . Activity exercise believe benefit reduce disability old adult , yet majority old adult participate regular exercise active . This especially true old adult follow hip fracture complete usual rehabilitation program . This study do compare two 16-week supervise multi-part physical therapy program ( intervention ) initiate 26 week hip fracture . The investigator want test whether intervention lead improvement person 's ability walk home local community . With knowledge investigator hope help great number hip fracture patient enjoy complete recovery improve overall health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Community Ambulation After Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvement medical management , significant residual disability remain old person hip fracture . The goal current clinical practice independent , safe household ambulation two three month surgery . Hip fracture-acquired dependency functional activity daily live persists well beyond three month post-surgery . One year hip fracture , 20 % patient need help put pant , 50 % need assistance walk , 90 % need assistance climb stair . This residual disability indicate current standard Medicare-reimbursed post-hip fracture rehabilitation ( i.e. , usual care ) fail return many patient pre-fracture level function . In contrast stroke heart disease , commonly occur acute condition old population , intervention trial focus decrease disability follow hip fracture . None trial hip fracture examine effect early post-fracture intervention ability ambulate level require independent function community ( i.e. , community ambulation ) . Thus , paucity evidence justify extend medical management beyond usual care person follow hip fracture achieve community , rather merely household , ambulation . A randomized control trial ( RCT ) include 210 old adult experience hip fracture carry three clinical site half subject receive specific multi-component intervention ( PUSH ) half receive non-specific multi-component intervention ( PULSE ) . Randomization 210 participant meet eligibility criterion take place post-acute rehabilitation end , approximately 6 month ( 26 week ) admission hospital hip fracture . The primary endpoint measure use Six-Minute Walk Test ( SMWT ) end 16-week intervention period . The goal enable old adult experience hip fracture recover sufficiently become community ambulators . In version 11.0 protocol , eliminate several secondary tertiary outcome measure . In description measure , identify measure collect participant consent protocol version 11.0 later .</detailed_description>
