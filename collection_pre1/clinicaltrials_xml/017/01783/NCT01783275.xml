	<brief_summary>It know obesity and/or physical inactivity greatly increase person 's risk develop heart disease serious health problem . This partly diabetes associated inflammation , oxidative stress , insulin resistance . Diabetes also associate high level triglyceride blood tissue liver ( know fatty liver steatosis ) . This elevation fat liver know cause liver insulin resistance impair function liver impairment contributes development diabetes . Studies show aerobic exercise weight loss beneficial result insulin resistance . However , cause benefit remains unclear . We know aerobic exercise and/or weight loss improve muscle responds insulin . However , also know aerobic exercise and/or weight loss lower liver fat content , thereby make possible liver 's response insulin also improve weight loss and/or exercise training . An improved responsiveness liver insulin could lower blood sugar level meal could also lower morning blood sugar level . However , little known exercise and/or weight loss improve liver function people type 2 diabetes . Hypothesis 1 : Improved hepatic insulin sensitivity , result either exercise training weight loss , increase amount glucose oral load take liver subject DM . We also hypothesize amount glucose take liver increase even response exercise training plus weight loss compare either treatment alone . Hypothesis 2 : Increases hepatic insulin sensitivity result exercise weight loss cause reduction EGP fast state , improve suppression EGP see response hyperinsulinemia .</brief_summary>
