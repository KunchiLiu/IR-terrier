	<brief_title>Optimization Inhaled Corticosteroid Treatment Adult Patients With Asthma Guided Exhaled NO Measurement Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design pragmatic randomized control , open-label , parallel group study Screening visit 1 visit 2 separate 2-4 week run-in period . At screen visit , Informed Consent sign atopic asthma confirm , spirometry perform questionnaire respond . At visit 2 venous blood sample take serum stored -20 °C later transport Uppsala Biobank , Exhaled NO measure visit use NIOX MINO ( blind control group ) . - The active group combination inhaler , switch Giona Easyhaler ( budesonide equivalent study entry ) Oxis ( formoterol equivalent study entry ) . These patient receive NIOX MINO teach adjustment ICS treatment accord daily exhale NO measurement home personalize treatment algorithm . - The control group stay previous controller treatment ( change indicate symptom visit ) accord usual care . - Both group switch short-acting beta-2-agonist Buventol Easyhaler . - Both group report symptom ( ACQ ) monthly connection asthma event via ePRO system ( ViedocMe , PCG ) . Active group report NO value weekly basis via system . There follow-up clinic visit 3 6 month exhale NO measurement ( blind control group ) limit set questionnaire . A second follow-up visit 4 12 month exhale NO , spirometry , full set questionnaire blood sample make .</detailed_description>
