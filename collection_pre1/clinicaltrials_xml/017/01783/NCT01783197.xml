	<brief_summary>This research do research selumetinib combination standard chemotherapy treatment need . Although number treatment option patient advance non-small cell lung cancer increase past decade , prognosis remain poor , need additional therapeutic option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Selumetinib Patients With Previously Treated Untreated Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study find high dose new drug , selumetinib , give combination standard chemotherapy , tolerate without cause severe side effect . This do start dose low one cause side effect animal . Participants give selumetinib watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If side effect severe , potential participant ask join study give high dose selumetinib . Participants join study later take selumetinib high dos , take dos twice daily take day 21 day period participant join earlier . This continue dose find cause severe temporary side effect . Doses high give .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically and/or cytologically confirm NSCLC metastatic unresectable standard curative measure exist . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) available correlative study must provide informed consent release block well blood sample correlative study . Although KRAS mutation mandatory , patient accrue RP2D expansion cohort sample send KRAS screening ; patient must also least one site disease unidimensionally measurable . Measurable disease define least one target lesion irradiate accurately measure least one dimension RECIST 1.1 criterion . Chest Xray ≥ 20 mm CT/MRI scan ( slice thickness &lt; 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm &gt; long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; measure short axis Presence clinically and/or radiologically document disease ( marker positive patient eligible ) . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior registration ( within 35 day negative ) . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 1 Patients must life expectancy least 12 week . Previous Therapy Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 14 day prior patient registration wound heal occur . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 4 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Chemotherapy systemic therapy : Patients may receive prior MEK inhibitor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( include EGFR inhibitor kind ) . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy combine chemoradiotherapy curative intent permissible provide complete least one year prior enrollment . No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy advance / metastatic disease permissible , UNLESS patient enrol pemetrexed single agent cohort . Patients cohort must candidate single agent pemetrexed , receive prior pemetrexed one prior chemotherapy regimen advance metastatic disease . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology : Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Biochemistry : Creatinine Clearance* ≥ 50 ml/min ( calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN presence liver metastasis ) Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate.Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . Treatment begin within 2 work day patient registration . Patients Asian ethnicity eligible dose escalation phase study . Asian patient may enrol RP2D follow informed consent investigator discretion . Patients history untreated malignancy malignancy require therapy within past 2 year . Patients document brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis , treat untreated . Patients significant cardiac disease , include : factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event ( e.g . heart failure , hypokalaemia , congenital long QT syndrome , family history long QT syndrome unexplained sudden death 40 year age ) mean rest correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470 msec uncontrolled hypertension ( BP ≥ 150/95 mmHg despite medical therapy ) acute coronary syndrome within 6 month prior start treatment angina Canadian Cardiovascular Society Grade IIIV ( despite medical therapy ) symptomatic heart failure ( NYHA IIIV ) prior current cardiomyopathy atrial fibrillation ventricular rate &gt; 100bpm rest severe valvular heart disease Other patient cardiac disease , meet exclusion criterion , must baseline LVEF ≥ 55 % . Patients neuropathy &gt; grade 1 condition preclude treatment standard chemotherapy regimen plan . Patients significant gastrointestinal disease unable swallow capsule . Patients potent inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 , CYP2C19 CYP1A2 ( must discontinue within 2 week prior registration ( 3 week St. John 's Wort ) . Patients agree avoid ingestion large amount grapefruit Seville orange ( product contain fruit , e.g . grapefruit juice marmalade ) . Participants take supplemental vitamin E , discontinue , eligible study . Patients require oral anticoagulant ( coumadin ) eligible provide increased vigilance respect monitor INR , upon initiation dose selumetinib . If medically appropriate treatment available , investigator consider switch patient LMW heparin . Patients current past history central serous retinopathy retinal vein occlusion , high intraocular pressure uncontrolled glaucoma ( irrespective IOP ) . Pregnant lactating woman . Women childbearing potential must urine pregnancy test proven negative within 7 day prior registration . Men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception . Patients agree avoid excessive sun exposure use adequate sunscreen protection .</criteria>
