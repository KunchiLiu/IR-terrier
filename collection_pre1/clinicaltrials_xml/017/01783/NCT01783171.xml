	<brief_title>Dinaciclib Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , safety , toxicity combination MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) dinaciclib patient advance pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( Level 2.5 , determine August 2015 : Dinaciclib 9 mg/m2 intravenously [ IV ] ; MK-2206 135 mg orally [ PO ] ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess preliminary efficacy combination MK-2206 dinaciclib metastatic pancreatic cancer patient determine disease control rate expansion cohort patient MTD . II . Characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile combination MK-2206 dinaciclib . III . Analyze pre-treatment tumor specimen activation retrovirus-associated deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence ( RAS ) downstream pathway signal potential predictor treatment benefit . IV . Correlate post-treatment pharmacodynamic ( PD ) change phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( p-ERK ) , phosphorylated-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( p-AKT ) , p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6 ) , phosphorylated DNA-directed ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) polymerase II subunit RPB1 ( pPOLR2 ) , phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) , proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen ( Ki-67 ) , cleave caspase-3 tumor biopsy peripheral blood mononuclear cell MK-2206 dinaciclib exposure treatment response demonstrate proof-of-concept assess post-treatment predictive biomarkers . V. To assess effect polymorphic variation candidate gene ( cytochrome P450 3A4/5 [ CYP3A4/5 ] , ATP-binding cassette , sub-family B [ MDR/TAP ] , member 1 [ ABCB1 ] ) genetic alteration may discover conduct study , MK-2206 dinaciclib disposition , toxicity , efficacy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive dinaciclib IV 2 hour day 1 course 1 . ARM B : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO day 1 course 1 . After day 1 , patient receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO day 1 , 8 , 15 dinaciclib IV 2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
