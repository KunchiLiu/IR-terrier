Thirty-six village , complete census available , randomize 1:1 basis intervention ( CTAs receive enhance training enhance training team ) usual assessment ( CTAs receive usual instruction regular MDA team ) . In set village CTAs keep record case screen positive TT . A Master TT grader grade screen case TT determine rate true positivity . In addition , examine random sample resident screen negative detect potentially miss case estimate total burden trichiasis case . The assessment Master TT grader serve gold standard calculation sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value enhance train versus usual assessment method .</brief_summary>
