	<brief_summary>This study subject type skin cancer call melanoma . The main purpose study examine safety study drug ( Poly-ICLC ) patient disease . The study team would like know side effect patient may give study drug . Another goal study determine combine dendritic cell study drug possibly use vaccine disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Vaccination With Poly-ICLC Peptide-pulsed Dendritic Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dendritic cell cell present body 's immune system help body fight disease . This vaccine trial , cell extract ( remove ) , treat lab , re-administered body study drug hope create immune response disease . It guarantee disease burden reduce participate trial.TScreening test conduct determine whether subject participate study . If subject eligible choose participate , procedure call leukapheresis . The leukapheresis product collect take special lab MUSC undergo process grow additional dendritic cell control condition lab . These cell give together Poly-ICLC therapy begin study treatment . Some day receive Poly-ICLC dendritic cell , day receive Poly-ICLC . After study treatment , subject may ask return MUSC approximately every 3 month first 2 year , every 6 month thereafter follow procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis melanoma metastatic and/or unresectable . If histologic diagnosis base metastatic site , histology must compatible melanoma . Patients must HLAA2 positivity serological testing . Patients must measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 Patients may prior cancer therapy . Patients need demonstrate progression consider trial . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 . Age ≥ 18 year . Patient must expect life expectancy great 3 month . Signed , write IRBapproved informed consent . Acceptable organ function : Bilirubin ≤ 3 time upper limit normal ( CTCAE Grade 2 baseline ) AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN ( CTCAE Grade 1 baseline ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 XULN ( CTCAE Grade 1 baseline ) Acceptable hematologic status : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 cells/mm3 , Platelet count ≥ 75,000 ( plt/mm3 ) , ( CTCAE Grade 1 baseline ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL . Urinalysis clinically significant abnormality . PT PTT ≤ 1.5 X ULN correction nutritional deficiency may contribute prolonged PT/PTT . Patients must serious uncontrolled acute chronic medical condition would interfere treatment . Examples would include active acute chronic infection require antibiotic , uncontrolled cardiovascular , endocrine , infectious disease . Patients must significant ongoing cardiac problem , myocardial infarction within last six month , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , uncontrolled arrhythmia congestive heart failure . Surgery le equal 14 day prior study registration Patients prior radiation chemotherapy last treatment administration less equal 28 day prior registration . Patients prior treatment ipilimumab Interleukin2 allow long 28 day washout period follow . Patients breast feed positive pregnancy test ( female ) . Patients active CNS lesion exclude ( i.e. , radiographically unstable , symptomatic lesion ) . However , patient treat stereotactic therapy surgery eligible patient remain without evidence disease progression brain stable 1 month . Whole brain radiotherapy allow , exception patient definitive resection stereotactic therapy radiologically detectable parenchymal lesion . Patients must plan receive concurrent chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy type therapy treatment cancer protocol treatment . Due undetermined effect treatment regimen patient HIV1 infection potential serious interaction antiHIV medication , patient know infected HIV eligible study . Due possibility harm fetus nursing infant treatment regimen , patient must pregnant nursing . Women men reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient disease free five year .</criteria>
