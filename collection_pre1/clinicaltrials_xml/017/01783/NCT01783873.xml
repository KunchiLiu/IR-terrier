	<brief_summary>Occupational asthma ( OA ) cause high molecular weight ( HMW ) substances show induce predominantly eosinophilic inflammation . In contrast , OA cause low molecular weight ( LMW ) substances result neutrophilic inflammation . In addition , data regard phenotype lymphocyte OA cause HMW LMW substances scarce . The use new equipment allow realization specific standardize bronchial challenge ( BC ) occupational agent . Thus , propose study detail cellular mechanism involve BC HMW LMW occupational agent double-blind placebo control study .</brief_summary>
