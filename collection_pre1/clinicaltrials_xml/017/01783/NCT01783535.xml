	<brief_summary>The primary objective protocol evaluate response rate bilateral disease participant least one eye advance intra-ocular retinoblastoma ( stratum B ) use upfront therapy chemotherapy deliver directly eye . The main biology objective improve understand biology tumorigenesis ( tumor develops ) retinoblastoma biology specimen available . As clinician , primary goal investigator child retinoblastoma provide optimal therapy use multiple treatment approach [ chemotherapy ( vein directly membrane eyeball ) , cryotherapy ( freeze destroy tumor ) , thermotherapy ( laser heat destroy tumor ) , radiation therapy , surgical removal eye need ) attempt preserve eye vision whenever possible , still cure disease . Therefore , child non-metastatic retinoblastoma St. Jude offer enrollment study . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To evaluate response ( complete + partial response ) rate bilateral disease participant least one eye advance intraocular retinoblastoma ( Stratum B ) two upfront course therapy consist subconjunctival carboplatin systemic topotecan . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate ocular survival eye event-free survival participant stratum . - To prospectively analyze intraocular disease tissue participant least one eye undergo enucleation order identify mechanism RB1 bi-allelic inactivation . Participants may undergo upfront enucleation ( due advance disease diagnosis ) may receive enucleation due progressive disease protocol therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol Study Treatment Participants With Intraocular Retinoblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants stratify four main treatment group , depend whether retinoblastoma present one eyes disease group [ early advance , Reese-Ellsworth ( R-E ) group I-V , International Classification A-E ] . Additionally , participant invite participate exploratory research objectives address cognitive functional development child retinoblastoma , pharmacokinetics topotecan young child , evaluation ototoxicity , include genetic analysis . TREATMENT PLAN STRATUM A : - Children ≥ equal 6 month old time enrollment - 8 course vincristine carboplatin , give 3-4 week interval . - Infants &lt; 6 month old time enrollment - Therapy consist six course chemotherapy ; three course vincristine carboplatin , give 3-4 week interval , alternate 3 cycle vincristine topotecan , give 3-4 week interval . Focal treatment administer discretion treat team . Focal therapy include cryotherapy , laser photocoagulation , thermo-therapy plaque radiotherapy . STRATUM B : - Participants without extensive sub-retinal ( SR ) seeding , treatment consist two up-front course vincristine topotecan , give 3-4 week interval . - Participants without SR seeding : ≥ equal partial response 2 cycle , receive three additional course vincristine-topotecan ( VT ) six course vincristine-carboplatin , give 3-4 week interval . - Participants without SR seed &lt; partial response 2 cycle VT receive 6 course vincristine-carboplatin-etoposide ( VCE ) , give 3-4 week interval . - Participants extensive sub-retinal ( SR ) seed receive two up-front course subconjunctival ( also call subtenon periocular ) CARBOplatin systemic topotecan , give 3-4 week interval . - Participants SR seed : &gt; equal partial response 2 cycle receive three additional course vincristine-topotecan , six course vincristine-carboplatin , give 3-4 week interval . - Participants SR seed : &lt; partial response 2 cycle receive 6 course VCE , give 3-4 week interval . Focal treatment administer discretion treat team . Focal therapy include cryotherapy , laser photocoagulation , thermo-therapy plaque radiotherapy . STRATUM C : Participants unilateral ( unifocal multifocal ) advance ( R-E IV-V IC D-E ) intraocular disease undergo enucleation . Adjuvant therapy base histopathology : - low risk participant : Participants enucleate eye show extra-retinal disease ( see definition intermediate high risk ) ; receive additional treatment . - intermediate risk participant : Participants enucleate eye show presence tumor anterior chamber , invasion ciliary body/iris , massive invasion choroid , invasion optic nerve beyond lamina cribrosa concomitant invasion choroid , receive 4 course adjuvant chemotherapy vincristine-carboplatin-doxorubicin ( VCD ) . - high risk participant : Participants enucleate eye show involvement sclera , involvement optic nerve level cut-end , treat 6 course chemotherapy , alternate course VCE VCD . - High-risk participant extra-ocular extension ( i.e . tumor extend beyond sclera/cornea beyond cut end optic nerve ) candidate external-beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) entire orbit , include optic nerve , administer 2 3 course treatment . Patients extra-ocular extension may consider enrollment alternative therapeutic protocol metastatic retinoblastoma ( best clinical management ) . STRATUM D : Management participant bilateral retinoblastoma often complex ; participant one eye enucleate upfront due advance disease . The decision enucleation make thorough consideration treat team . The treatment remain eye depend combination two factor : ) R-E group remain eye , b ) Histology enucleate eye . Though accumulated information regard use vincristine , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin treatment intraocular retinoblastoma , consider standard care . Therefore , participant intermediate high risk feature treat 6 course vincristine , carboplatin , etoposide ( VCE ) . Those participant enucleate eye show low risk histology eligible proceed either stratum A stratum B therapy . For receive stratum B therapy , consideration periocular carboplatin allow . External beam proton beam radiation therapy consider patient extra-ocular extension . Focal treatment administer discretion treat team . Focal therapy include cryotherapy , laser photocoagulation , thermo-therapy plaque radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
