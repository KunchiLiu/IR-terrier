	<brief_summary>This phase 1b/2 study evaluate safety clinical activity combination lapatinib , everolimus capecitabine treatment participant HER2+ breast cancer metastases brain progressed trastuzumab . The combination 2 drug able reach brain ( lapatinib everolimus ) target different part HER2 signal pathway plus chemotherapy ( capecitabine ) prove benefit metastatic breast cancer may lead improved clinical outcome participant CNS metastasis . Participants undergo brain MRIs CT scan chest abdomen evaluate response treatment , regular laboratory test echocardiogram Multi Gated Acquisition Scan ( MUGA ) ass cardiac activity</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b/2 Trial Using Lapatinib , Everolimus Capecitabine Treatment HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer With CNS Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Central nervous system ( CNS ) objective response rate 12 week : define either complete response partial response provide progression extra-CNS disease , increase steroid requirement , worsen neurologic sign symptom ( NSS ) ^34 Lesions measure use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Safety tolerability . II . Median progression free survival . III . Median overall survival . IV . CNS objective response rate clinical benefit rate ( complete response , partial response stable disease last least 6 month ) . V. Extra-CNS objective response rate accord RECIST1.1 . OUTLINE : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) everolimus PO QD day 1-21 , capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment treatment discontinuation , patient complete 2 follow visit within 7 day 30 day follow survival every 3 month 12 month .</detailed_description>
