	<brief_title>Small Bowel Cleansing Capsule Endoscopy Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capsule endoscopy ( CE ) well-known , non-invasive , diagnostic tool evaluate small bowel disease adults child . Unfortunately , CE function allow suction fluid wash small bowel mucosa examination , diagnostic yield limit presence debris , biliary secretion , bubble blood gut lumen may hide relevant finding especially distal small bowel . In addition , CE sometimes fail reach cecum within battery life capsule , result failure visualize distal small intestine . However , child problem le frequent increase intestinal motility , reduce transit time capsule . It believe clean small intestine prior examination would improve mucosal visibility endoscopy , result , diagnostic yield technique . Therefore , proposal put forward base preparation type exploration , colonoscopy ( 2 ) . Some author already study adult effect bowel preparation small-bowel visualization use different agent ; result publish series contradictory . To date , evidence benefit bowel preparation CE , far consensus optimal preparation regimen . In addition , child study topic . Therefore , overnight fast examination still remain proposed preparation capsule endoscopy .</detailed_description>
