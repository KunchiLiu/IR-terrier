	<brief_summary>Pneumonia remain important cause morbidity mortality old adult obstructive lung disease . Risk factor pneumonia , include episode associated hospital admission , extensively characterized clinical trial observational study patient COPD , include old age , low predict FEV1 ( &lt; 50 % ) , prior COPD exacerbation , dyspnea , normal low body mass index ( &lt; 25 ) , current smoking certain co-morbid condition ( e.g . dementia ) . The use inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) also identify , associate increase risk pneumonia patient COPD . The primary objective study estimate magnitude know risk factor outcomes pneumonia require hospitalization potential effect modification risk factor ICS use . The primary endpoint severe pneumonia , define community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) result hospitalization and/or death hospital-acquired pneumonia ( HAP ) diagnose two day hospital . As secondary endpoint , CAP result hospitalization death examine . As secondary objective , describe characteristic patient develop pneumonia require hospitalization compare pneumonia require admission . This study use General Practice Online Database ( GOLD ) , formerly refer General Practice research Database ( GPRD ) , primary care electronic medical record database . A new user cohort define among patient COPD 45 year older United Kingdom . Patients consider new user ICS-containing medication receive prescription ICS-containing medication prior year . The comparator treatment group new user long-acting bronchodilator ( LABD ) , include long-acting beta-agonists ( LABA ) long-acting antimuscarinics ( LAMA ) . In one year washout period , new user could either ICS-containing medication LABD . Prior conduct analysis , feasibility analysis conduct evaluate number pneumonia event number new user separately examine available precision base study design . Patients follow date first eligible prescription ( Cohort Entry Date ) early follow : date study end point ( first pneumonia event interest ) , date treatment end ( 60-day gap allow inhaler ) , date transfer new practice , date ICS initiation ( among LABD new user ) , death study end ( end available data ) . As part primary analysis , patient examine first severe pneumonia ( severe CAP , HAP ) . As secondary analysis , time non-severe CAP examine . Incidence rate pneumonia outcomes calculated number patient experience event divide person-years risk . Multivariable analysis perform use Cox proportional hazard model adjustment confounders medication exposure . To adjust difference confound severity due difference prescribe ICS-containing medication LABD , propensity score ( PS ) utilize use inverse probability treatment weighting ( IPTW ) . The propensity score estimate model probability patient receive ICS-containing medication prescription versus receive LABD prescription give patient 's observed set baseline covariates . Effect modification ( statistical interaction ) evaluate base available theory include ICS medication use know risk factor pneumonia ( BMI &lt; 21 , BMI 21-24.9 , BMI ≥25 , age , GOLD stage III/IV , MRC dyspnea score ≥4 , history pneumonia diagnosis , current smoking status , social deprivation quartile ) . Additional interaction may evaluate . To test proportionality hazard function , model diagnostics perform . To compare severe pneumonia non-severe pneumonia patient COPD , characteristic patient experience non-severe CAP vs. severe CAP HAP tabulate . To assess difference treatment , clinical patient characteristic compare use chi-square test Wilcoxon test categorical continuous data , respectively . Severe CAP HAP may combine . Modeling clinical patient characteristic may consider use logistic regression use CAP vs. severe CAP severe CAP vs. HAP . Additional analysis adjustment analytic modeling strategy perform data warrant . A detailed modeling strategy , include generation propensity score Cox modeling , create separate analysis plan . Adjustments priori plan describe final study report .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advantages primary care database include ability link secondary care , Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) , examine risk factor pneumonia include UK Quality Outcomes Framework COPD collect routinely observational healthcare data source ( e.g. , BMI , lung function , smoke history , MRC dyspnea score ) . Another advantage study new-user design , minimize bias cause alternative design compare event prevalent user group ( e.g. , survivor bias , covariates alter prior exposure ) . There also know limitation observational database analyse treatment randomize , include potential confounding severity may fully account analysis . ICS-containing medication may dispense patient severe COPD patient receive long-acting bronchodilator alone . In study , adjust disease severity patient characteristic period prior initiation use propensity score . Medication use CPRD-GOLD base prescribed medication record primary care physician , might dispense pharmacy ultimately utilized patient . Finally , diagnostic practice pneumonia may different UK compare country limit generalizability . As outcome interest , identify pneumonia database imperfect may confusion diagnosis pneumonia influenza serious exacerbation . To knowledge , relationship pneumonia record primary secondary care database investigate . In addition , lack agreement pneumonia classification absence chest x-ray , sputum , etc . Despite limitation , study provide insight risk factor serious pneumonia , include whether ICS modify effect establish risk factor serious pneumonia . The result may identify specific patient group great risk serious pneumonia may identify risk minimization and/or medical recommendation may appropriate .</detailed_description>
