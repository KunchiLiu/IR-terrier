	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Combined With Cord Blood Treatment Graft Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( auto-HSCT ) consider standard care many malignancy , lymphoma , myeloma leukemia , . Graft failure auto-HSCT formidable complication . It occur 2-9.5 % patient associate considerable morbidity mortality relate infection hemorrhagic complication . There various option management graft failure . The common treatment graft failure growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) recombinant erythropoietin , usually effective short term effect platelet count . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) form multipotent adult stem cell isolate bone marrow ( BM ) , adipose tissue , cord blood . Clinical application human MSCs evolve rapidly goal improve hematopoietic engraftment , prevent treat graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on.As important source hematopoietic stem cell , cord blood widely use clinical practice . It report cord blood combine MSCs increase engraftment allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . However , knowledge , report efficacy treatment graft develop auto-HSCT use expanded BM-derived MSCs third-party donor combine cord blood absent.If treatment could show effective safe , BM-derived MSCs could potentially use universal donor material . This would major impact generation donor-specific MSCs time-consuming , costly , often impractical clinical status patient urgent . In present study , investigator prospectively evaluate efficacy safety ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs third-party donor MSCs combine cord blood treat patient graft failure auto-HSCT .</detailed_description>
