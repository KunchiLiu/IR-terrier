	<brief_summary>Open-label , single-arm trial , Primary Objectives include : 1 . To assess immunogenicity TrivivacTM administer healthy infant age 9-14 month . 2 . To assess safety ( reactogenicity ) TrivivacTM administer healthy infant age 9-14 month . The study do healthy infant , 9-14 month age . After enrolment , infant give one dose primary vaccination MMR ( TrivivacTM ) , SEVAPHARMA BiogenetechLtd . study vaccine administer subcutaneously anterolateral aspect right thigh.outer aspect upper arm . Subjects follow approximately 6 week primary vaccination evaluate response primary immunization vaccine . Blood sample collect subject visit 1 ( prior immunization ) visit 2 ( 6 weeksone month completion first dose immunization ) . The serum sample analyse Anti-measles , Anti-mumps Anti-rubella antibody . Proportion subject achieve seroprotection geometric mean titer antibody measles , mumps , rubella 6 week one dose vaccination MMR vaccine age 9-14 month evaluate . Adverse reaction observe vaccination day ( 30 minute ) 4 day ( Day 0-3 ) dose . Adverse reaction also monitor 30 day follow vaccination . Serious adverse event monitor entire study duration .</brief_summary>
