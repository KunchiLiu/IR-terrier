	<brief_summary>The investigator develop new , non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques image small bowel . Building study investigator want study , healthy volunteer , effect stress water content small bowel follow ingestion fructose . This important Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) , seem strong association stress anxiety severity disease . Many IBS patient complain food intolerance recent study suggest food high content fructose worsen symptom IBS . The investigator carry study investigator induce moderate state stress healthy volunteer use injection corticotrophin release hormone , feed drink contain fructose image bowel interval use MRI . Improving understanding effect stress fructose small bowel physiology help u understand good aspect symptom bloat , alter bowel habit abdominal discomfort , experience IBS patient guide therapy . The investigator hypothesize effect CRH cause significant decrease small bowel water content ( SBWC ) faster small bowel transit increase malabsorption follow consumption fructose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A single centre , randomize cross study consist screen visit 2 test day approximately 7 day apart . The participant receive 1g unlabelled lactose ureide glass water 3 time day day study day induce enzyme activity colonic bacteria . The participant ( 20 healthy volunteer ) baseline scan 1.5T MRI scanner small intravenous needle insert forearm . Following procedure , participant another scan give either saline ( 0.9 % NaCl ) 100microgram CRH intravenous injection . 40g fructose 500mg label C-13 lactose ureide dissolve water pure lime juice flavorant make 500mL give participant . They serial scan abdomen 30-60 minute interval 5 hour post prandially . Salivary cortisol collect every MRI scan . Participants also ask blow hydrogen breath machine fill symptom questionnaire follow MRI scan . Further breath collection orocaecal transit time collect initially every 10 minute first hour 15 min end study day . Mouthwash use initial breath test collection . This procedure repeat 2nd test day either saline 100microgram CRH .</detailed_description>
