	<detailed_description>Intralesional Tetracycline Injection Treatment Chalazia Authors : Bryan R. Costin , M.D . Julian D. Perry , M.D . Purpose : To investigate therapeutic role intralesional tetracycline injection compare observation alone treatment chalazia . Introduction : The tetracycline family include tetracycline , doxycycline , minocycline group compound surprising number property include limited antibiotic , anti-malarial , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant . Recent application include us sclerotherapy wide variety condition ganglion cyst lymphangiomas ovarian cyst well reduction hypertrophic scar rabbit models.1,2,3,4 In 2009 , approximately 130 ongoing clinical trial study class drug astound variety condition gingivitis Alzheimer disease brain cancer.5 Chalazia lipogranulomatous inflammatory lesion eyelid one common eyelid lesion extremely frequent present complaint ophthalmologist . Chalazia often represent significant morbidity patient suffer lesion often recurrent , refractory treatment , disfigure . Consequently , chalazia also challenge ophthalmologist . Oral tetracycline show effective treatment ocular rosacea meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) , condition commonly see association chalazia . The anti-inflammatory effect tetracycline think beneficial rosacea drug show alter fatty acid composition lipid layer tear film perhaps explain efficacy MGD.6 Chalazia eventually resolve without intervention , process take many month patient frequently dissatisfied observation treatment modality . Often patient choose incision drainage ( I &amp; D ) lesion method often successful . Another treatment show effective chalazion treatment injection corticosteroid directly lesion , hence provide depot anti-inflammatory effect.7 However , unlike corticosteroid , tetracycline would offer antibiotic , sclerosant , lipid tear film augmentation , addition anti-inflammatory effect . Further , tetracyclines FDA approve treatment acne8 , define inflammation pilosebaceous units9 , chalazia define inflammation sebaceous glands10 . With multiple role mind , propose injection tetracycline chalazia investigate use multipurpose depot . Methods : After IRB approval , chalazia patient wish participate enrolled risk , benefit , alternative , personnel explain informed consent obtain . A total 80 subject randomize one two group : 40 subject observation alone 40 subject treatment intralesional injection 0.05 mL 2 % tetracycline solution . Subjects exclude study le 18 year age , pregnant , chalazia less 1 week duration , know allergy tetracycline derivative , currently take oral tetracycline take past 3 month . Men , post-menopausal woman , woman undergo hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral salpingectomy test pregnancy . Pregnancy test ( urine serum ) perform woman childbearing age enrollment result check prior administration treatment . For patient multiple lesion , either opposite eyelid , symptomatic lesion enrol study . Eyelid margin disease ocular rosacea document time enrollment . Subjects examine 4 week ( +/- 2 week ) post-procedure follow-up visit data regard lesion size , include color photography , lesion regression recurrence , complete ophthalmic examination record . If subject fail follow visit , telephone interview conduct . At time enrollment , subject 's date birth , sex , race/ethnicity , last menstrual period determine well gynecological history determine need pregnancy test . Data collection sheet use record information . Also , previous therapy include topical medication previous surgery review . A millimeter ruler use time enrollment determine size lesion . Lesion photograph also take independent chalazion photograph reviewer able grade degree improvement treatment mask fashion . When procedure perform , variable pain scale use patient document level discomfort injection . At return post procedure visit , lesion re-measured , patient ask grade level improvement follow photograph take use mask grader . All data collection sheet consent store Cleveland Clinic secure location . All study data electronic stored secure Cleveland Clinic server Cleveland Clinic issue encrypted device thumb drive laptop . The occurrence minor adverse unexpected event report principal investigator . Any sentinel event report IRB immediately . A decrease lesion size two-thirds great determine either clinician mask photograph reviewer either group consider improvement see lesion injected tetracycline constitute treatment success .</detailed_description>
