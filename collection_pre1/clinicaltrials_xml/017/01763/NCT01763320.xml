	<brief_summary>Patients symptomatic stenosis intradural artery high risk subsequent stroke . Since SAMMPRIS trial , stenting longer recommended primary treatment , however , result trial , inclusion criterion center selection receive significant criticism appear reflect experience , neither regard natural history , treatment complication rate . As ICAS common cause stroke Asian country , hereby proposing refine prospective randomize multicenter study Asian population strictly define patient participate center inclusion criterion . The China Angioplasty &amp; Stenting Symptomatic Intracranial Severe Stenosis ( CASSISS ) trial , ongoing , government-funded , prospective , multicenter randomize trial . It recruit patient recent TIA stroke cause 70-99 % stenosis major intracranial artery . Patients previous stroke related perforator ischemia include . Only high-volume center prove track record enroll patient determine lead-in phase . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) best medical therapy alone medical therapy plus stenting . Primary endpoint stroke death within 30 day enrollment revascularization procedure qualify lesion follow-up , stroke territory symptomatic intracranial artery beyond 30 day The CASSISS trial conduct 8 site China core imaging lab review North American site aim sample size 380 subject ( stenting , 190 ; medical therapy , 190 ) . Recruitment expect finished Dec , 2016 . Patients follow least three year . The trial schedule complete 2019 . In proposed trial , certain shortcoming SAMMPRIS include patient participate center selection address . The present manuscript outline rationale design study . We estimate trial allow critical reappraisal role intracranial stenting select patient high volume center .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although SAMMPRIS trial impact current treatment intracranial atherosclerotic ( ICAS ) , criticism regard design still raise remain unsettled . In light SAMMPRIS , medical therapy could good ; neither stenting ICAD need abolish , rather role need redefine future prospective trial . Moreover , China develop country , world 's large population . Since 2010 , stroke lead cause death China confers huge burden effort patient health professional . Compared western country , ICAS common vascular lesion patient cerebro-vascular disease , important cause ischemic stroke future recurrent event China . However , treatment strategy long-term result well determine . The health burden China ethnic difference ICAS incidence well willingness continue clinical trial , support need ongoing CASSISS China . Pre-CASSISS registry trial : A registration pilot trial perform prior CASSISS . It aim test credentialing interventionists participate center . From July 2013 Mar 2014 , 12 candidate involve competitive registration study recruit 100 consecutive patient . The patient receive stenting use Wingspan site . As candidate center , follow aspect consider : stenting experience , peri-operative complication , volume stenting case . Those meet follow criterion involve subsequent randomization trial : 1 ) center perform 5 procedure ; 2 ) clinical result demonstrate complication rate 15 % ( stroke death ) . At last , 4 site exclude remain 8 certified invite final randomization trial .</detailed_description>
