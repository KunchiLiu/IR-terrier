	<detailed_description>BetaFat 2-arm , unblinded study compare gastric banding treatment metformin 24-month period moderately obese adult pre- mild type 2 diabetes . The primary outcome change β-cell compensation insulin resistance , investigator compare group . Secondary analysis include potential marker β-cell health potential mediator treatment-specific effect . The main focus mediator related obesity . Clinically , project serve test concept use gastric banding relatively early spectrum obesity β-cell disease . Biologically , result provide crucial information potential mediator β-cell failure arrest reversal context obesity . Those mediator guide development effective treatment monitor β-cell disease cause type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
