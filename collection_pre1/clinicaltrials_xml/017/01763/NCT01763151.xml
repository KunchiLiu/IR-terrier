	<brief_summary>With increase demand patient concern refractive outcome cataract surgery , toric intraocular lens ( IOLs ) correct corneal astigmatism introduce widely cataract surgery . Originally toric IOLs use mainly patient high degree astigmatism , especially corneal surgical procedure penetrate keratoplasty . Since couple year , toric IOLs available numerous manufacturer correct low amount astigmatism much prevalent 30 % corneal astigmatism 0.75D cataract population . This result less spectacle dependence patient due astigmatic correction . The alternative method reduce corneal astigmatism part cataract surgery make incision steep axis cornea limbal relaxing incision additional clear corneal incision opposite ( OCCI ) main cataract opening . These technique use since 2 decade widely use clinical routine . As toric IOLs , precise alignment cut axis astigmatism essential . The disadvantage incisional technique variability effect patient since depends factor extent scar cut surgery well corneal thickness . The main advantage simplicity technique low cost . Aim study compare toric IOL implantation opposite clear corneal incision cataract surgery correct corneal astigmatism .</brief_summary>
