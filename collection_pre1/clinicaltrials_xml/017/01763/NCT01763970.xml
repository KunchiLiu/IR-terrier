	<brief_summary>The SBRT ( stereotactic body radiation therapy ) literature focus clinical outcome adult population . However , SBRT ( stereotactic body radiation therapy ) particularly strong rationale application pediatrics give high biologically effective dos show increase control histology , sarcoma , common pediatrics population ( 11,25 ) . With stereotactic radiation therapy technique , reduction normal tissue dose surround target lesion interest may also accomplish result low toxicity . Given pediatric patient sarcomas , present limited metastasis lung bone , still consider curable population aggressive local therapy , SBRT could significant impact outcome oligometastatic patient may otherwise unresectable ( 25-28 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pediatric patient sarcoma limited metastasis still potentially curable aggressive local therapy . However , conventional moderate dose radiation unlikely provide durable local control . Given recent technologic advance radiation delivery , possible deliver tumoricidal dose , use stereotactic radiation short time course highly focal technique . Stereotactic radiation proven efficacious intracranial set multiple extracranial site adult . It yet well studied pediatrics population particularly strong rationale due ablative dos deliver tumor simultaneously reduce high dose normal tissue . The propose trial single arm phase II study determine efficacy SBRT pediatric sarcoma surgically unresectable metastatic disease . Oligometastatic site eligible treatment study include bony site disease . SBRT deliver eligible site total dose 4000 deliver 5 fraction 800 per fraction day . Following completion SBRT , patient undergo treatment response assessment use diagnostic imaging , clinical examination , completion Brief Pain Inventory ass quality life . The primary objective study determine efficacy SBRT deliver dose 4000 5 fraction 800 patient great 3 year age &lt; 40 year age metastatic disease bone secondary pediatric sarcoma . The secondary objective study include describe toxicity SBRT regimen ; assess clinical response rate target lesion ; assess long-term clinical outcome ; assess quality life follow completion treatment . For patient potentially curable oligometastatic disease , surgical resection conjunction systemic therapy remain standard care . Patients study continue receive chemotherapy outside 2 week window SBRT . Issues may limit participation include inability ass late effect may develop till least 10 year therapy . For reason , limit population study patient surgically unresectable would otherwise incurable current standard systemic therapy .</detailed_description>
