	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Evaluation Pediatric Abdominal Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast enhance ultrasound use clinically Europe past 10 year evaulation tool examine abdominal injury trauma among child adult . This valuable diagnostic modality could potentially reduce need radiation exposure abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) scan trauma evaluation . The research protocol aim compare utility contrast enhance abdominal sonography computerize tomography evaluation child blunt abdominal trauma . Hemodynamically stable child age 7-18 transferred Children 's Hospital trauma service CT scan abdomen &amp; pelvis already perform refer institution identify trauma service eligible inclusion . Children hemodynamically unstable , know cardiac abnormality , unable roll , unable assent exclude study . If child enrol study , he/she non contrast ultrasound , follow contrast enhance ultrasound perform Radiology Department he/she stabilize evaluation complete Emergency Room . The patient vital sign ( include blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation ) monitor study 30 minute contrast administration . The ultrasound perform one two Attending Radiologists involve study . The contrast use study Optison ( GE Healthcare Inc , Princeton , NJ ) , injectable suspension Perflutren Protein-Type A Microspheres . This used echocardiography well abdominal ultrasonography evaluation pediatric abdominal pelvic solid tumor . After non contrast ultrasound perform , Optison contrast agent give via peripheral IV . The contrast enhance ultrasound perform radiologist . Contrast enhancement last 3-5 minute per injection , therefore Optison redo 2 additional dos completion ultrasound . Vital sign monitor 30 minute contrast agent give adverse reaction record . Adverse reaction Optison occur within time frame literature . Subsequent medical care indicate per clinical practice guideline .</detailed_description>
