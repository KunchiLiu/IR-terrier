	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treatment Poor Graft Function After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) cure many hematologic disease . Although good progress make prevention treatment side effect associate transplantation , poor graft function ( PGF ) remain important complication occur 5-27 % patient , associate considerable morbidity mortality relate infection hemorrhagic complication . Treatment PGF usually involve prescription hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , repeat transplantation , method associate short-term effect significant risk graft-versus-host disease（GVHD） development , respectively . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) form multipotent adult stem cell isolate bone marrow ( BM ) , adipose tissue , cord blood . Clinical application human MSCs evolve rapidly goal improve hematopoietic engraftment , prevent treat graft-versus-host disease allo-HSCT . However , efficacy treatment PGF develop allo-HSCT use expanded BM-derived MSCs third-party donor rarely report . If treatment could show effective safe , BM-derived MSCs could potentially use universal donor material . This would major impact generation donor-specific MSCs time-consuming , costly , often impractical clinical status patient urgent . In present study , investigator prospectively evaluate efficacy safety ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs third-party donor treat patient PGF allo-HSCT .</detailed_description>
