	<brief_summary>Nanomedicines currently develop treatment cancer due pharmacological advantage traditional formulation ; provide short infusion time lower risk hypersensitivity reaction associate commonly used solvent . Nab-paclitaxel nanoparticle albumin-bound particle form paclitaxel think exploit natural albumin pathway enhance selective uptake accumulation paclitaxel site tumour , thus reduce diffusion normal tissue . Nab-paclitaxel approve treatment metastatic breast cancer patient fail first-line treatment metastatic disease standard , anthracycline-containing therapy indicate . SPARC cysteine rich acid protein overexpressed broad proportion solid tumour . Expression protein could sensitize tumour cell antitumor activity Nab-paclitaxel , due union albumin-binding protein . First-line clinical trial develop different Nab-paclitaxel regimen also combination different chemotherapy trastuzumab , show high level efficacy . Toxicity profile Nab-paclitaxel well characterize significantly less haematological toxicity compare conventional paclitaxel . Nab-paclitaxel derive grade III neuropathy short-lasting reversible conventional paclitaxel-derived neuropathy , probably due absence Cremophor solvent , due paclitaxel . However still lack clinical physiological characterisation Nab-paclitaxel induce neuropathy . The current used tool early detection continuous evaluation neurotoxicity optimal . Most used toxicity scale limit , provide detailed information severity neuropathy , impact quality life , physiopathology mechanism . In addition , inter-individual variability exist term neurotoxicity predisposition taxanes use ; could relate polymorphic difference gene implicate transport metabolism drug .</brief_summary>
