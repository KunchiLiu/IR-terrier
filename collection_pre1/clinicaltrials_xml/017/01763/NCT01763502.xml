	<brief_summary>Recent evidence show early childhood critical period investment human capital micronutrient deficiency inadequate stimulation major cause impair child development poor country . These finding increase interest promote nutrition intervention preschool participation early childhood . Transfers household link preschool participation potential improve nutrition cognitive outcome young child . Receipt transfer may induce improvement diet quality great preschool participation , enhance nutrition stimulation . However , limited evidence impact program , Latin America . There also evidence relative impact different transfer modality link preschool participation . This study cluster-randomized control evaluation transfer program link preschool participation . The transfer program , administer World Food Programme , provide food cash transfer child age 3-5 year enrol preschools baseline . The preschool , operate Karamoja sub-region Uganda , support UNICEF manage District representative Government Uganda . The food transfer consist multiple-micronutrient-fortified corn soy blend ( CSB ) , oil , sugar , total approximately 1200 calorie per day per child include 99 % iron requirement . Cash transfer equal estimate value food basket purchase market . Randomization food treatment , cash treatment control do across 98 preschool , refer Early Childhood Development ( ECD ) center . The intervention period February 2011 May 2012 include distribution transfer six-to-eight-week cycle . A longitudinal ( panel ) survey households child age 3-5 year baseline conduct exposure transfer 18 month later . The randomized design effectiveness study panel nature data allow rigorous field trial impact nutrition cognitive outcome assess compare across modality . We examine impact two transfer modality , cash transfer multiple-micronutrient-fortified food transfer , link preschool enrollment , child nutrition cognitive development . In addition , explore potential mechanism intermediate impact food intake participation preschool . The key research objective assess follow : 1 . Impacts target group : Assess effect cash food transfer nutrition cognitive outcome child age 3-5 year baseline explore pathways effect . 2 . Optimal program design : Assess differential impact program child provide multiple-micronutrient-fortified food transfer link preschool enrollment compare one give equivalent value cash transfer link preschool enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allocation : Randomized This evaluation conduct community surround Early Childhood Development ( ECD ) center Karamoja sub-region Uganda , Napak , Kotido , Kaabong district . The catchment area ECD center serve cluster randomization analysis . After stratify ECD center ( district Napak Kotido , sub-district spatially-diverse Kaabong ) , cluster assign treatment group ( FOOD , CASH CTRL ) use block randomization , ensure equal distribution ECD center across treatment arm within stratum possible . Block randomization yield 33 ECD center FOOD group , 32 center CASH group , 33 center CTRL group . Subsequently prior start intervention , WFP re-assigned one CTRL center FOOD , due proximity nearby FOOD center , order avoid migration child pose contamination concern . WFP also re-assigned one CASH center FOOD , cash distribution system require use mobile phone , mobile phone signal readily available center 's catchment area . The final assignment include 35 ECD center FOOD group , 31 center CASH group , 32 center CTRL group . Statistical Analysis : - Sample Selection Sample Size : Prior baseline survey , power calculation conduct use exist data Uganda cognitive measure ( Mullens score ) food security measure ( share food expenditure total expenditure ) estimate necessary sample size detect minimum effect size 10 percentage point 80 percent power . These calculation indicate target minimum sample 30 ECD center per treatment arm 20 household per ECD center . 98 ECD center cluster determine eligible transfer receipt WFP . ECD enrollment data collect August-September , 2010 , use identify household child age 3-5 year enrol ECD center . In 98 ECD center , household child age 3-5 year enrol , roughly 25 household select random inclusion baseline sample . - Data Collection : The evaluation use longitudinal design , household interview baseline ( September-November , 2010 , prior start food cash program ) endline ( March-May , 2012 ) . In intervene month , treatment household receive 15 month exposure intervention . Direct assessments child 's cognitive development , anthropometry , hemoglobin level conduct randomly-selected roughly 80 % sample household cluster , due field time constraint . Cognitive development assess use battery test item draw primarily Mullen Scales Early Learning , adapt psychologist Karamoja context . Anthropometry measure follow standard protocol use height board weigh scale . Hemoglobin concentration assess use capillary blood obtain finger prick read use HemoCueÂ® analyzer . Hemoglobin reading adjust necessary effect vary altitude sample . - Analysis : Differences baseline characteristic assess use pairwise t-tests binomial probability test . Analyses impact focus outcome child age 3-5 year ( 36-71 month ) baseline , well child age 36-53 month baseline remain targeted age range throughout course intervention . Intent treat ( ITT ) effect estimate use single-difference ANCOVA specification child baseline endline . Estimates calculate use Stata 12 ; standard error account stratification cluster sample assignment . Ethics Review : - Side Effects : Potential risk participation study low . Many question use survey use Uganda National Household Survey . Cognitive test consist simple game play trained enumerator child unlikely pose risk child . Anthropometry measurement non-invasive also pose risk . Risks associate hemoglobin data collection minimize use well-trained staff , well-designed data collection protocol , safety lancet . The study pose social , emotional , psychological risk subject . - Health provision : If child find severely anemic ( Hb &lt; 7 g/dL ) waste ( weight-for-height less two standard deviation mean ) , child child 's parent notify child refer near clinic medical treatment . - Informed consent : Details study provide verbally local leader LC1 ( roughly equivalent village ) level . The information , include right opt time , provide verbally survey respondent sample household . Additional inform consent sought direct interaction child , include cognitive test , anthropometry , hemoglobin measurement . - IRB : This study underwent internal review International Food Policy Research Institute ; permission conduct data collection grant Uganda National Council Science Technology ( SS 2470 ) . Funding : This evaluation fund World Food Programme , support Spanish government source Strategic Impact Evaluation Trust Fund WFP , United Nations Children 's Fund .</detailed_description>
