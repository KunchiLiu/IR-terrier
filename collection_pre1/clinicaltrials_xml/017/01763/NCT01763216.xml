	<brief_summary>Late-life depression level escalate , include 24 % tenant Assisted Living ( AL ) setting . A promising , novel intervention computerize visual speed process train program know Road Tour . Road Tour show reduce depressive symptom level risk onset clinical depression community dwell old adult . The investigator hypothesize similar benefit accrue resident AL setting . To evaluate investigator use two-arm , parallel , randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare Road Tour train attention control use computerized crossword puzzle among 370 adult 55 year old old reside 15-30 AL setting partner investigator . The investigator hypothesize Road Tour participant improve cognitive processing speed , low level depressive symptom , low likelihood onset clinical depression , less anxiety , low level pain symptom , good health-related quality life . These outcome assess baseline , post-training , six month , one year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Late-life depression large , escalate public health problem often interact health condition lead spiral disability simultaneously threaten independence health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) , increase health care cost . Depression affect 24 % old adult AL setting , rate recognition treatment low underscore need alternative depression prevention treatment method AL . A novel promising intervention computerize cognitive training program know Road Tour , show serendipitous benefit reduce depression symptom onset suspected clinical depression consistent Beck 's model cognitive depression . As self-directed , user-friendly `` game '' , Road Tour overcome common attitudinal resource-related barrier impede treatment AL setting , hold considerable promise interrupt potential downward spiral depression-related disability 1 million AL elder . The purpose study evaluate effect Road Tour process speed , depressive symptom suspect clinical depression , depression-related comorbidities among AL resident Iowa . The investigator use two-arm , parallel , RCT compare Road Tour train attention control use computerized crossword puzzle among 370 adult 55 year old old . The investigator actively engage 15-30 AL setting associate facility study partner implement train site assist evaluation process . The investigator help AL set develop AL-specific recruitment enrollment protocol , educate AL staff study , oversee computerized training participate resident , well family member AL staff . The investigator ' three specific aim : ( 1 ) establish effect Road Tour improve cognitive processing speed AL ; ( 2 ) evaluate effect Road Tour reduce depressive symptom risk onset suspect clinical depression AL ; , ( 3 ) evaluate effect Road Tour depression-related health outcome anxiety , pain , HRQoL AL . Participants receive 10 hour computerized train 5-6 week , 4 hour booster train month 5 11 , total 18 hour train . Outcomes change Useful Field View ( UFOV ) test speed processing ( Aim 1 ) , change 12-item Centers Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ( CESD-12 ) 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) depressive symptom suspect clinical depression ( Aim 2 ) , change Short Form 36-item Health-Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) Questionnaire ( SF-36 ) HRQoL , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) pain , 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire ( GAD-7 ) anxiety ( Aim 3 ) . Data collect use telephone interview baseline , post-training ( 6-8 week ) , 26-weeks 52-weeks . Linear mixed effect model adjust cluster within AL setting use main effect specify treatment group time , well two-way interaction . This study first step evaluate depression-related outcome use Road Tour AL setting .</detailed_description>
