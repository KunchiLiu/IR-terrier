	<brief_title>The Influence Febuxostat Coronary Artery Endothelial Dysfunction Participants With Chronic Stable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call febuxostat . Febuxostat test treat people angina . This study look heart blood flow people take febuxostat . The study enroll approximately 30 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment group ( sequence ) —which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Sequence 1 : 6 week febuxostat follow 6 week placebo . - Sequence 2 : 6 week placebo follow 6 week febuxostat All participant ask take one capsule time day throughout study . All participant ask record time angina symptom study . This single-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 16 week . Participants make 7 visit clinic include final visit 4 week last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
