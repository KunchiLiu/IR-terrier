	<brief_summary>In study investigate efficacy safety infiltration vestibulum vagina botulin toxin woman diagnose localized provoke vulvodynia . In literature cover subject find prevalence condition 10 15 % . Especially young , sexually active woman suffer problem capable sexual relation partner burn pain . The probable explanation physiopathological mechanism increase nerve ending epithelium vestibulum , increase activation pain receptor vestibular mucosa . It also seem patient vestibulodynia high tonus pelvic floor muscle , great muscle contraction response pain low capacity relaxation . Botulin toxin ( Botox ) neurotoxin cause temporary paralysis muscle cell . That way decrease increase tension pelvic floor muscle Botox also inhibit pain receptor vestibulum . Patients recruit gynecology consultation . Every patient localize provoke vulvodynia try previous treatment ( pelvic floor muscle therapy , antidepressant , anti-epileptics , local anesthetic ) undergo Q-tip testing . If positive underlying disease , patient invite participate study oral write informed consent , include study population . Every 6 week give injection 50 unit botulin toxin , 6 different spot vestibulum . 50 % subject receive physiological water instead Botox ( control population ) . After 3 session , assess difference provoke pain treated patient vs. placebos Q-tip testing .</brief_summary>
