	<brief_summary>Background : - Hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin ( HPBCD ) test disease call Niemann-Pick disease type C1 ( NPC1 ) . NPC1 genetic disorder result gradual loss nervous system function . Cholesterol fat trouble move brain cell , make cell work poorly lead symptom . There treatment currently approve US NPC1 . Researchers want test safe use HPBCD NPC1 . They want see help brain cell process cholesterol well . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness HPBCD NPC1 . Eligibility : - Individuals 2 25 year age diagnose NPC1 already receive HPBCD attempt treat NPC1 . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They provide blood urine sample screen . They also neurological test , include test hearing , speech movement . - Participants lumbar puncture ( also call spinal tap ) every month deliver drug spinal fluid surround brain . The length trial determine safety efficacy information obtain . - Treatment monitor frequent blood urine test , cerebral spinal fluid test , hear neurological exam .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Niemann-Pick disease type C ( NPC ) lethal , autosomal recessive , lysosomal storage disorder characterize neurodegeneration early childhood death adolescence . The causative gene NPC1 ( 95 % case ) NPC2 ( 5 % case ) involve intracellular trafficking lipid cholesterol . Mutations either gene lead progressive accumulation unesterified cholesterol lipid central nervous system ( CNS ) . The National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Therapeutics Rare Neglected Diseases ( TRND ) program develop 2-hydroxypropyl-Beta-cyclodextrin ( HP-Beta-CD ) treatment patient Niemann-Pick disease type C1 ( NPC1 ) slow progression symptom disease . In Phase 1 , non-randomized , open-label , single-center , study , propose administer HP-Beta-CD intrathecally via lumbar injection drug naive cohort 3 patient dose 200 mg escalate 300 , 400 mg 900 mg . Subsequent dose escalation may occur increment 300 mg . The objective study assess safety , tolerability , feasibility , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) intrathecally ( IT ) administer HP-Beta-CD NPC1 patient , determine active dose HP-Beta-CD measure change plasma 24- ( S ) hydroxycholesterol ( 24 ( S ) -HC ) concentration , evaluate use biomarkers potential clinical outcome NPC1 . All patient cohort receive HP-Beta-CD ( n = 3 ) monthly least two dos , decision dose-escalate base safety biochemical data . Safety assess adverse event ( AEs ) , audiologic evaluation , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination , chest X-rays electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) . Biochemical efficacy measure change baseline plasma 24 ( S ) -HC . PK assess plasma HP-Beta-CD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Aged great equal 2 less equal 25 year old time enrollment , either gender ethnicity . 2 . Diagnosis NPC1 base upon one following : 1 . Two NPC1 mutation ; 2 . Positive filipin stain least one NPC1 mutation ; 3 . Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy ( VSNGP ) combination either : . One NPC1 mutation , ii . Positive filipin stain NiemannPick Type 2 ( NPC2 ) mutation . 3 . Patients least one neurological manifestation NPC1 . For example , limit , hear loss , vertical supranuclear gaze palsy , ataxia , dementia , dystonia , seizure , dysarthria , dysphagia . 4 . Ability travel National Institutes Health Clinical Center ( NIH CC ) repeatedly evaluation followup . 5 . If take miglustat , patient must take constant dose medication le 3 month prior baseline evaluation must willing maintain dose level duration trial . 6 . Willing discontinue nonprescription supplement , exception ageappropriate multivitamin . 7 . Women reproductive age must willing use effective method contraception duration trial . 8 . Willing participate aspect trial design include serial blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) collection . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Aged 2 25 year age enrollment trial . 2 . Subjects exclude weight would result endotoxin level would exceed 0.2 EU/kg either saline drug dosing . 3 . Severe manifestation NPC1 would interfere patient 's ability comply requirement protocol . 4 . Neurologically asymptomatic patient . 5 . Patients receive form cyclodextrin attempt treat NPC1 . Treatment another drug preparation another medical indication contains cyclodextrin excipient , exclude patient . 6 . History hypersensitivity reaction cyclodextrin component formulation . 7 . Pregnancy breastfeed time study . 8 . Patients suspected infection CNS systemic infection . 9 . Spinal deformity would impact ability perform lumbar puncture 10 . Skin infection lumbar region 11 . Neutropenia , define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) less 1,500 . 12 . Thrombocytopenia ( platelet count le 75,000 per cubic millimeter ) . 13 . Evidence disturb circulation CSF . 14 . Contraindication anesthesia . 15 . Prior use anticoagulant history/presence bleed disorder increase risk clinical bleed international normalize ratio ( INR ) great 2 . 16 . Patients clinical evidence acute liver disease symptom jaundice right upper quadrant pain . 17 . Presence anemia define two standard deviation normal age gender . 18 . For subject 18 year age old , epidermal growth factor receptor ( eGFR ) automatically calculate report NIH CC laboratory utilize Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKDEPI ) Creatinine 2009 equation . We exclude subject great equal 18 year age eGFR less equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 . For subject &lt; 18 12 year age , utilize national kidney disease education program ( NKDEP ) calculator ( http : //www.nkdep.nih.gov/labevaluation/gfrcalculators/childrenconventionalunit.shtml ) . Results report &gt; 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 lower . We exclude subject &lt; 18 year age eGFR less equal 75 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 19 . Hematuria single urinalysis , define American Urological Association ( AUA ) five red blood cell per highpower field ( &gt; 25/micro L ) microscopic evaluation urinary sediment properly collect urinalysis specimen . The patient exclude 2 subsequent urine specimen negative hematuria define AUA . 20 . Proteinuria ( 1+ protein urinalysis ) unless evaluate classified benign patient primary medical provider NIH nephrology consult context normal urine protein creatinine ratio absence clinical symptom ( edema , hypertension ) . 21 . Active pulmonary disease , oxygen requirement clinically significant history decrease blood oxygen saturation , pulmonary therapy , require active suction . 22 . Patients unable complete behavioral audiologic evaluation include puretone threshold assessment ( 500 Hz 8000 Hz ) monitor ototoxicity otoacoustic emission ( OAEs ) reliably obtain baseline . 23 .
