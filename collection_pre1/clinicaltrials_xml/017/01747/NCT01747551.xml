	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug Ziv-aflibercept combination mFOLFOX6 compare mFOLFOX6 alone . The drug use mFOLFOX6 include Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , Leucovorin Oxaliplatin . In patient esophagogastric cancer , mFOLFOX6 use clinical trial standard care . `` Investigational '' mean FDA yet approve combination treatment esophagogastric cancer . Every person molecule bloodstream call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFs ) . These molecule help grow sustain new blood vessel need human body . Cancer tumor hijack mechanism need new blood vessel oxygen grow . Ziv-aflibercept antibody , `` target therapy '' call `` VEGF Trap '' , `` trap '' ( bind ) VEGFs prevents cancer use grow . Ziv-aflibercept recently approve FDA patient treatment-resistant colorectal cancer . Patients receive standard 5-fluoruracil base chemotherapy pus ziv-aflibercept live significantly long patient receive standard 5-fluoruracil alone . In research study , investigator see add ziv-aflibercept standard chemotherapy ( mFOLFOX6 ) work well mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy alone patient metastatic unresectable esophagogastric cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient agree participate research study , ask undergo screening test procedure find eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn patient take part research study . If patient test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , physical examination , EKG , CT , Blood test , pregnancy test , urine test , additional blood test research collection archival tumor tissue . The screening test review doctor study team patient meet eligibility criterion study , begin treatment . If patient meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study , `` randomize '' one two group . A participant receive either : mFOLFOX6 Ziv-aflibercept -or- mFOLFOX6 Placebo ( A Placebo contain medicine ) Randomization mean participant put group chance ( like flip coin ) . Neither participant research doctor choose group participant . Randomization 2:1 ( twice many participant study receive mFOLFOX6+Ziv-aflibercept ) . This study `` blind '' , mean neither patient doctor know patient get investigational drug placebo mFOLFOX6 . Before participant begin mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy , central venous line insert intravenous ( vein ) chemotherapy administration . This call `` port '' vascular access device . Insertion port minor outpatient surgical procedure perform surgeon interventional radiologist depend do . The doctor arrange participant procedure do participant begin . mFOLFOX6 combination chemotherapy include oxaliplatin , leucovorin , 5-FU . The oxaliplatin leucovorin give intravenously 2 hour . The 5-FU also give intravenously . The participant get shot 5-FU infusion nurse hook portable pump infuse rest 5-FU slowly next 46-48 hour . The participant either disconnect pump home , return infusion unit disconnect . The participant , caregiver nurse discus best option disconnect pump patient receive instruction home , applicable . Ziv-aflibercept/Placebo give 1 hour intravenously .</detailed_description>
