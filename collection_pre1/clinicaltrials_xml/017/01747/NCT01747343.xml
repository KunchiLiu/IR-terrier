	<brief_summary>The investigator interested determine procedure prove efficient effective facilitating continence ( i.e. , `` dry pant '' absence soil undergarment ) , appropriate elimination ( i.e. , voids/stools toilet ) , independent requests/initiations use toilet . To assess effectiveness toilet training method ( procedure ) , data toileting skill ( addition skill give child 's curriculum ) collect across school day ( 7:30 am-5:45 pm ) classroom teacher . The primary dependent variable ( toileting skill ) continence ( i.e. , absence soil undergarment ) , appropriate elimination ( i.e. , number voids/stools make toilet ) , independent/self request ( i.e. , communication child adult use toilet ) . The toileting procedure implement classroom teacher ( undergraduate practicum student ) implementation monitor classroom supervisor ( graduate teaching assistant ) . Procedural effectiveness evaluate daily basis graduate teach assistant at-least-weekly basis faculty supervisor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>First , effect baseline toileting program assess . Baseline consist prompt child use bathroom approximately every 90 min ( frequently independently request ) . If investigator observe low level continence , appropriate elimination , and/or independent/self request , component program systematically alter increase success . The ultimate goal child remain continent throughout day , independently request ( initiate ) toilet use , appropriately eliminate toilet bathroom . The following procedural modification make high level success observe baseline : The first modification change child 's undergarment type . Specifically , underwear use , 's effect evaluate determine effect ( ) underwear toileting performance . The second modification conduct individualize preference assessment identify type food leisure item give child prefers . This do child select item array ( item select base direct observation child parent/teacher report ) allow him/her access choose item brief period time . This generate list preferred items/activities rank order relative preference . Subsequently , high ranked item preference assessment arrange reinforcer continence , appropriate elimination , self-initiations . A third modification combine modification determine whether combination toilet training procedure enhance toileting performance ( compare implementation individual toilet training procedure ) . This modification conduct child wear underwear .</detailed_description>
