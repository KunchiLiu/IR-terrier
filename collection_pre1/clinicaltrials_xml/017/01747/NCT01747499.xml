	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion within 30 day prior Day 0 unless otherwise note . Phase I : Diagnosis hematological malignancy list ( exclude myelofibrosis ) remission stable minimal residual disease Acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) 1st subsequent remission relapse remission Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) 1st subsequent remission relapse remission Myelodysplastic syndrome either intermediate 1 2 , high risk International Prognostic Scoring System Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) accelerate second chronic phase NonHodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) 2nd great complete remission , partial remission , refractory relapse Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , Rai Stage 24 , fail least 2 prior regimen Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , Stage 23 Myeloproliferative disorder neoplasm Phase II : Diagnosis AML remission 1 2 diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome either intermediate 1 2 , high risk International Prognostic Scoring System . Patients MDS must transplant candidate current clinical standard . Patients treat hypomethylating agent prior enter study eligible . Must match unrelated donor ( 8 8 HLA match A , B , C , DR locus ) high resolution DNA typing Must donor peripheral blood stem cell mobilize NMDP standard . No bone marrow donor . Must 28 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg ( recipient weight ) infuse Day 0 . Must least one additional aliquot &gt; =1 x 10^6 CD34/kg cryopreserved cell stored time transplant . Must receive myeloablative reduce intensity condition regimen SCT define CIBMTR Cyclophosphamide single dose total body irradiation Fludarabine busulfan Fractionated TBI cyclophosphamide Busulfan cyclophosphamide Must able receive GVHD prophylaxis tacrolimus methotrexate . Must ≥ 18 yr old ≤ 70 yr old . Azacitidine approve FDA use child . Must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . Must laboratory result indicate : Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl , unless diagnosis Gilbert 's disease AST/ALT ≤ 3 X upper limit institutional normal Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl Patient must ability understand willingness provide write informed consent prior participation study relate procedure perform . The effect azacitidine develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason category D agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing age must negative serum pregnancy test ( ßhuman chorionic gonadotropin ) within 72 hour prior initiate condition regimen willing become pregnant use effective contraception undergo treatment least 3 month last dose azacitidine . Men must willing father new child receive therapy . They must use effective barrier method contraception study 3 month follow last dose . Must myelofibrosis disease know prolong neutrophil engraftment &gt; 28 day transplant . Must receive investigational agent within 14 day first dose azacitidine ( Day 7 ) . Must myeloablative conditioning define : TBI &lt; = Gy +/ purine analog Flu + Cy +/ ATG Flu + AraC + Ida Cladribine + AraC Total Lymphoid Irradiation + ATG Must receive antithymocyte globulin part pretransplant conditioning regimen . Antithymocyte globulin exclude due potential impact modulate incidence GvHD GvL . Must uncontrolled intercurrent illness include ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Must pregnant breastfeeding . Pregnant woman exclude study azacitidine Category D agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother azacitidine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated azacitidine . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Must know suspected hypersensitivity azacitidine , mannitol , compound similar composition azacitidine.. Must advance malignant hepatic tumor . Must HIV , HBV , HCV positive .</criteria>
