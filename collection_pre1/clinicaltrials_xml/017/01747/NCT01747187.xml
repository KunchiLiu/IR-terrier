	<brief_summary>Septic shock major cause death intensive care . Septic shock often dominate profound change organ function , cardiac failure one severe . In septic shock , biological marker cardiac stress often elevate . It known extent indicate structural damage heart , way correlate echocardiographic sign heart failure . Here , cardiac failure ICU patient septic shock study , use biological marker cardiac stress , inflammatory parameter echocardiography . Investigators hypothesize biomarkers cardiac stress correlate echocardiographic sign heart failure , predict increase risk death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sepsis septic shock major health concern worldwide . Sepsis consequence inflammatory process humoral cellular reaction severe infection . Its clinical presentation variable , continuum systemic response infection fulminant disease refractory resuscitation multiple organ failure . Septic shock severe form sepsis lead cause death intensive care patient high mortality despite modern resuscitation treatment . Septic shock dominate clinically circulatory change present profound vasodilatation hypotension . Cardiac output value often seemingly normal , even enhance , compare physiological range . However , relative vasodilatation , cardiac output often adequately enhance . Thus , degree myocardial depression sepsis often underestimated clinician , albeit factor markedly increase mortality . Septic cardiomyopathy typically engage ventricle globally , involve diminished cardiac response volume circulate catecholamine . It primarily hypoxic , rather multifactorial origin . In survivor , typically reversible , long-term consequence know . Cardiac biomarkers , i.e . troponins natriuretic peptide , associate bad outcome septic shock . Cardiac troponins frequently elevate correlate duration hypotension intensity vasopressor support . Elevated natriuretic peptide predict adverse outcome , value often markedly elevate even seemingly normal echocardiographic finding . It clear whether indicate structural myocardial damage , rather demonstrate global septic membrane leakage . Thus , complexity sepsis , combination cardiac biomarkers marker global inflammation may provide robust tool stratification prognostication evaluation septic organ dysfunction . In clinical cardiology , combination biomarkers myocardial stress use stratification prognostication myocardial failure , role multimarker panel septic cardiomyopathy study . Echocardiography use clinically , focus several study , characterize septic cardiomyopathy . Echocardiographic sign systolic dysfunction main focus previous investigation , systolic component focus modern guideline clinical management septic cardiomyopathy . The role diastolic dysfunction gain interest , data suggest high mortality patient diastolic dysfunction systolic dysfunction . To date , correlation echocardiographic sign systolic diastolic dysfunction myocardial stress biomarker panel , dynamic correlation , study . The hypothesis study biological marker cardiac stress correlate echocardiographic sign cardiac failure , predict outcome , correlate conventional method outcome prediction .</detailed_description>
