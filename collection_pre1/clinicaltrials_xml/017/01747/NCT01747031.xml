	<detailed_description>Noninvasive fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) compute CT ( FFRCT ) novel method determine physiologic significance coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , several clinical trial reveal FFRCT good correlation invasive FFR , also use noninvasive FFRCT plus Computed Tomography ( CT ) among stable patient suspect known CAD associate improved diagnostic accuracy discrimination v CT alone diagnosis hemodynamically significant CAD . The cornerstone FFR linear relationship pressure flow condition constant ( minimize ) intracoronary resistance , FFRCT . Under condition , pressure flow assume directly proportional , decrease pressure across stenosis reflect decrease blood flow dependent myocardium . However , even administration potent pharmacologic agent adenosine , intracoronary resistance static , instead fluctuate phasic pattern throughout cardiac cycle . In addition , patient allergic pharmacologic agent sever lesion response little pharmacologic agent , measurement FFR challenge lesion always underestimate . The ADVISE trial reveal intracoronary resistance naturally constant minimize wave-free period . The instantaneous wave-free ratio calculate period produce drug-free index stenosis severity comparable FFR . But whether iFR calculate Computed Tomography ( iFRCT ) comparable FFRCT FFR , diagnostic performance remain unknown . Thus investigator conduct trial ass diagnostic performance Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio diagnosis hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis . Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio calculate reconstructed heart model.Wave-intensity analysis identify wave-free period intracoronary resistance rest similar variability magnitude.The investigator define rest distal-to-proximal pressure ratio period instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR ) .</detailed_description>
