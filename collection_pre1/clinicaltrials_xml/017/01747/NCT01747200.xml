	<brief_summary>Background : - The brain natural rhythm call brain wave . An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) record rhythm . When people identify picture familiar object show computer screen , communication certain region brain increase . An EEG detect communication brain wave . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) affect brain wave slightly change brain rhythm . Researchers want see change brain rhythm TMS interfere ability identify picture familiar object . This study provide information TMS affect brain wave behavior . Objectives : - To see TMS interfere brain ability identify picture familiar object . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 70 year age . Design : - This study require two visit clinical center . The first visit last 2 hour . The second visit last 4 hour . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - At first visit , participant object recognition test . Participants look picture several object computer screen . They state whether object see screen familiar . The object recognition test do along TMS . - At second visit , participant EEG take object recognition test . Brain wave monitor test . They repeat test repetitive TMS study effect object recognition . The participant take object recognition test alone final time . This make sure TMS effect ( ) ability identify familiar object image longer present .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inter-hemispheric coherence ( IHC ) one electroencephalography ( EEG ) parameter measure synchronization oscillation originate brain region different hemisphere thereby functional connectivity . We know object discrimination associate transient increase IHC . In study interfere transient IHC associate midline object discrimination use rhythmic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . We study effect entrainment unilateral bilateral , synchronous asynchronous TMS pulse behavior . The goal study determine entrainment TMS affect task performance . If result show TMS entrainment influence behavior , expect TMS useful technique explore behavioral impact specific neuronal oscillation physiological well pathological condition . Further , TMS could also find application rehabilitation treatment behavioral symptom patient neuropsychiatric disease . STUDY POPULATION : We intend study 11 adult healthy volunteer outpatient basis . STUDY DESIGN : All subject first participate screen session threshold TMS intensity block object discrimination optimal coil orientation determine use single pulse TMS . Later attend main experiment session ask perform object discrimination task four block , second , third fourth random order . During first block , individual coherence frequency determine record EEG task . During second , third fourth block , subject receive either unilateral , bilateral sham rTMS random order EEG record . Short train 7 TMS pulse deliver trial . TMS pulse administer leave and/or right LOG 80 % threshold intensity block object discrimination 60 % maximum stimulator output whichever small . OUTCOME MEASURES : We expect short train TMS affect IHC depend whether pulse synchronous asynchronous . By modulate IHC , expect change object discrimination task performance . The primary outcome measure study include object discrimination task performance . During study , also compute individual frequency maximum coherence occurs , threshold intensity optimal coil direction block object discrimination spatio-temporal characteristic EEG wave rTMS train confirm entrainment occurring .</detailed_description>
