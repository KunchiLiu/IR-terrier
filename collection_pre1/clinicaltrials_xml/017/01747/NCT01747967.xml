	<brief_summary>There currently image technique allow directly visualize measure pancreatic beta-cell mass . Consequently , best parameter estimate mass insulin ( C-peptide byproduct ) residual beta cell able produce . This insulin secretion measure meal test , different time drink standardized quantity nutrient . However , test cumbersome ( last 3 h , blood sample take every 30 minute ) hold poor sensitivity , probably insufficient detect residual beta cell . Nevertheless , residual cell improve glycemic control instrumental clinical efficacy immune and/or regenerative therapy . We hypothesize residual beta cell may represent remain insulin secretory capacity , also antigenic load capable stimulate beta-cell-reactive T lymphocytes . The disappearance T lymphocytes circulate blood time may thus correlate beta-cell loss . Measuring beta-cell-reactive T-cell response may therefore provide simple sensitive immune surrogate marker residual insulin secretion . Other surrogate marker may obtain measure urinary C peptide residual secretion counter-regulatory hormone glucagon . The main objective study : 1 . To evaluate correlation beta-cell-reactive T-cell response residual insulin secretion . 2 . To evaluate correlation residual insulin secretion measure serum C peptide urinary C peptide . 3 . To evaluate correlation residual insulin glucagon secretion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Biomarkers Residual Beta-cell Mass Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) display average 4 % annual increase incidence Western country , particularly child young adult . As require life-long treatment carry significant risk hypoglycemic long-term micro- macrovascular complication , lead cause disability public health expenditure . T1D autoimmune disease comprise humoral response ( antibody-producing B lymphocyte ) cellular response ( T lymphocytes ) . However , antibody merely disease marker play major pathogenic role . Rather , T1D cause abnormal recognition beta-cell epitope T lymphocytes . This recognition lead destruction pancreatic insulin-secreting beta cell , hence need lifelong insulin treatment . However , beta-cell destruction rarely complete time T1D onset . The hypothesis test residual beta-cell mass may represent endogenous insulin secretory capacity , also antigenic load capable maintain activation autoreactive T lymphocyte . In word , disappearance beta-cell-reactive T-cell response time may correlate beta-cell loss . Measurement T-cell response may thus provide surrogate immune marker residual beta cell . The primary objective evaluate correlation residual insulin secretion T-cell response direct beta-cell antigen . The secondary objective evaluate correlation residual insulin secretion estimate serum urine C-peptide measurement ; evaluate correlation residual insulin glucagon secretion . The ImMaDiab study cohort-based investigation blood sample collection . Both new-onset T1D child adults recruit . Insulin secretion stimulate standardized meal test . Following T1D diagnosis , blood urine sample collect every 6 month 30 month order measure serum urine C peptide , glucagon T-lymphocyte response select beta-cell antigen .</detailed_description>
