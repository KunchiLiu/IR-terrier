	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis disease characterize increase bone fragility deteriorate bone micro-architecture . The main consequence osteoporosis low-trauma fracture , often hip , spine wrist . Recently , another type low-trauma fracture , atypical femur fracture ( AFFs ) , receive much attention . Little known cause debilitating fracture ; however , associate long term bisphosphonate use . What currently know AFFs base case report small case series , study use administrative database secondary analysis bisphosphonate trial . While report provide preliminary information relationship long term bisphosphonate exposure AFFs , detailed clinical data absent . As establish network specialist across southern Ontario group position collect meaningful information large group patient experience debilitate fracture centralize AFF registry .</brief_summary>
