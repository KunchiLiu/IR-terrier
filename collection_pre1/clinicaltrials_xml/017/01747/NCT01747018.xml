	<brief_summary>Platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) use alternative non-operative treatment increase rate cure bone soft-tissue regeneration , although clinical study regard treatment articular cartilage damage . Therefore , study propose non-surgical intervention patient articular cartilage damage experience knee pain cause damage . This study conduct single medical center . It uncontrolled , prospective clinical trial , study subject include 44 patient suffer early osteoarthritis degenerative chondropathy ; 18 65 year age include study irregardless sex . PRP inject twice intraarticulary within interval four week . The pain score functional score compare two month , four month , six month follow second injection complete , use VAS , Lysholm knee scale , Cincinnati knee rating system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients 18 65 year age early osteoarthritis degenerative chondropathy previously take medication six month without physical improvement , assess open clinical trial . The 44 patient meet experiment criterion voluntarily give write consent PRP treatment , finally select . The knee joint stable without severe deformity great 5 degree valgus varus . The exclusion criterion include advanced osteoarthritis ( Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale &gt; 2 ) inflammatory arthritis severe deformity exceed range . Patellofemoral instability , history drug abuse , and/or psychological problem also patient exclusion criterion . In addition , patient positive HIV , HBV , HCV , HTLV , CMV , EBV , Syphilis test , severe anemia , severe heart disease history cardiac surgery , active tuberculosis , pneumonia , pregnant woman woman plan pregnancy within six month , woman breast-feeding , patient history drug abuse within past six month , patient uncontrolled infection , take anti-inflammatory drug within past five day , patient judge inappropriate participate clinical trial doctor experiment due psychiatric problem , exclude study . A total 44 patient receive treatment , 19 male patient ( 43 % ) 25 female patient ( 57 % ) . The mean age study subject 43 year ( range : 19-63 year old ) , mean BMI 24.9 ( 20.1-31.2 ) . Fifteen leave knee pain , five right knee pain , 14 pain knee . This clinical study accord 'ethical principle medical research human being ' base declaration Helsinki Korean good clinical practice standard ( GCP , The Ministry Food Drug Administration 2009-211 ) conduct review Institutional review board ( Catholic University Korea ) . Blood sample collection PRP production From patient participate clinical trial , 27 ml blood sample collect 20-G needle antecubital vein ratio blood anti-coagulant become 10:1 . The collected blood sample transfer prepared separation kit ( Prosys PRP , Seoul , Korea ) underwent centrifugation speed 3,000 RPM three minute . The buffy coat layer plasma upper portion layer obtain transfer concentration kit ( Prosys PRP , Seoul , Korea ) use 10-ml syringe . They underwent centrifugation speed 3,300 RPM three minute order obtain concentrated PRP . PRP injection The injection area sterilize aseptically 3-4 cc PRP percutaneously inject knee joint . The patient ask keep bending stretch inject knee several time PRP could evenly spread . If intra-articular effusion identify , remove PRP injection . The patient advise rest 24 hour move affect knee aggressive manner . Follow-up PRP injection The study subject follow instruction give doctor experiment second PRP injection administer four week first injection . The pain score functional score measure two month , four month , six month second injection use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , Cincinnati knee rating system ( CKRS ) , Lysholm knee scale ( LKS ) . The clinical score calculate determine time evaluation level 1 ( injection ) , level 2 ( second injection ) , level 3 ( two month second injection ) , level 4 ( four month second injection ) , level 5 ( six month second injection ) . Evaluation method statistics The measurement score system describe average standard deviation order examine effect PRP pain cause intra-articular cartilage injury , SPSS ( version 12.0 ) use statistical analysis . The Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , Lysholm Knee Scale , Cincinnati Knee Rating System test use Repeated Measure ANOVA consider significant p value less 0.05 . The effect scale ( ES ) , probability type 1 error ( α ) statistical power analysis determine ES= .50 , α= .05 , ( 1-β ) = .90 selection study subject , G-Power 3.0.10 use .</detailed_description>
