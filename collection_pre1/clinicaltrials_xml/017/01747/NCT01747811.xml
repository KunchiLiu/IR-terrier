	<brief_summary>Mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) `` concussion '' increasingly prevalent injury society . Patients post-concussion syndrome show deficit test short term memory , divide attention , multi-tasking , information processing speed , reaction time , well alteration mood emotional functioning . Many patient vague complaint include fatigue , dizziness , irritability , sleep disturbance , chronic headache . Furthermore , sleep disruption one common complaint patient suffer traumatic brain injury , many 40 65 % patient mTBI complain insomnia . Sleep problem patient associated poor outcome , resolution sleep disturbance associate improvement cognitive functioning . Despite recent evidence correlation sleep quality recovery traumatic brain injury , well-established role sleep neural plasticity neurogenesis , virtually direct study causal effect sleep recovery follow mTBI . However , quite likely sleep play critical role recovery follow brain injury . A particularly promising non-pharmacologic approach show potential improving/modifying abnormality circadian rhythm sleep-wake schedule bright light therapy . For proposed investigation , hypothesize bright light therapy may helpful improve sleep patient recent history mTBI may also mood elevate effect , promote positive treatment outcome individual . Bright light therapy may increase likelihood recover quickly , benefit extensively forms therapy , build emotional cognitive resilience .</brief_summary>
