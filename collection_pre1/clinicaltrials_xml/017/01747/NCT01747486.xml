	<detailed_description>This study conduct determine optimal dose autologous CART-19 T cell engineer express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor patient relapse refractory CD19 positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . The two dose level assess 1-5x10e8 versus 1-5x10e7 . The trial conduct two stage . In stage I subject randomize one two dose cohort a1:1 ratio total 12 subject per dose cohort . Stage II enroll additional 8 subject select dose cohort safety , tolerability clinical response evaluate determine optimal dose cohort .</detailed_description>
