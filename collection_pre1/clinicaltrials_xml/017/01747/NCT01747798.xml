	<brief_title>Auranofin Treating Patients With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate feasibility conduct 10-patient pilot study asymptomatic ovarian cancer patient cancer antigen ( CA 125 ) elevation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether oral gold therapy either stabilizes lower CA 125 level maintains patient asymptomatic state provide descriptive data tumor response duration response . II . To acquire qualitative data patient ' perception learn CA 125 elevation . III . To explore whether immunohistochemical stain PKC iota expression resect tumor sample appear associated clinical outcome auranofin . OUTLINE : Patients receive auranofin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
