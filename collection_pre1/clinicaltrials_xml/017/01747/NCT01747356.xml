	<brief_summary>Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent ( ZES ) system ( Medtronic , USA ) world-wildly used treat patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The State Food Drug Administration China approve qualification RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent system 2010 . It report RESOLUTE stent may suitable DM patient FDA approve diabetic coronary lesion indication use Resolute stent . Here investigator set multicenter , non-inferiority study : efficacy safety RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent treatment Chinese diabetes ( RESOLUTE-DIABETES CHINA ) purpose identify efficacy safety Asia CAD correlate diabetic population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety RESOLUTE Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent Treatment Chinese Diabetic Coronary Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This study multicenter registry hold China main land . A total 1,000 diabetic patient coronary artery disease receive RESOLUTE zotarolimus elute stent implantation 20 study center enrol . The estimated follow-up duration 12-month . Clinical event , laboratory examination result related data record time point 30 day , 6-month 12-month . Patients quit half-way replaced reason report . All data collection management , analysis supervision accomplish independent study institution . STUDY POPULATION All 1,000 patient enrolled registry receive RESOLUTE zotarolimus elute stent implantation diagnose type 2 diabetes previously hospital PCI procedure . Glucose level ( fast 2h post-meal ) , HbA1c medication record enrollment follow-up period . STUDY DURATION The estimate follow-up duration 12-month . Clinical event , laboratory examination result related data record time point 30 day , 6-month 12-month . STUDY PROCESS Patients sign inform consent provide sign date copy . Interventional process ( PCI discharge ) : The stent implantation process consistent international standard procedure guideline . Other PCI technique , include atherectomy , intravascular ultrasound , optical interference laminagraphy , pressure guide wire technology , intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation use accord opinion operator . Antiplatelet drug anticoagulant therapy determine study center . The use glucoprotein Ⅱb/Ⅲa inhibitor antiplatelet drug ciloprost determine operator . The standard instrument success procedure success : Standard instrument success : After successful convery RESOLUTE stent system successful implantation , remain stenosis rate diameter le 50 % TIMI grade 3 , without use interventional technique . Standard procedure success : With kind interventional therapy , remain stenosis rate diameter le 20 % ( ocular estimation ) , without occurrence death , myocardial infarction target lesion revascularization hospitalization . Post-procedural follow-up After stent implantation , patient follow time point 30-day , 6-month 12-month . The follow-up include angina evaluation ( accord Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification Braunwald Classification unstable angina ) . Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , fast glucose level , Total Cholesterol , LDL level . Clinical event include death , myocardial infarction , ST , stroke , bleed revascularization . Quantification angiography ( QCA ) All angiographic result baseline immediately post-procedure sent laboratory SNOC medical technology independent QCA analysis MEDCON TCS QCA software . Reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) , minimal lumen diameter ( MLD ) , stent length , stenosis percent ( diameter ) relate data reevaluate . ADVERSE EVENT REPORT PROCESS Adverse event supervision committee The Clinical Events Committee ( CEC ) compose interventional expert relationship Medtronic study center , directly attend current study . CEC supervise determine event accord current guideline well regulation immobilize current study . CEC also inspection determination accord study endpoint base systemic analysis raw data collection , electrocardiogram , angiography ensure central , systemic , standardized , independent impartial evaluate process . Definition adverse event cop management The adverse event refers unacceptable clinical event may result instrument , Zotarolimus , operative procedure drug necessary study ( example , aspirin Plavix ) . Self-consciously reported adverse event encourage current study . Any time follow-up , patient inquire information likely adverse event directly main center . If adverse event determine , relate information collect related table fulfil immediately researcher . Severe adverse event ( SAE ) Severe adverse event refer death , life-threatening disease injury , permanent impairment body structure function , prolong hospital stay hospitalization , congenital anomaly induce event likely judge CEC . All severe adverse event report SAE . Any time SAE occur , regardless relationship study product , proper therapeutic measure load immediately . At meantime , case report include SAE specific report table send main researcher , register supervisor telephone email within 24 hour . The report relate administration within prescriptive time window also carry order assist inquiry hold competent department take proper strategy redress protocol ensure prevention measure . Follow-up duration adverse event All adverse event followed-up treat resolved acquire stable endpoint Premature termination study case may result follow reason : 1 . Patent 's decision quit . 2 . Fail follow-up : write form mail verification send patient ca n't contact telephone . If communication fails , case mark fail follow-up . Reasons quit It encourage provide information follow-up . If patient decide quit , reason record immediately . Possible reason may include : 1. . Patient 's decision inform consent retract . 2. . Adverse event : patient follow fully recover acquire clinically stable . 3）Fail follow-up : write form mail verification send patient ca n't contact telephone . If communication fails , case mark fail follow-up . Once chance confirm patient 's condition , also record . Interrupted case include research analysis .</detailed_description>
