	<brief_summary>Background : - Alzheimer disease ( AD ) brain disease impairs memory , cognitive ability ability function independently . It common cause dementia old people . It cause abnormal protein brain affect neuron communicate . Researchers look drug slow disease treat symptom . One drug , call bisnorcymserine ( BNC ) , may help improve brain function symptom people AD . BNC design block chemical affect neuron communicate . Researchers want see BNC work healthy old volunteer . Objectives : - To look body process bisnorcymserine take mouth safe healthy old volunteer . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 55 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood urine test . - Within 3 week screen visit , participant come National Institute Aging clinical unit 2-night stay . On morning second day , take either BNC capsule placebo . They know tablet taking . - Blood sample collect frequently throughout second third day study visit . The last blood sample collect 32 hour take study capsule . Participants heart function test exams visit . Once test do , leave clinical center . - Participants final follow-up visit 1 week leave clinical center .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Alzheimer disease ( AD ) progressive neurodegenerative disease impairs memory cognitive ability , well behavior ability function independently . It common cause dementia among old people . Alzheimer disease characterize deficit several neurotransmitter system , prominently acetylcholine ( Ach ) . The cholinergic deficit AD brain associate cognitive functional symptom AD . Restoring deficit cholinergic system one proven approach symptomatic treatment AD . The action Ach brain terminate mainly two enzyme call cholinesterase ( ChEs ) : acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) . Inhibitors enzymes therefore augment activity survive Ach neuron AD . All ChEs inhibitor currently approve treatment AD mainly inhibit AChE , secondarily vary extent , BChE . Reversible brain-specific BChE inhibitor develop class drug call cymserine analog . Scientists NIA/NIH develop novel BChE inhibitor call Bisnorcymserine ( BNC ) . Pre-clinical evidence suggest BNC may safe treatment Alzheimer disease . Based , propose first-in-human study evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics single dos BNC tartrate administer orally . Study population : Healthy volunteer age 55 year old . Design : Double blind placebo-controlled Phase I clinical Trial single oral dos BNC dose ascend schedule : 20 , 40mg , 80 mg , 160 mg , 270 mg 380 mg. Each dose test group 8 subject . Six subject cohort receive active drug two receive placebo . Subjects kept unit follow clinically laboratory test adverse effect 32 hour ; return follow-up visit ass safety 7 day . A Data Safety Monitoring Board evaluate safety tolerability associate dose level next high dose test new cohort . All research perform National Institute Aging ( NIA ) Clinical Research Unit locate 5th floor MedStar Harbor Hospital .</detailed_description>
