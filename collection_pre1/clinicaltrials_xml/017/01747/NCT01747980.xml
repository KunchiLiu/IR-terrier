	<brief_summary>Absorption therapeutic protein take orally remained major hurdle treatment human . The protein generally degrade enzymes stomach intestine intestine lining prevents absorption circulation . Administration PRX-112 , plant recombinant human glucocerebrosidase ( prGCD ) use plant cell carrier vehicle , may help overcome many hurdle . The plant cell wall protect protein degradation transport upper GI allow release low intestine . Studies animal show prGCD deliver way find blood stream active form .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This exploratory , open-label safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study design assess delivery prGCD oral administration PRX-112 Gaucher subject . Subjects receive oral dose PRX-112 single administration follow 3 consecutive daily administration dose . prGCD level plasma determine selected time point . Safety parameter also assess select time point . Enrollment proceed next dosage cohort pharmacokinetic safety data previous cohort review . A different dosage may select base pharmacokinetic result first cohort .</detailed_description>
