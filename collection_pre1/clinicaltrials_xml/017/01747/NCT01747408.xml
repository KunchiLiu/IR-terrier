	<brief_summary>The propose study set evaluate tolerability safety 25 % human albumin ( HA ) therapy patient subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . It estimate 37,500 people USA SAH every year . SAH associate 51 % mortality rate one third survivor leave functionally dependent . Cerebral vasospasm ( CV ) identify important reason neurological deterioration . CV may due multiple molecular mechanism . The use neuroprotective agent various action , like HA , would important prevention CV improve clinical outcome patient SAH . The propose open-label , dose-escalation study important public health implication provide necessary information definitive phase III clinical trial regard efficacy treatment HA patient SAH . The study enroll maximum 80 patient SAH meet eligibility criterion . Four dosage HA ( 0.625 , 1.25 , 1.875 , 2.5 g/kg ) administer daily seven day evaluate . The low dosage evaluate first group 20 subject . A specific safety threshold define base data previous study . The Data Safety Monitoring Board approve disapprove advance next high HA dosage base evaluation rate congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . The study assess three outcome : safety tolerability HA dosages functional outcome . The primary tolerability outcome define subject 's ability receive full allocate dose HA without incur frank CHF require termination treatment . Secondary safety outcomes serious adverse event ( include neurological medical complication , anaphylactic reaction ) . Neurological complication comprise incidence CV , rebleeding , hydrocephalus , seizures treatment . The three-month functional outcome determine , Glasgow Outcome Scale , Barthel Index , modify Rankin Scale , NIH Stroke Scale Stroke Impact Scale measure obtain preliminary estimate treatment effect HA . The timeline study three year .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients ( male female ) must least 18 young 80 year age . Onset new neurological sign subarachnoid hemorrhage within 72 hour time evaluation initiation treatment 25 % human albumin . Clinical sign consistent diagnosis subarachnoid hemorrhage include severe thunderclap headache , cranial nerve abnormality , decrease level consciousness , meningismus focal neurological deficit . Head compute tomography demonstrate subarachnoid hemorrhage ( rating scale 24 ) . Cerebral angiography reveals presence saccular aneurysm ( ) location explain subarachnoid hemorrhage . Treatment cerebral aneurysm must carry prior treatment initiation within 72 hour symptom onset . Accepted treatment aneurysms include surgical clip endovascular embolization . Signed date informed write consent subject his/her legally authorize representative . Time symptom onset reliably assess . No demonstrable aneurysm cerebral angiography . Evidence traumatic , mycotic , fusiform aneurysm cerebral angiography . World Federation Neurological Surgeons scale IV V Head compute tomography rating scale 0 1 History within past 6 month , and/or physical finding admission decompensated heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV heart failure require hospitalization ) . Patient receive albumin prior treatment assignment present admission . Hospitalization diagnosis acute myocardial infarction within precede 3 month . Symptoms electrocardiographic sign indicative acute myocardial infarction admission . Electrocardiographic evidence and/or physical finding compatible second thirddegree heart block , cardiac arrhythmia associate hemodynamic instability . Echocardiogram perform treatment revealing leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; = 40 % ( available ) . Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min . Pregnancy , lactation parturition within previous 30 day . Known allergy albumin . Severe prior physical disability ( Rankin Scale &gt; 2 ) precludes evaluation clinical outcome measure . History severe chronic obstructive lung disease ( FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict , increased shortness breath , repeat exacerbation impact patient ' quality life ) . History confirm suspect liver failure ( increase prothrombin time , elevate liver enzyme , hypoalbuminemia , hyperbilirrubinemia without peripheral edema encephalopathy ) Current participation another drug treatment protocol . Severe terminal disease life expectancy le 6 month .</criteria>
