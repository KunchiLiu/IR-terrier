	<detailed_description>Rationale Study Despite significant advance management ventricular arrhythmia use ICD therapy , AADs , catheter-based ablation strategy , considerable challenge remain . The optimal method prevention ICD shock remain unclear . RSDN may effective tool prevent ventricular arrhythmia , associate ICD therapy , reduce central sympathetic tone , catecholamine level , renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Although RSDN show reduce recurrence VT case report 2 patient suffer electrical storm , date large prospective randomize study evaluate impact RSDN primary prevention ICD therapy patient ischemic non-ischemic ventricular dysfunction . Also note , data suggest RSDN may even decrease rate supraventricular arrhythmia atrial fibrillation . Thus , RESCUE specifically evaluate safety efficacy RSDN prevention ICD therapy patient ventricular dysfunction receive ICD either secondary prevention , primary prevention inducible VT program ventricular stimulation time ICD implantation . Description Procedures Screening : To take part study , must meet study requirement . The screening visit test procedures do see eligible study . The study doctor review let know qualify . The study doctor make final decision possible study qualification . Pre-randomization Procedures : After provide write consent follow data collect examination test perform : - A physical examination - Your blood pressure take - A review medical history medication take - A blood sample drawn routine laboratory test . - Women child take urine pregnancy test . The test must negative study . - A Transthoracic Echocardiogram ( TTE ) -a non-invasive test probe place chest wall image take chest wall heart valve heart muscle , measure leave ventricular size ( heart wall thickness ) mitral inflow ( flow blood heart valve ) . - An ICD interrogation ( already ICD implant ) - non-invasive test device place chest wall near ICD , data transmit wirelessly ICD laptop physician review . - An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) - non-invasive test several probe place chest wall measure electrical activity heart . Randomization : Immediately follow catheter ablation , patient undergo renal angiogram order assess suitability catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation . A renal angiogram x-ray study blood vessel kidney evaluate blockage , abnormality could affect blood supply kidney . It perform inject contrast dye catheter ( tiny tube ) blood vessel kidney . The study doctor ass whether renal artery suitable receive catheter-based renal denervation . Once agree participate study , sign informed consent , determine eligible participate randomize one two treatment group immediately follow renal angiogram . Randomization mean put group chance . It like flip coin . You equal chance ( 50 % ) place either group . This study design single-blinded ; know ahead time group . Only physician know group randomize . If already ICD , undergo ICD placement part routine clinical care . You may undergo ICD placement 1 month ( 30 day ) randomization . An ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ) small battery-powered electrical impulse generator implant patient risk sudden cardiac death due ventricular fibrillation ventricular tachycardia . The device program detect abnormal heart beat ( cardiac arrhythmia ) correct deliver jolt electricity . The first group undergo catheter-based sympathetic renal denervation . Renal Sympathetic Denervation procedure use catheter probe insert renal ( kidney ) artery deactivate nerve link high blood pressure . The second group ( control group ) receive intervention ICD implantation .</detailed_description>
