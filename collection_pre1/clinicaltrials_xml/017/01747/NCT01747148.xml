	<brief_summary>Background : - Influenza ( flu ) virus cause people get sick . Most time , flu cause mild illness , people become seriously ill even die . Currently , pill inhale powder use treat flu , make flu symptom end day sooner . More treatment choice flu need , especially become seriously ill . Researchers want test new drug , AVI-7100 , might keep person take serious case flu . Objectives : - To see healthy adult volunteer tolerate AVI-7100 anti-influenza drug . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer normal weight 18 60 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . A heart function test also perform . - Participants either AVI-7100 placebo infusion . They know infusion . . Participants stay clinical center total 8 hour infusion . Blood sample collect 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 hour end infusion - Participants return Days 1 , 2 , 4 , 10 , 28 receive drug . Blood urine sample collect . A heart function test also perform . - There second part study separate first one . Additional people receive either AVI-7100 placebo test reaction specific dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite currently available antiviral , influenza cause significant morbidity mortality ( estimate 36,000 deaths year United States alone ) . More agent need armamentarium anti-influenza medication include novel mechanisms action parenteral agent . This study evaluate safety novel RNA base therapeutic AVI-7100 . Beginning low single-dose , subject randomize receive either AVI-7100 placebo evaluate Study Days 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 10 , 28 . The safety tolerability evaluate use symptom , clinical laboratory test , ECG , pharmacokinetics . Utilizing series stopping rule medical monitor , dose escalate safety tolerability establish . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish first part study ( either limited adverse effect maximum anticipated dose ) , safety tolerability multi-dose administration begin ( replicate anticipate clinical use ) . Subjects randomized either AVI-7100 placebo daily 5 day , evaluate Study Days 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 14 , 32 . The dose use multi-dose cohort also escalate safety tolerability establish .</detailed_description>
