	<brief_summary>The `` dry eye syndrome '' DES highly prevalent ocular disease , particular elderly population . One mainstay therapy patient suffer DES use topically administer lubricant . However , despite many effort , `` ideal '' formulation yet find . Recently , Croma Pharma introduce chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop , design treatment symptom related DES . Chemically , chitosan polycationic biopolymer favourable biological property high biocompatibility low toxicity . Additionally , new formulation comprise N-acetylcysteine , use ophthalmology mucolytic property several year . Based theoretical consideration , one hypothesize new chitosan derivative may show increased adhesion mucin ocular surface may therefore particularly beneficial reduce symptom associate DES . We recently show phase I trial single instillation chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop well tolerate young healthy subject . However , data yet available safety tolerability chitosan-N-acetylcysteine subject wear contact lens . This special interest tear film critical successful contact lens wear . Disturbances quantity quality tear film result intolerance contact lens wear possible damage ocular surface . This trial seek investigate local tolerability possible ocular discomfort chitosan-N-acetylcysteine eye drop repeat instillation .</brief_summary>
