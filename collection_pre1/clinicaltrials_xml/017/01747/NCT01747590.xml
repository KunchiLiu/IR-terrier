	<brief_summary>The primary goal double-blind , placebo-controlled , within-subjects functional neuroimaging study examine extent hypnotic zolpidem decrease brain activity region brain known process emotional information . Although zolpidem effective sleep-aid , ability engender anti-anxiety effect equivocal , yet promise . Zolpidem 's activity task engage anxiety-related process brain compare known anxiolytic drug alprazolam , positive comparator caffeine , placebo . A secondary goal study compare subjective drug effect , individual feel , follow intervention .

	<detailed_description>Benzodiazepines ( BZs ) relate drug commonly prescribe treat anxiety sleep disorder . Their clinical utility base behavioral effect attribute positive allosteric modulation GABA-A receptor . Multiple subtypes GABAA receptor exist , recent research focus understanding role BZ-sensitive GABAA receptor ( i.e. , receptor contain alpha-1 , alpha-2 , alpha-3 , alpha-5 protein subunit ) behavioral effect BZ-type drug . Results body work suggest anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect BZ-like drug likely involve alpha-2- and/or alpha-3-containing GABAA receptor , sedative-like effect attributable alpha-1GABAA receptor . Compared BZs , BZ-like hypnotic zolpidem exhibit relative selectivity alpha-1GABAA receptor . Although selectivity believe underlie superior hypnotic ability , zolpidem 's ability engender anxiolytic-like effect inconsistent . Zolpidem 's primary effect include anxiolysis give preference interact alpha-1GABAA receptor abundant distribution sensorimotor cortex extrapyramidal motor area relative enrich distribution receptor subtypes throughout limbic system , anterior thalamus , caudate nucleus . However , amygdala , brain region show intricately involved anxiety-related neuronal process , high level alpha-1 GABAA receptor well alpha-2 alpha-3GABAA receptor express . Among anxiety-related process typically study empirically , ability recognize emotion important proxy psychopathology . Neuroimaging study show ability process emotional stimulus require coordinate activity amygdala , insula , prefrontal cortical region . Individuals suffer anxiety disorder exhibit impaired ability recognize facial emotion , associate aberrant amygdala activation . Importantly respect pharmacological manipulation anxiety-related brain function , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study examine neural correlate emotional processing employ acute challenge potent anxiolytic demonstrate significant reduction blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal within amygdala insula . The primary aim study outline protocol demonstrate drug-induced difference limbic activation fMRI-based emotional face recognition task follow acute administration zolpidem , alprazolam , positive control caffeine healthy volunteer . Although zolpidem may exhibit similar behavioral pharmacological profile conventional BZs many instance , relative GABAA receptor selectivity distinguish non-selective counterpart . Thus hypothesize anxiolytic alprazolam ( 1 mg ) reduce BOLD response emotional face within amygdala insula similar anxiolytic ( e.g. , lorazepam , diazepam , pregabalin ) , hypnotic zolpidem ( 10 mg ) cause reduction . It hypothesize adenosine receptor localize amygdala caffeine show anxiogenic , acute challenge moderate dose caffeine ( 200 mg ) enhance BOLD response amygdala and/or insula face recognition task . The data collect aim provide first vivo brain image evidence different action base different GABAA receptor pharmacological profile zolpidem alprazolam , support clinical role treatment insomnia anxiety , respectively . The secondary aim project collect information regard subjective drug effect four intervention . This information , conjunction data show treatment affect brain activity , permit visualization neurobiological substrate drug action . For instance , previous study find zolpidem-induced increase self-reported rating `` like '' , `` high '' , intoxication relate increase brain activity specific limbic network . Our data consistent area show previously undergo hemodynamic metabolic alteration association subjective state intoxication follow administration cocaine , alcohol , hydromorphone , speak body literature implicate limbic , paralimbic , mesocortical region mediate action psychotropic drug . Because alprazolam known posse abuse potential general , result present study may confirm previous finding also demonstrate investigate pharmacological effect brain activity may help identify neural correlate drug action behavior , thereby reveal functional significance GABAergic modulation intrinsic brain activity . A total 12 healthy normal drug-naïve volunteer enrol McLean Hospital participate 5-visit ( 1 screen visit , 4 study visit ) double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Participants 21 40 year age , either male female , restriction regard ethnic background . Participants past current neurological psychiatric disorder ( include substance abuse and/or dependence ) , family history alcoholism , medical condition could affect drug disposition , take medication . Participants also MRI scan contraindication ( include pregnancy ) . They must able provide inform consent . Volunteers visit laboratory screen visit s/he sign inform consent form , undergo physical psychiatric exam . The second , third , fourth , fifth visit involve pre-study assessment , standard breakfast , questionnaire set , drug treatment , one scanning session , lunch . After baseline period participant answer computerized questionnaire , receive study medication ( zolpidem [ 10 mg ] , alprazolam [ 1 mg ] , caffeine [ 200 mg ] , placebo ) answer questionnaire . At 60-min post-medication , participant position within scanner , perform task , blood pressure/heart rate monitor continuously , eye-tracking device ass eye open . The scan session last approximately 1 hr , follow hourly questionnaire set 6-hrs post-medication . Participants take taxicab home time . The entire visit last approximately 8 hr . An exhaustive screening procedure ensure participant enter study contraindicate condition . All procedure perform expert specifically train respective area minimize risk , discomfort , adverse event . Participants well inform potential risk study . The informed consent form detail explicit . Participants provide unlimited time read consent study personnel review detail participant sign . In addition , participant opportunity ask question , , consent time study . Participants earn total $ 500 complete study .</detailed_description>
