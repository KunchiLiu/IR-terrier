	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Chronic liver disease important cause morbidity mortality United States . A retrospective cohort study identify 2,353 patient newly diagnose chronic liver disease ( 63.9 cases/100,000 population ) 1,2 Extrapolating incidence rate approximately 150,000 patient chronic liver disease diagnose gastroenterology clinic year 1 . Almost 20 % , estimate 30,000 patient per year , establish cirrhosis time presentation gastroenterologist 3 . Cirrhosis remain major public health problem disease-related complication associate nearly 40,000 death 1.4 billion dollar spend medical service US . There great need develop identify method risk stratification prognostication patient chronic liver disease 4 Hepatic fibrosis final common pathway many different liver insult know dynamic process least partially reversible . The diagnosis quantification fibrosis relies liver biopsy 5 , liver biopsy currently gold standard detect stag hepatic fibrosis 6 . However , liver biopsy invasive procedure significant risk , include hemorrhage , infection visceral perforation . In addition , liver biopsy poor gold standard , limited interobserver variability interpretation sample error 25-45 % cases5,6 , . A number indirect marker index liver fibrosis used clinical practice . Noninvasive test distinguish direct vs. indirect measure fibrosis also classify modality test serum vs. imaging.7 Biomarkers structural element fibrogenesis key inflammatory mediator involve genesis degradation scar tissue often refer direct component . Indirect marker reflect accompany alteration hepatic function . Fibrotic liver demonstrate increase stiffness . This property exploit measure use newly develop ultrasound technology name Ultrasound Elastography ( Transient Elastography ( TE ) sonoelastography ( SE ) 8 . SE perform insonating patient low energy , low amplitude , low frequency shear wave create focus ultrasound vibrate probe skin . The small tissue movement produce propagated wave measure ultrasound . The propagated wave travel faster increase fibrosis : stiffer tissue , fast shear wave propagates.9 A pulse-echo ultrasound acquisition allow measurement wave velocity result present kilopascals ( kPa ) . Tissue elasticity calculate median 10 measurement range 2.5 75 kPa normal value around 5.5 kPa10 ( Normal liver stiffness range 3.3-7.8 kPa ) 11 Hepatic stiffness measure within cylinder tissue 1 cm wide 4 cm length produce estimate sample area 100 time great biopsy.12,13 A meta-analysis assess capacity transient elastography diagnose moderate fibrosis find pooled estimate sensitivity specificity 70 % 84 % respectively12,13 . The mean AUROC diagnosis significant fibrosis 0.84 % optimal cut-off 7.6 kPa , diagnostic accuracy SE cirrhosis AUROC range 0.90- 0.99 ( mean AUROC 0.94 ) cut-off 9.0 26.5 kPa.14,15 The benefit SE inexpensive , reproducible , painless , rapid ( &lt; 10 min ) , easy perform , use diagnosis , prognosis monitoring disease progression.15 Limitations sonoelastography measurement obtain presence mark obesity , ascites , unusually narrow intercostal space externally apply vibrate shear wave generator use . 15,16 SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To evaluate liver stiffness diagnostic imaging method sonoelastography among adult suspect liver disease . 2 . To obtain estimate sensitivity specificity sonoelastography detection stag liver fibrosis . STUDY PROCEDURES Study Visit 1 : ( SE sonoelastography ) - Sonoelastography perform prior standard pre-biopsy ultrasound image use FDA-approved ultrasound unit . This unit use ultrasound energy within limit set FDA diagnostic ultrasound create shear wave front progressively distorted traverse tissue . Ultrafast ultrasound image use detect speed propagation shear wave front . - The unit emit ionize radiation perform ultrasound acquisition within acoustic power intensity limit establish FDA diagnostic sonography . At energy level know bioeffects ultrasound . Sonoelastography measurement require approximately 15 minute , painless . - The unit cart-based ultrasound system use perform non-invasive diagnostic ultrasound study . The system function manner identical diagnostic ultrasound system transducer conventional mode : B-mode , Harmonic imaging , Spatial Compounding image Power Doppler . Additionally , system use new image mode base shear wave elastography map tissue stiffness . The elastography mode produce color-coded image different tissue base elasticity . The color scale represent quantitative assessment tissue stiffness , thereby allow elasticity tissue quantify unit kilopascals ( kPa ) . - At conclusion Study Visit 1 , patient return usual care . Tests Parameters : Sonoelastography parameter : Mean liver stiffness ( elastogram ) kilopascal ( kPa ) . SE normal value approximately 5.5 kPa ( Normal liver stiffness range 3.3-7.8 kPa ) Significant Fibrosis ( F3 ) : = &gt; 7.6 kPa , Cirrhosis ( F4 ) : = &gt; 9.0- 26 kPa Data Collection Data collect include : - Gender , ethnicity , Age , BMI , History previous current medication use , detail history alcohol intake , comorbidities , sign symptom . - Biochemical liver test typically perform part routine clinical care ( AST , ALT , APH , GGT , TB , IB , DB , Albumin , Total proteins , PT ) . Other laboratory data typically perform part routine clinical care : RBC , WBC , Platelets , Glucose , Creatinine , lipid profile . Any laboratory study diagnosis suspect diffuse liver disease : Viral serology , include HCV , HBV , Ferritin , ceruloplasmin , AMA , ANA , Alphafetoprotein . Any liver histopathologic report . - Sonoelastography report . TABLE 1 : Measure parameter grade fibrosis/cirrhosis sonoelastography Histology . 5,8 , ,15 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Fibrosis marker Fibrosis Cirrhosis SonoElastography Normal liver stiffness range 3.3-7.8 kPa Significant Fibrosis ( F3 ) : 7.6 kPa Cirrhosis ( F4 ) : 9.0- 26 kPa Histology ( METAVIR ) F0- No fibrosis F1- Portal fibrosis without septa F2- Portal fibrosis rare septa F3- Numerous septum without cirrhosis F4- Cirrhosis Descriptive statistic show mean Â± standard deviation percentage appropriate . The patient divide accord fibrosis stage . The group ' binary diagnostic different diagnostic method compare gold standard McNemar 's Test . We use contingency table analyze correlation sonoelastographic measurement . Factors independently correlate liver stiffness assess multiple regression analysis . The diagnostic performance fibrosis and/or liver stiffness determine term sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , diagnostic accuracy area receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve . This pilot study investigator plan enroll 100 subject include study . With 100 patient include study investigator &gt; 80 % power detect significant diagnostic power SonoElastography true AUC 0.85 oppose null AUC 0.62 low use two-sided test 5 % type I error . In addition , multivariate linear logistic regression model use evaluate diagnostic power independent factor take account possible confounders patient demographic clinical characteristic . The primary outcome interest fibrosis . RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Ultrasound Elastography : Ultrasound elastography require administration ultrasound energy level similar use diagnostic ultrasonography . There know bioeffects ultrasound energy . Pregnant woman exclude study . There known risk sonoelastography embryo fetus ( develop baby still womb ) . There may risk embryo fetus currently unknown . POTENTIAL BENEFITS Although knowledge liver diseases fibrosis increase dramatically last year , much remain learned . The image strategy evaluate , ultrasound sonoelastography , potential reduce number liver biopsy perform diagnosis monitoring hepatic fibrosis . This study expect provide basis future investigation non-invasive imaging marker hepatic fibrosis . Any data obtain purpose study available subject 's primary physician .</detailed_description>
