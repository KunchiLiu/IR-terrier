	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Sacral Colpopexy Versus Modified Total Pelvic Floor Reconstructive Surgery Apical Prolapse Stage III-IV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse common problem . The high rate failure lead increase use synthetic graft augment vaginal repair procedure obtain durable result . In 2005 , investigator begin perform modify pelvic floor reconstruction surgery mesh . The nation-wide multicenter prospective clinical trial data show safe , efficient cost-effective . No severe intraoperative complication record recurrence rate 1 year follow-up 8.1 % . Quality life improve significantly baseline , sexual function change . Sacral colpopexy long regard gold standard . Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy could offer durable result low morbidity compare open procedure . In clinical practice , many woman symptomatic POP-Q Stage III-IV uterine vault prolapse , require surgical correction . The aim multicenter , prospective randomize study evaluate effectiveness safety two procedure treatment symptomatic apical prolapse Stage III-IV China .</detailed_description>
