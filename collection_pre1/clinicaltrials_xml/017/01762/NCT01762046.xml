	<brief_summary>The SUGAR-MGH investigator study influence inherit gene variant response two commonly prescribe type 2 diabetes medication , metformin glipizide . They hypothesize variant gene associate type 2 diabetes related trait may impact effect anti-diabetic medication . In addition , physiological response insulin secretagogue insulin sensitizer may shed light mechanism action report genetic association .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several common genetic variant reliably associate type 2 diabetes related glycemic trait . Study investigator hypothesize variant gene reproducibly associate type 2 diabetes related glycemic trait may impact effect anti-diabetic medication . In particular , sulfonylurea may differential effect individual depend allelic variant carry KCNJ11 E23K ; conversely , TCF7L2 postulate influence insulin secretion regulate action glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , sulfonylureas act different step insulin secretion pathway , effect sulfonylureas insulin secretion could independent genetic variation TCF7L2 . In addition , physiological response insulin secretagogue insulin sensitizer may shed light mechanism action report genetic association . Despite convincing association several genetic variant type 2 diabetes involvement physiological pathway involve drug response , impact pharmacological intervention systematically examine . The completion Human Genome Project high-density characterization common human variation four different ethnic group highlight promise genomic medicine . The elucidation genetic architecture complex phenotype may help clinician understand disease heterogeneity , uncover new pathophysiological mechanism , open opportunity novel therapeutic intervention , provide predictive diagnostic prognostic information , allow individually tailored therapy take account probability response incidence drug-induced complication .</detailed_description>
