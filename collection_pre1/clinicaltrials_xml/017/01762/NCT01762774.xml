	<brief_summary>This study First Time Human Study GSK2256294 evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) single repeat oral dos GSK2256294 administer healthy male volunteer ( Cohort 1 ) otherwise healthy adult male moderately obese smoker ( Cohorts 2 4 ) . Cohorts 1 2 enrol 12 subject subject take part four study period . All subject receive placebo regimen three dose regimen GSK2256294 specify sequence ( plan dose 2 mg , 6 mg 18 mg Cohort 1 15 mg , 40 mg 100 mg Cohort 2 ) . Each study period follow Wash-out period 7 14 day Cohort 1 4 week Cohort 2 . During study period subject in-house Day -1 48 hour post dose assessment complete . Subjects return unit out-patients remain post-dose assessment . Subjects follow 7 14 day Cohort 1 3 4 week Cohort 2 . Total duration study Cohort 1 98 day Cohort 2 144 day . Cohort 3 4 recruit 15 subject . For Cohorts 3 4 , subject take part one treatment period 18 day ( Day-1 Day 17 ) dose Day 1 Day 14 . Subjects follow 7 14 day . Total duration study Cohort 3 Cohort 4 67 day . Dose selection Cohorts 3 4 base safety , PK profile enzyme inhibition obtain Cohorts 1 2 . This study also evaluate evidence functional effect soluble Epoxide Hydrolase ( sEH ) forearm blood flow ( FBF ) model .</brief_summary>
