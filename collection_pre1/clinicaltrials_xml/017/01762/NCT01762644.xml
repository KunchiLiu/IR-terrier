	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination oral cyclosporine , immune therapy oral omeprazole , proton pump inhibitor , effective render insulin independence among recent onset type 1 diabetes patient . This two-arm study design evaluate safety efficacy insulin independence two FDA EMA-approved therapy among recent onset type 1 diabetes patient . One great new insight today field type 1 diabetes , understand man , unlike success see type 1 diabetes mouse model , beta cell regeneration immune therapy alone . In man , type 1 diabetes consider disease autoimmunity lack beta cell regeneration ( Levetan 2103 ) . More 500 patient new onset type 1 diabetes give cyclosporine study demonstrate high 57 % insulin-free remission rate sustain due lack beta cell regeneration ( Feutren 1986 , Bougneres 1988 , Eisenbarth 1989 , Sobel 2010 ) . Studies among diabetes patient proton pump inhibitor show potential increase beta cell mass 40 % , among type 1 patient without immune protection , outcomes achieve ( Singh 2012 , Griffin 2014 ) . The usage beta cell regeneration agent omeprazole , combination immune tolerance , like cyclosporine , provide potential ability maintain regenerate beta cell . This new paradigm treatment new onset type 1 diabetes . More 60 human trial conduct among type 1 diabetes variety different therapy aim prevent autoimmune attack insulin-producing beta cell . None effective cyclosporine slow decline beta cell mass result potential insulin-free remission . ( Canadian-European Randomized Control Trial 1988 , Eisenbarth 1989 , Skyler 1992 , Sobel 2010 ) . Because cyclosporine know potential side-effects , notably kidney , previous study among type 1 patient carefully monitor kidney function . Follow-up study 13 year among 285 type 1 patient utilizing cyclosporine 20 month demonstrate renal side effect dosage use trial ( Assan 2002 ) . The effective initiating dosage insulin independence cyclosporine trial 7.5 mg/kg/day , safety , study begin low dosage 5 mg/kg/day monitor kidney function cyclosporine level initially weekly basis . This study use dosages cyclosporine demonstrate toxicity kidney result non-reversible side effect among 500 patient recent onset type 1 diabetes treat cyclosporine . Omeprazole show significantly increase gastrin level associate increase beta cell . Lansoprazole also show safe among patient new onset type 1 diabetes one year trend toward increase beta cell mass among patient higher gastrin level . In randomized trial 12 week among 56 patient undergoing pancreatectomy , randomize receive proton pump inhibitor significantly increase gastrin level , high insulin level improve endocrine function glucose tolerance test less pancreatic atrophy measure CT scan ( Jang 2003 ) . The recently complete REPAIR T1D trial among newly diagnose type 1 patient use proton pump inhibitor GLP-1 therapy 1 year beta regeneration fail meet endpoint increase stimulate C-peptide . Lack maintenance regeneration beta cell specifically note likely due lack usage immune therapy protect beta cell ( Griffin 2014 , Rigby 2014 ) . Those patient REPAIR T1D , achieve gastrin GLP-1 level control group trend towards improve preservation C-peptide suggestion decrease rate fall C-peptide 12 month ( Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data ) . Glucose level also trend low control intervention arm gastrin level control arm ( Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data ) . In human , newly form beta cell great immune attack among type 1 patient ( Meier 2006 ) . REPAIR T1D underscore importance immune therapy regeneration therapy among type 1 patient ( Griffin 2014 , Rigby 2014 ) . The combination cyclosporine proton pump inhibitor potential demonstrate maintenance expansion residual beta cell . This combination therapy provide unique ability patient become insulin independent . For request reference , please email info @ perlebioscience.com</brief_summary>
