	<brief_summary>The investigator check feasibility use early molecular response make treatment decision . Patients diagnose chronic myeloid leukemia commence imatinib treatment . After 3 month treatment response assess . If molecular response would less 10 % ( BCR-ABL1/ABL ISI &gt; 10 % ) imatinib therapy stop patient start different TKI ( nilotinib , dasatinib ) . The investigator follow lab clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Modification Based Early Assessment CML Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : To establish national protocol treatment patient CML . Patients stratify molecular response , treatment adjust accordingly . Secondary outcome To compare clinical outcome patient high risk ( transcript level 10 % ) low risk ( &lt; 10 % ) use early switch approach To evaluate prognostic value EUTOS , HASFORD , SOKAL score use early switch strategy Patients Patients may enrol protocol prior TKI treatment time point commencement imatinib ( start 400 mg daily ) prior 3 month assessment , necessary baseline data available , inclusion criterion meet ( patient exclude received treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib ) Inclusion criterion : 1 . Adult patient within 6 month diagnosis Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML chronic phase 1. previously treat ( exception hydroyurea ) CML 2. treat imatinib CML 3 month , prior 3 month assessment ( patient exclude received treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib ) . 2 . Age &gt; 18 year Diagnosis CML make conventional cytogenetic ( chromosome banding analysis ) and/or interphase fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis bone marrow contain least one Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphase cell . If BCR-ABL1 fusion gene ( Philadelphia chromosome ) detect conventional cytogenetic analysis , diagnosis CML confirm base FISH analysis molecular analysis ( demonstration bcr-abl polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ) . Inclusion patient organ dysfunction ( cardiac , renal , respiratory , liver ) do base decision treat physician . Exclusion criterion : Patients exclude received treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib ( i.e. , nilotinib , dasatinib ) study entry . Patients may take hydroxyurea anagrelide 4 week prior imatinib treatment . Interventions Imatinib 400 mg daily Response assess 3 month therapy . A complete blood count ass hematologic response bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate , include cytogenetic analysis molecular analysis quantitative RT-PCR BCR-ABL1/ABL performed . Response assessment Assessment response molecular analysis bcr-abl1 perform certified standardized laboratory ( list certify laboratory distribute ) . If patient achieve CHR BCR-ABL1/ABL ISI &lt; 10 % 3 month imatinib continue dose 400 mg daily . If patient achieve CHR BCR-ABL1/ABL ISI &gt; 10 % 3 month imatinib stop nilotinib 300 mg twice daily dasatinib 100 mg daily institute . ECG do prior change therapy . Mutation analysis recommend prior commencement nilotinib dasatinib . Patients continue receive study treatment disease progress unacceptable toxic effect develop . In event disease progression occurrence adverse event treatment stop change discretion treat physician . Outcomes Rate CCyR 12 month CCyR define absence Ph-positive metaphase , determine basis G-banding least 20 cell metaphase per bone marrow sample Overall survival Rate major molecular response 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month Cumulative rate optimal response 12 , 18 month PFS : Time commencement imatinib till meet ELN criterion failure , progression AP/BC , death cause EFS : Time commencement imatinib till meet ELN criterion failure , progression AP/BC , grade 3 4 adverse event , drug discontinuation ( except change imatinib 3 month accord molecular response ) , death cause Safety : Adverse event classify accord CTCAE NCI US v.3.0 Severe AE</detailed_description>
