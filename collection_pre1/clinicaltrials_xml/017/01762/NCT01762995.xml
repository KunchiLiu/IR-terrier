	<brief_summary>Human immune virus ( HIV ) infect subject may take mineral supplement combination antiretroviral medication . Calcium Iron supplementation commonly use potential interact Dolutegravir ( DTG ) , study evaluate potential calcium iron supplement decrease DTG exposure . It also evaluate two possible strategy combine use ; interaction observe . The first strategy two hour separation . The second strategy involve administration DTG supplement meal since presence food modestly increase DTG exposure , mineral supplement administer food . This open label , randomize , two cohort , four-period cross-over study healthy volunteer . One cohort examine effect calcium carbonate cohort examine effect ferrous fumarate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) DTG . Approximately 12 subject enrol two cohort receive four treatment randomize fashion : 1 ) A single dose DTG 50 milligram ( mg ) administer fasted condition ; 2 ) A single dose DTG 50 mg co-administered single dose calcium carbonate ferrous fumarate fast condition ; 3 ) A single dose DTG 50 mg co-administered single dose calcium carbonate ferrous fumarate moderate-fat meal ; 4 ) A single dose DTG 50 mg administer fasted condition 2 hour prior administration single dose calcium carbonate ferrous fumarate . There washout period least 7 day treatment . Safety evaluations serial PK sample collect treatment period . A follow-up visit occur 7-14 day last dose study drug . This study conduct one center United States , healthy adult male female subject .</brief_summary>
