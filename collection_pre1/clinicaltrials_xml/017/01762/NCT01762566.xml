	<brief_summary>Aim investigator ' study evaluate one symptom describe patient affected so-called `` not-celiac wheat sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) . NCWS patient may define one , neither celiac allergic wheat , develop symptom follow wheat consumption improve Gluten Free Diet ( GFD ) . Among , patient often report appearance bloat abdominal pain , , sometimes , swell finger face , shortly ingestion wheat . They also refer swell tends last hour disappear GFD . To knowledge , disorder never investigate neither prove . For investigator ' research , investigator select adult patient , gender , affect NCWS . Diagnostic criterion include : 1 ) symptom disappearance GFD , 2 ) test negative celiac disease [ anti-tTG EMA , biopsy Marsh 0-1 ] wheat allergy [ serum specific IgE wheat ] , 3 ) positive response double-blind placebo-controlled challenge ( DBPC ) wheat placebo . Patients recruit among subject refer , outpatient , Department Internal Medicine , 'Giovanni Paolo II ' Hospital Sciacca ( Agrigento ) , Internal Medicine University Palermo , January 2012 October 2013 . The investigator include patient refer functional dyspepsia and/or irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) -like symptom . All recruit patient must report body 's swell immediately wheat ingestion . In recruited patient , NCWS diagnosis pose previous year , accord mention criterion . Patients , GFD least 30 day , undergo another DBPC wheat placebo ( xylose ) , perform administer capsule cod A B contain wheat xylose , respectively . Capsules A B administer , , 1 week washout , patient receive capsule , give . Before 2 hour every challenge , patient undergo complete medical examination ( measurement body weight , height , body mass index [ BMI ] , waist circumference , diameter thigh , leg , arm , finger ) , perform bioelectrical impedance analysis collect blood sampling , identification possible marker ( bioelectrical , immunologic , hormonal , etc ) may help demonstrate explain mechanism examine symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Not-celiac Wheat Sensitivity Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gluten important protein component grain , notably wheat , rye , barley , basis variety wheat-derived alimentary product consume throughout world ( bread , pasta , pizza etc ) . However `` engineering '' gluten-containing grain create condition human disease relate gluten exposure . These form gluten intolerance represent heterogeneous set condition , include celiac disease , wheat allergy gluten sensitivity , , combine , seem affect 10 % general population . The frequency not-celiac gluten sensitivity however still unknown , even though possible condition undiagnosed under-diagnosed physician long time . The immune responsiveness wheat antigens represent complex process , establishment maintenance completely elucidate . The frequent disease cause wheat ingestion T cell-mediated disorder , i.e . celiac disease immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) -mediated allergic reaction . However , besides celiac disease wheat allergy , case gluten reaction neither autoimmune IgE-mediated allergic mechanism involve . These generally define gluten sensitivity . Some subject , experience symptom eat gluten-containing product show improvement follow gluten-free diet , may gluten sensitivity instead celiac disease wheat allergy . Gluten sensitivity patient unable tolerate gluten develop adverse reaction eat gluten , , usually , differently celiac disease , lead small intestinal damage . Gastrointestinal symptom gluten sensitivity patient may resemble associated celiac disease , overall clinical picture generally less severe accompany occurrence autoantibody ( i.e . anti-tissue transglutaminase , tTG , anti-endomysium , EMA ) autoimmune disease ( i.e . Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ) . Typically , diagnosis make exclusion , elimination diet `` open challenge '' ( i.e. , monitor reintroduction gluten-containing food ) often use evaluate whether health improves worsen elimination reintroduction gluten diet , respectively . As known cereal component determine symptom call gluten sensitivity patient , prefer define condition `` wheat sensitivity '' instead `` gluten sensitivity '' . Wheat sensitivity cause gastrointestinal extra-intestinal symptom ; among latter , patient often report body 's swelling ( hand ' , finger ' , arm ' , face 's swell ) . This study two major aim : 1 . Evaluation effective dependence wheat ingestion clinical alteration present patient diagnosed gluten sensitivity , particular attention abdominal bloating body 's swelling . The study do period gluten-free diet ( least 30 day ) , use double-blind placebo-controlled challenge wheat placebo ( xylose ) , perform administer capsule cod A B contain wheat xylose , respectively . Capsules A B administer , , 1 week washout , patient receive capsule , give . 2 . Before 2 hour every challenge , patient undergo complete medical examination , The investigator perform bioelectrical impedance analysis collect blood sampling , identification possible marker may help demonstrate explain mechanism examine symptom .</detailed_description>
