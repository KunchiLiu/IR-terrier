	<brief_title>Sildenafil Cerebrovascular Dysfunction Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal Phase II study generate pilot data allow design clinical trial sildenafil ( Viagra® ) treat patient traumatic vascular injury chronic state traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Injury small medium-sized blood cerebral blood vessel well-recognized consequence traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Non-invasive image positron emission tomography ( PET ) single photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) long demonstrate deficit cerebral blood flow TBI , include symptomatic patient year mild TBI ( mTBI ) . Recently , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method develop allow reliable non-invasive measurement cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) vasodilatory stimuli hypercapnia human . These technique never apply symptomatic patient chronic stage mTBI . These method particularly promise due recent discovery phosphodiesterase-5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitor improve cerebral blood flow , induce angiogenesis neurogenesis , improve functional recovery animal experimental stroke cryoinjury . This pilot study use novel MRI method ( Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) response hypercapnia ) noninvasively measure cerebrovascular reactivity chronic stage TBI , first use sildenafil patient chronic TBI . The study one primary objective 10 secondary objective : Primary objective : 1 . Single dose treatment sildenafil ( 50 mg orally ) effective increase global BOLD response hypercapnia symptomatic patient chronic stage TBI . Secondary objective ( Safety Tolerability ) : 2 . Sildenafil therapy ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) well tolerate symptomatic patient chronic stage TBI , adverse effect treatment discontinuation less 10 % patient . Tertiary ( Exploratory ) objectives : 3 . Single dose treatment sildenafil ( 50 mg orally ) effective increase regional BOLD response hypercapnia symptomatic patient chronic stage TBI . 4 . Patients persistent symptom chronic stage TBI deficits cerebrovascular reactivity compare uninjured healthy control . 5 . Patients persistent symptom chronic stage TBI deficits cerebrovascular reactivity compare asymptomatic patient TBI . 6 . Patients persistent symptom chronic stage TBI reduce number circulate EPCs compare uninjured healthy control . 7 . Patients persistent symptom chronic stage TBI reduce number circulate EPCs compare asymptomatic patient TBI . 8 . The effect cerebrovascular reactivity single dose treatment sildenafil persist 8 week chronic therapy ( 25 mg orally , twice daily ) . 9 . Treatment sildenafil 8 week ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) increase number circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) symptomatic chronic TBI patient . 10 . Treatment sildenafil 8 week ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) reduce prevalence post-concussive symptom , compare placebo treatment . 11 . Treatment sildenafil 8 week ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) improve performance neuropsychometric test , compare placebo treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria apply participant In order include study , participant must meet follow minimum criterion : 1 . Age 18 55 year , inclusive 2 . Ability undergo MRI scanning . 3 . Ability read , write , speak English . 4 . Stable dos concomitant medication least 2 week prior enrollment . 5 . Likelihood complete 18 week study procedure . Likelihood ability complete study procedure mean person 1 ) low probability deploy 18week period 2 ) verbalizes intent complete study . Inclusion Criteria Group 1 ( symptomatic TBI ) In order include symptomatic TBI Group , study participant must meet following criterion : 1 . A history sustain TBI &gt; 6 month &lt; 10 year prior enrollment . Evidence one follow 3 criterion : 1 . GCS 3 12 ( GCS obtain Emergency Room note medical record ) 2 . Posttraumatic amnesia &gt; 24 hour 3 . TBIrelated abnormality neuroimaging ( either CT MRI ) . ( Some miss information initial injury ( i.e . documentation initial GCS ) necessarily exclusionary bulk available history indicative patient suffer TBI meet inclusion criterion ) 2 . Persistent postconcussive symptom , accord DSMIV Research Criteria PostConcussional Disorder , include : 1 . Evidence neuropsychological test difficulty attention memory . ( refers neuropsychological test do part patient 's hospital rehabilitation care part screen study ) 2 . Three follow symptom , start shortly trauma persist least three month : ) Fatigability ii ) Disordered sleep iii ) Headache iv ) Vertigo dizziness v ) Irritability aggression vi ) Anxiety , depression , affective instability vii ) Changes personality ( e.g . social sexual inappropriateness ) viii ) Apathy lack spontaneity c ) Symptoms criterion ( ) ( b ) must onset trauma , significant worsen preexist symptom trauma . ) Disturbance symptoms cause significant impairment social occupational functioning represent significant decline previous level functioning . Inclusion Criteria Group 2—Healthy control In order include study , participant must meet inclusion criterion participant list 4.2 . 3.2.3 Inclusion Criteria Group 3—Recovered TBI 1 . History sustain TBI &gt; 6 month &lt; 10 year prior enrollment . This evidence one following : ) GCS 3 12 ( GCS obtain Emergency Room injury note medical record ) b ) Posttraumatic amnesia &gt; 24 hour c ) TBIrelated abnormality neuroimaging ( either CT MRI ) 2 . Does meet criterion persistent postconcussive symptom , accord DSMIV Research Criteria Postconcussional Disorder define follow : 1 . No evidence neuropsychological test difficulty attention memory . 2 . No 1 follow symptom , start shortly trauma persists least three month : ) Fatigability ii ) Disordered sleep iii ) Headache iv ) Vertigo dizziness v ) Irritability aggression vi ) Anxiety , depression , affective instability vii ) Changes personality ( e.g . social sexual inappropriateness ) viii ) Apathy lack spontaneity c ) No impairment social occupational functioning significant decline previous level functioning . Exclusion Criteria Groups : 1 . Contraindication sildenafil include follow : 1 . Current use organic nitrate vasodilator 2. use ritonavir ( HIVprotease inhibitor ) 3 . Current use erythromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole 4 . Current use cimetidine 5 . Alphablockers doxazosin ( Cardura ) , tamsulosin ( Flomax ) , terazosin ( Hytrin ) prazosin ( Minipres ) . These medication usually use treatment enlarged prostate . 6 . Current rest hypotension ( BP &lt; 90/50 mm Hg ) 7 . Current severe renal insufficiency ( Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 mL/min ) 8 . Current hepatic cirrhosis 9 . Current cardiac failure coronary artery disease cause unstable angina 10 . Retinitis pigmentosa 11 . Known hypersensitivity allergy sildenafil component tablet 2 . Evidence penetrate injury 3 . Daily therapy PDE5 inhibitor within past 2 month 4 . History evidence preexist neurological psychiatric disorder relate TBI , : 1 . Multiple sclerosis , pre coexist 2 . Stroke ( stroke time TBI ) 3 . Preexisting developmental disorder 4 . Preexisting epilepsy 5 . Preexisting major depressive disorder 6 . Preexisting schizophrenia 5 . Women pregnant breastfeeding .
