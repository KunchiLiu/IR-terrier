	<brief_summary>The purpose study refine cantharidin-induced blister assay healthy volunteer model inflammatory disease . The study experimental trial healthy volunteer two part ; Part 1 optimise model Part 2 validate use two anti-inflammatory treatment different mode action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Methodology Study Validate Cantharidin Blister Model Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study refine cantharidin-induced blister assay . The cantharidin-induced skin blister assay may valuable tool evaluation pharmacodynamic effect novel anti-inflammatory drug healthy volunteer , particularly novel concept target neutrophilic monocytic inflammation . The study experimental trial healthy volunteer purpose evaluate variability ( subject within subject ) size content ( cellular fluid ) blister induce forearm direct application cantharidin . Specifically , aim ass whether variability reduce current study , cantharidin apply directly skin order minimise variation total skin exposure . Once experimental design optimise Part 2 study examine effect course anti-inflammatory treatment prior induction blister size and/or content blister single blind crossover protocol .</detailed_description>
