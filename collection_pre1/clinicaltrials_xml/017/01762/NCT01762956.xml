	<brief_summary>The pelvic floor disorder major problem current society manifestation micturition disorder , defecatory problem sexual dysfunction . The pelvic floor muscle train arouses interest due study subject . Studies conduct emphasis post-prostatectomy urinary disorder , however , associate radiotherapy . The study effect radiotherapy muscle still uncertain . At right , know effect radiation trigger important anatomical change could lead pelvic floor disorder manifest clinically defecatory urinary disorder . These issue motivate u research , focus evaluation muscle magnetic nuclear resonance consider radiation therapy increasingly use therapeutic option treatment prostate cancer . The primary objective verify effect pelvic floor muscle train ( PFMT ) tract symptom ( LUTS ) , anorectal sexual complaint men prostate cancer ( PCa ) treat radiotherapy ( RT ) . Secondly , objective evaluate effect PFMT function severity urinary incontinence ( UI ) evaluate quality life . The assessment change occur effect radiation separately jointly train pelvic floor muscle help u good understand dysfunction present sample patient well understand effect possible contribution training muscle treatment and/or prevention disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Muscles Training Men Undergoing Radiotherapy Prostate Cancer : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This present research randomize control clinical trial hold Clinics Hospital Medical School Ribeirão Preto - University São Paulo ( HCFMRP-USP ) include men confirm diagnosis prostate cancer biopsy clinical indication radiotherapy treatment ( RT ) follow-up HCFMRP-USP voluntarily consent participate research . After consent , patient must sign consent term allocate randomization one follow study group : - Training group ( TG ) : group patient undergo radiotherapy submit pelvic floor muscle train ; - Control group ( CG ) : group patient undergo radiotherapy . This research consist four assessment : ( 1 ) Assessment 01 : start radiotherapy ; ( 2 ) Assessment 02 : two week start RT ; ( 3 ) Assessment 03 : 03 month start RT ( 4 ) Assessment 04 : 06 month start RT . All assessment common participant research independently group belong . In assessment , image pelvic floor muscle acquire nuclear magnetic resonance . Parallel MRI , clinical assessment patient consist anamnesis physical examination , assessment pelvic floor muscle function test objectively use perineometer evaluate peak mean contraction well duration perform sustained contraction . Data collect three contraction , whose mean value use study . The myoelectric activity evaluate use electromyography biofeedback electromyography anal probe . The patient also answer quality life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 e PR25 ) others questionnaire : ICIQ-SF , QS-M Jorge-Wexner Scale . The patient TG include supervised training protocol pelvic floor muscle . This protocol conduct conjunction radiotherapy session . The supervised muscle training conduct week 45 minute session RT ( 12 week - 3 month ) . In addition supervise session , patient group instruct practice home exercise receive guidance booklet exercise explanation exercise perform . These exercise must perform daily write worksheet perform . After 3 month period , patient encourage continue exercise protocol home without supervision . They must attend monthly monitor adherence home exercise . The control group ( CG ) patient instruct perform pelvic floor exercise , instead assess within stipulated time .</detailed_description>
