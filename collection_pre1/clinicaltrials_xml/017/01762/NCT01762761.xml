	<brief_title>Eltrombopag Phase III Study In Chinese Chronic ITP Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind open-label phase III study aim determine efficacy , tolerance safety eltrombopag Chinese chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) adult subject . This study conduct Chinese adult chronic ITP subject respond relapsed previous treatment ITP , include first line therapy /or splenectomy . The primary objective study determine efficacy oral eltrombopag thrombopoietic agent treat previously treat chronic Chinese ITP patient compare placebo . The secondary objective ass safety tolerability eltrombopag administer 6 week previously treat adult chronic ITP patient compare placebo . In addition , long-term efficacy safety eltrombopag treatment also evaluate 24-week extension open-label phase double-blind phase one study objective . If subject benefit eltrombopag treatment base investigator 's discretion , subject continue eltrombopag treatment commercial launch eltrombopag China . Furthermore , understand pharmacokinetics ( PK ) profile eltrombopag explore relationship PK pharmacodynamics ( PD ) ( platelet response ) , PK/PD analysis embed phase III study conduct patient population participate phase III study . Approximately 150 eligible subject randomize either eltrombopag match placebo treatment 2:1 ratio stage 1 ( 8-week double blind stage ) . Randomization stage 1 stratify splenectomy status ( Yes/No ) , use concomitant maintenance ITP therapy ( Yes/No ) , baseline platelet count ( 15×109/L , &gt; 15×109/L ) . This study include 3 stage . The stage 1 8-week double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled treatment period . Following completion Stage 1 complete data clean initial 6 week , investigator un-blinded treatment assignment individual subject basis enable appropriate start dose selection stage 2 , 24-week open-label treatment period . PK sample assessment occur Week 2 visit stage 2 study , subject receive eltrombopag . After completion stage 2 , subject may continue eltrombopag treatment stage 3 , he/she benefit continuous eltrombopag treatment base investigator 's judgement . The initial dose eltrombopag administration 25 mg orally daily . During 8 week double-blind treatment , dose investigational product adjust accord weekly subject platelet count . The eligible subject complete stage 1 ( 8 week double-blind treatment period : first 6 week data use primary endpoint analysis last 2 week data clean period period blind treatment continue first 6 week ) would enter voluntary open-label stage 2 ( 24-week open-label extension phase ) subject eltrombopag group placebo group opportunity receive eltrombopag treatment . Subjects unwilling unqualified ( subject meet stop criterion ) participate extension treatment attend follow-up visit 4 week completion double-blind phase . During open-label stage 2 period eligible subject receive open label eltrombopag treatment . The dose eltrombopag continuously adjust accord subject 's platelet count . Following completion Stage 2 , subject benefit eltrombopag treatment base investigator 's discretion , subject voluntarily enter stage 3 , subject continue eltrombopag treatment commercial launch eltrombopag China .</detailed_description>
