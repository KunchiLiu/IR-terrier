	<brief_title>Sorafenib Combined With Chemotherapy Renal Collecting Duct Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Collecting duct carcinoma ( CDC ) kidney rare aggressive neoplasm distal collecting tubule establish treatment . Since histology collect duct carcinoma similar urothelial carcinoma , prospective phase II trial France ( 2007 ) study gemcitabine plus cisplatin first-line treatment advance CDC , result effective rate 26 % . The targeted drug produce definite efficacy renal clear cell carcinoma , data target drug treatment renal advance collect duct carcinoma limited . We sponsor study base assumption target drug combine chemotherapy produce additive , positive effect CDC .</detailed_description>
