	<brief_summary>Background : Cholera public health problem globally Bangladesh prevention important . Despite recent availability effective affordable oral cholera vaccine ( OCV ) , field application remain challenge need address carefully conduct research studies.There lack information temperature sensitivity result immunogenicity Shanchol OCV know administration two dos OCVs , one month apart , instead currently recommend 14 day , improve success vaccination programme effective ; also one dose vaccine , instead currently recommend two dos , would result adequate immune response population expose V. cholerae endemic country like Bangladesh . Objectives : To determine immunogenicity Shanchol adult . : 1. vaccine store three defined temperature ( 25 oC ,37 oC 42oC ) 14 day , put back cold box administration field compare response vaccine store currently recommend temperature . 2. two dos vaccine administer one month apart compare vaccine administer currently recommend interval 14 day . 3. single dose administer compare response recommend two dos . Methods : The study conduct among adult live Mirpur community urban Dhaka , capital Bangladesh.Studying safety acute long-term immune response period one year . Outcome measures/variables : 1 . Objective 1 : safety immunogenicity vaccine adult storage three defined temperature ( 25oC ,37oC 42oC ) measure vibriocidal antibody response compare finding vaccine store currently recommended temperature 2-8oC ( recommended manufacturer , Shantha Biotechnic ) . 2 . Objective 2 : compare vibriocidal response follow administration two dos vaccine one month apart compare vaccination 14 day apart period one year , study memory response one year period secondary outcome . 3 . Objective 3 : compare acute immune response ( vibriocidal antibody ) follow one two dos vaccine , compare memory response secondary outcome measure , one year period . The information need urgently develop effective vaccination strategy prevention control cholera endemic country .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholera remain major cause morbidity mortality Bangladesh many endemic country world.The WHO recommend use cholera vaccine epidemic endemic area control outbreaks.An affordable oral vaccine available use endemic setting ; however , successful vaccination remain challenge expensive due need temperature-controlled distribution system , difficult develop countries.Therefore , would important test heat stability current vaccine without significantly compromise safety efficacy . In cholera endemic population baseline immune response memory pathogen already exist . Therfore , single dose cholera vaccine could act booster dose eliminate need second dose , save cost importantly significantly improve delivery large number people within short time . However , need study endemic country , Bangladesh , examine acute memory response follow single dose determine long persist . In develop country Bangladesh , vaccination two dos problematic , logistic cost issue . It also difficult administer two dos vaccine interval 14 day - increase interval one month would practical would improve coverage large number population . It would , therefore , important examine immunogenicity could increase second dose administer 30 day follow first dose . Adult male females live Mirpur community urban Dhaka recruit study.The community inform field staff interested person recruit accord inclusion/exclusion criterion . Eligible participant receive Shanchol vaccine accord study design . The vaccine come single-dose vial 1.5 mL volume . Group 1 : Immunogenicity study temperature stability Shanchol The vaccine store different temperature 1a . 25°C 14 day 1b . 37°C 14 day 1c . 42°C 14 day . After vaccine store recommended tempature cold chain administration participant . The second dose administer 14 day first dose , currently recommend . These three group compare receive vaccine maintain standard condition 2-8oC.We enroll 145 participant four group ( three intervention control ) i.e . total 580 eligible participant . We measure acute response vaccine measure vibriocidal antibody period 28 day . Group 2a : Immunogenicity two dos Shanchol give 14 day apart immunogenicity measure one year period Two dos vaccine , maintain standard storage condition ( 2-8oC ) , administer 14 day apart evaluate acute long term immune responses.A total 145 eligible participant study group . We compare acute long term immune response among participant group Group 2b Group 3 . Group 2b : Immunogenicity two dos Shanchol give 30 day apart immunogenicity measure one year period Two dos vaccine , maintain standard storage condition ( 2-8oC ) , administer 30 day apart evaluate acute long term immune response . A total 145 eligible participant study group . We compare acute long term immune response group Group 2a Group 3 . Group 3 : Immunogenicity single dose Shanchol one year period A single dose vaccine , maintain standard temperature ( 2-8oC ) , administer . The acute long term immune response would measure one-year period . A total 145 participant enrol group . We compare immune response among particiupants group Groups 2a 2b . Duration study period individual participant The participant Group 1 follow upto 28 day , remain group follow 1 year . Surveillance adverse effect : The study participant monitor intervention ass safety study agent . After dose vaccine , recipient follow 30 minute clinic send home problem . Under supervision clinic physician , train Research Assistants visit participant respective home next 3 cosecutive day record adverse event diarrhea , vomit , nausea local systemic reaction constitute active surveillance . For next 11 day , passive surveillance carry participant instructed visit field clinic problem . All adverse event study period record condition manage either clinic Dhaka Hospital icddr , b clinics/hospitals depend nature severity condition cost participant . A clinical record form use record clinical sign symptom . For serious adverse event data enter onto separate form . Study intervention : Oral cholera vaccine , Shanchol Each dose vaccine contains inactivated whole cell , heat kill formalin kill bacteria measure ELISA Units ( EU ) lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . It contain formalin-killed V. cholerae Inaba , El Tor biotype ( strain Phil 6973 ; 600 EU ) ; heat-killed V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype ( Cairo 50 ; 300 EU ) ; formalin kill V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype ( Cairo 50 ; 300 EU ) ; LPS heat-killed V. cholerae Inaba , classical biotype ( Cairo 48 ; 300 EU ) ; formalin kill V. cholerae O139 ( 4260B ; 600 EU ) . Storage condition The vaccine store 2-8°C standard condition ( recommend ) incubator 25°C , 37 °C 42°C 14 day study purpose . Vaccine allocation : The study open study although investigator laboratory carry test blind batch vaccine allocation test . The vaccine allocate base temperature incubate start low 25 oC go finally 42oC different set study participant . Each set vaccine store different temperature give code ( 25oC , 37oC 42oC stored batch ) .</detailed_description>
