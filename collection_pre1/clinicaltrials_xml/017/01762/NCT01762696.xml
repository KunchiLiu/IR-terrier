	<brief_title>A Real-time , Contextual Intervention Using Mobile Technology Reduce Marijuana Use Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose pilot randomize trial develop test Momentary Self-Monitoring Feedback + Motivational Enhancement Therapy ( MOMENT ) intervention , real-time , contextual intervention reduce marijuana use three month 15-to-24-year-old primary care patient use frequently . We randomize youth one two arm ( goal 30 per arm complete 3-month follow-up ) : 1 ) MOMENT ( MET + momentary self-monitoring + context-dependent feedback ) , 2 ) MET-only . The two study arm permit evaluation contribution self-monitoring feedback component intervention above-and-beyond MET directly test influence intervention link momentary context marijuana-related outcome . The specific aim study Specific Aim 1 : Continued Feasibility Evaluation . In preliminary work , demonstrate 1 ) youth perceive MOMENT easy understand , comfortable , motivating , helpful reduce marijuana use , 2 ) recruit 4 participants/month ( minimum rate propose study ) , 3 ) successfully implement MOMENT intervention study propose recruitment site . Based work , identify additional area feasibility focus propose study . Specifically , aim achieve : 1a . A signal response rate least 70 % three period momentary data collection - baseline , intervention , 3-month follow-up . 1b . A diary response rate least 70 % momentary data collection period 1. c. A retention rate least 80 % participant 3-month follow-up . Specific Aim 2 . Early-Stage Efficacy Exploration . Our preliminary work show momentary individual-level outcome improve baseline three month post-intervention . The primary momentary outcome desire use marijuana trigger context likelihood use follow exposure trigger context . The primary individual-level outcome number use events/week , 30-day percent day abstinent , dose/use event , measure motivation ( importance , readiness , confidence reduce use ) . Based preliminary finding , explore early-stage efficacy question : 2. . Will improvements momentary outcome observe MOMENT , MET-only ? ( 1 ) The association exposure self-identified trigger context momentary desire use marijuana attenuate three month , compare pre-intervention . ( 2 ) The likelihood marijuana use follow exposure trigger context reduce three month . 2b . Will improvements individual-level outcome great MOMENT vs. MET-only ? 1 . The reduction marijuana use frequency ( events/week 30-day percent day abstinent ) dose ( per use event ) great three month . 2 . The increase motivation reduce discontinue use great three month .</detailed_description>
