	<brief_summary>The aim investigator ' study evaluate biochemical , immunological histological characteristic patient affect so-called `` gluten ( wheat ) sensitivity '' suffers irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) -like symptom . As known component cereal cause symptom call `` gluten-sensitive '' patient , investigator prefer speak `` not-celiac wheat sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) . NCWS patient may define one , neither celiac allergic wheat , develop symptom follow wheat consumption , improve wheat/gluten free diet ( GFD ) . For research , select adult patient , gender , affect suspect NCWS ( i.e . symptoms/signs disappear GFD worsen gluten contain diet , test negative celiac disease [ anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody , anti-tTG , anti-endomysium antibody , EMA , biopsy Marsh 0-1 ] wheat allergy [ serum specific IgE wheat ] ) . The patient recruit Department Internal Medicine , 'Giovanni Paolo II ' Hospital Sciacca ( Agrigento ) , Internal Medicine University Palermo , January 2012 October 2013 , IBS-like symptom . At time recruitment , patient GFD least one month must asymptomatic . A restricted elimination diet ( exclusion cow 's milk , egg food ) could prescribe patient suspect suffer multiple food hypersensitivity . The patient randomize undergo double-blind placebo-controlled study , assume wheat flour placebo , administer daily 15 day . Before challenge , investigator evaluate gastrointestinal ( Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale , GSRS ) investigator collect blood sample biopsy endoscopic evaluation ( esophagogastroduodenoscopy rectoscopy , multiple biopsy ) , identification possible marker ( serological , biochemical , immunological , histological feature , expression cytokine constitutive mucosal proteins peripheral blood mononuclear cell mucosal lymphocyte ) may help diagnose condition NCWS understand pathogenesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bio-markers Not-celiac Wheat Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gluten important protein component grain , notably wheat , rye , barley , basis variety wheat-derived alimentary product consume throughout world ( bread , pasta , pizza etc ) . However `` engineering '' gluten-containing grain create condition human disease relate gluten exposure . These form gluten intolerance represent heterogeneous set condition , include celiac disease , wheat allergy gluten sensitivity ( GS ) , , combine , seem affect 10 % general population . The frequency not-celiac GS however still unknown , even though possible condition undiagnosed under-diagnosed physician long time . The immune responsiveness wheat antigens represent complex process , establishment maintenance completely elucidate . The frequent disease cause wheat ingestion T cell-mediated disorder , i.e . celiac disease IgE-mediated allergic reaction . However , besides celiac disease wheat allergy , case gluten reaction neither autoimmune IgE-mediated allergic mechanism involve . These generally define GS . Some subject , experience symptom eat gluten-containing product show improvement follow gluten-free diet ( GFD ) , may GS instead celiac disease wheat allergy . GS patient unable tolerate gluten develop adverse reaction eat gluten , , usually , differently celiac disease , lead small intestinal damage . Gastrointestinal symptom GS patient may resemble associated celiac disease , overall clinical picture generally less severe accompany occurrence autoantibody ( i.e . anti-tTG EMA ) autoimmune disease ( i.e . Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ) . Typically , diagnosis make exclusion , elimination diet `` open challenge '' ( i.e. , monitor reintroduction gluten-containing food ) often use evaluate whether health improves worsen elimination reintroduction gluten diet , respectively . Gluten-sensitivity cause gastrointestinal extra-intestinal symptom ; among former , frequent IBS-like symptom include abdominal pain , bloating , diarrhea , constipation alternate bowel habit . However , know component cereal cause symptom call `` gluten-sensitive '' patient , prefer speak `` Not-celiac wheat sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) . Furthermore , experience , NCWS patient suffer multiple food hypersensitivity need restrict diet elimination cow 's milk , egg food , addition wheat . For reason , undergo gluten challenge , patient undergo oligoantigenic diet . This study two major aim : 1 . Evaluation effective dependence wheat IBS-like manifestation present subject suspect GS . The study do period GFD , compare two group suspect NCWS subject : administer wheat flour placebo ( 15 day ) . 2 . Identification possible marker ( serological , biochemical , immunological , histological feature , expression cytokine constitutive mucosal proteins peripheral blood mononuclear cell mucosal lymphocyte ) may help diagnose condition NCWS . In particular , investigator search marker NCWS colon mucosa patient IBS-like symptom .</detailed_description>
