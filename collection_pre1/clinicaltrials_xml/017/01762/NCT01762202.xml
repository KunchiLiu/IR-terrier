	<brief_title>Assessment Efficacy Safety Front-line Fludarabine , Cyclophoshamide Ofatumumab Chemoimmunotherapy Young Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given : - rituximab , fludarabine cyclophosphamide ( FCR ) front-line treatment associate high OR rate , superior PFS OS compare fludarabine cyclophosphamide regimen ; - direct relationship dose rituximab response rate report ; - ofatumumab , single agent , prove activity CLL patient refractory disease ; - ofatumumab , fludarabine cylophosphamide ( O-FC ) front-line treatment associate high complete response ( CR ) rate ; - expect grade 3-4 granulocytopenia could lead reduce dose intensity study drug ( FC ) increase infection rate ; schedule combine FC increase dose ofatumumab associate primary phrophylaxis granulocytopenia could associate improvement CR rate . The purpose study determine whether could improve CR rate golden standard treatment fit patient CLL , FCR regimen , chemoimmunotherapy include FC combine increase dose monoclonal antibody ofatumumab , give every week ( FCO2 ) associate primary prophylaxis granulocytopenia .</detailed_description>
