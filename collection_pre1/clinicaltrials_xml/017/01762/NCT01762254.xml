	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Trial Incisionless Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Colectomy Left-sided Colonic Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For left-sided colorectal cancer , investigator perform colectomy primary anatomosis . Currently investigator two method minimal access approach abdominal cavity order complete operation : 1 . Conventional Laparoscopic colectomy The operation complete laparoscopic instrument use video laparoscopy . At end procedure , pneumoperitoneum abolish small wound create delivery bowel insertion anvil circular stapler . Finally , pneumoperitoneum re-created intra-corporeal anastomosis 2 . Incisionless Laparoscopic Colectomy Laparoscopic colectomy perform manner conventional laparoscopic colectomy , except end procedure , Transanal Endoscopic Operation ( TEO ) device outer diameter 4cm inserted anus delivery specimen insertion anvil instead create small wound conventional laparoscopic colectomy . Finally , intra-corporeal anastomosis perform manner TEO device remove . These two operation essentially identical except surgical access delivery specimen insertion anvil . Laparoscopic colectomy use Transanal Endoscopic Operation ( TEO ) device practice United States Europe 10 year . Large scale study literature demonstrate safety benefit laparoscopic colectomy colonic tumor oncological outcome show inferior open approach . With use TEO device , investigator perform laparoscopic colectomy without abdominal incision early left-sided colonic tumor thus eliminate wound-related complication theoretically . In order find one good procedure , investigator carry clinical trial compare two surgical option short-term long term outcomes.The result study may impact care similar patient future .</detailed_description>

Patient consider unfit operative treatment ; 3 . Patient present acute surgical emergency , include intestinal obstruction , peritonitis , pericolic abscess , etc . ; 4 .
