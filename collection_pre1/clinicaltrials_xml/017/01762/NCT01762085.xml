	<brief_summary>Anecdotal report scientific literature suggest risk recurrence diabetic foot ulcer minimize nerve decompression procedure anatomic site nerve pinch entrapment . Historical risk 25 % annually report decrease &gt; 80 % 5 % yearly . Since open wound precedes large majority ( 85 % ) amputation diabetes , avoidance ulcer recurrence important . This study test current academic opinion nerve decompression decrease ulcer recurrence risk . Null hypothesis : nerve decompression decrease diabetic foot ulcer recurrence risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes patient recently heal , non-ischemic plantar diabetic foot ulcer randomize `` best care '' standard post-ulcer treatment best care plus bilateral nerve decompression external neurolysis 4 fibro-osseous tunnel sit leg foot . Comparison control group standard care surgical intervention group make subsequent appearance plantar foot ulcer ulcer recurrence risk calculate . Additional subjective objective secondary outcome monitor . Null hypothesis : nerve decompression decrease diabetic foot ulcer recurrence risk . If protection ulcer occurrence confirm , change treatment paradigm diabetic neuropathy foot ulcer could appropriate .</detailed_description>
