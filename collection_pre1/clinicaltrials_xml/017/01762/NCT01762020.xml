	<detailed_description>Rationale Radiation dermatitis common problem significant proportion breast cancer patient . In addition , radiation dermatitis quantifiable complication relatively easily observe grade accord modify Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) criteria toxicity . Radiation dermatitis think related abrasion degrades keratinize skin surface . This result decrease ability skin stem cell regenerate lead moist desquamation . A barrier film could potentially form protective scaffold new skin growth repair . Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film ( BF ) show randomized trial involve post-mastectomy radiation patient reduce duration frequency radiation-induced moist desquamation . However , treatment study statistically prevalent situation intact breast . Therefore , propose investigate Cavilon reduce side-effects radiation treatment intact breast cancer patient treat conservative surgery adjuvant radiation therapy . 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives To evaluate effectiveness prevent Grade II great radiation dermatitis induce adjuvant radiation therapy woman breast cancer . The grade dermatitis obtain accord modify RTOG scale visual assessment radiation-induced skin erythema . This attached Appendix A . In addition , Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool ( STAT ) also use patient physician validate quality life tool toxicity tools . This attached Appendix B . 2.2 Secondary Objectives Quality Life The European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) use measure overall quality life . Quality life consider important contributor overall performance status outcome . Quality life consist multiple component ( e.g . physical , social , psychological aspect , etc. ) . Improved quality life translates well outcomes , especially context palliation . Global quality life find significantly associate survival general population cancer patient Canada . In fact , many clinical trial palliative care include improve quality life cancer patient primary outcome . The EORTC Quality Life Questionnaire ( QLQ-C30 ) develop Europe frequently use measure quality life related component . The EORTC QLQ C-30 attach appendix C. Time develop radiation dermatitis On follow visit , patient assess development grade radiation dermatitis . The time develop grade I , II grade III radiation dermatitis calculate date first dose radiation therapy deliver date visit grade dermatitis observe . Time additional treatment , i.e . over-the-counter prescription intervention , also measure . Image An observer , blind region treat Cavilon , also grade paired photographic image . Qualitative Questions Qualitative question mean ask personal opinion perspective . The answer provide insight related issue question . We design simple approach 2-3 open-ended question patient practitioner . See Appendix D. 3.0 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1 Study Design Randomized pair comparison design , conduct single centre , London Regional Cancer Program ( LRCP ) , Ontario , Canada . A total 47 patient accrue study . Eligible patient contact study detail review . The schedule BF two time per week throughout duration radiation therapy . Each BF treatment apply immediately radiation treatment radiation therapist use film template . The template cellophane sheet two quadrant physically remove . The quadrant remove randomly select receive film spray treatment . The template use time BF application . Other quadrant may receive standard treatment . No placebo use . To ensure template place correct location treatment , localization use permanent tattoo use radiation treatment localization . This intention-to-treat trial . 3.1.1 Baseline/Accrual ( Visit 1 ) Patients histopathologically cytologically confirm diagnosis breast cancer schedule receive adjuvant radiation therapy may screen . The following procedures/assessments take place visit patient : - Obtaining write informed consent - Reviewing inclusion/exclusion criterion - Obtaining disease history , include date first diagnosis , history course patient 's histopathologically cytologically confirm diagnosis breast cancer , information prior radiation chemotherapy - Obtaining medical history ( past concurrent clinically significant disease ( ) ) - Obtaining demographic data include history radiation sensitivity radiation sensitizer - Obtaining information plan treatment - Perform general physical examination - A patient meet eligibility criterion enrol study follow additional procedure perform : - Completion questionnaire STAT , modify RTOG visual assessment erythema , qualitative questionnaire QLQ-C30 - Assign two four region random number list 3.1.2 Treatment Phase ( Weekly assessment ) After Baseline visit , patient return study site schedule follow-up visit , also call Patient Review ( PR ) . The following procedures/assessments perform visit : - Evaluation documentation grade radiation dermatitis use STAT modify RTOG erythema scale - Documentation new medication use include use skin cream 3.1.3 Follow-up Visit ( One week post treatment completion ) The following procedures/assessments perform follow-up visit : - Evaluation documentation grade radiation dermatitis - Completion questionnaire QLQ-C30 - Completion qualitative question - Completion global questionnaire 4.0 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION The study conduct patient histopathologically cytologically confirm diagnosis breast cancer , schedule receive adjuvant radiation therapy outpatient London Health Sciences Centre , London , Ontario . 5.0 STATISTICAL EVALUATION 5.1 Determination Sample Size The primary endpoint comparison region 1 ( region treat standard care ) region 2 ( region treat BF ) . Based endpoint measure , estimate baseline/standard care risk grade 2 toxicity higher approximately 60 % point assessment period . Studies similar product demonstrate expect reduction grade 2 high toxicity approximately 30 % . This also clinically important significant difference . The sample size require 42 ( pair analysis ) . This assume Type I error 0.05 power 80 % reject null hypothesis . With expect 5 % excess add due loss follow non-evaluable data , would require sample size 47 patient . This consistent landmark Uppsala randomize study demonstrate value corticosteroid cream 42 patient . 5.2 Statistical Analysis SAS ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) use generate random allocation list two stratification block ( i. chemo chemo ; ii . breast separation ) .The physician unaware treatment allocation , patient radiation therapist administer film blind . For qualitative measure , McNemar 's ( McNemar ) chi-square test pair proportion use . For quantitative measure , pair t-test sign rank test use . For 'time event ' variable pair , Kaplan Meier estimate graphically demonstrate 'time event ' use . The statistical comparison perform use proportional hazard model sandwich estimator account pair sandwich estimator . A repeated measure ANOVA use assess four quadrant . If data poorly distribute take median two treat area two control area apply sing rank test . Note principle endpoint trial . The principle endpoint trial 1-to-1 comparison BF treat area area treat use standard option . A multivariable analysis perform determine factor impact skin toxicity . The multivariable analysis use patient comparison difference account pair . All significant test two-sided performed 5 % level .</detailed_description>
