	<brief_title>Evaluating Control COPD Symptoms Patients Treated With Tiotropium Bromide 18mcg Once Daily Alone , ADOAIR 50/250mcg Twice Daily Alone ADOAIR 50/250mcg Plus Tiotropium Bromide 18mcg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SUMMARY Rationale Both ADOAIR tiotropium bromide ( hereinafter tiotropium）are well establish , effective treatment COPD frequently co-prescribed ( hereinafter TRIPLE therapy ) . The addition ADOAIR tiotropium improve lung function quality life may reduce exacerbation . GOLD 2011 thus recommend TRIPLE therapy second choice COPD treatment strategy . However , criterion switch individual treatment TRIPLE therapy clearly show far . This study conduct Japanese subject COPD ass whether GOLD 2011 strategy effective medical practice Japan . Objective ( ) The objective study ass control COPD use symptom exacerbation risk base treatment strategy base GOLD 2011 . Study Design Multicenter , randomize , double-dummy , 24-weeks , observational study Study Endpoints/Assessments Primary - Proportion patient able remain randomized therapy Secondary - Proportion patient switch TRIPLE therapy - Proportion patient control TRIPLE therapy - Proportion patient control randomized therapy plus TRIPLE therapy - Time switch TRIPLE therapy - Time first exacerbation - Proportion diagnose exacerbation confirm Daily Record Card - Proportion exacerbation detect Daily Record Card diagnose - CAT score change - Change FEV1 - Use relief medication - Proportion patient decrease treatment TRIPLE therapy - Proportion patient require additional treatment TRIPLE therapy - Proportion patient drop - Patients ' judgment treatment efficacy - Physician 's judgment treatment efficacy Safety - Adverse event report - Exacerbations COPD</detailed_description>
