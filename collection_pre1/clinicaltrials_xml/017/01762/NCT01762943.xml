	<detailed_description>Affective disorder , postpartum depression ( PPD ) reproductive-related mood disorder , common constitute significant burden woman , child , society . However , little known neurobiological mechanism underlie depressive disorder woman . The long-term goal research 1 ) advance understand biological mechanism underlie trigger susceptibility depressive disorder woman ; 2 ) permit prediction risk PPD . The objective current project examine whether past episode PPD ( `` high risk '' recurrence ) show differences emotional arousal reward processing domain relative healthy control woman ( without history PPD ) baseline hormone withdrawal-precipitated condition . The central hypothesis reproductive hormone change associate dysregulation neural circuit underlie emotional arousal reward processing consequent depressive symptom high-risk woman . The rationale propose study employ scale model puerperal hormonal event high-risk woman permit identification group individual homogeneous reproductive relate affective dysfunction , hence , best opportunity disentangle specific change brain function due reproductive hormone accompany reproductive hormone-precipitated affective dysfunction . Moreover , identify neurophysiologic biomarker hormone-related affective dysfunction provide clear pathway examine mechanism susceptibility affective dysfunction across disorder . The investigator plan accomplish objective application pursue follow specific aim : 1 ) ass effect simulate postpartum reproductive hormone withdrawal , compare baseline , corticolimbic circuit activation high-risk control woman ; 2 ) examine effect reproductive hormone withdrawal , compare baseline , reward circuit activation high-risk control woman . An additional exploratory aim identify neural biomarker , characterize corticolimbic reward circuit dysfunction , use predict onset PPD . The propose study involve experimentally manipulating reproductive hormone euthymic woman create scale version change occur puerperium . This endocrine manipulation paradigm use examine neurocircuitry underlie regulation affect reward processing baseline hormone withdrawal-precipitated condition among woman expect experience hormone-related affective dysregulation ( n=15 ) control ( n=15 ) . In short , investigator expect relative baseline , high-risk woman show great dysregulation neural circuit responsible emotion process reward process hormone withdrawal low-risk control woman . The expected outcome research identification neural circuit underlie susceptibility mediation hormone-related affective dysfunction . Understanding neurobiological mechanism subsequently improve ability identify risk PPD , may strengthen prevention effort ultimately prevent deleterious effect maternal depression offspring .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Group 1 : Women history postpartum depression 1 . A history major depression episode occur within two month childbirth ( determined SCID interview ) remit least one year prior enrollment study ; 2. well minimum one year ; 3. regular menstrual cycle least three month ; 4. age 2250 ; 5. pregnant , lactate good medical health ; 6. medication free ( include birth control pill ; participant may opt temporarily discontinue birth control pill participate ) ; 7. history puerperal suicide attempt psychotic episode require hospitalization . Group 2 : Healthy Controls 1 ) Controls meet inclusion criterion specify except must past present Axis I diagnosis evidence menstrually related mood disorder . A structured clinical interview ( SCID ) administer woman prior study entry . Any woman current axis I psychiatric diagnosis exclude participate protocol . Patients permit enter protocol important clinical laboratory abnormality include follow : current axis I psychiatric diagnosis endometriosis ; undiagnosed enlargement ovary ; liver disease ; breast cancer ; history blood clot legs lung ; undiagnosed vaginal bleeding ; porphyria ; diabetes mellitus ; malignant melanoma ; gallbladder pancreatic disease ; heart kidney disease ; cerebrovascular disease ( stroke ) ; cigarette smoking ; history suicide attempt psychotic episode require hospitalization ; recurrent migraine headache ; pregnancy ( patient warn become pregnant study require agree employ barrier contraceptive method ) ; pregnancyrelated medical condition hyperemesis , pretoxemia toxemia , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) bleed diathesis ; Any woman first degree relative ( immediate family ) either ovarian cancer , premenopausal breast cancer breast cancer present breast woman multiple family member ( great three relative ) postmenopausal breast cancer also exclude participate protocol ; Any woman meeting Stages Reproductive Aging Workshop Criteria ( STRAW ) perimenopause exclude participation . Specifically , exclude woman elevate plasma follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level ( &gt; 14 IU/L ) menstrual cycle variability &gt; 7 day different normal cycle length .</criteria>
