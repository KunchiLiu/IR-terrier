	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I/II trial study side effect best dose brentuximab vedotin give together combination chemotherapy see well work treat patient stage II-IV human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -associated Hodgkin lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , brentuximab vedotin , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vinblastine sulfate , dacarbazine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving brentuximab vedotin together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage II-IV HIV-Associated Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I . To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) brentuximab vedotin combine doxorubicin hydrochloride , vinblastine sulfate , dacarbazine ( AVD ) chemotherapy regimen treatment HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma . ( Phase I ) II . Establish estimate two-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) participants HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma treat use brentuximab vedotin plus AVD chemotherapy regimen . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity AVD brentuximab vedotin highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . II . To estimate partial response ( PR ) rate , complete response ( CR ) rate , overall survival ( OS ) , event free survival ( EFS ) 2 5 year . III . To evaluate effect AVD brentuximab vedotin cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4 CD8 count cycle 1 , 4 , end therapy , every 3 month treatment completion one year . IV . To investigate prognostic value fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan baseline , cycle 2 , treatment completion , respect 2-year progression free survival . V. To evaluate HAART status baseline correlate tumor response therapy OS PFS . VI . To characterize histologic subtypes HIV-Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) era . VII . To assess neurotoxicity HAART combination AVD brentuximab vedotin . VIII . To evaluate effect AVD brentuximab vedotin viral load cycle 1 , 4 , completion therapy , every 3 month treatment completion one year . IX . To perform pharmacokinetic immunogenicity study determine drug level therapy . X . To perform micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) profile analysis HIV-HL tumor specimen correlate miRNA expression OS , PFS , tumor response therapy , histologic subtype HIV-HL , HIV disease characteristic . XI . To perform tissue microarray analysis HIV-HL tumor specimen correlate marker study OS , PFS , tumor response therapy . XII . To identify Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -associated tumor derive deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) plasma study participant correlate level therapy disease response OS . ( Phase II ) XIII . To identify cytokine plasma participant therapy use tumor prognostic marker . ( Phase II ) XIV . To assess latent express HIV reservoir , , post chemotherapy . To understand cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent affect HIV expression . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study brentuximab vedotin follow phase II study . Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) , vinblastine sulfate IV , dacarbazine IV day 1 15 . Patients also receive brentuximab vedotin IV 30 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
