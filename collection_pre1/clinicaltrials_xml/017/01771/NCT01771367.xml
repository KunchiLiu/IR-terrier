	<brief_summary>It think vaccine trigger innate inflammatory response induce antigen-specific adaptive immunity ( desired effect ) , excessive inflammation may lead serious inflammatory complication unwanted side effect . Currently lack reliable biomarkers ( measurable biological response predict something ) able predict severe inflammation result development several vaccine terminate withdrawal license vaccine associate inflammatory complication . This study part BIOVACSAFE project 5-year 30 million Euro project fund Innovative Medicines Initiative . The project involve series clinical study use licensed vaccine benchmark generate clinical data inflammation identify biomarkers use predict acceptable reactogenicity . The target identify biomarkers predict occurrence beneficial detrimental effect response vaccine . Such biomarkers could use future vaccine development program optimise selection vaccine candidate profile unlikely generate worrisome safety signal generalise use . This study one series `` training '' study use different license vaccine prototypical representative class vaccine use particular population . Forty-eight subject randomise three group receive : ) Fluad ( n=20 ) , b ) Agrippal ( n=20 ) , c ) saline placebo ( n=8 ) . Following screen visit , participant undergo seven-day residential visit include immunisation intensive monitoring physiological ( e.g . heart rate , oral temperature , blood pressure ) metabolic immune ( innate adaptive ) parameter . This visit follow four outpatient visit monitor blood sample .</brief_summary>
