	<brief_summary>It think vaccine trigger innate inflammatory response induce antigenspecific adaptive immunity ( desired effect ) , excessive inflammation may lead serious inflammatory complication unwanted side effect . Currently lack reliable biomarkers ( measurable biological response predict something ) able predict severe inflammation result development several vaccine terminate withdrawal license vaccine associate inflammatory complication . This study part BIOVACSAFE project 5year €30M project fund Innovative Medicine Initiative . The project involve series clinical study use licensed vaccine benchmark generate clinical data inflammation identify biomarkers use predict acceptable reactogenicity . The target identify biomarkers predict occurrence beneficial detrimental effect response vaccine . Such biomarkers could use future vaccine development program optimize selection vaccine candidate profile unlikely generate worrisome safety signal generalize use . This study one series `` training '' study use different license vaccine prototypical representative class vaccine use particular target population . Twenty four subject randomise two group receive : A ) Engerix B vaccine ( n = 20 ) , B ) Saline placebo ( n = 4 ) . Following screen visit , participant undergo two immunisation month 0 month 6 . Each immunisation occur seven day residential visit include immunization intensive monitoring physiological ( e.g . heart rate , oral temperature , blood pressure ) metabolic immune ( innate adaptive ) parameter . Both residential visit follow four outpatient visit monitor blood sample .</brief_summary>
