	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct randomize control trial 200 overweight/obese pregnant woman offspring . The prenatal intervention emphasize improve diet physical activity . The lifestyle intervention deliver within empowerment theoretical framework combination group session , individual counseling , monitor compliance diet physical activity tailor intervention . The post-partum intervention session include mother offspring focus breastfeeding , improve physical activity quality diet feeding practice first post-partum year . As part routine prenatal care , participant control intervention arm give health-related advice . Since majority participant expect eligible Women , Infants Children ( WIC ) program , group also receive assistance WIC per routine policy . Our primary outcome Gestational Weight Gain ( GWG ) . The major secondary outcome interest infant BMI z-score 12 month age , investigator also evaluate several metabolic outcome mother infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity hyperglycemia pregnancy think impact fetal growth over-nutrition may stress fetal pancreas increase demand insulin . Such intrauterine program event affect birth weight raise offspring 's risk trajectory future obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease premature death . Investigators propose conduct randomize control trial 200 overweight obese pregnant Puerto Rican woman ( free diabetes ) infant , favorably impact metabolic health mother infant . Women present randomized lifestyle modification intervention standard care control group 16 gestational week . The intervention focus improving : ( 1 ) physical activity level ( 2 ) diet quality calorie intake . The lifestyle intervention deliver within empowerment theoretical framework individualize intervention session , intensive group session , phone call . The intervention continue first postpartum year include infant . A key objective evaluate whether intervention optimize infant BMI z-score . We also evaluate whether intervention increase number woman experience appropriate gestational weight gain , evaluate several additional aim include relate intervention improve insulin sensitivity beta-cell function woman , insulin concentration adjust glucose infants.This study also help u identify overcome barrier develop effective way intervene pregnancy meaningfully improve cardio-metabolic risk trajectory future generation .</detailed_description>
