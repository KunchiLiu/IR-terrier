	<brief_summary>The primary objective characterization RAS peptide profile single repeat oral administration renin inhibitor , ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker healthy volunteer . Secondary objective correlation RAS peptide profile pharmacokinetic profile different RAS inhibitor pharmacodynamic parameter blood pressure heart rate . Output classic RAS system assess use aldosterone concentration . Fluid sodium intake monitor use sodium concentration total volume 24h urine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAS-Peptide-Profile Study Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The result pilot study show single dos different RAS inhibitor produce characteristic change RAS peptide profile . In first step find need verify large number healthy subject . Since unknown , whether change observe within hour single inhibitor dose stable time , profile also need investigated steady-state condition different inhibitor . Comparison RAS peptide profile single dose steady-state condition also allow detect whether peptide profile alter compensatory mechanism .</detailed_description>
