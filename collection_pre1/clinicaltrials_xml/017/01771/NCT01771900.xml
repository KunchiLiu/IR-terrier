	<brief_summary>The purpose feasibility study obtain pilot data , basis future , large investigation , test impact innovative training camp intervention call HEART CAMP ( Heart failure Exercise And Resistance Training CAMP ) teach HF patient exercise self-manage exercise behavior time . The study assess feasibility adequacy intervention , data collection plan , reliability sensitivity outcome measure . The 6-month intervention base training camp model teach HF patient exercise fun , group-oriented atmosphere . Subjects interact exercise small group exercise physiologist nurse guide activity . The dosage intervention ( frequency amount direct guidance exercise physiologist nurse ) decrease 6 month order increase subject 's independence promote long-term adherence exercise . The intervention incorporate use computerize data file monitor exercise behavior , compare exercise performance individualize goal provide feedback strategy foster adherence self-management exercise behavior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study use experimental repeated measure design randomize comparison HEART CAMP intervention group attention control group . The purpose feasibility study obtain pilot data , basis future , large investigation , test impact innovative 24-week ( 6-month ) training camp intervention ( HEART CAMP ) . HEART CAMP design teach heart failure ( HF ) patient exercise ( aerobic resistance ) self-manage exercise behavior time . Patients receive care BryanLGH Heart Institute heart failure clinic eligible study . The HEART CAMP intervention multi-component intervention derive Bandura 's cognitive behavioral theory consist specific strategy build self-efficacy exercise . The subject , guidance exercise physiologist nurse , taught exercise ( aerobic resistance ) . A baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test complete subject . The first three week HEART CAMP hold hospital base cardiac rehabilitation department subject electrocardiographically monitor five-day per week training session . Training session deliver cohort group eight subject focus exercise , self-evaluation response exercise , group debrief session problem solve relapse management . Weeks 4 12 subject complete three aerobic exercise session cardiac rehabilitation maintenance facility two resistive training session home exercise physiologist nurse monitor subject response deliver group debrief session week . Weeks 12 24 subject exercise independently exercise physiologist nurse monitoring subject exercise data available need . The attention control group receive weekly cohort group education session first 3 month similar intervention group ' participation weekly group session . One week educational topic present subsequent week cohort group eight subject discuss topic . Six topic present include : Eating Fruits , Vegetables , Grains ; Shopping Wisely ; Cooking Healthy ; Time Management ; Communicating Assertively ; Learning Relax . Outcome measure complete baseline , 3 week , 3 6 month ( end study ) group . Primary outcomes estimate energy expenditure , self-efficacy exercise , adherence exercise . Secondary outcome symptom , biomarker ( BNP ) , physical psychological functioning quality life</detailed_description>
