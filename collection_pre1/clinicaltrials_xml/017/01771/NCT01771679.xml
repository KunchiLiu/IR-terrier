	<brief_title>Safety Study Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells Patients With Cutaneous Photoaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) isolate number source , include bone marrow , adipose tissue , peripheral blood . The MSCs manufacture study subset non-hematopoietic stem cell derive bone marrow healthy , adult donor . These cell ability migrate area injury body differentiate multiple cell type , include cutaneous cell . In addition contribute directly repair skin replace damage cell , MSCs also stimulate body 's cell regenerate . Though increase number patient seek remedy photoaged skin , current treatment , range topical medication laser peel , ideal method address medical need . Because MSCs show clinical non-clinical application useful wound healing , also possible cell similar effect skin rejuvenation . In present study , determine efficacy safety intravenously deliver MSCs otherwise healthy patient significant cutaneous photodamage .</detailed_description>
