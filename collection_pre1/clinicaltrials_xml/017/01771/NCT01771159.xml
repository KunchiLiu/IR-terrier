	<brief_summary>Spinal Cord Injured [ SCI ] patient typically `` pee '' . Injury spinal cord disrupt in-coming out-going brain signal coordinate bladder sensation empty bladder . SCI typically cause chronic retention urine uncontrolled leakage urine . Some form tube ( catheter ) need drain urine except mild form SCI . Two type tube drain urine use many year . These type urethral ( inserted bladder opening usually use empty bladder ) abdominal , call suprapubic cystostomy tube ( put bladder abdomen ) . Bacteria ( germ ) normally live skin . Bacteria sticky surface stick catheter surface . Bacteria reproduce rapidly dozen million 24 hour . In warm liquid environment , like urine , bacteria reach density 10 million per cubic centimeter 48 hour cause infection . Oral drug antibiotic-coated catheter delay process week two , within month 100 % patient bacteria urine . Existing drug eliminate microbial sanctuary . The TBC 'closed access ' abdominal drainage tube 'cuff ' 'anchor ' . It permanently place abdominal muscle bond body 's tissue . Another catheter temporarily connect TBC easily replaceable clinic without anesthesia special instrument . It lock form water-tight system . Many part TBC coat antibacterial substance delay growth bacteria . The TBC use success multiple animal study . This Phase I human clinical trial TBC use 10 spinal cord injure patient , follow 12 month longer . Abdominal catheter exit site photograph monthly test periodically document growth bacteria . Every three month , patient complete satisfaction questionnaire urine test bacteria . Urine also test clinically indicate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) result permanent paraplegia quadriplegia approximately 10,000 Americans annually . All patient SCI neuropathic dysfunction urinary bladder . Progressive neurological syndrome multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , Stroke , hemiplegia dementia also induce progressive neuropathic bladder dysfunction . Neurologic impairment bladder cause contribute chronic urinary retention urinary incontinence . Several million Americans suffer chronic neuropathic urinary retention incontinence . Males tend develop urinary retention female tend develop urinary incontinence gender commonly develop element . Current management include [ ] indwell tube ( urethral catheterization [ b ] suprapubic ( abdominal ) catheterization , [ c ] intermittent urethral catheterization [ 4+times per day ] , surgical rehabilitation [ e.g . use autogenous intestinal conduit reservoirs ] . No single form management ideal . A high percentage elder disable patient poor candidate non-candidates surgical rehabilitation co-morbidities limited life expectancy . A majority neurologically impaired patient manage chronic tube drainage bladder [ e.g . a-c , ] . Traditional tube drainage bladder may either via urethra via intubated fistula low abdomen . Intermittent catheterizationâ€”by patient care giver -- via urethra well accept sometimes use method . This technique occasionally use [ attendant ] cognitively impair patient quadriplegic impairment upper extremity . Intermittent catheterization expensive provide professional care giver social domestic burden provide family member . In chronically impaired [ cognitively physically ] patient chronic indwell urethral suprapubic tube evolve practical widely use treatment option . Chronic urinary infection bladder stone recurrent problem patient use indwell tube . Foley urethral catheter [ also commonly use suprapubic tube ] licensed 30 day use FDA . Indwelling urethral catheter suprapubic tube `` open eco-systems ' provide easy access skin flora . Skin microbes migrate along tubes gain access bladder urine become colonized 100 % case . Both gram-stain positive [ gram + ] gram-stain negative [ gram- ] organism easily gain access bladder urine . Both type microbe form biofilms catheter within 48 hour colonization . The biofilms microbial sanctuary highly resistant eradication antibiotic . Use antimicrobial agent [ often non-urinary indication ] may eradicate common urinary pathogen thereby 'select ' resistant organism . Multiple organisms resistant organism commonly grow bladder neurologically impaired patient utilize indwelling urethral suprapubic tube . Both type tube tend induce bladder spasm urinary leakage thereby soil under-garments bed clothes . A majority patient smell urine-chronically . Urine normally supersaturated dissolved salt , notably physiologic concentration calcium , phosphorus , oxalic acid , magnesium . Foreign body [ e.g . indwell tube ' ] initiate nucleation salt precipitate form stone catheter . A high percentage neurologically impaired patient Proteus species chronic bacteriuria . These urea-splitting [ urease produce ] organism greatly accelerate formation struvite [ magnesium-ammonium-phosphate ] stone catheter ; rapid stone formation may necessitate catheter exchange frequently monthly . Significant expense attend chronic use traditional urinary catheter . Monthly travel clinic monthly replacement drainage catheter management febrile reaction may precipitate tube change routine expensive . Surgical procedure commonly require remove bladder , kidney ureteral stone develop consequence chronic bacteriuria . Soiled garment bed prevail order urine cause many disabled patient put assist care facility .</detailed_description>
