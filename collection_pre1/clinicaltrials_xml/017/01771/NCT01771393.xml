	<brief_summary>ConeBeam scanner ( CBCT ) widely technique use dental maxillofacial imaging . Patients set sit lay position , Newtom 5G CBCT allow analysis limb distal joint . Our hypothesis cone-beam scanner could detect characterize chondral lesion cartilage similarly multidetector CT ( MDCT ) . 100 patient 18 year require arthroscanner wrist , ankle , elbow knee enrol The primary endpoint base ability cone-beam scanner detect cartilage lesion . Secondary endpoint concern depiction joint lesion , quality image , tolerability exams inter- intra-operator reproducibility . After arthrography , patient MDCT consider reference exam , CBCT randomize order . Exams anonymized read twice two trained radiologist 3-6 week interval . The inter-observer agreement diagnosis cartilage lesion type two technique evaluate kappa coefficient . The evaluation diagnostic performance achieve studying sensitivity , specificity , negative predictive value positive predictive value , likelihood ratio . Kappa test perform evaluate consistency depiction lesion . A Student test perform pair data distribution normal , Wilcoxon test . To assess patient 's tolerance , percentage ( painful , painful ) calculate technique compare use Chi2 test ( Fisher 's exact test chi apply ) .</brief_summary>
