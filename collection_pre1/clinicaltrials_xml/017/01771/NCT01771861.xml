	<brief_title>Evaluation Trauma Team Activation Criteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Multidisciplinary trauma team reduce mortality become important part modern trauma care . Activation trauma team ( TTA ) receive patient potentially severe injury protocols TTA , widely implement throughout Scandinavia . Trauma team activation guideline vary somewhat among Scandinavian trauma center , resemble recommendation American College Surgery - Committee On Trauma ( ACS-COT ) . The criterion base parameter physiologic compromise , anatomic injury classification , mechanism injury ( MOI ) . They design prevent undue delay vital care trauma team activate prehospital information indicate least one TTA criterion fulfil . A substantial overtriage ( activation trauma team despite minor moderate injury ) common may reach 70 % , mostly reflect limit precision criterion relate MOI . Overtriage mainly resource problem , assembly multidisciplinary trauma team divert personnel important activity hospital . Undertriage delays diagnosis treatment severely injured patient may compromise clinical outcome even increase mortality . ACS-COT suggest overtriage high 50 % acceptable order minimize undertriage . Triage criterion adapt local case-load injury pattern , may vary considerably geographical region . The predictive property triage criterion depend prevalence severe injury . Typical Scandinavian trauma hospital predominance blunt penetrate injury . Furthermore , frequency severe polytrauma admission low . In 2011 , publish evaluation trauma team activation protocol hospital , lead change criterion . This study represent evaluation change also address whether may potential improvement . 2 . Aim study The aim study establish predictive property TTA protocol , individual criterion , possible suggest change reduce over- undertriage . The study also give overview frequency type emergency procedure university hospital trauma center , contribute optimal resource use indicate type surgical skill necessary trauma emergency procedure . 3 . Method Identification patient inclusion-/exclusion criterion The trauma register UNN Tromsø register patient admit TTA . Also include patient penetrate injury head/neck/torso/extremities proximal elbow knee , patient New Injury Severity Score ( NISS ) &gt; 12 patient head injury AIS≥3 . Excluded trauma register patient chronic subdural hematoma , patient injury drown , inhalation asphyxia ( strangulation/hanging ) . From patient trauma register time period 1.2.2013 - 31.01.2015 , identify include patient . Data collection Almost necessary data available trauma register . Criteria use activation trauma team , register trauma registry , hence , register documentation emergency medical dispatch centre ( AMK ) Tromsø . Classification injuries All injury classify accord Abbreviated Injury Scale ( AIS ) ) extent injury classify Injury Severity Scale ( ISS ) . Both classification perform authorized registrar . Triage The TTA protocol evaluate two standard , ISS emergency procedure . Triage consider correct ISS &gt; 15 emergency procedure perform aim stabilize respiration circulation . Overtriage define fraction TTA patient severely injured ( ISS≤15 ) receive emergency procedure . Undertriage define fraction severely injured ( ISS &gt; 15 ) emergency procedure perform , patient admit without TTA . The ability criterion predict severe trauma and/or need emergency procedure , give percentage patient fulfil specific criterion also ISS &gt; 15 and/or subject emergency procedure . Hypothesis Previously , undertriage 12 % overtriage UNN Tromsø 70 % . On 01.04.2011 , trauma team activation protocol UNN Tromsø revise , previously 27 criterion , five criterion remove . We plan assess current protocol lead improvement under- overtriage . We also want identify criterion seldom use ( &lt; 5 % patient ) and/or low positive predictive value ( &lt; 10 % ) , criterion consider omit . A last hypothesis analyze `` walking wound '' safe admit without mobilize trauma team ( `` walking wound '' patient injure patient loss conscience walk ) , give enough prehospital information ass . 4 . Design The study prospective cohort study , base data trauma register UNN Tromsø . 5 . Parameters Baseline characteristic include patient : - sex - age - mechanism injury - classification injury AIS ISS - transfer hospital Outcome parameter include - type frequency emergency procedure perform local hospital UNN Tromsø - Criteria use trauma team activation . - mortality Emergency procedures include : - Chest tube insertion - Hemostatic surgery abdomen - Hemostatic surgery pelvis pack - Thoracotomy - Primary stabilization fracture ( external fixation ) - Endotracheal intubation ( addition ) 6 . Statistical method Simple statistical method like frequency , mean , median percentage use . 7 . Study group Supervisor dr.med . Kristian Bartnes , Avd . hjerte-/lunge-/karkirurgi , UNN . Coworkers dr.med . Knut Fredriksen , Akuttmedisinsk avd . UNN ; cand.med . Svein Arne Monsen , Anestesiavd . UNN cand.med . Trond Dehli , Gastrokirurgisk avd , UNN . Trond Dehli responsible practical follow-up study . 8 . Time Schedule Data collection start 1.2.13 continue 31.01.15 . Since registration data trauma registry likely delay 2-12 week , registration data continue patient registry complete . Presentation study form abstract/posters manuscript write 2015 . 9 . Ethics publication The protocol send regional ethical committee approval . We plan present result national international conference , also peer-reviewed medical journal .</detailed_description>
