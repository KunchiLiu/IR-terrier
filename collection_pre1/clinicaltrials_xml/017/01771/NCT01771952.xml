So far , drug/device give 10,000 people knee pain ( due osteoarthritis ) proven safe effective patient moderate severe pain due knee joint osteoarthritis . If agree participate either receive Synvisc-One® injection placebo injection contain active study drug . You able take medication pain Acetominophen ( like Tylenol ) duration study . You ask study , knee pain . All test procedure study do solely research purpose . Up 100 people study UVA . How long study take ? Your participation study require 4 study visit 6 month . Each visit last 1 hour . What happen study ? SCREENING ( take approximately 60 minute complete ) : Visit 1-2 ( Week 1 ) If agree participate , sign consent form study related procedure take place . Before start study , screen period . You test procedure time make sure eligible safe participate . These include following : - Review medical history - Physical exam knee - An x-ray knee - Completion 5 brief questionnaire - Thigh muscle strength test : contract thigh muscle hard electrical stimulus deliver directly muscle front thigh . This stimulus cause thigh muscle twitch quickly . This stimulus may cause minor discomfort . If cause intolerable amount discomfort , continue portion data collection . The stimulus experiment feel similar static electricity shock sometimes felt touch doorknob something else metal . The intensity static electricity shock usually range 2000-4000 volt . The maximum voltage deliver experiment 125 volt . You enrol evidence muscle weakness . If test show eligible , proceed immediately study procedure return clinic ( within 7 day ) begin study treatment . STUDY PROCEDURES/ RANDOMIZATION ( visit last 60 minute ) : You randomly assign ( like flip coin ) 1 2 study treatment group . You equal chance assign one group . Neither doctor choose treatment assign . Neither doctor know study treatment get study do . But doctor need know , people study find . GROUP 1 : Synvisc-One® injection : You receive single injection knee . We may numb skin cold spray prior injection front knee joint . GROUP 2 : Sham Injection : This similar placebo injection . A placebo define harmless substance look like study device , effect . We may numb skin cold spray prior injection front knee joint . In case , needle place joint injection , nothing inject . You able find treatment get study do . If doctor need know , people study find . If randomize group , eligible injection Synvisc-One® last study visit ( 6 month ) need depend amount pain experience . You sign separate consent form portion study . You prescribe standardize home-based leg strengthen program include simple low-intensity exercise thigh muscle . We review exercise understand correctly . We also tell long often exercise provided exercise diary provide exercise description reminder . You ask return exercise book visit During study , ask fill questionnaire . These questionnaire ask : - feel - lifestyle habit function - daily activity - medicine use These questionnaire take 15 minute complete . FOLLOW UP : Visit 3-5 ; Weeks 4 , 12 26 ) You return follow test evaluation 1 month , 3 month 6 month follow injection . During follow visit collect follow : - Knee joint examination - Completion 5 brief questionnaire - Thigh muscle strength test - Questions medication usage problem may knee . - Return exercise book What risk study ? Risks side effect relate device ( Synvisc-one® ) include : Less Likely ( 2 every 100 subject may experience ) - Arthralgia ( pain knee joint ) - Arthritis ( degeneration knee joint cartilage ) - Arthropathy ( injury knee joint ) - Pain site injection - Swelling inside knee joint Risks side effect related procedure ( thigh muscle test knee joint evaluation ) study include : Less Likely - Thigh Muscle discomfort - Thigh muscle soreness - Knee Pain Risks radiation knee : This study involve radiation exposure X-ray knee . As part everyday living , everyone expose small amount background radiation come soil , rock , outer space within body . The radiation dose receive study amount receive 101 day background radiation . The risk dose small . This radiation exposure necessary medical care necessary obtain research information desire Risks woman : If pregnant , get pregnant course study participation , please tell u . Being study might hurt unborn baby , able join stay study . Use effective method birth control time . If question birth control , please ask study doctor primary care physician.. Other unexpected risk : You may side effect expect know watch . You may also experience possible unknown chronic effect future may occur many year injection . Call study leader symptom problem . Will pay study ? You pay $ 100 finishing study check sent mail . You get payment 4 week finish study . The income may report IRS income . You pay decide finish study . If study leader say continue enrol , pay full amount study . If owe money Virginia state agency , state use money earn study pay debt . These state agency include UVa Medical Center , VCU Medical Center college university . The money may withhold pay back debt thing unpaid medical bill , tax , fine , child support . Even happen , money earn may report IRS taxable income . Will study cost money ? Participation study cost money . The study cover cost physician visit , knee x-ray injection . You insurance company must pay test care give beyond require study . In addition , health plan may also pay drug treatment give help control side effect .
