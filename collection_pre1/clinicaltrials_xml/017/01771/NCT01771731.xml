	<brief_summary>Our primary objective ass whether inhale vaporized cannabis ameliorate chronic pain patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . As patient chronic opioid analgesic , investigator also assess possible synergistic affect inhale cannabis opioids . The investigator also assess clinical safety concomitant use cannabinoids opioids patient SCD monitor short-term side effect associate combined therapy . Finally , investigator evaluate short-term effect inhale cannabis marker inflammation disease progression patient SCD . Hypotheses follow : 1 . Inhaled cannabis significantly reduce chronic pain patient SCD . 2 . Inhaled cannabis significantly alter short-term side effect experience patient take opioids SCD . 3 . Inhaled cannabis significantly alter marker inflammation disease progression patient SCD compare placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaporized Cannabis Chronic Pain Associated With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof-of-principle investigation safety potential effectiveness inhale vaporized cannabis add stable analgesic regimen sickle cell disease ( SCD ) patient chronic pain . The study comprise two 5-day intervention period inpatient setting ( Clinical Research Center SFGH ) , completion 5-day daily pain diary prior admission establish outpatient baseline . Participants randomly assign , double-blind fashion , treatment ( A ) vaporize cannabis approximately 1:1 ration delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol : cannabidiol ( B ) vaporize placebo . Those receive treatment A first admission receive treatment B second , receive treatment B first admission receive treatment A second . The two admission space least 14 day apart . On Day 1 admission , subject provide blood sample baseline marker inflammation SCD disease progression . They undergo assessment pain , mood , quality life . At 12 pm Day 1 , inhale vaporize study agent ( equivalent 1 cannabis/placebo cigarette ) use VolcanoÂ® vaporizer ; Days 2-4 inhale study agent 8 , 2 pm , 8 pm , inhale final dose Day 5 8 . Subjects continue pre-study analgesic regimen study . If additional analgesia require , supplemental therapy administer dose record . Pain measurement visual analogue scale obtain every 2 hour subject awake . On Day 5 second set blood sample inflammation marker disease progression obtain , subject complete pain , mood , quality life assessment .</detailed_description>
