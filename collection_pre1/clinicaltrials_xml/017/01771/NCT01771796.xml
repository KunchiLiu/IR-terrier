	<brief_title>Training Effects Following Resection Surgery Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical treatment lung cancer ( LC ) lead peripheral respiratory muscle dysfunction ( Mdys ) exercise limitation . This characteristic feature might generate , reduce lung function , also deconditioning well respiratory peripheral muscle dysfunction . It remain unknown potential benefit result specific training effect plasmatic mediator . Chronic diseases lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide know regular exercise beneficial effect . Many study show benefit exercise patient diagnose cancer , especially breast colorectal cancer , even active phase specific treatment , however study refers possible benefit exercise patient lung cancer follow surgical resection . Lung cancer one common cancer Spain , second general population first refer exclusively male population . Not common type cancer , also present high mortality survival rate 5 year approximately 12 % . However , survival improve significantly stage I ( 60-80 % 5 year ) progressively bad stage IV ( &lt; 5 % 5 year ) . Surgery treatment choice lung cancer stag I IIa . Despite good result term survival , free side effect . Depending extent lung resection , may result functional limitation impact patient ' quality life . Pulmonary lobectomy entail significant reduction functional reserve : impaired lung function ( FEV1 15 % ) reduce exercise capacity ( 16 % shuttle test ) . In contrast , pneumonectomy , reduce pulmonary function disproportionately high ( FEV1 35 % ) comparison exercise limitation ( 23 % ) . To date knowledge study specifically evaluate effect exercise training patient . Dysfunction diaphragm respiratory muscle , prevalent COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) patient , important clinical implication . It associate susceptibility hypercapnic ventilatory failure , ineffective cough , even high incidence repeat hospital admission mortality . Therefore , respiratory muscle weakness describe patient justifies need train respiratory muscle general exercise ( bicycle , leg , arm ) able induce overload enough achieve training effect respiratory muscle . Since large proportion lung cancer patient also suffer COPD , endurance strength respiratory muscle expect reduced . Moreover , lobectomy patient degree peripheral muscle deconditioning , could link loss reserve function , also relative rest . Although muscle training successfully use restore function patient various chronic disease frailty , little evidence beneficial effect muscle train patient lung cancer surgery . Many study relate insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) major regulatory protein , Insulin-like growth factor bind protein ( IGFBP-3 ) various malignancy , include lung cancer . In healthy subject sedentary lifestyle , caloric diet lead obesity alteration hormonal , metabolic inflammatory modulate carcinogenesis . These disorder include chronic hyperinsulinemia , elevate plasma IGF-I , plasma enhance bioavailability increase steroid sex hormone systemic inflammation marker . Physical exercise , addition cardiovascular effect and/or muscular strength endurance produce response plasmatic level IGF-I IGFBP-3 . This variability justify , case , depend type , intensity and/or duration exercise perform .</detailed_description>
