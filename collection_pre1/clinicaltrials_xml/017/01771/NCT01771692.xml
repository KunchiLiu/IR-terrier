	<brief_summary>Fixed brace ( appliance ) use straighten malalignment teeth . There lot research factor affect speed alignment teeth little research different technique wire attachment brace ( ligation ) affect . The randomised clinical trial 100 patient aim compare speed alignment low ( mandibular ) front teeth ( incisor ) use two different technique period 12 week . Both technique use conventional small elastic ring ( module ) place metal square ( bracket ) tie different configuration group . We also observe difference distance correspond teeth either side low jaw group bracket failure rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Clinical Trial : Conventional Ligation v Figure 8</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research protocol devise Rachel Little ( Specialty Registrar Orthodontics ) , supervision Mr David Spary ( Consultant Orthodontics ) Dr Ashish Dhopatkar ( Head Orthodontics , Birmingham Dental School ) . Purpose : In study I intend find whether friction play part lower incisor alignment compare different ligation technique . If I show speed alignment affect different technique , important find orthodontic treatment . Aims : This study aim determine whether increase friction cause ligation figure eight module effect speed low incisor alignment . Recruitment consent : 100 orthodontic patient ( n=50 per group ) attend new patient clinic Burton Hospital require correction malalignment teeth fixed appliance select . Potential participant invite take part study give verbal write information . If agree participate , write consent obtain . All patient competent capable make decision . All patient study 16 year age , parental/legal guardian consent obtain . The patient able withdraw study time , wish continue participate . Method : Participants randomly allocate either conventional module group ( figure O ) figure 8 module group , follow consent participation trial . Randomisation use method block randomisation . Allocation undertaken non-clinician . The plan use study model ( replica patient 's teeth make plaster ) pre treatment record baseline data take additional mould ( impression ) low teeth participant normal orthodontic appointment six twelve week appliances put . All measurement require take study model use digital calliper , impression cast laboratory . Benefits treatment : â€¢ Improved appearance function teeth Risks treatment : - Tooth decay gum disease ( prevent good oral hygiene low sugar intake ) - Discomfort - Breakages - Relapse ( retainer wear fix appliance remove ) - Root shorten Confidentiality : The study model analyse stored patient 's model box along note lock office . At point research personal detail disclose person directly involve provide orthodontic care . Conflict interest : No conflict interest know expect arise study . At end study : A summary sheet finding study make available participant request .</detailed_description>
