	<brief_summary>In closed-loop control anesthesia , feedback measure clinical effect use continuously adjust drug infusion rate . Anesthetic drug deliver variable rate personalize individual patient . The aim provide great hemodynamic respiratory stability , stable depth anesthesia , ability predict recovery administer low total dose drug . Previous work closed-loop control intravenous anesthesia focus titration propofol response depth hypnosis ( DOH ) measure derive electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . The purpose pilot study evaluate iControl-RP , system , performs control delivery remifentanil propofol infusion . iControl-RP allow either drug operate 3 mode : closed-loop control base feedback EEG measure supply NeuroSENSE ( 1 ) ; target-controlled infusion ( TCI ) , base previously-described pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) model ; conventional manual infusion , require weight-based dose setting . A pilot two-phase study undertaken group adult patient direct immediate supervision experience anesthesiologist . In Phase 1 ( involve 50 study subject ) , propofol administer closed-loop mode remifentanil infusion administer base TCI . The data collect phase use tune controller parameter , initially base previously publish PKPD data . The controller performance evaluate phase 2 ( involve 100 study subject ) , propofol remifentanil administer closed loop mode . In phase , case select receive propofol remifentanil anesthetic agent routine surgical procedure . The investigator aim demonstrate closed-loop control anesthesia analgesia base EEG feedback clinically feasible . This pilot study help u take significant step towards control trial clinical benefit method closed-loop control anesthesia assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed-loop Control Anesthesia : Controlled Delivery Remifentanil Propofol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose pilot study demonstrate control delivery remifentanil propofol clinically feasible collect sample clinical data optimise control function . That , demonstrate iControl remifentanil-propofol control system ( iControl-RP ) use provide safe effective administration anesthesia ( maintain requirement intervention anaesthesiologist necessary ) collect sample clinical data allow ECEM engineer optimise parameter iControl-RP control system Justification : Closed-loop control provide opportunity deliver anesthetic drug variable rate personalize individual patient . This suggest may provide great hemodynamic respiratory stability , stable depth anesthesia , ability predict recovery administer low total dose drug . Much development work still require mesh closed-loop control technology anesthetic practice . The result initial study fee subsequent large study wherein clinical , operational economic benefit closed-loop control anesthesia submit controlled trial . Objectives : The primary objective pilot study demonstrate feasibility closed-loop control delivery propofol remifentanil use DOH feedback NeuroSENSE show safe effective mechanism administration anesthesia analgesia adult patient undergoing routine elective surgical procedure . The secondary objective pilot study collect sample clinical data optimise tune parameter system . Research Method : A pilot two-phase study undertaken group adult patient direct immediate supervision experience anesthesiologist : Phase 1 : tuning controller parameter Propofol infusion closed-loop control ; remifentanil run target-controlled infusion ( TCI ) ; system comparable system evaluate adult patient HÃ´pital Foch , Franc . The goal phase collect data validate mid-ranging controller design , base population-based PKPD model . Phase 2 : evaluating controller performance The mid-ranging control system evaluate ; propofol remifentanil infusion rate closed-loop control . In phase , case select among patient would receive propofol remifentanil anesthetic agent planned procedure . Research procedures similar two study phase . The anesthesiologist closely monitor patient per routine practice ability , time , modify anesthetic/analgesic drug administer . That , he/she able adjust target DOH effect ; adjust target effect site concentration remifentanil ; immediately switch manual control either infusion ; administer bolus dose immediately stop infusion either drug . Investigational device iControl-RP develop study ECEM group UBC head Prof. Dumont . iControl-RP control system develop automatic closed-loop drug delivery anesthesia . In study remifentanil use fast actuator ( control analgesia ) propofol use slow actuator ( control hypnosis ) . Remifentanil use counteract disturbance measure DOH related insufficient analgesia propofol use maintain stable baseline DOH . iControl-RP connected NeuroSENSE , 2 infusion pump separately-controlled propofol remifentanil administration , operate room ( OR ) patient monitor . It user interface , display WAVCNS , infusion rate effect site concentration propofol remifentanil . The user interface allows anesthesiologist set target WAVCNS , switch mode operation ( manual , TCI , closed-loop ) set manual infusion rate target effect-site concentration either drug , require . The system extensively test laboratory usability , reliability repeatability . The vital sign collect OR patient monitor provide information safety alert . Health Canada Investigational approval seek receive commencement study . How system work iControl-RP control infusion rate propofol infusion pump ( Alaris TIVA ) remifentanil infusion pump ( Graseby 3400 ) . The system allow either drug infusion operate 3 mode : closed-loop control , relies WAVCNS feedback NeuroSENSE ; TCI , base PKPD model ; manual , require weight-based dose setting ( .e.g mcg/kg/min ) .</detailed_description>
