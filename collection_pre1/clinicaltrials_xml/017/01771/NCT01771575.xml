	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major worldwide health issue . Figures Centers Disease control show 1.7 million people suffer TBI annually . Meanwhile World Health Organization recognize TBI one significant health issue develop country . In military , mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) one frequent sequela modern war . Dizziness balance disorder frequent sequela mTBI account significant degree mTBI morbidity . At current time , best treatment modality dizziness secondary mTBI vestibular rehabilitation ( VR ) . While VR effective , therapy time consuming , universally successful , result incomplete recovery many patient . Work need do attempt improve therapy outcomes . This project study use neuromodulation ( stimulation tongue ) adjuvant improve effectiveness VR reduce time involve VR . Given past work variant minimal medical impact appliance , use PoNS™ device augment therapy may result significant improvement VR outcomes . Given enormous public health military burden mTBI , give dizziness major component often responsible significant morbidity , project significant military civilian impact beneficial suffer mTBI worldwide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use PoNS™ Device Treatment Blunt Blast Induced Vestibular Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CN-NINM intervention experimental regimen . It develop last 12 year Tactile Communication Neurorehabilitation Laboratory ( TCNL ) University Wisconsin - Madison . All human subject test perform IRB approval . The PoNS™ experimental device evolve period TCNL , FDA approve . An Investigator 's Brochure attendant Safety Chart develop satisfy requirement Investigational Device Exemption , provide additional context respect research propose . The goal work test effectiveness device standard rehabilitation therapy individual operationally induce balance disorder blunt blast head trauma . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES : 1 . To compare effectiveness active PoNS-2 ( PoNS™ ) device combine standard vestibular rehabilitation placebo PoNS™ device vestibular rehabilitation patient blast blunt head trauma induce dizziness time period standard course therapy . 2 . To compare effectiveness active PoNS™ device combine standard vestibular rehabilitation placebo PoNS™ device vestibular rehabilitation patient blast blunt head trauma induce dizziness three month standard course rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
