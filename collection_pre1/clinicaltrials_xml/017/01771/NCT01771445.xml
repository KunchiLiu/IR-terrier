	<brief_summary>Aim : Evaluate regulation muscle derive Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) exercise particular whether regulate Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) system . Rationale : It show IL-1 antagonism improve glycemia insulin secretion patient type 2 Diabetes . However , IL-1 antagonism also decrease IL-6 level . The effect IL-6 glucose metabolism unclear past subject intense debate , recent evidence indicate beneficial role regulate glucose metabolism . However little known regulation muscle-induced IL-6 produce exercise . It therefore aim investigate whether exercise induce increase IL-6 dependent IL-1 system . If IL-1 antagonism decrease IL-6 along , beneficial potential IL-6 , may require additional medication like IL-6 substitution dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ( DPP-IV ) antagonists . In addition , investigator assess effect IL-1 antagonism insulin Glucagon like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion well muscle soreness , fatigue vascular function response acute exercise bout .</brief_summary>
