	<brief_summary>Many miss delayed cancer diagnose result breakdown communication coordination abnormal finding suspicious cancer , often first emerge primary care set . Delays follow-up abnormal test result persist despite reliable delivery test result electronic health record . This intervention final study three-phase project develop test innovative automate surveillance intervention improve timely diagnosis follow-up five common cancer primary care practice . The investigator hypothesize median time day diagnostic clue follow-up action ( e.g . time colonoscopy examination abnormal colon-related test ) significantly less intervention arm usual care . The investigator also hypothesize proportion patient receive appropriate timely follow-up care significantly high intervention arm usual care .</brief_summary>
