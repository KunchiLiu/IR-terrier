	<brief_title>Cervicovaginal Immune Responses 3 Deltoid Thigh Intramuscular ( IM ) TicoVac</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study investigate whether target vaccine antigen lymph node ( internal iliac ) drain low limb cervix/vagina alters subsequent antibody response detect cervix/vagina , compare target vaccine antigen unrelated lymph node axilla drain right deltoid muscle upper arm . The right arm specifically select lymphatics right upper part body drain directly blood stream via right lymphatic duct share lymphatic connection rest body . In contrast lymph rest body ultimately drain thoracic duct ( see figure ) . By immunise right arm investigator sure vaccine antigens antigen present cell activate lymphocyte pass lymph node common cervix vagina . In contrast injecting anterolateral thigh ( right side select uniformity ) investigator sure vaccine antigens pass external inguinal lymph node also receive antigen lymphocytes respond vaginal cervical infection inflammation . The choice right leg standardise . It investigators hypothesis therefore result antigen presentation stimulation within specifically `` genital tract milieu '' T &amp; B lymphocytes leave external iliac node result immunisation thigh pattern way likely home back cervix vagina due common drainage cervix , vagina thigh ( Figure 1 ) external iliac lateral aortic lymph node . In contrast , cell leave axillary lymph node immunisation right arm enter blood directly via right lymphatic duct pas lymph node common cervix vagina . The investigator detect effect target immunisation number way : 1 . By detect increased level vaccine-specific antibody cervico-vaginal secretion result activate B cell ( plasmablast ) home back genital tract . IgG antibody may transudated blood local mucosal IgG may also produce . In contrast , mucosal IgA likely locally produce may therefore preferentially affect targeted immunisation . However individual level mucosal antibody vary widely subject , especially IgA , investigator set primary endpoint basis fold-increase antibody level baseline , rather concentration . As mucosal IgG responses generally reliable great magnitude investigator set primary objective vaccine-specific mucosal IgG three immunisation . Vaccine-specific mucosal IgA responses three immunisation secondary objective . The study power basis investigator limit experience similar vaccine detect double proportion responder IgG IgA . The investigator base fold-increase vaccine-specific mucosal IgG IgA investigator limit experience similar vaccine inject arm ( 7 ) . In addition , investigator measure change variable exploratory nature assay quantification less well establish : 2 . By detect `` mucosal '' pattern B cell response blood increase number vaccine-specific B cell genital targeted immunisation . 3 . By detect difference cell surface phenotypic marker vaccine-specific lymphocyte indicate mucosal origin . There two treatment group : - Group 1 receive vaccine right deltoid muscle ( upper arm ) drain unrelated lymph node axilla . - Group 2 receive vaccine upper anterolateral right thigh , antigen expect drain inguinal lymph node also drain cervix/vagina . To ensure complete disconnection drain lymph node always RIGHT arm RIGHT leg immunise . It hypothesise target internal iliac node lead enhance mucosal antibody response cervix/vagina , detect increase vaccine-specific IgA cervico-vaginal secretion collect Softcup . In addition , lymphocytes ( B T cell ) external iliac lymph node may carry surface marker associate mucosal home secrete different combination cytokine ( Th17 ) emanate axillary node express systemic phenotype . This detect flow cytometry , ELISPOT bead separation use phenotypic marker , immunological assay . Immune response readouts IgG IgA antibodies TBEV antigen vaccine , compare two group time point peak response expect ( 28 day third immunisation ) . As investigator wish investigate ability vaccine specifically prime subject target way , participant must naive vaccine antigen must vaccine TBEV infection . Therefore investigator use TicoVac - TBEV vaccine licence UK UK adult generally receive , TBEV infection endemic UK . TicoVac widely use central eastern Europe TBEV endemic extremely uncommon , offer traveller UK endemic area likely engage high risk activity ( hiking , trek ) . Mucosal responses TBEV relevant TBEV transmit tick bite . Immune responses TicoVac act model vaccine mucosal antibody response vagina relevance block infection ( e.g . HIV , HPV , HSV ) target immunisation may increase efficacy . Although strictly speak induction anti-TBEV antibody cervico-vaginal secretion relevance efficacy TicoVac vaccine blood-injected virus , investigator designate parameter efficacy model target immunisation . The purpose human immune physiology study use TBEV vaccine model neoantigen investigate immune readout antigen target . The collection adverse event safety data therefore relevant study objective systematic collection safety data , require Risk Assessed `` Type A '' CTIMP ( SUSAR reporting MHRA/REC/Concerned Investigators , Annual List Suspected Serious Adverse Reactions part Annual Safety Report/Development Safety Update Report ) .</detailed_description>
