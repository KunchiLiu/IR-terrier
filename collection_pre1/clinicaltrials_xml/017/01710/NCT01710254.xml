	<brief_title>Regadenoson Stress-MRI Identify Coronary Artery Disease Atrial Fibrillation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific Background/Rationale : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) large grow healthcare problem worldwide . Over 7 million people U.S. Europe currently suffer atrial fibrillation , number expect double 2050 . The lifetime risk AF high : ~24 % age 40 , risk remain fairly constant old age , 22 % lifetime risk age 80 [ 1 ] . AF significantly increase risk stroke mortality , greatly limit quality life . Little research do AF ischemic cardiomyopathy , though relatively common co-morbidity . CT find increase prevalence ( 41 % vs 27 % ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient AF compare patient similar pre-test risk AF [ 2 ] . AF patient positive SPECT scan CAD bad prognosis cardiac event patient positive SPECT without AF [ 3 ] . It recently report study 253 AF patient , AF patient positive SPECT study high number false positives - 15 % patient significant CAD angiography ( compare 67 % control group ) [ 4 , 5 ] . Just half patient sinus rhythm SPECT , since similar number positive see half , author feel image AF cause poor specificity . Use MRI assessment CAD grow area entail radiation exposure patient . Advances MRI make possible accurately detect CAD , either well well SPECT unselected population [ 6 , 7 ] . However , adoption MRI myocardial perfusion scan limited part due challenge associate use adenosine . Adenosine require start second IV , use either special expensive MRI-compatible infusion pump deliver drug , long lengths tube run pump outside scanner room . Neither solution ideal , regadenoson would require pump start second IV . Here investigator propose determine sensitivity/specificity dynamic contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion MRI vasodilator regadenoson subpopulation patient - atrial fibrillation . The investigator great deal experience stress rest myocardial perfusion MRI . In preliminary study image three patient AF go X-ray angiography ( cath ) , two three subject significant stenosis cath , one . This agree regadenoson stress perfusion MRI finding . These MRI acquisition perform Siemens Verio MRI scanner . The Verio operate twice magnetic field strength ( 3 Tesla , 3T ) MRI scanner , operate 1.5T . The high magnetic field offer image significantly less noise ( almost twice signal-to-noise ratio ) . Objective : To demonstrate sensitivity/specificity comparable report meta-analyses non-AF patient adenosine ( 90 % /80 % [ 6 , 7 ] ) , atrial fibrillation population use time-efficient vasodilator regadenoson require single IV . Study Design : This prospective , open-label , comparative trial use MRI . Non-invasive MRI measurement rest flow flow regadenoson stress obtain subject one hour MRI exam use advanced MRI acquisition technique . 32 subject recruit study . Study Procedure : Each subject undergo single MRI scanning session . Caffeine stop 12 hour prior procedure . One IV start subject position scanner . Resting perfusion Multihance Gd-BOPTA contrast agent perform first . The perfusion acquisition acquire 3-6 short axis slice heartbeat last one minute . Then standard regadenoson injection 400ug/5cc give MR image perform Gd-BOPTA contrast agent bolus 60-100 second later [ 9 ] [ 10 ] .</detailed_description>

Critically ill patient , patient ventilator patient hypotension , asthmatic , patient whose medical care safety may compromise undergo MRI examination exclude . 2 . Patients claustrophobia also exclude since MRI conduct closed environment . 3 . Patients contraindication MRI ( pacemaker , metal implant ) . 4 . Pregnant subject ( woman may become pregnant ) , minor , prisoner exclude study . 5 . Subjects 60 suspicion abnormal kidney function ( blood test determine Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) perform prior imaging . Subjects GFR &lt; 30 exclude study .
