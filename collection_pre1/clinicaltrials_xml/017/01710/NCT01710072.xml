	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : aspirin attenuate inflammation cerebral aneurysm hence reduces incidence rupture . This effect monitor use signal generate macrophage ( inflammatory biomarker ) ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI . Study aim : 1 . Determine daily aspirin intake ( three month ) would obliterate/reduce ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI signal change generate macrophage cerebral aneurysm wall . Fifteen patient cerebral aneurysm &gt; 7 mm select enroll pilot study . 10 patient imaged base line ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI . Following , take aspirin 81 mg daily re-imaged three month . This group compare control group 5 patient imagings study perform base line three month NOT take aspirin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If eligible enroll study , contact principal investigator person describe study private setting ( neurosurgery clinic room hospital patient room ) . You give ample opportunity decide participate . You randomly assign receive one 2 study treatment , either take aspirin . This mean whichever study treatment receive determine purely chance , like flip coin . You 2 3 chance receiving study treatment ( aspirin ) . You tell study treatment arm . A 15 minute base line MRI brain perform initially . Following , medication ( ferumoxytol ) inject intravenously 3 minute . The second MRI brian obtain 24 hour later . A third MRI obtain also 72 hour follow injection medication . Then third MRI , ten people choose randomly start aspirin every day three month total . The selected aspirin group give 3-month supply aspirin ( 81 mg ) . The five patient ask avoid anti-inflammatory drug ( like aspirin , Advil , ibuprofen , … ) possible . Following interval three month , repeat MRI brain do exactly ( base line MRI brain do , medication inject intravenously ( IV ) . A second MRI obtain 24 hour later follow another one 72 hour later . MRI scan : An MRI scanner take picture inside brain . You ask lie back special table slide tube . The side tube fairly close body scanner make loud hammer noise inside . You able talk people room speaker system . We monitor closely inside scanner . The MRI image study use evaluate health . The image obtain study specific research purpose use find medical abnormality . These image review radiology physician diagnose exist abnormality . Sequence event : 1 . Informed consent obtain . 2 . Serum pregnancy test ( female child bear age ) blood chemistry lab collect . If result positive , able continue study . 3 . IV access insert . 4 . 15-30 minute base-line MRI perform 5 . The study medication , ferumoxytol , give via IV line immediately first MRI 6 . The second MRI obtain 24 hour later 7 . The third MRI obtain 72 hour follow infusion ferumoxytol . 8 . You select randomly either receive aspirin . 9 . Ten patient assigned start take aspirin ( 325mg ) every day 3 month . 10 . Five patient ask avoid anti-inflammatory drug ( like aspirin , Advil , ibuprofen… ) three month possible . 11 . At three month , another base-line MRI perform 12 . The study medication , ferumoxytol , give via IV line immediately first MRI 13 . The second MRI obtain 24 hour later 14 . The third MRI obtain 72 hour follow infusion ferumoxytol 15 . Study finish WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY ? What risk study ? You may experience one risk indicate study . In addition , may unknown risk , risk anticipate , associate study . Aspirin : 1 . Nausea 2 . Vomiting 3 . Stomachache/burn 3 Stomach pain suggestive stomach ulcer 5 . Black stool suggestive rectal bleed 6 . Dizziness 7 . Rash 8 . Fever Ferumoxytol : 1 . Diarrhea ( 4 % ) , 2. nausea ( 3.1 % ) , 3. dizziness ( 2.6 % ) , 4. hypotension ( 2.5 % ) , 5. constipation ( 2.1 % ) , 6. swell leg , arm and/or face ( 2 % ) , 7. headache ( 1.8 % ) , 8. edema ( 1.5 % ) , 9. vomiting ( 1.5 % ) , 10. abdominal pain ( 1.3 % ) , 11. chest pain ( 1.3 % ) , 12. cough ( 1.3 % ) , 13. rash ( 1 % ) , 14. muscle spasm ( 1 % ) , 15. back pain ( 1 % ) , 16. hypertension ( 1 % ) , 17. shortness breath ( 1 % ) , 18. itching ( 1 % ) . 19. life-threatening severe allergic reaction could lead death MRI Scan : You may uncomfortable inside MRI scanner like closed space ( `` claustrophobia '' ) . During procedure , able talk MRI staff speaker system . You tell stop scan time . The MRI produce loud hammer noise , produce hearing loss small number patient . You give earplug reduce risk . Loss confidentiality : 1. name , diagnosis , age , gender potential treatment could access non-research team individual . Intravenous Catheter Insertion : For study need small amount blood drawn laboratory study make sure safe participate study . You intravenous catheter ( IV ) place peripherally ( usually arm hand ) infusion study drug , ferumoxytol . There minimal risk associate placement IV , include pain , bleeding , bruising , infection IV site . Women Capable Becoming Pregnant If woman capable become pregnant , ask pregnancy test beginning study . You must use effective birth control method try become pregnant participate study . If become pregnant , may unknown risk fetus , risk fetus anticipate , associate study . There may long-term effect treatment study could increase risk harm unborn child . If believe know become pregnant participate research study , please contact David Hasan 319-384-8669 soon possible . WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY ? You benefit study . However , hope , future , people might benefit study may inform u take aspirin daily would help stabilize aneurysm wall reduce risk rupture . WHAT OTHER TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE THERE ? Before decide whether study , doctor discus option available . Instead study , could undergo microsurgical clipping aneurysm , aneurysm treat endovascularly place coil aneurysm sac , observe aneurysm monitor imaging study . WILL IT COST ME ANYTHING TO BE IN THIS STUDY ? You additional cost research study . All cost associate MRIs injection cover study . There may additional cost associate travel visit . You and/or medical/hospital insurance carrier remain responsible regular medical care expense . WILL I BE PAID FOR PARTICIPATING ? You give direct compensation research study . However , study pay hotel accommodation may give need lodge MRI visit . WHO IS FUNDING THIS STUDY ? The University research team receive payment agency , organization , company conduct research study . WHAT IF I AM INJURED AS A RESULT OF THIS STUDY ? - If injure become ill take part study , medical treatment available University Iowa Hospitals Clinics . - The University Iowa plan provide free medical care payment treatment illness injury result study unless direct result prove negligence University employee . - If experience research-related illness injury , and/or medical hospital insurance carrier responsible cost treatment . WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY ? We keep participation research study confidential extent permit law . However , possible people indicate may become aware participation study may inspect copy record pertain research . Some record could contain information personally identify . - federal government regulatory agency , - U.S. Food Drug Administration - audit department University Iowa , - University Iowa Institutional Review Board ( committee review approves research study ) To help protect confidentiality , identify name , social security number , address phone number . The hard copy electronic record include code number initial . The list match name code number keep password protect computer file Dr. Hasan 's locked office . Also hard copy study material kept lock file cabinet lock office . If write report article study share study data set others , way directly identify . The University Iowa Hospitals Clinics generally require document medical record chart participate study . The information include chart provide contact information research team well information risk associate study . We keep Informed Consent Document research file ; place medical record chart . IS BEING IN THIS STUDY VOLUNTARY ? Taking part research study completely voluntary . You may choose take part . If decide study , may stop participate time . If decide study , stop participate time , wo n't penalize lose benefit otherwise qualify . What I Decide Drop Out Study ? If decide drop study , suffer adverse consequence ( physical , social , economic , legal psychological ) . Will I Receive New Information About Study Participating ? If obtain new information study might affect willingness continue participate study , 'll promptly provide information . Can Someone Else End Participation Study ? Under certain circumstance , researcher might decide end participation research study earlier plan . This might happen aneurysm rupture become symptomatic . WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ? We encourage ask question . If question research study , please contact : David Hasan , MD , 319-331-1459 . If experience research-related injury , please contact : David Hasan MD , 319-331-1459 .
