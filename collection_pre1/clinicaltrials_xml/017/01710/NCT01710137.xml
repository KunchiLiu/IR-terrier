	<brief_title>Varenicline Nicotine Dependence Among Those With HIV/AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among people diagnosed HIV/AIDS , widespread use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) greatly improve survival rate change leading cause death , AIDS-related disease ( e.g. , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , Kaposi sarcoma ) , cardiovascular disease lung cancer . As , address modifiable risk factor disease mortality among HIV/AIDS , include tobacco use , become critical priority . To date , three smoke cessation clinical trial conduct HIV/AIDS none investigate efficacy FDA-approved medication nicotine dependence . Varenicline α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist great efficacy treat nicotine dependence bupropion nicotine patch . Varenicline may particularly efficacious treat nicotine dependence among individual HIV/AIDS give depression symptom cognitive impairment common population , increase smoke abstinence predict smoking relapse , significantly reduce varenicline . Therefore , investigator conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial varenicline smoker HIV/AIDS . Specifically , 310 smoker HIV/AIDS randomize varenicline plus 9 week smoke cessation counsel placebo plus 9 week smoke cessation counseling . The primary outcome variable study 7-day biochemically confirm tobacco abstinence week 12 24 . Secondary outcome include : prolonged abstinence week 12 , 18 , 24 ( relapse define 7 consecutive day self-reported smoking , 2-week grace period ) , continuous abstinence week 12 24 ( e.g. , smoke quit day follow-up ) , time 7-day relapse ( grace period ) , lapse recovery event . The trial result may support use varenicline treatment nicotine dependence among HIV/AIDS , thereby reduce tobacco-related morbidity mortality population .</detailed_description>
