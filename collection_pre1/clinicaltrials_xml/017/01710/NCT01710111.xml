	<brief_summary>The way influenza transmitted people uncertain; example , know large droplet fine particle ( aerosol ) matter most; produce cough sneeze . This mean say precaution work best real life . Improving understanding vital allow development guideline policy help reduce transmission pandemic seasonal flu . The aim study explore influenza spread , specifically look importance spread via small particle ( aerosols/droplet nucleus ) carry respiratory spray e.g . produce cough sneezing . The primary objective study : To estimate contribution aerosols/droplet nuclei influenza transmission determine secondary attack rate ( SAR ) influenza Recipients randomise control arm ( intervention - allow mode transmission ) compare Recipients randomise intervention arm ( face shield hand hygiene - allow transmission aerosols/droplet nucleus ) group Recipients expose Donor volunteer infect influenza via intranasal drop . The hypothesis : The SAR low Recipients expose aerosols/droplet nucleus ( intervention arm ) compare expose mode transmission ( control arm ) : aerosols/droplet nucleus , droplet spray ( large respiratory droplet ) transmission contact .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Modes Influenza Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study take place quarantine facility . Some volunteer ( Donors ) infect influenza virus via droplet nose . Other volunteer ( Recipients ) expose occupy room ( day time ) take part certain activity e.g . play card game . Some Recipients wear face shield clean hand regularly time Donors . The wear face shield together good hand hygiene reduce spread infection large respiratory droplet contact contaminate surface prevent infection occur aerosols air . Use symptom diary diagnostic test influenza allow presence subsequent illness identify . Volunteers require participate quarantine facility approximately 13 day ( typically 9 Donors 13 day Recipients ) , plus study screen clinic followup . Additionally , study , environmental sampling perform look presence influenza virus . Air sample swab surface object may provide information enable u good understand route transmission .</detailed_description>
