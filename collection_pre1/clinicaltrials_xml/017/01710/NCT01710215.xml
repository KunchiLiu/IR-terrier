	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) 2nd lead cause cancer death US , though CRC death reduce screening . However , uncertainty screen strategy clinically cost-effective population perspective aim optimize completion entire screening process continuum . Modeling study suggest benefit harm colonoscopy stool blood test strategy similar , generally assume 100 % participation subsequent clinically appropriate follow -- something never achieve clinical practice . Comparative effectiveness study test strategy , include comparison specific test approach optimize effective test use , necessary . Safety-net health system care population increase risk adverse CRC outcomes , uninsured minority , limited resource . Therefore , safety-nets must resolve uncertainty regard effective screening strategy . The investigator conduct system-level , randomize comparative effectiveness trial benefit , harm , cost 3 screen strategy 3 year , among 6000 patient age 50-64 year , up-to-date CRC screening , serve large safety net health system . The three strategy study : 1 ) Fecal immunochemical testing , annual mail invitation outreach ( include test kit ) , centralized process promote participation complete clinical follow ( FIT ) ; 2 ) Colonoscopy , annual mail invitation outreach , centralized process promote participation complete clinical follow ( Colo ) ; 3 ) Usual Care , mail invitation outreach , screen offer primary care visit . The primary measure benefit outcome measure summarize patient-specific effective screening success . The primary measure harm screen non-participation . The primary measure cost cost per-patient effectively screen . Our specific aim : 1 ) Compare benefit , harm , cost FIT strategy versus Colo strategy CRC screening among patient up-to-date screening , 2 ) Compare benefit , harm , cost ) FIT strategy vs. Usual Care b ) Colo strategy vs. Usual Care CRC screening .</brief_summary>
