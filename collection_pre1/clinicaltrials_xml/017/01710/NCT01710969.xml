	<brief_summary>The plan study randomly assign aggressive child one two version Coping Power child component . The two version Coping Power either deliver child component program usual small group format ( Group Coping Power : GCP ) newly-developed individual format ( Individual Coping Power : ICP ) . By provide direct comparison two different format intervention , plan study 's design fill critical gap current understanding relative effectiveness group vs. individual program . Further , study allow examination specific factor influence relative effectiveness two format , important information broad implication program development , training clinician , intervention implementation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : The study test hypothesis Coping Power intervention produce large effect size deliver individual format comparison group format . Although advantage format , pilot data suggest group format may diminish strength outcome effect intervention comparison intervention deliver individual format . This pilot data consistent prior finding , direct randomize comparison child assign group versus individual format conduct , despite critically important conceptual , clinical , policy implication . Hypothesis 1-1 : It hypothesize ICP produce great reduction behavior outcome include substance use , externalize behavior problem , delinquency 1-year follow-up , comparison GCP . Hypothesis 1-2 : hypothesize ICP condition produce great improvement child 's social competence , directly target intervention , comparison GCP . Specific Aim 2 : Individual group variation effect size outcome youth behavior group ( i.e. , deviancy training ) group leader behavior management skill . We see youth behavior highly influenced group leader management practice . We understand group and/or individual child present challenge even competent group leader , therefore , variation observable meaningful . The design study allow test group level individual effect , linkage effect specific behavior . Such information provide empirical basis clinical training group intervention youth general Coping Power particular . Hypothesis 2-1 : It hypothesize peer escalation GCP condition predict bad outcome , level group deviance GCP condition moderate effectiveness GCP condition , good outcome effect group high initial screening score . Hypothesis 2-2 : It hypothesize group intervention compromise individual child 's reaction interpersonal dynamic group , inadvertent attention deviant behavior talk provide group member and/or group leader . Hypothesis 2-3 : It hypothesize level positive group leader behavior ( direct attention rule , correct behavior , provide praise compliance , introduction review activity , clear direction ) moderate effectiveness GCP condition . Specific Aim 3 : Variability outcome score differ condition . Hypothesis 3-1 : It hypothesize great variability outcome score child GCP condition child ICP condition . Specific Aim 4 : Child characteristic examine potential moderator intervention effect . Hypothesis 4-1 : It hypothesize youth low effortful control vulnerable deviancy effect group intervention therefore show lower effect size youth high effortful control baseline . Thus expect effortful control function moderator group intervention effectiveness , individual intervention effectiveness . Research Question 1 : In addition , investigate possibility characteristic youth 's decision-making ( impulsive decision-making ; outcome expectation ) , affective arousal ( callous-unemotional trait ; low physiological arousal response negative consequence ) , temperament behavior characteristic ( baseline severity aggressive behavior ) ; perceive actual peer reaction ( perceive peer competence ; peer rejection ; peer victimization ; deviant peer ) demographic characteristic ( sex ; age ; race ) moderate effectiveness intervention .</detailed_description>
