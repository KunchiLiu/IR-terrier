	<detailed_description>Endometrial cervical cancer one common malignancy see female genital tract . Although , surgical resection treatment choice , adjuvant neo-adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy curative radiotherapy alternative treatment option depend stage . Identification recurrent disease early phase carry primary importance prognosis . Diffusion-weighted MRI ( DWI ) , new technique recently start perform body image potential ability distinguish recurrent disease normal tissue fibrosis . Our aim study investigate diagnostic impact DWI detection recurrence rate patient treat curative surgery endometrial cervical cancer . All patient curative surgery due endometrial cervical cancer include study . Patients examine DWI addition routine sequence include contrast enhance dynamic study . The sensitivity , specificity , accuracy well positive negative predictive value study investigate data derive DWI study correlate data obtain conventional radiologic , nuclear image study include PET-CT , well pathologic verification follow-up period .</detailed_description>
