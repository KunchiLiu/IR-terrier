	<brief_title>Misoprostol Oxytocin Uniject® Postpartum Hemorrhage Prevention Communities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Research : Approximately 30 % maternal death India attribute postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) . The common cause PPH uterine atony ( failure uterus contract properly childbirth ) . Administration uterotonic drug active management third stage labor ( AMTSL ) significantly reduce rate PPH . Oxytocin consider drug choice prevention PPH . However , always feasible administer parenteral Oxytocin resource-poor setting give cold storage , sterile equipment , skilled personnel , administration requirement . Recently , Oxytocin Uniject® , pre-filled , non-refillable easy use device single measure dose find equally effective safer convenient use traditional needle syringe . Misoprostol explore prevent PPH setting parenteral uterotonics yet available feasible use . In 2007 , World Health Organisation guideline prevention PPH endorse administration oral Misoprostol PPH prevention unskilled provider `` train use setting Active management third stage labor ( AMTSL ) practice '' . In spite evidence clinical safety efficacy oral Misoprostol and/or Oxytocin Uniject® universal PPH prevention drug , date , study compare programmatic effectiveness either technology large scale nationwide PPH prevention program . To address gap , investigator plan conduct large community-based trial collaboration Aga Khan Health Services , India . Study Objectives : The study assess feasibility , cost , risk benefit use oral Misoprostol parenteral Oxytocin Uniject® prophylaxis PPH community setting . Study Design : The study design community-based cluster Randomised Control Trial . The study enroll woman deliver Primary Health Centres ( PHCs ) . Study centre assign one following : Group 1 : 600 mcg oral Misoprostol , Group 2 : 10 IU IM Oxytocin deliver Uniject® . Study Procedures 1 . Informed consent /Enrollment : Women approach trained study staff third trimester present delivery ask wish participate study . Women meet study 's eligibility criterion agree participate ask provide write consent . After enrollment , baseline data record pre-delivery hemoglobin assessment do . 2 . At time delivery : Standard procedures manage delivery follow . Immediately delivery , participant give assign study medication ( either Misoprostol Oxytocin Uniject® ) . The provider monitor woman side effect 1 - 2 hour delivery . Referrals carry per standard care set document . 3 . After delivery : The follow visit conduct trained community health worker . Post-delivery Hb record woman approximately 72 hour delivery . Women 's experience side effect , acceptability satisfaction care document . Study Site Sample : The study conduct Jamnagar district Gujarat , India . Twenty seven PHCs consider eligible participation . To detect significant difference ( pre- post-delivery Hb ) two prophylactic regimen 0.1 g/dL ( SD 0.3 g/dL ) , also adjust cluster design , total sample approximately 1500 delivery plan ( 750 delivery per group ) . Study Medications : Both drug Uniject device obtain pharmaceutical company compliance good manufacturing procedure . Gynuity responsible supply re-supplying medication throughout study monitor logistics related supply . Ethical consideration : Both drug safe , effective evidence-based prophylactic uterotonics prevent PPH . However , protocol approve relevant Institutional Review Boards prior enrollment study participant . Only authorize study personnel access study supply document . Monitoring Evaluation : An independent data safety monitor board review data periodically make recommendation investigator concern study modification , need .</detailed_description>
