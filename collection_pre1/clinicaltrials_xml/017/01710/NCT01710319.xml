	<brief_summary>The purpose research study investigate difference `` natural killer ( NK ) blood cell , type white blood cell fight infection body , among different type patient lung surgery . The four different group patient : - smoker lung cancer - smoker without lung cancer - non-smokers lung cancer - non-smokers without lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research show different strain mice posse vary susceptibility lung cancer . C3H C57BL6 mouse highly resistant lung cancer , whereas A/J 129 mouse susceptible lung cancer . Data lab show mice different number natural killer ( NK ) cell well different characteristic cell . C3H C57BL6 mouse high number NK cell well high expression CD11b , whereas A/J 129 mouse low number low expression . These finding justify parallel investigation NK cell human population resistant susceptible lung cancer . Through blood sample , circulate NK cell count phenotypically analyze . Smoking used factor establish lung cancer risk . Additionally , non-smokers suffer lung cancer provide opportunity investigate whether lung cancer patient low abundance NK cell less expression CD11b , independent effect smoke . Objective : The main goal study investigate quantitative phenotypic difference circulate NK cell among human population . Participants classify heavy smoker ( HS ) , non-smokers ( NS ) , suffer lung cancer ( LC ) , free lung cancer ( NC ) . Hypothesis # 1 : NS/LC participant few NK cell low expression CD11b compare HS/NC NS/NC participant . Hypothesis # 2 : NS/LC participant numerous NK cell high expression CD11b compare HS/LC participant .</detailed_description>
