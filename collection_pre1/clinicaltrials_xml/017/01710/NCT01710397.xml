This study randomize strategy evaluation feasibility , effectiveness , cost-effectiveness rapid ART initiation . Outpatient , non-pregnant , HIV-positive adult come South African clinic HIV test , consent study participation , eligible ART randomize 1:1 rapid ART initiation standard care . Those assigned rapid ART initiation possibility receive first dose ARVs early day , assign standard care follow clinic 's usual procedure start ART . Rapid ART initiation HIV-positive pregnant woman , recently become standard care South Africa , also assess programmatic evaluation conduct alongside randomize evaluation , retrospective comparison group . The primary study outcome non-pregnant adult remain alive , care virally suppress 10 month positive HIV test study site make first HIV-related visit . The primary study outcome pregnant woman adherence ART delivery . The cost effectiveness rapid initiation strategy assess cost per patient achieve primary outcome population .</brief_summary>
