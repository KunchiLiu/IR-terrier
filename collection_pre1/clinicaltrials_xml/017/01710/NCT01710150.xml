	<brief_summary>The purpose compare long term occurrence atrial arrhythmia include atrial fibrillation ( AF ) thromboembolic complication include cerebrovascular event ( CVE ) patient typical atrial flutter ( AFLT ) undergo cavo-tricuspid isthmus ( CTI ) ablation alone versus CTI ablation combine pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Vein Isolation To Reduce Future Risk Of Atrial Fibrillation In Patients Undergoing Typical Flutter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typical Atrial Flutter ( AFLT ) common cardiac arrhythmia . Studies demonstrate safety superiority ablation procedure antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD ) therapy . Long term freedom typical AFLT consistently show successful ablation , 30 % patient experience new onset different arrhythmia i.e. , Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) . AF result trigger back leave upper chamber heart ( left atrium - LA ) . These trigger typically arise around open 4 vein ( pulmonary vein - PVs ) bring blood lung heart . The high incidence AF patient undergo ablation typical AFLT observe follow-up duration exceed year AFLT ablation . This would suggest AF development patient undergo typical AFLT ablation progressive inevitable .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient typical AFLT confirm 12lead ECG refer ablation manifest ≥ 2 risk factor associate future development AF eligible participate study . Risk factor predict future occurrence AF include : 1. prior remote history AF ( ≤ 2 episode ≥ 1 year date evaluation study participation ) , 2 . LA size &gt; 4.0 cm , 3. leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≤ 50 % , 4. hypertension , and/or 5 ) obstructive sleep apnea . 1 . Subjects document ≥ 2 AF episode within precede 6 month enrollment , 2. inability unwillingness take 6 week oral anticoagulation procedure 3. failure provide inform consent .</criteria>
