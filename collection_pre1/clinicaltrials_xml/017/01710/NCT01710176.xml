	<brief_summary>This randomized Phase III clinical trial set localize high-risk soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) . This study compare standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy epirubicin plus ifosfamide versus histology-driven chemotherapy , i.e . chemotherapy tailor specific histology within family adult STS . Chemotherapy administer 3 cycle . There five histological group ( represent 80 % STS ) , follow : leiomyosarcoma , myxoid liposarcoma hypercellularity ( round cell MLPS ) , synovial sarcoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma . The histology-driven chemotherapy group , respectively , gemcitabine plus dacarbazine , trabectedin , high-dose ifosfamide , ifosfamide plus etoposide , gemcitabine plus docetaxel . Other histological group also include register , treated standard chemotherapy . Patients already undergone definitive surgery receive treatment post-operatively patient need re-excision inadequate surgery treat patient two group , course evaluable response . A centralized pathological review perform . Radiological response evaluate accord RECIST Choi criterion . Pathological response also record . The endpoint disease-free survival ( DFS ) , secondarily , overall survival ( OS ) patient receive standard chemotherapy versus receive histotype-tailored chemotherapy . Additional aim compare probability response standard v histotype-tailored chemotherapy determine radiological pathological response standard chemotherapy v tailor chemotherapy different histological group . Another aim validate response ( radiological pathological ) preoperative chemotherapy surrogate endpoint DFS OS . Three hundred patient randomized 3-years period , pool 400-450 registered patient . Translational research perform . Areas research include identification validation potential predictive marker histological subgroup . The study design verify statistical hypothesis histotype-tailored approach associate , overall , 30 % reduction hazard relapse . However , different histological group , effect histotype-tailored chemotherapy , compare standard chemotherapy , different . To address weakness orthogonal study response chemotherapy surrogate DFS OS introduce trial . This study intend extensively investigate response ( radiological pathological ) preoperative chemotherapy validate surrogate endpoint show correlate disease free survival overall survival .</brief_summary>
