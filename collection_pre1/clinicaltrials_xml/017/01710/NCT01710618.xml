	<brief_summary>The purpose study elucidate different protein may appear `` injured '' end sciatic nerve compare end cut nerve , `` uninjured '' . By compare `` normal '' versus `` traumatized '' end cut sciatic nerve , investigator hope identify protein may specifically relate pain . For instance , non-traumatized end nerve none Protein X traumatize end nerve lot Protein X , Protein X would protein investigator want study see play role sensation pain . Other study show specific pain-related protein may increase decreased traumatic injury . If investigator able identify specific protein related pain , may eventually lead development medication block protein decrease sensation pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects schedule final amputation revision closure ( ) approach participate study . On day study participant 's plan amputation revision , research staff liaise surgical staff coordinate nerve specimen retrieval . If patient knee amputation , sciatic nerve specimen obtain , patient knee knee amputation , tibial nerve specimen obtain ( major component sciatic nerve divide tibial peroneal nerve popliteal fossa knee ) . The surgeon place suture proximal end specimen indicate non-traumatized end nerve , well provide estimate longitudinal location nerve sample ( i.e . 10cm distal knee joint line , 15 cm proximal knee knee joint level ) . Each sample excise manner - use scalpel . Once tissue excise surgeon , place plastic test tube label subject ' study identification number ( suffix `` A '' `` B '' two sample retrieve subject ) , transferred member research staff immediately frozen liquid nitrogen . The frozen specimen deliver Department Research Programs laboratory store -80°C prior analysis . The promixal , middle , distal sample obtain DRP lab remain segment nerve replace -80 freezer future analysis . Samples send Duke University processing analysis via secure air mail carrier . The task processing sample perform immediately prior mass spectroscopy analysis colleague Duke University . Collaborator Dr Moseley 's lab responsibility include protein extraction assay . The number extraction per sample vary depending length , 2 50 . Collaborator Dr Van de ven 's lab responsibility include sample handling , pathologic examination , remove thin slice histologic examination segment homogenization RNA , DNA protein extraction . Individual segment thaw ice homogenize immediately upon thaw . Homogenization method optimize produce high dissolved protein content . Methods trialed include sonication , mechanical disruption laboratory blender , mechanical disruption manual chopping follow Potter device , freeze thawing . Buffer solvent system variable trialed include salt concentration , pH buffer type , chaotrope concentration ( urea thiourea ) , presence organic co-solvents DMSO , presence nonionic detergent . All homogenization perform 0 4°C presence protease inhibitor . For proteomic analysis , High-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry employ complementary route discover difference protein expression healthy traumatize tissue . Following solid-phase extraction soluble solubilized protein , optimize condition separation protein peak detect UV absorbance and/or total ion current may employ one set condition order focus different set extract protein . We use high-porosity C-18 reversed-phase column separate cytosolic protein , C-4 membrane protein . Standard method ionization , fragmentation , detection use consistent Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF mass spectrometer Research Operations Service ( ROS ) . For RNA analysis , extract RNA bring Duke Center Genomic Computational Biology Genomic Technologies core . There , RNA quality determine use Agilent 2100bioanalyzer follow Affymetrix GeneChip analysis . David Corcoran , biostatistician work Duke Center Genomic Computational Biology , perform data analysis . In study , change standard care implement . The sciatic nerve specimen would otherwise discard human tissue ; ongoing investigation use specimen . Following analysis sciatic nerve , collect data - demographic , injury , pain treatment information , well pre-operative pain score - subject ' chart determine secondary outcome variable .
