	<brief_title>Evaluation Regional Ventilation Using 19F MRI Inert Perfluorinated Gases Mixed With Oxygen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate utilization conventional 'thermally ' polarize perfluorinated gas mixed oxygen exogenous inert contrast agent image airway space normal diseased human lung . This open label proof concept study expand work group animal ex-vivo human lung study human subject gas . Projection image ( 2-dimensional ) 3D image obtain use 19F MRI couple spirometry breathe maneuver correlate spirometry variable ( e.g . FEV1 FEV1/FVC ) regional distribution gas .</detailed_description>
