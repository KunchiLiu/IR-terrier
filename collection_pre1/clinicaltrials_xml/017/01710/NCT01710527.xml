	<brief_title>BE Study Metformin GSK 500mg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sample Size Estimation Assuming formulation ratio ( T/R ) 95-105 % maximum observable intra subject variability Metformin 22 % ( base literature ) , sample size 29 subject would sufficient prove bioequivalence two formulation power least 90 % . Hence , total 32 subject enrol study consider withdrawal dropout . Hence , 32 healthy adult human male subject enrol . Adverse Events The investigator site staff responsible detecting , document report event meet definition AE SAE . AEs collect start Study Treatment follow-up contact . Medical occurrence begin prior start study treatment obtain informed consent may record Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF . SAEs collect time period state AEs . However , SAEs assess related study participation ( e.g . study treatment , protocol-mandated procedure , invasive test , change exist therapy ) relate GSK concomitant medication record time subject consent participate study include follow-up contact . All SAEs record report sponsor within 24 hour . Investigators obligate actively seek AEs SAEs former study participant . However , investigator learns SAE , include death , time subject discharge study , considers event reasonably related study treatment study participation , investigator would promptly notify sponsor . All serious adverse event inform sponsor within 24 hr IEC within 7 working day . Any unexpected serious adverse event ( SAE ) occur clinical trial communicate promptly ( within 14 calendar day ) Sponsor/CRO Licensing Authority . Any follow-up information previously report SAE also report sponsor within 24 hour . If investigator information regard SAE , he/she wait receive additional information notify sponsor event complete appropriate data collection tool . The investigator always provide assessment causality time initial report . Screening procedure : Demographic data , medical medication history , complete physical examination , height , weight BMI well 12 lead ECG , chest X-ray [ PA view ] , vital sign [ blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate oral temperature ] , hematology , biochemistry , HIV 1 &amp; 2 , Hepatitis B C , RPR test Syphilis urine analysis do screening . Urine drug screen , Liver chemistry test breath alcohol test do prior check-in . Breath alcohol test do prior ambulatory visit blood collection . Liver chemistry test do end period . Housing : The study subject house least 11 h prior drug administration 24 h blood sample study period . The housing follow one ambulatory visit [ 36.0 hr post dose ] period . Washout : At least 7 day , exceed 14 day two dosing day . Treatment arm : Test : A single dose Metformin 500 mg tablet manufacture Savipharm J.S.C , Vietnam . Reference : A single dose Glucophage® 500 mg tablet Merck Sante , France Drug administration : As per randomization schedule , one tablet either test reference product orally administer subject period sit posture , overnight fast least 10 h. To avoid hypoglycemic episode , investigational product administer 240 mL 20 % glucose solution water , follow 60 mL glucose solution administer every 15 min 4 h dosing . Subjects instruct chew crush tablet swallow . Compliance dose assessed identification subject subject ID card , identification label investigational product confirm correct allocation treatment check oral cavity immediately dose . Restrictions : Subjects remain upright position [ sit ambulatory ] two hour dose period except clinically indicate change posture . The subject fast least 10 h prior dose 4 h post-dose . Water permit ad libitum except 1 h 1 h post dose . During 1 hr post dose water restriction , 60 mL 20 % glucose solution administer every 15 min study subject . In period study , 18 blood sample 6 mL collect K2EDTA vacutainers via indwell catheter place one forearm vein . Heparin-lock technique use prevent clot blood indwelling catheter . Before in-house blood sample drawn catheter , 0.5 mL blood discard purge heparin contain blood sample catheter . Blood also collect direct venipuncture case cannula blockage , ambulatory visit practical reason . The two pre-dose blood sample collect within period 1 h drug administration . The post-dose blood sample collect 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0 , 8.0 , 10.0 , 12.0 , 16.0 , 24.0 36.0 h. The 36.0 h post dose blood sample collect ambulatory visit direct venipuncture . Immediately collection blood , sample keep ice bath . After collect blood sample subject sampling time point , sample centrifuge 4oC 3500 rpm 10 minute . The plasma sample separate store pre-labeled polypropylene tube -70 ± 10°C pending assay . The time interval sample collection start centrifugation exceed 45 minute . The blood sample collection , process analysis do sodium monochromatic light . The total volume blood drawn include volume necessary laboratory test , PK sample analysis volume blood discard house blood draw 250 mL per subject entire study . Subjects monitoring : Brief physical examination vital sign [ blood pressure , pulse rate oral temperature ] carry recorded check-in check-out . Vital sign [ blood pressure pulse rate ] also record dose investigational product , 2 - 3 , 9 - 10 36.0 h post dose . Vital sign do sit position rest least 5 minute . Physical examination measurement vital sign also carry time conduct study Investigator/Doctor feel necessary . In case abnormality pre-dose vital sign , Investigator base medical judgement take decision whether dose subject . During vitals record subject ask well-being . Also subject well-being questionnaire perform 1.0 5.0 h post dose . Post-study Procedures : Safety evaluation [ complete physical examination , vital sign , hematology [ except blood grouping &amp; Rh type ] biochemistry ] do end clinical part study . In case withdrawal study safety assessment do time withdrawal . In case dropout subject ask visit facility undergo safety assessment . Pharmacokinetic Parameters : Cmax , Tmax , AUC0-t , AUC0-∞ , AUC % _Extrap , Kel t1/2 Analytical Methods : Metformin plasma estimate use validated LC-MS/MS method . Statistical Methods : Statistical analysis do use SAS® version 9.2 high . Analysis variance [ ANOVA ] log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter [ Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ ] , two one-sided test [ Schuirmann ] bioequivalence , power , ratio 90 % confidence interval log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter - Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ perform . Standards Bioequivalence : The calculated 90 % Confidence Interval test reference ratio Metformin fall within range 80 % -125 % log transform Cmax , AUC0-t AUC0-∞ conclusion bioequivalence .</detailed_description>
