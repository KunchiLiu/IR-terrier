	<brief_summary>Using glucocorticoid induce diabetes ( GID ) conduct small feasibility randomize intervention trial improve GID management veteran prescribe chronic glucocorticoid . Approximately 20 primary care provider ( care approximately 100 veteran chronic steroid ) receive decisional support ( automatically-derived order hemoglobin A1C , co-signed provider ) . Approximately 20 provider ( care 100 veteran ) receive decisional support serve control population . We measure time randomization provider sign order hemoglobin A1C group . The trial conduct VA 's Eastern Colorado Health Care System ( ECHCS ) last approximately 6 month . After completion trial provider , conduct brief interview survey participate provider assess acceptability decisional support intervention manage GID [ protocol , page 1-2 ] . No patient data ( PHI ) collect provider .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Conduct single site randomize controlled feasibility trial decisional support intervention reduce ADRLLS improve provider ' adherence GID prevention measure . Approximately 20 primary care provider ( care approximately 100 veteran chronic steroid screen diabetes last year ) randomly assign receive decisional support GID prevention measure ( automatically-derived order hemoglobin A1C , co-signed provider ) . These provider compare 20 provider ( care 100 veteran screen diabetes last year ) randomly assign receive decisional support management GID ( i.e . control group ) . The trial conduct VA 's Eastern Colorado Health Care System ( ECHCS ) last approximately 6 month . Study administration coordinate Colorado Research Award Enhancement Program ( Colorado REAP ) . Aim 1a ) Procedural Endpoints : As feasibility trial , study include multiple procedural endpoint , provider participation rate , assess viability intervention , rather single primary efficacy outcome measure ( detail , page 6-7 ) . Aim 1b ) Preliminary Estimates Efficacy : We determine Delay Intervalâ€”the number day provider randomized provider order GID prevention measure . Use continuous measure maximize power feasibility study , though also determine proportion patient measure order six month , may estimate sample size subsequent multi-center randomize control trial . Aim 1c ) Post-trial de-briefing : Using structured interview , examine opinion provider participate GID feasibility trial , order gather additional qualitative data regard ADRLL framework refine intervention subsequent randomize controlled trial . Providers also complete brief survey assess preference intervention .</detailed_description>
