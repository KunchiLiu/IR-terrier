	<brief_summary>Iodinated contrast current gold standard infrainguinal angiography image patient without renal insufficiency also use intravascular Optical Coherence Tomography ( iOCT ) improve image quality human coronary artery well carotid artery . The current debate literature iOCT medium iodinate contrast dextran CO2 may offer superior method iOCT image low extremity occlusive disease intervention . The investigator hypothesize CO2 medium injection iOCT data acquisition feasible produce least quality image obtain contrast dextran without cause problem volume overload renal toxicity see two latter medium . Primary Outcomes Measured - Quality : Cumulative number clear image frame ( CIF ) entire 54mm length segment . - Quantitative : Calculations area diameter segment measure determine index refraction effect three medium test . The investigator expect find little difference three iOCT medium hope conclude CO2 offer superior side effect profile iOCT image low extremity arterial system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) affect anywhere 8-12 Million people United States . Many people go develop claudication , rest pain , tissue loss . During workup disease state many image modality conduct include Pulse Volume Recording , Duplex Ultrasound , Angiography , IVUS , emerge catheter base image developed may supplement current modality use . Intravascular optical coherence tomography ( iOCT ) base near-infrared light system . The light reflect plaque object within vessel signal process series axial image ( A-scans ) different position along artery generate two-dimensional dataset ( B-scans ) . These image create extremely fine resolution 10-15 Î¼m , allow iOCT use many research setting include PAD coronary artery disease . OCT approve clinical use coronary territory FDA May 2010 . Since many center use iOCT daily clinical practice . However , 's still widely clinical management patient PAD . There hope high resolution capability iOCT may help intervention predict outcome correct error stent deployment . The iOCT procedure lower extremity PAD fairly straightforward . An introducer place femoral artery . After wire place past lesion interest iOCT catheter insert . The catheter attach automated pullback device . Next optical medium need displace erythrocyte . Due high resolution iOCT necessary clean image analyze . At time injection optical medium sensor trigger catheter withdrawn ( distal proximal ) anywhere 10-25 mm/sec . The image capture processed arterial plaque characterize . The great strength iOCT catheter high resolution image problem image signal substantially attenuate blood . In order remedy complication technique proximal balloon occlusion continuous infusion fluid use acquire improved iOCT image . In continuous infusion method , different medium inject contrast , dextran , even oxygen-carrying substitute hope improve decrease attenuation blood . In order overcome attenuation red blood cell iOCT imaging , propose novel approach involve CO2 injection clear erythrocyte . Currently CO2 use medium digital subtraction angiography patient renal insufficiency first use human Hawkins 1982 . The alternative angiography , iodinate contrast medium , nephrotoxic thus avoid patient fear exacerbate patient 's acute chronic problem . Another group CO2 angiography employed history contrast allergy . Although technique usually use circumstance , Kerns et al report conduct CO2 angiography high 20 % patient abdominal low extremity study . In addition benefit patient allergy renal insufficiency , CO2 extremely safe variety arterial venous application . It 20 time soluble room air expire lung first-pass-type effect . The current contraindication CO2 digital subtraction angiography cerebral arterial circulation never expose CO2 possible neurotoxicity . Relative contraindication include use presence large arteriovenous shunt , nitrous oxide anesthesia , use cautiously patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Dextran use past critical care set human volume expander rare side effect anaphylaxis nephrotoxicity . It also use human coronary artery iOCT blood displacement medium . Finally use iOCT proximal occlusion model . The main complaint final study burn sensation last &lt; 10 . Iodinated contrast current gold standard infrainguinal angiography image patient without renal insufficiency also use iOCT improve image quality human coronary artery well carotid artery . The current debate literature iOCT medium iodinate contrast dextran CO2 may offer superior method iOCT image low extremity occlusive disease intervention .</detailed_description>
