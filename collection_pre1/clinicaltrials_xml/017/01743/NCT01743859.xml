	<brief_title>Azacitidine Lenalidomide Relapsed Refractory Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AML patient relapse refractory disease poor outcome . Sequential azacitidine lenalidomide recently show PI study well-tolerated effective elderly , treatment naïve AML patient . Observations study others pilot combination suggest patient receive failed prior treatment may also respond regimen . Therefore , sequential combination azacitidine lenalidomide could potentially improve outcome relapsed refractory AML patient provide treatment option tolerable potentially clinically synergistic . To determine efficacy combination population , pilot phase 2 study .</detailed_description>
