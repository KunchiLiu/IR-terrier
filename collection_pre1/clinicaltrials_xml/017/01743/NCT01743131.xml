	<brief_title>Abatacept GVHD Prophylaxis Phase 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Graft versus Host Disease ( aGvHD ) deadly complication face child allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . aGvHD occur , large part , T cell bone marrow graft `` accept '' presence transplant recipient 's cell . They mount severe , debilitating , often deadly attack recipient , strike skin , liver , gastrointestinal track , prominently . For patient receive bone marrow unrelated donor , rate aGvHD reach high 80 % , half patient die complication . Given lack success prevent aGvHD current therapy , novel therapy prevent disease desperately need . Hypothesis Aims : This trial conduct step toward test long-term hypothesis costimulation blockade agent abatacept added standard acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGvHD ) prophylaxis regimen ( include calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) methotrexate ) , improve disease-free survival unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) patient hematologic malignancy . As phase II study , overall aim trial make preliminary assessment abatacept 's clinical safety efficacy use short-term outcome . Thus , trial design test two hypothesis : 1 . A primary hypothesis addition abatacept calcineurin inhibition + methotrexate decrease incidence early-onset ( day 100 post-transplant ) severe ( grade 3-4 ) aGvHD . 2 . A secondary hypothesis addition hinder post-transplant reconstitution protective immunity latent virus . To test two hypothesis , study follow Specific Aims . Specific Aim # 1 : To conduct multicenter Phase II , randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial ass impact abatacept incidence aGVHD biology . To make assessment patient randomize either standard aGVHD prophylaxis CNI , methotrexate placebo investigational prophylaxis CNI , methotrexate abatacept . Correlative immunology study perform elucidate abatacept 's effect graft-versus-host response . Specific Aim # 2 : To assess impact abatacept post-transplant reconstitution protective immunity virus . This involve monitor longitudinal recovery lymphocyte subset virus-specific immunity , use tetramer analysis viral stimulation assay . It also involve monitor viral infection disease . Background Rationale : The Unmet Need : Allogeneic HSCT effective treatment aggressive leukemias hematological malignancy , often represent option cure . However , benefit , especially case unrelated donor transplantation , off-set high rate transplant-related mortality ( approximately 30 % recipient unrelated donor transplantation die transplant-related complication ) stem largely severe aGVHD infection . 1-7 aGvHD occur reconstitute donor T cells8 become activate recipient tissues.9 This activation result severe immune-mediated tissue damage host , skin , liver GI tract common target . aGvHD-mediated damage vital organ result significant morbidity , death . While whole-scale T cell depletion allograft successfully reduce rate aGvHD , patient receive T cell-depleted graft exhibit profound defect protective immunity , often die infection relapse primary disease.10-12 This create unmet clinical need strategy effectively prevent severe aGvHD preserve transplant recipient 's protective immune response . Targeting T cell costimulation prevent aGvHD : The immune activation observe aGvHD bear close resemblance immune activation occur organ rejection autoimmunity . Studies diseases lead development new class agent , call 'costimulation blockade ' reagent , specifically target activated T cell block ability become fully activated effector cell . 13 One study costimulatory pathway CD28 : CD80/86 receptor : coreceptor interaction.14 Considerable work pathway accomplish , demonstrate efficacy inhibition CD28 : CD80/86 signal inhibit T cell-mediated immune activation . The first CD80/86-directed costimulation blockade agent , CTLA4Ig , 'abatacept , ' approve use rheumatoid arthritis , adult child older 6 years.15-18 The experience abatacept 3 large randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial , two adult rheumatoid arthritis one child juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( age 6 older ) indicate safe agent.19-21 In three trial , abatacept dosed 10 mg/kg administer IV day 1 , 15 , 29 ( one trial use day 30 ) every 28 day total 6 10 month total treatment . Collectively , patient also receive weekly , oral , low-dose methotrexate low dose prednisone concurrently . In trial , abatacept well tolerate . Acutely , infusional reaction rare mild occurred rate differ significantly placebo . Abatacept associate hematologic , renal , cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic neurologic abnormality . Similarly , rate total serious adverse event low , differ placebo . Abatacept show safe , even extend open label trials,22,23 associate excessive PTLD malignancy . 22-25 However , chronically-treated patient experience slightly high risk infection . 22,24,25 Phase III study second-generation , high avidity abatacept analog , belatacept ( identical abatacept except two amino acid substitution ) demonstrate efficacy prevent renal transplant rejection . 26,27 Patients receive 10mg/kg belatacept day 1 , 5 , 14 , 28 , every 28 day thereafter demonstrate improved renal function compare receive cyclosporine , similar graft survival.26,27 These result lead FDA approval belatacept renal transplant indication . While overall rate patient death , infection serious infection patient receive belatacept different receive traditional immunosuppression,26,28 belatacept associated statistically-significant increase rate EBV-associated PTLD compare cyclosporine-based immunosuppression ( especially patient EBV sero-negative prior transplant ) .26,28 This observation raise important question negative impact belatacept related compound may protective immune response latent virus . Rates PTLD much low EBV sero-positive patients,26,28 suggest defect protective immunity induce belatacept may significant set primary EBV infection EBV reactivation . These observation underscore critical importance evaluate novel immunosuppressive strategy impact alloreactivity post-transplant protective immune response . Prior work , abatacept test ability prevent GvHD BMT patient . However , considerable evidence murine model suggest might active compound immune activation occur GvHD.29-33 In addition , research group develop non-human primate model GvHD 34 use model demonstrate abatacept-containing immunosuppressive regimen could significantly protect development primate GvHD . 34 These result , along clinical evidence efficacy abatacept belatacept autoimmunity solid organ transplantation provide rationale development first-in-disease feasibility trial abatacept GvHD prevention ( Clinical Trials.org # NCT01012492 ) . This trial , complete enrollment , document encouraging early result respect safety efficacy abatacept GvHD prevention ( Kean et al. , ASH 2011 ) . These result lead creation current Phase II clinical trial abatacept prevention severe aGvHD .
