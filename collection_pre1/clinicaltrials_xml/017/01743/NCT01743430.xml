	<brief_summary>Study 1 : Background Purpose—This study set telerehabilitation program stand balance training , examine training effect balance daily activity subject subacute stroke.The null hypothesis include telerehabilitation balance train significantly different conventional balance training subject subacute stroke . Study 2 : The purpose study investigate effect telerehabilitation group therapy balance daily activity subject stroke live long-term care facility ( LTC ) .The null hypothesis would telerehabilitation balance train significantly different conventional balance training subject subacute stroke . study 3 : To investigate whether four-week tele-rehabilitation program result significant improvement physical function quality life subject chronic stroke live long-term care facility . Study 4 : To compare effect home-based telerehabilitation ( Tele ) intelligent agent system conventional in-home physical therapy ( home PT ) subject stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study 1 : Methods—Twenty-four subject substroke ( less 6 month post-stroke ) recruit telerehabilitation group conventional balance training group . Study 2 . Methods—Twenty -four participant mild moderate stroke randomize telerehabilitation ( Tele ) group conventional ( Conv ) group . They receive balance training three session per week 4 week . The pressure distribution buttock-pressure interface measure Pressure Distribution Plate ( PDM-S ) . Study 3.Methods : Twenty-four participant recruit three long-term care facility . Participants assign tele-rehabilitation ( Tele group ) conventional Groups ( Con group ) randomly . Baseline post-treatment physical function , daily activity health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) assess Simplified-STREAM , Berge Balance scale ( BBS ) , Barthel index ( BI ) , Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS 3.0 ) , respectively . Interventions conduct group two different physical therapist three session week four week intervention . Study 4 . Ten participant stroke randomized Tele control group 1 ( CG1 ) randomize control trial . The Tele group also receive home PT 3 week later control group 2 ( CG2 ) cross design . Intervention : All three group receive 4 week training ( 2 sessions/week , 50 minutes/session ) , include upper extremity balance exercise . Main outcome measure : The assessment perform baseline ( pre ) , 4 week ( post ) 7 week ( follow-up ) . The measure physical function include Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment ( STREAM ) , Postural Assessment Scale Stroke Patients ( PASS ) , Barthel index ( BI ) . The measure satisfaction include Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) user-satisfaction questionnaire .</detailed_description>
