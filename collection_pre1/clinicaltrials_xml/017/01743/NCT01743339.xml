	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , occur least 15-20 % individual expose traumatic event , chronic condition associate development multitude negative physical mental health consequence co-occurrence Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Sleep disturbance , especially nightmares insomnia , quite common patient PTSD , standard treatment PTSD directly focus sleep problem . Perhaps result , sleep disturbance one common residual symptom follow PTSD treatment depression treatment . Importantly , insomnia , depression PTSD characterize similar biological dysregulation , include alteration important aspect sleep ( rapid eye movement sleep slow wave sleep ) well process link health disease ( stress system responses inflammatory process ) . Directly treat sleep context PTSD MDD feasible lead robust improvement sleep , though whether improve sleep enhance PTSD MDD outcomes remain establish . This study enroll randomize 150 participant PTSD , MDD insomnia . Following baseline assessment ( T1 ) participant randomize receive cognitive-behavioral therapy insomnia ( CBTi ) , well-supported highly effective insomnia treatment , monitor control condition . Following first intervention period participant receive cognitive processing therapy , trauma focus therapy know effect PTSD depression . The study test whether CBTi may ( 1 ) achieve improvement PTSD MDD symptom severity ( 2 ) lead enhance response subsequent treatment cognitive processing therapy . Intervening CBTi prior PTSD-specific treatment measure biomarkers longitudinally , allow test specific effect sleep improvement PTSD , depressive symptom , objective aspect sleep stress inflammatory marker , thereby advance basic understanding biobehavioral mechanism PTSD depression . Importantly , propose approach utilizes treatment sequence may appeal trauma survivor post-traumatic event symptom may resistant unprepared fully engage standard PTSD treatment . Confirmation study hypothesis could support immediate translation finding clinical practice .</detailed_description>
