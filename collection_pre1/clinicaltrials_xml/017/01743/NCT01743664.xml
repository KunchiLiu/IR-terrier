	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) associate many psychological symptom . One relevant experience distress related disease , lead development Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . As far know study efficacy psychological treatment MS spite relevance patient ' quality life . Primary aim evaluate efficacy treatment Eyes Movement Desensitization Reprocessing ( EMDR ) PTSD secondary MS. EMDR elective treatment ( together Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ) PTSD accord international guideline . The secondary aim evaluate efficacy EMDR PTSD-associated symptom anxiety depression Quality Life . The study design randomize clinical trial . Sixty patient MS PTSD pre-screened use IES-R Clinician Administered PTSD Scale . The patient randomize two group ( 30 experimental group 30 control group ) .The psychological assessment perform group time tool : baseline ( T0 ) , treatment ( T1 ) 6 month later ( T2 ) two trained clinical psychologist ( independent blind treatment ) CAPS administration self report : Trauma Antecedent Questionnaire , Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale Functional Assessment Multiple Sclerosis . The experimental group undergo 10 weekly session 60 minute EMDR follow Shapiro 's protocol traumatic event . The efficacy evaluate compare result T0 , T1 T2 compare score experimental control group . Primary outcome measure : 1 ) proportion participant T1 T2 longer meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM IV-TR ) diagnostic criterion PTSD ; 2 ) reduction CAPS score four PTSD dimension pre-treatment post-treatment evaluation follow-up ( avoidance , reexperiencing traumatic event , hyperarousal numb ) . Secondary outcome measure : comparison score CMDI , HADS FAMS two group T0 , T1 T2 .

	<brief_title>The Efficacy EMDR Patients With PTSD Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) chronic neurological disease Central Nervous System ( CNS ) affect brain spinal cord destroy myelin sheath protects nerve fiber , leave plaque scar damage site . MS show wide range psychological psychological-related symptom , include psychiatric aspect , fatigue cognitive deficit . In particular , strong evidence psychiatric disorder associate MS , common depression , adjustment disorder anxiety . These occur frequently time diagnosis communication , early phase development disease relapse episode . Some study report significant association stressful life-events relapse , case point frequency number stressor enhance factor predict relapse episode . The patient may experience distress association external stressor , also relation onset progression disease . Diagnosis , relapse episode worsen physical functioning may perceive traumatic event may give rise physiological emotional posttraumatic symptom , case , Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . According DSM IV-TR , PTSD clinical condition characterise `` development characteristic symptom follow exposure extreme traumatic stressor involve direct personal experience event involve actual threaten death serious injury threat physical integrity . The person 's response event must involve intense fear , helplessness . The characteristic symptom result exposure extreme trauma include persistent re-experiencing traumatic event , persistent avoidance stimulus associate trauma numb general responsiveness persistent symptom increase arousal . The full symptom picture must present one month disturbance must cause clinically significant distress impairment social , occupational important area function '' [ DSM IV ] . Many psychological treatment available PTSD , range individual therapy family therapy support group together interpersonal , relational psychodynamic psychotherapy ; focus desensitise trauma memory meaning trauma well power affect relationship . Among therapy , two elective treatment accord international guideline Trauma-focused Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy ( CBT-TF ) Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing ( EMDR ) . CBT-TF focus thought beliefs help people overcome fear painful memory talk trauma repeatedly imagine situation realistically safe although still frighten . EMDR base accelerated information processing model integrate element different psychotherapy apply eight-phase approach . In EMDR , patient induce focus his/her negative thought , image body sensation receive `` alternate stimulus '' ( eye movement , hand tap sound ) . This procedure lead desensitisation emotional reprocessing . The aim study aim evaluate whether treatment base EMDR protocol resolve PTSD reduce PTS symptom , also improve PTS-associated symptom , anxiety depression . Primary objective : evaluate efficacy treatment EMDR PTSD MS . Secondary objective : To evaluate whether treatment EMDR improvement PTS-associated symptom anxiety depression improvement quality life . The recruitment patient proceed two-step screening : 1 ) Impact Event Scale Revised ( IES-R ) administer consecutive patient correspond neurological inclusion exclusion criterion , specify instruction consider illness traumatic event . 2 ) Patients score cut 33 assess SCID order confirm diagnosis PTSD . The research protocol propose patient PTSD meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , explanation aim study , relevance MS patient possibility may include , random assignment , treatment control group period study , time assessment tool . If agree , sign inform consent . Patients randomise intervention ( A ) control ( B ) group use block-wise randomisation sequence ( block size 10 ) . Assessment Measures : All patient evaluate neurologist Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) . The psychological assessment patient enter study perform T0 ( baseline evaluation ) , T1 ( post-treatment evaluation 12 week ) T2 ( follow evaluation six month later ) determine reliability result . Measures : - CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED PTSD SCALE ( CAPS ) : CAPS clinical semi-structured interview base DSM IV-TR , gold standard ass PTSD . It 30-item structured interview meet DSM IV criterion PTSD . It assess 4 dimension PTSD : avoidance , reexperiencing traumatic event , hyperarousal numbing . Dissociative symptom measure three CAPS dissociation item ( depersonalization , derealization , reduction awareness one 's surroundings ) . It use make current ( past month ) life-time diagnosis PTSD ass symptom past week . - TRAUMA ANTECEDENT QUESTIONNAIRE ( TAQ ) : interview base questionnaire ass trauma load due previous trauma . The TAQ ask frequency ( never , rarely , commonly ) experience assign 11 domain ( range positive experience like competence safety , negative experience neglect , physical , emotional , sexual abuse , witness trauma ) , separately assess four developmental period include early childhood ( 0-6 ) , middle childhood , ( 7-12 ) , adolescence ( 13 18 ) , adult ( 19+ ) . - CHICAGO MULTISCALE DEPRESSION INVENTORY ( CMDI ) : CMDI 42-item , self-reporting questionnaire develop assess depression MS chronic disease . It three subscales design use either separately combination . The mood subscale provide conservative indication depression total CMDI score depression tool . - HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE ( HADS ) : HADS develop identify caseness ( possible probable ) anxiety disorder depression among patient non-psychiatric hospital clinic . It divide Anxiety subscale ( HADS-A ) Depression subscale ( HADS-D ) contain seven intermingled item . The tool long used study involve patient MS. - FAMS : Quality life . The FAMS factorially derive self-report scale design ass six primary aspect QOL patient MS : Mobility , Symptoms , Emotional Well-Being , General Contentment Thinking Fatigue , Family/Social Well- Being . Treatment : The experimental group undergo 10 session 60 minute treatment EMDR protocol . The EMDR treatment conduct 3 expert psychotherapist 6 year experience liaison set , possession II level training degree EMDR . Relaxation technique ( RT ) perform three psychotherapist work facility . Treatments independent blind clinical psychologist conduct clinical assessment . The EMDR protocol follow procedure phase describe Shapiro ( 1996 ) . This complex treatment incorporate many different intervention order recall trauma-related memory subdue . EMDR processing consist attend oscillatory stimulation present visual , auditory tactile modality , move finger side side across patient 's visual field present alternate tap hand alternatively . Eye movement commonly use external stimulus , patient problem kind stimulation , headache sensomotor deficit , therapist chooses tap alternative form oscillatory stimulation equivalent therapeutic efficacy . Relaxation session follow structure EMDR session , include diaphragmatic breathing , progressive muscle relaxation , visualisation , cue-controlled relaxation , rapid relaxation . The efficacy EMDR treatment evaluate compare result tool ( CAPS , CMDI , HADS , FAMS ) administer treat group T0 , T1 T2 compare score experimental group control group . Primary outcome measure include 1 ) Proportion participant T1 T2 longer meet DSM IV-TR diagnostic criterion PTSD ( SCID ) among patient experimental group comparison control group ; 2 ) reduction CAPS score four PTSD dimension pre-treatment follow-up group ( avoidance , re-experiencing traumatic event , hyperarousal numb ) . 3 ) Reduction IES score . Scores anxiety , depression quality life include secondary outcome . Dissociative symptom evaluate three CAPS dissociation item ( Taylor et al. , 2003 ) . Additional expect result : large number patient assess post traumatic symptom might improve knowledge prevalence also trauma underlying MS . Even primary aim study , assessment trauma load interview-based TAQ lead life-trauma evaluation may study correlation onset disease emotional correlate . Moreover , EMDR , associate trauma define treat : give session video-recorded , analysis ( beyond three session review treatment fidelity ) may add knowledge role trauma load MS .</detailed_description>
