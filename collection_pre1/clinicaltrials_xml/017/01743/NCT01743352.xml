	<brief_title>Comparison Ultrafast Echo With Echotracking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrafast ECHO new non invasive method assess stiffness living tissue . It take advantage fast image technology ( 20 000 images/sec ) measure diffusion pressure wave tissue . This pressure wave either natural ( blood pressure ) , generate short ultrasonic impulsion give place . By use mode , possible precise cartography tissue mechanical property . This technique apply solid tissue breast liver , yet currently hollow tissue artery . The aim present study compare value stiffness obtain Ultrafast ECHO reference non invasive technique , Echotracking , measure stiffness assess deformation artery response change blood pressure . On physiological part , revisit old concept increase stiffness hypertensive 's artery . Indeed , hypertension associate increased stiffness due recruitement collagen fiber , also chronic remodelling . We show remodelling conduct accumulation arterial tissue lesser intrinsic stiffness . The latter find do model base echotracking measurement . It interest see whether hold true stiffness directly measure . Sixty subject ( 30 normotensive and30 hypertensive ) include study . Measurement perform random order 3 time common carotid artery side . Aortic stiffness measure pulse wave velocity</detailed_description>
