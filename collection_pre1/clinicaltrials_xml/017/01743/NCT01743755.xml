	<brief_title>Santeon-CAP ; Dexamethasone Community-acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) common infection . Approximately 20 percent episode pneumonia result hospitalization . It lead cause community-acquired infection require intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission . In pulmonary infection , release cytokine inflammatory mediator alveolar macrophage serve mechanism invade pathogen eliminate . However , reaction innate immune system potentially harmful excessive release circulate inflammatory cytokine cause damage patient , particularly lung . Interest role corticosteroid pathophysiology critical illness exist since early part 20th century . On ICU , early treatment corticosteroid attenuate systemic inflammation widespread . At time , outside ICU little evidence available effect treatment corticosteroid patient diagnosed CAP . Theoretically , early initiate administration corticosteroid course CAP low systemic pulmonary inflammation . This may lead early resolution pneumonia reduction complication ( sepsis , mortality ) .</detailed_description>
