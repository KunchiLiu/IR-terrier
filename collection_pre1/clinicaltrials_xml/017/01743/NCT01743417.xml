	<brief_title>Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation Children After Severe Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Our Fogarty `` Brain Disorders '' R21 study finding demonstrate attention work memory deficit persist one four child cerebral malaria ( CM ) ( Boivin et al. , 2007 ; John , Bangirana et al. , 2008 ) . Uganda one high incidence malaria worldwide ( ~480/1000 ) 10 % incident become severe 90 % case occur child ( Snow , Guerra , Noor , Myint , &amp; Hay , 2005 ) . This result estimate 80 thousand new case year Ugandan child mild severe neurocognitive impairment disease . Such impairment likely compromise school performance , impede activity daily live , lessen future economic opportunity . There know treatment intervention acute illness prevent CM brain-injury effect ( Abubakar et al. , 2007 ) . Nor neurocognitive rehabilitative treatment program available low-resource setting affect child . However , successfully pilot computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy ( CCRT ) intervention specifically improve attention , visual-spatial learning , psychosocial adjustment ( domains show affected CM previous study ) school-age Ugandan CM survivor ( Bangirana , Giordani et al. , 2009 ) . This evidence justify R01 study . The present application propose randomize control trial ( RCT ) establish CCRT improve attention , work memory , aspect executive functioning , psychosocial adjustment pediatric CM survivor . Such program already use extensively child developmental disability ( e.g. , Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , learn disorder ) brain injury high-income country . The evidence RCT study intervention strong enough warrant evaluation CCRT at-risk African child ( Bangirana , Idro , John , &amp; Boivin , 2006 ; Boivin &amp; Giordani , 2009 ) . CCRT could also extend variety infectious disease cause brain injury persist neurocognitive deficit child set ( e.g. , HIV , schistosomiasis , meningitis , encephalitis , neurocysticercosis ) . Objectives : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness CCRT improve neuropsychological performance psychiatric outcome Ugandan child survive severe malaria . 2 . To evaluate whether severity malaria illness ( e.g. , immunological brain inflammation , EEG abnormality ) predictive neuropsychological benefit CCRT . 3 . METHODS Study design : Randomized control trial Study Population : Our propose study group child age 5 12 year consist 150 child severe malaria ( either cerebral malaria severe malaria anemia ) . From home severe malaria child , also recruit 1 sibling ( neighbor child ) 5 12 year age without history cerebral malaria know infectious disease could cause brain injury ( Community Controls Home : CC child N = 150 ) .</detailed_description>
