	<brief_summary>A double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-finding study investigate safety efficacy Lybridos domestic set healthy female subject hypoactive sexual desire disorder maladaptive activity sexual inhibitory mechanism . In present study , efficacy Lybridos evaluate domestic setting healthy female subject HSDD maladaptive activity sexual inhibitory mechanism ( ) . Sexual satisfaction aspect sexual functioning measure within 24 hour sexual activity . The following hypothesis test : Lybridos , compare placebo , significantly increase number satisfy sexual event . The number satisfy sexual event differ significantly subject treat placebo subject treat 0.5 mg testosterone alone and/or 10 mg buspirone alone . Lybridos , compare placebo , significantly increase sexual desire/arousal . Sexual desire/arousal differ significantly subject treat placebo subject treat 0.5 mg testosterone alone and/or 10 mg buspirone alone . Lybridos , compare testosterone alone buspirone alone , significantly increase number satisfy sexual event sexual desire/arousal .</brief_summary>
