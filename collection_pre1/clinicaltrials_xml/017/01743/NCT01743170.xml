	<brief_summary>The proportion hypertensive patient achieve adequate blood pressure control meeting guideline target remain low . Of hypertensive patient , 50 % antihypertensive medication . Of blood pressure lower drug , 50 % blood pressure control . The objective study : 1 . To test feasibility telemonitoring blood pressure Flemish general practice . 2 . To investigate randomized fashion whether telemonitoring enable self-measurement blood pressure lead faster blood pressure control self-measurement without telemonitoring information . 3 . The secondary endpoint include various blood pressure index , adverse effect , simple assessment quality life , adherence , log technical problem , cost effectiveness ( EQ-5D-5L ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect estimate 20 % 30 % world 's adult population . Despite availability numerous safe effective pharmacologic therapy , include single-pill combination 2-3 drug , percentage patient achieve adequate blood pressure control meeting guideline target remain low . The rule half still applies . Of hypertensive patient , 50 % antihypertensive medication . Of blood pressure lower drug , 50 % blood pressure control . Achieving target blood pressure level treatment hypertension require patient take medication properly ( adherence ) , also continue throughout long-term treatment ( persistence ) . Poor medication-taking behavior major problem among patient hypertension , one main cause failure achieve blood pressure control . Self-measurement blood pressure home improve adherence treatment control blood pressure . One might even hypothesize telemonitoring blood pressure , allow instantaneous feedback doctor patient might even effective usual self-measurement improve adherence reach treatment tool . Previous study demonstrate feasibility telemonitoring blood pressure . However , several issue remain unaddressed . - Feasibility telemonitoring within Belgian context never test . No attempt ever make Belgium assess adherence antihypertensive drug primary care . - Telemonitoring blood pressure never make routine clinical practice unless proven application technique result faster well blood pressure control compare usual care include self-measurement blood pressure home . - Secondary endpoint must also include adverse event , simple assessment quality life , adherence , log technical problem , cost-effectiveness . LAPTOHP randomize parallel-group study , address feasibility potential benefit telemonitoring blood pressure home . Eligible patient recruit seven general practice . LAPTOHP include three stage - Screening period follow stratification randomization : Screening involves check inclusion exclusion criterion , rule secondary hypertension remediable specific treatment , obtain inform write consent outline Helsinki declaration . Eligible patient stratify centre randomize one-to-three proportion control intervention . Randomization implement sequentially number sealed envelope , contain group assignment . These envelope available practice , contact Studies Coordinating Centre ( SCC ) necessary randomize patient . - Randomised period : Investigators optimize medical treatment rotate patient different class antihypertensive drug , combine drug class accord current guideline European Societies Cardiology Hypertension ( ESC/ESH ) , achieve maximal tolerate dose drug . In intervention group , investigator receive report telemonitoring data weekly interval ; control group doctor receive information self-measured blood pressure record home week precede office visit via diary card . Doctors free schedule contact patient office visit discretion indicate clinical context . Once blood pressure control achieve , blood pressure measure device ( telemonitoring enable ) recuperate become available next patient . In control group , patient keep diary card week precede office visit . In control group , doctor receive full report telemonitoring data completion randomize treatment , patient achieve blood pressure control . - Late follow-up : Three month achieve blood pressure control , patient telemonitored 1 week complete diary card , precede office visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women men eligible . Women reproductive age apply effective contraception . Age range 20 year ( inclusive ) less 80 year . Patients hypertension , uncontrolled medical treatment . At screen visit , patient either untreated least 4 week take stable drug regimen least 4 week . Medical treatment consist major drug class . This include diuretic , βblockers , αblockers , calciumchannel blocker ( CCBs ) , inhibitor rennin system ( angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) , angiotensin II type1 receptor blocker ( ARBs ) , direct renin inhibitor aliskiren , aldosterone receptor antagonist ( ARAs ) centrally act antihypertensive drug vasodilator ( hydralazine ) . In line current recommendation recent study , unless contraindicate tolerated , aldosterone antagonist , spironolactone 25 50 mg per day attempt least 4 week improve blood pressure control treatmentresistant patient . The patient intellectually emotionally capable measure blood pressure home accept keep diary ( control group ) report send doctor ( intervention group ) . Patient provide write informed consent . The clinical context suboptimal telemonitoring blood pressure : Myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris , cerebrovascular accident within 6 month screen period . Type1 diabetes mellitus require multiple adjustment treatment maintain control diabetes mellitus recent hyperglycemic hypoglycemic coma . Renal dysfunction define estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 30 mL/min/1.73m² , use Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) formula . Secondary hypertension , treatment option antihypertensive drug treatment indicate . Sleep apnea syndrome qualifies treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . Atrial fibrillation arrhythmia make oscillometric blood pressure measurement unreliable . The patient wait list elective surgery cardiovascular intervention . Patients alcohol substance abuse psychiatric illness . The patient serious medical condition , opinion investigator , may adversely interfere selfmeasurement blood pressure home . Patients participate trial investigational drug device .</criteria>
