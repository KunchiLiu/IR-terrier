	<brief_title>Cost/Utility Ratio Management Patients With Acquired Severe Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Materials method Study design This study organizational assessment integrate system care ( GIR ) patient SBI design prospective , randomised trial . An individual record create patient SBI ; record contain patient 's personal data , information prior admission intensive care neurosurgery , clinical characteristic , presence device , complication , time hospitalisation Intensive Care Unit , cognitive condition . Once determine study entry criterion meet , patient enter register prospectively parallel-group randomised two different management strategy . The concealment allocation guarantee availability bed ward . Patients health care provider assessor blind study design compare strategy management . Data analyst blind treatment . Sample size The sample size requirement study intend provide adequate power analysis primary objective ( decrease event-related mortality ) . The simulation run statsoft six sigma software accord follow hypothesis : mortality severe brain injury use Null hypothesis 58 % . This percent value expect decrease 40 % study arm . The target type-I error ( Î± ) 0.05 . A sample size 119 patient per group would allow power 80 % detect individual risk score ratio 0.70 type -I error 0.05 . Based availability bed ward , two group form : ( ) UC patient , meet criterion access Graded Intensity Rehabilitation Unit patient SBI ( SBI-GIRU ) , enter department bed free , therefore , discharge Intensive Care Unit management model available , acute care , Intensive Brain Injury rehabilitation ( cod 75 ) brain injury rehabilitation ( code 56 ) ( hospital admission , lasting average 60 day , intensive rehabilitation care deliver prior transfer another structure ) , long-term care , home . ( ii ) The GIR patient meet criteria access SBI-GIRU bed available Unit , individualise programme intensive rehabilitation care structure . The primary outcome assess effectiveness two different form management mortality ; secondary outcome include improvement quality life evaluate use classification system base Health Utilities Index Mark 2 ( 8 ) number day hospitalisation . Patients Patients acquire SBI refer unit January 2007 January 2010 consider study . The diagnosis acquire SBI make basis clinical history , physical examination , clinical symptom , Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt; 8 neuro-radiological investigation . After entered register , patient UC group begin monitor phase , patient GIR group submit clinical evaluation , prognostic stratification , clinical instrumental investigation , individualise rehabilitation plan make , characterize structure multidisciplinary intervention periodically review . The alternative management strategy describe great detail . Usual care In case patient manage accord organization management model take care patient . The organization model characterize one two professional figure ( physiatrists , neurologist ) , hierarchical relationship , space limit specific pathology ; access determine clinical stability ; instrument governance guideline consensus rehabilitation programme focus functional cognitive area ; medical care process govern hierarchy . The technology model limit specific specialty . Graded intensive rehabilitation This result-oriented management model ; multidisciplinary purpose determine appropriateness hospitalization patient ' need use ranking ; management `` disease-based '' , instrument governance diagnostic-therapeutic rehabilitation pathway ( DTRP ) , quality system product standard ; medical care process separate strand result-oriented autonomy ; technology present model identify basis health need support vital sign . Classifying patient In relation clinical condition complexity care need , three profile patient SBI identify : critically patient , complex patient frail patient . The critically ill patient patient abnormal vital parameter require constant monitoring may need immediate therapeutic intervention . The complex patient individual significant comorbidities require complicate , expensive often invasive diagnostic investigation and/or numerous therapy sometimes conflict strong risk interaction . The complexity care increase `` frail patient '' . Frail patient : ( ) mark susceptibility develop acute illness manifest atypical clinical picture ; ( ii ) rapid fluctuation health , even day , strong tendency develop complication ( failure cascade ) ; ( iii ) high risk adverse event iatrogenic event ; ( iv ) slow , almost always , partial recovery ; ( v ) continue requirement medical intervention , need ongoing assistance ; ( vi ) high risk mortality . Levels intensity care On basis above-described evaluation , patient assign appropriate following setting . Level 1 ( intensive ) : patient critical unstable , dependent potentially dependent technological aid high risk complication . Area competence - red : monitor bed , single room , infusion pump , telemetry , daily medical round , intensive nursing activity 24 hour day . Level 2 ( medium ) : patient clinically unstable require constant monitoring vital parameter . Highly complex medical activity intensive nursing care prevalent . Area competence - yellow : room two bed , infusion pump , telemetry , daily medical round , intensive , structured nursing activity , physiotherapy speech therapy . Level 3 ( low ) : patient clinically stable require constant monitoring vital sign continuous presence doctor . Activities prevalently physiotherapy nurse care . Area competence - green . Level 4 ( minimum ) : patient clinically stable require social nursing care discharge . Area competence - white . The transition different level determine clinical criterion define area competence require . Staff The staff SBI-GIRU consist neurologist , internist , physiatrist , cardiologist , speech physician , twelve nurse specific skill , chief nurse , nutritionist , two speech therapist , three physiotherapist , psychologist social worker . The aim multidisciplinary approach facilitate recovery disability cause SBI . Each member team duty control , analyse redesign organization support activity process set individual rehabilitation plan . Three type intervention - medical , nursing physiotherapeutic - identify rehabilitation plan strongly integrated order achieve rehabilitation objective . The healthcare rehabilitation process found guideline criterion evidence-based medicine . The rehabilitation process The treatment plan discuss collaboration whole multidisciplinary team . An individual rehabilitation plan draw outline : ( ) appropriateness access ; ( ii ) type access ( SBI traumatic , anoxic one , ischaemic haemorrhagic nature ) ; ( iii ) objectives rehabilitation process ( prognostic stratification , therapy optimization , prevention secondary injury , management device , management cognitive impairment , prevention damage immobility , recovery motor function ) ; ( iv ) use instrument implement plan ( multi-disciplinary meeting , electroencephalogram , physiotherapy briefing , diagnostic radiology , consultancy , monitor system , infusion system ) ; ( v ) time-course plan ; ( vi ) result indicator short medium term ; ( vii ) result indicator long-term ; ( viii ) method discharge ; ( ix ) management counsel . Follow-up A monitoring form use patient record follow information : personal data , outcome measure , employment issue , degree socialisation , commitment caregiver result Health Utilities Index Mark 2 questionnaire . Outcomes Three type outcomes consider : management outcome , functional result hard end-point ( survival ) . Management outcomes . The management outcomes consider : access time , number structure involve management patient , healthcare path , number day spend hospital , type management patient subsequently address . Functional result . These include number device discharge , Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS ) score , Barthel Index score change quality life , assess use classification system base Health Utilities Index Mark 2 Survival . The patient 's death relate event index consider hard event . In survival analysis two management model consider predictor mortality . These predictor adjust confound variable ( age , sex , aetiology , GOS score , Level Cognitive Functioning score index organ function ) . The association independent predictor outcome assessed compare follow-up data Cox proportional hazard regression model . The end-point study event-related mortality . The distribution time function event analyse Kaplan-Meier method Cost analysis The cost/utility analysis perform payer 's prospective ( health authority ) . Hospital admission implementation process health care - particular , admission intensive care , acute care , rehabilitation social welfare sector - consider . Management cost incur home exclude . The price use calculation average daily cost hospitalisation per type management list Interregional Tariff Agreement [ Tariffa Unica Convenzionale , TUC ] 2009 hospital healthcare service . The QALY determine calculate year life gain management model adjust quality life . The difference QALYs two model obtain consider average increase life derive survival curve ( difference area survival curve ) adjust quality life . Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis perform calculate cost/utility ratio use extreme ; particular , change QALY cost evaluate consider extreme ( confidence limit variation mean ) . Statistical analysis To compare clinical functional parameter two group use one-way analysis variance continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . For analysis prognostic indicator , two management strategy consider independent predictor outcome . The analysis adjust confound factor . event-related mortality consider end-point study . The association independent predictor outcome assessed compare follow-up data Cox proportional hazard regression model . The assumption proportionality risk observation time , evaluate use analysis residue Schoenfeld . Deaths cause unrelated SBI treat censored observation . The distribution time function event analyse use method Kaplan-Meier . The prognostic information present relative risk 95 % confidence limit . Descriptive statistic express mean value Â± standard deviation . Probability value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
