	<brief_title>WBV Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Ankle sprain often result ankle instability , likely cause damage passive neurological structure . Whole body vibration ( WBV ) neuromuscular training method improve neurologic parameter impair . The aim study compare current gold standard functional treatment functional treatment plus WBV patient acute unilateral unstable inversion ankle sprain . Methods/Design : 60 patient , age 18-40 year , present isolate , unilateral , acute unstable inversion ankle sprain include bicentric , biphasic , randomize control trial . Patients randomize envelope drawing . All patient allow early mobilization pain-depending weight bearing , limited functional immobilization orthesis , PRICE , NSARDs well home supervise physiotherapy . Supervised physical therapy take place twice week , 30 minute per session , 6 week , follow standardize intervention protocol . During supervised physical therapy , intervention group perform similar exercise side-alternating sinusoidal vibration platform control group . Two time dependent primary outcome parameter assess . Short-term outcome six week postural control quantify sway index . Mid-term outcome one year assess subjective instability , define presence giving-way attack . Secondary outcome parameter include return pre-injury level activity , residual pain , recurrence , objective instability , energy / coordination , Foot Ankle Disability Index EQ 5D .</detailed_description>
