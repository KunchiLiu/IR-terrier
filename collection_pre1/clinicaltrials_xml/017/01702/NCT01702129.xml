	<brief_summary>Background : Site-specific delivery anti-cancer therapeutic paramount reduce nonspecific toxicity increase efficacy chemotherapeutic agent . Due small molecular size nonspecific mechanisms action , conventional chemotherapy result significant toxicity limit effectiveness treatment reduce overall quality life cancer patient . Encapsulation toxic agent inside lipid-based carrier system ( so-called liposome ) result passive target compound solid tumor . The preferential delivery liposomal drug solid tumor mostly due alter barrier-properties tumor-associated vessel . This result improve delivery time significantly milder toxicity profile . Recently , specificity delivery increase attach monoclonal antibody antibody fragment surface liposome ( =immunoliposomes , antibody-linked nanoparticles ) . Antibody-coated immunoliposomes attach selectively antigen express target cell internalize efficiently . Furthermore , evidence drug resistance , major challenge cancer treatment , may overcome delivery system . A logical accessible target , EGFR , overexpressed variety primary human cancer cell involve signal pathway contribute tumor initiation tumor progression . Recently , investigator test immunoliposomes epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) preclinical setting . Based preclinical result initiate phase I clinical trial . Study hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes selectively deliver cytotoxic compound EGFR-overexpressing tumor cell . Specific delivery suppose increase efficacy reduce side-effects compound . The primary objective phase 1 trial determination maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) future phase 2 trial nanoparticle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>C225-ILS-DOX This phase 1 trial anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes , investigative nanoparticle target EGFR-overexpressing tumor cell . The investigator construct anti-EGFR immunoliposomes use Fab ' fragment chimeric MAb cetuximab ( C225 , cetuximab , erbitux™ , ImClone Systems Corp. , NY , USA ; Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) , covalently conjugate liposome membrane . This approach design provide maximal drug delivery cancer cell via receptor-targeted internalizing drug carrier stable , non-immunogenic , long-lived extend blood tissue residence time capable deliver large payload diverse type drug . Based extensive preclinical study , investigator decide perform first-in-human clinical trial patient EGFR-overexpressing solid tumor already receive available standard treatment . The therapeutic compound test trial C225-ILs-dox , doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR-immunoliposome . Doxorubicin one active agent many human tumor , high percentage malignancy express EGFR . Therefore , target doxorubicin EGFR-expressing tumor via EGFR-specific antibody C225 enhance specificity efficacy chemotherapy , encapsulation cytotoxic drug within pegylated liposome time decrease toxicity . This single center , open study . The aim trial definition maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) future phase 2 study . Secondary endpoint include overall response rate , time-to-progression assessment pharmakokinetic compound . The trial follow canonical 3+3 design allow additional recruitment 6 patient dose level define MTD . Planned dose level follow : Level 1 = 5 mg/m2 Level 2 = 10 mg/m2 Level 3 = 20 mg/m2 Level 4 = 30 mg/m2 Level 5 = 40 mg/m2 Level 6 = 50 mg/m2 Level 7 = 60 mg/m2 Level 8 = 70 mg/m2 Level 9 = 80 mg/m2 At dose level , 3 patient may enrol simultaneously . Escalation next high dose allow patient 3 give dose level receive least one full cycle therapy dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) occur give dose level . The decision enter next dose level make study team review available toxicity data previous group . A DLT define grade 4 toxicity , grade 3 toxicity last one week or/and febrile neutropenia grade 3 ( define neutrophils &lt; 1.0 x 10e9/l fever &gt; 38.5 °C ) . Nausea , vomit , anorexia , alopecia ( grade 2 ) exclude dose limit toxicity . Similarly , adverse event clearly relate primary tumor , progression disease consider DLTs . In addition , preexist toxicity must take account define analyze DLTs . Patients treated disease progression maximum 6 cycle . Patients complete treatment phase ( 24 week ) show complete partial response well stable disease enter observation phase study . This phase end 12 month last patient include . At time treatment phase observation phase , patient sign disease progression accord RECIST criterion report result cancer treatment discontinue treatment due unacceptable toxicity go study treat investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>
