	<brief_summary>To evaluate functional , clinical , subjective parameter patient rotator cuff syndrome bursitis treat Traumeel® S injection versus corticosteroid injection versus placebo . 160 patient plan randomise ( i.e. , 64 patient per active treatment group 32 patient placebo group ) 9 investigator site Germany , Belgium Spain . Finally 176 patient randomize ( 73 Traumeel , 67 Fortecortin 36 Placebo ) 175 receive least one dosage treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRARO ( Traumeel® S Rotator Cuff Syndrome ) -Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duration study 16 week . Duration Treatments 15 day , apply one injection 2 ml od study medication day 1 , 8 , 15 . There follow visit day 22 ( Primary endpoint ) , telephone visit week 9 final visit week 15 . Standard descriptive summary statistic calculate continuous variable ( i.e . arithmetic mean , standard deviation , minimum value , median , maximum value , number non-missing value ) . All statistical analysis study exploratory nature . The summary efficacy parameter , statistical analysis primary efficacy variable , statistical analysis secondary efficacy variable perform PP Set . These summary analysis support correspond summary exploratory statistical analysis perform Full Analysis Set . Missing value efficacy parameter impute last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) approach . The Modified Per-Protocol ( MPP ) Set exclude PP Set also patient take unallowed concomitant medication Visit 5 use secondary population analysis efficacy . All statistical test two-sided significance level ( alpha ) = 0.05 , unless specify otherwise . The primary efficacy variable change baseline VAS abduction rotation pain Visit 5 ( Day 22 ) ( Traumeel® S injection versus corticoid injection ) active external rotation . A one-sided test non-inferiority Traumeel® S respect dexamethasone level 0.025 compute use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) model treatment group qualitative factor baseline value abduction rotation pain VAS active external rotation covariate . The test decision base one-sided 97.5 % confidence interval correspond treatment difference . The non-inferiority margin set 13 mm 0 - 100 mm VAS scale .</detailed_description>
