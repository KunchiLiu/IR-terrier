	<brief_summary>Current standard prophylactic immunosuppression renal transplantation include tacrolimus , calcineurin inhibitor , dose twice daily . In Canada , oral tacrolimus available twice daily formulation market Prograf® since 1997 . It recently become available extended release formulation call Advagraf® , dose daily . Advagraf® demonstrate therapeutically equivalent Prograf® renal transplant maintenance population , result approve alternative twice daily formulation patient . There evolve expand positive clinical experience Advagraf® kidney transplantation show preferred many patient , due diminish dosing frequency . In clinical trial , Advagraf® show potential benefit Prograf® less inter intra-patient variability , improve cardiovascular profile , improve kidney function . Compared Prograf® , Advagraf® also low Cmin 'trough ' concentration well low Cmax 'peak ' concentration . The purpose study convert stabilize renal transplant patient currently receive Prograf® Advagraf® , investigate potential therapeutic benefit . The Framingham Risk Score Reynold 's Risk Score currently recommend Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) predict 10-year cardiovascular risk general population . Surrogate marker widely use clinical trial shorten follow-up duration . In study , investigator use Framingham Risk Score Reynold 's Risk Score quantify change estimate cardiovascular risk . The investigator also intend examine novel inflammatory marker investigate cardiovascular risk . The investigator hypothesize consistent drug exposure lower Cmax note Advagraf® decrease Framingham Risk Score , Reynolds Risk score well marker inflammation kidney transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
