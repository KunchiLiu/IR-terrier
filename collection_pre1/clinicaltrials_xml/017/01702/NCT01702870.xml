	<detailed_description>Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy heterogeneous group condition characterise skeletal muscle inflammation lead proximal muscle weakness , often tenderness , occasionally dermatological manifestation . Diagnosis clinical base Bohan Peter criteria comprise clinical examination , serological marker , electromyography ( EMG ) muscle biopsy . This relatively poor sensitivity specificity . Muscle biopsy particular false negative rate 10-15 % invasive . Clinical criterion also lack discriminatory power differentiate recurrent ( breakthrough ) myopathy myopathy secondary treatment corticosteroid . Magnetic resonance ( MR ) image advantage non-invasive , able discriminate different tissue , identify area inflammation . The aim study ass effectiveness MR sequence diagnosis myopathy , monitor treatment response , differentiate breakthrough myopathy steroid-induced myopathy .</detailed_description>
