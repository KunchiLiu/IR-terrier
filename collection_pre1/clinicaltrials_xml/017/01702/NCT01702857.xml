	<brief_summary>This first time human ( FTiH ) study design ass experimental TDENV-PIV vaccine predominantly dengue-primed adult population . The study design afford first time human ( FTiH ) safety immunogenicity assessment three TDENV-PIV vaccine candidate , formulate different adjuvant : either aluminum hydroxide , AS01E AS03B ( adjuvant use GSK Biologicals ' hepatitis B candidate vaccine , malaria candidate vaccine pandemic flu vaccine , respectively ) . Each vaccine candidate contain 1 µg purify virus antigen per four DENV type . Additionally , study evaluate alum adjuvanted TDENV-PIV vaccine candidate contain 4 µg purify virus antigen per four DENV type . The control group receive saline placebo . All experimental vaccination administer accord 2-dose schedule , 28 day apart . There parallel FTiH study conduct United States dengue-naive population use investigational vaccine .</brief_summary>
