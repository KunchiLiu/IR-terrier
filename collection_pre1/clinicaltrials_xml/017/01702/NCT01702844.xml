	<brief_title>Single Arm Tolerability Weekly Nab-paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized phase II study evaluate safety efficacy weekly nab-paclitaxel second-line treatment 42 elderly patient , 70 year age great non-small cell lung cancer ( NSLC ) . Patients require progressed single prior regimen . Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 administer intravenously , weekly 3 week every 4-week cycle . After every two cycle therapy , image perform assess response . Patients eligible continue receive therapy time disease progression . Primary Objectives To evaluate tolerability weekly nab-paclitaxel older adult advance lung cancer progress least 1 prior regimen 6 cycle 3 week discontinuation treatment , come treatment earlier . Secondary Objectives To estimate overall survival To estimate progression-free survival To estimate response rate Correlative Objectives To explore baseline component GA predictor chemotherapy tolerance overall survival To explore use p16 measurement elderly predictor chemotherapy tolerance overall survival To explore impact weekly nab-paclitaxel treatment quality life , measure LCSS FACT-L .</detailed_description>
