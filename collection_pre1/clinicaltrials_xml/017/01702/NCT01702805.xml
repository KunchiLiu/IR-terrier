	<detailed_description>Long-term outcome extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) preterm infant , weigh less equal 1000 g birth , poor pose major health care burden . Virtually infant transfuse , inconsistent hemoglobin ( Hgb ) threshold . The investigator propose TOP randomize infant less equal 1000 g BW &lt; 29 week GA receive red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion accord one two strategy Hgb threshold , either high Hgb ( liberal transfusion ) low Hgb ( restrictive transfusion ) algorithm . It currently unknown transfusion strategy superior . TOP power demonstrate strategy reduces primary outcome death neurodisability survivor 22-26 month . A secondary study entitle `` Effect Blood Transfusion Practices Cerebral Somatic Oximetry '' , also know NIRS study , determine difference cerebral oxygenation fractional tissue oxygen extraction NIRS high low hemoglobin threshold group red blood cell transfusion . The investigator also propose determine whether abnormal cerebral NIRS measure good predictor NDI hemoglobin alone whether abnormal mesenteric NIRS measure associate development NEC within 48 hour follow transfusion .</detailed_description>
