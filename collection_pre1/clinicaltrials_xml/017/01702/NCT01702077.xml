	<brief_summary>The aim study train patient tic disorder control activity region brain associate urge tic . Patients give direct feedback regard activity brain area undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanning , try learn control activity region feedback session . In separate session , patient give sham feedback base brain pattern prior subject rather brain pattern . Our primary hypothesis biofeedback training reduce tic symptom sham feedback .</brief_summary>
