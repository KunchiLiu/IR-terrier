	<brief_summary>Background : - Nicotine addiction often make difficult stop smoking . Researchers want understand area brain important nicotine addiction . They use type brain stimulation call repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) look part brain may involve nicotine addiction . They see area affect brain function , thinking , decision making . For study , rTMS first test nonsmoker , smoker recruit late time . Objectives : - To study area brain involve nicotine addiction . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age smoke . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also provide urine sample . - There four study session . The first session involve magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The three visit involve rTMS MRI scan . - The first MRI scan take baseline picture brain . Participants also practice task three session mock scanner . - At next three visit , participant rTMS MRI scan . Two visit involve rTMS ; visit involve mock rTMS actual magnetic stimulation . During MRI scan , participant perform task involve decision making .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To investigate neurocircuitry cognitive affective processing relevant nicotine addiction use repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) . Specifically , examine insula neurocircuitry use unilateral H-coil deliver rTMS Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( R DLPFC ) insula . We examine effect various stimulation parameter behavior well task base activation rest state functional connectivity ( rsFC ) fMRI scan . Study population : Up 60 healthy adult non-smokers enrol achieve 28 completers . Design : Within subject design subject complete 4 session : rTMS two different stimulation frequency 2 sham session . Outcome measure : Behavior decision make task task base rest state blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) activation neural circuit relevant nicotine addiction fMRI scanning .</detailed_description>
