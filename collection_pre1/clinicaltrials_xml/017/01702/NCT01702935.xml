	<brief_summary>Background : - Primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) condition affect ovary function . It mean ovary able function level appropriate woman 's age . Previously , think woman fix number egg lose month none leave menopause . However , recently , stem cell find ovary adult woman . These stem cell may able make new egg . Studying cell may help woman POI future . Researchers want collect ovarian tissue woman POI investigate ovarian stem cell . Objectives : - To collect ovarian tissue woman primary ovarian insufficiency . Eligibility : - Women 18 50 year age primary ovarian insufficiency . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also full gynecological exam . They provide blood urine sample . - Participants donate ovarian tissue study . It collect outpatient surgery . The surgery take either half ovary full ovary . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early loss human ovarian function result clinical condition know primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) premature ovarian failure ( POF ) . This devastating condition render woman unable genetic child 95 % case ( 1 ) , well failure hormonal production ovary critical maintain bone health , restful sleep , quality life . Indeed , carefully design study control group use , 1.5 % POI patient become pregnant ( 2-8 ) , may accurately represent true fertility rate population . Currently , fertility treatment patient primarily use egg donate young woman Until recently , think woman bear limited number egg , slowly deplete month exhaustion time menopause . However , recent study suggest new egg make adult stem cell ovary . ( 1 , 2 ) These ovarian stem cell could transplant recipient mouse , deliver donor derive offspring ( 3 ) . Recently , ovarian germline stem cell ( i.e. , oogonial stem cell ) isolation report human ovary ( 12 ) . ( 4 ) . However , know oogonial stem cell problem play part diseases premature ovarian failure diminish ovarian reserve . The goal protocol characterize oogonial stem cell patient primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) /failure ( POF ) diminish ovarian reserve ( DOR ) . There three group study : patient POI POF undergo ovarian biopsy laparoscopy , patient POI POF undergo clinically indicate abdominal surgery provide access ovary , patient 18 undergo clinically indicate ovarian surgery ( without POI POF ) . Ovarian biopsy harvest laparoscopy time indicated surgery , oogonial stem cell isolated laboratory characterize .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subject able give consent/assent participate protocol . Listed acceptable medical condition inclusion protocol : Females older 18 year POI , POF , DOR , undergo ovarian biopsy laparoscopy clinically indicate abdominal surgery provide access ovary Clinical etiology POI may include , limited , idiopathic , autoimmune , chemotherapy relate , Turner syndrome Subjects must diagnosis premature ovarian failure diminish ovarian reserve define : 1 . Early follicular phase FSH &gt; 15 IU/L 2 . AMH &lt; 0.16 ng/ml level detection assay use Females old 18 year , without POI POF , undergo clinically indicate ovarian surgery EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Unable comprehend investigational nature protocol participation Positive pregnancy test Anticoagulation know coagulopathy Ovarian cancer History previous laparoscopy laparotomy reveal abdominal adhesion would preclude ovarian biopsy Previous bowel surgery .</criteria>
