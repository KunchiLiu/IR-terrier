	<brief_title>Effect Simvastatin Treatment Vaso-occlusive Pain Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) characterize recurrent vaso-occlusive episode chronic inflammatory state lead progressive multi-organ injury . The pathophysiology SCD relate endothelial dysfunction drive largely impaired nitric oxide ( NO ) homeostasis chronic inflammation . Through multiple mechanism , include upregulation NO , statins show confer protection endothelial injury , independent cholesterol-lowering property . By inhibit inflammation several common pathway lead vascular damage , simvastatin may help prevent acute chronic complication SCD . The objective study determine whether preliminary result show simvastatin-associated reduction plasma marker vascular injury translate reduction vaso-occlusive pain episode patient SCD . A web-based , smartphone-accessible electronic pain diary use monitor frequency intensity vaso-occlusive pain SCD patient treat single daily dose simvastatin .</detailed_description>
