	<brief_summary>High-dose chemotherapy follow autologous ( patient 's ) peripheral blood ( circulate blood ) stem cell ( cell divide form white cell , red cell cell help clot ) transplantation conventional treatment patient lymphoma ( cancer lymph gland ) Hodgkin 's disease ( cancer lymph gland ) first relapse ( recurrence disease ) . For patient complete response traditional chemotherapy , chance high tumor return even high-dose chemotherapy . To improve response decrease chance relapse , doctor use rituximab , antibody kill lymphoma cell , transplantation . These doctor report patient control tumor extended period time use rituximab high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation . How widely applicable know . The purpose clinical research trial confirm good control tumor patient lymphoma Hodgkin 's disease treat rituximab conventional stem cell transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituxan + BEAM Auto Stem Cell Transplant High Risk Lymphoma Hodgkin 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects receive chemotherapy plastic tube ( catheter ) place vein collarbone . The antibody rituximab give day admission . The subject also start six-day course chemotherapy time . The chemotherapy consist follow drug : BCNU , etoposide also call VP-16 , Ara-C also call cytosine arabinoside , melphalan . BCNU give first day , Ara-C VP-16 second , third , fourth fifth day , melphalan sixth day . The infusion blood stem cell give catheter day last dose chemotherapy . This call Day 0 . A week later subject receive shot skin Neupogen help stem cell grow quickly . Three additional dos rituximab give weekly start 2 week later . If subject recovers discharge hospital get dos rituximab , receive remainder clinic . Patients remain hospital approximately 3-4 week , Houston area 30 day infusion donor cell . The patient blood , urine , bone marrow , x-ray examination perform necessary monitor result treatment . They blood test daily hospitalize . As outpatient , patient monitor make sure immune system ( system body help protect body fight bacterial , viral fungal infection ) recover , patient may require additional infusion immunoglobulin ( infection-fighting blood protein ) blood protein level safe . The patient also take antibiotic pill 6 month prevent infection . They x-rays diagnostic test ( PET scan ) every 6-12 month next 5 year make sure tumor stay control .</detailed_description>
