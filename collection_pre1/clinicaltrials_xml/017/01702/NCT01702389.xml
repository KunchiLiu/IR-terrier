	<brief_summary>Remifentanil rapid-acting opioid widely use pain treatment surgery last 15 year 1 . Remifentanil rapidly eliminate ( minute ) body end infusion , make easily manageable compare opioids . However , experimental clinical study indicate remifentanil , end infusion , trigger increase pain sensation increase opioid consumption post-operatively . Increased post-operative opioid consumption avoid due adverse effect drug ( nausea/vomiting , pruritus , dizziness , fatigue reduce respiratory rate ) . Thus , 's important investigate relevant strategy avoid increase pain sensation ( opioid-induced hyperalgesia = hypersensitivity pain stimulus ) end infusion remifentanil surgery . Several experimental clinical trial conduct field . Ketamine show block effect , adverse effect profile ( i.a . hallucination ) make suitable normal clinical use . In study healthy volunteer , demonstrate parecoxib ( COX-2 selective NSAID ) prevent remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia . Our group previously show relatively COX-1 selective NSAID ( ketorolac ) prevent hyperalgesia experimental pain model . This interest since NSAIDs frequently administer premedication surgery . There several disadvantage associate use COX-2 inhibitor , e.g . risk myocardial infarction long-term use ( &gt; 1 year ) , potentially reduce bone heal orthopedic surgery . However , show short-term use ( days/week ) . The disadvantage associate use e.g . ketorolac ( COX-1 inhibitor ) i.a . increase bleeding tendency , unfavourable surgeon , increase risk gastric ulcer . Therefore , interest investigate way prevent opioid-induced hyperalgesia . In recent animal study show gradual dose reduction remifentanil ( vs. abrupt withdrawal relatively high remifentanil dose ) prevent development hyperalgesia end infusion . In study i.a . investigate whether also case human . In new model , study participant get remifentanil infusion two different dose reduction regime : gradual reduction abrupt withdrawal .</brief_summary>
