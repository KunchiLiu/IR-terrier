	<detailed_description>Perennial allergic rhinitis may define clinically inflammatory condition nose characterise nasal obstruction , sneeze , itch , rhinorrhoea . It occur due exaggerated response environmental trigger result inflammation line nose ; similar hayfever , however , substance cause allergic reaction present year round ; common cause include faecal matter house dust-mite ( Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus ) , animal protein domestic pet ( saliva skin protein ) , industrial dust fume In perennial rhinitis , cigarette smoke , wash powder , detergent , strong perfume , traffic fume may exacerbate condition . According WAO ( World Allergy Organization ) , perennial rhinitis predominates South America , Asia , Africa Australia ; perennial seasonal rhinitis occur commonly U.S.A. Japan . Seasonal rhinitis predominate Europe . In one study London adult age 16 65 year , 1991 prevalence rhinitis 16 % ; , 8 % perennial symptom , 6 % perennial seasonal symptom , 2 % seasonal symptom alone . As asthma , seasonal perennial rhinitis seem increase . The 2004-05 National Health Survey state 3.2 million Australians ( approximately 16.1 % population ) self-reported experience symptom hay-fever perennial rhinitis . The prevalence find high amongst age 25-34 slightly high among female ( 1.7 million ) male ( 1.5 million ) . Perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR ) seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) result immunological response mediate IgE ; also Th2 cell component accounting chronic symptom . Histamine well-known mediator responsible sign symptom SAR many mediator include leukotrienes prostaglandin D2 involve . The management perennial rhinitis involve avoidance trigger house dust-mite faeces animal protein , conjunction pharmacological treatment : Corticosteroids Budesonide , Mometasone furoate , form nasal spray first-line treatment perennial allergic rhinitis . Antihistamines Cetirizine hydrochloride , Fexofenadine hydrochloride , work block effect histamine one main substance drive allergic reaction . Decongestants Phenylephrine hydrochloride , may take orally nasal spray reduce secretion swell line nose constrict blood vessel nose . Anti-inflammatories Sodium cromoglycate , block inflammatory pathway cause symptom perennial rhinitis , however , find effective corticosteroid antihistamine . Eye drop Ketotifen fumarate , Hydrocortisone acetate , may use control symptom itchy watery eye . Allergen desensitisation involve expose patient small dos allergens attempt desensitize prevent allergic response . Corticosteroids , report , form nasal spray first-line treatment perennial allergic rhinitis ; one widely use mometasone furoate . A meta-analysis randomized , double blind , placebo control , clinical trial mometasone furoate nasal spray treatment allergic rhinitis , comprehensive search MEDLINE , LILACS , SCOPUS , Cochrane Library databases 31 October , 2007 carry . Meta-analysis perform random fixed effect model depend heterogeneity , use revman 5 software sixteen 113 identified article meet inclusion criterion . This meta-analysis provide level Ia evidence efficacy MFSN treatment v placebo , adverse event frequency similar group . On basis decide design trial show therapeutic equivalence generic mometasone product drug NasonexÂ® Nasal Spray already market . Number patient : 298 complete patient Perennial Allergic Rhinitis require study ; plan drop-out rate 20 % , 360 patient enrol . Main Inclusion Criteria : Male female , 12 year 65 year old .

A score least 6 TNSS minimum score least 2 `` nasal congestion '' minimum score least 2 one remain 3 symptom . Subjects capable record nasal allergy diary every day . Main Exclusion Criteria : Females pregnant , lactate plan get pregnant study . History asthma previous two year require chronic therapy ( exception occasional acute mild exercise induce asthma ) . Patients nasal condition ( i.e . infectious sinusitis , hypertrophic rhinitis ) , clinically significant nasal deformity recent nasal surgery trauma completely heal . Upper respiratory tract infection untreated systemic infection within previous 30 day . Patients previously treat mometasone within previous 30 day Patients receive anti-allergy immunotherapy ( desensitise subject increase allergen challenge ) previous 2 year still receive kind therapy . Patients history tuberculosis . Patients glaucoma , cataract , ocular herpes simplex , conjunctivitis eye infection . The patient recent exposure ( 30 day ) risk expose chicken pox measles . Any known hypersensitivity mometasone , steroids component study nasal spray . Planned travel outside local area 2 consecutive day 3 day total .
