	<detailed_description>GSK2251052 member novel mechanistic structural class antibiotic inhibit bacterial enzyme leucyl tRNA synthetase ( LeuRS ) form boron adduct tRNA currently development treatment hospital acquire Gramnegative infection ( include E. coli , K. pneumoniae , Enterobacter spp. ) . This multi-part study . Part A randomized , open-label , single dose , three-period , incomplete block design evaluate relative bioavailability five oral formulation GSK2251052 . Approximately 24 healthy subject enrol receive treatment GSK2251052 dose 2000 mg randomize receive three follow five formulation : 1 ) enteric-coated tablet ( Treatment A ) , 2 ) modify release tablet ( Treatment B ) , 3 ) enteric-coated powder oral suspension ( Treatment C ) , 4 ) immediate release tablet ( Treatment D ) , 5 ) oral solution ( Treatment E ) . One two formulation Part A select basis acceptable safety pharmacokinetic criterion dose evaluation Part B . If formulation deem desired PK characteristic , Part B conduct . Part B randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation evaluation select formulation ( ) Part A . Approximately 8 subject randomly assign receive GSK2251052 plan start dose 2000 mg respective placebo Period 1 . In Period 2 , next dose level administer increment 500 mg and/or base PK safety precede period . Additional period may conduct select formulation pending acceptable safety order achieve target pharmacokinetic concentration . Part C randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled , two-cohort , two period , crossover study select formulation GSK2251052 Part B evaluate multiple-dose safety pharmacokinetics young elderly , male female healthy volunteer . Approximately 16 subject enrol ( 8 per cohort equal number female possible ) randomize receive either active treatment placebo 5 day fast meal . Cohorts evaluate sequentially , cohort 1 ( young ) conduct first , pending acceptable safety , proceed evaluation cohort 2 ( elderly ) subsequently . Part D identical design conduct Part C except evaluate multipledose pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability immediate release formulation give thrice daily dose 2000 mg. Part D conditional conduct none new formulation demonstrate appropriate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability . This study conduct single center Australia .</detailed_description>
