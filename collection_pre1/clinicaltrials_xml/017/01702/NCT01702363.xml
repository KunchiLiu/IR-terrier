	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) treatment guideline recommend incremental approach pharmacological treatment disease state worsens , involve use combination drug class different complementary mechanism action [ Celli , 2004 , GOLD 2009 ] . As disease progress mild moderate , regular treatment one long-acting bronchodilator recommend . Inhaled bronchodilator , include beta2 agonist anticholinergic include inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy mainstay therapy patient diagnose COPD . Since GSK573719 Inhalation Powder expect use chronic management COPD long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) , study intend evaluate safety tolerability long-term administration GSK573719 Inhalation Powder 125 mcg Japanese patient COPD dos possibly use Japan . In study , patient safety also monitor evaluate pulmonary function clinical symptom .</detailed_description>
