	<detailed_description>Synopsis : There important gap understand pathogenesis management statin-associated myalgia . Data suggest statin block production CoQ10 , essential component electron transport oxidative phosphorylation lead mitochondrial dysfunction . Preliminary data suggest CoQ10 dietary supplement may improve statin-associated muscle symptom ; however , correlation plasma CoQ10 objective test ass statin-associated myalgia response treatment lack . Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31P-MRS ) unique ability study , continuously non-invasively , biochemical pathway supply utilization energy muscle . The post-exercise recovery rate skeletal muscle phosphocreatine ( PCr ) validate index mitochondrial oxidative capacity vivo . In preliminary study , measure PCr recovery kinetics follow exercise , use 31P-MRS initiating statin therapy find return metabolic equilibrium longer 4 week statin therapy , suggest mitochondrial impairment . It primary hypothesis statin drug impair skeletal muscle mitochondrial function ubiquinol supplementation block impairment PCr recovery kinetics patient use statin . We propose pilot study extend research examine PCr recovery kinetics 20 statin user randomize parallel arm study either ubiquinol placebo 4 week . This study include 10 individual statin myalgia confirm statin rechallenge ( 5 assign arm ) , recruit ongoing clinical trial statin user suspect statin myalgia ( base clinical history ) undergo observe statin re-challenge confirm statin myalgia . Confirmation re-challenge important , one-third one-half report clinical history statin myalgia demonstrate statin myalgia , confirm improvement symptom statin discontinue return symptom undergo observed statin re-challenge . ii Our team unique 1 ) demonstrate feasibility perform 31P-MRS study patient hypercholesterolemia 2 ) access individual proven statin myalgia standardize observed statin-rechallenge . We believe data obtain study provide critical data need support application NIH full-scale clinical trial explore relationship statin use , PCr recovery rate , ubiquinol therapy . Aims : 1. Aim : To compare effect ubiqunol post exercise PCr recovery kinetics . We hypothesize statin user randomize 300 mg ubiquinol twice daily demonstrate shorter PCr recovery kinetics follow exercise compare statin user randomize placebo . 2. Aims : To assess association plasma CoQ10 1 ) post exercise PCr recovery kinetics 2 ) inflammatory vascular biomarkers We hypothesize low plasma CoQ10 concentration associate longer PCr recovery kinetics low inflammatory/vascular biomarkers . Exploratory Aims : In arm aim include 5 individual previously confirm statin myalgia statin rechallenge explore difference among statin user without statin myalgia . We evaluate trend assess whether statin user previously confirm statin myalgia show longer PCr recovery kinetics compare statin user without statin myalgia . Study Design : A pilot randomize placebo-controlled double-blinded study ( pre-post statin use ) comparing effect ubiquinol post exercise PCr recovery kinetics 4 week . Background Rationale Statins , HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor generally safe ; however , myalgia ( e.g. , pain , cramping , muscle soreness and/or weakness ) occur 5 % user iii , iv seriously impact quality life adherence statin medication . Furthermore , objective , non-invasive method assess track mild-moderate muscle symptom , common often occur without significant muscle enzyme `` CK '' elevation . Muscle biopsy use ass severe myopathy use evaluate statin myalgia without CK elevation , invasive , painful , provide single time point measurement . In contrast invasive muscle biopsy , 31P-MRS non-invasive validate technique apply study metabolic process skeletal muscle many muscle application diseases.v , vi The rate PCr recovery follow exercise accept gold standard measure mitochondrial function . We propose apply 31P-MRS important problem statin-associated myalgia measure rate PCr recovery follow exercise statin user statin therapy ( concurrent randomization ubiquinol placebo ) . Ultimately , believe work could important impact care management statin myalgia 1 ) elucidate relationship muscle symptom mitochondrial function quantifiable , validate non-invasive biochemical index 2 ) determine effect supplemental ubiquinol mitochondrial function muscle side effect statin user . Methods We measure rate PCr resynthesis ( time constant PCr recovery ) follow control exercise protocol recruit muscle low leg . We evaluate muscle symptom use standardized questionnaire measure muscle strength use ergometer design apply control variable pressure foot pedal pneumatic cylinder . We perform baseline measurement participant take statin medication CoQ10 supplement ( applicable ) least 2 week . Additionally , statin myalgia improvement symptom baseline measure take . Following baseline test , statin therapy+ubiquinol statin therapy+placebo give participant 4 week . Repeat measurement perform 4 week compare effect statins+placebo versus statin+ubiquinol PCr resynthesis . The primary outcome study PCr recovery time constant . The post-exercise PCr recovery measurement perform MRI research facility use dedicate 3T research MR scanner . Assessment safety outcome ( CK , AST , ALT ) , physiological parameter ( BP , HR , height weight measure ) , blood measure lipids biomarkers ( CRP , IL-6 , TNF- Î± , E-selectin , VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 ) collect site analyze Harvard Catalyst Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) Core laboratory . Analysis reduce oxidized plasma CoQ10 perform qualified outside lab strong track record use validate method . Data Analysis Statistical Analysis : Each subject PCr concentration collect follow 2 time point : pre-statin ( t1 ) , 4-weeks statin therapy ( ubiquinol placebo ) ( t2 ) . At time point , series measurement PCr concentration collect . For subject , estimate parameter use maximum likelihood estimation method . Thus obtain point estimate standard error time constant parameter subject time point . We compute relative percent change baseline post-statin ( ubiquinol vs. placebo ) time point linear mixed effect model obtain estimate relative change baseline relative change post-statin time point . The linear mixed effect model , compound symmetry structure variance-covariance matrix within-subject PCr relative change baseline take account within-subject correlation . The estimation linear mixed-effects model do via restrict maximum likelihood method . The PCr recovery time constant calculate use monoexponential fit PCr versus time , begin exercise completion compare group . Additional analyse perform assess association plasma CoQ10 ( adjust LDL ) PCr data , inflammatory vascular biomarkers , measure muscle strength ( ) , report symptom ( among statin myalgia ) .</detailed_description>
