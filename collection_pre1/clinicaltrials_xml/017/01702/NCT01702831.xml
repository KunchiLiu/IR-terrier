	<detailed_description>STUDY RATIONALE AND PURPOSE : A number strategy propose improve outcome ASCT . The three main strategy incorporate novel agent induction regimen , use maintenance therapy follow ASCT final strategy enhance conditioning regimen . Investigators would like explore three strategy study : Investigators propose take patient standard novel agent ( bortezomib ) base induction regimen study use dose-adjusted combination busulfan melphalan condition regimen finally Investigators would like incorporate lenalidomide maintenance post ASCT disease progression . The conventional immunological marker use define myeloma disease status also subject debate recently report suggest accurate disease assessment tool need well decide management disease . One promising assay increasingly accept sensitive indicator myeloma disease status Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD ) analysis . Therefore , Investigators plan use MRD analysis disease assessment tool throughout study correlate conventional myeloma disease assessment tool . Investigators would also like incorporate newly develop assay - Heavy lite ( HevyLite ) Chain assay explore feasibility use optional cell free DNA ( cfDNA ) detect monitor response assessment multiple myeloma , - do time point disease assessment thereby allow u explore viability assay clinical practice . INTERVENTIONS : Conditioning Regimen IV Busulfan 3.2mg/kg equivalent pharmacokinetics direct dose daily 3-hour infusion day -5 , -4 -3 ( option 1 ) day -6 , -5 , -4 ( option 2 ) .IV Melphalan 140mg/m2 day -2 ( option 1 ) day -3 ( option 2 ) Maintenance Regimen Oral Lenalidomide 10 mg daily 28 day 28 day cycle first three cycle dose escalation 15 mg daily clinically appropriate . STUDY ENDPOINTS Primary : • MRD negativity day 100 post ASCT Secondary : - To determine pattern MRD analysis lenalidomide maintenance . - To determine response rate use conventional immunoglobulin-based marker day 100 post ASCT best response use lenalidomide maintenance . - To determine effectiveness use Heavy lite ( HevyLite ) Chain assay assess anti-tumour response day 100 post ASCT lenalidomide maintenance . - To determine toxicity busulfan melphalan use high-dose conditioning therapy ASCT . - To determine toxicity lenalidomide maintenance post busulfan melphalan condition ASCT . - To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) program . - To determine , whole exome sequence individual Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) patient , type frequency somatic abnormality ( point mutation , indels , copy number abnormality ) evolution overtime clinical disease progress . - To explore feasibility use optional cell free DNA ( cfDNA ) detect monitor response assessment multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>
