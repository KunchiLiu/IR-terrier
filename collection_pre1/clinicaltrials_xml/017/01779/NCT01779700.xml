	<detailed_description>Study Design : This single site safety proof concept study conduct Indiana University Psychotic Disorders Program . Forty subject schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder randomize 1:1 double-blind treatment fingolimod match placebo duration 8 week . All subject admit Indiana Clinical Translational Sciences Institute Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) remain hospitalized first 24 ( +/- 2 ) hour post initial dose study medication . The CRC locate Indiana University Hospital 24 hour staff nurse skilled conduct Phase 1 Phase 2 investigational drug study . Background Rationale : Schizophrenia severe brain disorder begin teenage year early twenty typically progress life-long chronic illness mark psychotic symptom , cognitive impairment poor functioning . A leading hypothesis account symptom cognitive dysfunction disorder abnormality exist cortical circuit , particularly frontal temporal area . An interest cortical circuitry lead focus integrity cortical white matter tract possibly contribute pathophysiology illness . Indeed , several line evidence support abnormality white matter structure function schizophrenia . Numerous myelin-related gene functional expression associate schizophrenia . Moreover , quantitative qualitative abnormality prefrontal cortical oligodendrocyte find postmortem study . MRI-determined volumetric reduction prefrontal white matter report schizophrenia . Advances MRI technology enhance ability study white matter pathology vivo . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) fractional anisotropy ( FA ) provide assessment density integrity white matter tract . Decreased FA report many de-myelinating disease include multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , leukodystrophies , HIV . Numerous study use DTI report decrement FA schizophrenia consistent abnormality occur frontal cortical white matter . Also , FA show sensitive therapeutic drug effect MS support DTI-derived FA outcome measure clinical trial neuroprotective agent . Fingolimod ( FTY720 , approve Gilenya™ ) sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) receptor modulator recently license USA several country relapse form multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . It administer per day oral preparation . In registration clinical trial , positive effect brain atrophy , MRI-determined axonal lesion relapse rate . Significant improvement mean number MRI assess T1 gadolinium ( Gd ) enhance lesions/patient percentage patient free T1 Gd-enhanced lesion observe within 6 month treatment evidence clinical improvement early 2 month treatment initiation</detailed_description>
