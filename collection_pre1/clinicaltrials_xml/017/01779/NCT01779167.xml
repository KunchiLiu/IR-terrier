	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety daily alternate thalidomide lenalidomide plus rituximab ( ThRiL ) patient previously treat Waldenstrom macroglobulunemia ( WM ) . Thalidomide lenalidomide drug modulate immune system show bring response subject WM . However , use limit due side effect . The investigator hypothesize alternate dos thalidomide lenalidomide may alleviate side effect preserve effectiveness therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia ( WM ) incurable B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterize expansion malignant B-lymphocytes excessive production monoclonal IgM . The survival proliferation neoplastic WM cell highly dependent signal microenvironment . Thalidomide lenalidomide immunomodulatory agent single agent activity WM . Their use limit significant toxicity , include tumor flare ( thalidomide lenalidomide ) ; sedation , constipation , neuropathy ( thalidomide ) ; cytopenia ( lenalidomide ) . Alternating dos thalidomide lenalidomide may alleviate toxicity , preserve efficacy since agent non-overlapping toxicity yet similar hypothesize mechanisms action . Additionally , start low dose lenalidomide previously study WM may allow improved tolerability . A pilot study daily alternate therapy subject chronic lymphocytic leukemia demonstrate two agent could combine non-overlapping toxicity . This phase II study aim evaluate efficacy safety daily alternate thalidomide lenalidomide plus rituximab ( ThRiL ) subject previously treat WM . Subjects receive thalidomide 50 mg every day ( i.e. , every odd day : day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 &amp; 27 28 day cycle ) alternate lenalidomide every day ( i.e. , every even day : day 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 &amp; 28 28 day cycle ) , dose base upon stepwise incremental dosing . Rituximab 375 mg/m2 administer day 1 , 8 , 15 22 start Cycle 1 weekly x 4 schedule every 6th cycle thereafter ( Cycles 7 , 13 , 19 , etc ) .</detailed_description>
