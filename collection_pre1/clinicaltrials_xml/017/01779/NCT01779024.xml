	<brief_summary>Background : - Ghrelin hormone human body mostly produce stomach . It make people feel hungry , also connect desire drink alcohol . Researchers want test ghrelin see use control alcohol craving use . They compare dos ghrelin placebo people drink heavily . Objectives : - To study effect ghrelin alcohol craving use . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 60 year age heavy drinker seek treatment alcohol use . - Participants must average 20 drink per week men , 15 drink per week woman . Design : - Participants screen visit , four 2-night study visit , follow-up visit . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They provide urine breath sample drug test . They also answer question mood physical symptom , alcohol craving . - At study visit , participant stay overnight National Institutes Health clinical center . They spend night center , test next day , go home follow morning . At visit , participant receive ghrelin placebo infusion , complete series task . - For first second study visit , participant test alcohol crave use . They able receive alcohol infusion computer program test response time crave reaction . At time , ghrelin placebo infusion . Blood alcohol level , reaction time , crave study . - For third fourth study visit , participant magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study . They initial MRI provide picture brain . They functional MRI respond computer test . The test allow win point snack food alcohol . This test look brain 's response time crave reaction . - There follow-up visit 1 week fourth study visit . Some test screen visit repeat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Ghrelin 28-amino acid peptide act endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) . Ghrelin stimulate appetite acting hypothalamic arcuate nucleus ( ARC ) , region control intake food substance , include alcohol . In addition ARC , GHS receptor ( GHS-Rs ) also highly express caudal brain stem , ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , hippocampus , substantia nigra , dorsal medial raphe nucleus . The expression GHS-R mesolimbic dopamine ( DA ) pathway suggest ghrelin could play role reward processing . The role ghrelin DA reward processing role DA reward system alcoholism suggest role ghrelin alcoholism . Consistent hypothesis , preclinical study demonstrate ghrelin ethanol activate cholinergic-dopaminergic reward link , imply neurochemical analogy ghrelin ethanol . This support hypothesis ghrelin involve mediate reward property ethanol . Additional animal experiment demonstrate central ghrelin action stimulate reward processing also require stimulation system alcohol . Human study show reduce ghrelin level actively drink alcoholic ; increase ghrelin level alcohol abstinence ; positive correlation ghrelin level alcohol crave score . More recently , study conduct Brown University PI demonstrate safety administration IV human ghrelin non-treatment seek alcohol-dependent heavy drinking individual . Furthermore , preliminary interim analysis show IV ghrelin administration may lead temporary significant increase alcohol crave . The primary objective protocol investigate whether IV ghrelin , compare placebo , increase motivation alcohol reward , measure progressive ratio ( PR ) schedule paradigm IV alcohol self-infusion ( primary aim ) . We also assess number secondary aim . Specifically , also ass whether IV ghrelin , compare placebo , also alter urge drink subjective response IV alcohol . Adverse event also assess ensure safety IV coadministration ghrelin alcohol . During fMRI/alcohol clamp session , fMRI use see whether ghrelin affect activation ventral striatum induce acute IV alcohol administration incentive salience cue associate alcohol administration . Study Population : Male female participant non-treatment seek heavy drinking volunteer . Design : The study design within-subject , double-blind , placebo-controlled study ghrelin . The first visit initial screen visit . The second third visit PR session IV ethanol , participant also receive IV ghrelin ( match placebo ) . The fourth fifth visit combine fMRI session alcohol clamp ' session ( i.e . fix dose alcohol administer ) subject participate modify version monetary incentive delay ( MID ) task respond cue indicate opportunity press button gain reward . On trial reward point exchange snack food trial reward point determine much intravenous alcohol subject give alcohol clamp procedure immediately follow modify MID task . After modify MID task complete subject short break begin alcohol IV infusion . Outcome measure : The primary measure study breakpoint , schedule ( number button press ) individual stops work alcohol . Also , BrAC exposure measure determine . Alcohol crave response ghrelin measure use Alcohol Visual Analogue Scale ( A-VAS ) Alcohol Urge Questionnaire ( AUQ ) PR session . Sensitivity alcohol measure use Drug Effects Questionnaire ( DEQ ) , Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale ( BAES ) , Profile Mood States ( POMS ) , repeatedly PR session . fMRI BOLD signal brain area associate incentive salience area associate reward circuitry ( include ventral striatum ) measure fMRI/alcohol clamp session . This study may facilitate identification novel neuropharmacological target , thus facilitate development novel pharmacological treatment alcoholism .</detailed_description>
