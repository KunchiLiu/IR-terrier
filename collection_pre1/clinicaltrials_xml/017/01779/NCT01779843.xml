	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I trials test safety investigational drug combination drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug still study research doctor try find . As part research study , take alisertib combination idarubicin cytarabine . Alisertib approve FDA cancer . However , cytarabine idarubicin approve FDA treatment AML . It also mean FDA approve give alisertib idarubicin cytarabine use patient , include patient type cancer . Idarubicin cytarabine chemotherapy agent commonly use treat individual diagnose AML . Alisertib use laboratory study study suggest alisertib may slow spread cancer . It block certain substance need cancer cell spread . In study , researcher would like combine alisertib standard chemotherapy ( cytarabine idarubicin ) order see give safely chemotherapy individual AML . The primary purpose research study determine high dose alisertib give idarubicin cytarabine without severe unmanageable side effect . The dose identify study use future research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree take part study ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may need repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , physical exam , performance status , urine test , Electrocardiogram , Echocardiogram , blood test bone marrow aspirate/biopsy . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . You begin treatment idarubicin , cytarabine follow alisertib several day later ( day 8 ) . Not everyone participate research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . The following assessment complete trial : physical exam , performance status , urine test , blood test , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy . The first part study procedure call `` induction '' . During induction admit hospital in-patient basis . You receive cytarabine idarubicin IV ( intravenously vein ) . Cytarabine give continuous IV infusion seven day , begin Day 1 . Idarubicin give day IV injection total three day , begin day cytarabine . If idarubicin available , may receive similar chemotherapy place call daunorubicin . Alisertib give orally ( mouth ) twice day one week . It start second week treatment . A bone marrow biopsy perform approximately 14 day start chemotherapy . If result biopsy detect residual leukemia bone marrow , physician may give another round induction therapy . However , time , cytarabine give continuous IV infusion five day , idarubicin give day IV injection total 2 day , begin day cytarabine . If end first cycle induction ( whether 've receive one round two round induction ) number leukemia cell decrease much expect desire , remove study give alternative option . The second part study procedure call `` consolidation '' . If achieve remission induction phase , candidate bone marrow transplant , tolerate study drug well induction , may receive consolidation treatment . Soem participant may receive consolidation therapy trial , base advice treat physician . For consolidation , receive high dose cytarabine induction . You hospitalized cytarabine give daily IV infusion five day . Alisertib also give consolidation phase therapy . It start end cytarabine administration give total seven day . You may receive four cycle consolidation treatment , depend disease discretion treat physician . The third part study procedure call `` maintenance '' . After induction course therapy , physician may begin consolidation therapy . If case , start maintenance therapy finish consolidation therapy . If consolidation do , maintenance phase start induction . During maintenance , take alisertib twice daily period seven day , follow two week break without treatment . This one week therapy , follow two week therapy , 21-day cycle . It repeat 12 month pass start maintenance therapy phase . During phase , participant receive chemotherapy hospitalize treatment . They take alisertib home follow clinic monitoring . During maintenance phase , continue collect approximately 2 3 teaspoon blood research purpose intermittently visit clinic . After final dose study drug would like keep track medical condition overall health follow 12 month alisertib . We may ask question general health , current medication , disease status . We also check new anticancer therapy may start .</detailed_description>
