	<criteria>PreRegistration Histologically confirm HER2negative primary invasive ductal invasive lobular breast carcinoma . For patient enrol neoadjuvant treatment , diagnosis must clinical stage II III ; patient enrol adjuvant treatment , diagnosis must pathologic stage IIA IIIC . Standard HER2 test perform surgical specimen Washington University accord standard care Department Pathology . A HER2negative primary breast cancer sample patient eligible randomization HER2 IHC score 0 1+ Those patient IHC score 2+ HER2 FISHnegative standard test . Patient undergone stag study include CT chest/abdomen/pelvis bone scan and/or PET scan either prior initiation treatment prior entry trial . In addition , patient nonmetastatic , HER2negative , recurrent tumor need chemotherapy eligible . Planning receive best practice adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy accord institutional guideline . Adjuvant tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor treatment allow hormone receptorpositive patient . Patients fail neoadjuvant endocrine therapy also eligible . At least 18 year old . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 1 . Patient ( legally authorize representative ) must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . PreRegistration Prior chemotherapy cancer ( exclude initiation best practice chemotherapy give standard care describe protocol , may initiate preregistration bone marrow collection final confirmation eligibility randomization ) . Previous treatment trastuzumab Her2 target therapy . Presence uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Registration Inclusion Criteria Presence bone marrow ERBB2 overexpressing DTCs time diagnosis ; bone marrow aspiration perform consented patient evaluate DTCs follow preregistration provide patient meet eligibility criterion describe section .
