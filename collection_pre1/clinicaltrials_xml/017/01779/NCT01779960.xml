	<brief_summary>Up moment , majority study assess level physical activity daily life patient COPD limit cross-sectional design , take account natural variation physical activity daily life due difference climatic condition face throughout year . Preliminary evidence suggest patient COPD different physical activity level accord season year . However , limited current evidence allow u know magnitude difference level daily physical activity patient COPD take account climatic change result different season year city country contrast climatic condition . This gap observe literature allow u moment know whether consider season year one main cause variability assess physical activity daily life patient COPD . The present project propose investigate hypothesis patient COPD live place less marked decrease temperature summer winter ( Londrina , Brazil ) less variability level physical activity daily life year comparison patient live place mark climatic variability season ( Leuven , Belgium ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Summer-Winter Variability Level Physical Activity Daily Life Brazilian Belgian Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sample compose least 20 patient moderate-severe COPD institution involve ( Catholic University Leuven , Belgium State University Londrina , Brazil ) , add 40 patient ( see sample size calculation ) . However , sample size could increase necessary achieve intermediate calculation sample power perform study . Both group similar concern anthropometric characteristic , gender distribution severity feature disease ( especially FEV1 ) . Therefore , eventual increase final number patient may also necessary case similarity achieve final data collection plan sample . Data collection perform Laboratory Research Respiratory Physiotherapy State University Londrina ( Londrina , Brazil ) University Hospital Gasthuisberg Catholic University Leuven ( Leuven , Belgium ) . The study longitudinal design . Two group patient , one group Londrina another group Leuven , simultaneously objectively evaluated concern physical activity daily life one week two different moment : January 2013 ( winter Leuven summer Londrina ) , two group patient simultaneously re-evaluated another week July 2013 ( summer Leuven winter Londrina ) . Changes level physical activity daily life summer winter two group compare . Monitoring physical activity daily life : two activity monitor ( SenseWear armband Fitbit ) simultaneously worn 7 consecutive day . The SenseWear armband ( BodyMedia , Pittsburg , PA , USA ) multisensor compose biaxial accelerometer physiologic sensor . It small ( 8.8 x 5.6 x 2 cm ) lightweight ( 82g ) monitor worn upper right arm already validate energy expenditure estimation patient COPD [ 12,13 ] . The Fitbit ( Fitbit , Inc. , San Francisco , CA , USA ) recently release triaxial accelerometer small ( 3.6 x 2.9 x 1 cm ) lightweight ( 8g ) SenseWear . According manufacturer , Fitbit use different position , include waist . This device provide number step , distance walk energy expenditure calorie , among variable . In 7 day assessment , patient remain device 24 hours/day . The patient strictly instruct avoid change daily physical activity habit monitor period . To characterize sample , patient submit spirometry , 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) quality life assessment ( Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire - CRQ ) , also describe detail subsection `` Methods '' . For patient , information also register : type drug use patient , dosage often drug use last month inclusion study ; characterization history acute exacerbation occur last year ( case ) ; presence respiratory insufficiency admission study period ( PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg and/or SpO2 &lt; 90 % without PaCo2 &gt; 50 mmHg , breathe room air ) ; need long-term oxygen supplementation previously study period ; practice regular physical activity last year . LOGISTICS INVOLVED IN DATA COLECTION IN BOTH CENTERS In first period data collection ( January 2013 ) , Brazilian coordinator project ( Prof. Fabio Pitta ) travel Leuven participate data collection organization site . The Brazilian project coordinator arrive Leuven two week data collection , conjunction Belgian coordinator project ( Prof. Thierry Troosters ) European researcher prepare necessary logistic action ensure adequate performance study . After preparation period , data collection perform three week , 15 patient assess first week 14 third week . Spirometry , 6MWT CRQ perform Friday , data collection physical activity perform Saturday next week 's Saturday . The 1-week interval first second week assessment use download data discuss eventual issue raise first week assessment , thus justifies need 15 activity monitor device ( SenseWear Fitbit ) center add 60 necessary device ( data collection simultaneously occur center ) . Previously , Brazilian team involve project prepared Brazilian coordinator instruction , since first period data collection Londrina occur simultaneously Leuven . Therefore , first period data collection Londrina perform Brazilian researcher involve study , coordinate Leuven Prof. Fabio Pitta . The research team make sure Brazilian researcher prepare trained perform assessment , include objective quantification physical activity daily life , well identical application 6MWT CRQ center . In second phase data collection ( July 2013 ) , European Brazilian researcher responsible assessment protocol train perform first phase data collection . Therefore , Prof. Fabio Pitta coordinate data collection Londrina Prof. Thierry Troosters coordinate data collection Leuven ensure reproducibility method second data collection moment.. After second phase data collection , project activity coordination centralize Londrina , Brazilian coordinator project . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Statistical analysis perform use SPSS v. 17 Statistical Package ( SPSS , Inc. , Chicago IL , EUA ) GraphPad Prism 5.0 ( GraphPad Software Inc. , San Diego , CA , EUA ) . The Shapiro-Wilk test initially use analyze normality data distribution . In case variable normally distribute , data describe mean Â± standard deviation , variables non-normal distribution describe median [ 25 % -75 % interquartile range ] . Summer-winter change group patient analyze paired test ( parametric analysis ) Wilcoxon test ( non-parametric analysis ) . Summer-winter difference two group patient ( Londrina Leuven ) analyze unpaired test ( parametric analysis ) Mann-Whitney ( non-parametric analysis ) . Variables spirometry , 6MWT CRQ group analyze unpaired test two assessment moment . Correlations analyze Pearson Spearman coefficient , depend normality data distribution . For analysis , statistical significance set p less 0.05 . The sample size study calculate accord assumption mean ( standard deviation ) difference counts/day two group patient COPD , one Europe one Brazil . The first group assess summer winter , find study Sewell et al . perform England [ 10 ] . This study present mean difference 5656 count ( 8857 summer 3201 winter ) , standard deviation 7497 2629 count , respectively . The second group base hypothesis ( little ) change physical activity daily life due seasonal variation Londrina ( Brasil ) base study Probst et al . ( Respiratory Care 2011 ; 56 [ 11 ] : 1799-87 ) , take account similar standard deviation 5063 counts/day . With power 90 % , alfa coefficient 0.05 , least 12 patient group necessary detect significant difference level physical activity daily life summer winter within group . Taking account eventual difficult set drop-out rate 40 % due difficulty data collection protocol involve motion sensor , minimum 20 patient include compose either group ( Londrina Leuven ) , add 40 patient total .</detailed_description>
