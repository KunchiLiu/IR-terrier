	<brief_title>A Phase 1a Trial Assessing Safety , Tolerability , Immunogenicity GS-4774 ( GI-13020 ) Various Dose Levels Regimens Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HBV specific T cell response show positive association infection status patient chronic HBV , weak T cell responses patient untreated chronic active infection strong T cell responses patient achieve seroconversion cure ( 4 ) . We generate Tarmogen express well conserve region HBV X , S , core antigen ( GS-4774 ) . GS-4774 immunogenic murine model also use stimulate human immune cell sample ex vivo elicit HBV specific T cell response could predict immune response patient dose GS-4774 . GS-4774 evaluate healthy volunteer study ass safety , tolerability , ability elicit HBV specific T cell response . In future GS-4774 could use combination HBV antiviral , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , attempt improve HBsAg seroconversion ( cure ) rate patient chronic HBV infection .</detailed_description>
