	<brief_summary>Exosomes form inward bud late endosomes , produce multivesicular body ( MVBs ) , release environment fusion MVBs plasma membrane . It demonstrate content function exosomes depend originate cell condition produce . Tumor exosome production , transfer education bone marrow cell support tumor growth metastasis . In prospective translational study , preclinical clinical phase design . On first step , main goal characterize molecular profile gastric cancer derive exosomes . This exosome biosignature may provide useful diagnostic tool . As second step , study evaluate prognostic predictive value gastric cancer exosomes level plasma kinetics prospectively recruit cohort advance gastric cancer patient first-line chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
