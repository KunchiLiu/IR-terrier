	<brief_summary>The RISE Adult Medication Study 4-arm , 3-center , clinical trial adult prediabetes early type 2 diabetes address hypothesis aggressive glucose lower lead recovery beta-cell function sustain withdrawal treatment . Adult participant ( age 20-65 ) randomize one follow treatment regimen : ( 1 ) blind placebo , ( 2 ) blind metformin alone , ( 3 ) early intensive insulin treatment basal insulin glargine follow open-label metformin , ( 4 ) glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1RA ) liraglutide plus open-label metformin . The primary clinical question RISE address : Are improvement ß-cell function follow 12 month active treatment maintain 3 month follow withdrawal therapy ? Secondary outcome assess durability glucose tolerance follow withdrawal therapy , whether biomarkers obtain fast state predict parameter ß-cell function , insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance response intervention .</brief_summary>
