	<brief_title>Intraoperative MRI-guidance Frameless Stereotactic Biopsies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Stereotactic brain biopsy ( STx biopsy ) offer relatively straightforward , accurate safe method obtain diagnostic tissue . Frameless computer-based neuronavigation widely use brain tumor surgery . It many advantage frame-based technique provide similar accuracy rigid frame . One method apply improve diagnostic yield safety usage intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( iMRI ) , propose Bernays et al . 2002 . Besides obvious indication give previous paper , include STx biopsy small , deeply localize cystic lesion , iMRI guidance particularly useful two case . The first one satisfactory 3D volume modality obtain preoperative high-field diagnostic MR imaging . When use iMRI need perform preoperative 3D image kind manually register patient 's head neuronavigation system operation , help significantly improve workflow . In study total amount patient insufficient neuroimaging - admit outside medical center - 30 % . The second case teaching purpose - frameless iMRI guide STx biopsy , relatively uncomplicated technically straightforward introduce first procedure train neurosurgical intraoperative imaging . Although usefulness ultra-low-field iMRI STx biopsy subsequently confirm author , accord knowledge previous publish study compare iMRI preoperative MRI brain tumor biopsy accord evidence-based medicine guideline ( EBM ) . Though method subject slight criticism , consequently apply neurosurgical daily practice recent year . The aim study verify safety effectiveness STx biopsy guide low-field iMRI comparison frameless classic analogue base prospective randomize parallel-group , control trial . In current paper present study design result interim analysis . MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients Patients - follow contemporary recommendation - schedule undergo STx biopsy , prospectively recruit study . Each patient sign write consent participate study . Inclusion criteria The inclusion criterion follow : male female patient ≥ 18 year supratentorial brain tumor schedule undergo STx biopsy . The estimated number patient need reveal difference 5 % primary endpoint ' - diagnostic yield complication ratio - level significance 0.05 power 80 % 465 per arm . Exclusion criterion Patients unable provide inform consent metal implant could prevent influence head MR study exclude study . Allocation Patients prospectively allocate minimization accord demographic ( gender , age ) epidemiologic data ( preoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status-ECOG- scale provide information neurological social status patient oncological disease , maximum tumor diameter , presence contrast enhancement , independent risk factor hemorrhage - basal thalamic localization preoperative diabetes ) iMRI control group . Intervention After transfer operating room patient sedate intravenous infusion Remifentanil passive oxygen therapy monitoring vital function . Additionally , site head holder pin skin incision anaesthetize 1 % Lignocaine . All biopsy group perform via 6 mm burr-hole use Vertec system ( Medtronic Navigation , Louisville , CO , USA ) . A passively navigated side cut 2.2 mm biopsy needle use . All operation perform one three first author . In iMRI-guided group head patient immobilize 3-pin iMRI-compatible head holder . The PoleStar N20 iMRI system ( Medtronic Navigation , Louisville , CO , USA ) 0.15-T constant magnet use procedure . Subsequently , patient 's positioning , preoperative reference examination routinely carry ( T1+gadolinum , T2 FLAIR weight - depend pathology , axial 4 mm scan ) . Images automatically transfer neuronavigation system ( StealthStation , Medtronic Navigation , Louisville , CO , USA ) . The entry point , target optimal biopsy trajectory define operator basis obtain iMRI image . Serial tissue sample ( 4 central another 4 marginal part tumor ) collect accord modify protocol describe Shooman et al. , make use intraoperative histopathological examination obsolete . Following operation , control iMRI ( T1-weighted , axial , 4 mm scan examination ) routinely perform confirm document proper target - propose Bernays et al . - exclude postoperative hyperacute intraparenchymal bleeding . A frameless STx biopsy perform patient control group use neuronavigation system . The entry point , target optimal biopsy trajectory define operator operation basis preoperatively obtain high-field MR image use neuronavigation workstation ( Cranial 5 , StealthStation Application Software , Medtronic Navigation , Louisville , CO , USA ) . Following surgery specimen send independent histopathological analysis . Postoperative care Postoperative care conduct accord standard protocol clinical guideline . A postoperative follow-up head CT subsequently perform 4 6 hour procedure . All patient follow clinical examination 2 week postoperatively perform independent blinded allocation investigator . Data collection Demographic epidemiological data collect prospectively . The primary endpoint : ratio acute postoperative complication diagnostic yield . The presence acute postoperative complication note following finding note : ( wound site infection two week operation , new neurological deficit develop 24 hour follow operation present follow clinical examination 2 week postoperatively ) , intraparenchymal hematoma radiological clinical sign intracranial expansion . ) diagnostic yield . The diagnostic yield express accord literature percentage patient histopathological diagnosis possible basis biological material obtain operation . Secondary endpoint include : preoperative ( LOSpre ) , postoperative ( LOSpost ) total length hospital stay ( LOS ) well preparation ( Tprep ) , operation ( Top ) total operating room ( TOR ) time . The LOS T routinely measure recorded central hospital file independent staff .</detailed_description>
