	<brief_summary>Background : PICC-related thrombosis show slightly different pattern frequency risk factor , compare traditional CVC ; increase diffusion PICCs , become somehow independent pathology , still investigation ; pharmacological prevention prove effective . Aim study estimate cumulative incidence thrombosis cohort patient carry PICC-line CVC , monitor allow early detection prevention complication relate presence asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis , explore role several potential risk factor . Methods : prospective observational cohort enroll 150 consecutive patient PICC insert team ; clinical characteristic , comorbidities main feature catheter position procedure register ; patient follow clinical echographic schedule control , weekly first month , monthly ; patient PRDVT treat LMWH recontrolled weekly removal catheter</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Detection PICC-related Deep Vein Thrombosis US Surveillance : Effective Approach Secondary Prevention ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All PICCs position trained physician nurse , ultrasonographic screen whole upper limb venous district , axillary , subclavian jugular vein detect possible pre-existing thrombosis ; position perform real-time ultrasonography guide portable device . Patients recontrolled one week positioning ; patient report pain , swell , fever , skin colour change , exit site tenderness , symptom suspect thrombosis infection , immediately see . A duplex ultrasound complete examination upper limb neck vessel perform , time whole arm exit site inspect exclude infection ; diagnostic criterion DVT include incompressibility vein direct visualisation PICC-surrounding thrombus ; uncertain case , doppler examination performed.If examination negative thrombosis , control perform 2,3,4 week positioning , month.If DVT detect , register position extension thrombus , main characteristic ( clot , mural occlusive thrombosis ) ; catheter leave place therapy prescribe LMWH full dos , accord ACCP guideline 2008 ( confirmed 2012 edition ) . Then , patient recontrolled weekly removal catheter .</detailed_description>
