	<brief_title>Clinical Study Oral IGF-1R Inhibitor Subjects With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open label multicentre Phase 1 study oral IGF-1R inhibitor PL225B subject advanced refractory solid tumor . This dose-finding trial use modify Accelerated Titration Design 3 new subject per cohort 100 % dose increment accelerate phase follow standard phase 40 % dose increments.Subjects receive study drug daily basis twenty-one ( 21 ) day accord dose schedule specify particular cohort therapy . Toxicity profile drug assess Cycle 1 subject treatment cohort determination Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) accord schedule give .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects histologically and/or cytologically confirm nonhaematological malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative treatment exist longer effective Subjects measurable evaluable disease Subjects either sex , race ethnic group , ≥18 year age ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status 01 Subjects life expectancy least 4 month Subjects fast plasma glucose ≤ 125 mg/dL HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % screening Subjects fast plasma glucose ≤150 mg/dL HbA1c ≤ 7.0 % screen Diabetes Expansion Cohort . For Diabetes Expansion Cohort Subjects know history type 2 diabetes mellitus wellcontrolled stable dose oral antidiabetic agent metformin and/or sulfonylureas 4 week prior screen . Subjects must normal organ marrow function define : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/cmm 2 . Platelets ≥ 100,000/cmm 3 . Total bilirubinwithin normal limit institution 4 .
