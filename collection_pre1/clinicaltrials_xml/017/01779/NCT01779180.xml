Provided parental consent , receive oral supplement 50,000 IU vitamin A placebo . Study design : This study follow-up study cohort child randomise NVAS ( intervention ) placebo ( current policy ) together BCG vaccine birth . Other exposure : The investigator also investigate effect receive additional dose measles vaccine time DTP vaccine development atopy . Assessment outcome : The investigator visit child last known address . Height , weight mid upper arm circumference measure . BCG scar examine vaccination card detail record field assistant . Children exclude skin prick testing ( SPT ) history suggestive anaphylaxis currently use anti-histamine medication . SPT perform use aero-allergens , food allergen positive histamine negative saline control . The mother guardian interview local assistant . Symptoms eczema asthma well food allergy assess . Statistical analysis : Effect randomisation group factor outcomes analyse multivariable regression model . All analysis adjust skin prick tester .
