	<detailed_description>Impairments attention among symptom frequently report parent teacher follow pediatric traumatic brain injury ( TBI_ . These cognitive disability responsible wide range academic adjustment issue . Broadly define , attention encompasses mental process , operation , system requisite acquire apply information . It interact cognitive function include perception , memory/learning , organization , reason ; attention core integration system . A number different attentional subcomponents interconnected neural system identify show differentially disrupt follow trauma brain disorder , include maintenance sustain attention , attentional selectivity , attentional capacity , ability effectively shift attention . Given prevalence attention difficulty secondary attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) follow TBI , imperative identify treatment effectively address attention impairment . The study develop pilot Attention Intervention Management program ( AIM ) . AIM focus direct attention training conjunction metacognitive strategy training . Strategies design improve focus self regulation , reduce distraction , enhance problem solve academic setting . Integration attention train metacognitive strategy help ensure student apply skill across setting situation . The Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) Phase 2 project address two interrelated hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : Children receive Attention Intervention Management ( AIM ) program evidence well performance standardized test attention executive function ( EF ) wait list control ( WLC ) group . Hypothesis 2 : Children receive AIM few attention EF problem WLC parent teacher rating scale attention EF . Participants include child age 10-18 significant evidence attentional impairment .</detailed_description>
