	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study develop optimize , clinically usable myocardial PET-MR perfusion protocol determine data potentially available acquire clinical myocardial perfusion examination . Hypothesis : The hypothesis high resolution , high sensitivity DCE MRI could replace rest PET myocardial perfusion imaging , significantly decrease examination time patient radiation dose maintain comprehensive reference-quality PET myocardial stress perfusion coverage . The primary outcome comparison diagnostic accuracy combination image detect clinically significant coronary artery stenosis ( â‰¥70 % diameter stenosis ) . The secondary outcome comparison confidence presence disease among data set .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Simultaneous acquisition PET-MRI new technology potential significantly impact diagnostic patient care . It combine high signal resolution MRI anatomic imaging PET biological measurement , add benefit radiation dose reduction comparison PET-CT. As incidence false positive SPECT-MPI study secondary attenuation artifact relatively high MRI coverage leave ventricular myocardium limit , likely one immediate application PET-MRI technology myocardial ischemia assessment . PET long consider noninvasive reference standard myocardial perfusion . However , delay contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI sensitive infarct detection . Indeed , PET MR image potential provide comprehensive whole heart ischemia infarct detection . PET-MR technology , ability obtain simultaneous perfusion information via PET MRI , potential obtain multiple , possibly redundant , data set . On hand , also potential combine best technique provide highly robust examination shorter low radiation dose standard myocardial PET perfusion examination . Optimization protocol necessary develop comprehensive protocol without redundancy . Because single injection capability , regadenoson ideally suit protocol assess employ dual-modality myocardial perfusion data collection . It expect best candidate PET-MR myocardial perfusion image likely ) patient whose body habitus suggest SPECT-MPI examination would limited attenuation artifact -- woman large breast patient ( usually men ) abdominal obesity and/or b ) patient may small region ischemia might miss MRI examination limit perfusion coverage .</detailed_description>
