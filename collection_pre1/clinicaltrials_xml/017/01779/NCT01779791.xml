	<brief_title>A Study PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) Patients With Refractory Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) study PCI-32765 ( ibrutinib ) approximately 110 patient chemoimmunotherapy-resistant FL whose disease relapse least 2 prior line therapy , include least 1 rituximab combination chemotherapy regimen . Each patient must resistant disease last therapy ( define progression disease [ PD ] within 12 month last dose chemotherapy CD20 antibody combination chemotherapy regimen ) . The study include follow phase : screening ( 30 day prior first dose study drug ) , treatment ( PD unacceptable toxicity ) , posttreatment follow-up ( death , lose follow , withdrawal consent , study end [ define 2 year last patient enrol ] ) . Patients receive 560 mg PCI-32765 mouth daily 21-day cycle . Treatment continuous ( without interruption ) self-administered home . The treatment phase extend administration first dose study medication PD unacceptable toxicity . If patient radiological evidence PD clinically stable improve exhibit sign tumor flare without confirmation PD PET biopsy , may continue treatment ibrutinib upon request investigator approval sponsor . Posttreatment follow-up extend end treatment death , lose follow , withdrawal consent , study end . Every patient , except explicitly withdraw consent site contact , follow survival status study end . In addition , data subsequent antineoplastic therapy also collect . Serial pharmacokinetic sample collect efficacy safety monitor throughout study . A separate assessment pharmacokinetics plan patient receive strong moderate CYP3A4/5 inhibitor receive treatment ibrutinib . For patient already discontinue ibrutinib due PD , take anticancer therapy , radiologically document delay response , resumption ibrutinib permit case-by-case basis , upon request investigator approval sponsor .</detailed_description>
