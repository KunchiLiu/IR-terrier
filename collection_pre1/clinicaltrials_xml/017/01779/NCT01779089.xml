	<brief_summary>Diabetic kidney disease increase risk illness death heart disease patient Type 2 diabetes . Some blood pressure medication call ACE inhibitor ARBs slow progression kidney disease , dose use often limited side effect experience patient . The limiting side effect current treatment lower kidney function blood pressure , rise blood potassium level . A safe inexpensive medication n't low kidney function blood pressure raise serum potassium would useful . Minocycline tetracycline antibiotic recently appreciate protective property . In publish journal article Dr. Isermann , minocycline prevent death specialize kidney cell mouse . The kidney mouse develop diabetic kidney disease see microscope mouse experience little bit protein loss urine . In different publish paper , author show minocycline also decrease kidney injury model non-diabetic kidney disease . A related tetracycline antibiotic show low urine protein diabetic patient . These data support rationale test see minocycline safe helpful patient diabetic kidney disease . In study , patient stay usual medication treatment diabetic kidney disease . Patients give either minocycline ( 100 mg mouth twice day 24 week ) placebo ( inactive capsule take twice day 24 week ) . Minocycline placebo assign process call `` randomization '' , like coin toss . Neither patient study team know patient take placebo minocycline end study . The study assess minocycline safety test see minocycline helpful helpful treatment diabetic kidney disease . This study fund American Diabetes Association support pharmaceutical company .</brief_summary>
