	<brief_summary>This research study image pilot study . Imaging pilot study explore potential benefit one imaging approach compare another clinically accept approach . Such study serve understand feasible approach may whether worth pursue formal large clinical trial . Researchers study believe simultaneous Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image offer additional imaging information improve cancer detection . MRI PET two test allow u take picture body `` look inside '' body without surgery . The MRI scanner use powerful magnet make picture body . The PET scanner make picture use special dye `` light '' inside body . PET scan use radiation , similar radiation standard x-ray . We routinely use test diagnose various type cancer . As , combination PET compute tomography ( CT ) consider standard care image approach various cancer . Until recently , MRI PET test do separately . Now new type test call MR-PET combine MRI PET test result . This scanner use MRI PET test time . We would like find MR-PET scanner produce good clearer image ( picture ) tumor information inside body . This new MR-PET scanner approve US FDA . However , computer program tell machine acquire combine test result new experimental . Experimental mean computer program approve FDA . This mean use research study . The MR-PET scanner previously use human participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree participate study ask undergo test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include medical history , blood test urine pregnancy test . If test show eligible participate research study , able undergo one time MR/PET image session day schedule PET/CT . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . We verify doctor ordered standard PET/CT scan part regular medical care . You PET/CT scan teh main MGH Boston campus . As part PET/CT scan , injection radioactive material vein . The radioactive material consist glucose ( sugar ) label radioactive . Your doctor , radiologist perform image and/or PET/CT staff explain type scan detail . You ask sign separate consent form PET/CT scan . PET/CT scan make picture structure inside body injected radioactive material `` light '' picture . This show u detail organ , tissue , blood vessel , structure body . The radioactive material break leave body gradually urine . It take day radioactive material exit body completely . You receive additional injection radioactive material MR-PET study . You standard PET/CT procedure study MR-PET scan day . After PET/CT scan , travel MGH Charlestown facility study MR-PET scan . It take 15 minute travel main MGH campus MGH Charlestown facility . Although must fast ( eat drinking ) PET/CT scan , fast MR-PET scan . You able snack scan , wish . During MR-PET Procedure : We ask standard question make sure safely MRI . It important take anything contains metal , jewelry , pierce zipper . You may need put hospital gown . We also ask empty bladder scan . We ask lie narrow table . The table slide center large MRI scanner , shape like tunnel . The tunnel little wider body . You need lie still scan process . In order help hold head still , may place foam pillow around head . The scanner make loud bang beeping noise make picture , give earplug headphone protect ear . The top side tunnel close face body , make people uncomfortable . If ever experience fear small space ( claustrophobia ) , please tell MRI staff . You able hear speak research staff time scan . We stop scan time , need . First , make picture brain and/or whole body . The PET scan take place time MRI scan use new MR-PET scanner . You need another injection radioactive material MR-PET scan . During scan , may ask activity hand , look picture , listen sound , thing . We make picture brain activity test different setting scanner . After study scan complete , time study . The whole testing session take one half hour . You may feel little bit tired afterwards , rest bit leave scan area . You research study one month-this include wait period pathology result surgery back . Your actual participation study involve one day receive PET/CT PET/MR .</detailed_description>
