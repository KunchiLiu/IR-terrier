	<brief_summary>Incubator temperature one precious variable IVF lab . When IVF start , almost incubator temperature set 37 degree mimic vivo condition . Some author speculate gamete early embryo might need low temperature provide quiet metabolism . We decide compare Embryo culture 37 degree slightly low 36.5 degree extensively investigate find well crucially introduce solid evidence RCT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since first IVF birth 1978 , field assist reproductive technology evolve dramatically . The evolution include ovarian stimulation protocol laboratory technique . Optimization laboratory procedure great interest scientist field IVF . Incubator temperature one precious variable IVF lab . When IVF start , almost incubator temperature set 37 degree mimic vivo condition . Some author speculate gamete early embryo might need low temperature provide quiet metabolism . another group find increase pregnancy rate embryo culture 37 degree compare culture 37 degree . Nevertheless ; majority embryologist still consider culture 37 degree back bone incubator . The paucity well design study make difficult achieve satisfactory answer whether low temperature improve pregnancy rate . This encourage u study effect low temperature ( 36.5 degree ) pregnancy rate compare conventional temperature ( 37 degree ) .</detailed_description>
