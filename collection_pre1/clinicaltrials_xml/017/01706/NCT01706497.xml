	<brief_title>Predictive Value FORE-SIGHT™ Monitor Hemodynamic Deterioration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Accurate hemodynamic monitoring often require use invasive tool catheter . Many tool , available adult , use critically ill infant child , size , invasive technique carry high risk complication . Non-invasive monitoring technique allow detect critical hemodynamic state high interest population . FORE-SIGHT™ non-invasive tool measure cerebral tissue oxygen saturation . Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation ( SctO2 ) value important clinician cerebral hypoxia ( lack oxygen supply brain tissue ) one lead cause brain injury occur many surgical clinical situation . The FORE-SIGHT™ Cerebral Oximeter utilize optically-based Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) technology monitor absolute SctO2 . It work project harmless near infra-red light scalp skull brain via disposable sensor patient 's forehead . The device measure light return detector sensor analyzes information utilizing patent algorithms determine absolute cerebral tissue oxygen saturation level . The FORE-SIGHT™ design monitor SctO2 continuous way , provide clinician opportunity intervene damage brain occurs . The monitor currently part standard monitoring child undergo cardiopulmonary bypass , operate theatre , often continue postoperative phase pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) university hospital Leuven . Several study point potential advantage SctO2 monitor peri-operative phase cardiac abdominal surgery adult [ 1,2,3,4 ] , well child undergo surgical correction congenital cardiac defect [ 5,6,7 ] . Low SctO2 value associate bad outcome , correspond data monitor indicate oxygen content brain time insufficient . In particular , duration SctO2 desaturations 55 % , 60 % , 65 % , predictive postoperative complication [ 8 ] . These study , however , analyze use NIRS tool monitor brain time high risk , complex surgery compromise circulation . Although evidence demonstrate decision making base NIRS data favorable patient outcome , many center use NIRS monitoring tool outside surgical environment . Because brain sensitive change oxygenation , monitor SctO2 might provide indication critical change hemodynamic state patient , thus serve monitor general hemodynamic status patient . The present study wish examine add value SctO2 monitoring routine monitoring pediatric patient PICU , postoperative phase cardiac surgery . Ideally , order add value , SctO2 change precede episode hemodynamic deterioration . Prediction heart intensive care medicine , physician make use medical knowledge patient-related data order foresee change patient 's condition , administer appropriate ( preventive ) treatment . An intensive care unit ( ICU ) data-rich environment several information source , admission record , medical history , laboratory analysis sample , medication treatment record , monitor vital signal . A Patient Data Management System ( PDMS ) ( MetaVision® , iMD-Soft® , Boston , MA ) instal ICU start February 2006 . This PDMS software automatically collect integrates data multiple information source . One benefit patient-related data integrate format readily analyze use computational technique general data mining particular . These technique make use information large databases automatically generate model use prediction ( e.g . predict patient 's probability survival ICU ) . In previous study research group show high predictive performance obtain data mining model intensive care domain . In study make use data mining technique assess predictive power SctO2-monitoring future hemodynamic deterioration PICU patient cardiac surgery , analyze data collect PDMS , include FORE-SIGHT™ NIRS . 2 . Aims project • To assess independent predictive power FORE-SIGHT™ NIRS signal future hemodynamic deterioration critically ill infant child , postoperative phase cardiac surgery . • To assess predictive power FORE-SIGHT™ NIRS signal outcome critically ill infant child , postoperative phase cardiac surgery . 3 . Study design Prospective , observational , non-interventional study . All eligible child monitor FORE-SIGHT™ , admission wean mechanical ventilation . Typically , patient admit cardiac surgery PICU university hospital Leuven mechanically ventilate 12 hour two week [ 8 ] . The FORE-SIGHTTM SctO2 signal blind bedside clinician store PDMS system analysis . The first 20 minute data arrival ICU use analysis , since time patient typically stabilize new environment transport , data therefore characteristic ICU stay . Data patient use analysis , build predictive model . A copy PDMS database , removal data refer identity patient , use data analysis . Data mining model , simple logistic regression model , also advance machine learn technique ( model automatically learn computer algorithm , Decision Tree model [ 9 ] , Bayesian Networks , Gaussian Processes , Support Vector Machines , … ) , assess independent predictive power FORE-SIGHT™ signal routinely monitor data . 1 . FORE-SIGHT™ early detection future hemodynamic instability . First , model build assess independent predictive power FORE-SIGHT™ signal detect episodes hemodynamic instability 10 minute advance . Since cardiac output directly measure invasively child , episode evidence indirect sign . If one follow criterion meet , consider episode hemodynamic instability . 1 . Hemodynamic monitoring • Heart Rate &gt; 160 &lt; 90 , least 5 consecutive minute • Systolic Blood Pressure &lt; 55 ( infant ) &lt; 65 ( child ) , least 5 consecutive minute 2 . Point care laboratory analysis • Venous Saturation ( SvO2 ) &lt; 55 ( cyanogenic cardiopathy present ) , &lt; 65 ( patient ) • Lactate &gt; 2 mmol/L arterial blood gas sample 3 . Clinical observation • Urine Output rate &lt; normal rate 0.5 ml/kg/h 2 consecutive hour 2 . FORE-SIGHT™ prediction outcome . Second , model build ass whether FORE-SIGHT™ signal predictive hospital ICU Length Stay ( LOS ) , mortality , duration ( invasive non-invasive ) mechanical ventilator support . In order ass predictive performance 2 predictive task , follow statistic use : positive predictive value , area ROC curve ( AUROC ) , Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic , calibration-in-the-large , calibration-slope Brier score . The positive predictive value proportion positive instance correctly classify . It reflect probability positive result corresponds underlying condition test . The AUROC measure model 's ability discriminate positive negative instance . Usually AUROC evaluation prefer accuracy allows trade possibly different cost incorrectly classify negative instance positive , equivalently tradeoff model 's sensitivity specificity . The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic , calibration-in-the-large calibration-slope use determine whether model well calibrate . These test ass whether observed event rate match expect event rate subgroups population . Models expect observed event rate subgroups similar say well calibrate . Overall model performance assess Brier Score normalized version , Brier Scaled Score . Accurate model low overall prediction error therefore low Brier Score ( base case value task ) . 4 Study population All child young 12 year age , admit PICU Leuven University hospital Leuven cardiac surgery eligible study , meet follow inclusion criterion : - Mechanically ventilate upon ICU admission intubate admission - Arterial line place . - Expected stay least 24h PICU . Patients actual potential brain damage , traumatic brain injury patient , patient brain tumor , patient cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) exclude . Patients condition wound prohibits placement forehead sensor also exclude . The study collect data period 1,5 year . 300 critically ill child recruit . Approximately 20 % PICU patient exhibit clinical deterioration event , median ( IQR ) length stay 3 ( 2-7 ) day [ 8 ] least one event per day , expect minimum 180 event clinical deterioration yearly population . From previous study similar event distribution [ 15,16 ] expect model result sensitivity ( specificity ) least 0.8 , alpha error 5 % statistical power 80 % . The study therefore require statistical power detect potential FORE-SIGHT™ NIRS signal predict clinical deterioration .</detailed_description>
