	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Image Guided Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility correlate change number circulate tumor cell metastatic breast cancer patient time progression follow hypofractionated image guide radiotherapy know site ( = &lt; 5 ) disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival , overall survival , pattern failure , toxicity hypofractionated image guide radiotherapy active site ( = &lt; 5 ) metastatic disease . II . To assess feasibility Interferon-Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature ( IRDS ) predictive value treatment failure , radiation field . OUTLINE : Patients metastases lung , liver , abdomen , extremity undergo 10 fraction less hypofractionated radiation therapy patient brain metastasis undergo single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 week 2 month , 3 month , every 3 month year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
