	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety BRL 49653C Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) common form hyperglycaemic state . Although NIDDM exist population , prevalence varies greatly , depend upon age race , appear increase . It estimate NIDOM occur 5 % 50-year-old-adults 20 % 80-year-old population linear progression age group . Aberrant insulin secretion pancreatic p-cells , insulin resistance peripheral tissue reduce glucose uptake ( particularly muscle liver ) primary pathogenic mechanism believe responsible metabolic abnormality associate NIDDM . Insulin resistance progress overt diabetes rate approximately 5 % patient per year . Patients insulin resistance , overt diabetes mellitus , generally overweight , usually sedentary lifestyle , frequently family history diabetes mellitus . Insulin-resistant phenotype commonly associate cardiovascular risk factor hypertension dyslipidemia ( decreased HDL increase VLDL , LDL triglycerides ) . Current available therapy NIDOM include insulin oral hypoglycemic agent ( e.g . sulphonylurea compound biguanides ) . Sulphonylureas achieve blood glucose control enhance pancreatic insulin secretion . However , significant failure rate exist mode treatment , many patient receive long term treatment sulphonylureas require exogenous insulin therapy longer adequate pancreatic insulin secretion ( even response sulphonylureas ) . Single therapy biguanide , metformin , combination therapy additional sulphonylurea may also administer NIDDM patient . However , overall effect metformin glycemic control seem small sulphonylureas , many case , combination therapy stop need insulin period time . BRL 49653C highly potent orally active anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione compound . The thiazolidinediones BRL 49653C represent novel class compound act `` insulin sensitizer '' target tissue . Unlike sulphonylureas , BRL 49653C improves sensitivity muscle liver insulin . An agent enhances insulin sensitivity may effective regulating elevate blood glucose patient NIDDM theoretically may beneficial reduce frequency severity morbid complication disease . BRL 49653C increase pancreatic insulin secretion ; therefore , treatment BRL 49653C potential exhaust pancreatic function , produce untoward effect hypoglycemia ( potential complication treatment sulphonylureas ) . In animal testing , repeat oral administration BRL 49653C effective reduce hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia , hypertriglyceridemia , free fatty acid associate insulin-resistant model NIDDM2 . In genetically obese mouse , potency BRL49653C anti-hyperglycemic agent , compare competitor insulin sensitizer , BRL 49653C proven least 100 time potent CS-045 ( troglitazone ) least 30 time potent pioglitazone . Six month toxicological finding similar observe one month study . Please refer Investigator Brochure detailed information pre-clinical study pharmacology , metabolism , toxicology BRL 49653C . To date , seven complete Phase I study show BRL 49653C safe well tolerate . The level exposure BRL 49653C show similar fed fast state , pharmacokinetic analysis show evidence accumulation 10 day daily dose 1 5 mg obese volunteer . A total 140 volunteer receive BRL 49653C range dos 0.2 20 mg ( 20 mg dose approximately 4 5-fold high dos expect administered NIDDM patient ) . Of , 140 subject , 91 receive one single dose BRL 49653C 20 mg . This include 10 healthy elderly male ( &gt; = 65 year age ) . Additionally , 49 obese subject receive dosage 5 mg/day 10 consecutive day . SmithKline Beecham Phase I clinical study show BRL 49653C safe well tolerate . The frequently observed adverse experience headache . Serious adverse experience transient asymptomatic accelerate unifocal ventricular rhythm le 10 second duration observe two volunteer . The arrhythmia note 27 minute 2 hour 20 minute administration single dose BRL 49653C 2mg . Hotter monitor perform two study order evaluate arrythmogenicity BRL 49653C . Study 002 , placebo control , 10 day repeat dose , two-period , period balance , cross-over study , within three dose group ( 1 , 2 5 mg ) BRL 49653C . Study 016 single dose , double-blind , randomize ( respect order placebo ) , placebo control , five period cross-over , oral dose rise study subject receive randomly allocate placebo four dos BRL 49653C ( 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 mg ) . In study , evidence protocol- define incidence ventricular tachycardia , ventricular premature beat , supraventricular tachycardia . A recent study another thiazolidinedione compound , troglitazone , show increase cardiac mass cardiac function impairment patient NIDDM . To contrary , patient observe decrease systemic vascular resistance , enhance cardiac output stroke volume . Other study examine thiazolidinediones show beneficial effect Hemoglobin A1c statistically significant decrease indicate beneficial effect glucose homeostasis period time . BRL 49653C also examine combination glyburide ( glibenclamide ) . BRL 49653C administer 2mg bd NIDDM patient receive stable dos glyburide seven day . No change observe either 24 hour glucose insulin profile , suggest combine treatment associate acute pharmacokinetic interaction would likely result acute untoward pharmacodynamics effect . The safety , tolerability efficacy BRL 49653C patient NIDDM examine phase II , double-blind , placebo control dose response study . A total 380 patient receive either placebo , 005mg bid , 0.25mg bid , 1mg bid 2mg bid 12 week . Analysis variance show highly significant ( p &lt; 0.001 ) treatment effect fast blood glucose week 2 onwards , although clear plateau response achieve high dose test . At high dose 2mg bid , statistically significant difference compare placebo , week 12 fasting plasma glucose ( -40.1 mg/dL ) , fructosamine ( -27.1 mmol/L ) insulin ( -16 % ) , significant reduction hemoglobin Alc ( 0.4 % ) . The lower fasting glucose 2mg bid group concomitant 16 % decrease insulin level support hypothesis insulin sensitization mechanism action BRL 49653 . The drug find safe adverse effect vital sign , ECG clinical chemistry . 2D M-Mode echocardiography reveal leave ventricular mass effect , small reduction hemoglobin 14.5 14.3 g/100ml high dose group ) hematocrit ( 42.6 % 41.8 % ) regard clinically significant . Furthermore , BRL 49653C find well tolerate dose range 0.05-2.0mg bid adverse event profile similar placebo qualitatively quantitatively . During study total 18 serious adverse event ( sAE ) report , 9 screening/run-in phase 9 12 week randomization period . There 3 sAE placebo 2.0mg BRL 49653 group I 0.05 , 0.25 1.0mg group . There 2 death study , one case myocardial infarction ( 2.0mg group ) 52 year old male designate possibly relate , case ( 0.25mg group ) , 71 year old male cardiopulmonary arrest , unrelated . All sAE specify investigator unrelated trial medication , apart 1 case exercise induce non-sustained ventricular tachycardia 56 year old male receive placebo . Causal relationship give possibly related case . At least 30 % patient initially treat sulphonylureas NIDDM poor response , remain 70 % subsequent failure rate approximately 4 % 5 % per year .
