	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give bortezomib without combination chemotherapy work consolidation therapy patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma complete stem cell transplant . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , dexamethasone , lenalidomide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give bortezomib effective without combination chemotherapy post transplant setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare stringent complete response ( sCR ) rate 12 cycle among arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free overall survival among arm . II . To describe adverse event profile arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare sCR 6 cycle 24 cycle quality life among arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 15 course 1-12 day 1 course 13-24 . ARM B : Patients receive bortezomib SC Arm A , cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) day 1 15 course 1-12 day 1 course 13-24 , dexamethasone PO day 1 15 course 1-12 day 1 course 13-24 . ARM C : Patients receive bortezomib SC Arm A lenalidomide PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . In arm , treatment continue every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
