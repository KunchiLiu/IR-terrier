	<detailed_description>Longitudinal study subject temporomandibular dysfunction show general pattern symptom diminishment , especially elderly . However study 2-8 year show residual symptom many nearly 25 % unabated symptom . Dextrose injection utilize empirically many year mark reduction pain luxation intra-articular pericapsular dextrose injection report recent RCT . However , small study size lack non injection control prevent definitive conclusion additional efficacy include dextrose injectate . The mechanism action dextrose injection originally think via brief stimulation inflammatory cascade resultant production growth factor . However , non-inflammatory dextrose effect growth factor production demonstrate , , recently , dextrose find treat neurogenic inflammation ( pain upregulation TRPV1 receptor peptidergic nerve ) . This theoretical benefit reduce pain , regardless status position intraarticular cartilage degree degenerative change TMD . The primary goal study evaluate ability dextrose injection versus saline injection reduce pain improve functional complaint referable temporomandibular joint .</detailed_description>
