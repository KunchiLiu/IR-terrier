	<detailed_description>Micronutrient deficiency major health problem many develop country , include Cambodia . Micronutrient deficiency result poor health , much high risk mortality vulnerable group pregnant woman young infant , delay physical cognitive development , result retarded growth stunt . It thereby prevents child reach full potential micronutrient play important role child 's cognitive motor development . The UN World Food Program ( WFP ) provide daily school meal ~500,000 school child Cambodia . The main objective school meal program increase school attendance . Although school meal provide salt fortified iodine , vegetable oil fortify vitamin A , school meal provide excellent opportunity improve micronutrient status school child provide rice fortify vitamin mineral zinc , vitamin A , iron , folic acid vitamin B12 . This likely reduce prevalence anemia school child improve health school performance . Anemia major problem school child Cambodia . A recent study WFP show half school child anemic . Rice fortification show safe effective improve micronutrient status many study . However , study do Latin America , Africa India . There study available Cambodia , except acceptability study fortify rice conduct WFP Institute Research Development ( IRD ) 2010 Kampung Speu . This acceptability study show fortified rice excellent acceptability among school child , parent teacher . However , data available whether fortified rice reduce prevalence anemia school child Cambodia , whether additional benefit , good learning capability school child few day miss due good health . To inform WFP , Cambodian policy public potential benefit fortify rice health development Cambodian school child , intervention study conduct Kampung Speu province 2012 - 2013 school year . The study conduct IRD , PATH WFP . Sixteen ( 16 ) school select receive either normal rice provide WFP school meal program , fortify rice instead normal rice . Three ( 3 ) different type fortify rice test , identify best type fortify rice . In addition , 4 school school meal program select serve control . School attendance morbidity follow child participate school whole school year . Biochemical indicator micronutrient status determine subgroup child ( 25 % child ) , require collection blood , urine stool sample . The study submit Ethical Committee Ministry Health approval , Ethical Review Board PATH , USA . Furthermore , approval obtain Ministries Health , Education Planning prior commencement study . Potential benefit study include immediate treatment school child find severe anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 70 g/L ) improve health cognitive development child receive fortified rice . Potential disadvantage risk study include side effect blood take subgroup child disruption class day data collection . If result study show improved health cognition school child receive fortified rice , provision fortify rice 500,000 Cambodian school child take part WFP school meal program Cambodia could become priority .</detailed_description>
