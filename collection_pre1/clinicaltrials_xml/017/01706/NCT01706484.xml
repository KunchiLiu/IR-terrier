	<detailed_description>The clinical trial population consist patient present two typical symptom CRS duration symptom least ≥12 week . The diagnosis confirm initial diagnosis CRS nasal endoscopy and/or computer tomography ( CT ) obligatory nasal endoscopy include exclusion nasal polyp screen phase . A total 885 patient include clinical trial , last approximately 12 month , include screening , treatment medication-free follow-up period well final reporting . The duration individual patient approximately 22 week ( Visit 1 - Visit 7 ) . After 2-week screening phase , treatment start application either 240 mg 480 mg daily dose ( t.i.d . ) placebo 12 week follow medication-free follow-up period . Symptoms often correlate finding nasal endoscopy CT . Therefore , efficacy clinical trial define per clinical definition use five individual rhinosinusitis symptom ( MSS ) grade investigator use increase severity grading ( 0 = absent [ none / present ] , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe ) . Secondary outcome measure include - single rhinosinusitis symptom CRS ( MSSINV MSSPAT ) , - Work Productivity Activity Impairment patient questionnaire relate General Health [ WPAI : GH ] , - total symptom severity Visual Analogue Scale - response treatment rat investigator patient - 20-Question Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [ SNOT-20 , Germany ] - percentage patient permit concomitant medication treatment CRS - premature termination due exacerbation symptoms - post treatment course CRS - pharmacoeconomic assessment - safety tolerability trial treatment</detailed_description>
