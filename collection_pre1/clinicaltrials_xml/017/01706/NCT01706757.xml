	<brief_summary>The ability walk one fundamental attribute human being . However , advance age ability modify combination physiological pathological aging.These change mainly involve irregularity pitch , reduce length stride , instability decrease walk speed ( Beauchet et al. , 2002 ) . Tinetti , Speecheley , Ginter ( 1988 , Ch Wider , F. Vingerhoets , J Bogousslavsky , 2005 ) show 20-30 % heathly old fall year state one fall , 25 % result injury significant effect 5 % fracture . In addition risk fracture fear fall exists many old people even drop effective ( Recommandation HAS , 2005 ) .In France , 9 000 death people age 65 associated year fall association increase rapidly advance age sex . It therefore important term public health , learn recognize gait disturbance , prevent make adequate assessment reduce risk fall . Tools exist ass risk fall . Some comprehensive time-consuming generally discard favour simpler test ( test Tinetti get go test ) . However , list lack precision , particularly term duration single timer.To overcome bias , innovative technology solution seem good way . In study , investigator use motorize go-cart develop INRIA , entitle ANG ( Assisted Navigation Guide ) , obtain reliable accurate measurement parameter walk speed direction . Thus , investigator set main objective , compare standard evaluation process technology assessment , participant age 65 86 year . And secondary objective : evaluate acceptance use go-cart ANG elderly , develop index walk test feasibility detect weakness knee joint ANG undetected clinic .</brief_summary>
