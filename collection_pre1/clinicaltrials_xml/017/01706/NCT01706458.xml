	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study sipuleucel-T without deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) vaccine therapy treat patient prostate cancer respond previous treatment hormone spread place body . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give sipuleucel-T vaccine work well without DNA vaccine therapy treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
