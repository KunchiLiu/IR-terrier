	<detailed_description>Acne vulgaris extremely common dermatological disease find typically adolescence young adulthood . Acne vulgaris manifest open close comedo ( blackhead whitehead ) , papule , pustule , nodule , cyst face , neck , trunk . Scarring occur , particularly lesion inflame deep , even absence external manipulation ( eg , pick squeeze ) skin . Acne vulgaris treat variety agent select address pathogenic factor assume responsible type degree manifest acne lesion . Monotherapy combination therapy regimens useful . Topical agent generally use first-line therapy include retinoids , antibiotic preparation ( eg , erythromycin clindamycin ) , benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ) , alpha beta hydroxy acid ( eg , glycolic salicylic acid preparation ) , azelaic acid . Systemic therapy initiate patient moderate severe inflammatory acne respond topical therapy . Benzoyl peroxide antimicrobial anti inflammatory property often consider important component acne treatment . Benzoyl peroxide frequently first product adolescent use acne purchase without prescription several different concentration formulation . One main success factor acne therapy user compliance treatment , product cost , availability ease use . Poor compliance may translate decrease efficacy ( either improve symptom well enough improve symptom fast enough ) , tolerability issue adverse effect ( eg , erythema , dryness , peel skin ) , lack understanding instruction use , product cost/availability . Whatever reason , poor compliance translates decrease efficacy increase frustration part user . The current study evaluate compare efficacy tolerability 2 common , over-the-counter , topical benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ) product line subject acne : MAXCLARITY II ( 2.5 % BPO ) Foam Cleanser Foam Treatment ( 0.5 % Salicylic Acid ) Toner Foam compare PROACTIV ( 2.5 % BPO ) Renewing Cleanser Repairing Lotion Revitalizing Toner . This randomize , 2 center , evaluator-blinded , split-face efficacy tolerability study MAXCLARITYII PROACTIV , 2 over-the-counter , topical benzoyl peroxide product line , subject acne . Approximately 40 subject , age 16 29 year , inclusive , mild facial acne vulgaris expect participate study . No 50 % subject site enrol age 20 . An expert grader ( blinded evaluator ) complete count inflame lesion ( papules/pustules ) noninflamed lesion ( open/closed comedo ) , Investigator 's Static Global Assessment ( ISGA ) , assessment tolerability side face study visit . Subjects assess tolerability side face study visit complete product acceptability preference questionnaire end study . The study duration 8 week ( 56 day ) visit baseline ( day 1 ) , week 1m week 2 , week 4 week 8 .
