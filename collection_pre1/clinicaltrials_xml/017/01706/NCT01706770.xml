Be good general health , base his/her knowledge . Require spectacle lens power 1.00 6.00 diopter sphere 2.00 diopter refractive astigmatism willing wear contact lenses eye . Have : manifest refraction Snellen visual acuity ( VA ) equal good 20/25 eye . Upon complete fit process lens wear study , contact lens Snellen VA equal well 20/30 eye . Subjects may enrol study follow apply : The subject is/has : Wearing lens monovision modality unwilling fit distance lenses eye . NOTE : Subjects may wear lens monovision modality time study interfere visual acuity analysis . Poor personal hygiene . Any active participation another clinical trial within 30 day prior study . Currently pregnant ( best subject 's knowledge ) , lactate planning pregnancy within study period . A member , relative household member investigator investigational office staff .
