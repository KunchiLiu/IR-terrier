	<brief_summary>This randomize , placebo-controlled , single blind study investigate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile GSK2140944 follow repeat oral dose healthy adult subject . The study include Screening period ( 40 day ) , Treatment period ( 16 day ) Follow-up period ( 26 30 day ) . A single dose administer Day 1 characterization single dose PK , follow twice-daily ( BID ) thrice-daily ( TID ) dose Days 3 16 . Subjects may randomize one cohort per randomization schedule . Up 6 cohort enrol use sequential panel . Subjects Cohort 1 receive GSK2140944 ( 6 ) placebo ( 2 ) . Subsequent cohort enroll 16 subject 12 subject receive GSK2140944 4 subject receive placebo , per dose level accord randomization schedule . Dose escalation plan run successive week . Cohort 2 may begin dose subject Cohort 1 complete 7 day BID dosing , PK data review safety data least 6 subject available . Each subsequent dose escalation commence GSK2140944 safety data available PK data least 12 subject dose previous dose level review . The number cohort may reduce expand need . The first plan dose 400 milligram ( mg ) BID may modify base upon emergent PK , safety tolerability data ongoing clinical study BTZ115198 evaluate single repeat intravenous ( IV ) dose GSK2140944 . The project dose Cohort 2 800 mg BID , Cohort 3 1500 mg BID , Cohort 4 2300 mg BID 1500 mg TID Cohort 5 cohort 6 decide later . The planned maximum dose 2500 mg TID may modify base upon emergent safety , tolerability PK data . Doses GSK2140944 placebo administer follow moderate fat meal .</brief_summary>
