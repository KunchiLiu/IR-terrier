	<brief_summary>End stage renal failure ( ESRF ) describe irreversible loss renal function . The majority patient opt haemodialysis ( HD ) choose method renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . Arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) optimal method achieve vascular access permit HD . AVF create small surgical procdure join artery vein together . Over next 6- 8weeks surgery AVF grow ( `` mature '' ) vessel suitable needle insert dialysis . Unfortunately however , around 24 % - 35 % AVF fail early stage . Some anaesthetic technique influence intraoperative blood flow venous diameter , factor associate fistula success . There remain conclusive evidence particular anaesthetic technique significantly influence long term surgical outcome . This study aim investigate whether regional , compare local , anaesthetic technique affect fistula patency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) describe abnormal kidney structure function significant public health problem . It common , increasingly prevalent age often co-exists significant morbidity , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , cerebrovascular disease coronary artery disease . Patients diagnosis CKD decrease life expectancy compare individual without diagnosis . This primarily due cardiovascular disease , complication CKD include bone mineral disorder , anaemia , depression , malnutrition . Early recognition treatment complication recommend . In proportion patient , CKD progress end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . This define irreversible decline kidney function renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) require patient survive . In one UK study , 4 % patient CKD progress develop ESRD require RRT five half year follow period . The decision commence RRT take account symptom biochemical disturbance , conjunction risk inconvenience start RRT . European Best Practice Guidelines recommend RRT commence estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) fall 15ml/min/1.73m2 symptom uraemia , fluid overload malnutrition resistant medical therapy . In asymptomatic patient , eGFR 6ml/min/1.73m2 would also prompt initiation dialysis . It known life expectancy patient receive RRT short general population varies dependent underlie diagnosis age . For example , median survival patient Scotland age 45 - 64 year start RRT glomerulonephritis 7.7 year , whereas median survival patient age group diagnosis diabetic nephropathy 2.9 year . The life expectancy male age group within general Scottish population 24.2 year . Instituting RRT prolongs life reduces incidence vasculo-occlusive event patient ESRD . As , patient CKD monitor nephrologist order timely referral preparation RRT make . Renal replacement therapy may come form haemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis renal transplantation , may manage hospital . Haemodialysis ( HD ) remain common modality first RRT Scotland ; 2885 patient commence RRT period 2005-2009 , 2264 receive HD . In order undergo HD , must connection patient 's vascular system dialysis machine . The common method surgical creation arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) , needle insert turn connect dialysis machine . In 2009 , 75 % Scottish patient undergo HD underwent formation arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) . Other option vascular access include arteriovenous graft use synthetic material long-term central venous catheter , though associate high rate occlusive infective complication . AVF currently regard optimal form vascular access HD recommend National guideline . There excellent evidence good quality , stable vascular access major factor determine survival group CKD patient . Unfortunately however , around 24 % - 35 % arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) fail early stage . Some anaesthetic technique influence intraoperative blood flow venous diameter , factor associate fistula success . There remain conclusive evidence particular anaesthetic technique significantly influence long term surgical outcome . This study aim investigate whether regional , compare local , anaesthetic technique affect fistula patency .</detailed_description>
