	<brief_summary>This Clinical Trial conduct study two adjunctive treatment rotator cuff repair ; soft tissue bone trephination . `` Trephination '' procedure involve make small perforation either torn tendon near edge , bone tendon repair . The rotator cuff repair sew tendon bone shoulder . Trephination new technique use addition standard method repair rotator cuff tendon . This study help determine whether technique improves speed heal , strength re-tear rate repair . You ask take part study tear rotator cuff require surgical treatment . A total 90 participant participate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients fail standard nonsurgical management rotator cuff tear , would benefit surgical repair cuff . Failed medical management define persistent pain disability despite adequate standard nonoperative management 6 month . Medical management define : The use drug include analgesic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug Physiotherapy consist stretching , strengthen local modality ( ultrasound , cryotherapy , etc ) Activity modification Imaging , intraoperative finding confirm full thickness tear rotator cuff . 1 . Characteristics cuff tear render cuff irrepairable : fatty infiltration muscle grade III ( 50 % ) great ; superior subluxation humeral head ; retraction cuff level glenoid rim . 2 . Partial thickness cuff tear . 3 . Significant shoulder comorbidities e.g . Bankart lesion , osteoarthritis 4 . Previous surgery affect shoulder e.g . Previous rotator cuff repair . 5 . Patients active worker 's compensation claim 6 . Active joint systemic infection 7 . Significant muscle paralysis 8 . Rotator cuff tear arthropathy 9 . Charcot 's arthropathy 10 . Significant medical comorbidity could alter effectiveness surgical intervention ( eg . Cervical radiculopathy , polymyalgia rheumatica ) 11 . Major medical illness ( life expectancy le 1 year unacceptably high operative risk ) 12 . Unable speak read English/French 13 . Psychiatric illness precludes inform consent 14 . Unwilling follow 1 year 15 . Advanced physiologic age</criteria>
