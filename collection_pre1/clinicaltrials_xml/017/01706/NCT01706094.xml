	<detailed_description>Background : Several line investigation indicate potential beneficial effect intervention augment cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) irrigate ischemic penumbra acute ischemic stroke . The simple manner place patient 'lying flat ' rather upright head position . However , potential benefit brain may offset increase hazard aspiration pneumonia exacerbation cardiac failure vulnerable patient . Given uncertainty balance potential modest benefit risk , variability regard ideal head position policy patient acute ischemic stroke around world , reliable randomize evidence require standardize clinical practice . Aims : The main objective pilot phase clinical trial determine feasibility , safety potential efficacy large-scale cluster randomize clinical trial ass whether simple nursing care policy - 'lying flat head position ' - provide beneficial effect compare standard upright head position patient acute ischemic stroke . The main efficacy outcome pilot phase demonstration increase mean cerebral blood flow velocity ( CBFV ) lie flat head position compare upright head position , assessed transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) medial cerebral artery patient anterior circulation infarction . Secondary efficacy objective demonstrate lie flat head position improve neurological status 7 day disability 90 day . Methods : Inclusion criterion include consecutive adult patient acute ischemic stroke within 12 hour onset admit participate center . A cluster ( month ) method randomization lie flat upright head position 48 hour , stratify site The primary outcome change mean CBFV measure TCD 24 hour . Secondary outcome include proportion adverse event 7 day , distribution NIHSS 7 day , distribution mRS disability scale score 90 day . Sample size 46 cluster 2 patient total approximately 92 patient detect increase 8.31 ( CI 95 % 4.82-12.0 ) cm/sec average CBFV 30° 0° head position . This sample size also allow detection difference 90 % power 5 % significance level , consider ICC 0.037 .</detailed_description>
