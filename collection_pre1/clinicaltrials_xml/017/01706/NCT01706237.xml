	<brief_title>Visual Outcomes And Contrast Sensitivity After Myopic Wavefront-Optimized Lasik With Nexisvision Shield Or Bandage Contact Lens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laser situ keratomileusis ( LASIK ) surgery perform worldwide since 1990 . Historically , LASIK report decrease contrast sensitivity post operatively patient advise take day work potentially day LASIK . More recently , utilize advance laser technology optimize corneal ablation creation flap potential improve LASIK surgery result improve recovery time . Visual recovery management immediate post operative visual acuity important patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
