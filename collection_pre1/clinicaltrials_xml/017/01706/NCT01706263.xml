	<brief_title>U0289-402 : An Open Label , 8 Week Study Evaluate Efficacy Tolerability MAXCLARITY II Subjects With Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne vulgaris extremely common dermatological disease find typically adolescence young adulthood . Acne vulgaris manifest open close comedo ( blackhead whitehead ) , papule , pustule , nodule , cyst face , neck , trunk .

Whatever reason , poor compliance translates decrease efficacy increase frustration part user . The current study evaluate efficacy tolerability MAXCLARITY II , counter , topical benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ) product line , subject acne . This multi center , open label study evaluate efficacy tolerability MAXCLARITY II , the-counter , topical benzoyl peroxide product line , subject acne . Approximately 30 subject , age 16 29 year , inclusive , mild facial acne vulgaris expect participate study . No 50 % subject site enrol age 20 . An expert grader complete count inflame lesion ( papules/pustules ) noninflamed lesion ( open/closed comedo ) , ISGA , assessment tolerability study visit . Subjects assess tolerability study visit complete product acceptability preference questionnaire end study . The study duration 8 week ( 56 day ) visit baseline ( day 1 ) , week 1 , week 2 , week 4 week 8 .</detailed_description>
