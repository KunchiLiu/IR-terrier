	<brief_title>The Quarterback Trial : Reduced Dose Radiotherapy HPV+ Oropharynx Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized Phase III study compare two dos definitive radiation therapy give induction concurrent chemotherapy HPV-positive oropharynx , unknown primary nasopharynx cancer . Eligible , consent register patient receive three cycle Docetaxel Cisplatin 5-FU ( TPF ) induction chemotherapy . After 3 cycle , patient assess clinical , radiographic pathologic response TPF . Patients clinical radiographic CR PR randomize second phase study , patient undergo 2:1 randomization reduce ( 5600 cGy ) standard ( 7000 cGy ) dose radiotherapy weekly Carboplatin . Patients meet response criterion treat standard dose CRT . Patients complete 3 cycle TPF reason toxicity , progressive disease , choice , medical necessity treat standard dose CRT surgery depend primary site overall medical condition follow survival . Toxicity assess Symptom score , QOL SAE monitoring . The primary end point trial equivalent local regional control PFS 3 year . Patients follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
