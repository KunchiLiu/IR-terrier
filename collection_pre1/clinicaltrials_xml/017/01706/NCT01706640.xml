	<detailed_description>Objectives : - Assessing current practice pattern best practice share usage Coseal per IFU collect data oSealing suture line along arterial venous reconstruction oPatients undergo cardiac surgery prevent reduce incidence , severity extent post surgical adhesion enforcement suture staple line lung resection procedure - From data document generate real life experience use Coseal cardio vascular thoracic surgery - To possibly create guideline usage Sealant routine practice India - To study delivery method clinical impact minimally invasive surgery like VATS robotic surgery End point Primary Endpoint 1 . Cardio vascular sealing : To report effectiveness safety COSEAL control anastomotic suture line needle hole suture bleed vascular reconstruction check incidence immediate anastomotic seal presence persistent intra-operative postoperative bleeding average time achieve hemostasis single bleeding site 60 clamp without manual compression In case sternotomy , Hemostasis time mn , operative time comprise removal cardio-pulmonary bypass cannulae closure sternum . Overall postoperative bleeding mL/mÂ² revision bleed Minor complication , major complication , mortality 2 . Efficacy Coseal prevention reduction adhesion re-do surgery patient stag operation congenital cardiac malformation re-operated follow-up period registry Incidence adhesion . location extension adhesion measure percentage surface affect following region : pericardial retrosternal , inferior diaphragmatic region , right lateral atrial region , region around great vessel , pulmonary surface . Overall evaluation ( dissection easy difficult ) Incidence subject free adhesion . Severity ( site , adhesion grade follow : absence adhesion ; 1 : filmy avascular ; 2 : dense and/or vascular ; 3 : cohesive ) 3 . Air leak : incidence immediate ( time closure ) prolong post-operative air leak , Use redo surgery air leak . Secondary Endpoints 1 . Cardiovascular ( seal adhesion prevention ) : 1 .
