	<brief_summary>Background : The importance ischemic ECG change include St segment elevation , ST segment depression T wave inversion indicate myocardial ischemia well establish require appropriate investigation treatment . However , abundance clinical situation , apparently ischemic ECG change indicate traditionally coronary artery relate ischemia therefore require prompt recognition treatment underlie condition , may serious life-threatened . For example condition pericarditis , myocarditis , aortic dissection , electrolyte abnormality , intracranial hemorrhage hypothermia . Together , ECG ST segment change may appear abdominal serious illness pancreatitis cholecystitis ( 17,18,19,20,23 ) . Whereas pancreatitis various vasoactive toxic myocardium substance release , cause ST segment change cholecystitis discuss include tachycardia , vagal reflex , change plasma rennin activity result distension gallbladder . The certain proportion patient ECG change actually n't coronary artery disease ( 9,15 ) acute cardiac condition therefore require treatment underlie illness without spend time cardiac investigation special treatment ( 1,3,4,7,8 ) . Some kind treatment may even harmful patient abdominal illness thrombolytic , anticoagulant , aggressive antiaggregant therapy unnecessary cardiac catheterization . In medical literature investigator find case report work ECG change acute biliary disease patient know cardiac disease without , actually incidence ECG change suggest represent acute coronary illness n't know . Therefore necessary investigate actually incidence ECG change mimic acute coronary syndrome acute cholecystitis acute biliary disease determine clinical laboratory characteristic help differentiate patient .</brief_summary>
