	<brief_summary>This Phase IIIb multicentre , randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , 12-week parallel group study evaluate effect daily morning treatment FF/VI Inhalation Powder versus Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Inhalation Powder twice daily lung function COPD subject . Subjects screen enter 2-week , single-blind ( placebo ) , Run-In Period evaluate subject 's adherence study treatment , study procedure assessment disease stability . At end Run-In Period , subject return Clinic meet Randomization Criteria randomize double-blind study medication ( 12-week treatment period ) . Subjects randomize receive either FF/VI 100/25 via NDPI Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol 250/50mcg via ACCUHALER/DISKUS . Matching placebo available NDPI ACCUHALER/DISKUS . Each morning ( approximately 6-10 AM ) subject take 1 inhalation NDPI follow 1 inhalation ACCUHALER/DISKUS . Each evening ( approximately 6-10 PM ) , approximately 12 hour morning dose blind study medication , subject take 1 inhalation ACCUHALER/DISKUS . Subjects return clinic end treatment period . A follow-up phone contact perform approximately 7 day last clinic visit . The overall study duration ( Screening Follow-up ) subject approximately 15 week .</brief_summary>
