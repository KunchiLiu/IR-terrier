	<brief_summary>This study involve subject advanced urothelial cancer platinum refractory ( platinum base chemotherapy effective treat cancer ) , over-expressing EGFR and/or HER2 , over-express EGFR HER2 . Genetic expression process take inherit information gene ( like DNA sequence ) , information make specific functional product ( sometimes call gene product ) RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) protein . Normal tissue cell particular genetic expression , change turn cancer . EGFR HER2 involve process normal cell transform cancer cell . The main purpose study look proportion subject , over-express EGFR and/or HER2 , progress ( cancer get bad ) 16 week study treatment daily lapatinib weekly paclitaxel . The study also look safety effectiveness therapy subject . Another part study look blood tissue sample . Blood sample collect see many cell express EGFR HER2 study treatment time cancer get bad . Tumor tissue analyze look expression certain gene advance urothelial cancer . Some gene expression test reveal cancer cell different normal cell result might lead accurate diagnosis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer cause 14,680 death 2010 US . In advanced bladder cancer , MVAC ( methotrexate , vinblastine , adriamycin cisplatin ) GC ( gemcitabine , cisplatin ) combination chemotherapy demonstrate comparable efficacy response rate 45 % - 50 % . Despite reasonable initial response platinum base chemotherapy , median time progression first line therapy 7 month median survival approximately 15 month . There standard second line therapy platinum base chemotherapy US survival benefit note agent . Median progression free survival ( PFS ) around 2 month platinum refractory urothelial cancer ( PRUC ) overall survival ( OS ) 6 - 8 month single agent second line therapy . Combination chemotherapy prolong overall survival . Given dire prognosis PRUC lack efficacy conventional chemotherapy , preclinical investigation clinical research focus identification novel molecular target . Lapatnib approve FDA treatment breast cancer . Paclitaxel approve FDA treatment sarcoma , breast lung cancer . Lapatinib paclitaxel approve advanced urothelial cancer ; however , FDA allow use drug study research purpose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient must least 18 year age . Diagnosis urothelial carcinoma locally advance , recurrent metastatic require . Patients must progress prior regimen ( 12 allow ) systemic chemotherapy stage urothelial carcinoma ( include perioperative chemotherapy alone case must progress within 12 month perioperative chemotherapy ) , one regimens include platinum agent . Patients must adequate tumor tissue ( primary metastatic tumor ; fresh archive ) available EGFR HER2 expression analysis baseline determine study pathologist . EGFR HER2 status Immunohistochemistry potential patient 's urothelial tumor must determine baseline registration therapy . A potential patient 's eligibility depend his/her tumor 's EGFR HER2 category AND available open slot category time . Patients must able care must 50 % waking hour . Patients must measurable disease . Prior chemotherapy radiation therapy must complete prior registration ( least 4 week prior chemotherapy least 2 week prior radiation ) . Patients must recover reversible side effect must 25 % bone marrow irradiate . Ability heart pump blood must adequate study . This determine screening test . Patients must adequate organ marrow function determine screen test . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign informed consent document .
