	<brief_summary>This study examine whether measurement pelvic floor muscle sEMG activity responsive explicit sexual stimulus , whether correlate self-reports sexual arousal healthy woman . Participants ' vaginal , labial anal sEMG reading monitor exposure neutral , erotic anxiety-provoking film . Participants also require provide subjective rating sexual arousal film . If pelvic floor sEMG validate psychophysiological measure , finding may important clinical research implication provide great understanding mechanism involve sexual arousal provide relatively easy method assess sexual arousal clinical research setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES : 1 . Investigators hypothesize , relative neutral film , PFM EMG activity significantly increase response erotic film measure labial , anal , vaginal EMG probe . 2 . Investigators hypothesize , relative anxiety-provoking film , PFM EMG activity significantly increase response erotic film measure labial , anal , vaginal EMG probe . 3 . Investigators hypothesize continuously measure subjective sexual arousal ( via arousometer ) correlate significantly PFM EMG activity erotic film .</detailed_description>
