	<brief_summary>This study aim test hypothesis potentially important diabetes management , practical implication reduce medical , personal , economic cost disease . Anticipated outcome include reduction glycosylated hemoglobin significantly great achievable current diet recommendation , reduction medication use among many intervention-group participant , beneficial change body weight serum lipid concentration , demonstration acceptability intervention diet . Progress toward goal could refine dietary guidance individual diabetes , increase treatment expectation , reduce massive burden disease currently impose . The study attempt translate dietary intervention study clinical research set medical practice . This contribute develop model diabetes care use widely .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 test hypothesis nutrition intervention ( low-fat , low-GI , vegan diet ; henceforth call 'vegan diet ' ) improve glycemic control , body weight , plasma lipid concentration , blood pressure , indices renal function within-group analysis . Glycosylated hemoglobin primary dependent variable , well fast plasma glucose urinary albumin creatinine concentration . The within-group change variable baseline week 20 , one-year follow-up compare . Specific Aim 2 test hypothesis vegan diet effective standard nutrition care improve glycemic control , body weight , plasma lipid concentration , blood pressure , indices renal function individual type 2 diabetes . Glycosylated hemoglobin primary dependent variable , well fast plasma glucose urinary albumin creatinine concentration intervention control group . The between-groups difference change variable baseline week 20 , one-year follow-up compare . Specific Aim 3 test hypothesis vegan diet sustainable among individual type 2 diabetes 20-week period , weekly class , follow-up period one year limit professional support . This assessed 3-day dietary record week 0 , 20 one-year follow-up . Specific Aim 4 test hypothesis vegan diet acceptability comparable standard nutrition care among individual type 2 diabetes . This hypothesis address quantitatively assess adherence acceptability intervention control diet , use 3-day dietary record , Food Acceptability Questionnaire , Eating Inventory , described . Specific Aim 5 test hypothesis effect dietary intervention A1c body weight reduced individual A1 B1 alleles DRD2 gene . This assessed Taq1 A1 B1 genotype determination baseline .</detailed_description>
