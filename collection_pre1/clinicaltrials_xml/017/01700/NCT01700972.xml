	<brief_summary>The current protocol myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) entail image within 30-45 minute radiotracer injection , rest stress study . We hypothesize early imaging 10 minute radiotracer injection provide high image quality diagnostic accuracy comparable 30-45 minute MPI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current MPI protocol entail image within 30-45 minute radiotracer injection ( W30 image ) , rest stress part . This delay radiotracer injection image intend limit nonspecific liver gut radioactivity heart allow optimal image heart . A recent publication however indicate early imaging within 10 minute radiotracer injection ( W10 image ) appear feasible may good W30 image . Encouraged recent data , think wait time 10 minute feasible preserve image quality ; thus , would like assess feasibility accuracy W10 imaging compare W30 image study . The main purpose study obtain image information use early imaging ( W10 ) . The feasibility W10 imaging assess visually use 3-point scale well semiquantitatively use region-of-interest measurement . The accuracy W10 imaging determine compare finding W10 coronary angiography , obtain within 30 day MPI serve reference standard . The tolerability W10 assess use 3-point scale Questionnaires . This study determine early MPI imaging within 10 minute works well image 30-45 minute wait role diagnosis coronary artery disease . The major advantage new imaging procedure include shorten procedure time , reduction patient discomfort improvement patient care .</detailed_description>
