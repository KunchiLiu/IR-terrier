	<brief_summary>It possible test sample breath patient , run machine , find certain disease patient without need Xrays . It sort like '' breathalyser '' .In future hop type testing common , allow certain condition pick early . One condition Cancer Larynx ( voice box ) . It wide use yet however study show effective detecting Larynx cancer . This breath test detect cancer stage CAN see Xrays look camera . However large cancer ultimately bad patient . It would therefore much good breath test find patient cancer much small size . It interest cancer breath test HAVE find breath test signal , regardless size . This mean even small cancer may signal . These small cancer 1-2 mm thick , find size almost cure . We want find group patient early cancer compare breath test result patient large obvious cancer . These patient compare patient negative larynx cancer also breath test . We want prove breath test negative . You refer either symptom ( cough hoarse voice ) need scope look airway , OR specialist identify spot larynx need biopsy ( sample ) possible treatment , The spot may may cancer- biopsy need . After correct treatment would consider depend result , , whether cancer . If possible would like take test breath biopsy . Alternatively take breath test 2 week biopsy . In summary study try show whether breath test patient large cancer patient small cancer invisible XRay find careful magnification scope look . If show finding demonstrate great potential breath test find many cancer truly curable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Worldwide 130 000 new larnx cancer diagnose annually result 82 000 death [ 1 ] .Survival diagnosis larynx cancer depend initial stage . For T3N0Mo laryngeal cancer 5-year survival range 59 66 % . Patients survival follow : receiving either chemoradiation ( 59.2 % ) , irradiation alone ( 42.7 % ) , patient surgery irradiation ( 65.2 % ) surgery alone ( 63.3 % ) [ 2 ] By contrast early stage larynx cancer survival range 90-100 % . Tamura et al report therapeutic outcome 130 case laryngeal cancer treat Kyoto University Hospital 1995 2004 [ 3 ] In , 121 male 9 female involve . Their age range 40 year 92 year ( average 66 year ) . All tumor squamous cell carcinoma - arise glottis 111 case , supraglottis 18 , subglottis 1 case . Most glottic cancer ( 77.5 % ) classify stage I II , supraglottic cancer ( 77.8 % ) stage III IV . Stage I/II cancer basically treat conventional radiotherapy ( 60-66 Gy ) twice-daily hyperfractionated radiotherapy ( 70-74 Gy ) , respectively , attempt preserve larynx . Total laryngectomy neck dissection perform treatment stage III/IV case . Five-year disease-specific survival rate 100 % , 96 % , 100 % , 68 % stage I , II , III , IV , respectively . Five-year laryngeal preservation rate 98 % , 100 % , 86 % , 0 % , 0 % T1a , T1b , T2 , T3 , T4 glottic cancer , respectively . Local recurrence occur five case stage I/II glottic cancer , successfully salvage . Chera et al [ 4 ] report excellent treatment outcome definitive radiotherapy ( RT ) early-stage squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCA ) glottic larynx . The median follow-up survivor 12 year . Five-year Local Control rate follow : T1A , 94 % ; T1B , 93 % ; T2A , 80 % ; T2B , 70 % . Multivariate analysis reveal overall treatment time great 41 day ( p = 0.001 ) poorly differentiate histology ( p = 0.016 ) adversely affected LC . Five-year rate ultimate LC laryngeal preservation : T1A , 95 % ; T1B , 94 % , T2A , 81 % ; T2B , 74 % . Overall therefore high cure rate . Endoscopic laser resection also excellent outcome early stage larynx cancer . Schrivers et al [ 5 ] report survival analysis 100 patient T1a glottic carcinoma treat CO ( 2 ) laser surgery ( n = 49 ) radiotherapy ( n = 51 ) . No significant difference local control overall survival find . Ultimate 5-year laryngeal preservation significantly well CO ( 2 ) laser surgery group ( 95 % vs 77 % , p = .043 ) . Patients T1a glottic carcinoma normal/diminished mucosal wave treat CO ( 2 ) laser surgery significantly well laryngeal preservation rate patient treat radiotherapy . Staging The larynx divide three anatomic region : 1 . Supraglottis ( suprahyoid epiglottis , infrahyoid epiglottis , aryepiglottic fold ( laryngeal aspect ) , arytenoid , ventricular band ( false cord ) ) 2 , Glottis ( true vocal cord , include anterior posterior commissure ) 3 . Subglottis ( subglottis , extend low boundary glottis lower margin cricoid cartilage ) Volatile organic compound ( VOC ) breath test cancer detection The concept VOC test VOCs , mostly alkanes aromatic compound , preferentially produce exhaled cancer patient use accurate marker malignancy [ 14,15 ] . As early 1971 , test normal breath identify 100 volatile organic compound [ 15 ] In 1980s Gordon Preti use mass spectroscopy gas chromatography identify specific alteration profile volatile organic compound breath lung cancer patient [ 16 ] . In two paper 1999 2003 , Phillips refine original data identify group 9 volatile organic compound highly sensitive specific presence lung cancer [ 13,17 ] . The concentration alkane methylalkane oxidative stress product reduce breath lung cancer patient . The mechanism alteration breath volatile compound profile lung cancer unknown . One hypothesis lung cancer patient accelerate clearance VOCs generate oxidative stress , due heighten production cytochrome p450 result exposure tobacco smoke component genetically predispose individual . Whatever mechanism , potential VOC breath test early case find warrant investigation . The detection VOCs breath purpose diagnosis long history . Ancient Greek physician already know aroma human breath could provide clue diagnosis . The astute clinician alert sweet , fruity odor acetone patient uncontrolled diabetes ; musty , fishy reek advance liver disease ; urine-like smell accompanies fail kidney ; putrid stench lung abscess . Modern breath analysis start 1970s researcher , use gas chromatography ( GC ) , identify 200 component human breath . In term study method , breath test focus cross-sectional longitudinal study [ 18,19 ] . Cross-sectional study investigate exhale biomarkers function disease , biomarkers disease state predictive marker . In cross-sectional study , control group compare patient diseased group , breath marker analyze identify qualitative quantitative difference two group . The difference establish way large enough enable clinically relevant predictive use breath marker Oxidative stress condition cell damage result chemical reaction oxidative agent oxygen-derived free radical . Free radical damage component cell membrane , protein , genetic material `` oxidizing '' themâ€”the chemical reaction cause iron rust . Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , superoxide anion ( O2- ) hydroxyl radical ( OH- ) , act physiologically defense mechanism microbial attack [ 20,21 ] . Under healthy condition , ROS activity restrict limited region external attack inflammation well balance antioxidant protection body . However , diseased state , balance ROS activity protection may impair antioxidant system overwhelm exhausted [ 18 ] . Whenever ROS activity take place uncontrolled manner , organism damage oxidative stress . Phillips coworkers [ 14 ] investigate alveolar gradient ( i.e. , abundance breath minus abundance room air ) C4 C20 alkane monomethylated alkane breath tumor marker primary lung cancer . They conclude breath test C4 C20 alkane monomethylated alkane provide rational new set marker identify lung cancer group patient histologically confirm disease . The analytical methodology describe 2003 [ 17 ] , report amongst smoker ex-smokers sensitivity malignancy 86 % ( 55/64 ) specificity 83 % ( 19/23 ) . This compare sensitivity specificity non smoker 66 % ( 2/3 ) 78 % ( 14/18 ) . Overall therefore VOC breath test affect smoking status . Changes breath VOC pattern independent size lung cancer T1 tumour ( &lt; 3cm ) similar breath pattern abnormality T4 tumours [ 22 ] , raise possibility VOC abnormality may even detectable preneoplastic ( severe dysplasia carcinoma situ ) stage . It describe comparison 212 control without lung cancer 195 patient primary lung cancer . The breath test likely abnormal stage 1 disease stage 4 disease . This imply firstly screen tool VOC breath test potential detect operative curable case . Secondly , implies oxidative change lead altered breath VOCs early feature lung cancer development , method may therefore detect presence preneoplastic lesion bronchial tree . The strength VOC breath test simplicity methodology specimen collection . Patients breathe portable collection apparatus tube 5 minute . This require tidal breathe therefore present difficulty even patient pulmonary disease . In 2006 review Lam Shaipanich [ 23 ] look forward possible role breath test tool : `` For example use biomarker sensitivity 85 % specificity 81 % , ( breath testing- insert ) disease prevalence 2.7 % , instead screen every person cohort spiral CT fluorescence bronchoscopy , 21 % cohort need CT fluorescence bronchoscopy . '' Breath test Laryngeal cancer In recent article Hakim et al [ 24 ] describe first time Head Neck cancer identify breath test . Alveolar breath collect 87 volunteer ( HNC LC patient healthy control ) cross-sectional clinical trial . The discriminative power tailor-made Nanoscale Artificial Nose ( NA-NOSE ) base array five gold nanoparticle sensor test , use 62 breath sample . The NA-NOSE signal analyse detect statistically significant difference sub-populations use ( ) principal component analysis ANOVA Student 's t-test ( ii ) support vector machine cross-validation . The result show breath test could clearly distinguish ( ) HNC patient healthy control , ( ii ) LC patient healthy control , ( iii ) HNC LC patient . The GC-MS analysis show statistically significant difference chemical composition breath three group . The Cyranose / Enose VOC test eNose allows group patient test difference similarity breath signal [ 25-27 ] . A single expire breath collect sample bag pump draw sample device pass 32 electronic sensor . Over 400 possible chemical affect sensor different way , ad pattern electronic signal generate . It distribution electric signal across 32 sensor give pattern . Software within device determines 32 sensor give strong signal test , use sensor result combination result call factor . This know Principal Component analysis . When compare 3 group patient software generate 2 factor breath sample plot graph . Where group patient distinctive signal factor analysis clump group together , certain `` distance '' graph group . The great distance ( Mahalobinus distance ) different group . Numerous author publish data type analysis variety disease state , particularly lung cancer . This approach easy technically lead study individual VOCs responsible signal . It likely however base result tumours combination VOCs present different amount cancer patient oppose single VOC . The ENose approach apply Head Neck cancer patient report detection situ cancer . Because step wise development squamous cell cancer quite possible In situ case would clump together advanced case Squamous cell carcinoma , would different smoking control . Alternatively may signal early case different later stage different control well , early advanced case could diagnose breath test . It known CT VOC breath test detect stage 1 cancer lung least 50 % cure rate [ 17 ] . There potential however VOC detect even early stage lung cancer , in-situ-carcinoma properly stag treat 95 % long term cure rate [ 24 ] . The goal screen study find cancer curable stage . VOC breath test combine fluorescence/NBI bronchoscopy CT could perhaps achieve desired goal . It possible VOC test ultimately use larynx cancer screen either first step ( high negative predictive value ) second line test evaluate equivocal result screen low dose CT chest . Also , expertise NBI fluorescence bronchoscopy focus management type early lesion find approach . Summary background : Detecting Laryngeal cancer in-situ T1 stage allow ablative treatment ( Transoral Laryngeal surgery Radiotherapy ) excellent long term outcome . Smoking main risk factor , whilst early Laryngeal cancer patient symptoms many . The possibility screen heavy smoker would useful particularly detected cancer pre-clinical stage . Breath test show detect range cancer include lung breast cancer , detect signature pattern exhale volatile organic compound ( VOC ) . Importantly lung cancer , VOC signal across TNM stage disease , ( I though IV ) . Hypotheses - VOC breath test patient early stage ( Tis/T1 ) Larynx cancer stage 3 4 Larynx cancer - Early Advanced Larynx Cancer VOC signal different smoking control Methods Breath test do use Cyranose ENose Thoracic Medicine Established protocol test Lung Cancer study , x 2 single expiration collection bag Ideally would best do lesion see ENT surgeon BEFORE biopsied ( avoid confounding effect VOCs tissue disruption biopsy ) The ENose software allow comparison 3 group 10 subject - 10 Tis/T1 , 10 advance Larynx Ca , 10 smoking control demonstrate normal ENT tracheobronchial tree . Patients would routine panendoscopy treatment NBI exclude concommittant second primary disease either head neck Bronchial tree Potential Significance Proof principal screen detect highly treatable lesion Supportive data similar tumour , particularly Squamous cell carcinoma bronchus , viz benefit early detection Procedures All do Thoracic Mediine department Breath test sample VOCs : A portable breath collection apparatus capture VOCs slow vital capacity exhalation breath sample , use Standard Operation Procedure process already place .
