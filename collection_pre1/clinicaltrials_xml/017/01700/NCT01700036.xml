	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study safety efficacy use drug Zemaira , Alpha 1-Antitrypsin ( AAT ) medication ( also know Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor [ Human ] ) treatment steroid refractory GVHD . For bone marrow transplant patient , common , serious complication Graft v Host Disease ( GVHD ) , severe life-threatening , complication significant cause treatment relate death , follow stem cell transplantation . GVHD major obstacle overall success transplant treatment , strategy would otherwise provide possibility cure patient blood cancer severe blood disorder . GVHD primarily affect skin , gut , liver recipient , involve interaction recipient 's ( host 's ) cell tissue donor 's immune system cell see host tissue foreign , attack host 's cell result tissue organ damage . The severity acute GvHD range mild severe , patient n't respond steroid therapy , complication nearly always fatal , either organ damage opportunistic infection consequence high dose , steroid treatment . There currently know effective therapy patient acute graft v host disease 's refractory ( nonresponsive ) steroid therapy . As state earlier , overwhelm majority patient may ultimately die infection . The incidence acute GvHD require intervention , high unrelated donor transplant , common treatment option available , therefore , patient high risk treatment related complication GVHD . Approximately 20,000 unrelated donor transplant perform year . The magnitude problem significant patient otherwise might cure blood cancer disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year Patients must clinical evidence* steroidrefractory acute Graft v Host Disease ( organ ) define one following : No change progression stage skin GvHD least 1 week 2mg/kg/day methylprednisolone ( po equivalent ) lack response visceral ( liver , GI ) GvHD despite treatment 2mg/kg/day methylprednisolone least 72h . progression visceral GvHD despite treatment 2mg/kg/day methylprednisolone least 48h visceral GvHD progressing stage 4 24h 2mg/kg/d methylprednisolone Patients protract acute GvHD respond least 0.5mg/kg/d prednisone consider eligible . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . * As GvHD clinical diagnosis , patient already initiate steroid therapy discretion attend physician , tissue confirmation refractory GvHD biopsy require entry study . It anticipate , , patient undergone tissue confirmation initial diagnosis GvHD ; however lack tissue confirmation clinical syndrome exclusionary . As patient steroid refractory acute GvHD quite ill multiple abnormal lab organ dysfunction , explicit laboratory value degree organ dysfunction specifically preclude enrollment study . Baseline lab study obtain follow throughout trial standard care patient GvHD . Pregnancy Nursing Mother Vasopressor requirement Patients may receive investigational agent treatment GvHD time study entry time study another investigational agent impact primary clinical outcome analysis know pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetic effect AAT .
