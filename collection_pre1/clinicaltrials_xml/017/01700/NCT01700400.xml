	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether investigational study drug everolimus may use increase effectiveness chemotherapy treatment patient advance lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Everolimus , Pemetrexed , Carboplatin , Bevacizumab Treat Stage IV Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced lung cancer remain incurable disease although new agent new treatment strategy result improved survival outcome patient . Most recently interest augment tumor response chemotherapy addition drug inhibit tumor cell growth proliferation . Everolimus new cancer drug work inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , mTOR protein part signal pathway cause cancer cell divide . Everolimus use alone single agent produce response well prolonged stable disease chemo-naïve pre-treated non-small cell lung cancer . The goal study evaluate safety everolimus combine cancer drug call pemetrexed , carboplatin , bevacizumab . Pemetrexed carboplatin chemotherapy drug bevacizumab inhibits growth new blood vessel . Patients enter onto dose cohort 3 patient accord follow dose escalation scheme . The first cohort begin dose level 1 . At least three patient dose level must complete cycle one study leadership ( principal investigator , study statistician ) allow patient enrol onto successive dose level . Dose Levels : 1 , 2 , 3 Pemetrexed ( mg/m² ) : 500 , 500 , 500 Carboplatin ( AUC ) : 5 , 6 , 6 Bevacizumab ( mg/kg ) : 15 , 15 , 15 Everolimus ( mg/day ) : 2.5 , 2.5 , 5.0 The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose , MTD , combination everolimus pemetrexed , carboplatin , bevacizumab patient Stage IV non-squamous , non small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
