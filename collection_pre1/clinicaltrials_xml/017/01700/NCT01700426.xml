	<brief_summary>The study address treatment iron deficiency , common nutritional deficiency infant young child encounter . With knowledge iron deficiency may irreversibly affect baby 's long-term neurodevelopment behavior , investigator offer free screen blood draw Children 's Hospital Colorado old baby toddler ( 9-24 month old ) . If blood result indicate serum ferritin â‰¤ 15 micrograms/dL without presence elevate C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , invite continue intervention portion study , receive iron supplement well vitamin E ( placebo ) eight week treatment period . The rationale study test whether addition Vitamin E , antioxidant anti-inflammatory agent , improve treatment response supplemental iron .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enhancing Treatment Iron Deficiency Iron Deficiency Anemia Antioxidant , Vitamin E Synopsis/Abstract Iron Deficiency ( ID ) Iron Deficiency Anemia ( IDA ) common old breastfed infant toddler . Treatment 3-6 mg iron/kg/day recommend American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) , regimen often result modest change iron status , despite substantially high dose ( relative body weight ) commonly use adult . We propose high therapeutic dos iron induce inflammatory response , thus increase hepatic synthesis critical regulator iron absorption , hepcidin , function limit iron absorption context inflammation . In infant toddler find ID IDA , propose evaluate efficacy addition Vitamin E iron therapy compare dose iron alone . Our primary hypothesis infant toddler ID IDA , 2 month supplemental Vitamin E combine therapeutic iron supplementation efficacious dose iron alone . The study design randomize , double blind efficacy trial 2 month iron therapy ( 6 mg/kg/day ) without Vitamin E ( 18 mg/day ) , infants toddler ID IDA 9 24 month age . Primary outcome include biomarkers iron status ( ferritin , hemoglobin , transferrin saturation , transferrin receptor ) ; secondary outcome include biomarkers inflammation oxidant stress . Subjects : We screen old infant ( 9-12 month age ) predominantly breastfed least first 9 month life , toddler ( 12-24 month age ) breastfed and/or modest dietary iron intake . Intervention : Sixty-eight subject find ID IDA consent randomized one two treatment regimen ( 34 subject per group ) . Liquid supplement preparation iron ( group ) , Vitamin E ( test ) placebo ( control ) distribute research pharmacy The Children 's Hospital.Children 's Hospital Colorado . Outcomes : Biomarkers iron status , iron homeostasis , oxidant stress , systemic intestinal inflammation repeat end intervention . If hypothesis support , finding would provide simple effective modification enhance iron therapy , improve balance adequate iron uptake meet physiologic need excessive iron intake potential adverse effect . I . Goals objective : The broad goal proposal improve health nutrition young child improve iron status infant toddler develop iron deficiency ( ID ) iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) . The specific objective test intervention propose enhance efficacy , minimize potential toxicity , therapeutic iron infant young child dietary iron deficiency . Iron deficiency common micronutrient deficiency world negatively impact health several way 1 , 2 . ID IDA contribute stunt impaired growth , increase behavioral problem , delay mental motor development 3 , 4 , 5-7 . Studies also show behavioral developmental consequence ID IDA young child reversible treatment 8 . Despite fortification infant toddler food United States , significant number child still develop ID IDA 9 . Current treatment recommendation include wide dosage range ( 3-6 mg/kg/day ) , represent amount high routine supplementation level adult ( typically equivalent &lt; 1 mg/kg/day ) , reflect challenge imprecision effective treatment ID IDA child . Iron excess without risk , study adults show local ( intestinal ) systemic inflammatory change within day iron therapy initiation 10 , 11 . Recent advance understand regulation iron homeostasis metabolism indicate systemic inflammation induces protein call hepcidin , block uptake iron body12 , 13 . Thus , stimulation inflammation high dose iron supplement may actually counteract intended beneficial effect increase iron intake . Vitamin E essential nutrient function antioxidant anti-inflammatory agent , study many potentially beneficial facet human health , include potential protection heart disease14 ; accelerate age mediate DNA damage ; impaired immunity 15 . Research adult give antioxidant along iron therapy associate reduce oxidative potential . In study , palm oil extract contain approximately 7 mg Vitamin E supplement along iron therapy associate reduced fecal oxidation 16 Alpha-tocopherol study form Vitamin E , show decrease biomarkers total body oxidative stress inflammation 15 , 17 . We propose accomplish primary specific objective test effect treatment outcomes administration Vitamin E along iron supplement . II . Hypotheses : Our central hypothesis infant toddler ID IDA , 2 month supplemental Vitamin E combine therapeutic iron supplementation 6 mg/kg/day efficacious dose iron alone . The specific hypothesis test intervention : Hypothesis 1 : Subjects receive iron vitamin E supplement significantly great change serum ferritin ( reflect great improvement iron status ) , subject receive iron alone eight week supplementation . Hypothesis 2 : Significantly subject receive iron vitamin E supplement improve iron status profile , include ferritin , transferrin saturation , serum transferrin receptor , subject receive iron alone . Hypothesis 3 Subjects receive iron vitamin E supplement significantly low level inflammatory oxidant stress biomarkers subject receive iron alone . Hypothesis 4 : ( exploratory ) : The exposure two month iron therapy associate significantly alter intestinal bacterial profile compare baseline , end therapy , placebo group great predominance potentially pathogenic bacterial phylum .</detailed_description>
