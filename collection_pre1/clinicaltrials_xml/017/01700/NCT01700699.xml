	<brief_summary>- Background : BRAFV600E frequent oncogene differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) occur 50 % case . Clinical trial tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) specific activity BRAF metastatic radioiodine-resistant DTC ( MRR-DTC ) ongoing . Very recently demonstrate DTC often consist mixture tumor cell wild-type mutant BRAF . The subclonal occurrence BRAFV600E MRR-DTC could disable therapy BRAF target TKI responsible frequent defeat treatment . A therapeutic strategy base upon BRAF inhibitor tumor bear subclonal BRAFV600E could initially successful hit tumor cell express oncogene , initial tumor growth arrest and/or shrinkage , oncogene negative cell insensitive less sensitive treatment , could restart growth tumor cause progression disease escape clinical response . - Aims : To determine impact subclonal BRAFV600E efficacy BRAF inhibitor treatment MRR-DTC . - Study design : Primary tumor tissue analyze presence BRAFV600E pyrosequencing quantitative assay . If available , synchronous metastasis post-therapy metachronous metastasis analyze well . The clinical response determine accord RECIST , association percentage BRAFV600E allele evaluate . Attention pay possible difference BRAFwild-type/BRAFV600E ratio primary tumor synchronous metastasis , primary tumor post-therapy metachronous metastasis , responsive resistant synchronous tumor lesion .</brief_summary>
