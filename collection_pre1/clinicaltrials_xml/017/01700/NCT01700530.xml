	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Determine simvastatin impairs exercise training adaptation . BACKGROUND : Statins commonly prescribe combination therapeutic lifestyle change , include exercise , reduce cardiovascular disease risk patient metabolic syndrome . Statin use link skeletal muscle myopathy impair mitochondrial function , unclear whether statin use alters adaptation exercise training . METHODS : We examine effect simvastatin change cardiorespiratory fitness skeletal muscle mitochondrial content response aerobic exercise training . Sedentary overweight obese adult least 2 metabolic syndrome risk factor ( define accord National Cholesterol Education Panel Adult Treatment Panel III criterion ) randomize 12 week aerobic exercise training exercise combination simvastatin ( 40 mg per day ) . The primary outcome cardiorespiratory fitness skeletal muscle ( vastus lateralis ) mitochondrial content ( citrate synthase enzyme activity ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sedentary metabolic syndrome subject 2559 age overweight Class I II obese ( BMI 2539 kg/m2 ) men woman 2 4 characteristic metabolic syndrome include fast glucose 100 125 mg/dl ; waist circumference great 102 cm men 88 cm woman , serum triglyceride concentration great 150 mg/dl , HDLC concentration less 40 mg/dl men 50 mg/dl woman , blood pressure great 130/85 mmHG Women must take birth control postmenopausal . Diagnosed cardiovascular disease diabetes disease Symptoms could alter ability perform exercise Fasting blood glucose great 126 mg/dl Smoking Taking medication supplement ( e.g. , statin , fibrates , metformin , thiazolidenediones , antihypertensive ( ACEinhibitors angiotensin blocker ) could affect blood lipid insulin sensitivity . Women pregnant plan become pregnant duration study Individuals exercise regularly ( one 30 min session per week ) Individuals orthopedic limitation walk . Report allergies medication ( statin , lidocaine )</criteria>
