	<brief_summary>Introduction Liver resection consider curative treatment option mCRC patient without extrahepatic disease accept practice . Despite substantial improvement surgical technique , postoperative morbidity mortality remain important concern major resection . Complications liver resection , although rare , include liver failure acute kidney injury indicate oliguria increase serum creatinine . The underlying pathophysiological pathway post-operative renal alteration follow liver resection increase portal venous pressure , base observation animal model small cohort . The corpus data derive patient liver cirrhosis subsequent hepatorenal syndrome . These data limit since cirrhosis distinguish metabolic change , portal hypertension impair liver function elucidation pathogenesis renal alteration . Liver resection therefore potent model evaluate impact portal hypertension kidney despite stable liver function . The significant factor determine morbidity mortality follow hepatectomy ability remnant liver regenerate . In context , several growth factor show regulate highly orchestrated process liver regeneration ( LR ) . Hypothesis The investigator therefore test hypothesis liver resection lead sustained increase portalvenous pressure subsequent episode oliguric renal impairment , correlate quantity resect liver . Furthermore , investigator examine relationship postoperative liver regeneration circulate growth factor level patient undergo hepatectomy . Based preclinical data investigator hypothesize circulate growth factor level associate delay liver regeneration , increase incidence postoperative liver dysfunction concomitant bad clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
