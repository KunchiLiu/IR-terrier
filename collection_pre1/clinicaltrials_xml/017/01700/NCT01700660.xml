	<detailed_description>Rationale Major liver surgery often require surgeon temporarily halt afferent blood flow order prevent excessive blood loss . Vascular inflow occlusion ( VIO ) however predispose liver detrimental inflammatory response circulation restore . Altogether , ramification result temporary withdrawal oxygen supply know ischemia reperfusion ( I/R ) injury , extent occur determine functional outcome liver surgery . Recently , become clear ( ) activation immune system form mainstay hepatic I/R injury . More importantly , show animal model endogenous self-antigens , know damage-associated molecular pattern ( DAMPs ) , release stress liver cell early stage reperfusion , , form proximal trigger hepatic I/R injury . Clinical data DAMP release follow hepatic I/R however scarce date . Therefore , aim study investigate DAMP release patient undergo major liver resection without VIO correlate result expression acute- phase inflammatory response gene routine clinical parameter hepatocellular damage . Objective To investigate release damage-associated molecular pattern ( DAMPs ) follow major hepatic resection without VIO correlate outcome acute inflammatory response clinical parameter hepatocellular damage . Study design The study design observational study . Because decision apply VIO often make surgery , patient allocate group postoperatively . Therefore , inclusion subject study continue calculate sample size 15 patient reach group . Study population Eligible patient participation study diagnose malignant benign hepatic tumor schedule undergo major hepatectomy ( resection â‰¥3 segment ) . Main study parameters/endpoints The primary endpoint study define effect I/R release DAMPs , measure systemic circulation . Secondary parameter constitute expression acute inflammatory response gene , AST , ALT , total bilirubin , INR .</detailed_description>
