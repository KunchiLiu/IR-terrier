	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate safety effectiveness oral vismodegib therapy treatment different 'histologic subtypes ' basal cell skin cancer ( BCC ) . The term 'histologic subtype ' refers cell tumor tissue look microscope . Three different 'histologic subtypes ' basal cell skin cancer ( infiltrative/morpheaform , nodular superficial ) examine study . Each subtype characteristic look microscope , related tumor behave grow . The histologic subtype also help give doctor information quickly basal cell skin cancer grow , come back spread part body . ERIVEDGE ( oral vismodegib capsule ) approve use United States treatment metastatic BCC tumor ( mBCC ) , tumor spread skin , bone tissue , spread part body locally advance basal cell skin cancer ( laBCC ) , cancer come back surgery healthcare provider think treat surgery radiation . It work block signal , call Hedgehog , basal cell skin cancer cell need grow . It give 800 people clinical trial . Data previous study mostly base subtype BCC make little round collection cancer cell , call `` Nodular '' . There almost data use vismodegib subtypes BCC tend extend deep skin ( `` Infiltrative '' subtype ) , spread widely near surface skin ( `` Superficial '' subtype ) . We know subtype BCC 'can affect response type treatment . A total 36 subject enrol study . All study participant receive oral vismodegib treatment . At Week 12 visit , skin biopsy perform give u information tumor respond vismodegib . If evidence tumor biopsy , eligible end treatment early enter Observation period . During time follow clinically every 3 month 1 year . For subject , evidence tumor see biopsy week 12 , continue treatment full 24 week . At week 24 visit , skin biopsy perform see tumor leave . If evidence tumor biopsy , eligible end treatment early enter Observation period . If tumor leave , refer surgery standard care treatment remove tumor .</detailed_description>
