	<brief_summary>Primary objective : 1 . To examine efficacy melatonin treatment neurocognitive functioning adult survivor childhood cancer . Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate efficacy melatonin treatment delay sleep onset latency long-term childhood cancer survivor . 2 . To investigate whether improvement sleep onset latency due melatonin treatment associate neurocognitive improvement long-term childhood cancer survivor . This study randomize double-blind placebo control trial time release melatonin adult survivor childhood cancer demonstrate impair neurocognitive functioning and/or difficulty fall asleep .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melatonin Intervention For Neurocognitive Deficits St. Jude Lifetime Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participant undergo general neurocognitive evaluation baseline 6-month follow-up , focus assessment intelligence , academic skill , attention , process speed , memory executive function . Sleep parameter use self-report actigraphy assess three time point study : Baseline , 3-months , 6-months . Participants divide 3 mutually exclusive group : - Cohort 1 : Participant neurocognitive impairment define performance least one measure attention , memory , and/or executive function 10th percentile , AND absent delay sleep onset latency define inability fall asleep within 30 minute less week past month . - Cohort 2 : Participant neurocognitive impairment define performance least one measure attention , memory , and/or executive function 10th percentile , AND delay sleep onset latency define self-report inability fall asleep within 30 minute least week past month . - Cohort 3 : Participant absent neurocognitive impairment define performance &gt; 10th percentile six measure attention , memory , executive functioning , AND delay sleep onset latency define self-report inability fall asleep within 30 minute &gt; week past month . Within group , participant randomly assign take either 3 mg time release melatonin placebo 1-2 hour bedtime night 6 month . Psychosocial measure health-related quality life psychological distress complete baseline follow 6 month melatonin/placebo treatment . Biological sample serum melatonin level collect baseline 6 month follow-up evaluation .</detailed_description>
