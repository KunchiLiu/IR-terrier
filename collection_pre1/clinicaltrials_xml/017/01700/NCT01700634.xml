	<brief_summary>The aim project investigate fMRI ability identify pain central sensitization chronic knee OA . Patients high low central sensitization healthy control subject include . Central sensitization clinically define base evidence regional spread pain ( spread sensitization ) increase pain response repeat stimulation ( temporal summation ) . Operatively , patient assign high sensitization group show ( ) clinical evidence pain alter sensation spread beyond knee joint manual palpation , ( ii ) minimum 3 anatomical site around knee show pressure pain threshold 4 kg/cm2 ( tender point ) , ( iii ) pain score 4 point 11-point scale 4 kg/cm2 pressure stimulation anterior/medial surface tibial bone ( site select fMRI experiment ) ( iv ) increase least 1 point 11-point scale 10 repeated pressure stimulation tender point around knee . A three-step strategy propose characterize phenomenon assess ( ) brain response direct pressure stimulation painful knee , reflect combination peripheral central sensitization ; ( ii ) brain response pressure stimulation non-arthritic hyperalgesic area ( i.e. , anterior surface tibia ) , mostly reflect central sensitization mediate spinal cord level , ( iii ) brain response moderately painful heat stimulation healthy skin area ( i.e. , volar forearm ) , reflect central sensitization occur brain involve highest-level pain modulatory mechanism . An additional evaluation propose use resting-state fMRI ass potential alteration baseline brain functional organization .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients : 1 . A diagnosis knee OA suitable study determine responsible physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . 2 . Have radiological clinical diagnosis knee OA base upon American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion ( 1986 ) affect least one knee minimum 3 month symptom duration prior screen . 3 . Subject either male female least 45 year age . 4 . A minimum 4 10 numerical rating scale ( Brief Pain Inventory BPI item 5 ) screening and/ requirement use analgesic pain OA knee . In addition , baseline pain must stable least 72 hour prior fMRI assessment fMRI assessment may delay . 5 . A maximum 8 10 NRS screening . Enrolment may delay , opinion investigator , severity pain represent isolated incident . 6 . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential . 7 . Body weight &lt; 120kg . 8 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . 9 . Subject demonstrate understand study willingness participate evidence voluntary write informed consent . Controls : 1 . Subject either male female least 45 year age . 2 . Absence clinically relevant neurologic psychiatric disease history head trauma loss consciousness . 3 . Absence noncompensated medical disease pain disorder may relevantly affect brain function pain perception . 4 . No clinical evidence knee OA . 5 . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential . 6 . Body weight &lt; 120kg . 7 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . 8 . Subject demonstrate understand study willingness participate evidence voluntary write informed consent . 1 . Subjects permit heavily exercise 12 hour prior fMRI assessment 2 . Subjects require refrain following treatment : I. Analgesic antiinflammatory drug 3 day prior fMRI assessment except rescue medication . Rescue medication base paracetamol ( dosed 1g/8h ) , case must withdraw minimum 24 h prior fMRI assessment fMRI assessment may delay . II . Steroid injection joint muscle three month prior fMRI assessment III . Hyaluronan injection index knee within previous 6 month prior fMRI assessment IV . Nonpharmacological treatment , heat wrap massage 24 hour prior fMRI assessment . V. Antidepressants allow : MAOIs , Tricyclic antidepressant , mixed 5HT &amp; NE reuptake inhibitor ( eg . Duloxetine ) . SISR allow recent prescription , moreover allow case chronic use ( 6 week ) . If drug use less 6 week , patient could participate study washout period . VI . Anticonvulsant indicate pain killer allow , patient could participate study washout period . VII . Patients take low dos hypnotic drug ( eg . Lorazepam 1mg/OD Diazepam 5mg/OD ) use chronic prescription ( 6 week ) . If use less 6 week , patient could participate study washout period . Subjects allowed take chronic ( nonanalgesic nonantiinflammatory ) medication treatment use continuously least six week prior assessment .</criteria>
