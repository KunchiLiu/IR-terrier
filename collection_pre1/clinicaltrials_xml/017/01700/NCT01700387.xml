	<detailed_description>Numerous migraine preventive medication well know associate cognitive impairment disruption mood . Clinvest would propose pilot study chronic migraine patient randomize 1:1 onabotulinumtoxinA daily topiramate onabotulinumtoxinA placebo . This pilot study examine degree subject able tolerate satisfy migraine preventive medication addition onabotulinumtoxinA extend period time effect subject ' quality life compare onabotulinumtoxinA single therapy . It also assess short long term effect two treatment cognition . Cognitive performance measure Mental Efficiency Workload Test ( MEWT ) , repeat measure handheld neuropsychological test battery measure mental efficiency via 4 sub-test ( Simple Reaction Time , Running Memory , Continuous Performance Task , Matching Sample , Mathematical Processing ) demonstrate short long term change mental status compare baseline . The Controlled Oral Word Association Test ( COWAT ) use test verbal fluency screen anomic aphasia , know side effect several migraine prophylactic medication include topiramate . Visit 1 - Screening / Baseline Following Informed Consent medical , headache , medication history collect physical neurological exam perform subject . A urine pregnancy test collect subject child-bearing potential . Vital sign ECG ( discretion investigator ) complete . The Mental Efficiency Workload Test ( MEWT ) administer 3 time establish cognitive efficiency baseline . The COWAT complete . Subjects instruct regard completion online 1-month Baseline Period Migraine Diary instruct treat headache 1-month Baseline Period usual acute migraine medication usual manner . Visit 2 - Randomization / Injection Following 1-month Baseline Period , change medical medication history since previous visit collect pregnancy test collect appropriate . Vital sign record . Subjects continue meet eligibility criterion instruct complete online Treatment Period Migraine Diary daily . The MEWT , HIT-6 , Migraine Specific Questionnaire ( MSQ ) COWAT complete . The coordinator ass compliance online headache diary deviation outside 100 % compliance document site . If investigator 's opinion , subject maintain high level compliance online headache diary , subject randomize study . Eligible subject randomize 1:1 blinded fashion receive onabotulinumtoxinA 31 fixed-site , fixed-dose injection across seven ( 7 ) specific head/neck muscle area daily topiramate ( Group A ) onabotulinumtoxinA 31 fixed-site , fixed-dose injection across seven ( 7 ) specific head/neck muscle area placebo match topiramate ( Group B ) . Daily study medication ( topiramate placebo ) dispense follow 3 month . The Group A topiramate titration schedule follow : Week 1 : topiramate 25 mg qhs ( every night bedtime ) Week 2 : topiramate 25 mg bid ( twice day ) Week 3 : topiramate 25 mg q ( everyday noon ) + topiramate 50 mg qhs Week 4 : topiramate 50mg bid Only one dosage adjustment ( increase decrease ) , base efficacy tolerability , may make investigator 's discretion . Subjects must maintain dose least 50 mg/day remain Treatment Period . The Group B placebo schedule follow : Week 1 : 1 tab qhs Week 2 : 1 tab bid Week 3 : 1 tab q + 2 tab qhs Week 4 : 2 tab bid Subjects instruct complete online daily Treatment Period Migraine Diary next 3-month period . Following Visit 2 , subject phone monthly adverse event collect . Subjects also send weekly reminder 8 week follow Visit 2 via email take study medication , complete online diary contact coordinator question concern may . During titration period , subject Group A experience adverse event think relate study medication dosage return clinic Unscheduled Visit dosage adjustment . Visit 3 Three month follow Visit 2 , subject return complete MEWT , HIT-6 , MSQ , COWAT , Subject 's Global Impression Change ( SGIC ) . The Investigator complete Physician 's Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) . Any change medical medication history since previous visit collect pregnancy test collect appropriate . Vital sign record . The coordinator ass compliance online headache diary deviation outside 100 % compliance document site . If investigator 's opinion , subject maintain high level compliance online headache diary , subject allow continue study . All subject administer dose 155 U onabotulinumtoxinA 31 fixed-site , fixed-dose injection across seven ( 7 ) specific head/neck muscle area . Any unused study medication use packaging collect , drug accountability perform , daily study medication ( topiramate placebo ) dispense follow 3 month . Subjects instruct complete online daily Treatment Period Migraine Diary next 3-month period . Following Visit 3 , subject phone monthly adverse event collect . Visit 4 Three month follow Visit 3 , subject return complete MEWT , HIT-6 , MSQ , COWAT , Subject 's Global Impression Change ( SGIC ) . The Investigator complete Physician 's Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) . Any change medical medication history since previous visit collect pregnancy test collect appropriate . Vital sign record .
