	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) major cause impairment child population . Indeed , CP affect two birth per thousand ( 1 ) . The brain damage express different neurological impairment functional disability . These disability justify intensive sustain multidisciplinary rehabilitation reduce neurological impairment , improve activity participation patient , , ultimately , quality life ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) . Robotics interest already show low limb rehabilitation ( 5 ) . The development upper limb rehabilitation robotic device start later . To well stimulate brain plasticity , tools meet actual recommendation exist CP 's rehabilitation ( 4 ) . Indeed , robot allow execution large number movement whose quality control ( 6 ) . A visual interface give patient feedback movement ( 7 ) , offer exercise orient functional task mean ( 8 ) possibly dive virtual reality . All element justify clinical development robot assist therapist . In child CP , several pilot study verify clinical applicability tool ( 9-11 ) . However , randomize control study perform evaluate effectiveness robotic-assisted therapy child CP ( 12 ) . Moreover , study evaluate effect therapy three area ICF : Many study focus impairment ( e.g . muscle ) without assess functional capacity patient : ability every day life ? OBJECTIVES To perform prospective , randomize , control , single blind trial ass efficacy robotic-assisted therapy child cerebral palsy evaluate three field ICF . METHODS Twenty patient enrol `` Institut Royal de l'Accueil du Handicap Moteur '' ( IRAHM ) ( 1200 Brussels ) include accord follow criterion : CP , whose location unilateral ( hemiplegia ) bilateral ( diplegia , quadriplegia ) , MACS ( Manual Ability Classification System ) score &gt; 1 ( moderate severe motor impairment ) ( 13 ) . The exclusion criterion follow : injection upper member botulinum toxin within 6 month intrathecal baclofen use upper limb , unstable clinical condition contraindicate upper limb rehabilitation treatment , cognitive disorder prevent understanding instruction neurological orthopedic pathology affect upper limb . A randomisation patient two group ( control experimental ) perform , use stratify randomization method ensure equivalence two group age , location symptom ( diplegia , quadriplegia , leave right hemiplegia ) motor neurological impairment ( MACS score ) . At IRAHM , child benefit 3 physiotherapy session 2 occupational therapy session per week . Each session last 45 minute . The child control group see change treatment . In experimental group , 1 physiotherapy session 1 occupational therapy session replace two session intensive rehabilitation arm robot . In total group , child benefit 40 session 45 minute 8 week therapy Patients evaluate three time study : start treatment , end treatment , 3 month end treatment . Functional assessment carry accord protocol explore three field ICF . Impairments evaluate score Quality Upper Extremity Skills Test ( 14 ) , MACS ( 13 ) , Box Block test ( 15 ) . Then , spasticity ( two scale ) , kinematics strength paretic arm evaluate use modify Ashworth Tardieu scale , ReaPLAN robot dynamometer , respectively ( 9 , 16 , 17 ) . Disability evaluate via Abilhand-kids ( 18 ) Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory ( 19 ) . Participation restriction evaluate via MHAVIE questionnaire ( 20 ) . All assessment carry occupational therapist , inform group child assign ( single-blind ) . All rehabilitation assessment session conduct IRAHM . PERSPECTIVES From study , hope demonstrate efficacy robotic-assisted therapy child cerebral palsy evaluate three field ICF . These result could prove tool significant complement CP rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
