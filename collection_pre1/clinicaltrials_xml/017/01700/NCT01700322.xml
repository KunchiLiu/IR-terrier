	<brief_summary>Endothelial dysfunction important predictor - determinant - adverse clinical outcome . Endothelial function impair coronary artery stenting , stud group show improved platelet inhibition use clopidogrel . However , clopidogrel unresponsiveness know problem , show endothelial effect clopidogrel tend wane upon prolonged treatment . Whether effective anti-platelet therapy able prevent/improve thrombotic event also endothelial dysfunction , potential positive impact clinical outcome patient undergoing coronary artery stenting , important hypothesis need investigate . To date , evidence regard `` ancillary '' ( non-platelet-dependent ) effect antiaggregant drug limit . For instance , antiplatelet effect , beneficial effect patient acute coronary syndrome , clearly demonstrate multicentric trial , remain show whether drug also protect endothelial function . Interestingly , author suggest mortality benefit observe PLATO study least part independent direct antiplatelet effect . No study , date , test effect prasugrel and/or ticagrelor endothelial function . With present trial , investigator plan test effect clopidogrel , prasugrel ticagrelor endothelial function 4 week coronary artery stenting . This study provide important pathophysiologic insight relationship platelet aggregation endothelial function , two parameter show influence patient ' prognosis .</brief_summary>
