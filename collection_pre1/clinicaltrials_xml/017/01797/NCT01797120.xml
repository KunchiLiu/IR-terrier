	<brief_summary>Post-menopausal woman hormone-receptor positive ( HR+ ) metastatic breast cancer resistant aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy randomize receive Fulvestrant ( Faslodex ) Everolimus Fulvestrant ( Faslodex ) placebo ( active ingredient ) . Fulvestrant demonstrate activity use first , second , third line endocrine therapy , make attractive therapy combination agent . In addition , commonly reserve use follow disease progression AI therapy . Everolimus orally administer drug block signal pathway call `` mTOR '' . `` mTOR '' act regulator many process body , include cell growth . Blocking pathway may effect cell growth . The combination novel class agent ( mTOR inhibitor ) establish standard treatment metastatic HR+ breast cancer may potentially increase clinical benefit target multiple different biological pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Fulvestrant +/- Everolimus Post-Menopausal , Hormone-Receptor + Metastatic Breast Ca Resistant AI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer commonly diagnose malignancy woman worldwide . In United States , estimate 230,480 new case invasive breast cancer diagnose 2011 , 39,520 breast cancer death . In 40-80 % woman node-positive disease diagnosis , breast cancer recur . When distant metastasis occur , median survival 18 36 month time recurrence . Among 60-70 % woman HR+ breast cancer , 40-60 % benefit endocrine therapy . Endocrine therapy show yield similar survival rate hormone-sensitive disease compare chemotherapy ; although response rate lower response develop slowly . Endocrine therapy considerably less toxic chemotherapy , therefore preferred treatment option patient HR+ disease . Endocrine therapy represent foundation treatment HR+ metastatic locally advance breast cancer . Multiple compound vary class exist , widely use include selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) , aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) , selective estrogen receptor down-regulators ( SERDs ) . Although utility drug well establish , many 50 % woman HR+ breast cancer fail respond endocrine treatment . Moreover , respond inevitably develop acquire resistance . Fulvestrant first drug act pure estrogen receptor ( ER ) antagonist without know agonist effect . It competitively bind ERs approximately 100 time great affinity tamoxifen . Fulvestrant promote degradation ERs subsequently prevent ER-mediated gene transcription . Everolimus ( RAD001 ) oral derivative rapamycin m-TOR inhibitor . At cellular molecular level , everolimus act signal transduction inhibitor . Everolimus selectively inhibit mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) ; key highly conserve serine-threonine kinase present cell central regulator protein synthesis ultimately cell growth , cell proliferation , angiogenesis cell survival . mTOR currently know target everolimus . In oncology , everolimus clinical development since 2002 patient various hematologic non-hematologic malignancy single agent combination antitumor agent , include cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , targeted therapy , antibody hormonal agent . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) receive everolimus placebo fulvestrant consideration stratification factor performance status ( 0 vs. 1 ) , measurable disease ( without non-measurable ) vs. non-measurable disease , prior chemotherapy metastatic disease vs. prior chemotherapy . Patients evaluate disease response every 12 week treat disease progression unacceptable toxicity total 12 cycle . Patients evidence progressive disease remain study complete 12 cycle unblinded continue receive fulvestrant alone ( originally randomize placebo ) combination everolimus ( originally randomize everolimus ) dose schedule . Patients continue evaluated disease response every 12 week continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
