	<brief_summary>Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) relatively frequent eye disease often occur patient professionally active age range . In disease , pool fluid central retina ( macula ) . This specific form macular degeneration cause permanent vision loss , image distortion , loss color contrast vision due fluid retina . An early diagnosis treatment may improve visual outcome quality life . To date international consensus optimal treatment chronic CSC . Many retrospective study suggest treatment photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) effective chronic CSC . Micropulse laser ( ML ) therapy may also effective disease . The propose study first prospective randomize control trial chronic CSC . In study , participant chronic CSC randomize two treatment group , PDT ML treatment . The trial superiority study , retrospective study suggest PDT treatment may effective ML treatment . Therefore , PDT treatment challenge ML treatment . The null hypothesis study PDT treatment effective ML treatment patient active chronic CSC . The alternative hypothesis PDT treatment effective ML treatment patient . Treatment success base anatomical improvement , also functional endpoint , important patient 's perspective . The study take place five large tertiary referral university hospital Europe extensive experience conduct clinical trial ( Nijmegen , Netherlands ; Cologne , Germany ; Leiden , Netherlands ; Oxford , United Kingdom ; Paris , France ) . Each center confirm sufficient funding conduct research . The study last max . 8 month per participant . Each participant come 5 ( case 1 treatment ) 7 visit ( case 2 treatment ) . Study evaluation mostly part regular clinical care . The whole study last max . 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Controlled Treatment Trial Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE AND DESIGN There international consensus optimal treatment protocol chronic CSC . Nevertheless , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) emerge treatment choice many centre worldwide . PDT use photosensitive drug , verteporfin ( Visudyne® ) , administer intravenously treatment specific type laser . PDT treatment develop originally treatment another form macular degeneration , age-related macular degeneration , extensive data available . There several retinal disease PDT verteporfin successfully use off-label treatment . The use PDT treatment chronic CSC base high rate anatomic success , increase visual acuity , improvement retinal sensitivity , excellent safety profile report many retrospective study . The PDT strategy generally use either half dose verteporfin ( Visudyne® ) full fluence ( energy ) laser treatment , half fluence level full dose verteporfin , half treatment time use full dose verteporfin full fluence , compare original protocol use neovascular age-related macular degeneration . These PDT strategy use either half-dose half-fluence treatment develop combination dosage fluence originally use treatment neovascular age-related macular degeneration show high risk develop choroidal ischemia retinal atrophic change . The half-dose half-fluence PDT strategy , however , show safe effective relatively large retrospective study one non-controlled non-randomized prospective study Chan et al . chronic CSC patient sufficient follow-up period . Therefore , tailor therapy obtain maximal treatment effect minimal toxicity essential treating patient CSC . By reduce dose verteporfin , study demonstrate potential retinal damage cause PDT minimize photodynamic effect induce choroidal vasculature change require treat CSC remain sufficient . We choose half-dose `` safety-enhanced '' protocol appear one safest effective treatment option patient active chronic CSC . PDT compare micropulse laser ( ML ) treatment control arm , sham conventional laser treatment , number reason . First , sham ( treatment ) study Chan et al . show large difference anatomic outcome ( complete resolution subretinal fluid ) functional outcome ( visual acuity ) half-dose PDT placebo group acute form CSC , often resolve spontaneously week contrast chronic CSC . As well-established prolonged leakage subretinal fluid macula due chronic CSC may lead permanent visual loss , desirable compare half-dose PDT treatment sham . Apart ethical consideration refrain compare sham , add third sham study arm would require extra amount study patient would complicate recruitment process . The treatment CSC ML treatment show effective safe retrospective study 41-58 % patient . The safety efficacy ML treatment also show various retinal disease . In contrast , show conventional laser treatment focal leakage point fluorescein angiography CSC result well visual outcome . Also , conventional laser treatment high risk complication ML PDT , include visual loss , scotoma , decrease color vision , decrease contrast sensitivity , choroidal neovascularization . The propose study superiority study , retrospective study suggest rate anatomical functional success half-dose PDT treatment might higher ML treatment . However , none previous study half-dose PDT ML treatment prospective , randomize , well control . Therefore , chosen challenge half-dose PDT treatment arm treatment arm ML treatment . The number visit examination reduce minimum , conform standard clinical care much possible . Extra examination include extensive visual acuity measurement , microperimetry , questionnaire . These extra examination require evaluate functional vision-related endpoint study . Care take plan examinations day much possible . RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT Patients inform treatment option eye disease currently available . Study investigator obtain consent participation study , consent currently available treatment outside study obtain medical nursing staff would do routinely . Written verbal version participant information inform consent present participant , detail exact nature study , implication constraint protocol , know side effect , risk involve take part . It clearly state participant free withdraw study time reason without prejudice future care , obligation give reason withdrawal . Care take avoid coercion undue influence `` recruiter '' potential participant . The potential participant allow much time wish consider information , opportunity question Investigator , General Practitioner independent party decide whether participate study . CONFIDENTIALITY The source document participant ' Case Report Form ( CRF ) data always remain study centre patient treat ( either Oxford , Cologne , Paris , Nijmegen ) . No person-identifiable information use unless absolutely necessary . The trial staff ensure participant ' anonymity maintain . The participant identify initial participant identification number CRF electronic database . All document store securely accessible trial staff authorise personnel . The study comply Data Protection Act require data anonymized soon practical . Anonymized data enter purpose-built digital database maintain contract research organisation , Clinical Research Centre Nijmegen ( www.crcn.nl ) , affiliate coordinate academic centre , Institute Ophthalmology Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre Nijmegen Netherlands .</detailed_description>
