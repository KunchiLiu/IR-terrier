	<brief_summary>The study conduct department Medical Oncology Hematology , All India Institute Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) . Patients various malignancy take high dose chemotherapy follow stem cell transplant ( blood marrow transplant ) high chance develop severe oral mucositis ( generally 60-80 % different study previous experience ) . This cause significant morbidity also hamper quality life need use parenteral nutrition , analgesic , antibiotic . No definite treatment exist prevention treatment oral mucositis group patient . Though one study suggest use IV palifermin ( keratinocyte growth factor ) reduce duration severity . Palifermin expensive available country . Recently investigator show effectiveness probiotic Lactobacillus CD 2 reduce incidence severity chemo-radiotherapy induce mucositis head neck squamous cell cancer patient . ( Published online European Journal Cancer : http : //dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2011.06.010 ) European Journal Cancer 2012 ; 4:875-881.No significant toxicity report use . A pilot study similar aspect complete recently center ( Clinical trial.gov identifier : NCT 01480011 ) 31 patient receive 6 ( 20 % ) develop grade III IV Mucositis . Now , investigator want study efficacy drug reduce severity mucositis patient undergo myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The study drug placebo supply CD Pharma India Private Limited . Investigators give undertake study carry per GCP declaration Helsinki .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Study Efficacy Lactobacillus CD2 Lozenges Preventing High-Dose Chemotherapy Induced Oral Mucositis Patients Undergoing Myeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Placebo control double blind randomize , multi center clinical trial . Study Population Number Subjects Total 108 patient undergoing myeloablative allogeneic autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation receive high-dose chemotherapy condition regimen AIIMS ( department Medical Oncology Hematology ) enrol study equally divide two group ( drug placebo ) . Study Center The study carry Departments Medical Oncology Hematology All India Institute Medical Sciences , New Delhi , India . More center likely add . Study Objectives To test whether probiotic Lactobacillus CD2 ( drug ) lozenges reduce incidence severity condition therapy induce oral mucositis patient undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Investigational Product Drug : The trial medication form lozenge , suppose dissolve mouth . It contain less 2x109 ( 2 billion ) viable cell Lactobacillus CD2 active ingredient . Placebo : The placebo mix sugar salt use excipients active formulation . Note : Placebo drug lozenges similar physical appearance color . Dose Study drug The daily dose trial medication 4-6 lozenge per day , one lozenge take every 2-3 hour preferably meal . The lozenge keep mouth dissolve . A hot beverage ( e.g . tea , coffee , milk etc . ) take least half hour medication since elevate temperature inactivate bacteria . Duration treatment The treatment start 4-7 day start chemotherapy conditioning regime HSCT continue till resolution mucositis Day+24 post stem cell infusion which-ever earlier . Efficacy Assessments Clinical activity define reduction incidence severity chemotherapy induce mucositis HSCT patient . Most recent version CTCAE ; clinical score CTC V4.03 ( also outline CTCAE version 3.0 ) use mucositis assessment . Also , WHO Oral Mucositis assessment score record . The study follow primary secondary endpoint : Primary endpoint 1 . Determine incidence grade III IV mucositis patient undergo allogeneic autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation two group . Secondary endpoint 1 . Determine incidence Grade mucositis patient undergo allogenic autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation two group . 2 . Duration time period heal chemotherapy induce oral mucositis . 3 . Determine incidence severity dysphagia requirement IV antibiotic two group Safety Assessments 1 . Medical History 2 . Physical Examination 3 . Vital Signs ( blood pressure , pulse rate respiratory rate ) 4 . Laboratory Examinations 5 . Adverse Events</detailed_description>
