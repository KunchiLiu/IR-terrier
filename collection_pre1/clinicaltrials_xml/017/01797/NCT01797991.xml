	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , unicentric , two-arm , parallel , control , double blind pilot study . The purpose pilot study assess feasibility trial design compare quality life patient take dexamethasone two different way prevent hypersensitivity reaction paclitaxel . Dexamethasone give intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute paclitaxel could improve quality life , could adequately prevent hypersensitivity reaction paclitaxel could reduce adverse effect compare dexamethasone give orally 12 hour 6 hour paclitaxel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To assess feasibility randomize , parallel , two-arm , control double blind trial design compare quality life patient take dexamethasone 20 mg IV 30 minute paclitaxel take standard dose dexamethasone , 20 mg orally 12 hour 6 hour paclitaxel , patient take paclitaxel every two three week minimum two cycle order estimate sample size . Secondary objective : Between two study group , compare : - Quality life first two cycle chemotherapy ; - Efficacy dexamethasone prevent acute hypersensitivity reaction paclitaxel first two cycle chemotherapy ; - Adverse effect associate dexamethasone daily basis first seven day first two cycle chemotherapy . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio one two study group .</detailed_description>
