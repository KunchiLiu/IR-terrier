	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination everolimus , letrozole , metformin help control recurrent progressive endometrial cancer . The safety drug combination also study . Everolimus design block protein inside cancer cell involve cancer growth . Letrozole design block protein make estrogen . This may interfere growth cancer cell . Metformin commonly use control blood sugar level patient diabetes . It design low insulin level , may slow stop growth endometrial cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II , Single-Arm Study RAD001 ( Everolimus ) , Letrozole , Metformin Patients With Advanced Recurrent Endometrial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study already take metformin , take metformin begin regular study cycle ( Cycles 1 beyond ) . This call `` Cycle 0 . '' You take metformin mouth 1 time day Days 1-4 Cycle 0 2 time day ( 12 hour apart ) every day . You take metformin 7-10 day Cycle 0 Cycle 1 begin . If already take metformin , continue regular dose start Day 1 Cycle 1 . If already take metformin dose less 1000mg/day , dose slowly raise study dose course 7-10 day start Cycle 1 . In Cycles 1 beyond , participant take 3 drug time . You take metformin food . Starting Cycle 1 , take everolimus 1 time day mouth time every day . You take either consistently food every day consistently without food every day . Starting Cycle 1 , take letrozole 1 time day mouth time every day . It important take study drug study doctor tell . Do skip dos unless study doctor tell skip dos . If throw take study drug , NOT take another tablet day . Let study doctor know get sick . If forget take study drug one day , take extra dos next day . Call study doctor ask advice . There 4 week cycle ( except Cycle 0 ) . Study Visits : Every cycle ( +/- 10 day ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check hepatitis . After Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 every 3 cycle ( Cycles 9 , 12 , 15 , ) ( +/- 10 day ) : You scan CT scan and/or MRI check status disease . If chest disease , CT scan chest . If disease could felt pelvis begin study , pelvic exam After every cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , ) , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You scan CT scan and/or MRI check status disease . - If chest disease , CT scan chest . Follow-Up : You follow-up visit often doctor think need . At every visit : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may . - If doctor think need , scan CT scan and/or MRI check status disease . - If chest disease , CT scan chest . As often doctor think need , study staff call ask side effect may . These call last 5-10 minute . The amount study drug take time take may change study . This may test result side effect . Your study doctor may also ask stop take study drug short time . If happens , tell safe start take study drug . If study drug stop , may come extra visit clinic safety . If side effect get well stop study drug , study doctor may decide take study . This investigational study . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available treat kidney , breast , pancreatic cancer . Letrozole FDA approve commercially available treat breast cancer ovarian cancer . Metformin FDA approve commercially available treat diabetes . The combination everolimus , metformin , letrozole study treat endometrial cancer investigational . Up 64 patient enrol study . Up 59 may take part MD Anderson . Up 5 patient per site may enrol MD Anderson Cooper Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System Harris Health System .</detailed_description>
