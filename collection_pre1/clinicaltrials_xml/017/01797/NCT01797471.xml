	<brief_summary>The investigator aim evaluate safety deliver one-time single fraction Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose ( LEAD ) radiotherapy follow one day later standard-dose , conventionally fractionate concurrent chemotherapy radiation deliver 6 week patient bulky stage III non-small cell lung cancer set single-arm phase I clinical trial . The investigator hypothesize addition one-time single fraction LEAD radiation safe feasible , result additional toxicity expect standard-dose concurrent chemotherapy radiation alone .</brief_summary>
