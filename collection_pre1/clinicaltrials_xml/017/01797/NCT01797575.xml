	<detailed_description>study design : BD type I II patient ( n=160 ) , depressive mixed episode , therapeutic dos commonly utilized mood stabilize agent ( lithium , anticonvulsant , atypical antipsychotic ) least one month still symptomatic ( MADRAS &gt; 20 ) enrol . Patients randomly assign orally receive one 4 condition : aspirin 1000 mg ( 2 capsule 500 mg ) qam , NAC 1000 mg ( 2 capsule 500 mg ) bid , combine aspirin NAC dose give individually match placebo , add-on medication ongoing treatment regimen , 16-week double-blind trial . After first 8 week double blind treatment , responder keep take study drug , whichever . And non-responders re-randomized one three group study drug n't try yet . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Age 18 65 year 2 . A diagnosis BD type I II accord SCID-I interview ; 3 . Currently depressive mixed episode , base DSM-IV/ SCID-I criterion ; 4 . MADRAS &gt; 20 entry study ; 5 . No CURRENT liver , kidney , heart disease ulcer bleed dyscrasia ; 6 . No HYSTORY kidney dysfunction cardiac problem ; 7 . ON therapeutic dos mood stabilize drug ( lithium , anticonvulsant , atypical antipsychotic ) combination least ONE month . 8 . Allowed psychiatric co-morbid condition , anxiety disorder , PTSD substance use ( long NOT meet abuse dependence criterion accord SCID-I past 2 month ) . Exclusion criterion : 1 . CAN NOT : Anti-inflammatory : NSAIDs : Aspirin ( bufferin , bayer aspirin , ecotrin ) , diflunisal ( dolobid , diflunisal ) , Salsalate ( amigesic , salflex ) , Ibuprofen ( motrin , advil ) , Naproxen ( naprosyn , aleve , midol extend relief ) , Fenoprofen ( nalfon ) , Ketoprofen ( actron ) , dexketoprofen ( ketron D ) , Flurbiprofen ( ansaid ) , Oxaprozin ( daypro ) , Loxoprofen ( loxfen , loxonin ) , Indomethacin ( indocin , indocin SR ) , Sulindac ( clinoril ) , Etodolac ( lodine ) , Ketorolac ( toradol ) , diclofenac ( voltaren , cataflam ) , Nabumetone ( Relafen ) Piroxicam ( feldene ) , Meloxicam ( mobic ) , Tenoxicam ( mobiflex ) , Lornoxicam ( xefo ) , mefenamic acid ( ponstel ) , meclofenamic acid ( meclofenamate sodium ) , celecoxib ( celebrex ) Anticoagulants : Coumadin ( Warfarin ) , Heparin Anti-oxidant agent Fish oil NAC ( N-acetyl cysteine ) 2 . Pregnancy 3 . CAN NOT change dose psychotropic medication trial Procedures use : The study carry outpatient clinic affiliate UT Health Science Center Houston . After sign informed consent , patient submit initially structure psychiatric diagnostic interview ( SCID-I ) confirm psychiatric diagnosis , follow physical examination routine lab ( CBC , liver function test , electrolyte , kidney function test , thyroid function test , urinalysis ) rule relevant medical problem . Physically healthy BD patient psychotropic medication combination enrol randomly assign receive , orally , aspirin 1000 mg qam , NAC 1000 mg bid , combination aspirin 1000 mg qam NAC 1000 mg bid , placebo . The study drug dose remain duration study . Patients mood stabilize agent combination , well psychotropic medication study entry , dose medication change trial . They anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant agent anticoagulant point enrol . If patient decompensate significantly , and/or become acutely suicidal , participation trial terminate . If patient qualify study initially base SCID-I interview , physical examination , routine lab ( CBC , liver function test , electrolyte , kidney function test , thyroid function test , urinalysis ) , currently take approve psychotropic medication combination eligible participate lead-in phase . This phase would start screen visit last approximately 6 8 week depend patient 's mood . During lead-in phase , either PI Co-PI evaluate patient prescribe either Lithium Depakote . The patient monitor treatment phase PI Co-PI return two week evaluation . The evaluation include Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSR-S ) ass risk suicide , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRAS ) ass severity depression UKU side effect rating scale . If patient prescribed lithium , lithium level test . The patient continue follow every two week . At 4 week visit , patient also come evaluation ( CSSR-S MADRAS UKU side effect rating scale ) . At 6 week visit , patient re-evaluated double-blind study trial . If patient adequate dose psychotropic medication least 4 week score great 20 Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , enrol . If meet inclusion criterion week 6 lead-in phase visit , return Week 8 re-evaluated . PI Co-PI continue prescribe psychotropic medication throughout lead-in phase ( 8 week ) trial ( 16 week ) . During lead-in phase participant compensate . They receive voucher park visit . They responsible fill pay prescription lead-in phase trial ( 16 week ) . Upon completion first 8-week double-blind trial , patient respond active medication continue study drug additional 8 week double-blind treatment . The non-responders one study drug re-randomized one three group study receive remain treatment additional 8 week double-blind treatment . Treatment response define improvement MADRS score least 50 % . During first 8-week trial , patient see week 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 8 clinical assessment mood rating . During continuation trial , see week 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 16 . Routine lab ( CBC , liver function test , electrolyte , kidney function test , thyroid function test , urinalysis ) repeat week 8 week 16 . The main outcome measure study score Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale , MADRAS , assess severity depressive symptom . All patient also assess Young Mania Rating Scale , YMRS , assess severity manic symptom . Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar version , severity illness , CGI-S , use measure severity depressive , mania severity overall . And , UKU side-effects scale , assess side effect relate study group treatment . In visit , patient see study psychiatrist research staff complete mood rating MADRAS , YMRS , CGI-BD , UKU side-effects scale . At baseline ( randomization ) , week 8 week 16 blood sample proinflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein , soluble interleukin ( IL ) -2 receptor , IL-6 tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha ) , oxidative stress marker ( superoxide dismutase activity catalase activity , serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substance ( TBARS ) , report elevated BD patient . These blood sample store possible future research biomarkers future genetic study 20 year , use pharmacogenetic research 20 year timeframe . The sample store Wet Lab , double lock -80 degree freezer , BBSB , Department Psychiatry University Texas Health Science Center Houston . ( 1941 East Road , suite # 3170 Houston-TX 77054 ) future use study factor Bipolar Disorder . When ( ) 20 year period end , blood sample destroy . At screen visit , week 8 , week 16 also test Lithium level patient prescribe currently take medication study purpose . This extra test conduct safety patient Lithium level test order PI 's discretion throughout 16 week trial . Risks potential benefit : Aspirin safe medication administration human approve FDA anti-inflammatory analgesic agent . The dose propose study within safety range per medication package . Its side-effect profile overall favorable met widespread use worldwide past decade . The main safety issue relate possibility gastrointestinal complication , rare ( closely monitor weekly biweekly visit study require ) , propensity interfere coagulation cause consequent bleeding ( prevented excluding individual use anticoagulant active bleeding problem ) . There case report small case series non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent suggest worsen depressive symptom relate treatment ( e.g. , indomethacin , ibuprofen , naproxen ) , uncontrolled report individual suffer medical illness ( rheumatologic disease ) . For proposed trial , patient may lithium time start aspirin , exclude individual pre-existing cardiac kidney disease . For patient lithium , carefully monitor serum lithium level every two week course trial . Therefore , dos propose anticipate significant problem relate safety propose intervention . NAC safe compound commonly available utilized over-the-counter . In recent study tolerability excellent main side effect include change energy level , headache , heartburn joint pain Blood Draws : When blood drawn , may minimal discomfort and/or bruise . Infection , excess bleeding , clotting , faint also possible , although unlikely . All usual precaution take prevent possibility risk minimize use trained staff perform blood draw Women Able Become Pregnant : Participation study may involve risk embryo , fetus , unborn child . If subject female able become pregnant , urine pregnancy test perform must negative prior enrol study , subject must agree become pregnant study . Urine pregnancy test perform Screening visit week 8 . The study staff review adequate birth control method subject remind become pregnant study . Appropriate method birth control include : hormonal contraceptive ( birth control pill , patch , implant ) , barrier method ( condom diaphragm spermicidal foam jelly , surgical ( hysterectomy tubal ligation ) intrauterine device ( IUD ) . The subject instruct notify study doctor immediately chance become pregnant . Also , subject breast-feeding infant plan breast-feeding infant , must notify study doctor . It known drug excrete human milk ; therefore , breast-feeding permit study Subjects carefully monitor . If subject 's condition worsen point he/she might become suicidal severely depressed , terminate subject 's participation study refer his/her psychiatrist psychiatric treatment . Breach Confidentiality : Every effort make protect subject identity information study . All lab work scan report de-identified medical record protect . However , small chance subject information may view someone involve research study . The study drug must take person prescribed , must keep reach child person limited capacity read understand . By share sample study doctor , risk possible loss subject privacy . Although identifiable ( name , address , etc . ) information share others outside research project . The clinical information obtain subject part medical record maintain UT Center Excellence Mood Disorders , Department Psychiatry UTHSC-H , facility adequate safeguard protection confidentiality . The research data collect recorded use arbitrary code number identification , order safeguard confidentiality . All data keep secure area . Only member UT Center Excellence Mood Disorders research group , get approval CPHS , access data file , master list code . For publication purpose , patient designate assigned code . These blood sample , use pharmacogenetic research 15 year timeframe , sample store Wet Lab , double lock -80 degree freezer , BBSB , Department Psychiatry University Texas Health Science Center Houston . ( 1941 East Road , suite # 3170 Houston-TX 77054 ) The possibility exist subject information may take used reason outside project . The United States ' Genetic Information Nondiscrimination , Act ( GINA ) 2008 , allow employer health insurance company discriminate research subject base his/her genetic information . This mean health insurance company employers NOT ALLOWED BY LAW ask use subject genetic information ( DNA , RNA , etc . ) gain test make decision affect subject hisher family 's health coverage income negative way Importance knowledge may reasonably expect result : The study examine possible novel mechanism action modulation inflammatory mechanism oxidative stress could result development novel , low cost , safe widely available treatment BD patient respond commonly utilized alternative</detailed_description>
