	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . Subject legal guardian willing able sign inform consent prior study initiation . 2 . Subject able participate duration evaluation . In instance , length study exceed twentyfour hour . 3 . Subject satisfies specify sensor requirement ( see Table 1 ) . 4 . Requires use intraarterial line medical reason continuous blood pressure monitor frequent arterial blood draw . 5 . Subject able accommodate multiple sensor . 6 . Neonatal subject 1 month age Pediatric subject 1 month 18 year old . 1 . Subjects exist health condition , investigator determine safe accurate oximetry measure may obtain area pulse oximetry sensor could place , include study . For example , anyone burn , abrasion surface lesion contact area would exclude . 2 . Any subject whose treatment condition would compromise participate study patient whose use pulse oximeter sensor would present potential serious risk health , safety , welfare . 3 . Subject severe contact allergy may react standard adhesive material find pulse oximetry sensor . 4 . Subject reliably monitor pulse oximeter result inadequate pulsatile signal . 5 . Subject procedure use injected intravascular dye within 24 hour precede test</criteria>
