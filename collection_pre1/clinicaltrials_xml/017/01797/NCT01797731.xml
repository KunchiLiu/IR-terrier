	<brief_summary>This randomize , control , blind prospective study compare use usual cut guide palm-sized digital surgical navigation system unilateral total knee arthroplasty . Analysis pre- post-operative X-rays use compare alignment tibial ( shinbone ) implant component . The investigator expect FDA-approved hand-held surgical navigation device increase accuracy precision tibial cut tell surgeon exact position cut block surgeon make cut , allow minor adjustment make . The investigator expect conventional device take less time use , difference decrease surgeon become familiar device . The investigator expect intraoperative measurement acquire KneeAlign system strongly correlate radiographic alignment measure postoperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional Alignment System Versus Surgical Navigation System Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical record , private office chart , electronic medical record utilized co-investigators review data patient fit previously state inclusion criterion . Demographic data include age , gender , height ( cm ) , weight ( kg ) collect . Preoperative , stand anteroposterior hip-to-ankle radiograph measure low extremity mechanical axis , tibiofemoral anatomic alignment , distal femoral proximal tibial anatomic angle . Intraoperative time measurement use conventional extramedullary alignment guide , KneeAlignTM system measure record . The time require utilize alignment guide measure second , start time surgeon hand alignment guide ( KneeAlignTM conventional , extramedullary ) , time surgeon hand oscillate saw make tibial cut . Of note , intraoperative alignment measurement require recorded conventional , extramedullary system , intraoperative alignment report KneeAlignTM system record KneeAlignTM device use . In addition , regard use conventional , extramedullary tibial guide , surgeon utilize guide ( regardless manufacturer ) currently use frequently perform total knee arthroplasty . While may minimal difference regard surgeon 's conventional guide , essentially regard utilize extramedullary rod alignment tibial resection . Currently , total knee replacement require average tourniquet time 30-50 minute depend surgeon . We estimate approximate increase total tourniquet time 5-6 minute use hand-held surgical navigation system . For procedure ( either KneeAlignTM conventional , extramedullary guide ) , make initial cut , point procedure surgeon re-cuts tibia , ask series question postoperatively re-cut tibia part data collection . These question include : 1 . Did re-cut tibia think varus valgus require ? 2 . Did re-cut tibia increase decrease posterior slope ? 3 . Did re-cut tibia increase amount bone resect ? 4 . Were happy overall tibial alignment ? Postoperative radiograph obtain part surgeon 's postoperative protocol , include stand anteroposterior hip-to-ankle radiograph stand lateral knee-to-ankle radiograph , low extremity mechanical axis , tibiofemoral anatomic alignment , tibial component mechanical alignment , tibial component posterior slope measure . This study potential provide significant information regard clinical accuracy precision KneeAlignTM system compare conventional , extramedullary alignment system . If mechanical tibial mechanical alignment significantly improve use KneeAlignTM system , may encourage surgeon utilize device improve postoperative alignment total knee arthroplasty . In addition , surgeon 's may find type hand-held system user-friendly ( contrast large console , computer-assisted surgical system ) , may stimulate future investigation similar device femoral component alignment , also total hip arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
