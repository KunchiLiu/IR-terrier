	<brief_title>A Comparison Metabolic Effects Fructose , Glucose , High Fructose Corn Syrup Sucrose Normal Population Consumed Levels Adults Aged 20-60 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fructose know metabolize differently common monosaccharide . In addition well know lipogenic effect , recent evidence show acute change hormone metabolic parameter control appetite energy regulation fructose consumption may promote caloric overconsumption , long-term , weight gain . However , fructose rarely consume isolation , instead consume combination sugar ( glucose case two common source fructose : high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) sucrose , part mixed macronutrient meal . As , practical significance short-term finding isolate monosaccharide consumption limit . AIM 1 : investigate response ten week daily consumption different fructose contain sugar glucose typical intake level various metabolic parameter fat content liver skeletal muscle . AIM 2 : To investigate whether ten week daily consumption change acute metabolic response sugar consume part mixed nutrient meal .</detailed_description>
