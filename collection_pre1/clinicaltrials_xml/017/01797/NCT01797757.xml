	<brief_summary>A potential application unstructured monoacylglycerol ( MAG ) contain long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LC-PUFA ) provide essential fatty acid human chronically consume lipase inhibitor Orlistat® weigh lower reason . Indeed , predictable chronic consumption Orlistat® lead depletion essential fatty acid time , therefore unstructured MAG contain LC-PUFA option source LC-PUFA patient Orlistat® treatment hypothetically subject type maldigestion/malabsorption . Potential application concept therefore related disease condition comprise low lipid digestion due lipase activity insufficiency . In present study , order see response information eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) delivery , EPA provide either mixture free monoacylglycerols triacylglycerol ( TAG ) . The erythrocyte plasma fatty acid composition subject Orlistat® consumption analyze .</brief_summary>
