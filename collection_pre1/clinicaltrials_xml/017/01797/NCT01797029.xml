	<brief_summary>This single center , multi-site , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled trial clinical efficacy trivalent Serum Institute India , Ltd. ( SIIL ) live-attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) vaccine among child age 24 59 month Bangladesh . Background : 1 . Burden : Within Bangladesh , community- base influenza surveillance identify 84.5 cases/1000 children-years among child &lt; 5 year , 10 % clinical pneumonia case influenza positive age group . 2 . Knowledge gap : There never randomize clinical efficacy trial SIIL LAIV vaccine conduct among child low-income country . 3 . Relevance : Another LAIV vaccine ( make MedImmune ) show high efficacy laboratory-confirmed influenza among child . The SIIL LAIV potential inexpensive intervention prevent pediatric influenza disease . Primary Hypothesis : In child age 24 59 month Bangladesh , LAIV efficacious reduce rate symptomatic , laboratory-confirmed influenza ( vaccine-matched strain ) among child vaccinate LAIV compare child vaccinate placebo first influenza season follow vaccination . Primary Objective : To determine efficacy LAIV reduce rate symptomatic , laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection ( vaccine-matched strain ) among child receive LAIV compare child receive placebo first influenza season follow vaccination ( December 2013 ) . Methods : A total 1761 child enrol randomized 2:1 ratio LAIV placebo begin March 2013 . After vaccination , child evaluate reaction one home visit four day post vaccination . Subsequently , child monitor weekly safety outcome illness sign weekly field worker home visit December 2013 . An extended surveillance period add study , participant consent additional follow-up , surveillance extend second season ( September 2014 ) . Participants illness sign refer study clinic evaluation use standardize diagnostic criterion treatment study physician . Children meet protocol-defined clinical Specimen Collection Criteria nasopharyngeal wash specimen collect . Clinical specimen test Real time polymerase chain reaction ( rRT-PCR ) evidence influenza virus infection . Primary Outcome measures/variables : Vaccine efficacy assess symptomatic , laboratory-confirmed influenza circulate virus strain .</brief_summary>
