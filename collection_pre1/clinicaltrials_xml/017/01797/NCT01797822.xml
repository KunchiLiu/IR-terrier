	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether , people dry eye syndrome , counter artificial tear prescription eye drop , dexamethasone , change effect eye response low humidity environment . It known irritation dry eye improve counter artificial tear wet lubricate eye . The prescription eye drop , dexamethasone , also improve eye irritation decrease inflammation develop dry eye . Thus , investigator hypothesize use conventional dry eye treatment improve eye ' response low humidity environment .</brief_summary>
