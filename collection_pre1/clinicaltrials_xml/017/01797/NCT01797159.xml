	<brief_summary>The Investigators look compare standard treatment management small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) prophylactic cranial Irradiation ( PCI ) ( show good patient survival ) cranial spar PCI . Although standard care PCI successful patient survival also neurologic side-effects . The Investigators hop cranial spar PCI positive survival result add benefit lower neurological side-effects .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hippocampal Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>-The standard care management small cell lung cancer consist chemotherapy plus thoracic radiation follow prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) base randomize trial demonstrate significant improvement overall survival ( OS ) PCI . Unfortunately radiation therapy brain associate neurocognitive toxicity , may least part relate radiation induced injury neural progenitor cell hippocampus . Both human animal data suggest inverse relationship radiation dose hippocampus performance neuropsychological testing . We hypothesize hippocampal spar PCI allow improved performance test short term memory executive function compare historical control ( RTOG 0212 ) receive dose conventional PCI . The primary objective study evaluate performance Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delay recall 6 month follow hippocampal-sparing PCI relative historical control . Secondary objective estimate : 1 ) composite cognitive function follow hippocampal-sparing PCI relative historical control 2 ) rate metastasis hippocampus 2 year follow hippocampal-sparing PCI . The long term goal research reduce long term sequela radiation therapy primary metastatic brain tumor .</detailed_description>

Patients epilepsy require permanent oral medication _ Patients must serious medical psychiatric illness would , opinion investigator , prevent inform consent completion protocol treatment , and/or followup visit . Patients may take Memantine . This eligibility criterion add RTOG 0212 , since physician might prescribe Memantine . This medication would give time enrollment RTOG 0212 administration could confound result study .</criteria>
