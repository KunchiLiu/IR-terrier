The definition nonradical resection follow : Liver tumor rupture adjacent organ invasion , confirm intraoperative postoperative pathology ; Positive resection margin , confirm post operative pathology ; Lymph node metastasis confirm intraoperative post operative pathology ; Residue lesion confirm postoperative digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) ; Macroscopic/microscopic tumor thrombus vein and/or bile duct , confirm intraoperative / postoperative pathology ; Number tumor &gt; =3 , confirm preoperative radiographic inspection ( CT , MRI BUS ) , intraoperative BUS , postoperative pathology . AFP alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) remain high Upper Limits Normal ( accord local lab 's range ) , confirm local laboratory test least 2 month surgery . Confirmation complete response ( visible residual tumor ) , eligibility scan ( CT MRI ) local radiological review , perform &gt; 2 week surgery ; Patients must follow regularly surgery ( time interval method base physician 's daily practice ) , document tumor recurrence eligibility scan ( CT MRI ) Sorafenib treatment ; Patients must physically/mentally recover surgery consider able tolerant Sorafenib therapy , investigator 's judgment ; The approved local product label must follow exclusion criterion</criteria>
