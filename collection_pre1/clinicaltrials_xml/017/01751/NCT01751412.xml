	<brief_summary>This research study Pilot Study . Pilot study conduct see practical type research large scale future . The pilot part study ass possibility use proton radiation treat lymphoma . Proton radiation use many type malignancy , use treatment lymphoma limit . The treatment still study research doctor try find use treatment different type lymphoma . Proton beam radiation therapy FDA approve radiation delivery system . Patients ask participate research study lymphoma center chest , near heart . Conventional radiation therapy photon use standard treatment many patient lymphoma . In research study investigator look another type radiation call proton radiation , know spare surround tissue organ radiation . Proton radiation delivers radiation area require radiation delivers dose beyond region require treatment . This may reduce side effect patient would normally experience conventional radiation therapy mean deliver proton radiation therapy . In research study , investigator evaluate effectiveness use proton radiation deliver reduce side effect associate radiation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If person agree participate research study , ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligibility . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn patient take part research study . If patient test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , performance status , physical examination , assessment tumor , echocardiogram , electrocardiogram , pulmonary ( lung ) function test blood test . If test show patient eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If patient meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Proton radiation deliver daily 2 5 week , depend dose prescribed physician . Treatment deliver ( Monday-Friday ) 5 day ( weekend holiday ) . Each treatment require lie table 30 45 minute . Participants receive radiation therapy outpatient Massachusetts General Hospital . During radiation therapy , follow weekly assessment procedure : physical exam , assess side effect , blood test cardiac marker . Study participant ask return follow visit 6-12 week last dose radiation therapy . During visit follow test procedure do : PET/CT scan , physical exam , assess side effect blood test cardiac marker . Participants also ask return follow-up visit 6 month , 12 month annually five year post radiation . Keeping touch study participant check condition help investigator look long-term effect research study . At visit , follow test procedure do : physical exam , assess side effect , ECG , ECHO , pulmonary test , PET/CT scan , routine blood test blood test cardiac marker ( 6 month 1 year ) .</detailed_description>
