	<brief_title>Family-mismatched/Haploidentical Donors Versus Matched Unrelated Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient lack HLA-identical sibling , 8/8-matched unrelated donor currently `` gold standard '' donor , since outcomes HLA-identical sibling compare 8/8-matched unrelated donor . Currently , three alternative graft source , include mismatch unrelated donor , familial mismatch/haploidentical donor , umbilical cord blood . Compared source , transplant familial mismatch/haploidentical donor ( FMT ) benefit immediate availability donor , particularly patient urgently need transplantation . Initial report characterize FMT poor engraftment high incidence graft-versus-host disease . However , outcome FMT significantly improve past decade optimization condition regimen graft selection allow stable engraftment across major HLA barrier , promise leukemia-free survival adult acute leukemia . Despite encouraging result potential benefit FMT , study compare clinical outcome FMT donor type , particularly acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) single disease . Since August 2008 , continuously perform FMT use unmanipulated donor cell less aggressive condition regimen high-risk AML lack HLA-identical sibling , 8/8 7/8-matched unrelated donor . We report feasibility FMT use novel reduced-intensity regimen without ex vivo T-cell depletion , show early result similar outcome transplant 8/8-matched unrelated donor ( MUT ) . This study test hypothesis overall survival 3 year FMT similar overall survival MUT .</detailed_description>
