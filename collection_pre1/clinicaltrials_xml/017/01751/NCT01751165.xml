	<criteria>Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol . A male female age 50 year old time first vaccination . Written inform consent obtain subject . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period two month completion vaccination series . Use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine , plan use study period . Chronic administration immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within six month prior first vaccine dose . For corticosteroid , prednisone dose &lt; 20 mg/day , equivalent , allow . Inhaled , topical intraarticular corticosteroid allow . Administration plan administration live vaccine period start 30 day end 30 day either dose study vaccine . Administration plan administration nonreplicating vaccine within eight day prior within 14 day either dose study vaccine . Administration longacting immunemodifying drug ( e.g . infliximab ) within six month prior first vaccine dose expect administration time study period . Previous vaccination varicella HZ ( either register product participation previous vaccine study ) . Planned administration study HZ varicella vaccine ( include investigational nonregistered vaccine ) study vaccine . History HZ . History reaction hypersensitivity likely exacerbate component vaccine ( ) . Any confirm suspect immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition result disease ( e.g . malignancy , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] infection ) immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy ( e.g . medication use cancer chemotherapy , organ transplantation treat autoimmune disorder ) . Acute disease and/or fever time enrolment . Fever define temperature ≥ 37.5°C ( 99.5°F ) oral , axillary tympanic route , ≥ 38.0°C ( 100.4°F ) rectal route . The preferred route record temperature study oral . Subjects minor illness ( mild diarrhoea , mild upper respiratory infection ) without fever may enrol discretion investigator .
