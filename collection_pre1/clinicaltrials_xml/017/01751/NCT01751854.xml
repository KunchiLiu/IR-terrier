	<brief_summary>The information derive study critical establish appropriate rehabilitative intervention post-stroke . In particular , traditional use pharmacological agent alter motor function post-stroke direct primarily reduce `` positive '' sign follow upper motor neuron lesion , particular spasticity , enhance , velocity-dependent stretch reflex response impose stretch . While pharmacological management spasticity certainly suppress clinical quantitative measure hypertonia , little improvement functional performance . In contrast , preliminary data administration 5HT agent follow neurological injury indicate increase motor performance ( Pariente 2001 ) recovery ( Dam 1996 ) , despite increase spastic motor activity ( Stolp-Smith 1999 ; see Preliminary Data ) . Understanding method maximize function follow stroke despite potential , short-term increase spastic motor activity may improve therapeutic intervention strategy . The general objective study therefore : 1. quantify effect short-term SSRI administration voluntary spastic motor behavior individual chronic spastic hemiparesis , 2. identify change impairments functional recovery walk ability BWSTT presence absence SSRIs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Walking ability post-stroke characterize primarily reduce walk speed endurance impair postural stability limit functional societal reintegration . Decreased ground walk speed result decrease cadence , decrease stride length increase non-paretic single limb stance duration . Mechanisms underlie reduce velocity think include weakness paretic limb , particular hip flexor plantarflexor strength , may also link spastic motor behavior loss inter- intra-limb coordination . Rehabilitation effort improve strength muscle coordination pattern hemiparetic gait may improve gait quality velocity therefore improve performance activity daily live . To improve gait performance functional outcome follow neurological injury , rehabilitation effort focus re-establishing normal walking pattern . Towards end , use body-weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) demonstrate significant improvement walk capability individual post-stroke spinal cord injury . By support portion subject 's body weight treadmill provide manual facilitation therapist , previous research demonstrate improvement temporal-spatial gait pattern , include gait velocity , endurance ( Macko 2005 ) , balance , symmetry . Importantly , change impairments functional limitation observe intensive BWSTT often great achieve conventional low intensity physical therapy . Given benefit , particularly require substantial walk assistance follow stroke various robotic locomotor retrain device develop facilitate practice `` kinematically correct '' step pattern improve consistency duration treadmill train . While change observe follow BWSTT statistically functionally significant , remain unclear benefit intensive train paradigms optimize . Specifically , across many large study subject chronic stroke ( i.e. , &gt; 6 mo . post-injury ) , mean increase walk speed range 0.09 m/s 0.15 m/s follow 1-6 mo . training . Even current trial investigate change ground walk speed robotic- vs. therapist-assisted BWSTT , mean improvement least 18 subject group vary 0.07 0.13 m/s , respectively ( please see Preliminary work : Pilot Study 1 ) . While statistically significant , change represent approximate 10 % improvement gait speed compare healthy adult ( Perry 1992 ) . To enhance benefit intensive BWSTT , many investigator continue search combine intervention augment recovery . One potential adjunct receive attention use pharmacological agent . For example , anti-spastic medication ( e.g. , benzodiazepine , baclofen , tizanidine ) use decade ( reduce presence severity involuntary , spastic reflex patient stroke . Spasticity traditionally think primary limitation functional mobility post-stroke , although premise question recently . Indeed , many pharmacological agent effective reduce spastic motor behavior although evidence improvement function follow use agent post-stroke limited . In addition , evidence suggest agent reduce maximal voluntary strength impair learn motor task . New evidence emerge potentially powerful role excitatory facilitative modulatory agent treatment motor impairment post-stroke . Based primarily evidence experimentally induced lesion mammal , application monoaminergic ( i.e. , serotonin [ 5HT ] norepinephrine [ NE ] ) agents excite vs. depress spinal cortical excitability gain momentum . In individual post-stroke , example , use amphetamine ( direct primarily NE pathway ) generate substantial interest adjunct physical therapy intervention , although recent data may suggest benefit agent . Further , use amphetamine may enhance risk cerebral coronary vascular disease , already compromise patient population , therefore limit use agent clinical practice . In contrast , 5HT agent also show enhance spinal and/or cortical excitability , may accelerate locomotor recovery follow neurological injury appropriate physical intervention provide . In human post-stroke , one study demonstrate enhanced motor performance cortical activity follow single dose SSRIs . In another study sub-acute stroke , SSRIs selective NE reuptake inhibitor improve function inpatient rehabilitation . Interestingly , small case report indicate strong increase spasticity follow use 5HTergic anti-depressive agent , indicate spinal cortical excitability may contribute altered motor function . Such finding replicate ( please see Preliminary work : Pilot Study I , although certainly require assessment . While finding preliminary , two important question arise . First , spastic voluntary low extremity activity simultaneously alter follow administration commonly use anti-depressive medication , relation variable alter motor function ? Echoing tothers , important prevalence spasticity impair motor function post-stroke ? Secondly , increase excitability spinal cortical system follow SSRI accelerate motor recovery effectiveness intensive physical rehabilitation strategy , show reduced preparation ? Such data important health care professional treat individual neurological injury : A ) understand previously unknown modulation reflex voluntary function follow seemingly innocuous agent ; , B ) provide optimal neural excitability accelerate motor performance recovery post-injury .</detailed_description>
