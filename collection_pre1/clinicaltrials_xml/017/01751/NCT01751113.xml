	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect lung function combination ADOAIR 50/250mcg twice daily plus tiotropium bromide 18mcg daily compare individual treatment ( tiotropium bromide 18mcg daily alone ADOAIR 50/250mcg twice daily alone ) Japanese subject COPD . The study utilize three-way cross-over design 2-week wash-out period 4-week consecutive treatment period . The aim support rationale `` triple combination '' therapy demonstrate treatment ADOAIR tiotropium potentially produce improve , clinically relevant effect compare either treatment alone . This study utilize range lung function measure order fully assess benefit triple therapy . The primary endpoint base airway conductance measure use plethysmography ( sGaw measure 4hours post dose ( AUC 0-4hr ) Day 28 ) . Secondary endpoint include lung function measure base plethysmography spirometry . The lung function measure support measurement use relief salbutamol .</brief_summary>
