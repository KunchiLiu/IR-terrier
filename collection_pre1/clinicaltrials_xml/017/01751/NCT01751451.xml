	<brief_summary>In April 2011 , United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve oral drug abiraterone acetate ( Zytiga ® ) combination prednisone ( steroid ) treat patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receive prior docetaxel ( chemotherapy ) . In December 2012 , FDA approve Zytiga ® combination prednisone treat patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receive prior chemotherapy . Degarelix ( Firmagon ® ) , testosterone lower agent give monthly injection , FDA approve treatment patient advanced prostate cancer . The purpose study evaluate abiraterone acetate prednisone combination degarelix possible treatment PSA recurrent prostate cancer compare abiraterone acetate alone degarelix alone . This first time drug use together .</brief_summary>
