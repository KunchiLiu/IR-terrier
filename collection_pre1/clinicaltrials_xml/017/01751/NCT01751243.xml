	<brief_title>Transplantation Hematopoietic Progenitors From Haploidentical Donor With Selective Vitro Depletion Allo-reactive Lymphocytes Patient With High Risk Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study determine safety transplantation hematopoietic progenitor haploidentical donor vitro allo-depleted lymphocyte infusion . Secondary objective : - To assess immune reconstitution pre post-infusion allo-depleted lymphocyte . - To analyze incidence infection ( CMV aspergillus ) post-transplant . - To analyze impact acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . - To optimize dose allo-depleted lymphocyte reconstitute immune response pathogen without cause GVHD . - To assess rate graft myeloid platelet engraftment time . - To assess rate relapse , event-free survival overall survival . It hop recruit 20 clinically evaluable patient safety purpose . The inclusion period 2 Â½ year . Study duration shall exceed three year inclusion first patient . The minimum follow-up patient 6 month transplantation . The first 5 patient ( group 0 ) receive haploidentical transplantation hematopoietic progenitor without subsequent infusion allo-depleted lymphocyte cohort 3 patient , infuse +4 post-transplant day dos : 1x105 cluster differentiation 3 ( CD3 ) /kg ( group 1 ) , 3x105 CD3/kg ( group 2 ) , 5x105 CD3 / kg ( group 3 ) , 1x106 CD3/kg ( group 4 ) 3x106 CD3/kg ( group 5 ) . Donor : perform one leukapheresis least 30 day ( 4 week ) prior schedule progenitor infusion ( day 0 ) , order obtain effector T cell .</detailed_description>
