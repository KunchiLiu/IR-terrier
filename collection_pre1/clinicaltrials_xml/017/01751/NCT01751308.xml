	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : Phase 1 Part : To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cabazitaxel single agent pediatric participant recurrent refractory solid tumor include tumor central nervous system . Phase 2 Part : To determine objective response rate ( complete partial response ) duration response cabazitaxel single agent participant recurrent refractory high grade glioma ( HGG ) diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) . Secondary Objectives : Phase 1 Part : To characterize safety tolerability cabazitaxel participant recurrent refractory solid tumor include tumor central nervous system . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile cabazitaxel participant recurrent refractory solid tumor include tumor central nervous system . To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity may associate cabazitaxel participant recurrent refractory solid tumor include tumor central nervous system . Phase 2 Part : To characterize safety tolerability cabazitaxel participant recurrent refractory HGG DIPG . To estimate progression free survival participant recurrent refractory HGG DIPG . To estimate overall survival participant recurrent refractory HGG DIPG . To characterize plasma PK profile cabazitaxel participant recurrent refractory HGG DIPG .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Phase 1 Part ( dose escalation ) : Participants histologically confirm solid tumor include tumor central nervous system recurrent refractory effective standard treatment available . All participant must measurable disease . Participants diffuse pontine glioma eligible without biopsy evidence progressive disease post radiation therapy . Phase 2 Part ( safety activity ) : Participants recurrent refractory high grade glioma diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma effective therapy available . All participant must measurable disease . Participants diffuse pontine glioma eligible without biopsy evidence progressive disease post radiation therapy . Participants grade III grade IV glioma must pathologic confirmation either time initial diagnosis time recurrence . Participants age ≥2 year ≤18 year Participants meet body surface area ( BSA ) requirement eligible : 1 . Minimal BSA requirement particular dose level ; 2 . During Phase 1 part participant must BSA &lt; 2.1 m² time enrollment 3 . During Phase 2 part participant BSA ≥2.1 m² eligible , however actual dose cabazitaxel participant adjust maximum dose calculate ( cap ) BSA 2.1 m² Performance status : 1 . Lansky score ≥60 ( participant ≤10 year age ) 2 . Karnofsky score ≥60 % ( participant &gt; 10 year age ) Participants unable walk paralysis , mobile wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Participants must adequate liver , renal marrow function define : 1 . Total bilirubin ≤1.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age 2 . AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 x ULN 3 .

Male female participant reproductive potential must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry , duration study participation 6 month follow last dose cabazitaxel . Written inform consent/assent prior studyspecific procedure . Consent must obtain participant and/or parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) signature least one parent guardian require . Investigators also obtain assent participant accord local , regional national guideline . Participants must recover acute toxic effect prior therapy ≤ grade 1 entering study . Exclusion criterion : Prior treatment within follow timeframes : 1 . Systemic anticancer treatment within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosourea , mitomycin monoclonal antibody include bevacizumab ) 2 . Surgery small field radiation therapy within 4 week 3 . Treatment investigational agent within 4 week within 5 halflives agent , whichever longer Craniospinal large field radiation therapy ( define &gt; 25 % bone marrow irradiate ) within 6 month prior first dose . Prior systemic radioisotope therapy ( include diagnostic imaging radioimmunoconjugates lack myelosuppressive property ) total body irradiation . Prior bone marrow stem cell transplant Participants clinically significant illness , investigator 's opinion , could adequately control appropriate therapy , would compromise participant 's ability tolerate cabazitaxel result inability ass toxicity . This include , limit uncontrolled intercurrent illness include ongoing active infection , cardiac disease , renal impairment , plan surgery psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
