	<brief_title>Improved Accessibility EmONC Services Maternal Newborn Health : Community Based Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deaths birth particularly critical address occur complication childbirth lead emergency situation slim window time intervene . Every year estimate 3.6 million newborn 360,000 mother die globally . Of , maternal health complication contribute 1.5 million neonatal death first week life 1.4 million stillborn neonate , suggest major gap intervention subsist around childbirth early postnatal period , time mother baby risk . While many factor contribute maternal neonatal death , one effective mean solve problem require effective preventive measure treatment provide rapidly woman newborn , often home primary health care setting . It often address overwhelming mortality morbidity closely link number interrelate delays prevent pregnant woman access health care need . Each delay closely related service , logistics , facility condition , important element health . These delay : 1 ) delay seek appropriate medical help obstetric emergency neonatal complication reason cost , lack recognition emergency , poor education , lack access information gender inequality ; 2 ) delay reach appropriate facility reason distance , infrastructure transport ; 3 ) delay receive adequate care facility reach shortage staff , competency , due unavailability require medical facility equipment . As result , many preventable maternal death occur , often resource poor setting , birth home-based event complication woman unable access require care time . While many proven , cost-effective way save live mother , newborn exist , always available need . There bulk literature identify number intervention improve maternal newborn health . The lancet maternal neonatal survival series emphasize model `` Basic essential obstetric care '' one feasible effective strategy reduce maternal mortality . For reason , essential create demand uptake service strengthen primary health care infrastructure community level , improve liaison Lady Health Workers/Traditional Birth Attendants/Community Midwives local district health system early timely referral complicate case sick newborn . While several previous study Pakistan document beneficial impact community-based intervention improve maternal new-born health , evidence require assess effectiveness community-based intervention increase uptake EmONC service reduce delay responsible poor maternal new-born health . Context-specific evidence also need appropriate mix intervention , delivery strategy , task shift share option , functional link assessment primary health care , complementary health system community support demand mechanism . Therefore , main target audience beneficiary project woman usually say decision making choice opt well treatment . The woman usually depend upon decision make husband elder society male dominant . We attempt take care factor maximize uptake intervention service develop community support group . The specific objective study : 1 . To conduct in-depth analysis maternal neonatal health seek pattern behavior target population care provision health facility understand context requirement improve EmONC service delivery . 2 . To provide maternal neonatal health pack ( clean delivery kit , emollient , chlorhexidine , sms health message ) safe motherhood newborn well-being . 3 . To mobilize community creation demand improve MNH service practice community mobilization . 4 . To train implement integrate EmONC package community-level health care provider ( Lady Health Workers , Traditional Birth Attendants , Community Midwives provide antenatal , natal postnatal care service , recognize refer complicated pregnancy childbirth case sick newborn health facility . 5 . To strengthen improve quality care health facility provide EmONC service capacity build health care provider .</detailed_description>
