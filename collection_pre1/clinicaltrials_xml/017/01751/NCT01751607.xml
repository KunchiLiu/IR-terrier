	<brief_title>Determining Association Chromosomal Variants With Non-PV Triggers Ablation-outcome AF ( DECAF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : This prospective pilot study aim examine association specific genetic variant ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) namely rs2200733 , rs6843082 , rs10033464 , rs17042171 , rs2106261 rs13376333 chromosome 1 , 4 16 , presence non-pulmonary vein trigger ( NPVT ) well ablation-outcome AF patient . Hypothesis : Genetic variant predict prevalence non-PV trigger well long-term procedure-outcome . Background : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common clinical arrhythmia affect nearly 3.0 million people United States . Its significant contribution population morbidity mortality amplify fact AF associate 3-5 fold increase prevalence cerebrovascular stroke 2-fold increase risk death . Limited efficacy available therapeutic strategy make matter bad ; failure attribute lack clear-understanding pathophysiology complex arrhythmia . In addition traditional risk factor include advance age , obesity , metabolic syndrome , ischemic/valvular heart disease hyperthyroidism etc predict occurrence AF , genetic predisposition AF report recent year . Common AF often occur structural heart diseases individual cardiac pathology develop AF , indicate must genetic factor predispose individual AF . In 2007 , first Genome wide association study ( GWAS ) AF subject European descent report investigator Iceland . Two common variant chromosome 4q25 find strongly associate AF . Following initial report , several research group provide independent replication analysis . So far , least three distinct genomic locus , 4q25 , 16q22 , 1q21 strong association AF . Although SNP generally sufficient cause AF , may act combination SNPs pathological condition ( e.g. , ischemia stretch ) increase susceptibility AF may regulatory role expression nearby gene potential candidate gene AF . Recent GWAS finding leave u promise novel molecular pathway AF provide start point dissection novel pathway relate AF . However , majority study replicate independent population different ethnic group none molecular pathway SNPs lead AF definitively determine . A good understanding characterization genetic variant associate AF general population would facilitate new approach diagnosis efficient treatment arrhythmia . On hand , catheter ablation become establish invasive procedure treat patient AF offer promise free patient symptoms well eliminate need use chronic drug therapy agent sometimes significant risk , cost , inconvenience patient . However , despite rapid progress technique past decade , success rate outcome AF ablation remain suboptimal largely variable depend case volume ablation strategy use individual center . Many risk factor associate procedural failure arrhythmia recurrence AF ablation , include type AF , size leave atrium , cycle length AF , etc . Recently , demonstrate presence NPVT strongly predict failure AF ablation elimination NPVTs procedure significantly improve long term freedom arrhythmia ablation AF type . Non-PV trigger define ectopic trigger originate site pulmonary vein leave atrial posterior wall , superior vena cava , leave atrial appendage , ligament Marshall coronary sinus . Lately , publish research show certain common genetic variant different chromosome associate increase risk AF , also response AF treatment prognosis AF patient . As observed high incidence NPVTs AF patient role determine AF ablation outcome , hypothesize common genetic variant different chromosomal locus associate occurrence NPVTs , subsequently predispose development AF influence response management . Study Design : This prospective pilot study enroll 400 consecutive AF patient undergo catheter ablation . Baseline blood sample collect patient genetic analysis . Quality Life ( QoL ) survey conduct baseline 1-year follow-up . All patient follow recurrence one year . The study conduct collaboration Dr. V. Iyer , professor University Texas Austin . All genetic analysis perform UT core facility . Primary endpoint : Association SNPs non-PV trigger consider primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint : 1 . Association SNPs leave atrial scar 2 . Association SNPs non-PV trigger stratify AF type ; paroxysmal ( PAF ) non-paroxysmal AF ( NPAF ) 3. association SNPs arrhythmia recurrence Study Procedure : 1 ml whole blood collect patient 4 ml Sodium-heparin tube ablation procedure . The blood sample label anonymous patient identifier identify research staff . Following collection , blood sample store -200 C clinical lab St. David 's Medical Center transfer ( twice weekly nitrogen bucket ) lab Dr. V. Iyer ( Molecular Genetics Microbiology , UT Austin ) store -70 degree C freezer end study , sample simultaneously analyze . Genomic DNA purification SNP analysis Taqman assay perform sample end study , UT facility . DNA purification protocol : Qiagen QiaAMP 96 well blood kit use lyse white blood cell purify genomic DNA . Overview procedure use TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays : Purified DNA sample use TaqMan qPCR assay . Briefly , small quantity sample DNA add six well 384 well qPCR plate . Next , Taqman fluorescent label probe add well . Lastly , TaqMan master mix put well . This qPCR plate run Life Technologies ViiA7 real-time qPCR machine . To detect presence absence SNP patient , plate reader use detect fluorescence well . Ablation procedure : Standard map ablation procedure perform discretion physician . Follow-up : Following ablation , patient discharge previously ineffective AADs continue 90 day ( blank period ) . The blanking period allow time inflammatory process subside . AADs discontinue blanking period patient . If patient suffers recurrence atrial arrhythmia , AAD therapy may administer discretion physician . All patient followed-up minimum 1 year follow PVAI . Recurrence assess event record 5 month Holter monitor 1 , 3 , 6 12 month . Recurrence define freedom atrial flutter ( AFL ) , AF atrial tachycardia ( AT ) &gt; 30 second duration , absence anti-arrhythmic drug ( AADs ) follow-up . Risk Analysis : This study pose additional risk patient . The risk standard AF ablation . Minor risk associate venous blood draw may include faint bruising , pain discomfort 1/1000 risk infection site blood drawn . Benefits : The subject may incur benefit participate study . Potential benefit future patient : This information enrich knowledge molecular mechanism AF help develop personalized ablation strategy future patient would effective eliminate arrhythmia . Statistical Methodology : Sampling Plan : Consecutive eligible patient approach enrollment . Analysis Plan : Continuous variable report mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . The categorical variable report frequency percentage . Data analysis perform use unpaired Student 's t-test continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . For genotype-rhythm outcome correlation , 3 different model apply . The variant allele assume either dominant recessive additive effect model . In dominant model , identical effect expect heterozygous homozygous variant carrier . In recessive model , effect see homozygous variant carrier . Lastly , additive model , heterozygous variant carrier assume intermediate effect compare homozygote . Multivariate regression analysis perform use Cox proportional hazard model test association SNPs prevalence non-PV trigger outcome variable . SAS 9.2 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC ) use statistical analysis</detailed_description>
