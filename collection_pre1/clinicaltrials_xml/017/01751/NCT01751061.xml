	<brief_title>Improving Decision Making Patients With Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The process make decision whether provide prolong life support seriously deficient among clinician surrogate decision maker critically ill patient . To address problem , propose randomize , control trial determine innovative web-based decision aid compare usual care control improve quality decision making ( define clinician-surrogate concordance prognosis , quality communication , medical comprehension ) , reduce surrogate ' psychological distress ( depression , anxiety , post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder ( PTSD ) symptom ) , reduce patient ' health care cost 6-month follow . We enroll 410 surrogate decision maker 273 patient ( expect average 1.5 surrogate per patient ) . This study potential improve clinician surrogates interact intensive care unit increase likelihood life support decision align patient ' value .</detailed_description>
