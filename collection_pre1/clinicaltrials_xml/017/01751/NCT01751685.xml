	<brief_title>Study Hyperkyphosis , Exercise Function-SHEAF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental intervention provide small group meet three session per week 6 month . At baseline 6 month intervention , measure kyphosis , physical function , spine muscle strength density , quality life . We assess effect intervention co-primary outcome kyphosis , modify Physical Performance Test ( PPT ) gait speed measure change 6 month . We also assess effect intervention secondary outcomes physical function health-related quality life , measure change Timed Up Go , Timed Loaded Standing , Six-Minute Timed Walk , Scoliosis Research Society SRS-30 , PROMISe Global Health physical function PACE questionnaires . Furthermore , investigate whether change kyphosis , spinal muscle strength and/or density mediate effect intervention change physical function . After 6-month intervention , group continue usual activity ass durability effect intervention 1-year follow-up .</detailed_description>
