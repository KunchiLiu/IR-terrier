	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess accuracy two continuous glucose monitoring device ( Dexcom G4 Platinum Medtronic Enlite system ) patient type 1 diabetes mellitus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standardized Procedure Assessment New-to-market Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study use two CE mark Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) system ; Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM CE-marked 2012 ( Dexcom , USA ) Medtronic Paradigm Veo system Enlite Sensor CE-marked 2011 ( Medtronic , USA ) . Both Dexcom G4 Platinum Medtronic Enlite sensor obtain normal commercial channel rather directly manufacturer . The two CGM sensor wear concomitantly participant visit Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) . This visit duration 6 hour . Blood drawn determination glucose level . The patient receive usual breakfast increase insulin bolus ( 180 % patient 's calculated mealtime dose ) administer correct breakfast glucose excursion aim induce period minor hypoglycaemia . Blood sample continue end admission . At end CRC part , patient continue wear two sensor home . In case sensor failure CRC session third day study , patient instruct insert new sensor per manufacturer 's instruction use notify study coordinator event . Sensors worn end six day study duration . Patients ask perform least 6 fingersticks per day blood glucose measurement study glucometer . The study end 6th day initial sensor insertion . Patients return CRC sensor remove CGM sensor blood glucometer data download device . In case failure sensor CRC session schedule six day study duration , patient return CRC sensor removal data download .</detailed_description>
