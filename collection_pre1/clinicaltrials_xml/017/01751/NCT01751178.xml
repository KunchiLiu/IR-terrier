	<criteria>Good general health ( opinion investigator ) clinically significant relevant abnormality medical history oral/ dental examination . 5. ) Good oral health opinion investigator ( allow mild moderate gingivitis meet entry criterion ) . b ) A minimum 20 permanent gradable teeth screening . ( Gradable teeth restorative material cover less 25 % tooth surface grade ) . c ) Mild moderate gingivitis present screen visit opinion investigator . ) Positive response bleed brush exercise screen visit . e ) A total 20 bleeding site great baseline visit . Known suspected intolerance hypersensitivity Chlorhexidine study material ( closely relate compound ) state ingredient . 5. ) Current relevant history serious , severe unstable physical psychiatric illness medical condition ( e.g . Diabetes Mellitus ) would make subject unlikely fully complete study increase risk subject undermines data validity . b ) Subjects require prophylactic antibiotic treatment prior dental therapy . c ) Use concomitant medication , opinion investigator , might interfere outcome study increase risk subject ( eg : phenytoin , calcium antagonist , cyclosporine , warfarin , antibiotic , immunosuppressant ) . ) Use antibiotic within two week prior screen visit throughout study . e ) Use systemic medication would effect gingival condition within 14 day gingival examination ( eg : ibuprofen aspirin therapy ) 6. ) Have current active caries b ) More 3 pocket 5mm . c ) Excessive calculus present interferes probe examination Gingival Index . ) Other severe oral/ gingival condition ( e.g . Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis ) may compromise study subject opinion investigator gingivitis examiner . e ) Medical condition may directly influence gingival bleeding . f ) Restorations poor state repair . g ) Orthodontic appliance anterior cosmetic restoration veneer . h ) Enamel pitting/irregularities . 7 .
