	<brief_summary>This 2 part study . The goal first part clinical research study find high tolerable dose ruxolitinib give TKI already take ( gleevec , sprycel , nilotinib ) part standard care treatment . The goal second part study learn drug combination help control CML . Although good response therapy , disease still detectable low level ( call `` minimal residual disease '' ) . Researchers believe eliminate detectable evidence disease may decrease chance leukemia ever come back . The safety drug combination also study part . Ruxolitinib design block protein call Jak2 may help keep leukemia cell alive even TKI therapy . Blocking protein may cause cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML ) With Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , continue receive TKI dose receive last 6 month . You also receive ruxolitinib mouth 1 2 time daily . The dose level often take drug depend enter study . The study staff give detailed instruction often take drug vomit miss dose study drug . In first part study , assign dose level ruxolitinib base join study . Up 3 dose level ruxolitinib test . At least 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose ruxolitinib find . This call Dose Escalation Group . After high tolerate dose found , extra 30 participant receive ruxolitinib dose level . This call Dose Expansion Group . Study Visits : At every visit , ask side effect may list drug may take . Every 1-2 week 8 week , Month 3 ( +/- 3 week ) every 3 month , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test test kidney liver function . Every month first 3 month , every 3-6 month first year , every 6-12 month , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn molecular testing . Every 3-6 month first year , every 6-12 month bone marrow aspirate check status disease . At Weeks 1 ( +/- 3 day ) 4 ( +/- 1 week ) , Months 3 6 ( +/- 1 month ) , every 6-12 month , complete physical exam . If study doctor decide best interest , may able stop take study drug and/or TKI . If stop study drug and/or TKI , every 4 week first 6 month stop treatment , every 3 month next 12 month , every 6 month , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn molecular testing . Your doctor discus . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 2 year long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visits : After last dose study drug , call come clinic within 30 day ask side effect and/or symptom may . If contact phone , call last 2-3 minute . This investigational study . TKIs approve treatment CML give part standard care , even participate study . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient myelofibrosis . The combination drug treat CML investigational . Up 48 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients 18 year old Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) positive BCR/ABLpositive CML ( determine cytogenetics , FISH , PCR ) . 2 . Patients must continuous TKI therapy management CML . Any commercially available FDA approve TKI use , i.e. , imatinib mesylate ( IM ) , nilotinib ( NIL ) dasatinib ( DAS ) . Patients may receive TKI entry frontline salvage setting , include patient currently imatinib alphainterferon failure dasatinib nilotinib failure prior therapy include imatinib . 3 . Patients must receive current TKI least 18 month increase dose last 6 month . 4 . For phase I portion study , patient may include without CCyR provide remain chronic accelerated phase CML least CHR . For Phase II portion study patient must complete cytogenetic remission ( CCyR ) , regardless stage disease time start therapy TKI . 5 . Patients must detectable BCRABL transcript level meet least 1 follow criterion : Patient never achieve major molecular response ( MMR , define BCRABL/ABL &lt; /=0.1 % international scale ( currently equivalent 0.28 MDACC molecular diagnostic laboratory ) , &amp; transcript level show least 2 consecutive measure separate least 1 month increase value ; achieve major molecular response lose , interim increase transcript level least onelog , confirm two consecutive analysis separate least 1 month ; patient receive therapy least 2 year &amp; lack sustain major molecular response ; patient receive therapy least 5 year &amp; lack sustain complete molecular response ( CMR , define transcript level still detectable MDACC molecular diagnostic laboratory ) . 6 . Patients must know interruption TKI therapy great 21 consecutive day total 6 week 6 month prior enrollment . 7 . Patients must able understand sign inform consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep institutional policy . 8 . ECOG performance status &lt; /=2 . 9 . Adequate organ function define : bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( unless associate Gilbert 's syndrome ) , ALT AST &lt; 2.5x ULN . 10 . ANC &gt; /=1 x10 ( 9 ) /L platelet &gt; /=100 x10 ( 9 ) /L . 11 . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance great equal 60 cc/min define CockcroftGault Equation : Males ( mL/min ) : ( 140age ) *IBW ( kg ) / 72* ( serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) ) ; Females ( mL/min ) :0.85* ( 140age ) *IBW ( kg ) / 72* ( serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) ) . 12 . Women childbearing potential advise avoid become pregnant therapy Ruxolitinib 30 day last dose practice effective method contraception . Men advise father child receive treatment Ruxolitinib 30 day last dose . Effective method contraception study include barrier method ( e.g. , condom , diaphragm ) ; spermicidal jelly foam ; oral , depo provera , injectable hormonal contraceptive ; intrauterine device ; tubal ligation ; abstinence . 1 . For phase I portion study , patient blast phase . For phase II portion study , patient accelerate blast phase . 2 . Patients receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . 4 . Patients clinically significant heart disease ( NYHA Class III IV ) . 5 . Patients QTc &gt; 480 msec . 6 . Patients take potent CYP3A4 inhibitor change alternate drug . 7 . Known suspected hypersensitivity ruxolitinib . 8 . Patients advance malignant hepatic tumor . 9 . Patients know active hepatitis B C , HIV infection . 10 . Patients medical condition concomitant medication opinion principal investigator may interfere therapeutic treatment .</criteria>
