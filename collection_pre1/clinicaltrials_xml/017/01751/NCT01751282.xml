	<brief_title>Study Effectiveness Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Fibrin Treat Chronic Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty-six ( 66 ) subject plan enrolled trial . subject 's duration participation 24 week therapy 4 week post-treatment visit . A run-in phase 2 week require prior randomization/enrollment . All subject receive appropriate standard care chronic wound , include dressing , bandage , off-loading , require . All subject receive either saline , fibrin MSCs fibrin use identical double-barreled syringe keep blind . Therefore , subject randomize one three group : 1. conventional standard therapy control saline spray 2. conventional standard therapy fibrin spray 3. conventional standard therapy MSCs ( autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ) fibrin spray Screening Visit : All inclusion exclusion information review make sure subject eligible entry study . The following procedure perform two week period : Biopsy - One ( 3 x 6 mm ) biopsy take edge wound additional diagnostic test culture cell . The second ( 3-4 mm ) biopsy take thigh culture cell laboratory assess heal process . The thigh biopsy excise take 3/4 inch long 1/4 inch wide margin around , suture close . The reason biopsy normal skin use compare heal process chronic wound . Blood Sampling - Blood drawn laboratory test assess overall well-being , HIV , Hepatitis B &amp; C subject woman able bear child , test pregnancy . Wound Measurements - Wound measurement take determine size wound ass heal . Randomization Visit : If wound reduce significantly size , subject still eligible study ; he/she assign study treatment . The decision treatment he/she receive determine process call randomization . Randomization mathematical process use guarantee participant study equal chance assign treatment option available . The treatment group subject may assign follow : Group # 1 - Conventional Therapy Control Saline Spray -The subject receive conventional therapy , wound measurement , photography observation . At Day 1 treatment visit double-barrel syringe system use deliver topically normal saline wound . Up 2 additional treatment apply Weeks 3 &amp; 6 ( + - 2 3 day ) . Group # 2 -Conventional Therapy Fibrin Spray - The subject receive conventional therapy , wound measurement , photography , observation . At Day 1 treatment visit double-barrel syringe system use deliver topically fibrin alone wound . Up 2 additional treatment apply Weeks 3 &amp; 6 ( + - 2 3 day ) . Group # 3 - Conventional Therapy Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Fibrin Spray - The subject receive conventional therapy , wound measurement , photography observation . At Day 1 treatment visit double-barrel syringe system use deliver topically autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell fibrin . Up 2 additional treatment apply Weeks 3 &amp; 6 ( + - 2 3 day ) wound heal . Conventional Therapy - The subject receive standard care accept conventional therapy , regardless three group randomize . This standard care involve use dressing , bandage protective way increase heal wound . Bone Marrow Aspirate - Depending treatment group subject assign , either bone marrow aspirate and/or sham ( imitation ) aspirate perform visit . Day 1 Treatment Visit : All group receive study treatment assign randomization visit . Wound measurement , clinical observation , wound dressing , adverse event reporting photography perform . Weekly Follow-up Visits ( Weeks 1-24 ) : All group return weekly conventional therapy , wound measurement , clinical observation , wound dress change , adverse event report , photography . Two additional study treatment give Weeks 3 &amp; 6 ( + - 2 3 day ) wound heal . Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit ( Week 28 ) : All group return one month 24 week treatment evaluation , wound measurement , photography . Follow-up wound Biopsies : Participants three study treatment group ask additional biopsy wound edge Week 6 . This biopsy take wound heal .</detailed_description>
