	<brief_summary>The use local anesthetic become important aspect pain management surgical setting currently recommend pain management guideline . Elective outpatient hand surgery , carpal tunnel trigger finger release , cause minimum tissue disruption short duration . As result , local anesthetic agent major component post-operative pain control . The commonly used local anesthetic agent Lidocaine Bupivacaine . Lidocaine act faster ( within 2-5 minute injection ) reason often favor outpatient set pre-incisional injection . However effect last 2 hour , without epinephrine , 3 hour , epinephrine . On hand , Bupivacaine , slow onset action ( 5-10 minute injection ) effect last much longer , 4-8 hour . The delay onset action make less popular option primary source local anesthesia outpatient hand surgery . Given long duration anesthesia offer Bupivacaine , investigator believe give pre-operatively elective outpatient hand surgery offer effective post operative pain control compare use Lidocaine . There limited publish data confirm effectiveness use pre-operative Bupivicaine improve postoperative pain control decrease consumption narcotic . Therefore , aim study compare postoperative pain experience patient undergo either elective carpal tunnel release trigger finger release well use pain medication incision site infiltrate preemptively Lidocaine versus Bupivacaine . The investigator believe adequate post surgical pain control essential patient ' full functional recovery . Poorly control post surgical pain increase incidence surgery related complication thus increase health care cost . It also reduce patient ' mobility , delay return full function , . If poorly control , post surgical pain may progress chronic pain rarely complex regional pain syndrome may ensue .</brief_summary>
