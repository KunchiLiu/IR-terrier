	<brief_summary>The current proposal randomize clinical trial test efficacy Functional Family Therapy ( FFT ) administer video teleconference ( FFT-V ) home substance abuse adolescent . In proposed investigation , FFT-V compare FFT administer face-to-face family home well services-as-usual ( SAU ) condition . The overarch objective study examine degree empirically base model substance abuse treatment FFT effectively administer via video teleconferencing adolescent family live rural remote area would otherwise unlikely access treatment . The specific aim propose study ( 1 ) evaluate efficacy FFT-V compare FFT SAU reduce adolescent drug use , HIV risk behavior , delinquency , recidivism , ( 2 ) evaluate efficacy FFT-V compare FFT establish functional level therapeutic alliance formation , treatment attendance , retention , satisfaction treatment , ( 3 ) evaluate efficacy FFT-V compare FFT SAU impact core mechanism change adolescent behavior include improved level family function adolescent association substance use peer , ( 4 ) conduct preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis derive initial estimate relative cost treatment modality per outcome unit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well document 10 % adolescent clinically diagnosable substance use problem receive treatment give year . One major contribute factor chronic level unmet need treatment among population unavailability inaccessibility treatment service . Service accessibility particularly limited rural area . To address problem service availability accessibility rural area , use video teleconferencing technology provide direct service emerge within field medicine psychiatry particular . The use technology enhance delivery behavioral psychotherapy begin emerge well . A handful primarily small-scale pilot feasibility study indicate psychotherapy intervention administer use video teleconferencing technology may effective traditional face-to-face intervention . Few randomized clinical trial telepsychotherapy conduct date , however , virtually none examine video teleconferencing intervention type child adolescent behavioral problem include substance abuse . The propose study intend address need research evaluate application video teleconferencing technology mean service delivery substance abuse adolescent family live rural area . Specifically , study examine efficacy Functional Family Therapy administer video teleconference ( FFT-V ) home substance abuse adolescent . FFT-V compare FFT administer face-to-face family home well services-as-usual ( SAU ) coordinate Juvenile Services Division ( JSD ) State New Mexico Children , Youth , Families Department ( CYFD ) . FFT , base 30 year research , establish EBT adolescent substance abuse relate problem behavior HIV risk delinquency . Moreover , FFT one evidence-based therapy show effective rural family . The study conduct home participate adolescent parent live rural community locate 30 50 mile Center Family Adolescent Research ( CFAR ) Albuquerque , NM . One hundred twenty youth refer study Children Youth Family Department juvenile probation officer within two rural county New Mexico , Sandoval Valencia , adjacent town Albuquerque locate Bernalillo County . Adolescent participant meet diagnostic criterion substance abuse dependence , along participate parent , randomly assign FFT , FFT-V , SAU condition . Four assessment participant three condition occur : pre-treatment , 4- , 8- , 12 month treatment initiation . Outcome analyse examine adolescent substance abuse , HIV risk behavior , delinquency , recidivism , family functioning , adolescent association substance abuse peer . The study also examine clinical process variable know impact treatment efficacy ( e.g. , therapeutic alliance formation , treatment motivation , retention ) . The overarch objective study examine degree empirically base model substance abuse treatment FFT effectively administer via video teleconferencing adolescent family live rural remote area thus less access treatment .</detailed_description>
