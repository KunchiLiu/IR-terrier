	<detailed_description>Leishmaniasis disease cause protozoan parasite genus Leishmania . The parasite transmit animal human reservoir bite infect female phlebotomine sand fly . This study randomize , open-label clinical trial design evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity LEISH-F3 recombinant protein antigen formulate GLA-SE , MPL-SE , SE adjuvant healthy adult 18 49 year age . Each subject 's duration participation 18 month . Subjects receive total 3 dos vaccine , give intramuscular injection Days 0 , 28 , 168 . The volume vaccine dose 0.5 mL . A computerized system use acquire data regard halting criterion throughout study . Primary objective evaluate safety tolerability LEISH-F3 formulate GLA-SE , MPL-SE , SE follow intramuscular administration 20 µg LEISH-F3 together 5 µg GLA-SE , 10 µg MPL-SE , SE alone . Secondary objective ass immunogenicity LEISH-F3 formulate GLA-SE , MPL-SE , SE evaluate IgG antibody responses LEISH-F3 Days 0 , 28 , 56 , 168 , 196 , 365 , T cell responses LEISH-F3 Days 0 , 14 , 42 , 168 , 182 , 365 . A substudy perform use 12 subject Study Group ( Groups 1 , 2 3 ) additional 12 subject serve control . This substudy investigate whether , murine cell , cell surface marker ( CD11a , CD49d ) use surrogate identify protective immune CD4+ T cell human subject receive vaccine antigen .</detailed_description>
