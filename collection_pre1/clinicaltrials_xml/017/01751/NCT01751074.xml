	<brief_summary>The potential drug interaction Darapladib Rosuvastatin felt low would helpful quantify risk man order guide prescribe physician . The primary aim study estimate potential effect repeat dos Darapladib PK Rosuvastatin well evaluate safety tolerability . Two part approach plan study . Part A study examine effect repeat dos Darapladib PK Rosuvastatin healthy volunteer Caucasian descent . Based whether significant increase Rosuvastatin exposure observe Caucasians Part A , decision make regard whether proceed conditional Part B examine effect healthy volunteer Far-East Asian descent . In part , subject receive Rosuvastatin 10 milligram ( mg ) daily ( QD ) 1 day first treatment period ( Treatment Period 1 ) , follow 4 day PK sample period/wash-out . Subjects receive darapladib 160 mg QD next 10 day 24-hour PK sample last day ( Day 14 study ) . Immediately follow , subject receive combination Darapladib 160 mg Rosuvastatin 10 mg 1 day continue Darapladib dose 160 mg QD additional 3 day ( Treatment Period 2 ) blood sample collect assess Rosuvastatin PK . Plasma sample collect Day 15 analyze Rosuvastatin Darapladib concentration . Subjects require return unit approximately 10 14 day follow last dose study medication clinic visit assessment return 35 Â±7 day follow last dose final follow-up visit study . The duration subject 's participation study screen follow-up approximately three month . Approximately 18 evaluable subject enrol Part A another 18 subject enrol Part B ( conduct ) complete dose assessment .</brief_summary>
