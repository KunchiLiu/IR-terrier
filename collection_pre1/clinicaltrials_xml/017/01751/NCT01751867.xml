	<brief_title>An Effectiveness Safety Study Decitabine Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective ( look forward use periodic observation collect predominantly follow patient enrollment ) , open-label ( people involve study know identity assign drug ) , Phase IIIb study evaluate efficacy safety decitabine treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Patients randomize ( study drug assign chance ) 1:1 ratio receive treatment decitabine either 3-day 5-day course therapy . When minimum 30 patient reach 3-day course therapy , rest patient enrol 5-day course therapy . Each patient study treat minimum 4 cycle ; however , complete partial response may take long 4 cycle . The entire study duration patient approximately two year . Safety evaluate patient monitoring adverse event , physical examination , vital sign measurement , electrocardiogram , hematology clinical chemistry testing .</detailed_description>
