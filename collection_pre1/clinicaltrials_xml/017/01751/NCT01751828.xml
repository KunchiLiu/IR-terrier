	<brief_summary>The long-term goal determine decrease blood flow brain ( cerebral hypoperfusion ) predictive antidepressant outcomes late-life depression ( LLD ) . Studies young adult report successful antidepressant treatment associate increase cerebral blood flow , change blood flow observe nonresponders . Thus cerebral hypoperfusion may biomarker poor response antidepressant . In LLD , may occur secondarily underlie vascular disease . If LLD characterize cerebral hypoperfusion predictive power identify individual poorly respond conventional antidepressant , would support study intervention improve cerebral perfusion may improve antidepressant outcome . As initial step research , pilot study utilize MRI examine rest blood flow deficit predict persist antidepressant nonremission elderly population . The rationale proposal guide design power requirement large , definitive trial examine relationship cerebral perfusion depression outcome . Importantly , support mechanism link LLD would also support study examine antidepressant efficacy drug may improve cerebral perfusion . The primary purpose pilot study ) demonstrate feasibility recruiting , scan , treat depressed elder ; b ) acquire preliminary data competitive grant submission . SPECIFIC AIM : To use MRI test difference cerebral perfusion individual remit 8-week course sertraline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After provide informed consent , participant complete brain MRI memory test . If currently take antidepressant well , take . Participants start sertraline , commercially available antidepressant . They monitor response side effect 8 week dos adjust need . After study , examine difference brain blood flow may predict respond sertraline .</detailed_description>
