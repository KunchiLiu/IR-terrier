	<brief_summary>Background : - Baclofen drug use control muscle stiffness people neurological disease . Some study suggest baclofen may reduce alcohol craving use . It help reduce anxiety alcoholic , turn help reduce craving . Researchers want see baclofen safe effective treatment alcoholic high anxiety level . Objectives : - To see baclofen safe helpful people alcoholism high anxiety level . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 65 year age diagnose alcoholism anxiety issue . - Participants must take anti-anxiety medication . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Tests alcohol dependency anxiety level also give . - Participants divide two group . One group take baclofen . The group placebo . - About 1 week screen visit , participant study visit . They answer question behavior mood . They start take either baclofen placebo . Participants take study drug three time day , every day . - After 1 week study drug , participant overnight stay National Institutes Health . They blood test answer question mood behavior . They also test involve choose drink alcohol answer question craving . - Participants stop take study drug 3-day period . - A final follow-up visit require 1 week overnight study visit . Participants receive information alcohol abuse treatment program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The selective GABAB receptor agonist baclofen identify possible medication able reduce alcohol crave intake alcohol dependent individual . In keep several preclinical study , clinical study demonstrate baclofen effect reduce alcohol crave intake promote alcohol abstinence . However , one trial alcoholic low severity dependence find robust treatment effect , difference baclofen placebo . The inconsistency baclofen effect alcohol drink among previous treatment trial suggest different AD individual may respond differently baclofen . Baclofen demonstrate consistently reduce anxiety alcoholic patient , analysis positive vs. null finding baclofen suggest alcoholic patient high level anxiety baseline may represent sub-population particularly responsive baclofen treatment . Therefore , study systematically test , first time , specific role baclofen alcohol-related outcome alcoholic individual high anxiety level . Furthermore , biobehavioral mechanism baclofen reduces drink well characterize . A human laboratory pilot study conduct Brown University non-treatment seek alcohol-dependent individual suggest baclofen reduces alcohol consumption naturalistic environment well well-controlled lab setting ( use alcohol self-administration [ ASA ] paradigm ) could mediate baclofen ability alter alcohol-related biphasic effect . An exploratory analysis also reveal specific genetic polymorphism might moderate baclofen effect , i.e . DRD4 5HTTLPR polymorphism , although sample pilot study small allow one draft definitive conclusion . The present project propose investigate baclofen use design similar use previous pilot study ( thus , already validate paradigm ) , thus represent first study test baclofen alcoholic individual high anxiety level , also first study investigate baclofen biobehavioral mechanism population baclofen may hypothetically show robust effect . Study population : Non-treatment seek alcohol-dependent male female high anxiety level . Design : The experimental design between-subject randomized double-blind control study . The medication condition baclofen t.i.d . placebo represent subject factor . Each participant randomly assign one two medication condition receive eight day medication , follow alcohol laboratory session Day 8 . The alcohol laboratory session conduct bar-like room NIAAA Outpatient Clinic NIH CRC . The study conduct consecutive phase appear contiguous volunteer : ( 1 ) one-week screening period ; ( 2 ) 8-day period ( + 1-5 day need permit participant flexibility schedule laboratory session ) participant take study medication ; ( 3 ) alcohol laboratory session , include cue reactivity ( CR ) test alcohol self-administration ( ASA ) procedure Day 8 ( last day target dose ) ; ( 4 ) 3-day period participant undergo dose reduction study medication ; ( 5 ) 1-week follow-up ( include taper phase ) . Outcome measure : Alcohol drink ASA measure primary outcome . Secondary objective include baclofen effect alcohol cue-induced response ( urge drink , attention cue , blood pressure , heart rate , saliva ) , subjective effect alcohol anxiety level . We also explore role possible moderator baclofen effect , namely family history alcoholism , early vs. later onset alcoholism , pre-treatment anxiety level genetic moderator ( DRD4 , 5-HTTPRL ) . This study offer direct benefit participant likely yield generalizable knowledge possible role baclofen treat alcoholic individual high anxiety level . This markedly facilitate identification novel pharmacotherapy , thus facilitate development novel alcoholism treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must male female 21 65 year old ( inclusive ) . Participants must meet criterion current DSMIVTR diagnosis alcohol dependence , support Structured Clinical Interview DSMIVTR Axis I Disorders ( SCID ) . Participants must Trait STAI &gt; 39 . Participants must good health confirm medical history , physical examination , ECG , blood/urine lab test . Females must postmenopausal least one year , surgically sterile , practice effective method birth control entry throughout study ; negative urine pregnancy test visit . Reliable method birth control include oral contraceptive Norplant ; barrier method diaphragms contraceptive jelly , cervical cap contraceptive jelly , condom contraceptive foam , intrauterine device ; partner vasectomy ; abstinence intercourse . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals express interest treatment alcoholism and/or anxiety . Pregnancy breast feeding woman use adequate form birth control Unable provide negative urine drug screen . Individuals diagnose current substance dependence diagnosis , alcohol nicotine . Meet DSMIV Axis I criteria lifetime diagnosis schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , psychosis . An active illness within past 6 month Visit 1 meet DSMIV criterion diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Subjects history attempt suicide exclude . Clinically significant medical abnormality ( i.e. , unstable hypertension , clinically significant ECG abnormality , Creatinine great equal 2 mg/dL ) . Although baclofen demonstrate safe profile administer alcoholic individual liver cirrhosis , include Hepatitis C , study employ oral administration alcohol . Therefore , individual clinically significant liver problem exclude , i.e . liver cirrhosis , AST ALT &gt; 5 time upper normal limit ( UNL ) , individual Hepatitis B C. Current use psychotropic medication discontinue may effect alcohol consumption ( thus confound result study ) may interact baclofen . Specifically , contraindicate medication include : naltrexone , acamprosate , alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor , topiramate , gabapentin , ondansetron , benzodiazepine , betablockers , H2blockers , alpha1 blocker . Medical contraindication use baclofen . A history adverse reaction hypersensitivity baclofen . Participants significant alcohol withdrawal symptom , define CIWAAr &gt; 8 . History epilepsy alcoholrelated seizure .</criteria>
