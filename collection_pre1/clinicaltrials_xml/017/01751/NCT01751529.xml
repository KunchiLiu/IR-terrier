	<criteria>1 . Able provide write informed consent 2 . Willing comply protocol requirement 3 . At least 18 year age 4 . Cohort 1 : Be eligible radical partial nephrectomy ablative therapy base upon least one renal lesion identify previous contrast enhance CT MR. OR 5 . Cohort 2 : High risk group ( patient recommend routine surveillance screen renal malignancy ) Have least one kidney lesion identify incompletely characterize screen US , CT , MR exam 1 . Critically ill medically unstable whose critical course observation period would unpredictable ( e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) require oxygen ) 2 . Known hypersensitivity sulfur hexafluoride component perflutren lipid ( Definity® ) 3 . Right left shunt , severe pulmonary hypertension ( Pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 90mmHg ) , adult respiratory distress syndrome 4 . Active cardiac disease include follow : Severe congestive heart failure ( class IV accordance classification New York Heart Association ) Unstable angina . Severe arrhythmia ( i.e . ventricular tachycardia , flutter fibrillation ; ventricular premature complex occur close precede Twave , multifocal complex ) . Myocardial infarction within 14 day prior date propose Definity® administration . Uncontrolled systemic hypertension ( Blood pressure : systolic blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 90 mm Hg despite optimal medical management controllable medication achieve BP &lt; 15/90 ) 5 . Is intensive care set 6 . Has unstable neurological disease ( e.g recent stroke TIA symptom ( &lt; 3 month ) ) cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ( TIAs ) within 3 month sign informed consent 7 . Undergone invasive procedure kidney lesion ( e.g . tissue biopsy , surgery , nonsurgical cytoreductive procedure ) inbetween identification lesion via US without contrast perflutren lipid administration 8 . Has previously enter study receive investigational drug within 30 day prior admission study 9 . Has medical condition circumstance would significantly decrease chance obtain reliable data achieve study objective : Mental illness Drug abuse 10 . Female patient pregnant lactating ( possibility pregnancy exclude negative serum urine BHCG result , obtain within 24 hour perflutren lipid administration , basis patient history , e.g . : tubal ligation , hysterectomy minimum 1 year without menses ) .</criteria>
