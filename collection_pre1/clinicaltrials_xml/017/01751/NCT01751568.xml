	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety , Tolerance , Pharmacokinetics Raltegravir-Containing Antiretroviral Therapy ( ART ) Regimen Children Infected With HIV TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People infect HIV also risk become infect TB , particularly many resource-limited setting , include Sub-Saharan Africa . Rifampicin medication commonly use treat TB . There need HIV treatment regimens contain new ARV medication well-tolerated minimal interaction rifampicin-containing TB medication regimen . This study enroll HIV-infected child never take ARV medication receive ARVs least 30 day prior study entry infect TB take start TB medication regimen include rifampicin . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerance raltegravir-containing ARV regimens treat HIV administer rifampicin-containing regimen treat TB child . Study researcher also evaluate pharmacokinetics medication ( i.e. , medication absorb process body ) determine effective dose raltegravir administer TB regimen contain rifampicin . During study , researcher continuously monitor participant data safety factor . Researchers may adjust dose raltegravir give participant prior enrol additional participant . At study entry , participant undergo medical medication history review , physical examination , medication adherence assessment , blood collection , urine collection . Participants receive chewable raltegravir tablet twice daily , also take TB medication , include rifampicin , two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) ARV medication choose participant ' doctor . This study provide raltegravir participant ; medication prescribe participant ' doctor . At study visit Days 5 8 , participant remain clinic 12 hour . They take part study procedure occur entry visit , also small amount blood collect several time throughout 12 hour measure amount medication blood . After Day 5 8 visit , participant begin receive fourth ARV medication chosen doctor , addition medication . Participants continue receive raltegravir stop take TB medication . They continue take third ARV medication two ARV medication 3 month stop receive raltegravir TB medication . Additional study visit occur Day 14 , Weeks 4 8 , every 4 week participant stop receive raltegravir TB medication , 4 12 week stop raltegravir TB medication . These study visit include study procedure occur study entry . Participants enrol study total 4 9 month .</detailed_description>
