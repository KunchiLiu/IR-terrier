	<brief_title>Trial Panitumumab Cisplatin , Fluourouracil Docetaxel Locally Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators propose phase I/II study order evaluate effect panitumumab combine active regimen , DCF ( Docetaxel/Cisplatin/Fluourouracil ) , chemotherapy - naive patient advance cancer stomach . Investigators hypothesize addition panitumumab DCF regimen advance cancer stomach gastroesophageal junction feasible , well tolerate could achieve objective response rate great 40 % . The 2-weekly schedule DCF use chemotherapy since recently present trial demonstrate comparable efficacy favourable toxicity profile comparable 3-weekly schedule .</detailed_description>
