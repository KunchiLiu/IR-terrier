	<brief_title>RAMP Study : A Study Comparing Two Lumbar Fusion Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment Arms : The transacral lumbar interbody fusion ( include 1L+ 2L+ ) minimally invasive technique use transacral approach achieve fusion L5-S1 L4-L5-S1 spinal level . The transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion ( TLIF ) perform use posterior unilateral bilateral incision lumbar spine access . Both study procedure approve use conform US regulatory requirement . The study employ procedure device use consistent 510 ( k ) , legally clear , label . Study Design , Objective : The study objective demonstrate non-inferiority transacral lumbar interbody fusion procedure transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion procedure ( TLIF ) meeting primary secondary study endpoint list . Study design , Endpoints : Primary Endpoint : Efficacy : Fusion target vertebral body ( L4-L5 L5-S1 ) 24 month determine Central Radiographic Reviewer 's interpretation high resolution Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan . Secondary Endpoints : Safety : Incidence major device-related adverse event and/or failure 24 month , define require revision surgery secondary operation , event result permanent disability death . Clinical Effectiveness : A 20 % decrease back pain compare baseline 24 month measure Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) score . Clinical Effectiveness : A 20 % decrease disability compare baseline 24 month measure Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) . Study Design , Enrollment Analyses : Approximately 200 subject enrol study receive one two study treatment study . The enrollment period expect last approximately 18 month , 24 month follow period . Approximately 15-20 site participate , Investigators must proficient lumbar fusion procedure . Analyses : Eight evaluation : Pre-Operative , Operative , Discharge , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 Months . Safety efficacy analysis perform follow-up point study well final analysis subject complete study .</detailed_description>
