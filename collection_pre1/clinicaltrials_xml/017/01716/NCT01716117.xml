	<brief_summary>This clinical research study design determine safety effectiveness Surpass Flow Diverter ( Surpass System ) , investigational device develop treat wide neck , large giant intracranial aneurysm . An intracranial aneurysm bulge wall blood vessel brain . The bulge cause weaken vessel wall . If leave untreated , bulge may continue grow large ultimately vessel may break open ( rupture ) , result serious bleed around brain . The information collect study use evaluate well patient treat Surpass System immediately treatment aneurysm long period time ( 5 year ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study determine safety effectiveness Surpass Flow Diverter ( Surpass System ) endovascular treatment large giant wide-necked intracranial aneurysm internal carotid artery terminus . The Surpass Flow Diverter intracranial implant design place parent artery divert blood flow away aneurysm . Use Surpass System may associate decrease neurological death ipsilateral stroke patient large giant wide-neck aneurysm . In give patient , Surpass System deem effective treatment result complete occlusion aneurysm without clinically significant stenosis parent artery one year .</detailed_description>
