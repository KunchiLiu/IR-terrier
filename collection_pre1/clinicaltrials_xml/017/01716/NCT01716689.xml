	<brief_title>Clinical Study Metronomic Oral Cyclophosphamide Patients With Advanced Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient receive continuous metronomic oral cyclophosphamide dose 50mg daily . Tumor assessment perform baseline every 6 week thereafter assess response disease progression . Toxicity monitor throughout treatment . The study 's primary end point define clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) 12 week measure disease control . The study design distinguish favorable true PFR 40 % null rate 20 % [ Van Glabbeke et al . EJC 2002 ] . With CBR 40 % , metronomic oral cyclophosphamide dose schedule patient population consider worthy evaluation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : 1 . Participants must histologically cytologically confirm , metastatic and/or unresectable high grade sarcoma standard multimodality curative therapy exist longer effective . Patients low grade sarcoma need additionally demonstrate disease progression last 6 month prior study entry . 2 . Age &gt; 21 year 3 . Prior antisarcoma chemotherapy Participants 21 64 year age time study entry must receive least one line establish chemotherapy , treatment exists ; refuse treatment , include either anthracycline and/or ifosfamide . Patients whose sarcomas know establish therapy eligible study without requirement prior therapy . Participants &gt; 65 year age time study entry eligible study without requirement prior treatment 4 . ECOG performance status 03 ( see Annex A ) 5 . Measurable disease outside prior irradiated area define RECIST 1.1 guideline . A lesion previously irradiate area eligible measurable disease unless objective evidence progression lesion prior study enrollment 6 . No limit number prior chemotherapy biologics 7 . Participants must normal organ function define : Hemoglobin &gt; 10g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/mm3 Platelet count &gt; 75,000/mm3 Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST/ALT &lt; 3 time ULN ( &lt; 5 time ULN hepatic involvement present ) Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN . If creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN , calculate creatinine clearance time ( CCT ) perform patient would eligible study calculate CCT &gt; 10 mL/min . [ NB : Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) = [ ( 140 age ) x weight [ kg ] x 1.22 ] / ( serum creatinine [ umol/L ] . In woman , multiply result 0.85 8 . Resolution , return baseline clinically significant toxicity relate prior therapy 9 . Patients must suitable oral drug administration 10 . Willingness use effective mean birth control throughout duration clinical study least 3 month completion study drug 11 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test perform within 7 day start study drug administration 12 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . 1 . Patients diagnose gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) 2 . Participants systemic anticancer therapy within 3 week study entry ( 8 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) 3 . Palliative radiotherapy major surgery within 3 week study entry 4 . Concurrent use anticancer therapy study agent 5 . Symptomatic uncontrolled brain central nervous system metastases 6 . Participants may receive concomitant investigational agent 7 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 8 . Individuals history different malignancy , cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , ineligible , except diseasefree least 5 year , deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy OR primary malignancy neither currently clinically significant require active intervention .</criteria>
