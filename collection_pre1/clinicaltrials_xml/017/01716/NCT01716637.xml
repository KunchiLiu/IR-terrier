	<brief_summary>While cause AD still unknown , evidence suggest develop complex series event brain occur time . Two pathway possibly involve development AD inflammation oxidative stress . Scientists link chronic inflammatory event brain onset progression Alzheimer 's Disease . Oxidative stress also implicate pathogenesis number neurological disorder include Alzheimer 's Disease . Etanercept ( Enbrel® ) approve drug treatment several form arthritis administer injection . Some research suggest etanercept , administer injection tissue close spinal column ( perispinally ) , may modulate certain aspect immune system provide beneficial effect people Alzheimer 's disease . Studies suggest supplementation specific nutrient may also positive effect support cognitive function . This study conduct one research office volunteer diagnose mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease . Each qualify participant randomly assign receive etanercept injection plus nutritional supplement 6 week follow crossover washout period 4 week receive nutritional supplement alone vice versa another 6 week . Participants undergo blood urine safety assessment begin end 6 week treatment period . During 4 6 weekly visit treatment period injection , complete cognitive test twice ; 2 hour injection . During 4 6 weekly visit treatment period without injection , also complete cognitive test twice ; 2 hour ask lie onto table 5 minute . You allow continue standard care Alzheimer 's disease throughout participation study .</brief_summary>
