	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -positive head neck cancer treat less aggressive regimen radiation therapy chemotherapy ( paclitaxel ) initially receive two cycle chemotherapy ( carboplatin/paclitaxel ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy Followed Chemoradiotherapy Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given toxicity high dose cisplatin , attention focus identify patient low risk failure may potentially benefit less aggressive chemoradiotherapy approach . HPV-positive Head Neck Cancer respond favorably radiation therapy . This prompt investigator suggest patient cancer might `` over-treated '' unnecessarily subject toxicity intensive chemoradiotherapy excessively high radiation dos . This study select patient HPV-positive Head Neck cancer attenuate therapy may important implication individualization care future . The regimen carboplatin paclitaxel select induction chemotherapy phase ease administration , improve toxicity profile , high rate dose delivery , excellent publish result show high response rate overall survival . This study use induction chemotherapy primarily mean select HPV-positive Head Neck Cancer patient , may benefit significant radiation dose de-intensification concurrent chemoradiotherapy phase treatment . The rationale risk-adapted approach local therapy base HPV status administer effective comprehensive treatment individualized diagnosis assessment response induction chemotherapy ( patient HPV-positive tumor ) , thus avoid unnecessary potentially toxic treatment , hence optimize therapeutic ratio .</detailed_description>
