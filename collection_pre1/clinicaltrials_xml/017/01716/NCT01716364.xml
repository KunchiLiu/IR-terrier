	<brief_summary>Patients form acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) cure conventional therapy new approach need . For last 15 year investigate potential use patient 's T cell ( type white blood cell [ WBC ] ) eradicate tumor . We demonstrate feasibility approach cell culture animal model AML MM . Over last 5 year prepare treat patient part Phase I ( first human ) clinical trial . The trial treatment involve collect patient 's WBCs blood standard well establish safe process call apheresis . The cell culture specialized laboratory ( Good Manufacturing Practice condition , similar standard pharmaceutical produce ) 12 day convert cell specialized tumor-attacking T cell . Early culture process cell expose virus ( modify infect replicate outside special culture condition ) contain special gene . Via virus , gene insert patient 's T cell culture get incorporate T cell 's genetic machinery . As T cell replicate , new gene produce protein receptor become part patient 's T cell . This protein receptor T cell capacity specifically recognize bind protein leukemia myeloma cell call `` Lewis Y '' antigen . After modified T cell infused patient , home bone marrow ( track monitor special radiological technique ) new protein receptor T cell surface recognize bind cancer cell ( express Lewis Y ) . Once bound onto cancer cell , T cell get activate subsequently replicate kill cancer cell . The novelty approach T-cells kill cell Lewis Y surface - cancer cell . Moreover , normal cell person 's body carry Lewis Y , treatment likely minor side effect . This gene therapy trial unique although primary purpose test safety approach , patient monitor closely anti-tumor response . As trial progress , dose T cell infused increase , hope result well strong immune response leukemia myeloma .</brief_summary>
