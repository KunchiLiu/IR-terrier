	<brief_summary>Background : - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE lupus ) autoimmune disease , mean body 's immune system mistakenly attack healthy tissue result inflammation tissue damage . SLE involve almost organ symptom range severity mild life-threatening ; symptom also vary person person . Current treatment lupus effective people . Medications use treat lupus serious side effect . - Omalizumab drug use treat severe allergic asthma . It help prevent allergic reaction reduce antibody blood . These antibody also present people Lupus . Researchers want see omalizumab safe effective treatment people Lupus . Objectives : - To test safety omalizumab people lupus . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age moderately active Lupus even standard treatment . Design : - Subject screen take place NIH Clinical Center include medical history , physical exam , blood urine laboratory test , assessment Lupus disease activity . Some participant may require additional testing . All eligible person interested enrol ask come back NIH within 2 week begin study . - The study conduct three phase , total 15 study visit 38 week . Two visit overnight hospital stay . The rest outpatient visit . During visit participant monitor physical exam , assessment lupus disease activity , review treatment related side effect , blood urine testing . - For first phase , participant infusion ( skin ) either omalizumab placebo . They overnight hospital stay first infusion outpatient safety monitor visit 2 week . If subject safety measure good return 2 week receive second dose . They get three dos every 4 week give outpatient visit NIH . - In second phase , begin 16th week study , participant receive omalizumab . This mean subject get omalizumab continue receive subject receive placebo begin get omalizumab . They overnight hospital stay infusion return 2 week safety monitor visit . If subject safety measure good return 2 week receive next dose . They get three dos every 4 week give outpatient visit NIH . - The third phase final series visit take place week 32 week 36 . During visit subject physical exam include disease activity assessment , blood urine test . No medication give visit . - All subject give information , instruction medication possible allergic reaction omalizumab . - Throughout study test procedure perform need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The immune system systemic lupus erythematosus characterize abnormal activation various cell type , T B lymphocytes , macrophage dendritic cell production autoantibody nuclear antigen . Until recently pathogenic autoantibody think IgG antibody . We recently show Lyn deficient mouse develop lupus nephritis-like disease mediate basophil activate IgE autoantibody . Moreover , SLE patient also elevate serum self reactive IgEs , activate basophil express lymph node home molecule CD62L MHC Class II molecule , HLA-DR ; marker associate increased disease activity . Follow study confirm association IgE anti-dsDNA antibody active SLE use SLEDAI score 4 cutoff ( unpublished ) . In addition , also observe strong correlation IgE dsDNA antibody hypocomplementemia strongly suggest autoantibody serologic marker immune activation SLE . Based observation propose deplete IgE ( include IgE autoantibody ) may lead improvement SLE reduce IgE-induced basophil activation . Omalizumab humanize IgG1 monoclonal antibody human IgE . It approve FDA treatment asthma . Omalizumab show effectively deplete circulate IgE decrease basophil action . In study propose assess safety omalizumab moderately active lupus patient assess effect circulate IgE autoantibody basophil activation . We also collect preliminary data clinical efficacy . Primary Objective : To determine omalizumab tolerated patient Systemic Lupus Erythematosus . Secondary Objectives : To determine use omalizumab subset SLE patient mild moderate disease elevate IgE autoantibody level lead clinical efficacy . Study Population : Adults 18 year old diagnose SLE attend NIAMS outpatient clinic ( OP-9 ) well rheumatology outpatient clinic private rheumatologist office around country moderately active lupus ( SLEDAI 2K score 4-14 ) . Design : - Active lupus : Assess study eligibility ( week -2 ) . - If fulfills criteria randomize 2:1 ratio omalizumab vs. placebo respectively within 2 week ( week 0 ) . - Omalizumab load dose ( 600 mg ) placebo subcutaneous injection day 0 , follow omalizumab ( 300 mg ) placebo subcutaneous injection every 4 week ( week 4 , 8 , 12 ) - Evaluate patient week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 16 . Preliminary analysis available data do last subject complete blinded phase ( week 16 ) . - Open label phase : On week 16 subject randomize placebo arm originally receive 600 mg omalizumab subcutaneous injection whereas omalizumab arm receive 300 mg omalizumab subcutaneous injection blind fashion . After subject receive omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 week , week 20 , 24 , 28 . - Evaluate patient week 18 , 20 , 24 , 28 - Follow phase : Subjects follow evaluation 4 8 week last dose ( week 32 36 ) . - Allow one time intra-muscular injection methylprednisolone 0.4 0.75 mg/kg continue disease activity/flare . Outcome Measures Primary Endpoint : Safety omalizumab patient SLE . Secondary Endpoints : Reduced free IgE autoantibody level : statistical significant difference change IgE autoantibody level placebo omalizumab group 16 week Decreased basophil activation : statistically significant difference change proportion activate basophil placebo omalizumab group 16 week Reduced IgG autoantibody level : statistically significant difference change IgG autoantibody level placebo omalizumab group 16 week Pharmacodynamics measure total free IgE FcepsilonR level associate PK Clinical efficacy : difference clinical responder 16 week . Clinical response define improvement SLEDAI 2K score 4 without worsen PGA ( physician global assessment ) This study provide important preliminary information safety possible effect IgE depletion SLE patient . If omalizumab well tolerate show preliminary evidence efficacy , follow study test clinical usefulness plan . This agent expect devoid common toxicity therapy commonly use treatment SLE , myelosuppression , amenorrhea osteoporosis .</detailed_description>
