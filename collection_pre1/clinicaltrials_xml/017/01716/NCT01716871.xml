	<brief_summary>Introduction : The military population high-risk injury painful sprain , especially ankle . The referenced treatment method pain cryotherapy , consist apply cold-packs injure ankle several time day . However , another pain treatment develop commonly use high-level sport team rheumatologist efficacy never assess within military population , i.e . hyperbaric CO2 cryotherapy , also call neurocryostimulation . Research design : This study carry French multicenter basis , study consist randomize controlled superiority trial open-label prospective analysis treatment 40-year-old military patient young suffer acute ankle sprain . Two group make : patient treat either neurocryostimulation reference cryotherapy ( cold-packs ) . The care protocol group consist six supervise 30 minute-sessions within period three consecutive day . Hypothesis : Neurocryostimulation effective treatment pain severity result ankle sprain reference treatment cold-packs . Moreover , theorize total consumption paracetamol number day temporary inaptitude work exemption low patient treated neurocryostimulation . Outcomes : For session , pain severity assess 100-mm Visual Analog Scale begin end session 20 minute later four-step walk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Using NEurocryostimulation Military Ankle Sprains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In France , one ankle sprain per 10,000 person/day mainly result athletic practice . The military population one physically active population due take part sport exercise , schedule sport period leisure sport , require military exercise increase soldier ' risk injury low extremity , especially ankle . The incidence rate ankle sprain injury among -active-duty US service member 34.95 per 1000 person/year , thus 5 time great previously report civilian study report literature . These among two first lead cause sport physical training related hospitalization among U.S. Army population . Sprains lead numerous consequence long-term physical restriction , ankle instability , risk recurrence , also absenteeism work and/or participation sport chronic pain . A efficient treatment seem necessary preventing trouble . The usual care protocol ankle sprain ( RICE protocol ) involve cryotherapy ( usually cold-pack ( R ) apply directly injury several time day exist undesirable effect ) . An innovative treatment method , neurocryostimulation , develop Cluzeau French Company 1993 , gain rapid wide-spread use among physiotherapist , rheumatologist , athletes.It would provide powerfull anti-inflammatory , myorelaxant analgesic effect contradictory result show literature . Demoulin et al . aim assess efficacy neurocryostimulation follow total knee arthroplasty compare routinely used strategy apply cold therapy , n't show significant difference regard pain severity , mobility perimetric measure . However , pilot study lead Switzerland , compare pain report patient acute post-operative knee arthroscopy , show pain differential high neurocryostimulation reference cryotherapy ( 2.2 versus 0.5 ) . And , Chatap et al . show prospective study pain score decrease significantly four session elderly patient acute chronic pain . At day , No study prove efficacy neurocryostimulation versus cold pack pain result ankle sprain . A good treatment ankle sprain could reduce pain , time , also reduce consumption analgesic , time temporary inaptitude work exemption .</detailed_description>
