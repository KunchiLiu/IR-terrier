	<criteria>Healthy subject Age 1885 year inclusive time consent . The elderly treatment group define age 65 year . It require least 4 subject elderly group 75 year old . All subject `` healthy '' Normal renal function ( 1865 yearold subject ) , define estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) Study &gt; 90 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 Screening Visit . The stability renal function confirm 2 determination serum creatinine separate least 7 day Subjects renal impairment Age 1885 year inclusive time consent . Estimated glomerular filtration rate MDRD Study estimate Screening Visit describe FDA guidance . Subjects must clinically significant abnormality ( except abnormality explain renal impairment disorder ) .

Healthy subject Subject clinically significant history disorder detect medical interview/physical examination Current relevant previous history serious , severe unstable ( acute progressive ) physical psychiatric illness , medical disorder may require treatment make subject unlikely fully complete study , condition present undue risk investigational product procedure . History diabetes mellitus , nephrotic syndrome ( define plasma albumin &lt; 30 g/dL and/or proteinuria &gt; 3 g/day ) , metabolic endocrine disease know associated alteration plasma lipid level . Uncontrolled hypothyroidism define thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) 1.5 time great upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Subjects renal impairment Current recurrent disease , impaired renal function could affect , action , absorption disposition investigational product , clinical laboratory assessment . Concurrent chronic acute illness unstable medical condition ( associate renal disease ) may deteriorate thus confound result safety assessment , increase risk subject lead difficulty comply protocol . A potassium concentration &gt; 6.2 mmol/L Screening Visit . Subjects renal transplant . History nephrotic syndrome ( define plasma albumin &lt; 30 g/dL and/or proteinuria &gt; 3 g/day ) , metabolic endocrine disease know associated alteration plasma lipid level ( uncontrolled hypothyroidism define TSH 1.5 time great upper reference range value ) . Subjects peritoneal dialysis . Uncontrolled systolic diastolic blood pressure define investigator . Liver enzymes ( ALT , AST , GGT ) 2 fold ULN Screening Visit Day 2 . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus determined investigator . Congestive Heart Failure classify New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV . Any major illness would opinion investigator put study subject risk interfere study conduct . All subject Acute illness , judge investigator , within 2 week first dose investigational product . Known suspect intolerance hypersensitivity investigational product , closely related compound , state ingredient . Subject history thyroid disorder stabilize thyroid medication treatment within 3 month Screening Visit . History alcohol substance abuse within last year . A positive screen alcohol drug abuse Screening Visit Day 2 . Male subject consume 3 unit alcohol per day . Female subject consume 2 unit alcohol per day . One alcohol unit=1 beer ( 12 oz/355 mL ) = 1 wine ( 5 oz/150 mL ) = 1 liquor ( 1.5 oz/40 mL ) A positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody screen , Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody screen . Current use medication ( include overthecounter , herbal homeopathic preparation ) could affect ( improve worsen ) condition study , could affect action , absorption , disposition investigational product ( ) , clinical laboratory assessment . ( Current use define use within 14 day dose ) . Subjects must stable dose allow medication 14 day prior dose .
