	<brief_summary>It show many patient lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) low level complement . Several drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use cancer . However , drug often use combination therapy mean two drug part treatment . Many people , especially elderly patient , put use multiple drug side effect . The main purpose study see patient respond therapy human plasma ( know fresh frozen plasma FFP ) ofatumumab . Another purpose study find therapy increase chance get rid leukemia . This study also look level complement blood . The level complement may allow good understand whether increase level complement give FFP may help control leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Fresh Frozen Plasma Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vast majority patient CLL elderly often tolerate standard multi-agent chemotherapeutic biochemotherapeutic approach . Based , less toxic effective treatment option need . Ofatumumab proven effective patient relapse and/or refractory CLL . Previous study show ofatumumab effective rituximab activate complement utilizing complement-dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) . This study investigate treat relapsed/refractory CLL patient FFP combination ofatumumab . The hypothesis patient CLL low complement level get treat humanized antibody like rituximab ofatumumab level drop even . Both antibody utilize complement exert cytotoxic effect , thus hypothesize replace complement level FFP enhance efficacy ofatumumab .</detailed_description>
