	<detailed_description>The overall goal proposal well understand molecular basis structural physiologic consequence airway remodel severe asthma remodel change time . In context , investigator propose study well-characterized cohort adult pediatric subject severe asthma use multidisciplinary approach include state-of-the-art morphometric , imaging , physiologic measurement airway . The investigator contrast finding group well-controlled asthma , normal control , diseased control ( chronic bronchitis ) identify feature provide biologic target unique severe asthma . The investigator demonstrate epithelial hyperplasia , goblet cell metaplasia mucin production feature airway remodel subject severe asthma , epithelial remodel due increase epithelial proliferation decrease cell death . The investigator propose individual severe asthma , comparison well control asthma , : ( I ) increase airway remodel evidence goblet cell metaplasia mucin production , ( II ) great airway thickness multidetector-row CT chest ( MDCT ) lead ventilation defect demonstrate hyperpolarized helium ( 3He ) MRI air trap demonstrate MDCT , ( III ) airway remodel associate severe progressive airflow obstruction . The investigator hypothesize goblet cell metaplasia increase mucin The investigator observe severe asthma drive IL-13- EGFR-dependent mechanism inhibit epithelial cell apoptosis allow IL-13 differentiation airway epithelium goblet cell ( Aim I ) . The investigator hypothesize remodel segmental airway severe asthma lead distal ventilation defect air trap ( Aim II ) . In effort define potential predictor subsequent decline lung function severe asthma , investigator hypothesize baseline airway remodel reflect MDCT airway wall area ( AWA % ) predictive FEV1 ( post-corticosteroid/bronchodilator FEV1 ) decline ( Aim III ) . The identification potential variable associate remodel severe asthma help identify individual risk would benefit specific target therapy . The concerted effort project together SARP lead new insight mechanistic basis severe asthma , elucidate differs mild-moderate asthma , identify potential target intervention , provide image metric objectively evaluate outcome new treatment .</detailed_description>
