	<detailed_description>In natural state within body , cell normally depend cellular respiration source energy ATP . During time complete partial food deprivation cell also rely ketosis additional energy source . Tumor cell contrast defective respect , lack ability utilize ketone body energy instead heavily dependent glycolysis survival . Malignant cell depend heavily glycolysis energy production even high oxygen state . If investigator limit supply glucose , glycolysis would decrease tumor cell would lose main source energy supply . In addition , increase carbohydrate intake sense pancreas result increase insulin secretion . Insulin important normal growth body potent growth factor stimulate mitosis via signal transduction DNA synthesis . It potent growth factor act bind cell membrane insulin receptor stimulate mitosis via protein kinase B/Akt- mediated signal transduction DNA synthesis . Insulin also anti-apoptotic property , mean less tumor cell death . Increased circulate insulin level associate increase risk certain cancer ( i.e . prostate colon cancer ) , association serum glucose level ( 8 ) . By limit carbohydrate intake , investigator might expect decreased tumor growth increase tumor cell destruction . Most human mouse tumor take glucose surround normal tissue . By use positron emission tomography fluoro-deoxy-glucose , FDG-PET scan use detect monitor tumor response chemotherapy radiation . In study , PET/CT scan would utilized measure amount ( screen visit ) glucose activity within certain tumor , diet . Primary Aim : To determine safety tolerability modify low carbohydrate diet people advance cancer across different tumor type . Hypothesi ( e ) : The long term tolerability KD ( Ketogenic Diet ) establish ( Groesbeck et al. , 2006 ) . Recent study involve human patient brain cancer show tolerability Ketogenic diet period long 19 month minimal side effect . However MAD ( Modified Atkins Diet ) long term side effect yet unclear . Given similarity MAD compare KD , less restrictive , long term side effect ( kidney stone , dyslipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux ) MAD project similar , reduce , comparison KD . Modified carbohydrate diet well ketogenic diet tolerate people epilepsy . It hypothesize effect diet overall weight loss , hyperlipidemia , blood glucose level minimal tolerable even cancer patient prolonged period time , 12 month possibly longer . Given tolerability diet brain cancer patient , hypothesize patient type tumor find diet tolerable safe . Secondary Aims : To determine quality life improve use diet . To determine diet effect tumor growth ( size spread ) determine effect progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) subject enrol study . Hypothesis ( e ) : The diet show good tolerance human adult patient study wherein diet tolerate well 12 week group diverse tumor type 10 year glioma patient . It hypothesize cancer patient able tolerate diet 16 week . Studies animal well tumor tissue model show slow tumor growth , instance also show tumor shrinkage . Human case report small study 16 patient show tumor shrinkage stable disease diet .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow criterion eligible study : 18 year age old . English speak write informed consent obtain . Patients present VAPHS Oncology inpatient outpatient clinic cancer advance metastatic stage . Must measurable disease least 1 cm great diameter CT MRI scanning . If new FDG avid satellite lesion note counted disease progression . The minimum size 1 cm . The tumor measure long diameter . Either primary tumor metastatic tumor , either may use . In absence primary tumor , usually measure next large metastatic lesion . The tumor choose use RECIST criterion measure ( screen visit ) tumor , use 4 response criterion , CR complete response= disappearance target lesion , PR= 30 % decrease sum long diameter target lesion , PD progressive disease= 20 % increase sum long diameter target lesion , SD stable disease= small change n't meet criteria Patients must solid , advanced metastatic tumor , fail respond chemotherapy chemotherapy holiday . Tumors must PET positive primary metastatic site . Patients must actively receive chemotherapy holiday refuse fail one prior chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment . Subjects may enrol study long active form chemotherapy radiotherapy intervention . No subject exclude base race , religion , ethnicity , gender HIV status , applicable . Exclusion : Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate . Secondary brain metastasis . History Gout . AST ATL &gt; 1.5 X ULN . Creatinine &gt; 2.0 . Hematologic malignancy BMI &lt; 22 .
