	<brief_summary>In recent year medicine enhance incorporation technological innovation area diverse cell biology , biochemistry , genetics , biophysics bioengineering . One exception rapid process implement technological advance occurs clinical medicine , penetration much less effective scientific professional field , even everyday life . Attempts tackle problem give rise various initiative US Europe , include Spain . There surprising paucity telemedicine system clinical practice , especially respect sleep-related breathing disorder , particularly obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , protocols urgently need alleviate healthcare problem represent under-diagnosis comorbidity , well long wait list treatment . In others word , grow awareness sleep disorder , especially OSA , accompany strategic change cost-effective diagnosis and/or treatment disease . CPAP therapy compliance always appropriate . Helping patient first two month usually determine compliance . Therefore , development strategy support patient first week essential . However , `` collides '' reality , difficult properly care patient congest sleep unit . It therefore necessary implement new imaginative control scheme especially beginning treatment . Patients ' follow-up perform telemedicine technology option aim substitute face-to-face visit least reduce considerably . In future context , idea professional charge CPAP patient monitor his/her agenda face-to-face visit televisits ( distance ) information patient provide online questionnaire certain frequency . In sense , project aim analyze whether CPAP treatment compliance OSA patient monitor telemedicine technique ( website televisits ) similar achieve standard monitoring cost-effective . The study design multicenter randomize trial parallel group blind final evaluation CPAP treatment follow two different strategy : one conventional monitoring hospital ( face-to-face visiting ) another telemedicine monitoring ( non-contact visit website ) .</brief_summary>
