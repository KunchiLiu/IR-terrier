	<detailed_description>In septic critically ill mechanically ventilated patient acute circulatory failure , inadequate volume resuscitation lead multiple organ failure . Early goal-directed therapy emphasize early aggressive hemodynamic support patient severe sepsis septic shock . On hand , increase microvascular permeability capillary leakage , conservative fluid management aggressive restriction fluid accumulation reduce lung water tissue edema suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome net . Fluid responsiveness refers ability heart increase stroke volume response volume load . Accurately predict volume responsiveness beneficial obviate need unnecessary fluid loading , detect patient may benefit volume load . By induce cyclic change pleural transpulmonary pressure , mechanical ventilation result cyclic change preload afterload , therefore , cyclic variation systolic pulse pressure . Recently , systemic review conclude dynamic preload indicator [ pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) , stroke volume variation ( SVV ) ] highly accurate predicting volume responsiveness critically ill patient . However , technique limit patient receive control ventilation adequate tidal volume ( &gt; 8 ml/Kg ) sedation paralysis need abolish spontaneous ventilation . For acute respiratory distress syndrome patient , protective ventilatory strategy suggest low tidal volume 6 ml/Kg . On contrary , high PEEP need acute respiratory distress syndrome prevent VALI induce leftward shift steep pat Frank-Starling curve increase fluid responsiveness . Whether dynamic preload indicator ( PPV SVV ) still effective acute respiratory distress syndrome patient predict fluid responsiveness remain controversial . Passive leg raise ( PLR ) , induce gravitational transfer blood lower part body toward central circulatory compartment , consider brief `` self volume challenge '' . Recently , systemic review meta-analysis conclude PLR-induced change cardiac output reliably predict fluid responsiveness regardless ventilation mode , underlie cardiac rhythm technique measurement recommend routine assessment fluid responsiveness majority ICU population . More importantly , prediction remain valuable patient cardiac arrhythmias spontaneous breathe activity . Respiratory variation pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude ( ΔPOP ) show able predict fluid responsiveness mechanically ventilated patient . The main advantage index noninvasive , widely available , inexpensive . Perfusion index ( PI ) , percentage infrared pulsatile nonpulsatile signal , reflect amplitude pulse oximeter waveform . Recently , Pleth Variability Index ( PVI ) , derive perfusion index , affords continuous monitor ΔPOP . PVI show correlate ΔPOP PPV demonstrate equivalent SVV predictor fluid responsiveness ventilate patient major surgery . However , whether PVI predict fluid responsiveness acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating low tidal volume high PEEP clear . Because aforementioned contrast effect low tidal volume high PEEP prediction fluid responsiveness , aim study compare relative predict power dynamic preload indicator ( PPV , SVV ) , passive leg raise test , PVI fluid responsiveness acute respiratory distress syndrome ventilate various PEEP level various tidal volume .</detailed_description>
