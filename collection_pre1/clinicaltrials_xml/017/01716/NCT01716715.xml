	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give cabozantinib-s-malate paclitaxel work treat patient persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer . Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether cabozantinib-s-malate paclitaxel effective treat patient persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity cabozantinib ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) relative weekly paclitaxel patient persistent recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer log-rank test assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) 3.68 month ( approximately pre-cycle 5 ) 7.36 month ( approximately pre-cycle 9 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . II . To estimate compare proportion patient respond therapy Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) response , overall survival ( OS ) , duration response arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To retrospectively correlate c-met proto-oncogene ( MET ) expression overall outcome . II . To retrospectively correlate c-MET copy number overall outcome . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
