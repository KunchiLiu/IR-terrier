	<detailed_description>Emerging stroke rehabilitation therapy show promise improve motor recovery stroke involve element high-intensity repetitive task-specific practice , might essential element treatment success . Two prominent example advance innovative rehabilitation therapy stroke include robotic rehabilitation ( RR ) mirror therapy ( MT ) . Based development mechanical biomedical engineering , RR emerge incorporates therapeutic element success motor rehabilitation : high-intensity , repetitiveness , task-specificity , feedback , bilateral training design . MT propose light translational research mirror neuron . In MT , patient place mirror beside unaffected limb block view affect limb , create illusion limb intact . The motor visual input MT facilitate activation premotor , primary motor somatosensory area , enhance sensory , perception motor ability . The MT may use restore sensory function , improve grip/grasp strength motor function . In addition , innovative technology , functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) , propose adjunct assist movement execution increase electric activity muscle movement active range motion patient low function . Robotic rehabilitation emphasize muscle strengthen motor restoration may implement combination FES improve treatment outcome stroke patient moderate-to-severe motor impairment movement performance functional outcome . Despite promise , research study investigate comparative efficacy rival therapy effect combine therapy relative mono-therapy lacking . An additional gap contemporary neurorehabilitation lack sufficient information threshold value clinically significant change variety functional domain relevant individualized medicine . In addition , research potential vales biomarkers ( eg , level oxidative stress ) use outcome study intense rehabilitation fall far behind discipline basic science . This propose research project devote comparative efficacy trial clinimetric study promote evidence-based neurorehabilitation translational research stroke . It call comparative effectiveness research innovative treatment promote evidence-based practice translational science stroke motor rehabilitation . Scientific evidence comparative effectiveness research RR versus MT functional outcome ( e.g. , motor , muscle , sensory , daily function ) adverse physiological response ( e.g. , fatigue oxidative response ) stroke patient limited . More rigorous study need compare efficacy RR MT control intervention ( CI ) , identify predictor treatment success , study change function ( motor , muscle , sensory , daily ) level fatigue oxidative stress intense training order promote translational science movement therapy . Therefore , comparative efficacy research aim perform randomize control trial ( RCT ) ( 1 ) verify efficacy motor control mechanisms dose-matched RR , MT , CI ; ( 2 ) examine whether RR combine FES enhance effect RR ; ( 3 ) study predictor treatment outcomes clinimetric property outcome measure . We hypothesize RR MT group would produce good performance motor control , muscle function , sensory function , daily function , quality life CI group . We hypothesize differential improvement movement performance sensory function RR MT . Combined therapy RR FES ( RR-FES ) enhance effect RR compare RR plus placebo intervention ( RR-PI ) .</detailed_description>
