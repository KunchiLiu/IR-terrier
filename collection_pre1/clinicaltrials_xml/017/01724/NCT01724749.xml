	<brief_summary>The purpose CAMONA study demonstrate feasibility cardiovascular molecular calcification ( CMC ) assessment mean 18F-sodium-fluoride ( 18F-NaF ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) prospective cohort healthy control subject subject cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Molecular Calcification Assessed 18F-NaF PET CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis associate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain significant cause morbidity mortality . Asymptomatic individual moderate high-risk develop acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular event benefit intensive evidence-based medical intervention . The traditional approach identify patient moderate high-risk CVD involve quantify presence CVD risk factor . Based gender , age , smoking , systolic blood pressure cholesterol level , risk stratification algorithm Framingham Risk Score ( FRS ) European SCORE system predict 10-year risk cardiovascular death . However , algorithms associate several limitation , include misclassification woman individual high level single risk factor . The risk underestimated individual . Therefore , individual eligible treatment current criterion CVD prevention guideline . Several study indicate traditional risk score model leave room improvement , work reasonably well population , remain suboptimal individual subject . New risk parameter discover regular basis . One parameter cardiovascular molecular calcification ( CMC ) . This entity detect quantified 18F-NaF PET CT . It hypothesize CMC detect year , maybe even decade , coronary artery calcium scoring ( CACS ) detect conventional imaging modality like multislice CT. Theoretically , tool detect patient early stage disease . Providing evidence-based treatment individual , theoretically , improve prevention CVD . Before hypothesis test , feasibility 18F-NaF PET CT demonstrate healthy control well subject cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
