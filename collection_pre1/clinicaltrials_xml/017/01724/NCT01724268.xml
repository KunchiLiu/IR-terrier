	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) autoimmune disease cause chronic inflammation joint tissue around joint , well organs body . Early diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis early aggressive treatment help prevent joint damage , deformity disability . The management RA rest several principle ; drug treatment , comprise disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDS ) , also non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) glucocorticoid ( GCs ) , well non-pharmacological measure , physical , occupational psychological therapeutic approach , together may lead therapeutic success . However , mainstay RA treatment application DMARDs . Methotrexate ( MTX ) anchor drug management RA use many decade . New highly effective DMARDS continue emerge recent years- particular , biologic agent target tumor necrosis factor , interleukin 1 ( IL -1 ) receptor , IL-6 receptor , B lymphocytes T cell co-stimulation . Furthermore , treatment strategy change period , initially call early referral early institution DMARD treatment basis respective evidence clinical efficacy . The EULAR ( EUROPEAN LEAGUE AGAINST RHEUMATISM ) recommendation treatment rheumatoid arthritis ( 3 ) emphasize treatment aim reach target remission low disease activity ( DAS 28 score ≤ 3.2 ) soon possible every patient ; long target reach , treatment adjust frequent ( every 1-3 month ) strict monitoring . MTX ( 1 ) part first treatment strategy patient active RA MTX contraindication ( intolerance ) present , DMARDs consider . GCs ( 1 ) add low moderately high dos synthetic DMARD monotherapy ( combination synthetic DMARDs ) provide benefit initial short-term treatment , taper rapidly clinically feasible . In systematic review ( 4 ) , GCs find effective relieving sign symptom inhibit radiographic progression , either monotherapy combination therapy . In patient respond insufficiently MTX and/or synthetic DMARDs without GCs , biological DMARDs start ( 1 ) ; current practice would start TNF inhibitor ( adalimumab , certolizumab , etanercept , golimumab infliximab ) combine MTX . In study include GCs management RA , include beginning study ( 1 ) . In recent trial ( 2 ) , Inclusion low-dose prednisone start two-year MTX-based tight control treatment strategy early RA increase effectiveness ( i.e . disease activity variable ) outcome ( i.e . erosive joint damage ) without increase toxicity . It also reduce need ( early ) treatment biologicals . The anti TNF treatment expensive carry risk infection . To knowledge , study compare addition small dos steroid steroid addition anti TNF patient fail tolerate 25 mg MTX . The investigator design study compare efficacy add small dos prednisolone ( 10 mg ) daily efficacy add one available anti TNF patient achieve remission maximum tolerate MTX dose ( 25 mg ) .</detailed_description>
