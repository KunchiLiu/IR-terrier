	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer represent significant health problem United States . This year 179,000 men United States diagnose prostate carcinoma approximately 25 % die disease . In addition , incidence mortality prostate carcinoma increase steadily United States . Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level commonly use biomarker detection prostate cancer . Nonetheless , significant false negative false positive diagnosis since PSA level elevate benign prostatic hyperplasia prostatitis decrease patient take medication herbal remedy . Twenty percent biopsy-proven prostate carcinoma PSA level within normal range , thus confound diagnosis base PSA screen test . Current diagnostic method include transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) TRUS guide prostate biopsy logistically difficult insensitive . These complicate equivocal prostatic biopsy finding prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PIN ) normal PSA high clinical suspicion . A tracer high specificity prostate cancer relate structure cellular level would enhance understanding pathophysiology prostate cancer would contribute detection , localization quantification disease metastases . This information invaluable select appropriate treatment regimen . This study test utility [ F-18 ] FMDHT image prostate cancer evaluate radiotracer differentiate primary prostate cancer prostate gland normal prostate gland . More specifically , study distribution kinetics [ F-18 ] FMDHT normal healthy human patient prostate cancer . As per exploratory IND requirement , perform toxicity assessment FMDHT outside laboratory ( ILS , Inc. ) result study attached Appendix A . Based others data , hypothesize : 1 . [ F-18 ] FMDHT PET/CT distribute initially various normal tissue follow blood flow pattern clear rapidly tissue AR . 2 . [ F-18 ] FMDHT PET/CT detect metastatic disease express AR . 3 . [ F-18 ] FMDHT PET/CT uptake elevate AR-expressing prostate cancer lesion compare surround normal prostate . In order progress [ F-18 ] FMDHT clinic , perform pilot 'first-in-human ' biodistribution study subject without prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
