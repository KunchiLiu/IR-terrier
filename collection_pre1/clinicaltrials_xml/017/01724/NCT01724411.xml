	<brief_title>Satiety Innovation- Study 793 . University Aberdeen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research suggest food structure food composition role play control consumption . Low-energy , high-fibre diet provide physical bulk gastro-intestinal tract sustain fullness way low-volume , energy-dense food . However , study show low long term acceptability probably associate poor palatability . Taste hedonic experience remain main driver consumer choice , immediate sensory aspect food product palatability great salience consumer health promote property . Changing property food merely change oro-sensory property delay gastric empty deal mechanisms critical within-meal satiation early post meal satiety may produce transient suppression hunger unless regularly consume represent benefit deliver nutritional stimulus key part gastro-intestinal tract . The potential manufacture change make food structure variety seem near limitless due numerous advance food technology . Several recent report associate satiety effect fermentable fibre source human dietary study ( Nillson et al. , 2008 , Parnell &amp; Weimer , 2009 , Willis et al 2009 ) . Apparently , large intestine microbiota recovers 'extra ' calorie diet might contributes obesity ( Ley et al. , 2006 , Turnbaugh et al. , 2008 , Cani et al. , 2007 ) . However , different mechanism involve lean obese subject completely resolve ( Duncan et al. , 2008 , Schwiertz et al. , 2010 ) . Recent evidence experimental animal design indicate change gut microbiota composition may associate increase food intake obesity ( Vijay-Kumar et al. , 2010 ) suggest satiety intake influenced specie composition gut microbiota . The propose study address effect develop novel food product process innovation motivation eat , biomarkers satiety , nutrient bioavailability gut health use vivo study validate new vivo approach . Specifically protocol address effect potentially satiate product appetite , appetite biomarkers , particularly influence gut microbiota , tolerance safety product healthy obese overweight volunteer free living condition . This study part major European project launch early 2011 : SATIN , collaborative , large-scale project bring together expertise 18 participant across Europe develop food product novel food process enhance satiety . This short-term human nutrition study comprise cross-over design test either potentially satiety product , resistant starch type 3 ( RS3 ) equivalent amount heterogeneous natural fibre 24 healthy- obese volunteer , age 18-65 year old , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 27 35kg/m2 gender initial 21 day weight-loss programme , free- living condition . Dietary intake , body weight , blood pressure would monitor study . Faecal , urine blood sample collect monitor , glucose , insulin , gut peptide assess metabolite dietary microbial origin .
