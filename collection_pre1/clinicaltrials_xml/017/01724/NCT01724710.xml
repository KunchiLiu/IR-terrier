	<detailed_description>Chronic ulcer common clinical problem . Diabetes peripheral vascular occlusion major reason lead chronic wound healing . Therapeutic method promote wound heal hyperbaric oxygen therapy , vacuum assist therapy photostimulation . Although many treatment one widely accept . The clinical effect uncertainty , high cost inconvenience use main reason . Each year amputation population due chronic ulcer decrease . In order break current medical difficulty , We refer new light therapy technology . Look forward shorten heal time reduce medicine cost . The investigator 's previous animal experiment confirm OLED promote burn wound heal fibroblast proliferation normal Wistar rat . In order find time point dosage effective light therapy . The investigator use cultured human fibroblast vitro study light therapy promote fibroblast proliferation mechanism . Expect clinical application light therapy future accurate effective irradiative time point dosage .</detailed_description>
