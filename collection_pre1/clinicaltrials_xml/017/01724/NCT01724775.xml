	<brief_summary>In 2009 , Prof. Hohenberger propose complete mesocolic excision ( CME ) standardize , principle TME rectal cancer apply colon . More surgeon pay attention rationality surgical approach . However , clinical application research still , particular prospective control study still none . This clinical trial compare CME group non-CME group evaluate outcome safety CME apply clinic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Complete Mesocolic Excision Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Materials Methods : All patient colon cancer undergo elective radical operation . The observation record operation postoperative specimen . Intra-operative photograph take various stage , photograph postoperative specimen . According CME operation keypoints , photographs accept third-party assessment expert group , third-party expert group participate management patient . Both The evaluator research doctor double-blind state . The postoperative patient divide two group accord result assessment . The clinical pathological data patient well follow-up information record collect . 1 . Outcome CME By comparison clinicopathologic variable , precise tissue morphometry two group , prognosis , lymph node harvest removal mesocolic area investigate . Outcomes interest also include disease-free survival , local recurrence-free survival , recurrence rate . In addition , analyzed correlation mesocolic area height , weight , body surface area body mass index . 2 . Safety CME CME group non-CME group compare difference security , include operation time , blood loss , postoperation complication , flatus restoring time , defecation restoring time , drainage removal time , Diet restore time , drainage volume three day surgery , hospital death , exhaust time , hospitalization time hospitalization cost . In addition , feasibility CME techniques surgical approach choice elderly patient also evaluate .</detailed_description>
