	<brief_title>Outcomes Treatment Trapeziometacarpal Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hand osteoarthritis frequent condition middle-aged elderly population prevalence 76 % . After distal interphalangeal joint , trapeziometacarpal joint affect joint hand . Symptoms pain , stiffness , deformity , loss grip strength , well reduction joint mobility , affect overall hand function patient ' quality life . Numerous study evaluate different surgical conservative intervention treat patient trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis ( TMC OA ) intervention find effective reduce pain increase function . To date , little evidence characteristic outcomes patient receive conservative surgical treatment TMC OA . The analysis focus factor contribute either conservative surgical treatment , patient differ regard personal health-related factor . Furthermore , data economic consequence resection interposition suspension arthroplasty available highlight need financial analysis procedure respect benefit patient cost bearer . Besides objective parameter , strength range motion , evaluation patient satisfaction well fulfilment preoperative expectation become increasingly important outcome measure . However , standardize instrument available measure satisfaction , expectation fulfillment TMC OA patient . For measure outcome OA , core set outcome measure OA trial ( hip , knee , hand ) develop OMERACT III conference . It comprise assessment pain , physical function , patient ' global condition joint imaging . Furthermore , evaluation quality life recommend , specific item core set TMC OA patient still remain defined . The main objective study evaluation outcomes follow treatment TMC OA use set variable cover OMERACT category well dimension International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ( ICF ) . Secondary aim analysis determinant patient satisfaction treatment result , evaluation psychometric property Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire ( MHQ ) , yet establish TMC OA patient , well economic impact associate TMC OA . In order achieve objective , prospective cohort study include patient TMC OA conduct , regardless surgery . A total 100 surgically treated patient analyse one-year inclusion period conservatively treat patient also analyse time . Follow examination take place 3 , 6 12 month patient use standardized set objective well subjective outcome measurement include MHQ .</detailed_description>
