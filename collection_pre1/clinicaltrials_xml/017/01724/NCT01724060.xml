	<brief_title>Effects Obesity Treatments Food Preferences Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study investigate effect obesity surgical procedure incretin therapy food preference , satiety , gut hormone , bile acid hepatic glucose output overweight obese patient . As part routine care patient see dietician/diabetes specialist nurse ( DSN ) intervention . Patients ask prospectively complete food diary three consecutive day representative usual dietary intake . The first food diary complete three month two week pre intervention . Another four food diary complete post intervention : one , three month , 6 month one year . Total energy intake macronutrient composition comparison pre post intervention form basis analysis . 20 patient group undergo detail measurement food intake , hunger , satiety , gut hormone bile acid . The research protocol similar previously publish Department Metabolic Medicine , Imperial College , London . Participants fast 12 hour overnight attend study 5 occasion . On occasion venous blood sample take visual analogue score measure 3 hour period use previously publish methodology Samples sample container anonymised collection traceable back individual patient . Urine collect . A qualified medical doctor insert venepuncture cannula arm patient 5ml blood withdrawn baseline , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 180 minute follow ingestion standard 400kcal meal . Ten patient group ( different take part meal study ) undergo measurement hepatic glucose output/insulin resistance euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp ( Metabolic Study ) . To ensure acute caloric restriction affect insulin sensitivity , patient low calorie liquid diet 4-14 day 3-7 day intervention ensure weight stable throughout study . This diet nutritious contains appropriate macronutrients . Such diet frequently use part pre-obesity intervention reduce weight risk . Patients provide investigator detail food diary food consumption period .</detailed_description>
