	<brief_summary>The proposes study 1 . To understand physical activity patient cognitive impairment Taiwan construct validity reliability physical activity questionnaire actigram population . 2 . To understand relation brain structure ( brain tractography rest state functional MRI ) cognitive physical function patient cognitive impairment , capability activity social engagement ( include quality life ) . 3 . To understand efficacy exercise brain structure ( brain tractography rest state functional MRI ) , cognitive physical function , capability activity social engagement ( include quality life ) patient cognitive impairment . The study aim establish data base physical activity patient cognitive impairment Taiwan . We also analyze efficacy exercise ICF model physical function , physical activity social engagement provide optimize design exercise program patient cognitive impairment future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Exercise Training Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There already evidence exercise training delay progression dementia . But effect could see patient cognitive impairment remain unknown . There increase importance delay prevent turn cognitive impairment patient dementia recent year . Thus propose investigate follow issue . 1 . To understand physical activity patient cognitive impairment Taiwan construct validity reliability physical activity questionnaire actigram population . 2 . To understand relation brain structure ( brain tractography rest state functional MRI ) cognitive physical function patient cognitive impairment , capability activity social engagement ( include quality life ) . 3 . To understand efficacy exercise brain structure ( brain tractography rest state functional MRI ) , cognitive physical function , capability activity social engagement ( include quality life ) patient cognitive impairment . The study cross sectional study . We recruit 40 cognitive impairment patient memory clinic National Taiwan University Hospital another 20 healthy control match age gender . We collect actigram physical activity questionnaire 7 day perform analysis reliability validity . We correlation analysis data rest state functional MRI tractography , brain connectivity , plasma Aβ1-40 Aβ1-42 amyloid protein . The study aim establish data base physical activity patient cognitive impairment Taiwan . We also analyze efficacy exercise ICF model physical function , physical activity social engagement provide optimize design exercise program patient cognitive impairment future .</detailed_description>
