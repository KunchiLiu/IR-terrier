	<brief_summary>Studies shoulder , Achilles tendon thumb show satisfactory result regard use GaftJacket . Initial trial thumb show , GraftJacket safely successfully use TMC OA surgery therefore represent acceptable alternative avoid possible donor-site morbidity . However , randomise control trial ( RCT ) outcomes use tendon interposition GraftJacket compare . Only RCT design possible gain evidence advantage one treatment method another . The main objective study comparison two surgical technique TMC OA : The resection interposition suspension arthroplasty use part flexor carpus radialis tendon interpositional material use GraftJacket interpositional material .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GraftJacket Versus Tendon Interposition Trapeziometacarpal Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Besides use flexor carpus radialis tendon , several material serve interposition tissue include Gore-Tex , silicone type metal polymer implant . The use Gore-Tex , silicone metal implant , show carry high complication rate secondary synovitis mechanical failure combine poor patient outcome . A study porcine collagen xenograft terminate prematurely poor outcome adverse immunologic reaction . Another option use allograft , dermal tendon tissue another human donor GraftJacket ( Wright Medical Technology , Inc. , Arlington , TN ) . This product manufacture donated cadaveric tissue treat remove cellular component preserve native collagen scaffold . It thus provide strength integrity native autograft without adverse immunologic response traditional allograft . It compliance American Association Tissue Banks guideline allograft material , classify human tissue transplantation . The GraftJacket show high biocompatibility advantage compare autograft avoid donor site morbidity well decreased surgical time . GraftJacket mainly use repair rotator cuff tear Achilles tendon rupture . No complication report patient show significant improve outcome compare preoperative condition . Although study show methodological limitation due lack control group , result show great potential warrant investigation . In contrast study already conduct Achilles tendon shoulder joint , sparse data concern joint upper extremity elbow hand . Treating TMC OA Eaton stage , lll lV GraftJacket report two study . The patient investigation report significant pain relief , significant improvement regard grip key pinch strength , good ability perform activity daily live ( ADL ) high satisfaction rate . No minimal postoperative complication paraesthesia directly relate GraftJacket report . However , limitation two study acknowledges . Both observational study without control group make impossible conclude approach favourable compare standard technique .</detailed_description>
