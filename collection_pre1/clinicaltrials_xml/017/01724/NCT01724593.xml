	<brief_summary>Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness ( ICU-AW ) well-recognized , important preventable sequelae critical illness , affect 60 % adult ICU patient . ICU-AW associate increased mortality length stay , negatively impact long-term functional outcome quality life affect patient caregiver . While delayed mobilization adversely affect clinical outcome , early rehabilitation critically ill adult population safe , feasible , cost effective , result ventilator free-days well functional outcome hospital discharge . In contrast , paucity research pediatrics . Our research suggest immobilization common critically ill child , rehabilitation delay particularly sick child arguably high risk morbidity . It unclear however , whether delay rehabilitation lead adverse outcome critically ill child , demonstrate adult . Our objective study evaluate immobilization delay rehabilitation negatively impact short-term clinical outcome time functional recovery critically ill child . The investigator hypothesize follow factor may influence functional recovery morbidity critically ill child : - Pre-morbid condition - Age - Time-to-initiation acute rehabilitation - Critical illness disease severity</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall Study objective : 1 . To describe functional recovery follow prolonged immobility delay rehabilitation critically ill child . 2 . To explore predictor impaired functional recovery follow immobilization critically ill child . Prior conduct definitive multi-centre study answer research question achieve study objective , conduct pilot study order demonstrate feasibility .</detailed_description>
