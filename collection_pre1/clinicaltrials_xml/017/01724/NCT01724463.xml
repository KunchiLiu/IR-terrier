	<brief_summary>Thousands child die Sepsis follow routine infection . Many death prevent early recognition focus management . No tool currently available recognize sign early sepsis child . The investigator develop electronic health record-based tool recognize child sepsis early trigger alert hospital caregiver . The caregiver prompt launch focus management bundle stabilize child , prevent deterioration reduce chance sepsis related complication death . The propose study test validity effectiveness electronic tool reduce sepsis mortality rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project : Application Severe Sepsis Electronic Health Record Integrated Screening Tool Management Bundle ( eASSIST-M ) Study Study Type : Prospective Cohort Outcomes Study Background : Early recognition severe sepsis critical institution goal- direct therapy improve patient outcome . Barriers early recognition include lack standardized tool identify child severe sepsis . The investigator study potential impact apply novel Pediatric Severe Sepsis Screening Tool ( PSSST ) integrate Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) facilitate early detection effective management severe sepsis . Population : Patients age 1 month 18 year admit hospital present Emergency Department ( ED ) clinical sign Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) . Primary Hypothesis : Prospective application PSSST electronically integrate EHR accurately diagnose pediatric patient early sign severe sepsis . Primary Outcome Measure : Proportion correctly diagnose patient severe sepsis among present SIRS assess prospectively validate sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value PSSST tool . Secondary Hypothesis 1 : Application PSSST reduce lag-time administration goal-directed sepsis therapy bundle 50 % . Outcome Measure : Time delay diagnostic identification critical therapeutic intervention . Sepsis Recognition Lag Time define time elapse first electronic alert first therapeutic intervention . Therapeutic intervention define Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) , fluid resuscitation , initiation cardiotonic agent , request transfer ICU . Since intent-to-diagnose study , outcomes define compare period precede year . Secondary Hypothesis 2 : Application severe sepsis management bundle reduce mortality morbidity . Outcome Measure : Proportion death study population due severe sepsis . Morbidity define number ventilator day , day vasopressor inotropic agent , day Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) support , need tracheostomy , need Gastrostomy tube . Proposed Study Design : The investigator conduct prospective study patient within ED inpatient unit electronically screen use PSSST 3-year study period . Patients screen use novel electronic track tool design locally , use pre-defined severe sepsis variable validate patient severe sepsis . Patients screen positive severe sepsis use electronic track tool treat prospectively standardize severe sepsis management bundle . Data collect prospectively patient admit ED inpatient unit . For ED inpatient unit , outcomes define compare period precede year . Covariates : Demographic , clinical characteristic sepsis-specific factor could potentially influence effect alert critical intervention . Statistical Analysis : To assess effectiveness tool , compare proportion population variable interest intervention prior period . 1 . To assess efficacy PSSST , compare change time proportion patient diagnose severe sepsis adjust key covariates interest . 2 . To assess effectiveness PSSST reduce treatment delay , compare change Sepsis Recognition Lag Time intervention control period , adjust key covariates interest . 3 . To assess efficacy PSSST reduce mortality , compare change age risk adjust mortality rate time intervention control period . The investigator use robust variance estimate analyse account cluster patient within unit . We also use propensity score control differences patient characteristic diagnostic category .</detailed_description>
