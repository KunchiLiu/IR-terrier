	<brief_summary>The main purpose trial determine material , ceramic composite , best manufacture dental inlay onlays treatment moderate dental substance loss , generally due dental caries . Restorations do use direct Computer Assisted Design Manufacturing ( CAD-CAM ) . Another aim study determine factor influence success restoration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ceramic Versus Composite Treatment Posterior Teeth Inlays Onlays</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>WHO estimate dental caries prevalence 90 % adult worldwide . When tooth substance loss due decay tissue small , fill do dentist directly . When substance loss important , dentist often treat crown , present disadvantage mutilate tooth . An intermediate technique consist manufacture inlay onlay : restoration become common since minimally invasive solution case . Inlays onlays make metal , ceramic composite . Patients tend refuse metallic restoration , dentist generally choose composite ceramic . Composite wear whereas ceramic fracture . Published vitro study provide possible answer material effective clinical study conduct confirm . Material\ 's choice inlay manufacture thus country-based evidence-based ( Most french dentist choose composite US dentist prefer ceramic example ) . The main objective trial compare clinical performance ceramic composite inlays/onlays . Other objective include look prognostic factor restoration validate criterion propose World Dental Federation ( FDI ) evaluate dental restoration .</detailed_description>
