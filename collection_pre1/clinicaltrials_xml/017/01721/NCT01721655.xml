Diuretics use decade baby BPD consider standard care . Patients receive electrolyte supplementation replace electrolytes remove diuretic . Spironolactone good diuretic remove extra fluid , different chlorothiazide furosemide instead remove potassium , actually increase potassium level body . Spironolactone use chlorothiazide try minimize potassium lose ; therefore , reduce electrolyte supplementation need . However , study suggest preterm baby arenÂ´t develop enough appropriately respond spironolactone .

	<detailed_description>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , also know chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , major complication premature birth associate significant morbidity mortality . Bronchopulmonary dysplasia commonly affect preterm infant require prolonged aggressive mechanical ventilation and/or oxygen supplementation . Risk factor associate BPD include degree prematurity , infection , mechanical ventilation , oxygen concentration , nutritional status . Despite significant advance care preterm infant improve survival , incidence BPD fairly static past decade . Diuretics fluid restriction consider mainstay therapy management BPD combat interstitial alveolar edema . Short course furosemide follow long-term therapy use thiazide diuretic concurrent spironolactone show improvement pulmonary function well outcomes . Double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled trial show improvement pulmonary compliance , airway resistance , infant alive discharge , decrease fraction inspire oxygen need furosemide bolus . Spironolactone competitive aldosterone receptor antagonist act distal convolute tubule collect duct facilitate sodium excretion conserve potassium hydrogen ion . Since minimal amount sodium filter glomerulus reach distal tubule , spironolactone consider weak diuretic . Spironolactone primarily use chlorothiazide potassium-sparing effect reduce need electrolyte supplementation . There one prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study compare chlorothiazide without addition spironolactone premature infants chronic lung disease . This study demonstrate difference group need electrolyte supplementation , electrolyte balance , pulmonary function . In addition , preterm infant ' distal tubule may respond inadequately aldosterone ; thereby , limit role spironolactone patient population . In neonatal population , spironolactone primarily use addition chlorothiazide potassium-sparing effect reduce need electrolyte supplementation . However , evidence current practice suggest majority patient still receive electrolyte supplementation . One study evaluate spironolactone 's effect need electrolyte supplementation , publish data primary outcome evaluate spironolactone 's effect quantity electrolyte supplementation . We hypothesize difference amount electrolyte supplementation two group .</detailed_description>
