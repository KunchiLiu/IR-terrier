	<brief_summary>Background : - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) one common inheritable neuropsychiatric disorder . It cause problem attention impulse control . However , genetic component ADHD fully study , include gene interact environment . Researchers want study child adult ADHD . They look genetic , brain structure , environmental factor affect ADHD child adult . Objectives : - To study genetic , brain structure , environmental factor ADHD child adult . Eligibility : - Individuals least 3 year age ADHD . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants interview ADHD . They also complete behavior psychological test . Parents guardians complete test along participant 18 year age . - Participants provide saliva blood sample . - Participants also image study brain . - Participants 25 year age return year repeat test . Those 25 year age one set test . Those start stimulant drug receive behavioral treatment first time also another set test 12 week start treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : This study aim provide novel phenotype genomic study Attention- Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , one common heritable neuropsychiatric disorder . It propose split disorder neurobiologically meaningful entity delineate subgroup base neurobehavioral profile . It also explore factor impact clinical course , focus neural effect treatment role child social environment . POPULATION AND DESIGN : Using prospective longitudinal design , group child adolescents ADHD follow . Additionally , family several member affect ADHD recruit . OUTCOMES : The study link onset clinical course ADHD genotype , brain structure function , behavior child social environment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS : Three year age upper limit age time enrollment . The low limit 3 year age choose difficult diagnose ADHD age , diagnosis reliably make age 3 onwards . As study examines developmental trajectory ADHD adulthood , upper age limit set . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CLINICAL POPULATIONS : Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSMIV ) define ADHD . The DSMIV diagnosis ADHD base Parent Diagnostic Interview Children Adolescents participants 18 year age young Schedule Diagnosis DSM Disorders participants 18 year age . For school age , additional inclusion criterion Conners ' Teacher Hyperactivity rating great 1.5 standard deviation age sexspecific mean . ADHD rarely find isolation comorbidity common . Thus protocol include individual ADHD follow disorder : oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder , anxiety disorder ( generalize anxiety , specific phobia ) , tic disorder , mood disorder ( dysthymia , depression ) ; specific learn disability . In study acute effect treatment include participant ADHD start psychostimulant medication first time ( psychostimulant preparation include ) . We also include participant ADHD receive behavioral management ADHD first time . INCLUSIONS CRITERIA FOR THE FAMILY STUDY : We also include family incidence &gt; 30 % ADHD first , second third degree relative . This level choose well incidence rate ADHD general population ( ~57 % ) . Additional inclusion criterion family proband least one sibling one neither parent affect . We already identify family currently enrol probands least 4 first , second third degree relative current diagnosis ADHD diagnosis childhood ( similar number unaffected relative ) . We recruit family similar density individual affect ADHD . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS : Full scale IQ le 70 . Below level child consider global intellectual disability ( classified DSMIVR mental retardation ) . By definition mean individual consider healthy control . While many individual IQ 70 symptom ADHD , diagnosis complicate problem assess attentional ability . Finally , often issue around ability give inform consent adult global intellectual disability . Birth 32 week gestation . Premature birth profound effect brain function structure . Presence history medical condition know cause alteration cerebral anatomy detectable neuroimaging current accept clinical use . Examples include history stroke , arteriovenous malformation , agenesis corpus callosum , history neurosurgery , hydrocephalus . Genetic syndrome associate well establish alteration gross cerebral structure NF1 , tuberous sclerosis form epilepsy . Children known microdeletion syndrome exclude provide ( 1 ) syndrome know associated alteration cerebral anatomy ( detectable current clinical MRI sequence ) ( 2 ) exclusionary criterion apply global intellectual impairment ( define protocol IQ 70 ) . Data individual microdeletion syndromes however include GWAS due analytic complication . Dental brace ( distort MRI image ) . Metal body contraindication MRI scan . Females pregnant participate MRI scan . They able participate part study complete MRI scan postpartum . For participant 60 year old . Folstein mini mental state examination score 26 great . This widely accept screen test dementia . ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS ONLY : Presence DSMIV psychiatric disorder subject current use psychiatric medication . ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE CLINICAL POPULATION ONLY : Some neuropsychiatric disorder either rare associate profound alteration brain structure function exclude . This include psychotic disorder ( include schizophrenia , psychosis NOS ) bipolar affective disorder ; autism , substance dependence ; dementia .</criteria>
