	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Prospective Trial Dabrafenib With Stereotactic Radiosurgery BRAFV600E Melanoma Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm Phase II clinical trial . All patient receive continuous dose dabrafenib 150 mg PO bid progression disease , withdrawal consent , development intolerable treatment associate toxicity . An MRI perform 28 day treatment dabrafenib . Patients unequivocal disease progression brain time deemed disease progression 4 week . Patients complete response lesion brain continue receive dabrafenib study undergo SRS . For patient stable disease partial tumor response brain , Gamma Knife radiosurgery perform treatment cycle 2 , day 1 ( +/- 3 day , 28 day cycle ) use stereotactic head frame MRI image accordance FDA-approved procedure . Melanoma brain metastasis Cutaneous melanoma aggressive form skin cancer . Worldwide , currently expect approximately 132,000 people diagnose melanoma year 37,000 people expect die disease annually . Brain metastases major source morbidity mortality patient metastatic melanoma approximately 3 4 develop brain metastasis point disease course . The prognosis metastatic melanoma CNS involvement dismal1 , , recently , medical therapy demonstrate clear evidence activity melanoma brain . For patient few 4 brain lesion brain lesion great 3 cm diameter , stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) standard-of-care . By deliver highly focal irradiation melanoma brain metastasis , SRS confer local control rate exceed 80 % lesion 2 cm diameter . However , SRS treat micrometastatic disease brain , new brain metastasis develop approximately half patient treat . Furthermore , local control rate lower lesion large 2 cm diameter . As result , median overall survival melanoma patient treat SRS 7 month . BRAF mutant melanoma The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway critical proliferation pathway many human cancer . This pathway constitutively activate alteration specific protein , include BRAF , phosphorylates MEK1 MEK2 two regulatory serine residue . Approximately 90 % identify BRAF mutation occur human result V600 E/D/Kamino acid substitution . This mutation appear mimic regulatory phophorylation increase BRAF activity approximately 10-fold compare wild type . BRAF mutation identify high frequency specific cancer , include approximately 40-60 % melanoma . The frequency activate mutation pathway addiction lead make mutate BRAF extremely attractive target .</detailed_description>
