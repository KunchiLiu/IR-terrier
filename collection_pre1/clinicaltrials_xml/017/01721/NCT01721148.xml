	<brief_summary>There great need new therapy carcinomas progress respond current therapy . There approve Met target agent standard clinical use . In population subject advance carcinomas unresponsive standard care , base relatively safe , reversible monitorable toxicity profile ASLAN002 non clinical study , potential benefit ASLAN002 outweigh potential risk toxicity . The purpose study identify maximum tolerate dose ASLAN002 subject advance metastatic solid tumour , well define overall safety profile ASLAN002 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Multiple Ascending Dose Study ASLAN002 Subjects With Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study - To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ASLAN002 subject advance metastatic solid tumour - To define overall safety profile ASLAN002 - To assess effect ASLAN002 overall cardiac function measure blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) change , leave ventricular function Secondary : - To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ASLAN002 N-oxide metabolite , follow single multiple dose - To provide preliminary assessment anti-tumour activity , assess Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) change baseline tumour size</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male female subject 18 year age old time write informed consent obtain Subjects advanced metastatic solid tumour either progressed standard therapy standard therapy know Tumour paraffin tissue block 610 unstained slide tissue block biomarker analyse provide screening , available Subjects histologic cytologic diagnosis solid tumour ( nonhematologic ) malignancy Subjects life expectancy least 2 month Subjects prior anticancer treatment permit ( i.e. , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , hormonal , immunotherapy Subjects toxicity relate prior anticancer therapy and/or surgery must either resolve , return baseline deem irreversible . Four ( 4 ) week must elapse surgery and/or last dose prior anticancer therapy initiation study therapy . At least 6 week must elapse prior therapy nitrosoureas , mitomycin C , liposomal doxorubicin . For biologics ( e.g. , monoclonal antibody cetuximab ) extendedrelease formulation , washout period must extend 1 month beyond recommend dose interval ( e.g. , cetuximab , per week + 1 month wash ) Subjects Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ( within 28 day prior enrolment ) Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study least 3 month study manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Post menopausal define : Amenorrhea â‰¥ 12 consecutive month without another cause Irregular menstrual period hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit human chorionic gonadotrophin [ HCG ] ) within 72 hour prior start investigational product ( IP ) . Sexually active fertile men partner childbearing potential must use approve barrier method contraception study least 3 month last dose IP . Subjects ability comply visits/procedures require protocol Subjects able provide write informed consent screen Subjects unable swallow take anything orally Subjects significant underlying cardiac disease include ischaemic heart disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] class IIIIV severity ) prior myocardial infarction , uncontrolled angina within 6 month study entry Congestive cardiac failure within 3 month study entry Documented prior history , evidence symptomatic orthostatic hypotension ( e.g. , orthostatic dizziness light headedness ) screening Uncontrolled hypertension require treatment calciumchannel antagonists betablockers . Subjects require treatment arrhythmia include atrial fibrillation , supraventricular tachycardia previous episode ventricular tachycardia fibrillation ECG abnormality confirm Holter monitor Episodes ventricular tachycardia paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( review Principal Investigator cardiologist ) Subjects receive betablockers , calciumchannel antagonist Class IV antiarrhythmic drug include sotalol amiodarone Subjects know symptomatic brain metastasis . Subjects control brain metastasis ( radiographic progression least 4 week follow radiation and/or surgical treatment neurological sign symptom ) allow . A serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection , would impair ability subject receive protocol therapy . Current recent ( within 3 month ) gastrointestinal disease could impact absorption IP ( i.e. , unmanageable diarrhoea malabsorption time screen ) . Inadequate laboratory finding : Inadequate bone marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500 cells/mm3 Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Haemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL Inadequate hepatic function Inadequate renal function Prothrombin time international normalized ration ) /partial thromboplastin time &gt; 1.5 time ULN Serum sodium , potassium , calcium magnesium level equivalent Grade 1 AE value define Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 Any atrophic macular condition include intermediate advanced agerelated macular degeneration Any gastrointestinal surgery could impact upon absorption IP . Ablative surgery gastroesophageal cancer ( e.g. , gastrectomy ) automatic exclusion Any major surgery within 4 week IP administration Inability venipunctured and/or tolerate venous access History allergy ASLAN002 ( BMS777607 ) chemically related compound Exclusion Criteria ( cont 'd ) : Prohibited treatment and/or therapy : Prior exposure ASLAN002 ( BMS777607 ) Drugs generally accept risk cause Torsade de Pointes , calcium channel blocker , beta blocker , antiarrhythmic agent know inhibit calcium ion channel current . Subjects discontinue medication must washout period least 5 day least 5 halflives drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose ASLAN002 ( BMS777607 ) . Strong CYP2C8 substrate , proton pump inhibitor , H2 blocker . Subjects discontinue medication must washout period least 5 day 5 halflives drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose ASLAN002 ( BMS777607 ) . Exposure investigational drug placebo within 4 week enrollment Women follow sexual reproductive status : WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period 3 month last dose IP WOCBP use prohibit contraceptive method ( i.e. , nonbarrier method ) Women pregnant breastfeed Women positive pregnancy test enrollment prior IP administration Sexually active fertile men use effective birth control ( e.g. , barrier contraceptive ) partner WOCBP Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate Subjects compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious disease ) illness Any sound medical , psychiatric , and/or social reason determine Investigator</criteria>
