	<brief_summary>Emotional Intelligence ( EI ) define ability accurately perceive identify emotion oneself others , understand use emotion enhance cognitive process , effectively manage one 's emotion well others . Two major approach construct emotional intelligence emerge . These two approach broadly define Trait Ability Approaches . The Trait Approach , typically assessed via self-report measure Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory , appear strongly relate exist model personality cop . The major approach EI follow Ability Model , assume EI similar distinct type cognitive intelligence , involve measurement variety skill ability related emotional processing . An understanding neurobiological substrate emotional intelligence begin emerge . One influential theory particularly relevant neurobiology emotional intelligence `` somatic marker hypothesis , '' yet still remain limited understanding neurobiological basis EI . The propose investigation attempt provide comprehensive study date examine behavioral , psychological , functional , brain structural correlate EI . The propose study use neuroimaging technique examine relationship current measure EI , behavioral expression emotionally competent capacity , brain functional response , structural cerebral organization . The specific question address associated hypothesis : 1 . The two major approach EI ( i.e. , Trait vs. Ability ) show modest , though significant positive correlation one another . 2 . EI Trait measure highly correlate measure personality weakly correlate specific skill facial affect identification , emotional decision-making , affectively base judgment , whereas EI Ability measure correlate highly specific emotional skill measure . 3 . During functional MRI affective challenge task , EI score negatively correlate activity within Somatic Marker Circuitry suggest Damasio colleague ( i.e. , ventromedial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , insular cortex ) , suggest neural efficiency hypothesis .</brief_summary>
