	<brief_summary>Total hip replacement ( THR ) highly effective procedure relieve pain restore function . Many different implant use artificial hip joint . Hydroxyapatiteceramic ( HAC ) coat become well establish The JRI Furlong® HAC femoral stem one implant good long term survivorship . The femoral implant use since 1985 publish finding show 97.4 % survivorship mean 17 year follow patient . The Furlong Evolution® design base tried test Furlong HAC modification . This 10 year multicentre clinical surveillance study , aim assess clinical , functional radiological performance Furlong Evolution® Hip stem human patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Furlong Evolution® Hip Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Design : The Furlong Evolution® design base tried test Furlong H.A.C implant modification . It still retain full H.A.C coat much short length . This potentially make easy introduce femoral canal , may result less soft tissue damage lower rate femoral fracture . This would beneficial , revision ( implant replacement ) require later date . This potential characteristic highlight important component determine clinical effectiveness total hip replacement . As per National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) guideline best prosthesis demonstrate revision rate ( rate need replace ) 10 % less 10 year . This regarded current benchmark selection prostheses primary Total Hip Replacement ( THR ) . It also consider reasonable recommend prostheses maximum 3 % revision rate 3 year would indicate performance would subject annual review ( 10 year ) ensure revision rate remain consistent 10year benchmark . The Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel ( ODEP ) establish evaluate data outcome prosthesis provide manufacture inform NHS product compliant benchmark set NICE . Therefore study ODEP compliant multicentre prospective surveillance study Furlong Evolution® Hip Stem assess clinical , functional radiographical performance 10 year period compliance NICE guideline .</detailed_description>
