	<brief_summary>This Phase IV adjunctive treatment dose-optimization study evaluate efficacy , safety , health outcome ezogabine/retigabine immediate release ( IR ) ( GW582892 ) compare placebo adult subject partial-onset seizure ( POS ) . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study compare ezogabine/retigabine IR ( investigator-selected daily dose 600 milligram ( mg ) /day , 750 mg/day , 900 mg/day , 1050 mg/day 1200 mg/day ) placebo . Study drug take three time day ( TID ) equally unequally divide dos . The study design include 10-week ( wk ) Screening ( ≤2 wks ) /Baseline ( 8 wks ) Phase , Titration Phase ( 2 wks ) , Dose-Optimization Phase ( 8 wks ) , Maintenance Phase ( 8 wks ) , Taper/Follow-Up Phase ( 3 wks ) . The total duration study subject approximately 31 wks , minimum approximately 27 wks subject provide reliable 28-day retrospective seizure data . Approximately 280 subject screen approximately 208 subject randomly assign 1 2 treatment group 2:1 ratio ( ezogabine/retigabine IR , placebo ) . Subjects instructed start investigational product ( IP ) day baseline visit . During first week Titration Phase , subject take 300 mg/day ( 100 mg TID ) . During second week , subject take 450 mg/day ( 150 mg/day TID ) . At begin Dose-Optimization Phase ( 3rd week study drug ) subject take 600 mg/day ( 200 mg TID ) one week . Thereafter Dose-Optimization Phase , subject continue increase daily dose 150 mg per week achieve optimal tolerate dose . During phase , investigator may choose subject stay his/her designate dose another week attempt dose increase reach dose 1200 mg/day . In addition , context tolerability issue , subject may reduce precede dose level one week attempt increase dose next scheduled time point subject reach optimal dose . Subjects unable tolerate minimum 600 mg/day discontinue study . The Maintenance Phase begin Week 10 ( Visit 8 ) last 8 week . During Maintenance Phase , subject remain daily TID dose achieve end Dose-Optimization Phase . Seizure type frequency monitor throughout study via Seizure Calendar evaluate study visit . Subjects instruct complete daily Seizure Calendar phase study .</brief_summary>
