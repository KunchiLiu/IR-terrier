	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoke prevalent among Veterans ( 27 % ) general U.S. population ( 21 % ) . Smoking common among people use marijuana caffeine heavily , use menthol cigarette become increasingly common , affect approximately 9 % Veteran population . Recent research group others indicate heavy marijuana caffeine use , use predominantly menthol cigarette , alter brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) density . For propose study , brain imaging PET scanning use determine nicotine receptor density Veteran cigarette smoker without heavy marijuana caffeine use , menthol non-menthol Veteran smoker . Results propose research may implications improve treatment Veterans smoke cigarette specific drug use co-morbidities use menthol cigarette .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite improvement tobacco control , prevalence Tobacco Dependence ( TD ) remain high 27 % among Veterans 21 % among general U.S. population ( ~46 million U.S. adult ) . Both co-morbid substance use menthol cigarette preference important issue contribute great severity TD . Among smoker , lifetime history substance use/dependence common approximately 33 % smoker use primarily menthol cigarette , mean roughly 9 % Veterans smoke menthol . In addition menthol cigarette usage prevalent among Veterans , problem likely worsen time , recent military deployment increase chance smoke initiation marketing menthol cigarette aim roughly age group comprise active military . For substance use/dependence , marijuana ( MJ ) user five time likely non-MJ user smoke tobacco cigarette , regular caffeine user twice likely non-caffeine user smoke cigarette . Cigarette smoke contributes greatly morbidity mortality among patient drug ( alcohol ) dependency , make vital understand well complex relationship drug/alcohol dependence brain nicotine receptor density cigarette smoker . Based prior literature pilot data collect previous Merit Review period , primary hypothesis propose research : 1 ) Participants heavy MJ user higher 4 2* nAChR density thalami ( brain region ) participant heavy MJ user , 2 ) Participants daily heavy caffeine user lower 4 2* nAChR density thalami ( region ) participant heavy daily caffeine user , 3 ) Densities 4 2* nAChRs thalamus ( brain region interest ) high menthol non-menthol cigarette smoker , 4 ) less severity 4 2* nAChR up-regulation baseline ( along clinical factor lesser severity nicotine dependence ) associate well treatment outcomes standard smoke cessation program , include improve likelihood quit and/or decrease smoking . To test hypothesis , cigarette smoker recruit flyer post VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System area smoker likely present . Participants undergo follow sequence procedure : ( 1 ) telephone/in-person screening , ( 2 ) bolus-plus-continuous-infusion 2-FA positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan session , ( 3 ) structural magnetic resonance imaging scan within one week initial PET session , ( 4 ) referral standard 12-week smoking cessation program . Rating scales determination smoking-related symptom collect PET scan procedure . Smoking status measure nicotine exposure metabolism collect study use participant report , exhale carbon monoxide ( CO ) level , urine cotinine level , plasma nicotine , cotinine , 3'-hydroxycotinine level .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Must Veteran cigarette smoker , live within commute distance VA Greater Los Angeles ( west Los Angeles VA campus ) Healthy adult Veterans ( 18 65 year old ) tobacco dependent cigarette smoker ( 10 40 cigarette per day ) meeting criterion Nicotine Dependence define DSMIV criteria109 want quit smoking . Heavy marijuana caffeine use ( define use equivalent &gt; 2 marijuana cigarette per week use least 3 coffee cup equivalent per day ) least past 6 month heavy drug/alcohol use . Ability read , write , give voluntary informed consent . An exhaled CO &gt; 8 ppm study screen visit verify smoking status . Any Axis I diagnosis ( include mood , anxiety , psychotic disorder ) Nicotine , Marijuana , Caffeine Dependence within past 1 year . A current diagnosis ( within past month ) substance abuse/dependence diagnosis ( cocaine , amphetamine , opiates ) . ( Length abstinence verify participant interview chart review initial study visit , typically include information substance abuse treatment history objective verification breathalyzer and/or urine toxicology screen ) . Occasional drug/alcohol use meeting criterion abuse/dependence exclusionary . Any current medication history medical condition might affect central nervous system time scan ( e.g. , current treatment psychotropic medication , history severe head trauma loss consciousness , epilepsy , neurological disease ) . The combination heavy marijuana caffeine use . Unstable cardiovascular disease , severe liver disease , renal insufficiency , might make tolerate study procedure difficult . Routine history physical examination perform initial screen visit insure participant meet study criterion ( Section D4 ) . Pregnancy ( urine pregnancy test obtain woman childbearing potential ) due theoretical risk radiation exposure fetus .</criteria>
