	<brief_summary>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) experience breathe difficulty airways deep lung become narrowed . COPD patient use inhaler drug provide relief breathlessness . However , current inhaler inefficient deliver 'coarse-mist ' drug-droplets reach deep airway . In study , use inhaler 'fine-mist ' drug-droplets , tag radioactive tracer track . We take image lung see fine-mist droplet reach deep airway , assess improves breathe capacity patient . Our research may allow development new , efficient inhaler improve treatment patient COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The purpose research ( `` knowledge gap '' research design fill ) understand fate inhale drug within lung COPD patient . Current inhaler use developed treat asthma , predominantly disease large airway , inhaler may optimal treat COPD patient ( predominantly disease small airway ) . Poor delivery inhale bronchodilator peripheral deep airway may major factor limit clinical benefit provide exist device . The key successful treatment could accurately target inhaled drug diseased lung site , hypothesis protocol test . DESIGN &amp; FUNDING : Dr Omar Usmani develop research protocol study fund UK Government Department Health NIHR ( National Institute Health Research ) , fund lead edge research NHS focus needs patient public aim improve health wealth nation research . The study peer review International Experts field research . PROTOCOL : This protocol two study : Lung DEPOSITION study ( COPD patient Healthy subject ) Lung PHYSIOLOGY study ( COPD patient Asthmatics ) . Each study ( Lung DEPOSITION Lung PHYSIOLOGY ) randomise , double-blind , crossover , ( 7 treatment , control pMDI salbutamol ) , study . Treatments give one dose administration . There interval least 5 day study visit . The Lung DEPOSITION study involve radiolabelled drug treatment . All treatment LUNG PHYSIOLOGY study non-radiolabelled . Salbutamol drug aerosol administer subject visit . Subjects investigator blind 'fine-mist ' aerosol particle size give ( 6 treatment ) . The control arm salbutamol drug aerosol deliver 'coarse mist ' standard meter dose inhaler ( 7th treatment visit ) . RECRUITMENT/SAMPLE SIZE ; The study recruit; Lung DEPOSITION study : 12 mild-moderate COPD patient , 12 healthy subject Lung PHYSIOLOGY study : 26 mild-moderate COPD patient , 13 mild-moderate asthmatic patient INCLUSION / EXCLUSION : At screen vist , one unfairly exclude research , particularly COPD disease old age 65 discriminate . This research therefore reflect 'real world ' COPD .</detailed_description>
