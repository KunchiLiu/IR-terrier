	<criteria>Patients 18 year age old , either gender race / ethnicity , diagnose open angle glaucoma ocular hypertension , opinion investigator enough control monotherapy already receive multiple medication lower IOP . Patients able understand sign inform consent form approve Institutional Review Board . Measurements mean IOP least 1 eye : ≥ 24 mmHg ≤ 36 mmHg timepoint 9am ≥ 21 mmHg ≤ 36 mmHg 11h timepoint Visits Eligibility 1 washout medication reduce IOP . The mean IOP &gt; 36 mmHg timepoint Fertile woman ( surgically sterile postmenopausal least 1 year ) exclude study participation meet following condition : 1. currently pregnant 2. test positive urine pregnancy Screening Visit 3. planning become pregnant study period , 4. breastfeeding , use highly effective contraceptive precaution . Patients angle Schaffer Grade &lt; 2 , measure gonioscopy ( extreme narrow angle complete partial closure ) . Patients ratio cup / disc great 0.80 ( horizontal vertical ) . Patients present loss central visual field impairment . The loss central visual field define serious sensitivity less equal 10 dB least four point two visual field test closest point attachment . Patients safely discontinue use medication ocular IOP reduction minimum 5 day ± 1 day 28 day ± 1 day prior Visit E1 . Chronic inflammatory eye disease , recurrent severe ( ie , scleritis , uveitis , herpetic keratitis ) . Ocular trauma past 6 month . Eye infection inflammation eye last 3 month . Retinal disease clinically significant progressive retinal degeneration , diabetic retinopathy retinal detachment . Best score correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) worse 55 ETDRS letter ( equivalent approximately 20/80 Snellen ) . Another ocular pathology ( include severe dry eye ) may , opinion investigator , prevent administration alphaadrenergic agonist and/or inhibitor topical carbonic anhydrase ( CAI ) . Intraocular surgery within last 6 month . Laser eye surgery last 3 month . Any abnormality prevents reliable applanation tonometry . Any condition include severe illness would make patient , opinion investigator , unsuitable study . History cardiovascular disease ( eg , coronary heart disease , hypertension , Raynaud 's phenomenon , orthostatic hypotension , thromboangiitis ) , cerebrovascular ( eg , cerebral insufficiency ) , active liver kidney , severe , unstable uncontrolled would prevent safe administration alphaadrenergic topic CAI opinion investigator . Related previous concomitant medication Patients recent use ( within 4 week Visit Eligibility 1 ) salicylate therapy high dose ( &gt; 1 g daily ) . Current plan treatment psychotropic drug increase adrenergic response ( eg , desipramine , amitriptyline ) . Concomitant use monoamine oxidase inhibitor . Therapy another investigational agent within 30 day prior Screening Visit . Hypersensitivity drug alphaadrenergic agonist , oral topical CAIs , sulfonamide derivative component study drug opinion investigator . Less 30 day regimen stable administration Screening Visit medication substance administer route use chronically may affect IOP , include among others , βadrenergic block agent . Use ocular hypotensive medication additional topical systemic throughout study . Concomitant use glucocorticoid administer route .</criteria>
