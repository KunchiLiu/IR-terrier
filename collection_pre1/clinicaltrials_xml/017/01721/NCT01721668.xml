	<brief_summary>Improving arm hand function stroke difficult achieve within rehabilitation service provide acute stage often due limit resource health care . While spontaneous recovery plateau 6 month , prolonged disability affect quality life social participation stroke survivor . This study aim improve chronic motor impairment arm hand impairment provide intervention intensive training schedule . This study compare two type rehabilitation intervention use randomize controlled trial . Measurements also take various brain function non-invasively help discover intervention strategy work differently repair brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Arm Hand Functions Chronic Stroke ( CIHR 2012-2015 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After unilateral stroke , incomplete recovery arm hand movement common long-lasting negative effect include increase care give cost overall reduced quality life . Recent evidence suggest novel behavioral intervention could improve motor function sub-acute patient add benefit cognitive brain function . However study address whether chronic stage patient also benefit intervention brain plasticity work course rehabilitation . This study investigate benefit two type intervention method extendable community-based intervention service future . It also examine change integrity motion intervention . Further comparison brain function structure make use magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , non-invasively . These behavioural physiological measure inform mechanism stroke recovery training .</detailed_description>
