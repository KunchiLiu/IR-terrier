	<brief_title>Effect N-acetylcystein Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) one standard therapy acute coronary syndrome . Despite major advance PCI procedure , impaired myocardial perfusion frequently occur primary PCI result large infarct size increase morbidity mortality.Reperfusion injury process result additional death cardiomyocytes suggest oxidative stress contribute factor induce reperfusion injury.During PCI , trauma occur arterial endothelium , cause activation aggregation platelet . It estimate approximately 25 % patient undergoing PCI significant postprocedural creatinine kinase ( CK ) /creatinine kinase myocardial band ( CK-MB ) elevation approximately 50 % patient significant post-procedural troponin elevation . The common complication PCI cell damage cardiomyocyte diagnose postprocedure elevation cardiac marker . N-acetylcystein several positive effect platelet vascular function infarct size . This study randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) evaluate effect N-acetylcystein biomarkers platelet activation coronary reperfusion patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention . Double blind randomized clinical trial 100 patient 2 group ( intervention &amp; control ) conduct . Patients confirm ST-elevation myocardial infarction include study . Patients exclude : emergency cardiac bypass ; cardiogenic shock rescue percutaneous coronary intervention . Patients Intervention group administer 100 mg/kg Iv bolus N-acetylcystein 480mg intracoronary 10mg/kg/h 12 hour percutaneous coronary intervention patient control group receive standard regimen . Primary outcome platelet activation biomarkers assessment 24 hour percutaneous coronary intervention secondary outcome effect N-acetylcystein CK-MB high sensitive Troponin T , 6 12 hour percutaneous coronary intervention.Patients assess coronary blood flow percutaneous coronary intervention use TIMI flow myocardial blush grade . Major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) evaluate secondary endpoint 30 day .</detailed_description>
