	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine early active range motion mini-open rotator cuff repair adult result improve shoulder range motion 6 week 3 month surgery . The secondary objective study determine early mobilization improve disease-specific quality life promote early return work/function . Hypothesis : Adults undergo mini-open rotator cuff repair faster recovery range motion , improved disease specific quality life earlier return work/function allow begin early active range motion compare subject immobilize sling 6 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Mobilization Following Mini-Open Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rotator cuff group four muscle around shoulder . They function provide shoulder mobility power well stability . Rotator cuff tear significant cause pain disability patient . Surgical repair do reconnect torn tendon ( ) bone show effective treatment presence full-thickness tear . The goal Rotator Cuff ( RC ) surgery decrease pain , increase range motion ( ROM ) strength . This do small incision call mini-open . Standard care follow surgical repair place sling 6 week protect repair shoulder tendon . During time ROM exercise do use non-operated arm assistance . No active voluntary movement allow first 6 week . Unfortunately , patient develop shoulder stiffness slow recovery return work daily activity may result increase use cost rehabilitation service . The purpose study determine follow RC repair , patient safely stop wear sling begin active ROM activity daily live early pain comfort allow . A total 190 patient recruit study ( 95/group ) randomly assign one two study group . Patients Group A ( sling 6 week ) wear sling 6 week . Self-assisted ROM exercise allow time , active movement allow 6 week surgery . Patients Group B ( Sling need ) allow remove sling early pain comfort allow . Self-assisted ROM exercise allow time active ROM activity daily live . Patients agree participate see surgeon research coordinator baseline assessment surgery 2 &amp; 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 24 month surgery . Each visit include ROM assessment disease specific quality life questionnaire . Patients also undergo Ultrasound exam minimum 2 year surgery verify integrity RC repair . Differences ROM , questionnaire score , RC integrity adverse event examine two group .</detailed_description>
