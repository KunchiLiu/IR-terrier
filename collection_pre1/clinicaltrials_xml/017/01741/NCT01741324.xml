Vitamin D status assess level metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] , level &lt; 50 nmol/L indicate insufficiency . Despite study indicate vitamin D intake among Swedish child significantly recommendation , little known vitamin D status . The investigator recently find inadequate vitamin D status pre-school child live northern Sweden , especially dark-skinned child winter month despite vitamin D intake meeting recommendation . Overall , 25 % light skin 40 % dark skin child S-25 ( OH ) D &lt; 50 nmol/L ( Öhlund I , unpublished data ) . The aim examine amount vitamin D need maintain increase S-25 ( OH ) D ≥50 nmol/L among 97.5 % participant regardless skin color geographic location ( northern southern Sweden ) . Furthermore investigator examine vitamin D status affect health marker bone density , blood pressure , serum lipid , fatty acid , inflammatory immunological marker mental wellbeing . Children age 5-8 year live either northern ( Umeå ) southern Sweden ( Malmö ) recruit trial November-December 2012 . They randomize vitamin D supplement either 10 25 g per day , Malmö also placebo use three month . The randomization stratify accord skin color ( light dark ) accord method use visual inspection interview parents/guardians . The investigator use 2×2×2 factorial design investigate effect two different dos vitamin D ( 10 µg 25 µg ) child dark light skin color , live northern ( Umeå ) southern ( Malmö ) , Sweden . In order achieve moderate difference group ( effect size 0.25 ) 20 child per group require ( power &gt; 87 % , alpha = 0.05 ) . With estimate dropout 10 % , total 220 child include . At baseline , participant undergo blood sample S-25 ( OH ) D biomarkers , blood pressure anthropometrical measurement , include bone densitometry body composition use air displacement pletysmography , parent answer questionnaire behavioral emotional problem participate child use Child Behavior Checklist . These measurement repeat follow-up February-March 2013 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Different Amounts Vitamin D Supplementation Preschool Children Living Northern Southern Sweden</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D range biological effect public health relevance ( Prentice et al , 2008 ) . Besides well know role mineralization bone teeth , vitamin D also play important role metabolic function , pathogenesis certain disease , e.g . type 1 diabetes , celiac disease , asthma allergy , well prevention cancer ( Holick , 2008 ) . Vitamin D status assess plasma serum level metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D , calcidiol ] reflect sum vitamin D convert skin sunlight exposure dietary source . Several report advocate level &lt; 37 nmol/L denote severe vitamin D deficiency ; level &lt; 50 nmol/L insufficient ; 50-75 nmol/L suboptimal level ≥75nmol/L optimal level ( Dawson-Hughes et al , 2005 , Huh et al , 2008 , Yetley , 2008 ) . In child , suggest cut-off value adequate level 25 ( OH ) D base absence rickets , increase measure bone mineralization maximal suppression parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level ( Greer , 2009 ) . The major source vitamin D dermal biosynthesis catalyze ultraviolet B sunlight ( Cashman et al , 2011 ) . However , winter , northern Sweden limit hour daylight lead reduce sun exposure . Consequently , dietary source vitamin D specific importance region ( Brustad et al , 2007 , Edvardsen et al , 2007 ) . Fatty fish , egg , vitamin D fortify milk margarine main source , mainly supply active form D3 . These important basic food also contain common food allergen . Thus , child food allergy milk , fish , egg increase risk vitamin D deficiency . Several dairy product fortify vitamin D , product form D2 bioactive D3 . Skin color affect capacity form vitamin D3 child dark complexion need 5-10 time sun exposure generate amount vitamin D3 compare fair-skinned child , therefore increase risk vitamin D deficiency exposure sun limit ( Holick , 2005 ) . Recently recommendation protect skin sunshine reduce risk skin cancer later life debate may increase risk vitamin D deficiency ( Stechschulte et al , 2011 ) . Obesity child might another risk factor vitamin D deficiency , since increase proportion available vitamin D may store adipose tissue thus lower S-25 ( OH ) D ( Prentice , 2008 ) . Despite study indicate vitamin D intake among Swedish child adolescent significantly recommendation , little known vitamin D status ( Garemo et al , 2007 , Enghardt et al , 2006 , Öhlund et al , 2010 ) . Furthermore paucity study investigate vitamin D intake status food-allergic adolescent may increase risk vitamin D insufficiency due strict avoidance vitamin D contain food . Recently investigator Dvisum assess Vitamin D status pre-school child ( n=90 ; mean age 54+/-7.1 mo ) , live northern Sweden ( latitude 63° ) half fair skin , half darker complexion . The study group examine first August-September ( late summer ) follow January-February ( winter ) . Skin type , vitamin D intake , anthropometrics , S-25 ( OH ) D parathyroid hormone ( S-PTH ) assess . The investigator find inadequate vitamin D status child live northern Sweden , especially dark-skinned child winter despite vitamin D intake meeting recommendation , prompt strategy improve intake vitamin D population . Overall , 25 % 40 % light dark skin S-25 ( OH ) D &lt; 50 nmol/L . The aim examine amount vitamin D need maintain increase S-25 ( OH ) D ≥50 nmol/L among 97.5 % participant regardless skin color geographic location ( northern southern Sweden ) . Furthermore investigator examine vitamin D status affect health marker bone density , blood pressure , serum lipid , fatty acid inflammatory immunological marker mental wellbeing . In order identify whether difference depend latitude within Sweden , child recruit northern Sweden ( Umeå ) southern Sweden ( Malmo ) . As unclear level serological marker 25 ( OH ) D affect health child , different marker health examine intervention . Children age 5-8 year , 50 % fair-skin 50 % darker skin , northern Sweden ( Umeå ) southern Sweden ( Malmö ) include longitudinal , randomized trial . The child first examine November-December randomize vitamin D supplement either 10 25 g per day , use three month . At follow February-March examination repeat . The investigator use 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design investigate effect two different dos vitamin D ( 10 µg 25 µg ) child dark light skin color , live northern ( Umeå ) southern ( Malmö ) , Sweden . In order achieve moderate difference group ( effect size 0.25 ) require 20 child per group ( power &gt; 87 % , alpha = 0.05 ) . With group size , see group difference S-25 ( OH ) D 3.75 nmol/L , S-PTH 0.35 mmol/L bone mineral density lumbar region 0.075 g/cm2 . In Skåne , Umeå also placebo group participate . With estimate dropout 10 % , total 220 child include . The study include sample analysis S-25 ( OH ) D , calcium , phosphate , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , magnesium , PTH osteocalcin , serum lipid ( total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol . ApoA1 ApoB lipoprotein ) fatty acid well inflammatory immunological marker ( CRP , interleukin ( IL ) -1 2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , I-10 , Il-17 , CD40 ligand , TNF IFNγ , fibrinogen antisecretory factor ) . Before sample , child receive topical anesthetic ( EMLA ) . Measurements blood pressure anthropometric measurement length , weight , waist circumference bone densitometry ( DEXA ) body composition ( fat mass % fat free mass ) use Air Displacement Plethysmography ( BOD POD ) Questions diet , vitamin supplement , foreign travel , much time child spend time outdoors use sunscreen well question child 's health family situation answer parent questionnaire . To investigate possible association vitamin D status mental well-being , investigator use Child Behaviour Checklist ( CBCL ) . This study national multicultural perspective , expect provide knowledge need vitamin D prevent vitamin D deficiency . The study also expect provide good understand association vitamin D status various marker health among child . By prevent vitamin D deficiency , poor bone development , susceptibility infection , perhaps prone autoimmune disease cardiovascular risk factor could reduce , hopefully mental well-being improve , reduce cost society individual , reduces unnecessary suffering individual .</detailed_description>
