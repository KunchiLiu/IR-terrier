	<brief_summary>Computated tomography ( CT ) invaluable medical resource physician surgeon . Contrast medium aid improve diagnostic yield CT . While incredibly powerful mean image human body , possible complication use contrast include hypersensitive response contract induce nephropathy ( CIN ) . The latter typically occur 48-72 hour administration . One recent meta - analysis serum creatinine level follow contrast enhance CT find 6.4 % undergoing investigation develop CIN . Although typically transient , 1 % persisting reduce renal function , small minority need renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . The development CIN influence co morbidity amount contrast give . The mechanism injury kidney definitively establish , think likely due hypoxia result reduce blood flow , thereby give rise oxygen free radical cause direct damage kidney also direct tubular damage . Remote condition ischaemia hypothesize nephroprotective , whereby induced transient ischaemia another site could buffer impact contrast medium 's effect . This first demonstrate cardiac angiogram , patient receive multiple balloon inflation coronary artery find low incidence CIN few balloon inflation . Thus could hypothesise ischaemia temporarily induce could nephroprotective . This point extremity , rather involve central organ , arm , ischaemia induce use blood pressure cuff , inflate systolic blood pressure level . No study find literature attempt demonstrate effect relation contrast CT study . Consequently , randomise control clinical trial patient assess effectiveness remote ischaemic preconditioning propose . Study Hypothesis : That perform remote ischaemic preconditioning undergoing CTs involve IV contrast nephroprotective .</brief_summary>
