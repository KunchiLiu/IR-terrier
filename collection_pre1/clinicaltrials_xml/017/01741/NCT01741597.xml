	<brief_title>Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI Patients With Advanced Breast Pancreatic Cancer With Metastases Liver Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore ability iRGD ( tumor-homing peptide iRGD ) elicit change metastatic breast cancer vascular permeability measure dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI . II . To evaluate pharmacokinetics iRGD . III . To explore safety iRGD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore change water diffusion status tumor due iRGD measure diffusion-weighted ( DWI ) MRI . II . To explore ability iRGD elicit change primary pancreatic cancer vascular permeability measure dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI . III . To explore change water diffusion status primary pancreatic cancer due iRGD measure DWI-MRI . OUTLINE : Patients undergo DCE-MRI day 1 undergo tumor-homing peptide iRGD DCE-MRI day 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 15 day .</detailed_description>
