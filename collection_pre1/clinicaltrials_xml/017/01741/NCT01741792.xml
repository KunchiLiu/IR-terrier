	<brief_title>Clinical Study With Blinatumomab Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DLBCL aggressive malignant disease evolve B-cells affect mainly lymphatic tissue . Due aggressive nature disease characterize fast course lethal without therapy . Potentially curative therapy option available even advance stage . Standard-first line lead high initial response rate ( 85-90 % ) approximate cure rate 50 % patient . Patients refractory early relapse treatment ( 10-15 % ) poor prognosis . Blinatumomab bispecific single-chain antibody derivative CD19 CD3 , design link B-cells T-cells result T-cell activation cytotoxic T-cell response CD19 express cell . This study consist screening period , treatment period , follow-up efficacy survival period . The core study comprise treatment period 30 day last infusion . The first cycle consist continuous intravenous ( CIV ) infusion 8 week . Participants achieve Complete Response ( CR ) Partial Response ( PR ) stable disease first treatment cycle eligible receive second ( consolidation ) cycle treatment 4 week , follow 4-week treatment-free interval . After last treatment cycle , efficacy survival follow-up visit occur 24 month treatment start . Participants relapse follow-up period may receive additional 8 week treatment . Two dose regimen assess study . Stage 1 comprise 2 dose cohort . In Cohort 1 , first 6 participant receive blinatumomab dose-escalating manner : 9 µg/day first week , follow 28 µg/day second week , 112 µg/day remain 6 week treatment Cycle 1 . In Cohort 2 , next 6 participant enrol receive constant dose 112 µg/day blinatumomab . Before initiation stage 2 , pre-planned data monitoring committee ( DMC ) meeting hold assess safety profile Cohort 1 Cohort 2 . The dose regimen favorable benefit-risk profile select Cohort 3 .</detailed_description>
