	<brief_summary>This study highlight validate chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy ( CSMT ) migraine . If method prof effective , provide new non-pharmacological treatment option migraine . This especially important since migraineurs tolerate acute and/or prophylactic medicine , due side effect contraindication due comorbidity diseases others effect . Thus , alternative treatment option warrant . The applied methodology study aim towards high possible research standard . This international study collaboration Akershus University Hospital , University Oslo ( UiO ) , Norway Macquarie University , Australia . The multidisciplinary professional background physiotherapy , chiropractic medicine . By increase methodological quality investigator research high level , investigator see method work guide increase quality chiropractic research future , previous randomize clinical trial ( RCTs ) migraine use methodology show room improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Chiropractic Spinal Manipulative Therapy Efficient Treatment Option Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine characterize unilateral pulsating moderate/severe headache aggravated routine physical activity , accompany photo- and/or phonophobia , nausea sometimes vomit . Migraine exist two form , migraine without aura ( MO ) migraine aura ( MA ) . Aura reversible neurological disturbance vision , sensory and/or speech , occur prior headache . The aura symptom show intra-individual variation . The origin migraine pain still debate , since origin painful impulse trigeminal nerve still uncertain . Some argues central argues peripheral mechanism . Extracranial pain sensitive structure include skin , muscle , artery , periosteum joint . The skin sensitive usual form pain stimuli , especially temporal neck muscle may source pain tenderness migraine . Similarly frontal supraorbital , superficial temporal , posterior occipital artery sensitive pain . It hypothesize CSMT might relieve migraine due stimulation different mechanoreceptors neck zygapophyseal joint , intervertebral disc neck muscle . Numerous study manipulation conduct , one methodological shortcoming , i.e . failure specify diagnostic criterion , inadequate randomization procedure , lack control , lack patient blinding , lack specify primary secondary end point shortcoming statistical evaluation result . A RCTs suggest CSMT use diversified technique effective therapy migraine . The diversified technique use 91 % chiropractor , include collection procedure , hence name diversified . It focus inter-segmental pretension ( soft tissue tension ) prior delivery high velocity low amplitude ( HVLA ) adjustment . The Gonstead method use 59 % chiropractor also base HVLA , major difference minimal usage rotation adjustment contrast diversified technique . The Gonstead method consider safe , since severe adverse reaction encounter . No study previously investigate efficacy Gonstead method migraine , although research CSMT modalities recommend . Study hypothesis CSMT use Gonstead method reduces day migraine least 25 % compare placebo ( sham manipulation , i.e . broad non-specific contact , non-directional , low velocity low amplitude ) intervention ( control group ) . The RCT single blind , placebo-controlled trial CSMT use Gonstead method vs. sham manipulation control group . If treatment show effective , participant receive sham manipulation control offer true intervention follow-up period free charge . This study follow recommendation set clinical trial guideline IHS , methodological quality control general follow previous suggest criterion CONSORT statement . Patients recruit Akershus University Hospital , Norway well medium advertise Akershus Oslo County . The diagnosis set chiropractor neurologist experience headache . In accordance good clinical practice , patient receive write oral information project inform harm benefit well adverse reaction intervention . A total 90 participant need recruit clinical trial . The clinical trial consist three stage : Run-in , intervention ( treatment ) follow-up . One month baseline data collection participant fill-in diagnostic headache diary . Baseline demographic clinical characteristic present table mean standard deviation ( SD ) group . As age gender may play role , participant subdivide four subgroup age gender prior conceal group allocation restrict randomization draw prepare sealed lot . Each lot include three different intervention , i.e active treatment , sham manipulation control group . The first three participant draw lot three intervention use . The next lot three intervention follow next three participant ; participant receive one intervention . The RCT conduct experienced chiropractor . Active treatment consist CSMT use Gonstead method . A specific contact , high velocity , low amplitude , short lever , recoil post adjustment direct spinal biomechanical dysfunction diagnose standard chiropractic test . Follow-up 3 , 6 12 month post-treatment . During period participant continue fill diagnostic headache diary . The control group also include phase study . The data analyze SPSS use standard statistical technique . The investigator base calculation sample size migraine day recent group comparison study topiramate . The investigator calculate sample size 16 patient require group detect difference mean reduction monthly migraine headache day 2.5 80 % power , p=0.05 level significance , assume common SD 2.5 active treatment broad-based treatment group . Insurance `` The Norwegian System Compensation Patients '' ( NPE ) independent national body , set process compensation claim patient suffered injury result treatment Norwegian health service . The Regional Committee Medical Research Ethics ( REK ) Norway Norwegian Social Science Data Services approve full PhD research protocol . The declaration helsinski follow .</detailed_description>
