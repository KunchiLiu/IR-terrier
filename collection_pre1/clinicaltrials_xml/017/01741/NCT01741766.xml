	<brief_summary>Hypertension major risk factor cardiovascular disease . Hypertension abdominal obesity associate dysfunction main mechanism cardiovascular regulation , autonomic nervous system vascular endothelium . Increased sympathetic activity endothelial dysfunction associate increase arterial stiffness , independent risk factor development hypertension cardiovascular disease . The recommended intervention control BP pre- stage 1- hypertensive individual lifestyle modification exercise , drug therapy.Although aerobic resistance exercise show beneficial cardiovascular system , special population elderly obese may physical and/or musculoskeletal limitation may limit participation exercise modality . Stretching form exercise widely recommend injury prevention . Among benefit stretch increased flexibility , enhance muscular coordination , stress relief , improve range motion improve posture . Previous study show stretch training increase arterial compliance acutely increase sympathetic nerve activity . In addition , low flexibility level find associate arterial stiffness . Given stretch skeletal muscle cause increase sympathetic nerve activity ; repetitive stimulation sympathetic activity induce habitual stretching , might chronically reduce rest sympathetic activity . The reduction sympathetic activity might result decrease arterial stiffness blood pressure . The investigator hypothesis 8 week stretch training would reduce arterial stiffness , blood pressure sympathetic activity obese woman . The investigator also hypothesize improved arterial function stretch would associate increase flexibility level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine effect 8 week stretch train blood pressure , arterial stiffness , wave reflection , endothelial function cardiovascular autonomic control . The specific aim study : - To evaluate effect 8 week ST arterial function aortic hemodynamics assess arterial stiffness ( aortic , systemic , leg ) , aortic blood pressure wave reflection , autonomic function ( heart rate variability , vascular sympathetic activity [ low-frequency power systolic BP variability ] , baroreflex sensitivity )</detailed_description>
