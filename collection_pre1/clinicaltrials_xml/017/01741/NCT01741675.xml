In primary analysis investigator estimate relative risk ( RR ) ass whether difference group allocation questionnaire response rate . The investigator adjust age analysis . In secondary analysis investigator test whether score five SDQ scale different group allocation . The investigator adjust covariates age gender , since score may depend age gender ( 4 ) . BACKGROUND Non-responders questionnaire survey may introduce bias low validity study . A Cochrane review identify trial evaluate different way increase response rate ( 1 ) . The odds respond postal questionnaire almost double use monetary incentive , odds high incentive give questionnaire compare give participant respond . However , knowledge none study concern vulnerable child youth . The purpose study investigate monetary incentive increase response rate vulnerable child youth postal survey . A secondary purpose test monetary incentive effect content answer postal survey . METHODS/DESIGN Study design The study randomize control trial .

Randomisation The randomization perform within wave survey . The participant give unique identification number original study number also use present study . The first 3 digit identification number identifies municipality participant last digit give order participant enter original study . Within wave study participant sort accord identification number assign random number 0 1 . The investigator use Rand ( 'uniform ' ) function SAS create randomization sequence . If number le 0.5 participant allocate control otherwise participant allocate treatment . Blinding Neither participant researcher blind intervention . INTERVENTION The intervention group receive postal questionnaire together voucher worth €15 large supermarket chain Denmark . Non-responders three week receive reminder together another copy questionnaire . In case questionnaire send cover letter reply pay return envelope . The control group receive postal questionnaire . Non-responders three week receive reminder together another copy questionnaire . In case questionnaire send cover letter reply pay return envelope . After 10 week duration study period participant control group receive similar voucher intervention group . This do ethical reason , group treat equal .

Consequently , investigator undertake formal power calculation determine sample size . DATA ANALYSIS In primary analysis investigator estimate relative risk ( RR ) ass whether difference group allocation questionnaire response rate . The investigator adjust age analysis . The analysis perform use PROC GENMOD SAS . Level significant 5 % significance level . In secondary analysis investigator test whether score five SDQ scale different group allocation . The investigator adjust covariates age gender , since score may depend age gender ( 4 ) . If score normally distribute investigator use GLM SAS , otherwise investigator use ordinal logistic regression ( PROC GENMOD ) . ETHICS The study register Danish Data Protection Agency .
