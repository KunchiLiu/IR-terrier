	<detailed_description>The hypothesis Sitagliptin improve overall blood glucose , fast blood glucose , glycemic excursion patient Type I Diabetes . In addition , sitagliptin likely suppress index oxidative stress patient . The study investigate propose mechanism improve glucose concentration , include enhanced effect endogenous GLP-1 suppression glucagon .</detailed_description>
