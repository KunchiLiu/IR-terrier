	<detailed_description>Growing body evidence show fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) outperform guaiac fecal occult blood test ( gFOBT ) term sensitivity , neoplasm detection rate public participation . Though direct outcome evidence still lack FIT , anticipate high colorectal cancer ( CRC ) mortality incidence reduction compare gFOBT . In Taiwan , nation-wide CRC screen program launch since year 2004 , provide biennial FIT screening adult age 50 69 year . Currently available data Bureau Health Promotion show significant stage-shift effect , early indicator screen effectiveness , screen program . Nevertheless , aforementioned advantage FIT , miss neoplasms interval cancer still exist current one-day stool sample method biennial screening interval , might affect effectiveness overall screening program . Increase number stool sample shorten screen interval may helpful early detection clinically significant neoplasms remains unclear whether approach may lower screenee compliance public participation . Moreover , impact demand confirmatory colonoscopy cost-effectiveness whole screening program still largely unknown need investigate . In study , firstly aim randomly allocate screen attendee one follow four arm : one-day sample annual screening , one-day sample biennial screening , two-day sample annual screening , two-day sample biennial screening . Participation rate , positive rate FIT , detection rate neoplasm , positive predictive value , long-term outcome include cancer incidence mortality calculate compare among four group . Secondly , Taiwanese population , typical presentation Asian population , although incidence colorectal cancer rapidly increase , Helicobacter pylori-related upper gastrointestinal pathology remain highly prevalent , may imply mass screen solely base FIT could insufficient significant upper GI pathology miss . Since FIT predict upper GI pathology , adjunct an「Helicobacter pylori stool-antigen test ( HpSA ) 」 may potential candidate realize pan-detecting assay base stool sample population low upper GI lesion equally prevalent . Therefore , present study , also evaluate value simultaneous FIT HpSA test community-based mass screening . We invite subject randomize study receive FIT FIT plus HPSA . Those tested positive HPSA receive upper endoscopic examination anti-H. pylorus treatment . For short-term indicator , evaluate participation rate diagnostic yield HPSA add . For long-term indicator , compare incidence mortality gastric cancer well complicate peptic ulcer . To summary , study include two randomized trial : 1 . To make comparison one-day sample annual screening , one-day sample biennial screening , two-day sample annual screening , two-day sample biennial screen use FIT ; 2 . To make comparison FIT plus HpSA FIT alone screen . Finally , cost-effectiveness analysis also conduct use previously establish Markov model CRC natural history stomach disease ( dyspepsia , peptic ulcer disease , gastric cancer ) use result ascertain trial .</detailed_description>
