	<brief_title>The Effect Folic Acid Supplementation Pregnancy Folate Forms Red Blood Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Higher folate requirement pregnancy support growth development well establish unknown metabolic change occur 1-carbon metabolism provide sufficient nucleotide DNA/RNA synthesis . Periconceptual folic acid ( FA ) supplementation fortification food supply show reduce risk pregnancy neural tube defect conversely expose woman high FA intake extend period time . The purpose cross-sectional study establish physiological adaptation occur folate metabolism response pregnancy high intake FA typically consume among woman reproductive period . A convenience sample thirty-two woman ( n=8/group ) recruit compare total concentration form folate ( tetrahydrofolate [ THF ] , 5-methylTHF , 5-formylTHF 5 , 10-methenylTHF ) red blood cell four group : ) pregnant woman ( PW , 30-36 week gestation ) take 1.0 mg FA b ) non-pregnant woman ( NPW ) take 0 mg FA c ) NPW take 1.0 mg FA ) NPW take 5.0 mg FA . Blood sample take single time point compare across group . Total red blood cell concentration measure use microbiological assay liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) analysis . LC/MS/MS analysis use determine folate form concentration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. pregnant woman 30 36 week gestation take 1 mg folic acid multisupplement 2. nonpregnant woman pregnant take either 0 , 1 5 mg folic acid multisupplement Taking medication know interfere folate absorption time sample ( ie . Antibiotics [ enrol study least two week prior study commencement ] , methotrexate , aminopterin ) Those history disorder condition could interfere folate absorption metabolism either dietary supplement source history/presence clinically significant gastrointestinal disease ( chronic diarrhea , inflammatory bowel disease , partial gastrectomy ) , unresolved GI symptom ( diarrhea/vomiting ) , steatorrhea condition interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion folic acid . Those preexisting condition ( preexist maternal diabetes ; insulindependent diabetes ; previous child neural tube disorder ( NTD ) , cleftlip/palate heart defect ; epilepsy and/or seizure disorder ) increase risk pregnancy complicate NTD .</criteria>
