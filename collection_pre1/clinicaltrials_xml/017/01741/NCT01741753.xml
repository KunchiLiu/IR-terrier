	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational drug , case investigational drug combine standard drug therapy . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study taht research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve drug use patient , include people type cancer . BKM120 drug inhibits ability tumor grow survive , may lead good outcomes many type cancer . Abiraterone acetate drug approve treatment prostate cancer , work inhibit enzyme find prostate tumor tissue . While take abiraterone acetate , individual must also take glucocorticoid prednisone . Most patient castrate-resistant prostate cancer receive treatment docetaxel , treatment combination abiraterone prednisone show effective . Evidence show interaction pathway BKM120 abiraterone act cancer . Therefore , think treatment castrate-resistant prostate cancer enhance combine BKM120 abiraterone plus prednisone . The purpose study determine safe dose combination daily oral BKM120 , abiraterone acetate , prednisone patient castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer receive prior treatment docetaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BKM120+Abiraterone Acetate Metastatic CRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You undergo screen process determine eligible participate trial . This process include follow procedure : Tumor Biopsy , include bone marrow biopsy , use determine kind cancer cell tumor Physical Examination , include weight , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate body temperature . Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant docetaxel resistant CRPC , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . If take part research study , give study drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . There 14 day lead phase BKM120 alone assess toxicity agent . After lead phase , standard dose abiraterone prednisone add BKM120 treatment regimen . Treatment cycle last 4 week ( 28 day ) , time take study drug combination standard drug therapy daily . Your time participation study base well tolerate experimental drug . You could participate study period day , year , depend course cancer . During treatment cycle , required return see research doctor study visit Day 1 cycle . For Cycle 1 , also need return Days 8 , 15 22 . The following procedure perform sample collect 1 study visit : Evaluation side effect , Vital sign measurement , Heart function test , Neuropsychologic exams , Performance status assessment , Tumor biopsy , Assessment tumor , Blood sample . We would like keep track medical condition rest life . We would like call telephone year see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long-term effect research study . You required return see research doctor end study visit , take place 4-8 week undergo prostatectomy .</detailed_description>
