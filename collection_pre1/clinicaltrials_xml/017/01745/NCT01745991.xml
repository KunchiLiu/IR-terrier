	<brief_summary>The investigator plan invite child UK biliary atresia , treat three national centre ( Birmingham , Kings College Leeds ) , three year period take part randomise control study . The investigator aim determine effectiveness CoSeal® Surgical Sealant ( anti-adhesive agent ) reduce intra-abdominal adhesion ( scar tissue ) morbidity cause adhesion child treat Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy . Adhesions common , invariable , abdominal surgery . They cause intra-abdominal organ become stuck abdominal wall . This mean longer completely free slide . In particular patient lifetime risk bowel become kink twisted leading complication bowel obstruction . Adhesions also make repeat abdominal operation difficult . The adhesion divide order separate organ abdominal wall . This lead blood loss increase risk damage organ . Anti-adhesive agent create reduce severity adhesion , little medical literature evaluate effectiveness , particularly child . Biliary atresia obliterative obstruction bile ducts occurs infant . Initially treated abdominal operation call Kasai portoenterostomy restore bile flow liver intestine . However approximately 40 % child go require liver transplant operation first two year life . If CoSeal® Surgical Sealant effective could reduce patient lifetime risk complication abdominal adhesion also facilitate repeat abdominal operation child , particular go require liver transplant .</brief_summary>
