	<brief_title>Compare Knob-tipped Knife With Needle Knife Difficult Biliary Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Precut sphincterotomy alternative technique use facilitate CBD cannulation follow failure conventional bile duct cannulation . Needle knife papillotomy widely practice precut technique . However , Pre-cutting papilla needle-knife difficult , require experience dexterity control axis depth cut . Due increase rate complication associate procedure , include pancreatitis , hemorrhage , perforation , recommend perform experienced endoscopists . The knob-tipped knife , novel instrument utilize 2mm 1.5mm cut knife , usually use endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) . Its knob-shaped tip nonadjustable length make knife less likely slip penetrate tissue resection . Since process precut papillotomy similar ESD , precutting procedure knob-tipped knife may easier perform , well safe . The efficacy safety instrument precut papillotomy report . We therefore assessed efficacy safety knob-tipped knife precut papillotomy difficult CBD cannulation .</detailed_description>
