	<brief_title>Closed Vitrification Oocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cryotop method oocyte vitrification classify `` open system '' , mean require direct contact liquid nitrogen vitrification process . The system external straw protect sample storage , device hermetically seal . Instead close system device hermetically seal vitrification remain sealed storage . Open system prove highly effective achieve similar outcome vitrify oocyte compare achieve fresh one . On contrary , close system fail effective open one use oocyte vitrification . Although open system prove highly efficient , many method fail , related theoretical risk contamination due direct contact liquid nitrogen . Though date report case transmission disease cryo-transfers either slow freezing vitrification , European country prohibit use open system vitrification . In study , evaluate result donor oocyte vitrification , use modification current device ( CryotopÂ® ) , make capable hermetically seal . The current study prospective randomize trial aim assess outcome ovum donation cycle conduct vitrified oocyte use closed device versus oocytes vitrified use traditional open device .</detailed_description>
