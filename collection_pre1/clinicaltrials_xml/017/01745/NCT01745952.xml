	<brief_summary>The investigator treat patient fully characterize refractory unifocal neocortical epilepsy technique delivers magnetic wave ( transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ) region cause epilepsy . Active rTMS apply epileptogenic focus reduce seizure frequency compare sham rTMS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Difficult Control Focal Epilepsy With Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background study aim Epilepsy disease cause repetitive seizure . In 60 % people epilepsy , seizure start small zone brain ( focal partial epilepsy ) . This zone depth temporal lobe ( mesial temporal lobe epilepsy ) another brain region ( neocortical epilepsy ) . Even optimal medical care , 30 % people epilepsy continue seizure . The investigator treat people neocortical partial epilepsy technique delivers magnetic wave ( transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ) region cause epilepsy . The investigator good reason believe few seizure several week treatment . 2. Who participate ? You neocortical focal epilepsy . A doctor specialize epilepsy make diagnosis . You least one seizure record epilepsy monitoring unit . You MRI scan brain . You deliver u result test . You continue 4 seizure month . You try least two different scheme anti-epileptic drug prescribe doctor scheme well tolerate . Nevertheless never cure seizure . You old 16 year . You n't plan become pregnant study . You need faithfully continue treatment prescribed doctor n't change drug take least 4 week study 8 week last TMS session . You need able keep diary seizure . 3 . What study involve ? You need come hospital every weekday two consecutive week , every three month nine month TMS-treatment . So three treatment session . You brain scan ( FDG-PET ) first treatment session . The magnetic pulse deliver differently three treatment session : rather small area brain , large brain area use dummy coil , i.e . two active treatment session one dummy placebo session . The investigator tell order deliver treatment . 4 . What possible benefit risk participate ? The investigator good reason believe few seizure week follow active treatment .</detailed_description>
