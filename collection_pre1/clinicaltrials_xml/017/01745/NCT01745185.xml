	<brief_summary>This study prospective active comparator study ass immune response elicit human recombinant agalsidase therapy subject switch agalsidase alfa agalsidase beta Fabry disease . Fabry disease X-linked lysosomal storage disorder , due deficient alpha-galactosidase A activity . The progressive accumulation globotriaosylceramide ( GL-3 ) lysosomes vascular endothelial cell multiple organ system like kidney , heart , skin , brain , lead microvascular disease . In Fabry disease , nephropathy dominate renal function impairment occur result accumulation GL-3 renal cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response Subjects With Fabry Disease Who Are Switching From Agalsidase Alfa Agalsidase Beta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinically , development immune response anticipate number patient treat recombinant human protein suggest common especially native protein deficient absent many male patient Fabry disease . The immune response result development antibody infuse protein may affect clinical outcome enzyme replacement therapy development hypersensitivity , anaphylactoid , febrile reaction , may lead development cytokine release generalize inflammatory response immune complex formation . Furthermore , mount immune response may lead inactivation degradation recombinant enzyme may change pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property therapeutic protein . The different rate antibody formation agalsidase alfa agalsidases beta often attributed difference technique use measure antibody formation . However , factor host , structural similarity infuse protein tertiary structural difference glycosylation may lead difference immune response . Among factor may affect host response also dose infusion frequency . Although agalsidase alfa beta derive complementary DNA sequence minor difference glycosylation pattern , different dosing use , 0.2 mg per kg every week agalsidase alfa , 1.0 mg per kg agalsidase beta . The investigator hypothesize although observation antibody exhibit vitro neutralizing capacity may suggest presence single immunogenic epitope human recombinant alpha-galactosidases , immunogenicity may similar agalsidase alfa beta , thus difference immune response determine host factor escalate dose infused protein .</detailed_description>
