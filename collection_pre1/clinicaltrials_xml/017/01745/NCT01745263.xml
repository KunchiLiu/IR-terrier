	<brief_summary>The European population age rapidly pose challenge individual , European society , health care system . Among promising public health intervention may extend healthy life expectancy old age vitamin D , marine omega-3 fatty acid physical exercise . However , individual combine effect yet confirm clinical trial . The broad aim DO-HEALTH prolong healthy life expectancy European senior . The specific aim establish whether vitamin D , omega-3 fatty acid , simple home exercise program prevent disease old age . To achieve aim , DO-HEALTH enroll 2152 community-dwelling men woman 70 year old , age chronic disease increase substantially . The DO-HEALTH senior recruit 7 European city ( Zurich , Basel , Geneva , Toulouse , Berlin , Innsbruck Coimbra ) randomize 2x2x2 factorial design trial simple home exercise program and/or vitamin D , and/or omega-3 fatty acid , 3 year period . This allow test individual combine benefit intervention prevention 5 primary endpoint : risk incident non-vertebral fracture ; risk functional decline ; risk blood pressure increase ; risk cognitive decline ; rate infection . Key secondary endpoint include risk hip fracture , rate fall , pain symptomatic knee osteoarthritis , gastro-intestinal symptom , mental oral health , quality life , life-expectancy . All clinical endpoint support large DO-HEALTH biomarker study evaluate effect intervention cellular level multi-organ function . DO-HEALTH evaluate reason senior adhere 3 intervention , assess cost-benefit health economic model base document health care utilization observe incidence chronic disease . website DO-HEALTH : http : //do-health.eu/wordpress/ website EC : http : //ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/human-development-and-ageing/projects/do-health_en.html</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DO-HEALTH / Vitamin D3 - Omega3 - Home Exercise - Healthy Ageing Longevity Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 3 primary treatment comparison : 1 . 2000 IU vitamin D per day compare placebo ( control treatment strategy ) 2 . 1 gram omega-3 fatty acid ( EPA+DHA , ratio 1:2 , marine algae ) compare placebo ( control treatment strategy ) 3 . Home exercise program ( muscle strength ) 30 minute 3 time week compare control exercise program ( joint flexibility ) 30 minute 3 time week Follow-up : DO-HEALTH senior follow 3 year , in-person , 3-monthly interval ( 4 clinical visit 9 phone call ) 7 recruitment center . Study population : DO-HEALTH enroll senior age 70 year old . To represent large part senior population , DO-HEALTH recruit community-dwelling senior . However , represent also pre-frail population risk institutionalization , 50 % senior enrol base fall without fracture year DO-HEALTH enrolment . Study Design : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2×2×2 factorial design clinical trial . Recruitment Centers : The trial perform 7 recruitment center locate 5 country : Switzerland ( University Zurich , Basel University Hospital , Geneva University Hospital ) , France ( University Toulouse Hospital Centre ) , Germany ( Charité Berlin ) , Portugal ( University Coimbra ) , Austria ( Innsbruck Medical University ) . Randomization : Stratified block randomization . Labeling study intervention perform central randomization centre Switzerland . Stratification variable : recruitment centre ( 7 center ) , fall previous 12 month ( yes/no ) , gender , age ( 70 - 84 85+ ) . Even balance among fell fall last year enforce 7 recruitment center . Gender age distribution monitor within recruitment centre DO-HEALTH randomization software . If gross imbalance ( le 30 % participant stratum ) detect within centre , recruitment strategy centre adapt boost recruitment participant underrepresented category . website DO-HEALTH : http : //do-health.eu/wordpress/ website EC : http : //ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/human-development-and-ageing/projects/do-health_en.html</detailed_description>
