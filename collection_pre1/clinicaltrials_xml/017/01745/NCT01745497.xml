	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) characterize difficulty language , social communication , repetitive restrict behavior . ASD affect many 1 90-150 child . Sleep issues/insomnia common child ASD ( 50-80 % ) . Insomnia negative impact developmental behavioral function child quality life family . Causes insomnia child ASD multifactorial difficult treat effectively . Low iron store , manifest low serum ferritin level , also common child ASD . Both insomnia low iron store associate Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) Periodic Limb Movement Sleep ( PLMS ) . Children ASD often difficulty communicate symptom tolerate Polysomnography ( Sleep Study ) . This make establish diagnosis RLS PLMS difficult child ASD . Because polysomnography well tolerated child ASD measure sleep time natural environment , improvement sleep treatment iron measure standard actigraphy ( watch measure movement sleep ) sleep diary . The investigator also propose evaluate periodic limb movement index ( PLMI ) predictor response iron treatment insomnia child ASD , measure PAM-RL , actigraph design measure PLMS . The investigator collect secondary data regard attention behavior course study monitor improvement daytime function group . Many clinician empirically treat child ASD , insomnia low ferritin level ( &lt; 50ng/ml ) iron . This base data previous open label trial demonstrate subjective improvement restless sleep child ASD low/low normal ferritin level treat iron . In order evaluate efficacy treatment , The investigator propose randomize placebo-controlled trial oral elemental iron treatment insomnia child ASD ferritin level low laboratory cut deficiency . This study evaluate effectiveness treatment insomnia oral ferrous sulfate ( iron ) dose 3mg/kg divided twice per day 3 month compare placebo .</detailed_description>
