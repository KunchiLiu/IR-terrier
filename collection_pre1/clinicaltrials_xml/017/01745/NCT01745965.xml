	<brief_summary>Trial optimize neoadjuvant therapy HER overexpression co-expressing hormone receptor ( ER and/or PR ) breast cancer ( HEr2+/HR+ ) . A new high potential trastuzumab conjugate T-DM1 ( trastuzumab link cytotoxic agent mertansine DM1 ) test endocrine therapy without standard arm trastuzumab endocrine therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective , Randomized Multicenter , Open-label Comparison Preoperative Trastuzumab Emtansine ( T-DM1 ) With Without Standard Endocrine Therapy vs. Trastuzumab With Standard Endocrine Therapy Given Twelve Weeks Patients With Operable HER2+/HR+ Breast Cancer Within ADAPT Protocol .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>neoadjuvant therapy Patients HER2+/HR+ ( HER2+ ER+ and/or PR+ ) tumor receive single agent T-DM1 12 week ( 3,6 mg/kg q3w ) without standard endocrine therapy ( tamoxifen premenopausal woman aromatase inhibitor postmenopausal woman , contraindication present , standard daily dosage ) . The control group receive trastuzumab 3-weekly schedule ( 8 mg/kg load dose 6 mg/kg q3w ) combination standard endocrine therapy , contraindication existent .</detailed_description>
