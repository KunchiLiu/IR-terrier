	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate use Hydroxypropyl Cellulose ( HPC ) substitute traditional protein supplement ( Synthetic Serum Substitute ; SSS ) Trehalose substitute widely use sugar ( Sucrose ) vitrification solution employ oocyte vitrification .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Synthetic Macromolecule ( Hydroxypropyl Cellulose ) Trehalose Additives Oocyte Vitrification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitrification involve transformation aqueous solution viscous solid avoid ice formation . To achieve , vitrification protocol include high concentration cryoprotectants dissolve base medium supplement serum rich protein . Traditionally available preparation contain human albumin ( HSA ) . The commonly used vitrification solution synthetic serum replacement ( SSS ) consist synthetic glycoporoteins HSA . The replacement human albumin fully synthetic component enable compliance European directives classification Class III medical device accordance Manual Classification Medical Devices regulatory framework European community , therefore medium European CE conformity marking ( Directive 93/42/EEC ) . According European regulation , Class III medical device subject special supervision require certification exam design type examination notify body . Commercial medium supply Kitazato supply Â® ( Tokyo , Japan ) use study submit whole process evaluation certification notify body BSI0086 . Because physical property hydroxypropyl cellulose ( HPC ) , fully synthetic macromolecule , include ability form viscous gel low temperature , macromolecule propose substitute human origin albumin ( HSA ) . Another necessary component vitrification medium sucrose , act osmotic agent . Trehalose , disaccharide present nature use certain specie survive extreme condition , able remain vitrified year . This sugar also employ previously cryobiology vitrification protocol . We test HPC threhalose oocyte vitrification pilot study , show impairment survival rate , embryo development pregnancy rate . The current study prospective randomize trial aim assess outcome ovum donation cycle conduct vitrified oocyte use HPC trehalose versus oocyte vitrify use traditional available solution contain HAS sucrose .</detailed_description>
