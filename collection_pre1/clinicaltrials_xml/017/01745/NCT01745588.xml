	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether pomalidomide ( also know Pomalyst ) reduce number myeloma cell bone , see best way use pomalidomide patient myeloma . To , investigator want compare two type treatment use pomalidomde . This randomized trial mean decision treatment patient receive make computer , much like flip coin . All patient start receive 4 cycle clarithromycin , pomalidomide dexamethasone ( ClaPD ) . After 4 cycle , half patient undergo autologous stem cell transplant follow pomalidomide ( Group 1 ) . The half patient continue receive ClaPD 9 cycle follow pomalidomide maintenance . ( Group 2 ) . At end study , two group compare see difference disease outcome .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm relapsed multiple myeloma define International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) . Patients must measurable disease define International Uniform Response Criteria , define follow : serum Mprotein ≥ 500mg/dL urine Mprotein ≥ 200mg/ 24 hour involve free light chain ≥ 10mg/dL provide serum free light chain ratio abnormal Patients must previous autoSCT perform part consolidation initial remission remission , define partial response great last least 12 month either maintenance therapy without evidence progression define IMWG criterion . Patients post autoSCT primary therapy must receive maintenance therapy lenalidomide . Patients must register within 6 month last dose lenalidomide . Minimum 3 month maintenance therapy prior disease progression . Age ≥ 18 year . Life expectancy ≥12 week . KPS ≥ 70 ECOG &lt; 1 ( Appendix IV ) Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : ANC ≥ 750/μL Platelets≥ 50,000/μL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 3 X upper limit normal . ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 X upper limit normal . Cardiac Ejection Fraction ≥ 40 % Serum Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Patients must adequate number CD34+ stem cell collect allow transplantation ( define ≥ 2x10^6 CD34+ cell / kg body weight ) . If previously collect store previous collection inadequate , patient must willing undergo stem cell mobilization collection per standard practice . Patients participate study must willing able tolerate prophylactic anticoagulation either aspirin , lowmolecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , warfarin .

Females reproductive potential must adhere scheduled pregnancy test require POMALYST REMS™ program . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) † must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 day within 24 hour prior prescribe pomalidomide ( prescription must fill within 7 day ) must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take pomalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . All patient must counsel minimum every 28 day pregnancy precaution risk fetal exposure . A female childbearing potential sexually mature female : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) .
