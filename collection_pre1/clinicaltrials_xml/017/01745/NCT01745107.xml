	<brief_title>Efficacy Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy After Surgery Early Stage Esophageal Carcinoma ;</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although preoperative chemoradiation therapy follow surgery common approach patient resectable esophageal cancer , considerable number esophageal cancer patient receive operation first treatment modality . Accordingly , postoperative treatment play important role poor survival rate patient treated resection alone . The exist data show 5-yeal survival rate stage T2-3N0M0 ( UICC 7th edition ) thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( TESCC ) surgery 50 % , locoregional lymph node metastases responsible main cause failure distal metastasis account relatively less ratio . Therefore , subclinical residual tumor affirmative even early disease undergone curable excision local adjuvant treatment may essential . While proved value prophylactic radiation therapy radical esophagectomy esophageal carcinoma positive lymph node metastases stage Ⅲ disease , still lack clear evidence prophylactic radiation therapy stage T2-3N0M0 disease . The comparison conventional 2-dimensional radiotherapy operation versus surgery alone show statistically significant difference stage T2-3N0M0 disease previous report . In precise radiotherapy setting , evidence non-randomised control study indicate trend preliminary result dosimetric advantage IMRT translate substantive benefit survival locoregional control compare 3- dimensional conformal 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy treatment esophageal carcinoma , remain confirmed randomize control study whether IMRT effective improve clinical outcome stage T2-3N0M0 patient TESCC . In view , design randomize control trial determine clinical efficacy toxicity prophylactic IMRT surgery stage T2-3N0M0 disease TESCC .</detailed_description>
