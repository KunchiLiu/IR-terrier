	<brief_summary>Ischaemic stroke ( cause blockage artery brain cause blood clot ) treat early use clot-busting ( thrombolytic ) drug attempt restore blood supply limit damage , result increased proportion people make recovery independence stroke . However , drug treatment succeed restore blood flow minority people clot large artery ( 10-25 % depend size blood vessel ) people also severe stroke high risk death dependence result stroke . Current best treatment therefore least effective group severe stroke . Devices feed blood vessel either remove break blood clot brain vessel open type large artery blockage . However , use device highly skilled procedure take time set necessary facility ( include anaesthetic , nurse medical support ) reach blockage . The extra time require use device may mean brain tissue already irreversibly damage . If , individual patient benefit indeed may harm open artery . There complete clinical trial compare outcome people treat standard stroke treatment treat device . PISTE randomise , control trial test whether additional mechanical thrombectomy device treatment improve functional outcome patient large artery occlusion give IV thrombolytic drug treatment standard care .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis supratentorial acute ischaemic stroke Male nonpregnant female ≥18 year age Clinically significant neurological deficit NIHSS score ≥6 . Eligible IV rtPA accord standard guideline able commenced IV treatment &lt; 4.5h symptom onset . Enrolment , randomisation procedure commencement ( groin puncture ) possible within 90 minute start IV rtPA treatment ( groin puncture maximum 5.5h stroke onset ) . Occlusion main middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) trunk , MCA bifurcation intracranial internal carotid artery ( carotidT , M1 single proximal M2 branch ) demonstrate CTA , MRA , DSA . Interventional device delivery ( guide catheter place beyond aortic arch angio obtain ) achieve within 6 hour onset stroke . Consent patient representative . Independent prior stroke ( estimate mRS 02 ) Expected able follow 3 month CT evidence intracranial haemorrhage , evidence extensive establish hypodensity CT. Clinical history suggestive subarachnoid haemorrhage even CT normal . Known vascular access contraindication e.g . femoral bypass surgery , tight ipsilateral carotid stenosis , unsuitable proximal vascular anatomy likely render endovascular catheterisation difficult impossible . Extracranial ICA occlusion basilar artery occlusion Alternative intracranial pathology potentially responsible new symptom Medical comorbidities would preclude safe cerebral vessel catheterisation expect limit life expectancy &lt; 3 month ( eg severe cardiac , renal hepatic failure , significant coagulopathy , metastatic malignancy ) Known allergy radiological contrast</criteria>
