	<brief_summary>Chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) infection complicate cirrhosis liver cancer . In Thailand , 7 % adult chronically infect Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . The risk perinatal transmission HBV 12 % mother high HBV load plasma , even infant receive specific immunoglobulin vaccine . The hypothesis study potent antiviral , tenofovir , decrease HBV load HBV infect pregnant woman therefore reduce risk perinatal transmission/ Pregnant woman participate study receive tenofovir placebo last trim pregnancy two month postpartum . The risk perinatal transmission compare two group . The result study help define policy manage HBV infect pregnant woman prevent perinatal transmission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal Antiviral Prophylaxis Prevent Perinatal Transmission Hepatitis B Virus Thailand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III , placebo control , double blind , randomize clinical trial ass efficacy safety tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) give 28 week ' gestation 2 month postpartum pregnant woman Hepatitis B ( HB ) virus ( HBV ) chronic infection positive HB e antigen prevent perinatal transmission HBV infant . All infant receive HBV passive ( HB specific immunoglobulin ) active ( vaccine ) immunization . Chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) infection complicate cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , 10th lead cause death worldwide . In 2011 , 7 % adult Thailand HBsAg carrier . Infant hepatitis B ( HB ) immunization HB immune globulin ( HBIg ) administer birth effectively prevent mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HBV . However , 12 % mother high load HBV transmit virus infant , despite active passive immunization . Studies suggest antiviral treatment end pregnancy early postpartum reduce risk transmission child . A potential limitation approach risk hepatic disease exacerbation follow discontinuation antiviral treatment postpartum , risk properly evaluate . No randomized clinical trial adequately demonstrate efficacy safety maternal antiviral treatment prevention mother child transmission HBV . This reason approach currently recommend Associations Study Liver Diseases . We hypothesize potent antiviral , tenofovir , decrease HBV viral load HBV infect pregnant woman therefore reduce risk perinatal transmission , infant definitely protect passive-active immunization . We also hypothesize moderate exacerbation liver disease observe discontinuation short antiviral course ( 5 month ) . While primary objective study ass efficacy tenofovir versus placebo prevention perinatal transmission , important secondary objective assessment risk postpartum hepatic disease exacerbation . Within 2 year , 328 woman infant enrol public hospital Thailand randomize receive either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate match placebo 28 week pregnancy 2 month postpartum . Mothers infants follow one year postpartum . The primary endpoint detection HBsAg HBV DNA infant six month life . An interim analysis conduct half outcome available .</detailed_description>
