	<detailed_description>Primary objective : -To compare rate grade 2 high pneumonitis amongst patient stage III NSCLC treat radiotherapy use SPECT radiotherapy treatment plan versus standard CT-based radiotherapy planning ; Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate SPECT tool predict lung toxicity ; - To establish estimate incidence severity pulmonary tissue effect observe stage III NSCLC patient treat radiotherapy ; - To generate hypothesis subsequent use SPECT-CT-based treatment planning method minimization toxicity risk - To generate hypothesis model study SPECT-CT-based treatment plan dose-escalation ; - To compare loco-regional control , time progression overall survival patient treat SPECT-based plan versus standard CT-based plan - To compare quality life patient randomize two study arm . This trial single center , randomize phase II study . All patient irrespective registration trial receive radiotherapy accord standard treatment regimen Department Oncology , Aarhus University Hospital . Participation imply baseline follow-up procedure . In treatment planning phase patient randomize one follow arm : Arm 1 SPECT/CT-based treatment plan functional dose-volume parameter Arrm 2 Standard CT-based plan conventional dose-volume parameter . The trial consist two part . To initiate trial pilot study ( part 1 ) perform determine feasibility set Aarhus University Hospital describe literature . Consecutive patient enrol pilot study 1-year period . The interim analysis one year enrollment perform determine patient likely benefit functional radiotherapy planning base SPECT . The main objective part determine whether V/Q-SPECT data valid usable radiotherapy planning . The timing acute late follow-up SPECT determine . Randomized trial ( part 2 ) perform thereafter . Statistical analysis . The randomization permit block method use allocate patient treatment arm . Stratification factor age , gender , disease stage , histology , concurrent chemotherapy irradiate volume . The chi-squire test ( Î±=0.10 ) continuity correction use analysis primary analysis . For comparison , two-sided analysis perform p-value 0.05 less consider statistically significant . 95 % confidence interval construct outcomes interest . Descriptive statistic use summarize patient characteristic outcome intervention arm . Differences outcomes intervention arm compare use paired t-tests , Wilcoxon rank sum test McNemar test appropriate . Adjusting stratification factor perform use logistic regression linear regression . Time-to-event analysis estimate use Kaplan-Meier method , compare use Cox proportional hazard regression . Estimation relationship dose-volume parameter toxicity evaluate use logistic regression analysis . Within patient plan use SPECT , association dose-volume parameter calculate use SPECT calculate CT-plan evaluate use correlation coefficient . All patient randomize included analysis safety efficacy outcome . Secondary analysis may perform patient receive radiotherapy per treatment plan base SPECT CT per intervention arm . Any patient randomize receive radiotherapy base intervention allocate treatment plan describe detail along reason receive prescribed plan .</detailed_description>
