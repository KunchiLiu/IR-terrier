	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable disease characterize accumulation clonal plasma cell bone marrow [ 1 ] . The median overall survival patient myeloma approximately 4-5 year , MM remain incurable disease . Despite front line treatment approach , disease eventually relapse . While patient relapsed disease may achieve response subsequent antimyeloma therapy , duration response decrease successive relapse resistant disease develop . Until recently , median survival follow relapse induction therapy approximately one year . The recent US Food Drug Administration approval bortezomib ( 2003 ) combination lenalidomide plus dexamethasone ( 2006 ) therapy treatment previously treat MM provide effective therapeutic option give patient relapse refractory MM prospect prolongation overall progression-free survival time [ 2-4 ] . Although introduction novel agent autologous transplant procedure patient less 65 year old Melphalan Prednisone regimen elderly patient significantly improve response rate survival time , MM heterogeneous disease divergent outcomes driven biologic characteristic , especially cytogenetic characteristic [ 5 , 6 ] . Various study demonstrate cytogenetic characteristic detect fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) one powerful prognostic marker MM , especially presence deletion 17p13 ( del17p ) [ 6 , 7 ] translocation ( 4 ; 14 ) [ 6 , 7 ] represent approximately 20 % 25 % patient series [ 8 ] . The del ( 17p ) ( 4 ; 14 ) chromosomal abnormality associate poor progression-free survival shorter overall survival newly diagnose MM patient treat traditional chemotherapy … The conclusion recent study clear unmet medical need still exist additional novel therapeutic option treatment MM del17p ( 4 ; 14 ) novel agent propose earlier patient evolution . Pomalidomide belong immunomodulators compound thalidomide parent compound lenalidomide recently approve agent [ 14 ] . It derive thalidomide share number beneficial pharmacologic property thalidomide . The efficacy thalidomide limited adverse effect , include sedation , neuropathy , constipation , deep vein thrombosis . This toxicity profile seem dose duration-related , potential improve potency reduce toxicity . By modify thalidomide structure addition amino group 4 position phthaloyl ring , pomalidomide generate . … A phase 2 randomise open label study 2 modality Pomalidomide plus low-dose Dexamethasone patient Multiple Myeloma , refractory lenalidomide bortezomib conduct . This study address patient MM symptomatic progressive follow least two cycle lenalidomide two cycle bortezomib ( either separately combination ) . This study provide evidence pomalidomide no-cross resistance lenalidomide suggest provide benefit patient relapse novel therapy . This data demonstrate pomalidomide significant efficacy MM safely administer myeloma patient . STUDY RATIONALE . There increase number patient adverse karyotypic abnormality , del17p ( 4 ; 14 ) , require new therapeutic option improve progression free survival ultimately overall survival . Based recent study , hypothesize patient might benefit combination pomalidomide dexamethasone . We therefore design Multicenter Open label Phase II study Pomalidomide Dexamethasone Progressive Relapsed refractory Multiple Myeloma patient deletion 17p translocation ( 4 ; 14 ) Adverse Karyotypic Abnormalities . This study determine efficacy toxicity profile pomalidomide dexamethasone patient adverse prognostic factor determine use adverse karyotypic abnormality desperate need novel therapeutic . This study conduct accordance `` good clinical practice '' applicable regulatory requirement , include , applicable , 2008 version Declaration Helsinki . STUDY INDICATION In relapsed refractory MM patient , progressive , MM characterize Deletion 17p translocation ( 4 ; 14 ) Adverse Karyotypic Abnormalities STUDY DESIGN Overall design . This study Multicenter , Open-label , Single arm , Phase 2 study pomalidomide dexamethasone relapse refractory MM patient deletion 17p translocation ( 4 ; 14 ) . Eligible patient must progressive , relapsed refractory MM , deletion 17p and/or translocation ( 4 ; 14 ) use FISH technique measurable disease . There escalation dose study , Maximum Tolerated Dose already determine previous phase 1-2 escalation dose study 4 mg/day day 1 21 28 day cycle . The propose dose dexamethasone consider standard . Patients receive pomalidomide dexamethasone regimen progression . This study eventually improve time disease progression response rate , additional toxicity , compare available regimen , subgroup patient myeloma characterized adverse prognosis . Regimen Pomalidomide 4mg/day , oral route , day 1 21 per 28 day cycle Dexamethasone 40mg weekly , oral route , day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 per 28 day cycle patient age less 75 year , 20 mg weekly oral route per 28 day cycle patient age 75 year . Until progression either relapse refractory . Potentially eligible patient informed right achieve study sign inform consent prior undergoing study-related procedure . Patients undergo screen assessment protocol eligibility within 28 day randomization . For patient enroll study , study visit serial measurement safety efficacy perform monthly basis first 12 month 2-months basis thereafter . Tumor response , include progressive Disease , assess accord IMWG criterion . The severity Adverse Events grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 3.0 . In study , central laboratory analyze serum urine protein electrophoresis test ( myeloma [ M ] -protein level ) , serum urine immunofixation study ( CHRU Lille ) . FISH cytogenetic perform Nantes patient study . Efficacy assessments occur monthly basis ( 28 day , designate Study Day ) first 12 month 2-months basis thereafter , regardless current cycle day , perform within 3 day day one cycle . Study vital sign performance status request Study Day . Study Day 1 Open-Label Treatment occur day patient start pomalidomide-dexamethasone regimen . This regimen give oral route 2 therapeutic agent test . complete blood ( cell ) count monitor least every 7 day ( weekly ) first cycle . It also monitor first day cycle thereafter . Recommended concomitant therapy . All medication ( prescription non-prescription ) , treatment therapy take 28 day prior initiation study last dose study drug , must record case report form . Any treatment therapy use treat Serious Adverse Event occur within 28 day discontinuation study drug must also document . In addition , patient give prophylactic anti-thrombotic treatment , either aspirin daily ( commercial supply ) patient prior history thrombosis event low molecular weight heparin accord hospital guideline physician preference . All prophylactic antithrombotic treatment unless contraindicate accord hospital guideline physician preference must record . All patient monitor sign symptom venous thromboembolism Pomalidomide . The use hematopoietic growth factor permit study . The use bisphosphonates permit throughout study discretion Investigator . Other therapy consider necessary patient 's well may administer discretion Investigator . These therapy may include antibiotic , analgesic , antihistamine , medication transfusion red blood cell , platelet , fresh frozen plasma give assist management complication associate multiple myeloma therapy . Prohibited concomitant therapy Concomitant use sargramostim , anti-cancer therapy , include thalidomide , investigational agent permit subject receive study drug study . The need radiation therapy consider treatment failure . However , exception ( patient allow remain treatment phase study ) make radiation therapy pathological fracture site enhance bone heal treat post-fracture pain refractory narcotic analgesic pathologic bone fracture fulfill criterion disease progression End study treatment . Patients may continue study treatment Progression develop ( last study drug intake pomalidomide-dexamethasone regimen ) time complete Treatment Discontinuation visit outline Table 2 . Follow-Up .
