	<brief_summary>The incidence acute pancreatitis UK rise sharply past 40 year . Recent report suggest 56.5 per 100 000 population suffer AP annually ; figure double high previous estimate incidence . In majority patient condition mild , 25 % patient suffer severe attack 30 50 % patient die . The usual cause death multiple organ failure secondary systemic leukocyte activation ( mainly neutrophils ) , accompany systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . Studies omega-3 fish oil show control inflammatory process improve outcome especially hyperinflammatory condition . This research look effect supplement omega-3 fish oil patient severe acute pancreatitis ( severe inflammation pancreas ) . Patients severe acute pancreatitis prospectively blindly randomise either study group receive ( Lipidem , lipid emulsion contain essential fatty acid omega-3 fish oil ) control group receive ( Lipofundin , lipid emulsion contain essential fatty acid omega-3 fish oil ) . Normal standard clinical care provide patient per national management guideline . Each patient receive either Lipidem Lipofundin emulsion daily deem fit discharge medical team maximum SEVEN day . The main aim study examine whether lipid emulsion enrich omega-3 fish oil could improve clinical outcome patient severe acute pancreatitis .</brief_summary>
