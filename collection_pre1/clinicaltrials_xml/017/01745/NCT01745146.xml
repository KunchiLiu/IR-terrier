	<detailed_description>Problematic anger/ irritability common , persistent , difficult treat TBI , broad impact community social function . Anger follow TBI relate , part , deficit executive function include impaired problem-solving impaired self-monitoring . In 2-group , 3-center clinical trial mask outcome assessment , explore feasibility efficacy manualized , 8-session individual treatment , Anger Self-Management Training ( ASMT ) , compare treatment use non-specific ingredient therapist attention , education , psychological support ( PRE ) . The ASMT design decrease subjective objective anger irritability follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , use theoretically motivate `` active ingredient . '' The ASMT focus 2 executive deficit implicate anger post TBI , ( 1 ) self-awareness self-monitoring ( 2 ) problem-solving . Participants randomly assign 2:1 proportion ASMT PRE . The PRE treatment manualized degree ASMT , focus educational personal readjustment injury rather anger-specific strategy training . The overall goal examine effect ASMT compare PRE problematic anger , self-reported report significant others ( SOs ) , 1 week 2 month treatment ; assess time course treatment response treatment phase ; examine effect ASMT compare PRE range outcome ; assess association case mix variable , include participant characteristic injury variable , treatment response . Specific Aims 1 . To examine efficacy ASMT compare control treatment ( PRE ) measure improvement baseline post-treatment State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-Revised ( STAXI-2 ) Trait Anger ; STAXI-2 Anger Expression-Out ; Brief Anger-Aggression Questionnaire ( BAAQ ) ( primary outcome ) . 2 . To examine trajectory treatment response within treatment phase ASMT/ PRE show change 1 target scale halfway treatment ( i.e. , 4 8 session ) participant exhibit positive response post treatment ( define ) . 3 . To examine persistence treatment effect 2 month end treatment phase . 4 . To examine effect ASMT compare PRE anger symptom observe significant others ( relative close friend ) 1 week 2 month treatment . 5 . To examine impact ASMT versus PRE reduction emotional distress ( measure Brief Symptom Inventory ) broad outcomes emotional/behavioral function , global outcome , satisfaction life view between-group difference self- other-ratings frontal/ executive function , measure life satisfaction measure societal participation . 6 . To examine relationship ASMT PRE response rate participant characteristic , include : gender racial/ ethnic status ; severity chronicity TBI ; baseline intellectual , memory , executive function ; severity pre-treatment anger ; presence/ severity PTSD ; degree emotional blunting ( alexithymia ) ; involvement/ absence SO ; discrepancy self- SO report participant anger . Relationship treatment site treatment response also examine .</detailed_description>
