	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : 1 . Fibromyalgia ( FM ) : *Fibromyalgia second common rheumatologic disorder , behind osteoarthritis , afflict 2-4 % population industrialized country . ( Jacobsen Bredkjaer , 1992 ; Wolfe et al. , 1990 ) To fulfill criteria FM establish American College Rheumatology 1990 , individual must chronic widespread pain involve four quadrant body ( axial skeleton ) , presence 11 18 pre-defined `` tender point '' examination . A positive tender point identify individual complains pain approximately four kilogram pressure apply one point examiner . FM prototypical `` central '' `` non-nociceptive '' pain syndrome . Research perform within past decade clarify number important issue regard condition . Multiple study suggest neurological dysfunction hallmark disease ( Clauw Crofford , 2003 ) , support number objective functional neuroimaging abnormality . ( Gracely et al. , 2002 ; Harris et al. , 2007 ; Mountz et al. , 1995 ) Overall data suggest primary abnormality FM generalize disturbance central nervous system pain processing , leading individual sense pain throughout body absence inflammatory patho-anatomic damage . ( Clauw Chrousos , 1997 ; Yunus , 1992 ) Most FM neuroimaging study date examine brain response painful stimulus , image endogenous chronic pain notoriously difficult . ( Baliki et al. , 2007 ) . However study examine modulation specific brain region impact neurotransmitter level , network connectivity , structural change cortical thickness within subject . 2 . Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) : - Therapies directly modulate brain activity specific neural network might particularly suit relieve chronic pain individual FM . Ultimately , underlies interest neurostimulation approach , explore multiple level neuroaxis , include peripheral nerve , spinal cord , deep brain structure , cortex . ( Lefaucheur , 2004 ) Among method central neurostimulation , two , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , particularly appeal change brain activity non-invasive , painless safe way . TMS method brain stimulation develop 1985 ( Barker et al. , 1985 ) . It base time-varying magnetic field generates electric current inside skull focus restrict small brain area appropriate stimulation coil geometry size . ( Pascual-Leone et al. , 1999 ) . This current , apply repetitively , repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) , induce cortical modulation last beyond time stimulation . ( Pascual-Leone et al. , 1999 ) Although tDCS different mechanism action , induces similar modulatory effect . Several animal study 1960s show technique change brain activity reliably ( Nitsche et al. , 2003a , 2003b ) . tDCS base application weak direct current scalp flow two relatively large electrodesâ€”anode cathode . Some study show efficacy tDCS depend critically parameter electrode position current strength . ( Nitsche et al. , 2003a , 2003b ) In fact , application tDCS 13 min motor cortex modulate cortical excitability several hour . ( Nitsche Paulus , 2000 ; Nitsche Paulus , 2001 ) In addition , technique use obtain clinical gain neuropsychiatric disorder stroke epilepsy . ( Fregni Pascual-Leone , 2007 ) In study investigate modulatory effect 5 daily tDCS session biochemical , functional , structural system association clinical output FM . 3 . Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( H-MRS ) FM : *H-MRS neuroimaging obtains chemical spectra multiple volume-image element , voxels , within human brain use radiofrequencies excite proton . ( Ross Sachdev , 2004 ) Specific molecules identify characteristic resonance frequency spectrum . Once acquire , spectra analyze determine relative concentration different molecule central nervous system metabolite within voxel region interest . Typical metabolite identify : glutamate ( Glu ) , N-acetyl-aspartate ( NAA ) , creatine ( Cr ) , choline ( Cho ) , lactate , lipid , myoinositol , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutamine ( Gln ) . Glu GABA particular importance brain neurophysiology component excitatory inhibitory neurotransmission , respectively . Glu bind ionotropic metabotropic receptor locate postsynaptic neuron cause excitability ( i.e . depolarization ) . Moreover change strength Glu neurotransmission typically indicative synaptic plasticity , process propose involve chronic pain . ( Zhuo , 2008 ) H-MRS method display multiple feature amenable longitudinal study . High-resolution anatomical scan use isolate identical brain region successive session even week apart . Measurement metabolites within central nervous system largely understudied field pain . Grachev et al . report level NAA , marker neuronal viability also function ( Nakano et al. , 1998 ; Sager et al. , 2001 ) , low within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex individual chronic low back pain compare healthy control . ( Grachev et al. , 2000 ) In addition , recent investigation begin implement H-MRS technology ass functional change concentration Glu response evoke pain stimulus . ( Mullins et al. , 2005 ) Mullins et al . observe Glu level increase much 10 % anterior cingulate response cold pain applied foot . Glu central nervous system may play role FM pathophysiology . A study Peres et al . find cerebrospinal fluid level Glu elevate FM patient possibly consequence glutamatergic neurotransmission . ( Peres et al. , 2004 ) Administration ketamine , glutamate channel blocker , find reduce experimental pain ( Graven-Nielsen et al. , 2000 ) clinical pain ( Cohen et al. , 2006 ) FM . Moreover group recently demonstrate long-term treatment FM patient acupuncture lead change Glu level within posterior insula change highly correlate change pain : great reduction Glu associate great reduction experimental clinical pain ( Harris et al. , 2008 ) . In addition , recently compare posterior insula Glu combine Glu + Gln ( Glx ) FM patient match control demonstrate patient elevate Glx ( Glu ) level . ( Harris et al. , 2009 ) . 4 . Resting state network ( RSNs ) FM : *Previous study find task-free state ( i.e . rest scan ) , multiple distribute brain area demonstrate temporal correlation fMRI signal `` functional connectivity '' low frequency range . ( Biswal et al. , 1995 ; Fransson , 2005 ) In one first study , Biswal et al . find significant correlation rest fMRI signal sensorimotor cortex opposite hemisphere . ( Biswal et al. , 1995 ) This rest state network ( RSN ) refer sensorimotor network , SMN . ( Beckmann et al. , 2005 ) FM pain somatic localization ( usually soft tissue ) , hence rest connectivity SMN may demonstrate increase connectivity pain processing region . Other RSNs also describe , include one anatomically consistent Default Mode Network ( DMN ) ( Greicius et al. , 2003 ) [ review see ( Buckner Vincent , 2007 ; Vincent et al. , 2007 ) ] . This network involve brain region putatively engage self-referential cognition `` deactivate '' ( active rest task state ) variety externally focus task condition . Typically , DMN ( Figure 1 ) include inferior parietal lobule ( IPL ) ( ~BA 40 , 39 ) , posterior cingulate cortex ( ~BA 40 , 39 ) , posterior cingulate cortex ( ~BA 30 , 23 , 31 ) precuneus ( ~BA 7 ) , area inferior , medial superior frontal gyrus ( ~BA 8 , 9 , 10 , 47 ) , hippocampal formation , lateral temporal cortex ( ~BA 21 ) ( Buckner Vincent , 2007 ) . Resting fluctuation DMN demonstrate decreased connectivity Alzheimer 's disease ( Greicius et al. , 2003 ) increase connectivity depression ( Greicius et al. , 2004 ) , compare healthy control . Interestingly , rest state connectivity DMN also show change response intervention task . ( Waites et al. , 2005 ) Waites et al . find increase connectivity middle frontal gyrus posterior cingulate ( component DMN ) rest fMRI data follow active ( cognitive ) task . While functional significance spontaneous fluctuation DMN remain controversial , Fox Raichle suggest rest connectivity DMN fundamental balance excitatory inhibitory input multiple brain network , thereby set `` gain '' future task-related response . ( Fox Raichle , 2007 ) Positive correlation fMRI signal refer putatively excitatory connection whereas negative correlation imply putative inhibitory connectivity . We propose application tDCS decrease connectivity pain matrix region may result change within gain set DMN brain processing within pain matrix . 5 . White ( WM ) Gray Matter ( GM ) Plasticity Fibromyalgia : - The cortical mantle highly specialize , folded structure compose thin layer GM . Abnormal variation thickness cortical mantle might reflect pathophysiological change intrinsic structure integrity cortical lamina . Recently , study show correlation chronic pain diseases back pain ( Apkarian et al. , 2004 ) , migraine ( DaSilva et al. , 2007b ; Granziera et al. , 2006 ) trigeminal neuropathic pain ( see preliminary data ) . The implication alteration diseases either degenerative process neuroplasticassociated mechanism . Apkarian colleague ( Apkarian et al. , 2004 ) find reduction gray matter DLPFC chronic back pain patient compare healthy control use volumetric base approach . More recently , GM volume reduction also find parahippocampus , cingulate cortex patient fibromyalgia compare healthy control . However , seem similar change observe GM fibromyalgia patient may relate comorbid affective disorder pain endurance ( Peres et al. , 2004 ; Wood et al. , 2009 ) . Using sensitive reliable neuroimaging tool trigeminal neuropathic pain patient group find cortical thickness change spatially co-localized functional allodynic ( brush induce pain ) activation . In addition , pattern concurrent structural functional change chronic pain patient influence somatotopic localization ( sensorimotor cortex ) , know functionality specific region ( sensory-discriminative affective-motivational ) , underline activation/deactivation follow allodynic stimulation duration disorder ( see preliminary data ) . In another study migraine patient , find increased cortical thickness caudal sensorimotor cortex migraineurs compare control ( DaSilva et al. , 2007a ) . In cortical mantle , thickness change sensory cortex could due chronic sensory stimulation provoke chronic pain . This line recent study show cortical thickening sustain stimulation motor system ( Draganski et al. , 2004 ) . In study , volunteer learn juggle show transient selective thickening motor cortex , well motion-visual area ( MT/V5 ) , compare pre-learned phase . This suggest overstimulation sensory-discriminative affective-motivational neuronal system chronic pain may induce structural alteration cortex co-localized inefficient pain modulation opioidergic system molecular level . 6 . Evaluation Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls ( DNIC ) : - There body evidence suggest spontaneous pain hyperalgesia associate CMI due dysregulation intrinsic analgesic system . The well know intrinsic analgesic system endogenous opioid system , appear function normally CMI . Another system , term DNIC ( Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls ) , characterize widespread analgesia evoke noxious stimulus apply anywhere body , tourniquet ischemia , immersion painfully hot cold water . The widespread nature DNIC effect , involve convergent second order neuron spinal-brain loop , consistent diffuse widespread pain CMI disorder FM . The result several study suggest DNIC may alter CMI . Lautenbacher Rollman observe DNIC evoke hot water immersion decrease sensitivity painful electrical stimulus healthy control subject effect patient FM . Marchand [ unpublished observation ] report similar effect use immersion arm painfully hot water condition pain stimulus . This method show effect DNIC pain rating healthy control effect FM . Kosek Hansson find DNIC manipulation tourniquet ischemia decrease sensitivity painful pressure control subject patient FM . - Together , result consistent hypothesis pain tenderness FM may due tonically inactive DNIC analgesic system . These result , however , specify causality could also represent mechanism DNIC tonically activate CMI response widespread ongoing pain disease . These alternative mechanism separate use conventional psychophysical test . Performing test fMRI scanner differentiate mechanisms one case DNIC system remain `` OFF '' patient population , case DNIC system constantly `` ON . '' fMRI analysis activity brainstem region ( e.g. , caudal medulla ) implicate intrinsic DNIC analgesia provide evidence tonic ON OFF activity region , addition specify neuroanatomical locus abnormal pain processing . The fMRI analysis provide crucial evidence whether FM result DNIC defect whether DNIC abnormality simply one sign disease . 2 . RATIONALE ( propose research , potential benefit patient and/or society ) : a.There much information FM disease treatment option available . This study seek gain well , wholesome understanding Fibromyalgia . People suffer disease experience constant , chronic pain ; ultimately result absence school , work , etc . If feasible treatment available Fibromyalgia sufferer , increase life satisfaction bio-power ( people able work perform task ) increase . 3 . SPECIFIC AIMS ( Research Objectives ) : a.The main goal Collaborative Proposal investigate biochemical , functional , structural neuroimaging change follow non-invasive brain stimulation patient chronic widespread pain : fibromyalgia ( FM ) . Additionally , aim : - Determine effect tDCS excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate ( Glu ) within insula ( posterior anterior ) thalamus individual FM . Glu level within insula thalamus reduce follow tDCS , reflect regulation excitatory neurotransmission pain region . - Investigate whether long-term therapy tDCS normalize gray matter thickness target cortical area associate pain perception modulation FM . Cortical thickness FM patient , return comparable age- sex-matched pain-free control participant level follow tDCS . These effect specifically detect pain modulatory region ( e.g . dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex ) FM patient . - Explore effect long-term tDCS intrinsic connectivity pain process modulatory region brain network ( e.g . default mode network , sensory motor network ) FM . Our preliminary data suggest FM patient display enhance connectivity various pain processing region default mode network , specific brain network active period inactivity . We propose tDCS decrease connectivity pain modulatory region network default mode network thus result reduction pain symptom . 4 .
