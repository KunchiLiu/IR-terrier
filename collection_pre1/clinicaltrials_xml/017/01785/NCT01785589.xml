	<brief_summary>The new cadmium-zinc-telluride ( CZT ) technology powerful tool cardiac nuclear medicine . The increased photon count sensitivity camera use explore novel protocol like dual isotope ( rapid stress Tl-201/rest Tc-99m protocol use high-speed SPECT MPI ) . The use dual isotope image interest image combine use thallium-201 technetium-99m agent permit optimal image resolution simultaneous assessment viability , exam duration approximately 20 minute . However , study compare stress thallium-201/rest technetium-99m sequential dual isotope high-speed myocardial perfusion image versus invasive coronary angiography . The investigator report first validation high-speed protocol dual isotope myocardial perfusion image use invasive coronary angiography standard reference .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The new cadmium-zinc-telluride ( CZT ) technology powerful tool cardiac nuclear medicine . Indeed , recent clinical validation study CZT technology document scan time reduction low radiation dose without degradation myocardial perfusion image comparison standard dual detector camera . The increased photon count sensitivity camera use explore novel protocol may offer advantage standard protocol use Myocardial Perfusion Imaging . Berman et al . show rapid stress Tl-201/rest Tc-99m protocol use high-speed SPECT MPI offer superior quality Tl-201 stress image Tc-99m agent rest image preserve . Nuclear medicine present level scientific validation diagnosis prognosis coronary artery disease . A lot study compare performance standard dual detector camera vs. Invasive Coronary Angiography . Fiechter et al . report first validation ultrafast dedicated cardiac gamma camera CZT versus invasive coronary angiography . But use novel hybrid SPECT /CT device 99m-Tc-tetrofosmin pharmacological stress/rest examination . However , study compare stress thallium-201/rest technetium-99m sequential dual isotope high-speed myocardial perfusion image versus invasive coronary angiography . Moreover , diagnosis performance high-speed protocol versus fractional flow reserve stenosis evaluation unknown . The investigator report first validation high-speed protocol dual isotope myocardial perfusion image use invasive procedure ( coronary angiography fractional flow reserve ) standard reference .</detailed_description>
