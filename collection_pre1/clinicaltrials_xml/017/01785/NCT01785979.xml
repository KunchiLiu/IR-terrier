	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial address complication relate recurrent episode malaria endemic area - hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly . We aim assess efficacy chloroquine prednisone-induction therapy compare standard treatment chloroquine alone treatment adult patient newly diagnose hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prednisone Plus Chloroquine Treatment Hyper-reactive Malarial Splenomegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyper-reactive malarious splenomegaly ( HMS ) know chronic autoimmune complication area malaria endemic . Patients HMS complain commonly abdominal swell pain enlarge spleen condition define use clear clinical laboratory criterion . HMS appear benign patient see first untreated , lead severe anaemia also acute bacterial infection . There familiar ethnic cluster suggest genetic basis . High prevalence rate report certain area Papua New Guinea , Venezuela , HMS also common part sub-Saharan Africa , include Sudan Ghana . The treatment HMS still empirical since randomize trial do far . Long term anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis deem mainstay therapy , optimal drug-regimen duration unknown . Three six month may pass response observe , relapse may occur therapy discontinue . On basis observe benefit experimental study , glucocorticoid use severe hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly various case report . Because case favourable outcome drug tolerability good , prednisone become attractive therapeutic option disease . Central pathophysiology HMS overproduction Immunoglobulin M due functional CD8 T-cell defect consequent expansion activation B lymphocytes . Glucocorticoids may immediate effect due inhibition sequestration immunoglobulin coat red blood cell mononuclear phagocyte system later effect due glucocorticoid-induced inhibition antibody synthesis . We aim assess efficacy chloroquine prednisone-induction therapy compare chloroquine alone treatment adult patient newly diagnose hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly .</detailed_description>
