	<brief_summary>Total shoulder surgery associate considerable postoperative pain may prevent rehabilitation early discharge hospital . Continuous interscalene block home infusion commonly perform pain relief follow total shoulder arthroplasty .

	<brief_title>Continuous Interscalene Block Same Day Discharge Following Total Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number shoulder replacement surgery increase year expect continue population age ( 1 ) . This necessitate adequate pain control immediate early postoperative period pain level typically high . Adequate analgesia ensure patient comfort ability perform physical therapy exercise associate positive surgical outcome ( 2-3 ) . Interscalene brachial plexus block ( ISB ) commonly perform provide analgesia patient undergoing surgical procedure shoulder region . Either single injection block continuous perineural infusion perform along oral medication well pain control patient . Compared intravenous opioids , ISB know produce superior analgesia major shoulder surgery ( 4,5 ) . There report outpatient TSA discharge directly recovery room follow use continuous ISB achievement adequate range motion test ( 6 ) . Consequently , ambulatory ISB may offer decreased hospitalization ensure adequate analgesia TSA . Ilfeld et al ( 7 ) prospectively compare ISB opioids regard time readiness discharge follow TSA , follow many study demonstrate safety efficacy continuous ISB TSA ( 8 , 9 ) . Ilfeld et al ( 6 ) show discharge criterion 21 ( 16-41 ) h use ISB compare 51 ( 37-90 ) h receive perineural normal saline . In centre , healthy patient require shoulder arthroplasty usually remain in-patients management pain . Perineural infusion may continue home use portable infusion pump discharge . With use disposable portable infusion pump continuous ISB , may feasible discharge patient reduce hospitalization time . Although study Ilfeld et al show continuous ISB allow earlier home discharge follow TSA , patient study evaluated readiness discharge POD1 10 AM rather early time possible . Another interesting finding patient receive ropivacaine infusion till 6 AM POD1 author also claim discharged patient afternoon surgery . The block infusion report previous study higher use institute . There also conflict evidence although continuous ISB provide adequate analgesia , seldom impact early functional rehabilitation ( 10 ) . With background want evaluate early time achievement readiness discharge use ISB follow TSA .</detailed_description>
