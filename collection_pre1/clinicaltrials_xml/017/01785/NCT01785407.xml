	<detailed_description>Background : Oral iron supplementation ( OIS ) widely-used strategy treat iron deficiency anemia . However , absorption OIS often low response variable . To overcome , large dos give may reduce compliance due gastric irritation . Thus , OIS dose low , maximize absorption . The prevail serum hepcidin concentration ( SHep ) major determinant iron absorption erythrocyte iron utilization . Based limited data human , SHep increase single OIS dose duration increase uncertain : may range 24 96 hr . Also , data increase SHep determine absorption dose oral iron . Is threshold SHep subsequent iron absorption sharply reduce ? Better understanding relationship would valuable design effective safer OIS regimens . Objectives : 1 ) Determine duration magnitude Fe induce Hepcidin rise form single iron dose determine bioavailability 2 ) Compare bioavailability single dose iron supplement consume one ( two dosage ) . Methods/Subjects : Healthy female subject screen low iron status . Anemic subject exclude study . Thirty two subject include serum ferritin &lt; 20 Âµg/L , C-reactive protein &lt; 5 mg/L Hemoglobin &gt; 117 g/L . Subjects randomize two group Hepcidin ( sHep ) iron status marker monitor day 1 ( baseline ) . Subjects receive iron supplement dosages 40 , 80 , 160 240 mg either single two consecutive dosage stable iron isotopes 54Fe , 57Fe , 58Fe form 4 mg iron sulfate ( FeSO4 ) . Prior administration blood sample collect 8:00 , 12:00 16:00 monitor sHep iron status marker , measurement repeat day supplement administration . On follow day , sHep measure 8:00 quantify duration iron induce hepcidin rise . In second week , subject receive single Fe dose week 1 receive two consecutive dosage vice versa , sample scheme week one apply . On day 23 , last blood sample collect iron incorporation stable isotopic label measure different dosage administer . Outcome : The combine use stable iron isotope sensitive SHep assay allow good understand iron-hepcidin relationship may enable design effective OIS regimen .</detailed_description>
