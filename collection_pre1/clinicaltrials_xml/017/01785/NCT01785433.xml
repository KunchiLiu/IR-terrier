Capable understanding requirement , risk , benefit study participation , , judge investigator , capable give informed consent compliant study requirement 1 . Pregnancy , nursing , plan become pregnant donate gamete ( ova sperm ) vitro fertilization study period 30 day follow subject 's last study relate visit ( eligible subject , applicable ) . 2 . History current evidence ( determined medical history , physical examination , clinical laboratory assessment ECG ) clinically significant uncontrolled disease include , limited : cardiovascular ( e.g. , uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure , know aortic aneurysm , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia coronary heart disease ) , hepatic , renal , haematological , neuropsychological , endocrine ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled thyroid disorder , Addison 's disease , Cushing 's syndrome ) , gastrointestinal ( e.g. , poorly control peptic ulcer , gastroesophageal reflux disease ) pulmonary ( COPD asthma , sarcoidosis , noncystic fibrosis ( CF ) bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia diagnosis alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency ) .

Occurrence COPD exacerbation resolve 14 day prior randomization . Note : An exacerbation COPD define worsen subject 's baseline COPD symptoms require treatment rescue albuterol/salbutamol/ipratropium subject 's regular maintenance treatment . This include require use systemic corticosteroid and/or emergency room visit hospitalization , change subject 's regular , addition medication use treat COPD symptom . 15 . Subjects require oxygen therapy investigator 's opinion , unable abstain use oxygen therapy test 16 . Subjects start stop exercise rehabilitation program within 4 week Screening Visit ( SV ) 17 . Known suspected hypersensitivity idiosyncratic reaction tiotropium , ingredient use study medication formulation 18 . Severe allergy milk protein 19 . Significant adverse drug reaction , include allergy hypersensitivity reaction , atropine anticholinergic substance relate pharmacologically atropine ( e.g. , ipratropium oxitropium ) 20 . Use prohibit concomitant medication within prescribe ( per protocol ) withdrawal period prior Screening Visit 21 . Treatment orally administer ( exclude orally inhale ) βadrenergics ( i.e. , oral salbutamol ) 22 . Treatment βadrenergic receptor antagonist ( e.g . nonselective βreceptor block agent like βblocking antihypertensive product ) administer route . The single exception cardioselective β1adrenergic receptor antagonist ( e.g . atenolol , metoprolol , bisoprolol ) permit provided subject stable dose least 1 week prior screen visit subject expect able maintain dose throughout study . 23 .
