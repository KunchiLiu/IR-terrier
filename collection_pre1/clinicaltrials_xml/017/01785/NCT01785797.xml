	<brief_summary>This prospective randomised-controlled multi-centre trial base Hong Kong determine whether temporary subdural drain placement burr hole evacuation chronic subdural haematoma reduce risk recurrence . Consecutive patient , 60 year old , diagnose symptomatic chronic subdural haematoma indicate burr hole operative drainage randomly allocate one two group : ( 1 ) intra-operative subdural drain placement ( intervention group ) ( 2 ) drain placement ( control group ) . Using web-based software block randomisation allocation ratio 1:1 conduct . Instructions use use drain contain sealed envelope label sequential study number . Intra-operatively , surgeon-in-charge judge burr hole evacuation haematoma patient 's condition unsafe drain placement , subject exclude study . Otherwise , randomisation perform juncture opening seal envelop . The procedure involve place prefabricate silicon drain subdural space accord standard protocol remove second post-operative day bedside . Subjects operate surgeon judge drain placement unsafe exclude study . Drainage undertaken passively hang collection bag bedside dependent position . In addition general demographic , clinical radiological presentation data , potential risk factor recurrence document . Serial compute tomography brain scan arrange ( discharge , four week six month ) occurence significant subdural haematoma recurrence require repeat operative drainage six month record . Other outcome measure determine regular time interval total follow-up period six month ( upon discharge , four week six month ) include : functional performance term extend Glasgow Outcome Scale modify Rankin Scale , add neurological deficit , death surgery-related complication . All outcomes document trial investigator responsible clinician . The data obtain analysed accord principle intention treat . Hypothesis : compare burr-hole evacuation chronic subdural haematoma alone ( control ) , additional placement subdural drain evacuation ( intervention ) reduce risk recurrence require repeat surgery .</brief_summary>
