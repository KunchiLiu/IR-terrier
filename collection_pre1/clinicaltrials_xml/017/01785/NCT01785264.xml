	<brief_summary>To compare end-results three different method treatment acute achilles tendon rupture , necessary establish identical rehabilitation protocol . Traditionally , early mobilization reserve patient treat surgically may unintentionally skew treatment result . The investigator therefore design prospective randomize trial perform collaboration Akershus University Hospital ( Ahus ) , Oslo University Hospital ( The Emergency Department ) , Østfold Hospital ( Fredrikstad ) Drammen Hospital . The four institution choose geographical proximity jointly substantial catchment area . Treatment divide three arm , patient 18 60 year age sustain first time achilles tendon rupture invite participate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Results After Acute Rupture Achilles Tendon .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize either surgery non-operative treatment . Surgery perform open technique use mini-invasive approach . Open surgery remain widespread arguably best documented treatment , however mini-invasive surgery also include potential lessen risk wound complication . Michael Amlang Hans Zwipp University Dresden represent lead foot- ankle surgeon Europe . They co-worker develop protocol mini-invasive surgery use specially adapt proprietary instrument . Michael Amlang visit Ahus 2012 teach general principle Dresden mini-invasive treatment . To ensure optimal reproducible result , surgeon participate study must master technique . All patient include study immobilize equinus position first two week use below-the-knee cast . Following first two week cast replaced brace maintain ∼12° plantar flexion ( three heel lift ) . We choose use standardize heel lift ease weightbearing compare hinged brace . After two week ( four week injury ) ankle position adjust ∼8° plantar flexion ( two heel lift ) follow additional two week ankle position adjust ∼4° plantar flexion ( one heel lift ) . The last week orthosis treatment heel lift completely remove . Hence , brace retain total six week , patient allow full weight bearing tolerate entire time period . The brace worn day night first two week , remove nighttime last four week . Importantly , immobilization regimen identical three-treatment group . To ensure identical rehabilitation follow immobilization , physical therapy adhere standardize protocol supervise experienced physiotherapist Norwegian Sport Medicine Clinic ( NIMI ) . The defined endpoint treatment result evaluate Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score ( ATRS ) . This patient-centered self-reporting instrument good reliability , validity sensitivity . Furthermore , ATRS combine SF36 , another commonly use self-reporting instrument . Pain evaluate visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Functional result evaluate The MuscleLab measurement system ( Ergotest Innovation , Porsgrunn , Norway ) . The system consist two different jump test ( drop counter-movement jump hopping ) , two different strength test ( concentric heel rise eccentric-concentric heel rise ) one muscular endurance test ( stand heel rise ) system show valid reliable assess low leg function patient Achilles tendinopathy . We also measure dorsiflexion plantarflexion range movement ( ROM ) well circumference calf , widely use endpoint similar study . Secondly , want compare risk complication infection reruptures . The patient examine baseline 6 12 month . Since minor functional improvement 12 month , plan later follow-up part main project . The 6 12 month examination complete Norwegian Sport Medicine Clinic ( NIMI ) , examination blind perform two physiotherapist take part study prior final follow-up . Patients wear knee sock hide potential scar tissue . Although minimum clinically important difference ATRS score yet determine , Carmont coworkers show 7 point represent small detectable change . Moreover , study Metz et al . find patient reruptures achilles tendon present average 18 point low score whereas patient injury sural nerve superficial wound infection present score 10 9 point low average , respectively . In order detect difference 7 point ATRS score 80 % power must 160 patient group . Power calculation base one-way ANOVA analyse assume common standard deviation 20 . This concomitantly allow u detect difference low 8 % respect complication . This pivotal importance since assess risk reruptures essential establish treatment recommendation . We therefore plan include total 530 patient allow expected loss follow-up . Ahus , The Emergency Department Oslo University Hospital , Drammen Fredrikstad Hospitals catchment area nearly 1.3 million people treat excess 300 achilles tendon rupture annually . This allow completion inclusion period within three year . In view , first study include sufficient number patient detect less , yet important difference , result publish suitable international peer-reviewed journal . The prospective randomize trial embodies many different discipline spur follow-up study . As part main project conduct treatment-cost analysis relation individual result . We also perform investigation base ultrasound grade Achilles tendon rupture accord classification system establish Michael Amlang colleague . Previous study provide evidence suggest treatment result may depend extension injury , treatment recommendation base type rupture sustain . This particular interest may facilitate individualized treatment . Together prospective randomize trial treatment-cost analysis , ultrasound investigation constitute core Doctor Philosophy ( PhD ) project .</detailed_description>
