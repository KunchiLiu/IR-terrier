	<brief_summary>The CUSA ( cavitron ultrasound surgical aspirator ) method choice hepatic resection center . Recently stapler-hepatectomy method develop approve liver surgery use Covidien Endo-Gia stapler . The potential benefit method potential short transection time compare CUSA technique . Thus investigator perform randomize controlled trial include 20 patient stapler-group 20 patient CUSA control group . Primary endpoint transection speed . Secondary endpoint peri-operative ( d-1 , d0 , d1 , d3 ) cytokines concentration , T cell subset , blood loss , morbidity , cost analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence Two Different Hepatectomy Methods Transection Speed Chemokine Release From Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many different technique parenchymal transection use hepatic surgery . In systematic review , significant difference morbidity ( include bile leak ) , mortality , routine marker liver parenchymal injury dysfunction length hospital stay irrespective method use parenchymal transection . This Cochrane review analyze study compare follow transection device : CUSA ( cavitron ultrasound surgical aspirator ) versus clamp-crush ( two trial ) ; radiofrequency dissect sealer versus clamp-crush ( two trial ) ; sharp dissection versus clamp-crush technique ( one trial ) ; hydrojet versus CUSA ( one trial ) . The clamp-crush technique appear low blood loss low transfusion requirement compare technique . However , even specialize center morbidity mortality rate hepatic resection still range 45 % 3 % respectively uncertainty persist regard optimal technique transection . Local experience seem important factor choice transection method . An innovative technique stapler hepatectomy use Covidien Endo-Gia™ Ultra Handle Short Staplers Endo Gia™ TRI staple 60mm 45 mm AVM/AMT load unit ( Covidien ) . A randomized control trial ( CRUNSH trial ) evaluate intraoperative blood loss stapler hepatectomy compare clamp-crushing technique currently way . The CUSA technique well establish many center include excellent morbidity mortality rate . However , show CUSA long transection speed clamp-crush technique ( vascular occlusion ) . The investigator CRUNSH trial hypothesize stapler hepatectomy technique might also comparable favorable clamp-crushing regard transection time advantage avoid vascular occlusion . Therefore stapler hepatectomy also faster CUSA . It show release cytokine , chemokines , stress hormone correlate postoperative infection organ dysfunction . Chemokines critically involve process leukocyte recruitment activation liver . Major surgery cause inflammation reflect production pro-inflammatory cytokine . In various study IL-6 , instance , valid predictor post-operative sepsis , complication mortality . Besides , level cytokine expect correlate degree surgical trauma . Therefore difference cytokine level two study group assess , include pro- ( INF-γ , IL-1β , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL12p70 , TNFα ) anti-inflammatory ( IL-4 , IL-10 , IL-13 ) cytokine . Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) production elevate Kupffer cell follow ischemia / reperfusion response free radical neutrophil elastase , well animal oxidative liver injury model ( e.g . carbon tetrachloride ) Macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha ( MIP3-alpha ) constitutively express liver . It strongly chemotactic cytokine-stimulated neutrophil , immature dendritic cell memory/effector T B lymphocytes utilizing chemokine receptor ( CCR ) 6. sCD163 ( soluble haemoglobin scavenger receptor ) novel marker activate macrophage , like neopterin determine serum plasma . The effect transection speed respect chemokine release never investigate . The investigator hypothesize short transection time lead reduced release molecule potentially result improve postoperative outcome . Additionally interaction adaptive innate immunity play significant role liver ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury . Notably , activation T cell absence TCR ligation seem predominant factor initial phase I/R injury . Therefore pilot study , peripheral T cell subset ( include naïve T cell , effector central memory T cell , regulatory T cell , early activate T cell ) determine flow cytometry subgroup study patient ( i.e . patient undergoing hepatic resection oncological reason ) . The supposedly slow technique CUSA resection shall therefore compare novel technique stapler hepatectomy .</detailed_description>
