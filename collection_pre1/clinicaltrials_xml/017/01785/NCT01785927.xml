	<brief_summary>The inhaled route delivery always associate considerable challenge get drug target . The lung highly complex organ design filter inspire air , many different cell type contribute function . Furthermore , lung may change dramatically afflicted disease result internal environment work drug reach interact successfully target . For target upper airway less significance , drug delivery deep lung may impede change mucus hyper-secretion thicken airway narrow . In order interpret toxicology finding necessary reconcile test sensitivity , background biological variation , normal response inhaled material drug medicine-specific adverse effect . Identification adverse end-points area well control data set might help discern true adverse effect normal physiological lung response . The lung respond acutely inhalation irritant material hyper-secretion mucus , chemokine release , inflammatory cell recruitment cough collectively may characterize non-specific irritancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Four formulation antituberculosis drug ( rifampicin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide , levofloxacin ) administer patient randomization . Each formulation assign code , A , B , C , D , treatment sequence generate ABCD ( sequence 1 ) , BCDA ( sequence 2 ) , CDAB ( sequence 3 ) DABC ( sequence 4 ) . On first day drug dose period I , volunteer randomly assign sequence treatment indicate pre-printed randomization scheme , generate use block randomization block size 4 6 , allocation ratio 1:1 . Subjects stratify sex . Subjects sequence 1 receive treatment A first study period cross receive treatment B , C , D second , third fourth period , respectively ( 7-day washout period ) .</detailed_description>
