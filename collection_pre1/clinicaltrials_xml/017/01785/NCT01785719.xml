	<brief_title>Ultrasound Characterization Ovarian Morphology During Weight Loss Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) one common endocrine disorder occur woman reproductive age . PCOS consider syndrome ovarian dysfunction characterize heterogeneous clinical manifestation infrequent absent menstrual cycle , hyperandrogenism , polycystic ovarian morphology . Since majority patient also present obesity , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and/or risk factor metabolic syndrome , definite need development therapeutic strategy help woman lose weight improve metabolic reproductive function . At present , evidence suggest loss little 5-10 % body weight prescribed diet lifestyle intervention improve symptomology woman PCOS . However , mechanism whereby weight loss specifically stimulate ovulation restores menstrual cyclicity unclear . Hence , goal study explore effect weight loss ovarian morphology , metabolism , body composition overweight obese woman PCOS . The researcher believe dietary intervention base nutritional recommendation USDA Dietary Guidelines Americans , support Obesity Society American Diabetes Association , reduce degree metabolic disturbance consequently restore healthy ovarian follicle development woman PCOS . To accomplish objective , 30 overweight ( BMI 25-29.9 kg/m^2 ) obese ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2 ) woman PCOS evaluate every-other-day 3D transvaginal ultrasonography 4-week baseline interval 12-week commercial weight loss program ( Nutrisystem® D ) . Participants range age 18 - 38 used hormonal contraception , fertility therapy , insulin sensitizer three month prior enrollment . Ultrasound scans ovary assess total number size follicle use two- three-dimensional imaging technique . Participants blood sample collect every visit track change LH , FSH , estrogens , progesterone scan interval . The following metabolic parameter assess Week 2 baseline interval Weeks 6 12 commercial weight loss program : ( 1 ) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test characterize glucose insulin dynamic 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minute post-glucose ingestion ; ( 2 ) dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan quantify body fat lean muscle distribution ; ( 3 ) vitals anthropometry assessment measure waist hip circumference , height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , ( 4 ) fast blood test detect androgen ( i.e. , total testosterone , androstenedione , free androgen index ) serum marker metabolic syndrome ( i.e. , lipid hemoglobin A1C ) . Further , evaluate effect ovarian morphology , metabolism , body composition sustain weight loss and/or weight maintenance overweight obese woman PCOS , participant invite return six month intervention complete . The aforementioned procedure , include transvaginal ultrasound , 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test , DXA , vitals anthropometry assessment , fast test repeat .</detailed_description>
