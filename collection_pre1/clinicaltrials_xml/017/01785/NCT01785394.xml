	<detailed_description>Patients grass pollen allergy typical best respond sublingual immunotherapy . Their selection do accordance criterion list Chapter 9 World Allergy Organization Position Paper specific immunotherapy 2009 compliance rule good clinical practice . Proposed primary variable : difference change exhale breath temperature pollen season subject treat grass-pollen sublingual immunotherapy untreated control patient . Suggested secondary variable : change time exhale breath temperature two group , difference symptom score , methacholine responsiveness , rescue medication usage . Statistical analysis : On basis available data variability exhale breath change change upon flare airway inflammation anti-inflammatory treatment calculate sample size 20 subject group sufficient prove difference primary variable significance level &lt; 0.05 . However , `` first time ever '' type pilot study sublingual immunotherapy exhale breath temperature grass-pollen patient , estimate relative . By mean study identify trend use sample size calculation future study . During second year study patient active treatment 5 grass allergen extract , carry effect first year treatment 5 grass allergen extract placebo exhale breath temperature explore .</detailed_description>
