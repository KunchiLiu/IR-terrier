	<brief_summary>Thousands vein puncture do every day hospital worldwide . Vein puncture perform connection blood sampling , peripheral intravenous catheter ( PIV ) placement blood donation . The predominantly use venous blood withdraw cubital region area venous superficial place often visible human eye . However , use usual blind landmark palpation method region , often prove exceedingly difficult even impossible obtain peripheral venous access patient obese , chronically ill , hypovolemic intravenous drug user . Various study show success rate establish vascular access ultrasound compare blind landmark technique high patient difficult access . When ultrasound use establish intravascular access , prerequisite sterile puncture area challenge meet due ultrasound gel area fact ultrasound transducer wipe clean alcohol contact patient 's skin blood . A strict sterile procedure important reduce complication relate infection.The traditional way cop cover transducer wire long sterile sheet use sterile gel . The sheet must tight rubber band around transducer pull tightly around transducer foot prevent artefacts appear screen . This expensive time consume method , still leave problem gel puncture area . The investigator develop method problem solve use , slightly modify , commercial drape combination Dynamic Needle Tip Positioning technique The investigator hypothesize possible perform ultrasound-guided venous puncture sterile dry puncture area puncture perform proximal distal traditional puncture side . It procedure present study serf demonstrate feasibility method ten healthy volunteer . The study take place Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby .</brief_summary>
