	<brief_title>DECAMP-1 : Diagnosis Surveillance Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Detection Early lung Cancer Among Military Personnel ( DECAMP ) consortium multidisciplinary translational research program include 7 Veterans Administration Hospitals ( VAH ) , 4 designate Military Treatment Facilities ( MTF ) one academic hospital clinical study site , several molecular biomarker laboratory , along Biostatics , Bioinformatics , Pathology Biorepository core . The DECAMP Coordinating Center facilitate rapid selection , design execution clinical study within multi-institutional consortium . The goal accomplish recruit 500 smoker indeterminate pulmonary nodule ( 0.7cm - 3.0cm ) chest CT undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy follow 2 year final diagnosis make . The diagnostic performance four previously establish lung cancer biomarkers cohort validate ; 1 ) gene-expression biomarker measure bronchial airway brushing ; 2 ) proteomic signature measure bronchial airway biopsy ; 3 ) proteomic signature measure serum ; 4 ) signature serum cytokine . The added value molecular marker clinical image marker routinely use diagnostic work patient develop integrate model ( i.e . clinical , image &amp; molecular marker ) result robust diagnostic predictor evaluate .</detailed_description>
