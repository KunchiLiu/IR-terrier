	<brief_summary>This study multiple-arm , multiple-stage ( MAMS ) , phase 2 , open label , randomize , control clinical trial compare efficacy safety four experimental four drug regimens standard control regimen patient smear positive , pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) . Patients randomly allocate control one four experimental regimen ratio 2:1:1:1:1 . Experimental regimen give 12 week . Thereafter , participant experimental arm receive continuation phase treatment 14 week contain standard-dose rifampicin isoniazid . All participant receive 25 mg vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) every dose INH prevent INH‐related neuropathy . Interim analyse conduct trial efficacy , aim identify experimental arm perform pre‐specified efficacy threshold ; arm stop recruitment . Following first schedule interim analysis March 3rd , Trial Steering Committee ( TSC ) follow recommendation independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC ) stop enrolment two arm MAMS-TB trial : HRZQ HR20ZQ , base arm meet pre-specified gain efficacy control . Importantly , safety concern prompt stop recruitment arm . They recommend recruitment arm 2 ( HRZQ ) 3 ( HR20ZQ ) terminate insufficient evidence regimen could shorten treatment . Importantly , evidence either arm inferior standard treatment ( control arm ) regard efficacy . There , however , sufficient evidence intervention arm HR35ZE HR20ZM could shorten treatment continue enrol patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase II , multi‐arm , multi‐stage , open label , prospectively randomize , control clinical trial compare efficacy safety four experimental regimen control , standard treatment regimen patient smear positive , pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) . There four experimental regimen . Participants randomly allocate control one four experimental intensive phase regimen ratio 2:1:1:1:1 . The control 4 experimental regimen : Control : HRZE isoniazid , rifampicin standard , pyrazinamide , ethambutol Arm 1 : HRZQlow isoniazid , rifampicin standard , pyrazinamide , SQ109 150 mg Arm 2 : HRZQhigh isoniazid , rifampicin standard , pyrazinamide , SQ109 300 mg Arm 3 : HR20ZQhigh isoniazid , rifampicin 20 mg/kg , pyrazinamide , SQ109 300 mg Arm 4 : HR20ZM isoniazid , rifampicin 20 mg/kg , pyrazinamide , moxifloxacin 400mg Up 372 participant randomize study , 124 participant randomize control arm 62 participant experimental arm . With expect loss follow‐up 5 % , final power study detect hazard ratio 1.8 culture conversion negative 90 % , 5 % significance level . Participants randomise use probabilistic minimisation algorithm base site , baseline bacterial load measure GeneXpert MTB/RIF® , HIV status . The allocated intensive phase four experimental arm administer daily twelve week . During time , participant visit study clinic weekly basis sputum collection , safety monitoring receipt study medication . After completion experimental treatment , participant experimental arm receive daily standard continuation phase treatment 14 week contain standard‐dose RIF INH complete TB treatment course . Participants control arm receive eight week intensive four‐drug treatment ( HRZE , follow 18 week HR continuation phase treatment line current WHO recommendation . All participant receive 25mg Vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) every dose treatment order prevent INH‐related neuropathy . Interim analyse conduct trial efficacy predetermine time , aim identify experimental arm perform pre‐specified efficacy threshold . There recruitment arm .</detailed_description>
