	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Implement integrate protocol Sierra Leone management MAM non-complicated SAM use single anthropometric indicator well food . Standard care refers traditional , segregate treatment MAM SAM . Hypothesis : An integrated management protocol MAM SAM achieve great community coverage great individual recovery rate standard care . Methods Eligible subject child MAM non-complicated SAM age 6-59 month . MAM define MUAC &lt; 12.5 cm , ≥ 11.5 cm . Non-complicated SAM define MUAC &lt; 11.5 cm , + ++ bilateral edema , acceptable appetite . An acceptable appetite judge give child 30 g RUTF ask mother fee food child 20 minute . Children SAM able consume RUTF eligible study . Children unable consume RUTF present IMCI warning sign ( convulsion , alter mental status , respiratory distress ) consider complicate SAM refer inpatient treatment . Only young child malnutrition household enrol ; old sibling treat operationally use protocol . Exclusion criterion include child obvious chronic debilitate illness like cerebral palsy congenital abnormality , receive treatment MAM SAM previous two month . If child need immediate medical care s/he offer treatment transport near health center , enrol . Informed consent seek caretaker eligible child nurse familiar study fluent caretaker 's native language . Duration study participation requirement explain . Informed consent give verbally write . Study design This cluster randomize , unblinded , clinical control trial conduct child compare integrated treatment SAM MAM standard treatment . The primary outcome treatment coverage recovery rate . The obvious difference integrate standard care make subject staff blind impossible . Ten study sit rural peri-urban Sierra Leone , treatment SAM MAM currently offer , select Ministry Health Sanitation National Nutrition Program Sierra Leone PI study . Site manager consult cooperation solicit prior definitively select site . The minimum sample size 900 child MAM 900 SAM , 450 receiving integrate care 450 receive standard care group . Assuming recovery rate 75 % , sample size detect improvement recovery rate 80 % integrate protocol , 95 % specificity 82 % power . Participation Integrated Protocol Upon enrollment demographic information collect , weight , height MUAC measure , simple health history obtain , child assess edema . Information record standard data collection card . Enough RUTF dispense 2 week therapy , child ask return follow-up every 2 week . Children SAM initially give oral amoxicillin twice daily week ask return follow-up every 2 week . Once child SAM achieve MUAC &gt; 11.5 cm , RUTF dose reduce . Upon follow-up , caretaker child question symptom acute illness , compliance study food food intolerance allergy . If edema persists MUAC ≤ 12.5 cm , additional two week RUTF dispense . If child judge altered mental status , respiratory distress acute clinical illness need medical care , child refer health center complicate SAM withdrawn . If MUAC &gt; 12.5 cm , child give lipid-based nutrient supplement ( LNS ) , bed net , albendazole , zinc , referral immunization compliant current WHO recommendation , oral rehydration salt give child three loose watery stool 24 hour , ask return follow-up 1 , 3 6 month . Caretakers instruct seek medical care sooner child fever , poor appetite sign acute illness . If child 6-24 month age , caretaker participate enhance breastfeed counseling , carry Care Group model . A Care Group team 10 15 trained volunteer provide health nutrition education resident within 10 15 household , aim change behavior health practice . Each integrated program center implement one several Care Groups depend number 6-24 month old child enrol program . The Care Group model build upon multiplication volunteer effort , peer support community mobilization , thereby create social movement involve entire community foster positive behavior change . The key message appropriate complementary feeding continue breastfeed 6-24 month old child . Ancillary message include family planning , immediate exclusive breastfeeding infant 0-5 month , safe hygiene practice . All health community health worker involve project follow one week Care Group train support adequate complementary feed 6-24 month old . Participation Standard Protocol These child receive treatment accordance 'National protocol community-based management acute malnutrition ' Sierra Leone , reflect standard practice worldwide . The management scheme use weight-for-height z-score ( WHZ ) categorize child include separate care MAM non-complicated SAM , use different food . A research assistant assign standard care site collect informed consent , data , assess availability food supply . If food available , study supply , essential make valid comparison two protocol . Integrated Protocol Foods Children participate integrate treatment protocol receive , supplement normal diet , 75 kcal/kg/d RUTF MUAC ≥ 11.5 cm edema resolve , whether s/he enrol MAM SAM . Children MUAC &lt; 11.5 cm receive 175 kcal/kg/d RUTF . Caretakers instruct give child appropriate food child 's nutritional status . RUTF integrated program formulate comply new United Nations ( UN ) ready-to-use supplemental food ( RUSF ) requirement . RUTF 7.5 kg child 75 kcal/kg/d meet exceed Dietary Reference Intake , except calcium , phosphorus , potassium , riboflavin vitamin K , provide breast milk habitual diet . Children randomize integrate protocol group give six-week supply 50 g LNS complement home diet graduation . LNS mixture peanut butter , fat correct mixture micronutrient achieve one Required Daily Amounts ( RDA ) /d vitamin mineral . Coverage The Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling ( LQAS ) Evaluation Access Coverage ( SLEAC ) method use assess coverage . The ten treatment center ( five standard five integrate ) assess coverage use simple survey . SLEAC identify category coverage ( e.g . low , medium , high ) treatment center , accord threshold value , , calculate follow : n sample size p standard coverage evaluate . The Sphere minimum standard coverage 50 % rural area , 70 % urban area 90 % camp settings11 , p = 50 % coverage assessments rural area , = 21 scenario . The sample size treatment center , n , 42 ( single side test , 90 % power , 5 % significance control coverage estimate 20 % intervention coverage estimate 50 % ) . Since likely exact number case find , recalculate coverage assessment . Villages visit survey determine centric systematic area sample quadrat method ( selects villages visit base geographic location ) , list village systematically select village target catchment area program , depend whether map available . Sampling cease select village visit , regardless whether quota case achieve earlier . House-to-house sample must carry ensure MAM case find . This additionally allow discovery SAM case . Surveying 14 area 15 mid-level health management staff one principal surveyor require 44 day . It take staff size ~32 work day complete survey protocol . Data Analysis Anthropometric index calculate use Anthro v 3.1 ( WHO ) base WHO 's 2006 Child Growth Standards . Data tabulate analyzed use statistical computer program SPSS 13.0 Microsoft® Excel . A primary outcome recovery integrate program standard protocol . Recovery 1 , 3 6 month follow-up standard protocol compare integrate protocol . The primary outcome , coverage , assess compare survey data region ; number case find treat compare threshold value , , area categorize low , moderate high coverage . All coverage analysis carry accord previous publish method . Secondary outcome growth rate , duration treatment , cost estimate participation , reason default identification risk factor poor outcome . Comparisons treatment make use Chi-square test categorical outcome ANOVA continuous outcome . P &lt; 0.05 statistically significant . Specific Aim 2 conduct International Medical Corps ( IMC ) Specific Aim 2 : Evaluate effectiveness breastfeed education counsel breast milk intake 6-24 month-old child receive RUTF Sierra Leone . Hypothesis : An active , peer counsel program preserve/promote breastfeed MAM infant result great breast milk consumption standard care . Methods Subjects : Eligible subject child age 6-24 month enrol trial describe Specific Aim 1 reach MUAC &gt; 12.5 cm . IMC enroll child 6-24 month age whose caretaker participate enhance breastfeed counseling , carry Care Group model modify version tailor context research program . Study design IMC assist integrated program center implement one several Care Groups depend number 6-24 month old child enrol program . The key message group care giver focus appropriate complementary feeding continue breastfeed 6-24 month old child Ancillary message include family planning , health care seek behavior , safe hygiene practice . IMC train community health worker involve project one week intensive training Care Group approach support adequate complementary feed 6-24 month old . Participation Caretakers approach sub study enrollment immediately upon successful completion therapy MAM , interval child receive LNS . It anticipate child whose mother receive Care Group counsel great breast milk intake . There ample number eligible child study mother chooses participate drop agree , replacement easily find .</detailed_description>
