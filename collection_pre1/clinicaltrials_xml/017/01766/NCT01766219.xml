	<brief_title>CPI-613 Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Bile Duct Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety efficacy CPI-613 ( 6,8-bis [ benzylthio ] octanoic acid ) patient advance unresectable cholangiocarcinoma fail available therapy . OUTLINE : Pre-cycle : Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1-5 , 1 week prior course 1 . Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid IV 2 hour day 1 4 week 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond treatment may receive 4 course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow bimonthly .</detailed_description>
