	<detailed_description>Vitiligo chronic acquire disease characterize well define white macule patch affect skin mucous membrane . Mucocutaneous lesion develop secondary selective destruction melanocyte . It major psychosocial impact affect patient . The etiology vitiligo largely unknown likely multifactorial . There several theory pathogenesis vitiligo include mainly autoimmune , neurohormonal , autocytotoxic theory . The autoimmune hypothesis strong evidence alteration mainly cellular immune response . Diagnosis vitiligo usually make clinically . A skin biopsy rarely need diagnosis typically show absence melanin epidermis melanocyte . Perivascular inflammation find approximately 92 % case . Spontaneous repigmentation uncommon ( see 10-20 % patient ) vitiliginous patch occur . Repigmentation occur usually perifollicular pattern , suggest hair follicle function reservoir melanocyte . There many treatment modality available vitiligo , however , none cure disease . These include different topical treatment , phototherapy , surgical therapy , depigmentation therapy . Topical corticosteroid ( CS ) commonly use first-line therapy localize vitiligo . They effective monotherapy localize vitiligo . Studies show increase inflammatory cell vitiliginous skin , mainly macrophages T cell . Efficacy CS vitiligo attribute modulation immune response , reduction destruction melanocyte , induction melanocyte proliferation melanin production . Treatment intralesional corticosteroid ( ILCS ) commonly use many dermatologic condition . There study publish use ILCS vitiligo . Triamcinolone acetonide ( TA ) commonly use form ILCSs . It characterize low solubility , slowly absorb injection site , prompt maximal local action , limit diffusion spread tissue , give rise systemic side effect use therapeutic dos . The concentration commonly use dermatology 2.5 mg/ml . Side effect intralesional TA ( IL TA ) include pain injection site , mild bleeding , transient atrophy telangiectasia , hypopigmentation , hyperpigmentation . Infection uncommon caution bony prominence recommend . It show TA total dose 20 mg result adrenal suppression . Hypersensitivity reaction TA vehicle carboxymethylcellulose extremely rare . The investigator ' hypothesis IL TA induce significant skin pigmentation improve vitiligo . This due anti-inflammatory effect IL TA . IL TA successfully use treatment many skin condition autoimmune pathogenesis include alopecia areata . The investigator plan conduct prospective double-blind randomize clinical trial ass efficacy safety IL TA treatment vitiligo . Study Objectives 1 . To evaluate potential IL TA induce repigmentation within vitiligo patch . 2 . To assess side effect profile IL TA use treatment vitiligo .</detailed_description>
