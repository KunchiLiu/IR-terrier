	<detailed_description>At MGH BWH , HCW expose blood visibly bloody fluid refer immediately Occupational Health Services . The person whose blood body fluid source occupational exposure evaluate HBV , HCV , HIV infection . Information available medical record time exposure , source person , might confirm exclude bloodborne virus infection . If HBV , HCV , and/or HIV infection status source unknown , source patient inform incident test serologic evidence bloodborne virus infection , include HBsAg , HCV antibody , HIV antibody . Reactive result EIA anti-HCV confirm HCV RNA PCR , test use Roche COBAS TaqMan quantitative assay ( Roche Molecular Systems ) low limit quantitation &lt; 43 IU/ml . HCV RNA test perform twice weekly MGH BWH . In event source patient 's HCV antibody positive HCV RNA low limit detection , HCV Recombinant Immunoblot Assay ( RIBA ) order : RIBA negative , positive HCV antibody interpret false positive result , source patient infect HCV . If RIBA positive , source patient receive serial HCV RNA test For HCW expose HCV-positive source , HCV antibody test performed time exposure . Per standard practice recommend Partners Occupational Health Services , HCV RNA test HCW perform time exposure , unless HCV antibody test positive . For current study , HCW meet inclusion criterion ( specifically , exposure needlestick injury hollow-bore needle source patient anti-HCV ( + ) HCV RNA ( + ) ; HCW anti-HCV Ab negative ) interest enrol study , HCV RNA test eligible HCW perform initial visit . For potential study enrollment , patient directly refer Partners Occupational Health Services ( BWH MGH ) . They responsible contact study personnel pager . In event exposure occur Occupational Health Services office close , HCW evaluate Emergency Room per standard protocol , refer study personnel follow business day . The HCW screen interview person , patient appropriate exposure eligible inclusion . Study drug offer subject expose potentially HCV-infected blood needlestick injury hollow-bore needle . Blood intact skin consider low-risk , therefore , treatment recommend . Other unusual injuries/exposures include individual basis study physician . Once HCW sign inform consent participate study , he/she offer prescription PEP telaprevir 750 mg three time per day 4 week within five ( 5 ) day period his/her exposure . Telaprevir show interact HIV protease inhibitor reverse transcriptase inhibitor activity upon CYP3A enzyme . With respect interaction telaprevir HIV protease inhibitor , recommend co-administer darunavir/ritonavir , fosamprenavir/ritonavir , lopinavir/ritonavir telaprevir [ 19 ] . In addition , regard use reverse transcriptase inhibitor , concomitant administration telaprevir efavirenz result reduced steady-state exposure telaprevir efavirenz . Van Heeswijk et al conduct three open-label , randomize cross-over trial among HIV HCV negative healthy volunteer , find therapeutic level telaprevir , efavirenz , tenofovir maintain telaprevir dose increase 1250 mg three-times daily . As result interaction , case HCW expose HCV HIV elect take HIV PEP , telaprevir offer HCV PEP one follow HIV PEP regimens prescribe : 1 . Tenofovir/Emtricitabine ( Truvada ) + Atazanavir/Ritonavir 2 . Tenofovir/Emtricitabine ( Truvada ) + Raltegravir All decision regard post-exposure prophylaxis HCW expose HCV HIV discuss HIV/ID fellow . Furthermore , HCW HIV-infected receive HAART time study enrollment , discussion hold study team Infectious Disease specialist manage HAART regimen HCW , order determine whether patient could safely take telaprevir HCV PEP . The HCW anti-HCV testing perform , along store serum lookbacks necessary , current protocol Occupational Health . In addition usual laboratory draw occupational health ( HCV antibody week 0 , HCV RNA week 4 12 ) , blood count include differential require prior consideration study drug . At week 4 , enrol patient quantitative HCV viral load testing ( regardless treatment election ) . If HCV RNA detectable , HCW refer GI/Hepatology consideration intensify antiviral therapy . If negative patient treatment arm , telaprevir discontinue time . At week 12 24 , HCV RNA test repeat . If positive , patient refer intensified antiviral therapy . Week 24 HCV RNA test necessary look possibility early prophylaxis telaprevir delay onset hepatitis C infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MGH BWH health care worker exposure needlestick injury hollowbore needle source patient antiHCV ( + ) HCV RNA ( + ) HCW antiHCV Ab negative . HCW expose needlestick injury hollowbore needle source patient antiHCV ( + ) HCV RNA ( ) , regardless RIBA result , eligible study . In addition , effort make identify source patient 's genotype , genotype unknown , genotype testing perform . If genotype 2 3 , HCW expose source patient eligible study . HCW eligible expose source patient genotype 1 , genotype source patient unknown unable ascertain Exposure patient know HCV genotype 2 3 HCV Ab positive HCV Ab negative HCV RNA &gt; 1000 IU/ml Active malignancy Other condition opinion investigator occupational health make telaprevir contraindicate HCW Subjects preexist end stage renal impairment severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh B C ) , anemia ( start hemoglobin 10 less ) exclude . Pregnant woman exclude study . All female participant reproductive potential undergo pregnancy test ( specifically qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin ) , test positive eligible study inclusion . Women pregnant elect enroll study advise hormonal contraceptive may reliable study period two week follow cessation study drug . During time , female patient childbearing potential use two nonhormonal method effective birth control , example include male condom spermicidal jelly OR female condom spermicidal jelly ( combination male condom female condom suitable ) , diaphragm spermicidal jelly , cervical cap spermicidal jelly , intrauterine device ( IUD ) .</criteria>
