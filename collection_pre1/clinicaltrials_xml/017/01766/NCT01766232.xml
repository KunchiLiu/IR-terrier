	<detailed_description>Lacrimal Drainage Resistance I . Introduction This proposal describe plan study resistance lacrimal drainage system irrigation . II . Research Aims A . Specific Aims 1 . To quantitatively measure resistance lacrimal drainage system irrigation . 2 . To determine difference lacrimal drainage resistance patient obstruct tear drainage system patient functional tear pump failure . 3 . To measure pressure generate traditional probe irrigation lacrimal drainage system . B . Background Significance Epiphora , uncontrolled tear eye , represent common present complaint patient see ophthalmologist . Epiphora may due non-obstructive cause , tear hypersecretion functional tear pump failure , obstructive cause . Functional tear pump failure may result malposition eyelid , abnormal out-turning ( ectropion ) in-turning ( entropion ) eyelid . Tears normally drain eye two small hole , call puncta , one locate upper eyelid one low eyelid , two channel , call canaliculus , empty lacrimal sac . Tears drain lacrimal sac bony nasolacrimal duct nasal cavity . Obstruction may occur level system , may partial complete . [ 1 ] The focus study acquire ( opposed congenital ) , nasolacrimal duct obstruction . The normal work-up evaluation nasolacrimal duct obstruction include multiple clinical test evaluate patency drainage system , include fluorescein dye disappearance test , primary secondary Jones dye test , canalicular probe irrigation ( P &amp; I ) . While complete obstruction relatively easily determine , partial obstruction difficult . Each available test qualitative nature unable determine degree partial obstruction . [ 1 , 2 ] Current management option treatment partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction include repeat canalicular probe irrigation , balloon catheter dilation placement silicone stent , dacryocystorhinostomy ( DCR ) surgery . Repeated probe irrigation may perform clinic without anesthesia , low rate improve symptom . Balloon catheter dilation stent placement typically perform general anesthesia , require incision , success rate 60-73 % . [ 3 , 4 ] . DCR surgery , also typically perform general anesthesia , surgically bypass nasolacrimal duct remove window bone anastomose lacrimal sac nasal cavity . The success rate DCR 95 % . [ 1 , 5 ] There two previously publish method measure lacrimal drainage resistance . In 1991 , Stanley Masri describe device measure resistance hand-held instrument connect personal computer . [ 6 ] They report value 13 normal control , test device patient tear . In 1995 , Tucker et al . report laboratory-based device measure resistance fluid flow lacrimal drainage system . [ 2 ] They measure resistance healthy control , patient successful DCR , one tearing patient . The investigator measure pressure generate conventional P &amp; I use disposable in-line pressure transducer . In addition , investigator use syringe pump deliver constant flow rate saline nasolacrimal cannula measure steady state irrigation pressure use in-line transducer digital pressure monitor . Resistance directly calculate know flow rate pressure measurement . Clinical application measure lacrimal drainage resistance include quantify partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction , guide choice surgical procedure , determine success lacrimal drainage procedure . III . Study Design Methods Study Design : The investigator plan measure lacrimal drainage resistance consent patient undergo evaluation management epiphora require traditional probing irrigation . In addition traditional probe irrigation nasolacrimal system , investigator measure lacrimal drainage resistance use study equipment . Accrual Goals Recruitment Period : The accrual goal study 40 eligible patient . The final clinical diagnosis lacrimal drainage obstruction versus functional tear pump failure base upon investigator clinical finding standard probe irrigation result . Patient Entry : Patient eligibility determine study 's principal investigator co-investigators describe protocol . The investigator interview eligible patient explain detail purpose study . Those patient agree participate pressure measure conventional P &amp; I lacrimal drainage resistance measure addition normal clinical work-up . For patient agree participate study , sign informed consent constitutes study entry . Time Requirement : The investigator estimate take 2 month patient accrual measurement . Follow-Up : There require follow-up visit . Measurement outcome : Two measurement obtain patient . First , investigator record pressure generate traditional probe irrigation use disposable in-line pressure transducer . Second , investigator measure pressure generate use syringe pump deliver constant flow rate . The investigator directly calculate resistance irrigation pressure flow rate . IV . Study Procedure : The Intervention Probing irrigation ( P &amp; I ) lacrimal drainage system standard component evaluation tear patient . During procedure , nasolacrimal cannula insert canaliculus saline solution irrigate system . The investigator measure pressure generate P &amp; I use disposable in-line pressure transducer . In addition conventional P &amp; I , consent patient would undergo second irrigation procedure use measure equipment . In order eliminate bias due order testing , half patient undergo conventional P &amp; I first , half undergo experimental P &amp; I first . During experimental P &amp; I , syringe pump deliver constant flow rate saline nasolacrimal cannula . The investigator measure steady state irrigation pressure use in-line transducer digital pressure monitor . Resistance calculate know flow rate pressure measurement . The investigator obtain three measurement patient . The syringe pump design prevent backflow saline , addition disposable portion pressure transducer expose saline change patient . The syringe pump automatic safety cut-off line occlude . V. Interpretation Data The investigator record pressure generate conventional P &amp; I average pressure generate steady-state irrigation . Resistance directly calculate average pressure measurement . The investigator compare pressure generate P &amp; I lacrimal drainage resistance patient lacrimal drainage obstruction control patient obstruction ( functional tear pump failure ) determine clinical exam . The investigator summarize data term mean standard deviation . The null hypothesis , difference group , test two-sample Students t-test p &lt; .05 rejection null . For lacrimal drainage resistance , sample size 17 patient per group give power 0.91 detect difference small 20 mmHg*sec/ml . The power measurement base upon work Tucker et al. , measure average resistance 49.5 +/- 17.0 mmHg*sec/ml normal control , single measurement 212 mmHg*sec/ml patient symptomatic tearing . [ 2 ] Technical complication note describe . All patient information part permanent medical record different information document standard nasolacrimal irrigation . VI . Consent Procedure In addition verbal discussion describe study , include risk benefit , investigator provide patient undergoing evaluation epiphora include conventional probe irrigation formal consent form , investigator provide copy consent personal reference . The proposed consent form attach . VII . Adverse Events The anticipated adverse event conventional probe irrigation anxiety discomfort procedure , foreign body sensation 12-24 hour follow procedure , irrigant dye clothing . Anticipated serious adverse event conventional probe irrigation include dacryocystitis damage lacrimal drainage system include punctal rupture . The incremental risk experimental probe irrigation relate pump device . Because pump device automatic safety cut-off push fluid low flow rate ( 0.09 mL/s ) investigator believe incremental risk low . Stanley Masri report one case punctal rupture use experimental setup . [ 6 ] The investigator believe unlikely occur experiment investigator use standard nasolacrimal cannula irrigate , investigator use much low flow rate ( 0.09 mL/s versus 0.25 mL/s ) . All adverse event document data collection form bring attention patient family soon possible occurrence . Patients provide contact information principle investigator well Institutional Review Board consent form , on-call ophthalmologist always available emergent care hour . On-call ophthalmologist direct pager access investigator notify immediately adverse event encounter study patient . Serious unanticipated adverse event promptly report Institutional Review Board principle investigator . VII . Cited Literature 1 . Mills , D.M . D.R . Meyer , Acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction .
