	<brief_summary>This study determine whether likely success closing hole eardrum predict test Eustachian tube function . The Eustachian tube natural tube connects back nose middle ear . When person go airplane ear `` pop '' one yawn ears `` pop '' , Eustachian tube opening . The Eustachian tube responsible keep air pressure middle ear environment keep middle ear free fluid . It think child middle-ear disease , muscle open Eustachian tube work well ; seem get well many child get old . It think poor Eustachian tube function cause failures hole eardrum patch also recurrence fluid middle-ear . The primary goal study see whether predict , base test Eustachian tube function surgery , whether patch eardrum successful whether fluid come back ear patch .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve 1 visit Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh UPMC Eustachian tube function test 2 visit , approximately 6 month 12 month , surgery examine ear . Entry ( Visit 1 ; approximately 40-60 minute ) At entry visit , child 's medical history review ensure he/she eligible study . The parent ask question family , include family size , pet , medical history , tobacco smoke exposure , education occupation , living condition . They also ask question child , regard thing breastfeeding , daycare , tobacco smoke exposure allergy , detailed history middle-ear disease record . The child examination ear , nose throat . Tympanometry do , help tell whether fluid middle ear whether opening/hole eardrum . This common office procedure do insert small probe ( rubber plastic tube measure ear pressure ) half way ear canal changing pressure probe . That pressure change small , felt rarely associate discomfort . The function child 's Eustachian tube side eardrum go patch test . A small ear plug seal partway child 's ear canal . This plug attach machine change pressure ear measure pressure Eustachian tube open close , well ease airflow Eustachian tube ability open Eustachian tube swallow . The test require child pull ear plug his/her ear perform certain ( age-appropriate ) procedure design open his/her Eustachian tube swallow open pinch nose , blow close nose deep breathing . The total time test 20 minute period break time rest time test . If child hole eardrums go repair , test may take 40 minute . After entry testing : The child 's ear surgeon take picture eardrum time surgery document size hole . If child require another surgical procedure surgery close eardrum failure hole close recurrence ear problem infection fluid ear , child study visit examination ear , nose throat well tympanometry approximately 6 month 12 month surgery . If see ear surgeon around time , study visit clinic visit do time .</detailed_description>
