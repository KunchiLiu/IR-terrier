This study do see proton radiation therapy prove beneficial woman early stage breast cancer . A clinical study necessary compare result ( good bad ) proton radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Protocol Proton Therapy Partial Breast Irradiation Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current standard care early stage breast cancer mastectomy breast conserve therapy whole breast irradiation follow lumpectomy . However , study breast cancer recurrence demonstrate majority tumor recur adjacent original tumor site . The question thus raise whether radiation whole breast necessary justified . Limiting radiation area original tumor may reduce acute long-term skin organ toxicity make radiation therapy convenient less expensive . Several clinical trial underway compare partial breast irradiation ( PBI ) whole breast irradiation . Numerous center offer partial breast irradiation outside clinical trial well , despite lack long-term safety efficacy data PBI . Available PBI method include brachytherapy , catheter balloon surgically insert deliver radiation therapy lumpectomy cavity , conventional external beam radiation therapy , EBRT . External beam photon therapy attractive non-invasive nature ability deliver homogenous dose distribution compare brachytherapy , however also deliver great radiation dose surround normal breast tissue.Proton therapy capacity provide advantage photon EBRT minimize dose normal surround tissue . Clinical data PBI proton minimal , however , leave many question unanswered . The impetus behind protocol address gap investigate feasibility , safety , efficacy proton therapy partial breast irradiation .</detailed_description>
