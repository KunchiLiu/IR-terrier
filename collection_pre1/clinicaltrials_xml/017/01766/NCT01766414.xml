	<brief_summary>Excessive inflammation associate tissue damage cause over-activation innate immune system . This range mild disease extreme condition , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) acute respiratory distress ( ARDS ) . In marked contrast adaptive immunity sensitive immune modulators steroid , innate immune system sufficiently target currently available anti-inflammatory drug . The investigator hypothesize pre-treatment C1-esterase inhibitor human endotoxemia model modulate innate immune response . In study , human endotoxemia use model inflammation . Subjects , prior endotoxin administration , receive C1 esterase inhibitor placebo . Blood sample determine level marker innate immune response .</brief_summary>
