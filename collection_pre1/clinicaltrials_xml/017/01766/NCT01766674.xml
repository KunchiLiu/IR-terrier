	<brief_title>Specialized Centers Research ( SCOR ) Sex Differences - Kyphosis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants assign intervention group receive high-intensity spinal strengthen group exercise program 1 hour twice per week 12 week , home practice . The exercise program outline Table 2 . The participant assign control group receive usual care enrol waitlist group . A physical therapist teach high-intensity spine strengthen exercise intervention session . Additionally , physical therapy graduate student attend exercise session help ensure safety participant maintain ratio five participant one teacher . Participants control group crossover spinal strengthening exercise group 12 week receive intervention 12 week . All potential participant screen initially medical screen exam , primary care provider contact study physician approval study participation . The participant sign medical release give primary care provider permission release medical information study physician . The primary outcome change Cobb angle kyphosis 12 week calculate measurement take lateral spine radiograph change Physical Performance Test ( PPT ) . The investigator also assess effect exercise intervention secondary outcomes physical function , strength quality life . The investigator also use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) determine bone mineral density study intervention . Study participant receive actigraph measure physical activity throughout study . For participant control group crossover exercise intervention group 12 week receive additional lateral spine radiograph end intervention . Both group receive copy study exercise DVD end study . Table 2 . Exercise Intervention Exercises Spinal strengthening exercise ( 20 min ) 10-12 repetition 70-80 % 1RM Progress 0 - 5 # theraband Spinal mobility exercise ( 10 min ) Passive 30 second hold Warm-up ( 10 min ) Increase core temperature aerobic warm-up bike/treadmill Prone trunk lift neutral Spine mobilization roller Quadruped arm/leg lift Standing shoulder flexion/thoracic extension Cool-down ( 5 min ) Bilateral latissimus pull-down roller Quadruped thoracic extension mobilization Neck upper extremity stretch Sidelying rotation extension Spinal alignment ( 15 min ) Transversus abdominous strengthen Training bilateral single leg stance Lower extremity stretch Wall push-ups spine neutral Training sit-to stand , squat , lunge Diaphragmatic breathing</detailed_description>
