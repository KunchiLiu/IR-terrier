	<brief_summary>A breast biopsy operate room may need 15 % patient abnormality mammogram . When abnormality present palpable mass , abnormality must localize wire go operating room . This technique also use breast cancer present mass , order perform target lumpectomy . Once abnormality surgically remove , specimen wire take breast image department specimen x-ray ensure target abnormality present within specimen . If abnormality close edge specimen , additional tissue often remove . A new method evaluate specimen perform image operating room . Portable digital mammography unit available purpose . The Biovision digital specimen mammography system FDA-approved currently use 200 center United States . Several study show intra-operative digital mammography accurate standard specimen mammography take less time perform . It may also decrease chance go back operate room take breast tissue lumpectomy cancer cell near teh margin ( ) specimen final pathology . Having go back operate room take tissue call re-excision . The purpose study compare standard specimen mammography intra-operative specimen mammography quantify potential operating room time saving determine use intra-operative specimen mammography decrease re-excision rate . We aim see intra-operative specimen mammography efficient decrease re-excision rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start patient undergo screening procedure determine patient eligible participate . This include medical history assessment patient 's breast abnormality mammogram and/or ultrasound and/or breast MRI . Patients need undergo extra procedure apart need patient 's surgeon plan patient 's breast surgery . If screening process show patient eligible participate research study , patient enrol study proceed day surgery . If patient meet eligibility criterion patient able participate research study . Patients assign one two arm study day surgery . Because one know breast specimen image option best , patient `` randomize '' one study group : Standard Specimen Mammography arm , Intra-operative Specimen Mammography arm . Randomization mean patient put group chance . It like flip coin . Neither patient surgeon choose group patient . If patient Standard Specimen Mammography arm , patient 's breast specimen ( biopsy lumpectomy ) take Breast Imaging department mammogram , way breast specimens typically image . If patient Intra-Operative Specimen Mammography arm , patient 's breast specimen image right operating room time surgery . The patient 's image also link Breast Imaging department , radiologist confirm surgeon 's finding .</detailed_description>
