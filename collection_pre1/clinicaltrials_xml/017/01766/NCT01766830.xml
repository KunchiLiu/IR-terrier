	<brief_summary>Tropical fever diagnostic challenge antiquity . Nowadays , despite availability good diagnostic capacity , undifferentiated febrile illness continue thorny problem travel physician . In develop country , scarcity skilled personnel adequate laboratory facility make differential diagnosis fever even complex . Health care worker must often rely syndrome-oriented empirical approach treatment might overestimate underestimate likelihood certain disease . For instance Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTD ) contribute substantially burden persistent ( 1 week ) fever Tropics , cause considerable mortality major disability . These disease however rarely diagnosed primary health care ( PHC ) level . The difficulty establish cause febrile illness result omission delay treatment , irrational prescription polytherapy , increase cost development drug resistance . In resource-limited setting , clinical algorithm constitute valuable aid health worker , facilitate therapeutic decision absence good laboratory capacity . There critical lack appropriate diagnostic tool guide treatment NTDs . While clinical algorithm develop NTDs , case remain empirical . Besides , rarely take account local prevalence data , adequately represent spectrum patient differential diagnosis primary care level often properly validate . The purpose study develop evidence-based Rapid Diagnostic Test ( RDT ) -supported diagnostic guideline patient persistent fever ( ≥ 1 week ) Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) , Sudan , Cambodia Nepal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Diagnostic Tests Clinical/Laboratory Predictors Tropical Diseases In Patients With Persistent Fever Cambodia , Nepal , Democratic Republic Congo Sudan ( NIDIAG-Fever )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study part large European Union ( EU ) -funded research project call NIDIAG aim develop integrated , evidence-based syndromic approach improve management NTD-related clinical syndrome . NIDIAG target three non-specific clinical syndrome : persistent fever , neurological , intestinal syndrome . The objective project establish diagnostic guideline syndrome , particular focus severe treatable neglect infectious disease . The developed guideline integrate relevant Point-of-Care ( POC ) test . The persistent fever syndrome target NIDIAG define presence fever least one week . The list diseases - NTD Infectious Diseases ( ID ) - frequently cause persistent ( ≥1 week ) fever study country include : Visceral Leishmaniasis ( VL ) , Human Africa Trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) , Enteric ( typhoid , paratyphoid ) fever , Malaria , Brucellosis , Melioidosis , Tuberculosis , Amoebic liver abscess , Relapsing fever , HIV , Rickettsial diseases , Leptospirosis . The study try identify clinical laboratory predictor diseases well validate exist RDTs .</detailed_description>
