	<brief_summary>Background : - 18F-CP18 chemical design use image study . It attract tumor cell kill cancer treatment . Researchers want test imaging study people treat Birinapant . Birinapant drug use treat advanced ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . It work kill tumor cell respond earlier treatment . 18F-CP18 may help monitor cancer treatment drug . Objectives : - To test effectiveness 18F-CP18 imaging study cancer treatment Birinapant . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age take Birinapant ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . Design : - Participants brief physical exam . They also answer question medical history current medication . - Participants receive dose 18F-CP18 , follow image study . The study involve positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) scan . The scan last 40 minute . - There two PET/CT scan 1 hour 2 hour take 18F-CP18 . These scan look tumor cell absorb process 18F-CP18 . - This scanning study . No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Dysregulation apoptosis instrumental forming malignant phenotype associate resistance chemotherapeutics biological therapy . Cleaved Caspase 3 ( activate form ) play key role common apoptotic pathway . CP18 enzyme substrate caspase 3 . The formulation [ 18F ] -CP18 include PEG vector facilitate internalization non-invasively imaged use PET . Once cleave polar fragment caspase 3 , become trap within cell . In phase 2 NCI clinical trial ( NCI Protocol ( # 12C0191 ) CTEP 9235 ) , Birinapant ( TL32711 ) , SMAC ( second mitochondrial derive activator caspase ) mimetic , evaluate patient relapse platinum resistant refractory epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer . PET/CT image [ 18F ] -CP18 may enable non-invasive , vivo monitoring drug pro-apoptotic effect . If measureable effect show pilot study , evaluation [ 18F ] -CP18 PET/CT potential monitor apoptosis may warrant . Primary Objective : To determine tumor uptake retention [ 18F ] -CP18 treatment SMAC mimetic ( Birinapant , TL32711 ) , patient relapse platinum resistant refractory epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer . Eligibility : All subject must meet eligibility criterion phase 2 study Birinapant ( NCI Protocol ( # 12C0191 ) CTEP 9235 ) enrol plan enroll parent therapy protocol All subject must sign document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study protocol relate study perform . Design : This pilot study assess change [ 18F ] -CP18 PET tumor uptake follow treatment Birinapant , SMAC mimetic drug , patient relapse platinum resistant refractory epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer . Subjects undergo least 3 [ 18F ] -CP18 PET/CT image study , one pre-therapy , one within 48 hour receive initial dose Birinapant , third scan within 48 hour receive cycle 2 , day 15 dose Birinapant prior tumor biopsy day . An exploration relationship PET image parameter clinical response various biomarkers ( determine refer protocol ) also perform . Ten patient enrol protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects pathology proven epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer relapse refractory prior platinumbased standard care systemic regimen , enrol , eligible enrol Phase 2 NCI protocol treatment use Birinapant ( NCI Protocol ( # 12C0191 ) CTEP 9235 ) ; therefore must meet inclusion criterion study Ability provide inform consent . All patient must sign document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study protocol relate study perform . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Known allergy formulation component [ 18F ] CP18 . The subject pregnant nursing Participants enrollment would significantly delay ( &gt; 2 week ) schedule standard care therapy . Participants coexist medical psychiatric condition likely interfere study procedure and/or result exclude . Participants severe claustrophobia relieve oral anxiolytic medication patient weigh &gt; 136 kg ( weight limit scanner table ) . Other medical condition deem PI associate make patient ineligible protocol procedure . It likely patient study surgically sterile . If case , patient must negative serum beta HCG within 24 hour prior PET/CT postmenopausal great equal 2 year</criteria>
