	<brief_title>Effects Spinal Manipulative Treatment Inflammatory Markers Low Back Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Spinal manipulative treatment ( SMT ) may work reduce mechanical irritation joint tissue ( 1 ) thereby diminish local inflammation . Evidence anti-inflammatory effect instrument-assisted SMT observe animal model ( 2 ) . These finding consistent recently propose hypothesis origin pain may associate inflammation augment production inflammatory mediator ( cytokine ) , principally TNFα ( 3 ) . TNFα play major role pathophysiology neuropathic pain-associated inflammation ( 4 ) implicate spinal pain syndrome , include intervertebral disc-related low back pain ( 5 , 6 ) sciatica ( 7,8 ) . Our recent study demonstrate production inflammatory mediator elevate patient chronic cervical spine pain , vitro vivo , accompany up-regulation chemokine ( CC ) synthesis ( 9 ) . Recent report clinical ( 10 ) , animal ( 2 ) human vitro model ( 11 ) suggest SMT may exert anti-inflammatory effect . Thus , Song et al . ( 2 ) find SMT reduce inflammatory neuropathic pain . Teodorczyk-Injeyan et al . ( 11 ) demonstrate significant attenuation pro-inflammatory cytokine production vitro , change serum substance P ( SP ) level follow SMT . Other study laboratory show SMT may enhance production response immunomodulatory cytokine , IL-2 , IL-2-dependent antibody synthesis ( 12 , 13 ) . Reduction serum TNFα level report cervicogenic headache patient ( n=2 , case study ) ( 14 , 15 ) . These observation suggest SMT effect may transduce cellular component immune system . Thus far , clinical relevance effect SMT modulator inflammatory mediator production unknown . Despite evidence inflammatory pathophysiology spinal pain ( 16 ) , include subtype non-specific spinal pain ( 17 ) , one clinical study ( 18 ) evaluate correlation serum TNFα level , pain intensity back function . In propose study intend use clinical model investigate baseline level proinflammatory cytokine acute chronic low back pain patient explore potential anti-inflammatory effect SMT follow course manipulative treatment . Thus , Aim 1 determine baseline pro-inflammatory cytokine level individual experience acute chronic lower spinal pain mechanical etiology , compare asymptomatic control ' . Aim 2 explore relationship SMT , pain level functional impairment , production inflammatory mediator relative baseline . Anti-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-10 IL-1ra ) find produce alongside , parallel , respective pro-inflammatory counterpart ( TNFα IL-1β ) , act concert sustain/restore homeostasis ( 19 ) . The propose study include determination , addition pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , TNFα , IL-6 ) level , level IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra ) IL-10 . Assessment IL-10 synthesis particularly relevant cytokine up-regulates production IL-1ra , compete active IL-1 bind IL-1 receptor , act potent natural anti-inflammatory protein ( 19 , 20 ) . Study design ; Subject Recruitment : Subjects ( volunteer ) sex , age 20 60 year , experience acute ( le 4 week duration ) chronic ( 12 week long duration ) mechanical low back pain ( experienced spinal level L1- L5 , without sacroiliac [ SI ] joint involvement ) recruit Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College ( CMCC ) personnel poster CMCC 's outpatient clinic , general public newspaper advertisement . CMCC Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) , population diverse ethnic mix ( 21 ) . Potential participant present one CMCC clinic purpose treatment encouraged/recruited interns/clinicians prior commencement treatment . Others present participate research study first assign one clinic pod initial assessment prior enter study . In case , however , participant receive SMT 4 week prior commencement study . Candidates interview order determine eligibility ( see exclusion criterion , Appendix 1 ) . They complete research intake form ( Appendix 2 ) give detailed explanation research protocol ( Appendix 3 ) . A cohort match healthy asymptomatic subject , recruit general population , serve control determination baseline cytokine level . Sample size determination : Data publish TNFα level chronic neck pain patient versus asymptomatic control ( 9 ) use calculate sample size estimate study . The study power primary outcome measure relate Question 1 , look difference symptomatic asymptomatic low back pain subject baseline ( see Statistical Analyses ) . From Cohen 's table ( 22 ) , base power 0.8 , two-tailed test p value &lt; 0.05 , sample size estimate 17 per group . In order account drop-outs error may arise blood culture , sample size increase 20 per group . As result , 40 symptomatic subject 20 asymptomatic control , provide adequate sample test primary outcome . Subject assessment group assignment : Qualified subject schedule . They greet one two investigator ( depend recruitment site ) , brief review intake/eligibility form ( Appendix 3 ) confirm eligibility ask sign inform consent form ( Appendix 4 ) . All subject ask indicate pain intensity level 10-point visual analogue scale ( VAS ) complete Oswestry functional disability questionnaire . They assess standard chiropractic , orthopaedic neurological test respective chiropractic intern supervise clinician , assign acute chronic LBP group , formulate explain treatment plan.. For duration study , treatment consist manual SMT , need , manual ( instrument-assisted ) soft tissue work provide clinician . Other treatment modality use . Patients receive 6 treatment course 2 week . ( comprised manipulation one lumbar sacroiliac articulation , without soft tissue therapy ) . SMT consist single high velocity , low amplitude ( HVLA ) thrust intend cavitate restore mobility joint . If initial presentation manipulative segment could identify , patient exclude study . If hand manipulable segment find subsequent visit , clinician limit treatment palpation soft tissue work indicate . In case blood sample drawn ( see ) initial assessment prior commencement treatment patient , order establish baseline level cytokine participant ( primary outcome ) . At 7th visit ( least 2 day last treatment ) , blood sample take prior commencement treatment , ask complete exit questionnaire include VAS ( Appendix 5 ) . Should patient recover follow treatment , assess subjective feedback patient VAS result less 3/10 , blood sample take earlier duly noted . Should patient require continued treatment beyond 6 stipulated study , s/he free direction clinician charge case . Interventions : Manipulation : As note , spinal manipulation consist HVLA thrust affect segment ( 23 ) . A clinician deliver treatment accord his/her assessment finding give day . Venipuncture : On day admission study completion SMT therapy , experienced phlebotomist perform venipuncture use standard procedure ( antecubital fossa , 21gauge needle ) seat position . Heparinized blood sample ( 10 ml ) collect transfer ( room temperature ) laboratory within hour collection preparation whole blood culture describe . Laboratory study 1 . Induction inflammatory cytokine To assess cytokine production vitro , whole blood ( WB ) culture system utilized ( 19 ) . Briefly , multiple set WB culture represent different treatment/culture condition subject prepared . Cultures stimulate initiation 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction TNFα IL-1β production . Phytohemagglutinin ( PHA , 10 µg/ml ) alone combination LPS use induce production anti-inflammatory cytokine , IL-10 2 chemokines , CCL2 CCL3 . Cultures maintain 37C ( Celsius ) humidify 5 % C02 incubator . As clinical condition involve inflammatory response may cause time shift capacity cytokine production ( 19 , 27 ) , level study mediator ( TNFα , IL-1β , IL-1ra , IL-10 , CCL2 CCL3 ) examine 24 h interval culture supernatant harvest 24-72h post-initiation . Aliquots supernatant store -76C ( Celsius ) test . This model allow investigation relation release pro- anti-inflammatory mediator . 2 . Determinations cytokine level enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay The level TNFα , IL-1β , IL-10 IL-1ra supernatant whole blood culture determine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) use DuoSet ELISA development system natural recombinant human cytokine ( R &amp; D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) describe previously ( 9 , 11 ) , Quantikine Immunoassay Kits use CCL2 CCL3 determination . All immunoassay procedure , include reagent sample diluent preparation , carry per manufacturer 's recommendation . Each study sample test least twice 2-4 different dilution . Statistical analysis All study mediator measure LBP patient asymptomatic subject baseline completion treatment period . For Question 1 ( primary outcome ) , baseline comparison TNFα IL-1β compare symptomatic subject ( acute chronic ) versus asymptomatic control subject . Two unpaired t-tests use test associate hypothesis . For Question 2 , mean pre-post difference score compare TNFα IL-1β three group ( acute , chronic asymptomatic ) use ANOVA . If baseline value significantly different group ( hypothesize Question 1 ) , ANCOVA use account difference . It anticipate sample size sufficiently large accommodate analysis . However , determine result Question 2 , power analysis complete . If study insufficiently power question , another sample size estimate calculate inform future work . For pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine measure study , regression modeling use attempt predict cytokine response . It understand model create process need confirm future investigation . Both model create descriptive data derive investigation use inform future work . Time frame Based experience , 5 subject per week test . However , base condition prevalence , project patient recruitment sample collection take 8-12 month . Cytokine level determination cell culture derive three group participant lag behind 3-4 month , data analysis complete within another 2 month . Preparation manuscripts require additional 4-6 month . Thus anticipate completing project within 18 -24 month initiation study .</detailed_description>
