	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Proof Concept Study Patients With Parkinson 's Disease End-of-dose Motor Fluctuations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , double-blind , double-dummy , active-controlled , crossover , multicentre , phase II proof concept study patient PD end-of-dose motor fluctuation . The patient 's individually optimised daily levodopa regimen must keep stable least 2 week randomisation . The patient randomise receive ODM-101 65 mg carbidopa , ODM-101 105 mg carbidopa Stalevo速 accord 3-period crossover design . The study consist screen period , 3 treatment period post-treatment period . For patient , 9 visit : screen visit perform 7-28 day randomisation , randomisation visit ( visit 1 ) , 6 visit 3 treatment period ( i.e . 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 week randomisation start study treatment ; visit 2-7 ) , end-of-study visit 7-21 day last visit last treatment period . The duration study 14-23 week patient . The patient switch study drug assessment do visit 1 . The strength levodopa study drug determine patient 's individually optimise levodopa regimen randomisation . During first 2 week treatment period , patient 's levodopa strength ( frequency ) study drug adjust necessary investigator . For remain 2 week treatment period , levodopa strength keep stable . Unscheduled visit maybe perform first 2 week treatment period , need adjust levodopa strength . In case patient contact study centre within week start treatment period , study personnel phone patient ensure symptom possible adverse event ( AEs ) sufficiently control capture , assess need adjust levodopa treatment .</detailed_description>

An average 3.0 hour time , minimum 0.5 hour time day ( use PD home diary [ hereafter diary ] ) 3 consecutive day decision entry . Treatment 38 daily dos levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor ( DDCI ) entacapone ( either levodopa/DDCI combine Comtess速/Comtan速 Stalevo速 ) without entacapone , include daily use soluble levodopa formulation , total daily levodopa dose range 4001400 mg. One evening dose controlledrelease formulation levodopa/DDCI allow provide included total daily levodopa dose range 4001400 mg mention . Use additional soluble levodopa formulation rescue treatment , Madopar LT Quick , maximum 4 dos per week allow ; however , use avoid day PD status ( diary ) record . The levodopa dose rescue soluble levodopa formulation include range total daily dose levodopa indicate . Unchanged levodopa/DDCI without entacapone antiparkinsonian medication ( dopamine agonist , monoamine oxidase [ MAO ] B inhibitor , amantadine and/or anticholinergic dos recommend manufacturer ) , , least 4 week prior screen visit . Age 30 year . Secondary atypical parkinsonism . Current use tolcapone ( within 6 week prior first treatment period ) . Previous tolerability problem entacapone tolcapone . Concomitant treatment apomorphine , MAOA inhibitor nonselective MAO inhibitor . Concomitant treatment drug antidopaminergic action include alphamethyldopa , reserpine antipsychotic drug ( also dopamine D2 receptor block antiemetic except domperidone ) . As exception prohibition use antipsychotic drug , 1 even dose atypical antipsychotic allow . Severe dyskinesia judge investigator ; however , mild moderate dyskinesia significantly affect patient 's activity daily live allow . Currently active hallucination . Severe orthostatic hypotension judge investigator . Current dementia ( MiniMental State Examination [ MMSE ] score &lt; 24 ) . Problematic impulse control disorder ( ICD ) pathological gambling , hypersexuality compulsive shopping within 6 month prior screen visit . History neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) and/or nontraumatic ( druginduced ) rhabdomyolysis . Past current treatment deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgical treatment PD . Narrowangle glaucoma pheochromocytoma . Any active malignant cancer . Patients preplanned elective surgery likely change impact control PD symptom , involve hospitalisation . Failure demonstrate acceptable/appropriate use diary , despite adequate training , screen visit separate training session screen period .</criteria>
