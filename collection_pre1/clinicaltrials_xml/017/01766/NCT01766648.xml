	<brief_summary>To determine Far Cortical Locking screw increase fracture heal rate 3 month Closed Distal Femur Fractures adult compare standard lock screw construct . Fracture heal 3 month assess via x-ray clinical assessment fracture . Null Hypothesis : There difference fracture heal 3 month post-fixation subject treat far cortical lock screw standard lock screw fixation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Far Cortical Locking Versus Standard Constructs Distal Femur Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicentre randomize control trial Sample size 130 subject . Primary Outcome fracture heal 3 month via x-ray clinical assessment . Radiographic healing define bridge two cortex see x-ray . Radiographic assessment centrally adjudicate committee three study investigator . Clinical healing assess use Function Index Trauma ( FIX-IT ) . ( Bhandari et al , data press ) Secondary outcome measurement include patient-reported quality life CT quantification fracture callus volume . Quality life measure Short-Form 36 Version 2 ( SF-36 ) instrument follow-up interval . A CT scan fracture site perform 3 month follow-up . Using quantitative protocol volume callus measure extent cortical bridging assess . Additional secondary outcome include radiographic patient-important complication . These include adverse event , delay union ( &gt; 6 month ) , non union ( failure fracture heal progress serial x-ray 6 9 month ) , malalignment ( &gt; 5 degree ) , hardware failure , infection , reoperation . Information surround type complication , duration , management and/or treatment complication record A Data Safety Monitoring Board establish independently monitor trial data . Specific inclusion criterion : - Men woman age 18 year old - Displaced distal femur fracture ( OTA 33A 33C ) see radiograph - Planned treatment use distal femur lock plate - Ability read speak English availability translator willing assist completion study form - Fractures &lt; 14 day post injury - Provision informed consent Specific exclusion criterion : - Open distal femur fracture require flap vascular repair ( grade 3b 3c ) - Planned fixation strategy include interfragmentary lag fixation non-articular fracture - Active local infection - Limited life expectancy due significant medical co-morbidity medical contraindication surgery - Inability comply rehabilitation form completion - Likely problem , judgment investigator , maintain follow-up ( i.e . patient fixed address , patient mentally competent give consent , etc . ) - Non-ambulatory patient - Lack bone substance poor bone quality , surgeon 's judgment , make lock plate fixation impossible - Periprosthetic fracture - Any concomitant lower-extremity injury require non-weight-bearing beyond 6 week post-operative - Addition bone graft , bone graft substitute BMP - Pregnant woman</detailed_description>
