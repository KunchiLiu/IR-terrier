	<brief_summary>Efavirenz essential component HIV treatment child age 3 year old anti-tuberculosis ( anti-TB ) treatment . However , appropriate efavirenz dose anti-TB treatment remain unclear . Rifampin ( anti-TB drug ) increase activity drug metabolize enzyme breakdown efavirenz , may lead low blood level efavirenz treatment failure cotreatment . The drug-to-drug interaction HIV anti-TB drug also vary individual base genetic factor . This study investigate effect anti-TB treatment , well drug-gene interaction blood concentration efavirenz child HIV TB infection . Such data could enhance optimization efavirenz dosage selection alternate regimens child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rifampin Efavirenz Interactions Older Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) prefer regimen child older 3 year rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy . Efavirenz trough plasma concentration 1000 ng/mL associate increase risk virologic failure among HIV-infected adult , concentration 4000 ng/mL associate risk central nervous system side effect . Efavirenz primarily metabolize hepatic CYP2B6 , secondary contribution CYP2A6 . On average , rifampin co-administration cause 26 % reduction efavirenz plasma exposure individual paradoxically elevate efavirenz concentration co-administration adult pharmacokinetic study . The inter-individual variability drug-to-drug interaction suggest efavirenz dose adjustment concomitant anti-TB therapy may necessary patient . In child , limit data pharmacokinetic interaction rifampin-containing TB treatment efavirenz . To knowledge , one publish study child date . Among 15 TB/HIV co-infected child treat standard efavirenz-based active antiretroviral therapy rifampin-containing TB treatment , wide inter-patient variability efavirenz concentration well bimodal distribution efavirenz trough concentration observe . Overall , rifampin-containing anti-TB treatment significant influence mean change efavirenz concentration study population whole , 60 % 53 % child efavirenz trough concentration &lt; 1000 ng/mL anti-TB , respectively . This data suggest current dose efavirenz may suboptimal large proportion child irrespective anti-TB therapy . To overcome risk under-dosing efavirenz especially concurrent anti-TB treatment , WHO recommend prescribe maximum dose weight-band efavirenz coadministered anti-TB treatment . This study seek evaluate whether current dose efavirenz provide adequate efavirenz concentration child , well explore genetic factor influence efavirenz pharmacokinetics concomitant anti-TB treatment . The specific hypothesis test : 1 . At population level , efavirenz plasma concentration TB/HIV co-infected child treat maximized weight-based efavirenz dosage rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy comparable concentration HIV-infected child receive ART without anti-TB treatment . 2 . Co-treatment rifampin- efavirenz-containing therapy lead substantially decrease ( least 40 % ) efavirenz concentration child CYP2B6 extensive intermediate slow metabolizer genotype . A two-arm , well two-period pharmacokinetic study HIV-infected child without TB perform Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital ( KATH ) , Kumasi , Ghana . Eligible participant include child age 3 - 14 year HIV without TB coinfection , ART-na√Øve eligible initiate ART . The ART regimen consist WHO recommend weight-band dosing efavirenz ( 10-13.9kg - 200 mg ; 14-24.9kg - 300mg ; 25-39.9kg - 400 mg &gt; 40Kg - 600 mg ) , plus ZDV 180 - 240 mg/m2 3TC 4 mg/kg twice daily . Tenofovir may use place ZDV . Standard anti-TB therapy prescribe co-infected patient start immediately upon TB diagnosis . A complete medical history , physical examination , stag HIV disease perform initiation ART . Baseline measurement prior initiation ART include CBC , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , LFTs , CD4 cell count determination plasma HIV-1 RNA level . Weeks 12 24 CD4 cell count plasma HIV-1 RNA obtain schedule follow-up . Pharmacokinetic sampling perform week 4 ART arm 4 week anti-TB treatment co-infected group . At sample time , 3 mL blood collect EDTA tube . Blood sample collect time 0 2 , 8 , 12 24 hour post-dose determination efavirenz concentration . Efavirenz concentration plasma measure use HPLC-MS. After sample analysis , data set construct . Anticipated covariates include data set explore include age , sex , weight , relevant drug-metabolizing enzyme genotype , TB therapy status ( on/off ) , CD4 cell count . Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling ( use NONMEM , version VI ) use estimate pharmacokinetic parameter ( CL/F , V/F , AUC , Cmin , Cmax , elimination rate constant ) , inter-individual error , residual error . Results population analysis may use simulate alternative efavirenz dose strategy TB/HIV co-infected population , relevant sub-populations variant PK/pharmacogenetics .</detailed_description>
