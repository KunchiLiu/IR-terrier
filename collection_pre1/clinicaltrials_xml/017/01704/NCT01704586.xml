	<brief_summary>Thyroid nodule common clinical problem . Epidemiologic study show prevalence palpable thyroid nodule approximately 5 % woman 1 % men live iodine-sufficient part world 30 % iodine deficient region , Germany . The clinical importance thyroid nodule rest need exclude thyroid cancer occur 5-15 % . Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) , include papillary follicular cancer , comprise vast majority ( 90 % ) thyroid cancer . In Germany , approximately 7,000 new case diagnosed 2011 . The yearly incidence increase 3.6 per 100,000 1973 8.7 per 100,000 2002 , trend appear continue . Recurrence-free survival generally excellent depends risk group . The role postoperative remnant radioiodine ablation ( RRIA ) serious question regard initial management DTC still need resolve even decade radioiodine use . American Thyroid Association directions future research address question include : - Better understanding long-term risk radioiodine use ; - Improved risk stratification ; Randomized control trial still miss RRIA proven worth safe effective treatment result improved life expectancy reduce recurrence rate . Many observational study lack sufficiently high evidence . Evidence grade rat mainly `` expert level '' , base non-randomized retrospective observation study . Although RRIA Europe establish adjuvant standard treatment patient DTC , except stage T1a , remain show throughout beneficial low risk medium risk patient without metastasis ( M0 ) , also know stage I patient accord UICC/AJCC classification , account 40-90 % patient . Blood dos due cumulative radioiodine therapy may well exceed 2 Gy , RRIA induce average blood dose 0.28 Gy entire body . Risks estimate dose insignificant . The question whether condition remnant ablation justifies increase risk secondary malignancy . The probability causation pharyngeal breast tumour well exceed margin 50 % expose RRIA consecutive I-131 diagnostic imaging explore measureable Tg level . Even though radioiodine therapy benefit patient advance thyroid carcinoma , still unknown whether risk RRIA outweigh discernable benefit . Undoubtedly , quality life may affect adjuvant use I-131 . Study Hypothesis : The I-124 study arm may considerable benefit patient include study . These include - enhance tumour risk stratification , - avoidance unnecessary I-131 exposure 30-89 percent patient classify `` low risk '' tumour ( MACIS AMES score ) `` stage I disease '' ( UICC-AJCC TNM stag system ) , , - improve quality life well morbidity mortality rate I-124 arm . Environmental hospital staff relate benefit include prevention save I-131 exposure . This study design compare effectiveness treatment follow evaluate guideline recommendation two assignment arm .</brief_summary>
