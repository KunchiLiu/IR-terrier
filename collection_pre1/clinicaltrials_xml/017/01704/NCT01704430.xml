	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing heart surgery heart-lung machine ( termed cardiopulmonary bypass ) increase risk abnormal `` inflammation '' body surgery . Such inflammation contribute slow recovery surgery , increase risk infection , increase risk damage organ heart , complicate course . Prior research suggest use oral protein supplement make glutamine ( essential amino acid normally find body ) reduce risk inflammation , infection length stay hospital patient suffer major trauma burn injury . The investigator believe reduce inflammation heart surgery may help promote recovery reduce risk adverse event complication . The purpose preliminary study see oral glutamine supplementation heart surgery practical , contribute reduction inflammation . The oral glutamine propose study base previously study consider safe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glutamine Improve Outcomes Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : We believe early post-operative administration enteral glutamine follow cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) high risk patient reduce inflammation nonscomial infection , reduce length ventilator support , reduce need vasoactive support , reduce secondary organ dysfunction , reduce length hospital stay CVICU , reduce mortality . Objectives : - To assess feasibility early glutamine supplementation - To evaluate safety profile early glutamine supplementation - To evaluate efficacy impact early glutamine clinically important post-operative complication outcome , include : systemic inflammation , nosocomial infection , mortality , health resource utilization Methods : Study Design , Setting , Patient Population : The propose study Phase II , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled trial . This trial perform Cardiovascular Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( CVICU ) Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute ( MAHI ) , Alberta Health Services . The propose trial plan enroll 100 consecutive eligible patient . Inclusion : - Consent ( obtain pre-operatively ) - Adult - age 18 year old ; - Planned cardiac surgery CPB ; - Elevated risk post-operative morbidity , define pre-operative European System Operative Cardiac Risk Evaluation ( EuroSCORE ) &gt; 6 . - Able receive enteral nutrition nasal/oral gastric post-pyloric feeding tube . Exclusion : - Planned heart lung transplantation - Planned cardiac surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass ; - Peri-operative support extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) . Study Protocol : Eligible patient identify pre-operative assessment pre-operative clinic ( PAC ) . All eligible patient surrogate decision-making/legal guardian approach obtain informed write consent . Each consent participant randomly allocate ( 1:1 ) receive post-operative enteral glutamine identical placebo . Investigators , surgeon , intensivists , bedside nurse participant remain blinded study allocation . Glutamine supplementation dose 0.5 g/kg satisfactory body weight ( SBW ) /day divide every 8 hour , start 6 hour post-operatively continue 5 day . The dose 0.5 g/kg SBW/day effective clinical study use enteral glutamine critically ill and/or burn injured major trauma patient . The glutamine supplementation placebo deliver via naso- oro-gastric feeding tube confirmation placement chest X-ray . For participant extubated prior 5 day , enteral glutamine give mouth duration 5 day period . Glutamine placebo mixed orange juice maintain blinding .</detailed_description>
