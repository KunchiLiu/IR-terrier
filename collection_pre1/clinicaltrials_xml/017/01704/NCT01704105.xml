	<detailed_description>Children resource-poor setting risk multiple episode diarrhea , enteric infection , environmental enteropathy , inflammatory disorder intestine compromise nutrient absorption ( 1 ) . In cross-sectional analysis , repeat episode diarrhea chronic environmental enteropathy early childhood associate reduced growth cognitive function , impaired school performance reduce income later life ( 2-8 ) . Although evidence need establish causal link , repeat episode childhood diarrhea enteric infection may exact long-run toll , perpetuate cycle poverty ill health . Infection inadequate diet proximate risk factor undernutrition early life growth falter ; two process likely act reciprocally vicious cycle perpetuate physiologic metabolic deficit increase risk mortality . Children exhibit growth falter likely deficit cognitive development long-term human capital , likely child also suffer growth deficit - perpetuate cycle next generation . There two probable interdependent pathway link enteric infection child growth development . The first pathway include repeat infection lead acute illness parasitic infection first year life , increase risk stunt subsequent cognitive deficit childhood later life . The second pathway subclinical environmental enteropathy . There limited evidence demonstrate whether water quality , sanitation , handwash ( WASH ) intervention improve measure environmental enteropathy , child growth development , whether nutritional intervention could enhance provide concurrently WASH intervention . To help fill evidence gap , WASH Benefits study deliver randomize intervention design reduce infection improve nutrition , measure intervention effect child illness , growth development . WASH Benefits include two , comparable standalone trial Bangladesh Kenya register separate protocol . In Kenya , study include approximately 800 cluster , cluster enroll approximately 10 household compound pregnant woman second third trimester . The study randomize 100 cluster 6 active intervention arm ( water quality , sanitation , handwashing , combine WSH , nutrition , nutrition+WSH ) , 200 cluster double size active control arm , 100 cluster single-sized passive control arm ( measurement pending future funding ) . Children born cohort follow 2 year intervention , measurement 12 24 month intervention delivery . ( anticipated age range : 20 - 27 month old final measurement ) . At 12- 24-month follow-up visit , study collect child anthropometric measurement caregiver-reported diarrhea . In final visit study administer test measure child development outcomes . The study collect urine , blood , stool specimen subsample 1,500 child distribute across four arm study ( Active Control , Combined WSH , Nutrition , Nutrition+WSH ) measure biomarkers gut function intestinal parasitic infection 12- 24-month follow-up visit . In addition , study collect specimen ( blood , stool ) child 18 - 27 month old baseline living compound target child test intestinal parasitic infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study Population Description : The subject population young child mothers/guardians live several contiguous district Western Province , rural area outside town Bungoma Kakamega . Communities must meet following criterion : Located rural area ( define village &lt; 25 % resident live rental house , &lt; 2 gas/petrol station &lt; 10 shop ) Not enrol ongoing WASH nutrition program No chlorine dispenser water source instal program separate present study Majority ( &gt; 80 % ) households access pip water home At least six eligible pregnant woman cluster baseline . From enrolled community , household compound enrol meet follow criterion . 1 . One woman selfidentify pregnant time baseline survey 2 . The woman plan stay community next 12 month . ( 1 ) The study exclude household home help mitigate attrition followup .</criteria>
