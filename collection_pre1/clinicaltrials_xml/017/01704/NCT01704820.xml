	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy gold standard screen test colorectal cancer . Removal pre-malignant colon polyp colonoscopy reduces colorectal cancer mortality 50 % . However , colonoscopy highly effective prevent distal ( leave side ) colon cancer , provide limited protection cancer proximal ( right side ) colon . Our goal determine additional pre-cancerous colon polyp identify look right side colon retroflexion . During retroflexion tip colonoscope turn 180 degree ; allow doctor view back colonic fold . If additional polyp identify manner colonoscopy become efficient method screen colon cancer . In order evaluate effective right colon retroflexion detect polyp proximal colon plan perform randomize , control trial . Patients undergo screen follow colonoscopy invite participate study . Those patient agree participate randomize one two group colonoscope fully insert . Group one right side colon examine polyp endoscope look forward ( traditional form examination ) follow repeat examination right side colon colonosocpe retroflexion ( look backwards ) . Polyps see section exam remove manner polyp found/ remove record . Following two exam right side colon colonoscopy complete usual manner . The duration portion colonoscopy record . After procedure complete physician perform colonoscopy rate difficulty procedure confidence quality examination . Pathology result polyp record available . There study relate follow pathology result record .</brief_summary>
