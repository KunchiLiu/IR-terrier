	<brief_title>Dexmedetomidine 's Cardiac Cognitive Influence Patients Undergoing Off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( OPCAB ) procedure bring new challenge anesthesiologist urge u contemplate choice anesthetic . In face challenge Dexmedetomdine multiple unique trait readily fit situation . Off-pump coronary artery bypass ( OPCAB ) procedure emerge procedure might bring benefit patient comparison conventional CABGs although final word outcomes n't reach basis recent literature . However , OPCAB technique definitely require involvement anesthesiologist especially case hemodynamic compromise usually inevitable anastomosis Lcx PDA early extubation OR expected1 . Thus , investigator encounter intraoperative challenge cause OPCAB routine CABGs . Concerning challenge investigator might take , investigator shall pay attention surgeon ' manipulation also review anesthetic investigator select find optimal plan minimize adverse effect heart important organ . With perspective , dexmedetomidine come sight peculiar trait hemodynamic effect assume cardiac protective effect . Dexmedetomidine selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine gradually gain popularity anesthetic ICU setting unique pharmacologic characteristic . Dexmedetomidine provide sufficient sedative effect minimal respiratory effect reduce consumption sedative antinociceptive drugs.Given specific requirement OPCAB surgery , dexmedetomidine 's may suitable vary aspect . Firstly , dexmedetomine dramatically diminish level serum catecholamine ( CA ) . As investigator know , diminish level catecholamine indicate less stress response surgical stimulus low incidence cardiac event . Secondly , relatively slow HR dexmedetomidine decrease oxygen consumption myocardium consequently improve perfusion endanger ischemic area . In addition , decrease HR assumably analogous effect esmolol β-blockers reduce occurrence tachycardia minimize motion heart `` bypass '' procedure perform target vessel . Thirdly , report dexmedetomidine alleviate suffering renal function major thoracic surgery .Thus , imply dexmedetomidine might similar way ameliorate damage renal system cause hour stress response havoc SIRS , improve clinical prognosis . In view assumption investigator propose ground dexmedetomidine 's characteristic specific requirement OPCAB surgery , investigator expect dexmdetomidine fit situation patient ' limited capacity coronary artery sophisticated pathophysiological course take account .</detailed_description>
