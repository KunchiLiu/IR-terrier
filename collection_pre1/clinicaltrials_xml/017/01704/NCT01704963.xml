	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase ( Btk ) Inhibitor PCI-32765 Patients With Recurrent Mature B-Cell Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , dose escalation study . The study consist 3 phase , include , screen phase ( within 14 day prior first study medication ) , treatment phase , follow phase . In treatment phase , patient recurrent mature B-cell neoplasm divide 2 cohort : Cohort 1 ( consist 3 12 patient ) , Cohort 2 ( consist 6 12 patient ) . Cohort 1 divide 2 phase : single dose ( SD ) phase multiple dose ( MD ) phase . During initial SD phase , patient first receive single dose PCI-32765 140 mg. After washout period ( period participant receive study medication ) 72 168 hour , patient receive second single dose PCI-32765 280 mg . Following second washout period , patient enter MD phase , receive PCI-32765 multiple dos 420 mg per day 35 day first cycle ( 35 day Cycle 1 ) 28 day second cycle ( 28 day Cycle 2 ) every cycle thereafter . In cohort 2 , patient receive multiple dos 560 mg per day 35 day Cycle 1 , 28 day Cycle 2 , every cycle thereafter . The patient 's registration Cohort 2 start tolerability Cohort 1 confirm . Tolerability dose level evaluate base dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) occurrence rate Cycle 1 Cohort . Following tolerability 420 mg/day dose level subject mature B-cell neoplasm confirm Cohort 1 , CLL/SLL Cohort add evaluate safety tolerability dose specific population Japanese since 420 mg/day globally recommend dose subject CLL SLL , specific disease entity within mature B-cell neoplasm . Between 6 12 subject enrol CLL/SLL Cohort receive continuous dose PCI-32765 420 mg/day 35 day Cycle 1 28 day Cycle 2 thereafter . Safety evaluation adverse event , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram , vital sign , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status , physical examination , corneal eye examination monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
