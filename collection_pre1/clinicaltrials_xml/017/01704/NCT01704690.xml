	<brief_title>Combination Treatment S-1 With Paclitaxel Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer one common malignant tumor , especially China annual incidence esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 260,000 motility 210,000 . In western country , incidence esophageal adenocarcinoma ( esophageal - gastric junction carcinoma ) dramatically increase past . The pathological type high incidence change esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma , ESCC ) esophageal adenocarcinoma ( Esophageal adenocarcinoma , EAC ) whose incidence 60-70 % . But Asia , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma still dominant pathological type , account 95 % . The prognosis esophageal cancer poor . About 50 % patient advanced disease diagnosis natural course 6-8 month 5-year survival rate 5-7 % . In addition , though patient received surgical treatment , disease recurrent metastasis nearly 90 % patient . For patient early stage ( T1 ) , still nearly 50 % patient relapse within 5 year . Therefore , recent year , doctor researcher different country continue seek effective treatment improve quality life patient esophageal cancer prolong survival . In past decade , n't much improvement outcome survival advance esophageal cancer due lack effective chemotherapy agent . The traditional chemotherapy drug treat esophageal cancer include 5 - fluorouracil cisplatin combination result 25-35 % response rate first-line palliative treatment . And comb still traditional chemotherapy regimen wildly use clinical study treat esophageal gland , squamous cell carcinoma clinical study . Paclitaxel plus cisplatin regiment another promising treatment esophageal cancer prove effective lot study . This combination become standard treatment esophageal cancer , especially esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . In one previous study , paclitaxel cisplatin treatment show encouraging clinical result manageable side-effects 131 patient advanced esophageal cancer . These investigation fully prove efficacy feasibility combination paclitaxel cisplatin regiment treatment esophageal cancer . However , low solubility paclitaxel limit direct intravenous use . To solve problem , paclitaxel must inject addition surfactant polyoxyethylene castor oil . Polyoxyethylene castor oil paclitaxel could induce high incidence acute hypersensitivity reaction , ie . severe allergic reaction , kidney damage , neurotoxicity cardiovascular toxicity characterize axonal degeneration demyelination . Though proper preventive treatment greatly reduce incidence allergy , still small number patient allergy reaction . As investigator know , main adverse cisplatin renal toxicity . The peak age esophageal cancer patient age 65 70 many simultaneously diseases hypertension , diabetes , chronic kidney disease cause vary damage renal function limit use cisplatin patient . Therefore , urgent crucial doctor seek alternative cisplatin combination chemotherapy treatment . There n't well design large scale clinical trial evidence non-platinum treatment esophageal cancer . Therefore , investigator design randomized clinical trial novel combination S-1 paclitaxel use treat advanced esophageal cancer patient compare paclitaxel/cisplatin 5-FU/cisplatin treatment explore efficacy toxicity . The investigator hope study provide clue treatment esophageal cancer patient .</detailed_description>
