	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety And Efficacy Transradial Coronary Comparison With Transfemoral Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , perform PCI require make access peripheral artery arterial puncture cut . This may lead serious bleed complication especially situation dual antiplatelet therapy and/or potent anti-coagulation therapy . TRI widely accept promising alternative TFI around world . It suppose reduce incidence serious bleed complication PCI , well total medical cost . There several prospective randomize trial compare safety efficacy TRI TFI , none enough power show statistically valid equivalence efficacy TRI TFI . In study , investigator randomize approximately 1,700 patient TRI TFI . Investigators adopt rate major adverse cardiac event ( MACCE ) 1 year primary efficacy endpoint study . Based rate 1 year , sample size non-inferiority analysis primary efficacy endpoint calculate . Through randomization trial , investigator achieve scientific evidence improve safety equal efficacy TRI compare TFI . This trial enough statistical power draw final conclusion debate TRI TFI .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient must least 18 year age . Patient able verbally acknowledge understand associate risk , benefit treatment alternative legally authorize representative provide sign informed consent prior randomization , approve appropriate IEC . Patient must evidence myocardial ischemia ( e.g. , stable unstable angina , silent ischemia , positive functional study reversible change electrocardiogram ( ECG ) consistent ischemia ) . Patient must acceptable candidate coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . Allen test require suitable candidate . Patient must agree undergo protocolrequired followup examination . Patient must agree participate clinical study within duration trial . Target lesion must able treat use sixFrench guide catheter . Target lesion de Novo restenotic . The target lesion stable unstable . Patient receive heart transplant organ transplant wait list organ transplant . Patient receive schedule receive chemotherapy malignancy within 30 day prior procedure . Patient receive immunosuppression therapy know immunosuppressive autoimmune disease ( e.g . Human Immunodeficiency Virus , Lupus etc. ) . Patient extensive peripheral vascular disease precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion . Patient medical illness ( e.g. , cancer congestive heart failure ) may cause noncompliance protocol , confound data interpretation associate limited life expectancy ( i.e. , less one year ) . Female patient childbearing potential refuse urine blood pregnancy test ( do within 7 day prior index procedure ) , patient nurse time index procedure patient agree time consent use approve form birth control include followup 1 year . The target lesion consider treat use sixFrench guide catheter .</criteria>
