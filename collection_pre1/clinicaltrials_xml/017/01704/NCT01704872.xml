	<brief_title>ch14.18/CHO Bridging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-ganglioside GD2 antibody ch14.18 monoclonal antibody specifically recognize target antigen GD2 , express virtually neuroblastoma tumour . This antibody chimeric protein consist 30 % mouse variable light heavy chain 70 % human constant heavy light chain . Ch 14.18 already test stage 4 neuroblastoma patient phase I/II clinical trial encourage response rate . Therefore , European SIOP neuroblastoma group design Phase III protocol test efficacy ch14.18 immunotherapy randomise trial . However , ch14.18 antibody Phase III trial recloned produce Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell contrast ch14.18 antibody use previous clinical trial , produce murine , non-secreting myeloma cell ( SP2/0 ) . Although antibody-gene transfer CHO SP2/0 do exactly plasmid assure identical protein sequence , change glycosylation final protein product may occur since glycosylation pattern varies different production cell line . Glycosylation important immunological effector function antibody pharmacokinetics patient . Therefore , change consider major change production require reassessment new product Phase I clinical trial . The primary objective trial re-evaluation toxicity new ch14.18/CHO antibody . This ultimately followed secondary objective include determination pharmacokinetics immunostimulation patient receive ch14.18/CHO therapy . This involve particularly determination activation immune effector cell complement application ch14.18/CHO . Subsequently , evaluate clinical effect treatment course disease . The nature phase I trial bridge study medicinal product subject major change production accord guideline provide `` Committee Proprietary Medicinal Products '' ( CPMP ) `` European Agency Evaluation Medicinal Products ( EMEA ) ( Document Number CPMP/BWP/3207/00 ) .</detailed_description>
