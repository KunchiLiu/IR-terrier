	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer commonly diagnose cancer men Canada . Over 30 % men age fifty histological evidence prostate cancer biopsy . Despite stage migration afford early detection serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) test apparent trend toward improved survival past several year , prostate cancer remain significant cause morbidity mortality . Biochemical failure primary therapy ( surgery radiation ) remain significant health care burden strategy delay clinical prostate cancer progression prolong interval treatment failure systemic therapy would significant clinical benefit men suffer find PSA recurrence . PSA widely accept useful prognostic marker prostate cancer progression , particularly primary therapy radical surgery radiation . 5 Despite improved cancer control rate definitive management early stage prostate cancer , PSA recurrence unfortunately common occurrence ( 25-50 % ) large case series . Microenvironmental factor demonstrate play pivotal role selection neoplastic cell subpopulation express malignant phenotype contribute progression localize metastatic disease . Very low level O2 ( &lt; 10 mmHg ) well describe many solid tumour ( include prostate cancer ) extent hypoxia demonstrate represent independent marker poor prognosis patient various type cancer . Tumour hypoxia contribute numerous adaptive phenotype include increased invasion metastasis , well evasion immune cell surveillance increase resistance radiotherapy chemotherapy . Although cellular adaptive response hypoxia likely mediate various mechanism , previous preclinical study suggest decrease nitric oxide ( NO ) -dependent signal play significant role progression malignant phenotype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Researcher 's pre-clinical research demonstrate hypoxia-induced tumor cell invasiveness , metastatic ability , resistance chemotherapeutic agent evasion immune cell recognition inhibit molecule activate NO signal pathway involve cGMP generation ( glyceryl trinitrate , GTN ) , pharmacological inhibition NO signalling result phenotypes similar induced exposure hypoxia . Based pre-clinical data describe researcher recently complete published phase 2 trial patient recurrent prostate cancer use low-dose , sustained release trasndermal patch GTN . The GTN supply Minitranâ„¢ ( nitroglycerin ) transdermal delivery system ( 3M Company , St. Paul , Minnesota ) open label , non-blinded fashion . GTN nitrodonor use management angina 100 year well-documented safety tolerability record never associate carcinogenesis . Their pre-clinical study demonstrate low molar concentration nitric oxide donor require attenuate hypoxia-induced malignant phenotype . Our result suggest significant inhibition progressive disease give effect PSA doubling time GTN treatment compare doubling time prior initiate trial . Within 12 month trial , 17 24 patient double time slow category even stable/declining PSA level . The mean doubling time entire cohort increase 31.8 month 13.2 month prior start treatment . When compare match control group patient PSA recurrence receive treatment , similar significant difference PSA doubling time observe . There adverse effect report trial . This first report clinical use nitric oxide donor treatment prostate cancer . The role nitric oxide malignant progression subject controversy , study show either tumor-promoting tumor-inhibitory role . These apparently contradictory effect NO may explain fact molecule regulate phenotype variety mechanism depend local concentration redox state cell . Based previous finding , investigator propose observed effect GTN PSA patient cohort relate 'low concentration ' effect NO . The investigator identify several possible beneficial mechanism effect low-dose NO donor cancer management . We recently publish positive effect effect NO signalling ( GTN effector molecule ) cancer immune surveillance . The major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related ( MIC ) molecule , MICA MICB , play important role tumor surveillance NK cell , lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cell , cytotoxic T cell . While MICA absent normal tissue , induce cellular stress , exposure carcinogen infection , express broad range carcinoma haematopoietic malignancy . In human , interaction cell surface MIC molecules C-type lectin-like NKG2D receptor NK , LAK effector T cell lead activation innate adaptive immune response subsequent lysis tumor cell . Thus , propose MIC-NKG2D interaction critical immune surveillance function NK , LAK cytotoxic T cell . The investigator show hypoxia contributes tumor cell shed MIC mechanism involve impaired nitric oxide ( NO ) signal . While hypoxia increase MIC shed human prostate cancer cell , activation NO signalling inhibit hypoxia-mediated MIC shedding . Similar incubation hypoxia , pharmacological inhibition endogenous NO signalling increase MIC shed . These finding suggest hypoxic tumor microenvironment contributes impair immune surveillance activation NO signal potential use cancer immunotherapy . Based previous study investigator 's hypothesis low-dose transdermal GTN positive effect cancer immune surveillance may translate therapeutic benefit . In order establish proof-of-concept , propose initiate correlative study describe protocol , determine effect GTN treatment biomarkers immune activity patient prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
