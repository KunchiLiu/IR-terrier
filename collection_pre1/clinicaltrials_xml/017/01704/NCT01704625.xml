The sham group receive 3 sham treatment . The patient consent form information whether patient receive osteopathic manipulative treatment keep lock file . The information transfer password-protected computer file . After standardized treatment sham treatment perform , resident leave patient provide physician ask patient draw vertical line VAS rate pain .
