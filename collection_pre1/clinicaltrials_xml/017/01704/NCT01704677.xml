	<brief_summary>During past 25-30 year , surgery total disc replacement ( TDR ) become option selection patient chronic low back pain ( LBP ) traditionally treat conservatively operated spinal fusion . Randomized trial compare TDR fusion find clinical outcome TDR least equivalent fusion , study compare TDR non-surgical treatment ( The Norwegian TDR study ) conclude TDR significantly effective multidisciplinary rehabilitation ( REHAB ) 2 year . However , long-term effect TDR term clinical result , cost , reoperation- revision rate , degenerative change prognostic factor investigate high quality prospective trial . This much require since TDR surgery offer great number patient world wide , associated high complexity risk serious complication difficult revision . Hence , overall aim present study evaluate long term ( eight year follow-up ) effect The Norwegian TDR study TDR surgery compare modern multidisciplinary rehabilitation patient chronic low back pain localize degenerative disc change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lumbar Disc Prosthesis Versus Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation ; 8-year Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two-year result Norwegian TDR study publish BMJ May 2011 ( Hellum et al ) . The current protocol 8-year follow-up patient include Norwegian TDR study . Hypothesis 8-year follow-up : Main hypothesis ( H0 ) : There difference change TDR REHAB pain disability measure Oswestry Disability Index ( main outcome ) , back pain , quality life , psychological variable , work status , patient satisfaction , drug use , urinary incontinence , back surgeries 8 year . Secondary Hypothesis : 1 . There difference incidence degree disc degeneration adjacent level facet joint degeneration index level group ( radiological analysis ) . 2 . There association baseline characteristic , pelvic anatomy / sagittal balance ( defined lumbar lordosis , pelvic tilt , pelvic incidence angle sacral slope ) , clinical outcome TDR . 3 . There difference cost effectiveness surgery REHAB 8 year inclusion study . Statistical analysis : The investigator use analysis 2-years result : two-way ANOVA , mixed model , regression analysis . p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant Additional analysis ( conduct 2 year ) : 1. cross-overs receive last value cross-over/fusion surgery 2. survival analysis 3. pelvic anatomy / sagittal balance ( defined lumbar lordosis , pelvic tilt , pelvic incidence angle sacral slope ) include predictor analysis 4 . Both CT scan MRI take evaluation index level facet arthropathy</detailed_description>

The following degenerative change evaluate : least 40 % reduction disc height , Modic change type I and/or II , highintensity zone disc , morphological change classify change signal intensity disc grade 3 4 . The disc classify degenerative first criterion alone least two change find magnetic resonance imaging . The disc independently classify two observer ( orthopaedic surgeon /radiologist ) . When disagreement , image classify third observer outcome decide simple majority . Generalized chronic pain syndrome ( widespread myofascial pain ) Degeneration establish two level . To classify normal disc , disc height must reduce 40 % criterion degenerative disc disease aforementioned must absent . The classification normal disc perform two independent observer .
