	<brief_summary>This study do compare survival use pembrolizumab ( SCH 900475 , MK-3475 ) standard chemotherapy participant advance melanoma ( MEL ) progress prior therapy . Participants initially randomize receive either low dose pembrolizumab , high dose pembrolizumab Investigator-choice chemotherapy ( ICC ) . The randomization either pembrolizumab Investigator choice chemotherapy conduct open-label fashion . The pembrolizumab dose initially blind Investigators participant Amendment 03 . With Amendment 03 , ongoing pembrolizumab participant treat open-label , fix dose pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 week ( Q3W ) , instead weight-based dose pembrolizumab . The four standard chemotherapy choice carboplatin + paclitaxel , paclitaxel alone , dacarbazine , temozolomide . Participants standard chemotherapy experience disease progression may eligible crossover treatment pembrolizumab provide meet protocol-specified requirement crossover . With Amendment 03 , crossover participant treat open-label , fix dose pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W instead weight-based dose pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>
