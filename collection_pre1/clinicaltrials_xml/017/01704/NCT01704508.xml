	<brief_title>Improving Anti-malarial Treatment Options Guinea-Bissau - Part A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Plasmodium falciparum cause malaria approximately 665 000 death year . Previously chloroquine ( CQ ) sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine principle drug treatment malaria . Due widespread resistance drugs1 , World Health Organization recommend P. falciparum Africa treat artemisinin + amodiaquine , artemether + lumefantrine ( AL ) dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine2 ( DP ) . However , resistance artemisinins appear developing3,4 , resistance amodiaquine exists2 treatment AL rapidly select parasite increase tolerance ( 5 time higher inhibitory concentration ) lumefantrine5-7 . In Guinea-Bissau , CQ remain efficacious replace AL . This explain use unique well tolerate high dose treatment schedule 8-10 . Since introduction AL 2008 , number child malaria increase manyfold Bissau contrast African country . Our data suggest increase due unavailability AL , poorer expect effectiveness AL increase use second-line drug quinine . Quinine typically give 3 instead 7 day poor efficacy use thus11 . To counter Guinea-Bissau need alternative cheap easily dose 2nd line drug also use AL available funding AL long exists . Dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine safe well tolerate artemisinin base combination12 . DP take daily show highly efficacious ( &gt; 95 % ) several African settings13,14 . DP also protect re-infection longer AL14 . As drug could become attractive treatment option Guinea-Bissau . It however , never use country . Aim Conduct efficacy study artemether + lumefantrine dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine 1 . To measure efficacy safety AL DP child age 6 month 12 year suffer uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . 2 . To determine capacity drug combination protect re-infection . 3 . To differentiate recrudescence re-infections use PCR base method 4 . To determine whole blood concentration lumefantrine piperaquine week reparasitaemia 5 . To determine haemoglobin value day 0 , 3 42 6 . To determine differential white blood cell count day 0 , 3 , 7 , 14 21 7 . To determine genetic polymorphism P. falciparum cause reparasitaemia , 8 . To culture parasites 50 child characterisation P. falciparum geno- phenotype . 2 . Methods Study design This open label , randomize , non inferiority trial conduct Bandim health centre , Guinea-Bissau . Children uncomplicated malaria meet study inclusion criterion enrol , randomise treatment either AL DP , treat site monitor 42 day . The follow consist fix schedule check-up visit correspond clinical laboratory examination . The proportion child experience therapeutic failure follow-up period use estimate efficacy study drug . PCR analysis use distinguish true recrudescence due treatment failure episodes re-infection . Study Site population Children age 6 month 12 year uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria attend Bandim health centre . Timing duration study The study start November 2012 continue 350 child include . If achieve one year study run 2 year . Inclusion criteria A ) Age ≥6 month , &lt; 13 year . B ) Mono-infection P. falciparum detect microscopy . C ) Parasitemia 1.000-200.000/µl asexual form . D ) Axillary temperature ≥37.5 ˚C history fever within 24 hour . E ) Ability swallow oral medication . F ) Ability willingness comply study protocol duration study comply study visit schedule . G ) Informed consent parent guardian Exclusion criterion A ) Signs symptom severe malaria include follow symptoms Prostration . Impaired consciousness . Respiratory distress . Repeated generalised convulsion ( three per 24 hour 2 witness seizure 24 hour ) . Circulatory collapse . Abnormal bleeding . Jaundice . Haemoglobinuria ( dark red/black urine ) . Severe anaemia ( Haemoglobin &lt; 5g/dl ) . Hyperparasitaemia ( &gt; 200.000/ µl asexual form ) B ) Presence general danger sign child 5 include follow Prostration . Respiratory distress . Haemoglobin &lt; 5g/dl . Two convulsion within 24 hour . Persistent vomit C ) Presence severe malnutrition . D ) Any evidence chronic disease acute infection malaria . E ) Regular medication may interfere antimalarial pharmacokinetics . F ) History hypersensitivity reaction contraindication AL , DP quinine . G ) Domicile outside study area . Loss follow If child see day follow child seek home two consecutive day possible contacted mobile phone . At subsequent weekly follow three new attempt see child make . 3 . Treatment Antimalarial treatment Treatment AL give accord 6-dose regime . Treatment DP give accord 3 dose regime . Tablets AL ( 20 mg artemether 120 mg lumefantrine ) obtain manufacturer . Tablets DP ( Eurartesim® ) 160mg/20mg 320mg/40mg obtain Sigma-Tau . Block Randomization Identical slip paper specify treatment arm AL DP put envelope . Each envelope contain 20 slip group child randomly select one slip . Concomitant treatment medication use Paracetamol use treat fever . Iron vitamin supplementation give require . Prior treatment antimalarial drug consider exclusion criterion . Children take drug antimalarial activity ( include antibiotic tetracycline azithromycin ) study period withdrawn . Rescue treatment If child vomit twice , receive therapy quinine intramuscularly withdrawn study . Any child sign severe complicate malaria treat accord recommendation attend nurse . If child meet criteria early treatment failure , receive parenteral quinine . If child meet criteria late treatment failure re-treated AL . 4 . Evaluation Criteria Efficacy safety evaluation Treatment outcomes early treatment failure , late clinical failure , late parasitological failure adequate clinical parasitological response define WHO2 . Safety end point The incidence adverse event include neutropenia document . All child ask routinely previous symptom symptom emerge since previous follow visit . When clinically indicate , child evaluate treat appropriately . All adverse event record case record form . Clinical evaluation All child evaluate attend study nurse examination include physical examination , body weight , body ( axillary ) temperature show table 3 Microscopic examination Two thick thin blood film parasite count specie identification obtain show table 3 whenever child return Bandim health centre . Slides stain use freshly prepared Giemsa examine 1000 x magnification . The number asexual parasite per 200 white blood cell count , parasitaemia high , number white blood cell per 500 parasite count . Parasite density assess independently 2 qualified microscopist . Discordant result read third time . Genotyping , antimalarial drug concentration , haemoglobin white blood cell count 100µL blood collect Whatman 3MM filter-paper use capillary tube day 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 whenever reparasitaemia detect . Filter-papers dry place inside separate seal plastic bag . Filter-papers bag label study number date follow day . The sample store -20˚C . Blood sample obtain time blood take microscopy . In order differentiate recrudescence re-infection genotyping use sequential analysis pfglurp , pfmsp1 pfmsp2 done21 . The proportion resistance associate genotype resistance associate gene include pfcrt , pfmdr1 , pfmrp1 pfcmu determine . Genotyping do Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden and/or Universidade Minho , Portugal . Drug concentration assess week prior reparasitaemia Mahidol University Bangkok use high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . Haemoglobin concentration determine day 0 , 3 42 use haemocueTM At time blood sample microscopy do Day 0 , exactly 200μL blood also take vitro culture 50 patient . The blood put medium grown vitro incubator 37 ˚C . When culture establish frozen liquid nitrogen transport Sweden Portugal extensive drug assay carry . 5 . Study Assessment Screening enrolment As part routine medical service provide health centre , child symptoms suggestive malaria screen malaria use rapid diagnostic test . Positive test confirm microscopy . Children fulfil inclusion critera invite participate study follow informed consent . Follow Children give unique personal identification number give treatment informed consent . The basic follow schedule show .
