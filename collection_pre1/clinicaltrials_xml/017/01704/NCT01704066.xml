	<brief_summary>The original American-European Consensus Conference ( AECC ) definition Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) require bilateral infiltrates consistent pulmonary edema frontal chest X-ray ( CXR ) , poor inter-observer reliability interpret CXR use definition among intensivists radiologist . As result , newly publish Berlin definition ARDS specify CXR criterion include bilateral opacity consistent pulmonary edema fully explain effusion , lobar/lung collapse , nodules/masses CXR . In order improve inter-observer agreement , panel also develop set CXRs judged consistent , inconsistent , equivocal diagnosis ARDS . The objective study investigate impact training set inter-observer reliability apply radiographic definition ARDS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study compose 3 phase : Phase 1 : All participant require independently interpret set 12 CXRs , provide consensus panel . The possible radiographic interpretation include consistent , inconsistent , equivocal diagnosis ARDS . Phase 2 : Training material adapt accord recently publish Berlin definition ARDS , expand rationale interpretation 12 CXRs , send participant . Phase 3 : The set 12 CXRs , different order , send participant interpretation second time .</detailed_description>
