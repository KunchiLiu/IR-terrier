	<brief_title>SR-WBV Training Frail Elderly Skilling Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study base guideline fall management exercise program ( FaME ; Skelton Dinan ) . The goal : Skilling : improvement neuromuscular control , postural control strengthen large muscle group low extremity . Training Gain : improvement functional ability . Maintaining Gains : muscle growth , improvement bone density multi-sensory exercise . First , pilot study conduct untrained elderly ( `` Effects stochastic resonance therapy postural control elderly population '' ( KEK Bern : No.228/09 , Clinical Trial Registry : NCT01045746 ) . Following , second pilot study conduct frail elderly ( Application Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance Frail Elderly : The Effects Postural Control Clinical Trial Registry : NCT01543243 ) . It find select chosen form recruitment ( presentation advertisement ) measurement method suitable untrained elderly . But frail elderly choose form recruitment measurement method sufficient . For study , measurement parameter functional performance strength use . Goals study skilling phase : 1 . Feasibility 2 . Study effect physical functional performance 3 . Study effect muscle strength . The participant recruit Canton Bern - Swizerland randomly allocate intervention group sham group .</detailed_description>
