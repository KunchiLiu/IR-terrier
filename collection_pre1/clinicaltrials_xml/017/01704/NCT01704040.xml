	<detailed_description>This two-part , randomize ( participant assign treatment chance ) , double-blind ( participant investigator know study agent administer ) , placebo-controlled study . A placebo appear identical study agent , active ingredient , help investigator evaluate effect study agent . In Part 1 , follow administration CNTO 3157 placebo , severity upper respiratory tract infection , due inoculation HRV 16 , assess healthy participant safety reason . In Part 2 , follow administration CNTO 3157 placebo inoculation HRV-16 , efficacy safety assess asthmatic participant use standard assessment evaluate asthma treatment . The study ( Parts 1 2 ) complete last participant completes last visit ( Week 11 ) Part 2 .</detailed_description>
