	<brief_summary>Patients end-stage renal failure require dialysis remove toxins blood . Haemodialysis best provide native arterio-venous fistula ( AVF ) . Creation AVF require short ( ~1hr ) surgical procedure join artery vein together . There limited potential site fistula creation . Generally preferrable utilise distal site wrist first , proximal elbow procedure preclude subsequent use wrist initial fistula fail . The small diameter artery vein wrist require precise surgical technique . There two potential technique common use create arterio-venous anastomosis ( join artery vein ) - continuous suture interrupted suture . Whilst theoretical advantage interrupt technique , uncertain translate clinically well success create fistula . The aim study therefore compare clinical success two technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Interrupted v Continuous Suturing Techniques Radiocephalic Fistulae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The micro-vascular anastamosis require creation radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula , technically challenge surgery . Primary patency rate radiocephalic fistula vary 50-75 % literature 60-95 % within department . It important optimise primary patency rate initial failure subject patient risk surgery often necessiates commence dialysis via tunnelled line ( less effective associate increased risk infection ) whilst second attempt create fistula undertaken . Multiple variation continuous interrupted suture technique describe vascular literature , animal model arterio-venous fistulae clinical study speciality . However study compare two technique within clinical practice . Evidence vivo animal study variable . Several author show difference primary patency rate achieve continuous suture versus interrupted suture technique use anastomosis ( Chen &amp; Chen , 2001 ; Wilasrusmee et al 2007 ) . Others suggest use continuous suture cause reduced cross-sectional area anastomosis compare interrupt technique ( Tozzi &amp; Hayoz , 2001 ) . Similarly interrupted suture technique permit expansion vessel physiological pressure continuous technique ( Norbert &amp; Philip , 1996 ; Gerdisch &amp; Hinkamp , 2003 ) . This loss compliance anastomosis turn lead intimal hyperplasia , cause poor blood flow failure anastamosis ( Dorbin , 1994 ) , indicate potential theoretical benefit interrupt suture . There clinical study compare two technique variation practice varies considerably . The aim study therefore compare patency rate radiocephalic fistulae randomise one anastomotic technique .</detailed_description>
