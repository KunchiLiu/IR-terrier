	<brief_summary>Open elective abdominal aortic surgery high risk procedure involve clamp aorta . Indications include abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) aortic occlusive disease ( AOD ) cause low limb ischaemia . These patient often regard one entity postoperative study setting . However , previous study indicate risk profile , inflammatory activity , haemodynamic capacity may differ group . The first aim study evaluate postoperative ICU-requirements open elective abdominal aortic surgery , hypothesise AAA-patients longer ICU-stays need mechanical ventilation acute dialysis patient AOD . The investigator see relatively high incidence postoperative acute kidney injury ( AKI ) follow aortic surgery . Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalcin ( NGAL ) may useful early diagnosis postopeative AKI . However , NGAL also know marker inflammatory activation . The ischaemia-reperfusion injury subsequent inflammatory response aortic cross clamping may per se induce rise NGAL despite intact renal function . Therefore NGAL may reliable marker AKI AAS . The second aim study describe change NGAL AAS patient without postoperative dialysis-dependent AKI .</brief_summary>
