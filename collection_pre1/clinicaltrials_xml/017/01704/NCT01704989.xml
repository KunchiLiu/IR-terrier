	<brief_summary>A number large clinical trial find pseudoexfoliation ( PXF ) major risk factor glaucoma progression risk blindness . It estimate PXF account approximately quarter case open angle glaucoma Nova Scotia , Canada , make region ideal set study patient condition . Despite associated high morbidity , treatment pseudoexfoliative glaucoma remain suboptimal challenge clinician . Topical medical therapy less effective primary open angle glaucoma patient often require early surgical therapy , associate risk . Selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) may safe effective treatment pseudoexfoliative glaucoma , although evidence presently lack . The aim current study provide first controlled-trial evidence effectiveness SLT , compare topical therapy , management pseudoexfoliative glaucoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary aim study compare effectiveness , term intraocular pressure ( IOP ) control , SLT topical medical therapy primary treatment patient high IOP secondary PXF . The secondary aim study : 1 . To examine relationship degree angle pigmentation reduction IOP 2 . To examine adverse effect SLT treatment patient PXF 3 . To compare IOP-lowering effect SLT patient PXF patient POAG ( LiGHT study , see structure ) . Study Population : All new patient PXF na√Øve treatment ( willing participate ) recruit first hospital consultation . Both eye treat one eye per patient include analysis ( eye high present IOP ) . Structure : The study design mirror National Institute Health ( NIHR- ) fund , laser glaucoma ocular hypertension trial ( LiGHT ) UK collaborative study Canadian Institute Moorfields Eye Hospital London . This single-study randomise ( unmasked ) control trial propose treatment intervention ( SLT ) versus standard treatment ( topical therapy ) . Summary study design Patients randomise one 2 trial arm : 'laser-pathway ' 'medicine- pathway ' . Following initial treatment , SLT patient follow 1-2 week treatment check IOP potential side effect . The interval subsequent follow-up visit ( 4 12 month ) govern level IOP relation target IOP severity glaucoma . Visual field test ( SITA standard , 24-2 test pattern ) image Hedidelberg Retina Tomograph ( HRT III ) perform visit . Target IOP set use Canadian Glaucoma Society guideline depend severity glaucoma level IOP . At subsequent visit , treatment escalate target IOP meet evidence progression . Duration study The study last 3 year . One year allow recruitment study participant , minimum follow-up 2 year available . All patient medical history , gonioscopy , central corneal thickness ( CCT ) measurement , IOP measurement Goldmann applanation tonometry dilate fundoscopy baseline visit .</detailed_description>
