	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluating Treatment Knee Osteoarthritis With Cryo-Touch III Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 100 million patient United States suffer chronic pain . Chronic pain condition often debilitate , take toll patient 's physical mental welfare . Though variety pain management technique currently exist , common nonsurgical option provide slow-acting and/or short-term relief . Medication , often form non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) opioids , come array side effect nausea vomit . Medication also present possibility serious effect increase risk heart attack stroke , tolerance dependency issue . Surgical strategy tend reserve severe case limited risk complication typically associate surgery include bleeding , bruising , scar , infection . A nonsurgical , minimally invasive , long-lasting approach chronic pain management desirable . The Cryo-Touch III pain management device develop novel , minimally invasive procedure use focused cold therapy target sensory nerve tissue offer long-lasting pain relief cryoanalgesia . The device operate well-established cryobiology principle localize exposure control moderately low temperature condition alter tissue function . The therapy treat nerve low temperature via cold probe form assembly small diameter needle , create highly localize treatment zone around probe . This focused cold therapy create conduction block prevents nerve signal . Though study prove efficacious target motor nerve , device 's effect sensory nerve yet investigate clinical setting . The goal study describe herein evaluate degree duration effect Cryo-Touch III reduce chronic pain target sensory nerve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female , 18 year age old . Participants must meet American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria osteoarthritis knee ( unilateral bilateral ) . Clinical criterion include knee pain least three follow 6 criterion : 50 year age old , stiffness last less 30 minute , crepitus , bony tenderness , bony enlargement , and/or warmth touch . Any medication ( prescription and/or overthe counter ) must maintain stable schedule ≥ 2 week prior treatment . No washout period allow . An average Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) pain ≥ 4 last 30 day . Subject willing able give write informed consent . Subject willing able comply study instruction commit followup visit duration study . Subject good general health free systemic disease state physical condition might impair evaluation investigator 's opinion , expose subject unacceptable risk study participation . A partial full knee replacement ( treated knee ) . Any use systemic injection ( area ) within last 6 month . Current enrollment investigational drug device study specifically target pain treatment . Any additional diagnosis opinion investigator may directly contribute knee pain . Any concomitant inflammatory disease condition affect joint ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis , metabolic bone disease , gout , active infection , etc. ) . Any clot disorder and/or use anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin , clopidogrel , etc . ) within seven ( 7 ) day prior administration device . Allergy intolerance lidocaine . Any local skin condition treatment site investigator 's opinion would adversely affect treatment outcomes . Any chronic medical condition investigator 's opinion would prevent adequate participation . Any chronic medication use ( prescription , overthecounter , etc . ) investigator 's opinion would affect study participation subject safety . For reason , opinion investigator , subject may suitable candidate study participation ( i.e. , history noncompliance , drug dependency , related knee injury due worker 's compensation claim , etc . ) .</criteria>
