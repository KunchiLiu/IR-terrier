	<brief_summary>Critical ischaemia pain rest result poor blood flow lack oxygen deliver tissue . It normally affect hands foot debilitate . It particularly common difficult treat patient end stage renal failure Patients renal failure often high risk operative intervention might help pain . Often treatment option painkiller . Unfortunately however , commonly use painkiller , example morphine , know cause bad side effect patient renal failure ( drowsiness , confusion etc . Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % ) new treatment make chilli pepper apply skin patch work directly nerve ending skin prevent pain . It therefore systemic side effect drug . It demonstrate beneficial painful condition example post-shingles pain nerve pain HIV . It never use critical ischaemia . We propose investigate efficacy Qutenza treat patient end stage renal failure painful ischaemia . We recruit 20 patient painful ischaemia treat Qutenza . We follow 12 week monitor change pain score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Qutenza Critical Ischaemia End Stage Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral vascular disease common end-stage renal failure ( ESRF ) affect 24-77 % patient ( Stack , 2005 ) . Critical ischaemia ( pain rest cause insufficient blood supply limb ) notoriously difficult treat patient group . Advanced disease extensive co-morbidities limit surgical revascularisation option proximal vessel ( Blankensteijn et al. , 1996 ) calciphylaxis ( process calcification within small vessel unique patient end-stage renal failure ) effective treatment ( Ng &amp; Peng , 2011 ) . Often treatment option symptomatic relief strong analgesic . Effective pain relief patient end-stage renal failure difficult achieve . The active metabolite many opiate renally-excreted side effect common patient end-stage renal failure . In particular , confusion drowsiness limit use . Similarly drug commonly use neuropathic pain , gabapentin , investigated clinical trial patient end-stage renal failure ( Kurella et al. , 1993 ) . A drug renally excrete , minimal systemic absorption require dose adjustment renal failure , attractive treatment option patient renal failure . Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % ) advance dermal application system design rapid delivery capsaicin skin . The high concentration capsaicin result reversible desensitisation TRPV-1 express cutaneous sensory nerve ending reduction nerve fibre density epidermis ( Noto et al. , 2009 ) . The result pain relief long-lasting ( 12 week single application ) ( Backonja et al. , 2008 ) ; Simpson et al. , 2008 ) . Previous phase III study demonstrate significant reduction neuropathic pain patient post-herpetic neuralgia ( Blonsky et al. , 2009 ) HIV neuropathy ( Noto et al. , 2099 ; Simpson et al. , 2008 ) good tolerability profile license use treatment neuropathic pain patient group . The efficacy tolerability Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % ) evaluate 1,600 patient within clinical trial , reduction pain score 8 week 30-32 % 20-24 % compare active control ( capsaicin 0.04 % ) ( Simpson et al. , 2008 ) . Patients frequently develop mild irritant symptom erythema itch site application , significant side effect blister rare occur &lt; 5 % . Currently Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % ) license treatment diabetic however evidence moderate number diabetic enrol clinical trial Qutenza safe effective patient group also . Webster et al , ( 2011 ) treat total 91 patient painful diabetic nephropathy find 31.5 % reduction mean pain score week 2-12 post treatment . There difference incidence local side effect experience diabetic non-diabetics ( Backonja et al , 2011 ) . One patient develop ulcer area treatment however unclear whether related treatment ( Webster et al , 2011 ) . Diabetic patient enrol trial due frequency diabetic patient renal failure contribute role diabetes small vessel disease lead critical ischaemia . The distinction painful diabetic neuropathy digital critical ischaemia difficult make clinically may small proportion patient recruit study also element diabetic neuropathy addition critical ischaemia . In view concern ulceration foot diabetic treat Qutenza , patient diabetic neuropathy cause loss sensation exclude foot treat . Pain critical ischaemia multi-modal notoriously difficult treat particularly patient establish renal failure analgesic agent poorly tolerate . A drug Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % ) renally excrete , minimal systemic absorption require dose adjustment renal failure , attractive treatment option patient renal failure . This single centre , prospective observational trial evaluate efficacy tolerability Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % ) treatment digital critical ischaemia patient end stage renal failure . Primary Objective : • To evaluate safety efficacy Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % ) relieve chronic neuropathic pain digital critical ischaemia patient end stage renal failure Secondary objective : • To evaluate Quality Life ( QoL ) measure patient end stage renal failure chronic neuropathic pain critical ischaemia treat Qutenza ( topical capsaicin 8 % )</detailed_description>
