	<brief_summary>Spasticity - movement disorder , part syndrome defeat top motor-neuron , characterize rate-dependent increase muscle tone increase dry-core reflection hyperexcitability stretch receptor ( Lance , 1980 ) . Spasticity - frequent symptom neurological disease ( Valero-Cabre , Pascual-Leone , 2005 ) may accompany disorder consequence stroke , multiple sclerosis , head trauma spinal cord , cerebral palsy , etc . The magnitude severity spasticity depend level lesion , duration existence time disease , possible plastic change axons synapsis affect level . There two basic model spasticity : cerebral ( hemiplegic ) spinal ( paraplegicheskaya ) ( Nikitin , 2005 ) .

	<detailed_description>Spasticity associate excessive activation stretch reflex , second occur upper motor neuron injury ( Young , 1994 ) , lead reduction spinal inhibition , manifest reduction presynaptic inhibition Ia afferent come muscle spindle flexor ( Nielsen et al. , 1995 ) disinapticheskogo reciprocal Ia inhibition antagonist muscle afferent ( Meunier Pierrot-Deseilligny , 1998 ; Nielsen et al. , 2007 ) , abnormal activity Ib afferent tendon Golgi complex ( autogenous Ib inhibition ) , result relief instead inhibit alpha-motoneurons ( Delwaide Olivier , 1988 ) , deterioration motor neuron inhibit rekkurentnogo Renshaw cell ( Katz Pier-rot-Deseilligny , 1982 , 1999 ) . There two basic model spasticity : cerebral ( hemiplegic ) spinal ( paraplegicheskaya ) ( Nikitin , 2005 ) . Cerebral model shine direct injury brain characterize increased excitability monosynaptic reflex quick reflex development pathological characteristic hemiplegic posture . Model characterize spinal spasticity opposite low segmental inhibition polysynaptic reflex slow increase nervous excitability due mechanism cumulative excitation overexcitation flexor extensor muscle , well expansion area segmental response ( Nikitin , 2005 ) . According recent study mechanisms cerebral spinal spasticity different . According researcher increase activity ( excitability ) motor cortex increase inhibitory effect corticospinal tract reduce hyperactivity gamma alpha motor neuron ( Valero-Cabre , Pascual-Leone , 2005 ; Valero-Cabre et al. , 2001 ; Valle et al . , 2007 ) . According statement special place method correction spasticity take neuromodulation technique , one rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation ( RTMS ) . In widely discuss mechanisms action RTMS reduce spasticity , explain efficacy MS , spinal cord injury , stroke cerebral palsy ( Nielsen et al. , 1996 ; Kumru et al. , 2010 ; Mori et al. , 2011 ) . However , date , conclusive evidence explain mechanism reduce spinal cerebral spasticity RTMS . From point view , particularly interesting study excitability motor cortex pair TMS study phenomenon vnutrikorkovogo inhibition motor response ( SISI English literature ) vnutrikorkovogo facilitate induce motor response ( ICF English language ) , allow study mechanism differentiate inhibition excitation central nervous system different level ( Chen et al. , 1998 ) . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) technique , one hand , consider way assess neyroplasticheskih process , , special mode , neyromoduliruyuschego impact . In assess neyroplasticheskih process use TMS play major role TMS mapping . Since patient undergo stroke , show significant decrease cortical projection ( map ) muscle hand side affect hemisphere ( Nikitin , Kurenkov , 2003 ) , also point change cortical excitability . A special role evaluation excitability cortical representation muscle play double TMS different interval stimuli . This technique allow assess process intracrustal relationship : inhibition facilitation . RTMS , method neuromodulation , use large number neurological disease : consequence stroke , Parkinson 's disease , epilepsy , pain , etc . With success technique apply spasticity ( eg , Mori et al. , 2009 ) . The mechanism modulate influence TMS consider two perspective : impact excitability cortical spinal center . RTMS low frequency ( 1 Hz ) use decrease excitability motor cortex , demonstrate reduced amplitude motor response ( WMO ) ( Chen et al. , 1997 ) . High-frequency stimulation ( 5 Hz ) use increase cortical excitability - increase amplitude WMO ( Berardelli et al. , 1998 ) . Continuous stimulation 5 Hz lead prolongation effect . It believe application TMS motor cortex excite corticospinal neuron . These neuron , founder corticospinal tract affect alpha gamma motor neuron spinal cord , Ia afferent , interneurons . Thus , use TMS lead change excitability neuron spinal level . The main parameter study electrophysiological spinal excitability H-reflex ( similar stretch reflex ) ( Mori et al. , 2009 ) . It show TMS change parameter H-reflex induce soleus muscle . TMS single stimulus lead change muscle low extremity , decrease frequency presynaptic inhibition Ia afferent ( Meunier Pierrot-Deseilligny , 1998 ) . Moreover , above-threshold magnetic stimulation motor cortex frequency 5 Hz result reduce H-reflex 900 m muscle forearm ( Berardelli et al. , 1998 ) . In contrast , TMS motor cortex 1 Hz decrease amplitude WMO ( Touge et al. , 2001 ) , increase effect H-reflex ( Valero-Cabre et al. , 2001 ) . It also show stimulation change M &amp; A stimulation peripheral nerve , amplitude ratio H / M increase ( Valero-Cabre et al. , 2001 ) . This fact indicate low-frequency stimulation facilitate monosynaptic spinal reflex inhibit effect corticospinal excitability spinal cord . More recent study examine effect short session 20-pulse stimulation cortical representation foot 5 Hz spinal level . Found WMO soleus tibialis anterior muscle rise alone , H-reflex reduce 1 second . RTMS 5 Hz also cause increase long-term depression H-reflex soleus muscle cause stimulation common peroneal nerve reduce H-reflex facilitation stimulation femoral nerve . Reduction H-reflex high-frequency TMS partially explain increase presynaptic inhibition Ia-afferents ( Perez et al. , 2005 ) . This mechanism consider one possible effect antispastic TMS . However , date , question mechanism underlie effect TMS neyromodulyatsionnyh spasticity , remain open . In addition , present time study motor area brain method transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) addition stimulation one-off incentive also apply paired stimulation technique allow study local change cortical excitability . The essence pair stimulation consistently serve two magnetic stimulus , first area brain supply conditioning , motor cortex - test stimulus . Changes cortical excitability measure change amplitude motor response ( WMO ) steam stimulation compare amplitude WMO response isolate test stimulus . The widely use kind paired stimulation stimulation subthreshold above-threshold conditioning test stimulus , consistently apply area motor cortex . In case , use interpulse interval 1 5 m observe phenomenon so-called braking vnutrikorkovogo WMO , interpulse interval 7 20 millisecond - phenomenon vnutrikorkovogo facilitate WMO ( respectively , SICI ICF English language ) ( Conte A. et al . , 2008 ) . Many study show different nature phenomenon SICI ICF absence direct communication ( V. Di Lazzaro et al. , 2006 ) . The high localization phenomenon SICI ICF , dependence position magnetic coil ( Cathrin M. Butefisch et al. , 2005 , Liepert J. et al. , 1998 ) . This suggest subtle change study local cortical excitability use paired stimulation preferable use TMS possibility precise navigation , example , system nTMS - NBS Eximia Nexstim . The study excitability motor cortex pair TMS study phenomena SISI ICF might interest study pathogenesis spasticity brain damage , defeat spinal cord . The phenomenon study paired TMS stimulation , approach study mechanisms differential inhibition excitation central nervous system different level . In literature , conclusive data effect various parameter RTMS vnutrikorkogo phenomenon inhibition facilitation different model spasticity .</detailed_description>
