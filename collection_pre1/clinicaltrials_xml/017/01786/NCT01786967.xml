	<brief_title>Understanding Response Fesoterodine Through Genetic Evaluation Elderly ( URGE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urge urinary incontinence ( UUI ) , characterize unpredictable embarrass large volume urine leakage , major public health burden elderly woman , give high prevalence , impairment quality life , associate caregiver burden , substantial economic cost . UUI significantly prevalent old adult disproportionately affect woman , prevalence 19 % community-dwelling woman 65 60-78 % long-term care female resident . Anticholinergic medication common first-line therapy UUI . Although numerous trial demonstrate anticholinergic efficacious UUI , response medication variable , effectiveness often limited poor response adverse event ( AEs ) , cognitive impairment constipation , particularly problematic old adult . Furthermore , comprehensive systematic review conclude one drug definitively superior , leave clinician without evidence guide decision-making regard drug choice . As result , UUI pharmacotherapy empiric personalize , even though clear individual variation exist response toxicity . The treatment UUI especially challenge geriatric population , give high risk AEs , polypharmacy , pharmacokinetic change occur age . The ability predict elderly woman UUI experience low efficacy develop significant adverse event anticholinergic medication would paradigm shift therapeutic practice highly prevalent bothersome condition . Pharmacogenetics may provide insight predict response anticholinergic UUI therapy . Research already show genetic difference drug metabolism impact patient 's drug response . For example , `` fast metabolizers '' may metabolize drug rapidly therapeutic level never reach , limit effectiveness . In contrast , `` slow metabolizers '' may develop high drug concentration , result significantly AEs . While pharmacogenetic research exist numerous class drug , include anticoagulant , selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors,14 beta-blockers , immunosuppressant opioids , type translational research exist anticholinergic UUI . Thus , propose project represent novel concept unique opportunity dramatically change UUI pharmacotherapy . Fesoterodine ideal anticholinergic medication launch pharmacogenetic study field . Fesoterodine 's active metabolite , 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine ( 5-HMT ) , metabolize well-characterized cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzyme , CYP2D6 . The CYP2D6 gene several genetic variant , result different metabolizer status range poor metabolizers ( PM ) , intermediate metabolizers ( IM ) , extensive metabolizers ( EM ) , ultrarapid metabolizers ( UM ) . These different CYP2D6 profile may clinically important , may contribute variability efficacy AEs . In fact , pharmaceutical company data fesoterodine demonstrate PMs two-fold high plasma concentration EMs ; however , publish data exist CYP2D6 metabolizer status correlate clinical outcome efficacy AEs . The ability use CYP2D6 metabolizer status predict individual experience low efficacy develop AEs fesoterodine , utilize alternative therapy woman , would challenge exist therapeutic paradigm would significantly advance clinical practice via pharmacogenetic approach . Specific Aim 1 : To explore whether CYP2D6 metabolizer status predict efficacy 4 week fesoterodine fumarate therapy elderly woman UUI . All subject start fesoterodine 4mg 2 week follow 8mg 2 week . The primary outcome patient-reported treatment response base 4-point scale utilized phase III clinical trials.8,9 We hypothesize woman rapidly metabolize fesoterodine base CYP2D6 metabolizer status likely low efficacy . Specific Aim 2 : To explore whether CYP2D6 metabolizer status predict moderate severe adverse event 4 week fesoterodine fumarate therapy elderly woman UUI . In study design Aim # 1 , identify subject moderate severe fesoterodine-related AEs . We hypothesize woman CYP2D6 poor metabolizers likely moderate severe AEs . Specific Aim 3 : To utilize preliminary data pilot , proof-of-concept study plan future large-scale trial predict outcomes anticholinergic UUI therapy base CYP2D6 metabolizer status . Data regard efficacy rate , risk moderate-severe AEs , impact CYP2D6 metabolizer status efficacy AEs , addition information regard recruitment , drop-out , questionnaire burden , critically inform study design , outcome measure sample size future , definitive trial . This proposal represent innovative approach pharmacotherapy UUI , highly prevalent condition significant morbidity . Pharmacogenetics tremendous potential identify ideal candidate anticholinergic UUI therapy distinguish individual may benefit alternative treatment option . This pioneering pharmacogenetic research potential lay necessary groundwork future long-term research would optimize personalize UUI therapy million elderly woman . Design &amp; Procedures : Patient Population : All woman age 50 year old desire treatment bothersome UUI approach enrollment . Women ≥ 3 UUI episode 3-day void diary include . Although woman previously fail fesoterodine exclude , fail UUI anticholinergic remain eligible 2-week washout period . Subjects auditory visual sensory impairment include . If visual impairment exists , research coordinator provide assistance complete necessary document . However , unable complete study-related item visit , woman cognitive impairment , base Mini-Cog validated questionnaire exclude .</detailed_description>
