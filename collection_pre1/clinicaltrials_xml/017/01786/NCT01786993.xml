	<brief_summary>This IDE study prospective , randomize , double-blind , multi-center clinical study evaluate safety efficacy patient treatment MPP compare patient treatment standard BiV pace 9 month . The study conduct maximum 50 investigational center locate United States . A maximum 506 subject implant Quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy device ( CRT-D ) system enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MultiPoint Pacing IDE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject undergo 2 dimensional Echocardiogram within 30 day prior implant , 3 , 6 9 month post implant . At implant , final LV pacing configuration program use one 10 available pace vector . The paced/sensed atrioventricular ( AV ) interventricular ( VV ) delay may optimize per site 's standard care . Subjects continue receive BiV therapy 3-month follow-up visit . At 3-month visit , responder status Enrollment 3 month assess use Clinical Composite Score ( CCS ) . All subject `` Improved '' use definition outline CCS group together Responders . All subject `` Worsened '' `` Unchanged '' use definition outline CCS consider Non-responders . All subject undergo acute measurement cardiac performance ( e.g. , Echocardiography ) various MPP combination compare BiV pace . Only subject `` equal better '' echocardiographic measurement ( i.e. , EA VTI measurement ) MPP feature compare BiV pace randomize 1:1 ratio one two arm - BiV arm MPP arm . At 9-month visit , responder status evaluate use CCS compare status 3 month .</detailed_description>
