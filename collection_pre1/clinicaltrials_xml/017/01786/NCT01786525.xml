	<brief_title>House Calls Decision Support : Improving Access Live Donor Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For adult late Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD Stage 4 5 ) , kidney transplantation yield superior outcome compare long-term dialysis . Unfortunately , demand kidney transplantation far exceed supply decease donor organ . For patient healthy willing living kidney donor , live donor kidney transplantation ( LDKT ) produce superior graft patient survival rate , low acute rejection rate , rapid improvement functional status , low healthcare cost . However , profound racial income disparity access LDKT . Minorities , especially Blacks Hispanics , substantially less likely receive LDKT compare Whites . Also , overall decline LDKTs United States recent year pronounce Blacks patient less household income . These low LDKT rate contribute longer wait time transplantation , dialysis exposure , high likelihood death transplantation , decline functional capacity , less optimal graft outcome transplantation , high healthcare cost . Therefore , intervention expand access LDKT , especially target minority low-income population , need give current project shortage decease donor organ . There several hypothesize barrier LDKT minority low-income patient , include perceive discrimination , health care mistrust , social network difference , high rate condition preclude live kidney donation , high indirect cost live donation , less knowledge concern LDKT , failure provide culturally competent education patient support system . In last decade , PI develop evaluate innovative House Calls intervention design remove LDKT barriers.28-30 Health educator deliver comprehensive interactive program kidney transplantation live donation patient 's home member social network present . Relative standard clinic-based educational program , House Calls intervention superior improve LDKT knowledge , reduce LDKT concern , increase LDKT willingness , increase rate LDKT , particularly minority low-income patient ( see Preliminary Studies section ) . However , effectiveness House Calls intervention may limit absence decision-making aid , exposure appropriate peer model , assistance develop LDKT action plan beyond House Calls intervention . This limitation feedback study participant inform strategy enhance House Calls intervention incorporate Patient-Centered Decision Support component . Additionally , press need identify factor critical success House Calls intervention determine whether reduce gender disparity live kidney donation.8 Therefore , propose study , plan pursue two primary aim one exploratory aim : Primary Aims 1 . Evaluate differential benefit add patient-centered decision support component House Calls intervention . In randomized controlled trial , compare House Calls ( HC ) alone House Calls + Decision Support ( HC+DS ) sample minority low-income patient . It hypothesize , compare HC alone , HC+DS group high proportion patient LDKT 2-yr study endpoint ( primary outcome ) high proportion patient ≥1 live donor inquiry , ≥1 live donor evaluation , LDKT Readiness Stages 4/5 12-wk assessment ( secondary outcome ) . 2 . Identify mediator relationship intervention occurrence LDKT . We investigate set mediator House Calls may increase occurrence LDKT , include increase LDKT knowledge , change LDKT readiness , reduce LDKT concern , reduce health care mistrust , amount time discuss LDKT others quality interaction , improvement self-efficacy discuss LDKT others . Exploratory Aim 3 . Examine whether House Calls intervention reduces gender disparity rate live kidney donation . Women comprise 60 % live kidney donor past decade . We show House Calls intervention directly educate significantly potential living donor , include men , compare standard clinic-based educational approach . We hypothesize high proportion patient receive House Calls intervention ( either HC alone HC+DS ) least one potential male donor evaluate likely receive LDKT male live donor , relative non-intervention control group , control patient race/ethnicity , gender , age , household income .</detailed_description>
