	<brief_title>Study To Analyze Memory/Thinking Problems In Older Adults After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment major cardiac non-cardiac surgery occur high rate old adult . The result previous study indicate certain neuro-imaging marker determine individual pose great risk memory thinking change surgery . Based pilot study , evidence pre-surgical neuroimaging biomarkers associate memory executive decline well control surgical procedure ( total knee antroplasty ) . In study , researcher use brain imaging study determine patient likely affect cognitive change type surgery . The use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) help investigator identify brain biomarkers associate cognitive problem , white matter abnormality change small blood vessel . Patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery , well group non-surgery participant similar age , education health status , receive cognitive test MRI brain scan surgery/non-surgery . Researchers compare monitor group one year surgery/non-surgery . Prior enrollment , participant ask review inform consent provide write consent participate study . The enrollment phase involve in-person baseline assessment cognitive functioning within two week schedule surgery/non-surgery order rule exclusion criterion . Testing cooperation University Florida General Clinical Research Center . Post-baseline MRI conduct participant ( surgery/control ) within 48 hour surgery/pseudo-surgery date identify acute stroke difference baseline . Cognitive assessment conduct participant three-weeks , three-months , one-year surgery . The research highly significant first study use in-vivo diffusion image method examine contribution specific presurgical neuroanatomical vulnerability executive memory cognitive decline one common orthopedic surgery seek old adult . Additionally , first study examine specific neuroimaging biomarkers interact negatively specific peri-operative variable include emboli number surgery , embolic change brain , anesthesia depth , cerebral oxygenation . The finding study improve pre-surgery screening procedure old adult assist development peri-operative intervention prevent neurodegenerative disease acceleration .</detailed_description>
