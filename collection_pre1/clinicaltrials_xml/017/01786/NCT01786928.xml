	<brief_title>The Role Resistance Exercise Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute exacerbation common patient COPD cause specific sign symptom , increase dyspnea , productive cough alter sputum , fever . With disease progression , exacerbation frequent negative impact health relate quality life pulmonary function well increase mortality . More severe exacerbation require hospitalization result enormous health expenditure , severely reduce daily life activity decline peripheral muscle strength partially reverse 3 month . Despite many feature point responsible decrease muscle strength hospitalization , physical inactivity seem important . Resistance train interesting therapeutic option prevent and/or reverse muscular dysfunction due immobilise healthy subject stable COPD patient induces hypertrophy type II fiber , increase muscle strength exercise tolerance . In addition , provokes low dyspnea perception effort compare exercise training . Despite benefit stable COPD , impact resistance exercise program hospitalization remain poorly know .</detailed_description>
