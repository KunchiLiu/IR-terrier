	<brief_summary>Worldwide , 1 12 couple experience difficulty get pregnant seek help assist reproductive technology ( ART ) vitro fertilization ( IVF-egg fertilize sperm outside body ) , ovarian stimulation ( medication use stimulate egg development ) intra-cytoplasmic injection ( ICSI-single sperm inject directly egg ) . Regardless ART procedure perform , newly fertilize embryo must still implant mother endometrium ( inner line uterus ) . This implantation process human surprisingly inefficient account 50 % ART failures . Intrauterine infusion hCG prior embryo transfer recently show increase pregnancy rate cellular mechanism increase unknown . Successful implantation require newly fertilize embryo endometrium develop synchronized manner . This coordinate development accomplish , part , proteins secrete embryo circulate throughout maternal bloodstream alert maternal body organ ( i.e . ovary , endometrium , breast , ect ) fertilization occur . One early secrete protein human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) , molecule detect over-the-counter pregnancy test . From previous study , know hCG production embryo alert ovary continue produce progesterone , hormone required pregnancy . However , little known direct effect hCG endometrium early pregnancy human . Using animal model , hCG show induce specific change endometrium , suggest embryo-derived hCG may `` prim '' endometrium anticipation implantation . The goal research study examine direct effect hCG human endometrium see `` prim effect '' also present human . Findings research may reveal whether pre-treatment hCG enhance ART outcomes , especially pregnancy rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Embryo implantation human surprisingly inefficient represent major limit factor enhancement ART success rate ( ref 1-2 ) . Successful implantation require synchronize development newly fertilize embryo maternal endometrium within specific window time . In mammal , coordinate development accomplish , part , embryonic secretion alert body fertilization occur . One early protein produce embryo human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . Previous research show hCG maintain progesterone production ovary , hormone require maintenance pregnancy . However , little known direct effect hCG human endometrium . Our laboratory previously show intrauterine infusion hCG non-human primate induce endometrial change mimic initial stage early pregnancy ( i.e . alter cellular morphology , pre-decidual response increase glandular activity ; ref 3-4 ) . These result suggest embryo-derived hCG may also act directly upon endometrium `` prime '' anticipation implantation . Research labs examine effect hCG endometrial gene vitro support hypothesis ( ref : 5-9 ) . Additionally , recent study woman undergo ART reveal significantly increase implantation pregnancy rate embryo transfer precede intra-uterine infusion 500IU hCG ( ref 10 ) . The purpose study determine whether endometrial response hCG see previously non-human primate model also present woman characterize effect . Women plan undergo control ovarian stimulation purpose egg donation eligible participate research . Subjects experimental group receive single intrauterine infusion hCG ( 500IU ) dilute IVF medium 3 day oocyte retrieval . Control subject receive single intrauterine infusion IVF medium . Two day infusion , experimental group control participants return clinic sample endometrial tissue obtain via pipelle biopsy sample uterine secretory protein obtain via uterine lavage . The uterine lavage sample examine use ELISA/proteomic analysis determine effect hCG uterine protein secretion . One portion endometrial biopsy formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded analysis morphological structural change follow hCG exposure . The second portion use cellular molecular analysis determine effect hCG gene proteins interest .</detailed_description>
