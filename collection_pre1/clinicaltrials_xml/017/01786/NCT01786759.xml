	<detailed_description>Parenteral nutrition ( PN ) widely successfully use pediatric population 40 year , serious significant life-threatening complication today continue parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis ( PNAC ) . Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis indeed worrisome complication difficult treat may progress eventual cirrhosis liver failure namely parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease ( PNALD ) . Two type lipid emulsion currently use adult well pediatric patient : one lipid emulsion prepared soybean oil compose long-chain triacylglycerols ( LCTs ) , lipid emulsion compose 50 % medium-chain triacylglycerols ( MCTs ) 50 % LCT soybean oil . A new lipid emulsion prepared mixture soybean oil olive oil contains LCTs low proportion ( 20 % ) polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) 60 % monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFAs ) . So compare different fat emulsion , want see olive oil lipid emulsion improve hepatic tolerance preterm infant .</detailed_description>
