	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn treatment hormone therapy combination abiraterone acetate prednisone 8 month control disease well treatment standard hormone therapy alone . Abiraterone acetate design decrease production testosterone ( male sex hormone ) , play role cause prostate cancer grow . Prednisone commonly use treat prostate cancer give along abiraterone acetate treatment help lower prevent side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finite Androgen Ablation vs. Finite Androgen Ablation Combination With Abiraterone Acetate Prednisone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( like flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance assign group . If Group 1 , receive standard care hormonal therapy . The study doctor decide hormone therapy receive explain take hormone therapy risk . If Group 2 , also receive standard care hormone therapy . In addition , take 4 abiraterone acetate tablet mouth day least 2 hour meal 1 hour meal . You also take prednisone every day . About every 28-days consider `` cycle . '' You return unused study drug and/or empty pill bottle end cycle . Study Visits Group 1 : On Day 1 Cycles 1 , 5 , 9 every odd cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask side effect may drug treatment may receive . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check liver function PSA testosterone level . Before Cycle 5 blood draw , must fast overnight morning least 8 hour visit . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check liver function PSA level . On Cycles 3 7 , blood also use check testosterone level . These test may do local facility result fax MD Anderson . Study Visits Group 2 : Every 2 week ( first 12 week ) , blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw test liver function . This may do local facility result fax MD Anderson . On Day 1 Odd Cycles ( 1 , 3 , 5 , ) : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may drug treatment may receive . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check liver function PSA testosterone level . Before Cycle 5 blood draw , must fast overnight morning least 8 hour visit . On Day 1 Even Cycles ( 2 , 4 , 6 , ) : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may drug treatment may receive . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check liver function PSA level . These study visit may do local physician 's office result fax MD Anderson . Length Study : You may receive study drug 8 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End Treatment Visit : When longer take study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect may drug treatment may receive . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check liver function , check PSA testosterone level . You must fast overnight morning least 8 hour visit . - You bone scan check status disease - You CT scan check status disease . Follow-Up : Every 3 month , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test PSA testosterone level . This may do local local facility result fax MD Anderson . Every 6 month : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check liver function , PSA level testosterone level . The follow-up visit continue long disease stable . Crossover Study Phase : If disease get bad study , eligible extension phase . If receive hormone therapy alone , treated combination hormone abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 8 month . If receive combination therapy , receive hormone therapy alone . If crossover treatment group study , schedule visit extension study identical schedule describe . This investigational study . Abiraterone acetate FDA approve combination prednisone treatment patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receive prior chemotherapy contain docetaxel . Prednisone FDA approve commercially available corticosteroid . The use hormone therapy combination abiraterone prednisone patient prostate cancer investigational . Up 310 patient take part multicenter study . Up 310 patient enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
