	<detailed_description>Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) new therapeutic option treat fecal incontinence . Its efficacy yield 80 % approximately , mecanims action remain poorly understood . In particular , SNS restore anal squeezing contraction increase anal tone . Recently , use porcine model , show SNS change colonic permeability , suggest SNS may activate enteric nervous system ( ENS ) . The investigator hypothtized therefore SNS could act enteric nervous system ( ENS ) . To verify hypothesis , investigator collect biopsy sample patient implantation SNS . The investigator assess whether SNS induces change ENS , correlate SNS efficacy .</detailed_description>
