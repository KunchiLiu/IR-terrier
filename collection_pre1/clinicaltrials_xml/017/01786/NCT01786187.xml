	<brief_summary>Little known symptom experience person undergo surgery lung cancer . What know symptoms common become severe lasting . The main purpose study two-fold : 1 . To good understand symptom experience person lung cancer prior surgery six week return home hospital . 2 . To examine role light physical activity program person undergo surgery lung cancer treatment specific symptom . The goal study include : - Collecting information participant 's current prior health history , symptom , health-related quality life . - Assessing ability recruit participant study . - Assessing participant 's level participation . - Evaluating participant 's satisfaction program . We expect patient undergoing surgery lung cancer recovery process experience multiple symptom . We also expect find light intensity physical activity program feasible , acceptable , show positive impact symptom cancer-related fatigue confidence cancer-related fatigue self-management . Information gain randomize control trial study use refine design future larger-scale study target symptom cancer-related fatigue lung cancer population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Symptom Experience Study Persons With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures : Participants randomly assign ( like flip coin ) one follow group upon completion collection initial information participant 's : current prior health history , symptom , health-related quality life , take 6-minute self-paced walking test measure walk ability . This test occur Spectrum Health facility surgery . Groups : 1 ) The Symptom Experience Group 2 ) Light Physical Activity Group Description Symptom Experience Group : In addition receive conventional treatment cancer , prescribe health care provider , receive plan , structure , weekly telephone visit report experience symptom health-related quality life question . In Symptom Experience Group : - Provide information current prior health history . - Take 6-minute self-paced walking test measure walk ability Spectrum Health facility surgery approximately 6-weeks return home hospital ( prior possible chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy ) . - Wear pedometer day study record number step take day . - Contact nurse researcher study related question . - Record information comment daily diary ( take approximately 2 minute complete day ) answer research question via weekly telephone visit throughout study . If wish take part study need : - Keep study appointment . - Tell telephone research assistant medication take . - Tell telephone research assistant side effect , doctor visit , hospitalization may whether think related study . In Symptom Experience Group receive : - Program education prior surgery . - A telephone visit within 3 day ( 24 hour optimum ) discharge hospital ask question health interview take approximately 30 minute . - The health interview reschedule completion within 3 day hospital discharge feel well enough complete interview . - At end week 1-6 , make telephone visit complete health questionnaire interview take 15 minute except week 3 6 take approximately 30 minute . - Upon completion participation Symptom Experience Group , receive information regard light physical activity program . - Upon completion study , provide overview result study . Description Light Physical Activity Group : In addition receive conventional treatment cancer , prescribe health care provider , receive home-based light physical activity program help manage specific symptom related cancer cancer treatment . In Light Physical Activity Group : - Provide information current prior health history . - Take 6-minute self-paced walking test measure walk ability Spectrum Health facility surgery approximately 6-weeks return home hospital ( prior possible chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy ) . - Participate self-scheduled , home-based physical activity program help learn manage specific symptom related cancer cancer treatment total six week follow return home hospital . - Participate time commitment start 5 minute day 5 day week gradually increase 30 minute day 5 day week able week 6 . - Wear pedometer day study record number step take day . - Record information comment daily diary ( take approximately 2 minute complete day ) answer research question via weekly telephone visit throughout study . - Contact nurse researcher study related question . If wish take part study need : - Keep study appointment . - Tell nurse medication take . - Tell nurse side effect , doctor visit , hospitalization may whether think related study . In Light Physical Activity Group receive : - Program education prior surgery . - A telephone visit nurse within 3 day ( 24 hour optimum ) discharge hospital : - Ask question symptom see ready start light physical activity program take approximately 5 minute . - If ready , arrange home visit within 4 day discharge . - If ready , contact surgeon help call day ass ready start . - A telephone visit research assistant within 3 day ( 24 hour optimum ) discharge hospital : - Ask question health interview take approximately 30 minute . - The health interview reschedule completion within 3 day hospital discharge feel well enough complete interview . - The first home visit nurse surgery take approximately 2 hour nurse : - Assemble teach operate physical activity equipment . - Assist complete first physical activity day . - Follow-up first home visit telephone visit within 24 hour answer question concern program . - At begin week two , nurse make one home visit , begin week 3-6 nurse make telephone visit collect review record information . - The nurse available make additional home telephone visit need assistance . - At end week 1-6 , research staff make telephone visit complete health questionnaire interview take 15 minute except week 3 6 take approximately 30 minute . We expect 86 person , 21 year age old schedule surgery treat lung cancer west Michigan area participate study . The potential risk Symptom Experience Light Physical Activity Groups Include : Risks associate six-minute walk test consider low . The study may involve risk currently unknown unforeseeable . Risks may include limited : - You may stumble fall , get short breath , experience muscle cramp , nausea , chest pain , abnormal blood pressure . - The walk test self-paced participant six-minutes stop want stop . The potential risk study Light Physical activity Group Include : - The light physical activity program prescribe study corresponds normal every day activity mildly exert pose great challenge normal activity daily living : - Strolling slowly home work . Grocery shopping . - Performing light work house make bed , wash dish , prepare food , dusting , carry trash . - Riding lawn mower mow lawn walk apply seed fertilizer lawn . - Walking mall ; Bird watching . - The development increase activity-dependent symptom fatigue muscle joint soreness . - The reaction body physical activity always predict accuracy risk fall walk and/or stand place . - As part program involve use television , people ( 1 4,000 ) may seizures blackout trigger light flash pattern watch television playing thing video game even n't seizure . - The reaction body physical activity always predict accuracy safety procedure provide participant prior participation . Safety procedure include limited : - Following physical activity prescription safety procedure . - Using tool monitor heart rate heart rate wristwatch monitor . - Telephone access available light physical activity . - Accessing nurse researcher concern . Potential Benefits Study : We promise benefit others take part research . It hop learn study may benefit lung cancer patient future . If agree take part study receive result study future follow study completion . We notify significant new finding develop course study might affect willingness participate . The potential benefit Light Physical Activity Group may include : - Increased ability manage symptom related cancer treatment . - Increased ability perform day-to-day activity . - Increased heart lung ( cardiorespiratory ) fitness . - Receiving symptom management help professional registered nurse . - Feeling control symptom .
