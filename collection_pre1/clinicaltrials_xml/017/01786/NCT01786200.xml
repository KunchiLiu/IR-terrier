	<detailed_description>Bowel cancer second commonest cause death cancer UK . Of patient apparently curative operation , half unfortunately suffer disease recurrence die 5 year . Clearly research require improve outcome condition . Most current research focus antitumour strategy , however reaction patient ( host ) tumour also important . The host inflammatory response cancer likely represent part host-tumour relationship . Inflammation play important role predict patient die . Currently know whether antiinflammatory drug effect cancer relate inflammation detect blood in/around tumour . Aims : We hope demonstrate tumour related inflammation bowel cancer alter use anti- inflammatory drug . This may form rationale use antiinflammatory drug improve prognosis colorectal cancer patient undergo surgery . Methods : This pilot study investigate whether simple antiinflammatory drug alter marker inflammation blood in/around tumour . Patients bowel cancer surgery prescribe one two anti-inflammatory drug ( aspirin 75mg daily ibuprofen 400mg three time daily ) 2 3 week prior operation . Blood tumour sample treatment analyse . If study 's aim meet cancer-related inflammation alter prior surgery , large scale drug trial propose demonstrate reduce cancer recurrence improve survival .</detailed_description>
