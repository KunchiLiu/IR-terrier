	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare well 2 different dose schedule decitabine may help control AML . Decitabine design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Older Unfit Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 dose level decitabine base join study . If among first 20 participant , equal chance either group . If enroll , increasingly high chance ( 51-100 % ) assign group well result , depend much well treatment arm . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 4-8 week , depend doctor 's decision . In study receive induction therapy try control disease cause remission ( test and/or doctor find sign disease ) . If Group 1 , receive decitabine vein 1 hour 5 day . If Group 2 , receive decitabine vein 1 hour 10 day . If disease remission , may receive cycle ( call maintenance ) help keep disease control . If Group 2 , receive 5 day dose maintenance , doctor think best interest . Your dose schedule dose level may change doctor feel best interest . Study Visits : The following test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw 1-2 time weekly first cycle , every 2-4 week . After 6th cycle sooner doctor decides , blood draw perform 1 time per cycle . - Every 1-3 cycle , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) may also draw genetic test disease remission doctor think need . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up phone call . Follow-Up : After stop study treatment , call phone twice year ask feeling . The phone call last 5 minute time . This investigational study . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Its use treat AML investigational . Up 100 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients previously untreated AML ( WHO criteria , i.e . &gt; /= 20 % blast ) Prior biologic therapy ( growth factor ) target therapy administer treatment prior myelodysplastic syndrome allow , exception hypomethylating agent 5azacytidine decitabine . Patients must therapy 1 week prior enter study recover toxic effect therapy , unless evidence rapidly progressive disease . Hydroxyurea , single dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 , permit control count prior treatment . 2 . Patients &gt; /= 60 eligible candidate standard cytarabine plus anthracycline chemotherapy determine Kantarjian 's score ( Appendix D ) Patients young 60 may also include felt candidate intensive anthracycline plus cytarabine base chemotherapy . 3 . Performance 03 ( ECOG ) . 4 .
