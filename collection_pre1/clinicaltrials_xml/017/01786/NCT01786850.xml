	<brief_summary>Patients unresectable pancreatic cancer case benefit percutaneous ablation modality , due high risk procedure-related complication . Ultrasound-guided high intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) ablation introduce feasible treatment option patient . However , anatomical region US-guided HIFU replace accurate MR-guided focus ultrasound ( MRgFUS ) ablation , applicability latter technique treatment pancreatic cancer still unexplored . The aim study explore feasibility clinical performance MRgFUS ablation unresectable pancreatic cancer . Two main end-points : Pain palliation local tumor control . As compare conventional US-guided HIFU , MRgFUS could represent accurate , non-invasive ablation modality even unresectable pancreatic cancer although , date , case pancreatic MRgFUS ablation report .</brief_summary>
