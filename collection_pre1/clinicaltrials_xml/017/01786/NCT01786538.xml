	<brief_summary>Regorafenib prove improved survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer fail know standard chemotherapy ( The CORRECT study ) . The phase Ib study regorafenib plus FOLFOX FOLFIRI perform dose regorafenib fix ; 160 mg/day day 4 10 ( 7 day per cycle combine FOLFOX FOLFIRI ) . Regorafenib plus FOLFOX second-line chemotherapy mCRC patient progress first-line irinotecan-based chemotherapy study yet , unmet need discovery valid target agent combination second-line FOLFOX reason , investigator plan study regorafenib plus FOLFOX second-line chemotherapy mCRC patient progress first-line irinotecan-based chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Second-line FOLFOX With Without Regorafenib mCRC Patients Failed First-line Irinotecan Plus Fluoropyrimidines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Limited active drug available treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) present upfront doublet combination fluoropyrimidines plus either oxaliplatin irinotecan regard reference strategy patient appropriate intensive therapy . Before era target agent , treatment strategy term either combination sequence cytotoxic agent rather simple ; survival outcome differ accord either administration sequence oxaliplatin irinotecan , sequential versus combination chemotherapy treatment continuum . However , treatment strategy become complicated era target agent . In case failure first-line oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines ( FOLFOX CapeOX ) without bevacizumab , second-line chemotherapy FOLFIRI would administer treatment continuum , various target agent combined setting ; bevacizumab beyond progression patient treat first-line bevacizumab plus FOLFOX CapeOX ( TML BRiTE ) , cetuximab ( patient wild-type KRAS ) , panitumumab ( patient wild-type KRAS ) , aflibercept ( VELOUR ) . However , valid target agent could combine second line FOLFOX CapeOX progress first-line FOLFIRI without targeted agent ; bevacizumab beyond progression could valid treatment strategy receive first-line bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI . Higher dose bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg/2-week ) could combine FOLFOX second-line chemotherapy ; however , recommend present term cost effectiveness high adverse event , cetuximab plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy neither recommend current consensus . Thus , unmet need discovery valid target agent combination second-line FOLFOX reason .</detailed_description>
