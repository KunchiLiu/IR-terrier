	<brief_summary>This four-way , dose-response , crossover , double blind , placebo-controlled , randomised validation study investigate responsiveness MedDrive , compute battery neuropsychological task , different dos alcohol . The following hypothesis test : 1 . Measures MedDrive influence alcohol dose dependent way . 2 . Effects alcohol drive performance correlate measure MedDrive dose dependent way . 3 . Within group healthy young driver , MedDrive show consistent result repeat measure ( ICCâ‰¥0.7 ) . 4 . MedDrive model effect alcohol drive performance well UFOV trial make task .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : There increase need physician advice patient fitness drive . Current guideline underline limitation exist instrument poor adaptability battery neuropsychological test assess fitness drive experimental primary care setting . The investigator therefore develop MedDrive , free , reliable , computer base measure instrument capable detecting effect age drug cognitive function consider essential driving . Objectives : This study aim test MedDrive responsiveness different blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) validate measure performances drive simulator . It also aim measure MedDrive 's reliability follow repeated measure train phase , compare MedDrive 's performance measure effect different BAC UFOV , model MedDrives measure predict behaviour simulator . Finally , study also include nested experimental study measure effect alcohol attention . Methods : Using Widmark 's formula , 16 healthy young driver give cranberry juice different dos ethanol bring BAC 0 g/L , 0.5 g/L , 0.65 g/L , 0.8 g/L . They blind presence ethanol inhale vapor ethanol drink . BAC maintain entire experiment use breathalyser administrate drink throughout experiment . Three scenario plan drive simulator ( StSoftware PvW-2010 ) , road track task , car follow task , car follow task include dual tasking use peripheral vision .</detailed_description>
