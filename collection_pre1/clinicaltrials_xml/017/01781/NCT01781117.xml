	<brief_summary>Persistent detrusor overactivity ( DO ) transurethral prostatectomy result symptomatic failure one third patient . Storage symptom major complaint early postoperative period Holmium Laser Enucleation Prostate ( HoLEP ) . Levels urinary nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , produce bladder urothelium smooth muscle , increase patient overactive bladder ( OAB ) , decrease OAB symptom improve . Also , urinary NGF level increase patient benign prostatic obstruction ( BPO ) , change NGF level relief BPO medical surgical treatment fully investigate . If elevate urinary NGF level reduce successful surgical treatment BPO , measurement urinary NGF could useful objective tool ass therapeutic outcome operation . The aim study measure urinary NGF level patient BPO compare result patient detrusor overactivity ( DO ) without detrusor overactivity ( Non-DO ) , average 2 week Holmium Laser Enucleation Prostate ( HoLEP ) procedure . After HoLEP , urinary NGF level rechecked period postoperative 3 month 6 month , compare change two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Value Urinary Nerve Growth Factor Patients With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Investigators go enroll age-matched control group measure urinary NGF level baseline value ( 30 male ) . - Investigators go enroll BPO patient group ( DO group 50 Non-DO group 50 patient ) . - Administration anti-cholinergic agent report decrease urinary NGF level . Investigators go try avoid effect anti-muscarinic drug .</detailed_description>
