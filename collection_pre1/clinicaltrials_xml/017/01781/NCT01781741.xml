	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study stereotactic body radiation therapy surgery treat patient stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer . Stereotactic radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Lymphadenectomy may remove tumor cell spread nearby lymph node patient non-small cell lung cancer . Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy lymphadenectomy may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy After Surgery Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility/toxicity combine transcervical extend mediastinal lymphadenectomy ( TEMLA ) without video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time initiation chemotherapy follow TEMLA without video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) SBRT . II . To assess feasibility/toxicity combine TEMLA without VATS SBRT various chemotherapy regimen ( determine medical oncologist base patient tumor characteristic ) . III . To estimate survival follow TEMLA without VATS SBRT . IV . To define difference quality life/toxicity follow TEMLA without VATS SBRT base tumor location ( peripheral/central ) . V. To assess response primary tumor control overall survival TEMLA patient . VI . To assess progression free survival TEMLA without ( VATS ) patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo TEMLA remove mediastinal lymph node follow single fraction SBRT primary tumor ( unless VATS procedure do ) mediastinal lymph node bed ( positive TEMLA ) , without VATS . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6,9 , 12 month , every 6 month 2 year annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
