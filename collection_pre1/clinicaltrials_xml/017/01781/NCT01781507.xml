	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective : To compare acute bronchodilatory effect cetirizine 10 mg tablet nebulized levalbuterol use impulse oscillometry technique asthmatic subject age 18 65 year old allergic rhinitis show clinical evidence bronchial hyper-reactivity . Secondary Objective : To assess bronchodilatory effect cetirizine 10 mg tablet versus placebo two week therapy use impulse oscillometry technique subject 18 65 year old allergic rhinitis show clinical evidence bronchial hyper-reactivity . SUBJECT SELECTION : Inclusion Criteria - Age 18 65 year age - Physician diagnosis mild asthma base NIH guideline - Physician diagnosis allergic rhinitis confirm least 3+ skin test response least one allergen - Evidence abnormal , reversible airway function impulse oscillometry - Ability cooperate measurement impulse oscillometry Exclusion Criteria - Treatment inhaled oral corticosteroid within one month screen visit - Change dosage intranasal corticosteroid , oral anti- leukotrienes within one month screen visit . Subjects constant dose intranasal corticosteroid anti-leukotrienes one month allow study . - Known history reflux , lung disease , congenital heart disease - Known history adverse reaction cetirizine METHODS : General Design : This study , double-blinded , randomize , placebo- control study assess 1 ) acute bronchodilatory effect cetirizine 10 mg tablet compare levalbuterol 2 ) bronchodilatory effect cetirizine 10 mg compare placebo two week treatment . There minimum five total study visit . The study drug encapsulate methylcellulose placebo capsule methylcellulose alone . Visit Schedule : 1 . Initial Screening Visit On regularly schedule clinic day , follow completion sign informed consent study , first patient evaluation compose : ` History Physical Exam The subject 's demographic , medical , family , history record standardized questionnaire . All previous medication use treat allergic rhinitis record . Skin prick test use Multi-test method use test common environmental allergen . This standard procedure do evaluate patient clinical history suggestive allergic rhinitis take 15 minute initial prick interpretation result . As part standard assessment skin testing , patient ask take oral intranasal anti-histamines one week visit . Antihistamines mask histamine effect , subsequently positive skin test result . If interested participating study , ask remain antihistamines enrollment study determine . Allergens environmental panel test include cat , dust mite , weed mix , tree mix , grass mix , mold mix , saline , histamine . 2 . Second Screening Visit After withhold beta-agonist treatment least 6 hour , test baseline pulmonary function perform impulse oscillometry spirometry . They undergo impulse oscillometry technique guidance train technician . If subject is.able , he/she also perform spirometry oscillometry complete . If airway obstruction detect oscillometry , subject give levalbuterol hand-held nebulizer impulse oscillometry spirometry repeat 15 minute nebulizer treatment complete . If evidence reversibility ( i.e . lung function improvement ) , subject fulfil inclusion criterion ask continue study . 3 . First Study Visit The first study visit continuation second screen visit subject fulfil inclusion criterion evidence reversible airway obstruction follow levalbuterol treatment . The subject ask continue study period he/she repeat lung function test 15 , 30 , 60,90 , 120 , 180 , 240 minute treatment . Lung function test impulse oscillometry . If subject able , he/she perform spirometry 60 240 minute post-levalbuterol . Subjects instruct complete daily diary allergic rhinitis asthma symptom score . 4 . Second Study Visit ( 1 7 day First Study Visit ) All beta-agonist treatment need withhold least 6 hour prior visit . Baseline lung function test impulse oscillometry spirometry do . The subject give Cetirizine 10 mg tablet placebo . The subject coordinator blind study treatment . Lung function test assess impulse oscillometry . 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 minute cetirizine . Spirometry also perform 60 240 minute post.-cetirizine . Daily diary entry review subject . The subject send home study medication . He/she take 1 tablet study medication daily start day study visit . 5 . Third Study Visit ( 7 10 day Second Study Visit ) The subject take his/her usual study medication dose office . He/she perform impulse oscillometry , able , spirometry ass lung function . Daily diary entry review subject . The subject instruct continue take study medication dose regimen . 6 . Fourth Study Visit , ( 7 10 day Third Study Visit ) The subject take his/her usual study medication dose office . He/she perform impulse oscillometry spirometry ass lung function . Daily diary entry review subject . The subject instruct stop taking study medication continue put diary entry . 7 . Fifth Study Visit ( 7 10 day Fourth Study Visit ) The subject perform impulse oscillometry spirometry ass lung function . Daily diary entry review parent caregiver . Laboratory Studies : There laboratory study project .</detailed_description>
