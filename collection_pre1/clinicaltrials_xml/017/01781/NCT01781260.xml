	<brief_summary>Recent occurrence significant post-operative liver impairment Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust prompt investigation whether interaction general anaesthesia prone positioning ( lie face ) surgery influence liver function . Historical research show heart function efficiently anaesthetise patient place prone position surgery . The technique use anaesthetise monitoring patient change remarkably , since study first perform . It important know accurately heart function enable good understanding change blood flow liver prone position . Studies look blood flow liver lie face do mainly report patient intensive care unit . These intensive care patient different theatre undergoing routine surgery . The intensive care patient usually receive different type drug monitor several different type monitor time . Perhaps importantly place face soft air cushion mattress pillow rather rigid support use surgical patient . This study look whether function liver change patient anaesthetise roll onto front . The function liver measure look clear specific drug blood . Also study look accurate particular type heart monitor anaesthetise patient place onto front .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent occurrence significant post-operative hepatic dysfunction include two fatality Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust prompt investigation whether interaction general anaesthesia , prone positioning surgery , cardiac output use vasoactive drug influence hepatic function . Research show cardiac output decrease anaesthetised patient place supine prone position , magnitude change vary exact method physical patient support prone position.1-3 Anaesthetic technique method cardiac output monitoring use study longer routine use therefore may accurately reflect current practice balance anaesthesia current monitoring technique . The LiDCOplus minimally invasive cardiac output monitor use accurately calculate cardiac ouput associate derived variable ( stroke volume systemic vascular resistance ) . The LiDCOplus monitor use data already available arterial cannula routinely use monitoring patient circumstance . It calibrate use small ( 0.3mmol ) bolus dose lithium chloride . This technique show accurate safe even repeat calibration procedure short time period.4-6 Much evidence regard liver blood flow anaesthetise patient prone position critical care literature . There several difference group critically ill patient undergo prone position rescue therapy refractory hypoxia due acute lung injury healthy patient undergo elective surgery prone position . Critically ill patient multiple cardiovascular respiratory co-morbidities , usually receive infusion vasoactive drug generally position soft air cushion mattress pillow . Prone position patient seem significantly alter hepatic function measure hepatic Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) clearance.7 8 ICG fluorescent dye , absorb infra-red light rare ( 1:40 000 ) side effect profile . After intravenous injection almost exclusively eliminate hepatic excretion bile . The rate hepatic elimination show correlate accurately plasma disappearance rate measure transcutaneous infra-red absorbtion.9 It dynamic marker hepatic blood flow , hepatocellular function biliary excretion , short term variation think attributable change hepatic blood flow rather cellular dysfunction.10 The LiMON monitor use transcutaneous infra-red light absorption ( like pulse oximeter ) measure calculate value ICG plasma disappearance associate value clearance rate plasma retention rate . The technique involve intravenous injection small ( 0.25mg/kg ) bolus dose ICG . This repeat 20 time per 24hr period . It postulate simultaneously measure change hepatic blood flow cardiac output allow u gather great understand haemodynamic change associate prone position anaesthetise patient use current routine monitoring modality .</detailed_description>
