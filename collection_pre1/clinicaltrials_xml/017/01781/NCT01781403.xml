	<brief_summary>The investigator plan phase I study preoperative CRT capecitabine plus temozolomide inpatient locally advance resectable rectal cancer : 1 ) role temozolomide radiosensitizer well establish , 2 ) hypermethylation ( low expression ) MGMT promoter associate colorectal carcinogenesis , find 20~40 % colorectal cancer patient , proportion could adequate validation role predictive biomarker , 3 ) temozolomide additive synergistic radiotherapy essential treatment rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative CRT With Temozolomide Plus Capecitabine Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative chemoradiation ( CRT ) fluoropyrimidine ( 5-fluorouracil capecitabine ) regard standard treatment option patient locally advance resectable rectal cancer , pathologic response rate tumor regression grade preoperative CRT prove important prognostic factor survival outcome . Several study preoperative CRT fluoropyrimidines plus agent , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , cetuximab , bevacizumab , perform improve pathologic response rate ; however , fail show improved result compare fluoropyrimidine alone . Thus , fluoropyrimidine alone standard chemotherapeutic strategy patient locally advance resectable rectal cancer treat preoperative CRT present ; study need find effective combination improve pathologic response fluoropyrimidines alone patient population . Temozolomide oral alkylating agent , prove effective patient glioblastoma high grade anaplastic glioma administer concurrent radiotherapy either adjuvant recurrent setting , also seem effective patient malignant melanoma either monotherapy combination chemotherapy . Temozolomide known deplete O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) , one DNA repair enzyme , recent study show low expression ( immunohistochemistry ) hypermethylation ( methylation-specific PCR ) MGMT could predictive marker well response treatment temozolomide patient glioblastoma , high grade anaplastic glioma malignant melanoma . Silencing MGMT promoter hypermethylation know involve colorectal carcinogenesis pathway association KRAS mutation low-CIMP ( CpG island methylation phenotype ) , hypermethylation MGMT promoter could detect 29 % 46 % tumor tissue sporadic colorectal cancer patient . Nagasaka et al . show notable result MGMT promoter methylation status associate microsatellite instability hypermethylation MGMT promoter could predictive factor low recurrence colorectal cancer patient adjuvant oral fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy curative surgery . In addition , Shacham-Shmueli et al . show temozolomide could additional treatment option small group patient chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer lower MGMT expression .</detailed_description>
