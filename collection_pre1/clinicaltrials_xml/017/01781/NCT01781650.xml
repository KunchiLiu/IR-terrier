	<detailed_description>Introduction Water-aided method colonoscopy broadly subdivide two major category . Water Immersion ( WI ) characterize suction removal infused water predominantly withdrawal phase colonoscopy Water Exchange ( WE ) characterize suction removal infused water predominantly insertion phase colonoscopy . Several study show WE significantly reduce pain compare WI colonoscopy traditional air insufflation ( AI ) , increase number unsedated procedure adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) , particular proximal ADR . This randomize controlled trial direct comparison Air Insufflation , Water Immersion Water Exchange test hypothesis WAC ( particularly WE ) would significantly decrease pain score colonoscopy diagnostic patient . Several secondary outcome also analyze . Method Examinations allocate Water Exchange , Water Immersion Air Insufflation insertion phase colonoscopy base computer generate random list . Procedures start 6 board-certified endoscopists , three experience 8,000-10,000 three experience 2,000-5,000 colonoscopy AI , 285 WI 890 WE overall . High-resolution wide-angle variable-stiffness adult video colonoscope ( Olympus HD 180 series ; Olympus Corp , Hamburg , Germany ) use . Need change small caliber colonoscope consider ITT failure . Patients low volume split dose bowel preparation 2L polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) solution Sodium Picosulfate . Investigators blind colon preparation use . Before start procedure , questionnaire record demographic data , previous abdominal surgery , co-morbidities current medication administer endoscopists . The patient , endoscopists assist nurse , blind method use . At discharge patient ask guess method use . If half response correct , patient ' blinding consider adequate . Colonoscopy begin patient leave lateral position , without premedication . The withdrawal phase identical arm study use air insufflation obtain adequate distension colonic lumen mucosal inspection , biopsy and/or polypectomy . Patients randomize water-aided colonoscopy group , insertion phase reach rectosigmoid junction , colon irrigate water 37°C maintain water bath . Infusions perform use flush pump ( Olympus OFP2 , Olympus , Hamburg , Germany Velocity irrigation pump , US Endoscopy , OH , USA ) . There restriction overall volume water infuse get adequate lumen distention reach cecum . With patient leave lateral position water infuse colon rectal sigmoid junction flow descend colon . The weight water leave side colon straighten sigmoid segment increase ease insertion reduce risk loop formation . The air pump turn avoid inadvertent insufflation . Water Immersion involve infusion water insertion phase colonoscopy mainly open colonic lumen progress cecum immersed water environment thus create , without attempt clear colon content . Use water adjunct air insufflation facilitate insertion removal infused water predominantly withdrawal characteristic feature WI . This traditional adjunct facilitates passage sigmoid colon severe diverticulosis , speed arrival splenic flexure , decrease colonic spasm , minimize pain , even enhance cecal intubation previously incomplete colonoscopy . Residual air colon remove . The infused water residual feces suction back withdrawal . Air insufflation allow lumen see endoscopists judge unsafe advance colonoscope . It last 10 second record patient data sheet . If 3 episode air insufflation record procedure consider ITT failure . Water Exchange involve complete exclusion air insufflation , removal residual colonic air feces infuse water predominantly insertion assist identification lumen . WE minimize loop formation decrease discomfort . By provide salvage cleanse insertion , WE allow colonoscopist devote great proportion withdrawal inspection . WE involve infusion sufficient amount water open lumen colon allow passage instrument , thus render colonic lumen slit progress colonoscope . If lumen open , colonoscope slightly retract infusion start . Part infused water constantly suction back exchange clean dirty hazy water . Suction infused water also apply colonoscope insertion proceeds smoothly . Air pocket , encounter , always aspirate collapse lumen : absence air space force colonoscopist use water clear residual feces find way colon . Removal air also shorten colon take sharp turn flexure redundant segment , reduce risk loop formation : water instillation elongate colon much air insufflation . In collapsed , airless colon turbulence create tip instrument facilitate removal suction residual feces adherent mucosa . This provide salvage cleanse insertion phase . After cecal intubation much residual water possible aspirate begin withdrawal phase . During withdrawal scarce amount water leave aspirate , residual water feces suction . In AI group , colonoscopy perform standard fashion , allow wash need . In group abdominal compression position change apply need . Cecal intubation define passage tip colonoscope point proximal ileocecal valve adequate visualization cecum appendix orifice . A stopwatch use time procedure . Cecal intubation time define time passage colonoscope rectum cecum . The withdrawal phase last least 6 minute . Polyp resection do withdrawal group . Time polypectomy biopsy add total colonoscopy time . Pathology report polyp review record evaluate adenoma detection rate ( ADR , define proportion subject least one adenoma size ) , location , total number adenoma resect per subject ( ARR ) , percentage subject advance adenoma . The amount water infuse insertion withdrawal , number position change adverse outcome record . Cardiopulmonary function monitor . Significant oxygen desaturation ( &lt; 85 % &gt; 15 second ) record . Vagal reaction define heart rate &lt; 60 beat per minute accompany excessive sweating , nausea and/or vomiting .</detailed_description>
