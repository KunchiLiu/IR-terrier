	<brief_summary>Exertional dyspnea major source cripple distress hallmark symptom fibrotic interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) . Due scientific community 's poor understanding pathophysiological mechanism dyspnea therapeutic intervention consistently reduce dyspnea population . The investigator aim determine physiological mechanism exertional dyspnea patient fibrotic ILD impact hyperoxia exertional dyspnea exercise endurance . This study likely identify important physiological mechanism dyspnea fibrotic ILD may contribute development effective therapy reduce dyspnea population . The central hypothesis dyspnea fibrotic ILD primarily result imbalance drive breathe tidal volume response respiratory system ( i.e. , neuromechanical uncoupling ) experimental reduction neuromechanical uncoupling via hyperoxic breathe reduce exertional dyspnea improve exercise endurance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine physiological mechanism shortness breath ( dyspnea ) patient fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease ( ILD ) determine breathe supplemental oxygen manipulate mechanism improve dyspnea exercise capacity . The research question twofold : ( Aim 1 ) To determine physiological mechanism exertional dyspnea patient fibrotic ILD ; ( Aim 2 ) To determine effect hyperoxia exertional dyspnea exercise endurance patient fibrotic ILD . Experimental Overview : Participants fibrotic ILD control participant report exercise laboratory four separate occasion separate minimum 48 hour visit . On visit 1 , participant control participant complete medical history screening , chronic activity-related dyspnea questionnaire , anthropometric measurement , pulmonary function assessment , symptom limit incremental cycle exercise test familiarization purpose . On visit 2 , participant control participant perform pulmonary function test follow another incremental cycle exercise test . Detailed physiological sensory measurement obtain visit primary analysis base visit 2 result . Data visit 2 address Aim 1 . Visits 3 4 include pulmonary function test follow constant-load cycle exercise test 75 % peak incremental work rate breathing , randomize order , either room air hyperoxia ( 60 % oxygen ) . Participants control participant breathe hyperoxia visit 3 breathe room air visit 4 vice versa blind gas concentration . A multi-pair electrode catheter combine two balloon insert esophagus near infrared spectroscopy use measure tissue oxygenation visit 2 , 3 4 . Data visit 3 4 address Aim 2 . Measurements : - Pulmonary Function : simple spirometry , plethysmography , diffuse capacity , maximum respiratory pressure , static compliance recoil pressure perform visit 1 . Pulmonary function test visit 2-4 include spirometry plethysmography total lung capacity vital capacity obtain determination operate lung volume . - Dyspnea Evaluation : Dyspnea intensity perceive leg discomfort evaluate rest , every minute exercise , peak exercise use modify 10-point Borg scale test visit . Upon exercise cessation , subject ask verbalize main reason ( ) stop exercise ( i.e. , breathe discomfort , leg discomfort , combination breathe leg , reason ) select qualitative descriptor breathlessness use establish questionnaire . - Cardio-respiratory Responses Exercise : Standard cardio-respiratory measure , include minute ventilation , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production , partial pressure end-tidal carbon dioxide , tidal volume ( VT ) , breathe frequency . - Operating volume derive dynamic inspiratory capacity ( IC ) manoeuvre . Arterial oxygen saturation measure use pulse oximetry . Electrocardiography blood pressure monitor safety purpose . - Respiratory Mechanics : Diaphragmatic electromyography ( EMGdi ) measure use multi-pair electrode catheter combine two balloon measure esophageal gastric pressure . The ratio EMGdi EMGdimax use index neural respiratory drive . The ratio VT vital capacity ( VC ) use represent mechanical response respiratory system . Normalizing EMGdimax VC allow stimulus intensity standardize compare across individual . Thus neuromechanical uncouple respiratory system determine ratio ( interaction ) neural drive mechanical response respiratory system ( EMGdi/EMGdimax : VT/VC ) . - The mechanical work breathing ( WOB ) calculate area within ensemble averaged esophageal pressure-volume loop . Statistical Analysis : Aim 1 : Exercise-response slope ( e.g. , Borg/VO2 ) determine . Briefly , investigator obtain slope plot Borg vs. VO2 participant 's control participant 's incremental exercise test perform visit 2 . The investigator determine bivariate association Borg/VO2 slope VO2 slop neuromechanical uncoupling , drive breathe , VT response use Spearman correlation coefficient . The investigator force three predictor variable multivariate linear regression model Borg/VO2 slope outcome variable order identify independent association neuromechanical uncoupling exertional dyspnea . Variables transform approximate normal distribution necessary predictor variable reach statistical significance assess linear relationship outcome variable . Aim 2 : The investigator first use paired t-test identify change dyspnea exercise time compare room air breathe hyperoxia constant-load exercise test visit 3 4 . Multivariate model develop use between-test difference Borg dyspnea scale exercise time individual outcome variable . Predictor variable include between-test difference neuromechanical uncoupling individual component . Outcome predictor variable dyspnea outcome base between-test difference variable iso-time ( i.e. , maximum time patient exercise room air hyperoxia test ) . Predictor variable exercise time measure end test . As exploratory analysis , investigator repeat multivariate linear regression analysis IPF subgroup , investigator add categorical ILD subgroup variable analysis order identify inter-group difference . Additional adjustment potential confounders ( e.g. , sex , body mass index , high resolution compute tomography fibrosis score ) use exploratory analysis subgroup sample size sufficient . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant analysis . Data analysis perform use Stata v11.2 ( StataCorp , Texas , USA ) .</detailed_description>
