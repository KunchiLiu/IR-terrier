	<brief_title>Branched Chain Amino Acid Plus Glucose Supplement Reduces Exercise-Induced Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness College Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supplementation branch chain amino acid ( BCAAs ) use stimulate muscle protein synthesis follow exercise . The purpose study determine supplementation BCAAs combination glucose would reduce exercise-induced delay onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) . Using double-blind crossover design , 20 subject ( 11 female , 9 male ) randomly assign either BCAA ( n=10 ) placebo ( n=10 ) group . Subjects perform squat exercise elicit DOMS rat muscle soreness every 24 hour four day follow exercise continue consume BCAA placebo . Following three-week recovery period , subject return received alternate BCAA placebo treatment , repeat exercise DOMS rating protocol next four day . BCAA supplementation female subject result significant decrease DOMS versus placebo 24 hour follow exercise ( p = 0.018 ) . No significant effect BCAA supplementation versus placebo note male subject , male female result analyze together . This gender difference may relate dose per body weight difference male female subject .</detailed_description>
