	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine outcome ( death , myocardial infarction , target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) , non-target vessel revascularization ( non-TVR ) , stent-thrombosis ) 120 consecutive patient ST elevation myocardial infarction multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing multivessel stenting stag percutaneous coronary intervention Zotarolimus-eluting stent</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multivessel Stenting Versus Staged Revascularization With Zotarolimus-eluting Stent STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multivessel coronary artery disease report occur 40 67 % ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient . Multivessel coronary artery disease ( MVCD ) patient , experience STEMI , high risk major cardiovascular event ( MACE ) within one year primary PCI . While MACE incidence patient one-vessel coronary artery disease 14.5 % , patient two- three-vessel lesion experience MACE 19.5 % 23.6 % case , respectively . The risk death 5-year follow-up increase two-fold MVCD patient . This risk partly explain slow recovery leave ventricular function progression leave ventricular pathological remodel process MI . In addition , mere presence MVCD show associated MACE development long-term period . There several treatment strategy ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient MVCD : infarct related artery ( IRA ) -only percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , multivessel stenting primary PCI set stag revascularisation . The current guideline STEMI revascularisation give definite instruction need concurrent non-IRA intervention patient stable haemodynamics . At present , clinical trial test current Zotarolimus-eluting stent ( ZES ) STEMI patient MVCD undergo primary PCI different strategy revascularization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must least 18 year age . Subject able verbally confirm understandings risk , benefit treatment either multivessel stenting stag PCI use zotarolimuseluting stent ( Resolute Integrity™ Stent , Medtronic ) legally authorize representative provide write informed consent prior study related procedure . Subject must significant stenosis ( ≥ 70 % ) two two coronary artery require primary PCI acute ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) within 12hrs Target lesion ( ) must locate native coronary artery visually estimate diameter le 2.5 mm 4.0 mm . Target lesion ( ) must amenable percutaneous coronary intervention The patient know hypersensitivity contraindication follow medication : Heparin Aspirin Both Clopidogrel Ticlopidine , Zotarolimus Female childbearing potential , unless recent pregnancy test negative , possibly plan become pregnant time enrollment study . An elective surgical procedure plan would necessitate interruption thienopyridines first 6 month post enrollment . Noncardiac comorbid condition present life expectancy 1 year may result protocol noncompliance ( per site investigator 's medical judgment ) . Acute heart failure Killip IIIIV ≥ 50 % leave main stenosis</criteria>
