	<brief_summary>The investigator recently develop paediatric adaptation INTERMED tool address unique developmental social context child youth . The Pediatric INTERMED adopt life-chart methodology structure organize complex case material time , colour-coding domain facilitate identification area high need risk patient . The focus present study examine characteristic usefulness tool identify psychosocial stress children/youth diagnose Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) , well identify overall case complexity . Children parent participate semi-structured structured interview clinical nurse rate 34-PIM item . To examine construct validity Pediatric INTERMED domain ( biological , psychological , social , caregiver/family , health care system ) participants complete questionnaire assess social psychological functioning , parent family stress , quality life adaptive functioning . Information disease status , health care utilization obtain medical chart review . It hypothesize great case complexity predictive complex disease course/treatment , poor quality life , increase health care utilization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Pediatric Intermed : A New Clinical Decision Making Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( Crohn 's disease/ulcerative colitis ) manifest child adolescent 1/3 eventually develop condition . It fast become increase problem 50 % increase Crohn 's disease diagnose young child last decade . The patient 's chronic symptom due result increase child family psychosocial stress . Similarly , treatment may add psychosocial stress . Failure address psychosocial issue lead great risk poor treatment adherence , high utilization health care , increase psychiatric co-morbidity . As , improvement health care provider ' capacity identify factor contribute case complexity offer significant potential improving outcome . Assessment biological , psychological , social health delivery child 's chronic illness consistently integrate health care system . Physical mental health service often disconnect . Identifying would benefit mental health referral typically rest primary care physician specialist often triggered crisis . There also variability physician education comfort level assess psychosocial issue especially child chronic illness symptoms physical disease mental health overlap . Oftentimes leave responsible physician want simple assessment tool try determine might risk benefit mental health intervention . The adult INTERMED clinical decision-support tool provide indicator biological , psychological , social , heath care need , well overall index case complexity . The tool efficient administer successfully use varied health care professional diverse medical setting detect psychosocial need , facilitate referral effective service improve health practice outcomes . However , comparable validated tool use children/youth . The investigator recently develop pediatric adaptation adult INTERMED address unique developmental social context child youth . A Delphi group international expert field pediatric chronic illness review instrument ensure clinical relevance , utility communication clarity . Initial pilot data demonstrate Pediatric INTERMED good item inter-rater reliability . The focus current study examine usefulness tool identify biopsychosocial need IBD children/youth . Canada high IBD incidence prevalence . Given fact child IBD face unpredictable disease course , complex symptom difficult management regimens significantly impact life , surprising patient chronic incurable condition highly vulnerable mental health comorbidities . The development new tool significant importance prove useful population . The current study examine sizeable cohort patient regard relation Pediatric INTERMED domains measure child 's disease , mood , behaviour , quality life , family stress strength , health service utilization . Both ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease child youth lend well study validate measure disease severity develop already . Implementation novel Pediatric INTERMED n clinical practice provide new way assist IBD Teams screen patient proactive referral mental health resource , facilitate case management target patient need . Clearly , clinician well aware compliance , anxiety depression affect disease outcomes often dealt time crisis lead disease flare report medicine longer effective . Use structured assessment tool begin realize potential develop truly integrated biopsychosocial approach chronic disease . The ease use objective nature tool enhance communication among primary tertiary provider contribute best practice approach provision integrate physical mental health care . It also assist monitor impact childhood chronic illness , identify factor link optimal health outcome inform program planning resource allocation . Study Design Children/youth ( age 8-17 ) follow IBD Clinic Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario ( CHEO ) confirm diagnosis IBD ( Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) eligible study . A clinical nurse complete Pediatric INTERMED study participant : base information obtain review patient ' hospital chart semi-structured interview conduct child/youth primary caregiver ) , Following Pediatric INTERMED interview , children/youth parent participate project complete battery self-report instrument provide assessment patient ' social psychological functioning , parent/family stress , adjustment resource . In addition , information obtain patient ' chart aspect diagnosis , treatment regimen , disease activity complication , health care utilization 3 month prior participation study . Primary Hypotheses/Objectives Statistical Rationale 1 . Demonstrate Pediatric INTERMED reliable tool use IBD child ( good inter-rater reliability internal consistency ) . 40 interview clinical research nurse videotape second health care professional train use PIM , also complete PIM tool , order examine inter-rater reliability . Agreement raters measure mean intraclass correlation . Items within domain examine confirm meet internal consistency criterion ( Cronbach 's Alpha .80 ) . 2 . Demonstrate Pediatric INTERMED domains successfully identify patient need . Concurrent validity Pediatric INTERMED examine look Spearman rank , Pearson correlation , appropriate , domain score measure hypothesize conceptually link domain . To assess aspect Psychological Domain , patient complete Children 's Depression Inventory , Multidimensional Anxiety Scale Children parent complete Child Behaviour Checklist ( CBCL ) . Measures link Social Domain PIM , include The Functional Disability Inventory , tap child 's involvement daily activity , CBCL Competence Scores ( Social , School , Activities ) , IMPACT-III , IBD specific quality life measure . To examine construct link Caregiver/Family Domain parent complete Pediatric Inventory Parents , index childhood illness-related parenting stress , Family Inventory Life Events Changes Family Inventory Resources Management . Disease/treatment health care data gather used validate Biological Health System Domains . 3 . Demonstrate Pediatric INTERMED Complexity score predictive increase health care utilization . A general linear approach use study relation Pediatric INTERMED health service utilization . Multivariate model also test include potential covariates disease severity , time since diagnosis . Statistical Power Calculations The CHEO GI clinic see 40 60 new patient diagnose IBD per year . In 2007 clinic actively follow 265 child IBD . Once diagnosed child follow ongoing basis . The frequency follow-up appointment varies depend nature course child 's disease , children/youth see minimum three time year . In general , participation rate study children/youth chronic illness typically vicinity 80-90 % good figure consistent experience CHEO IBD clinic recruitment patient various knowledge generation study . The PIM involve 5 domain information inclusive various component . To achieve significance various domain investigator estimate total 140-150 child need enrol . This sample size sufficient ensure sufficient number observation per variable conduct multivariate analysis . Tabachnick Fidell ( 2007 ) others indicate 4 absolute minimum number observation per variable conduct multivariate analysis . A subject size 140-150 would sufficient provide 4 observation per variable . Further , anticipate sample size sufficient conduct propose analysis . Further correction multiple test applied per-analysis basis .</detailed_description>
