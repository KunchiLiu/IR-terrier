In current medical practice , difficult PT determine patient fail recover expect . By record exercise perform home , IBEHR provide monitoring data informs PT whether patient adhere poorly prescribe exercise frequency duration , patient perform exercise incorrectly , PT prescribe wrong exercise . Our Specific Aims 1 ) develop IBEHR software , 2 ) perform alpha test device accuracy beta test user interface ease use , 3 ) perform preliminary evaluation efficacy IBEHR improve adherence .
