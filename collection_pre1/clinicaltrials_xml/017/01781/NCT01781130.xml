	<brief_summary>Background Present treatment strategy trigger finger conservative management include steroid injection fail include percutaneous open A1 pulley release , people show prolonged swell delay complete healing . We aim test hypothesis improve outcome achieve employ steroid injection simultaneously percutaneous release compare conventional percutaneous release alone Methods We design double-blind , randomize control trial . Inclusion criteria patient symptom trigger finger warrant surgical release sufficient time conservative treatment . Exclusion criterion follow : 1 ) multiple finger presentation ; 2 ) Rheumatoid arthritis patient ; 3 ) Pregnant lactate patient ; 4 ) Younger 18 year old ; 5 ) Previous surgery history finger 6 ) ; patient get steroid injection 4 time previously ; 7 ) coagulation abnormality include usage anti-thrombotic agent . After power analysis statistician , total 40 patient would require group ( percutaneous alone group versus percutaneous alone + steroid injection group ) . The surgery perform outpatient clinic basis local injection . Additional steroid injection give half patient allocation randomize selection permutaed block randomization . Primary outcome measure mean fall pain visual analogue scale ( pVAS ) secondary outcome proportion patient good response ( define `` Perfect '' `` much good '' report patient ) . Follow-up conduct 3 week 3 month index procedure</brief_summary>
