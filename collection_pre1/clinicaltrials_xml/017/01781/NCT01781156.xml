	<brief_summary>Hyperphosphatemia elevate cardiac biomarkers two key characteristic patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , however majority absence acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . And still unclear cardiac biomarkers would increase patient . We hypothesize excessive phosphorus account phenomenon.To confirm hypothesis , use one phosphorus binder reduce phosphorus absorption hemodialysis patient time observed change cardiac biomarkers patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Reducing Phosphorus Absorption Cardiac Biomarkers Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease one leading cause morbidity mortality patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , account 50 % deaths.When myocardial cell get injure , cardiac biomarkers release circulation . Elevated cardiac biomarkers observe patient various degree renal failure . However , majority CKD patient absence acute coronary syndrome . So far , still unclear mechanism increase biomarkers CKD patient . Meanwhile , hyperphosphatemia one major feature CKD , particularly end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Lots evidence show high level serum phosphorus elevation serum calcium Ã— phosphorus product lead cardiovascular calcification subsequent cardiovascular morbidity mortality patient CKD.it tempt hypothesize hyperphosphatemia may responsible rise cardiac biomarkers CKD patients.So use one phosphate binder reduce phosphorus absorption hemodialysis patient one year observe change cardiac biomarkers patient .</detailed_description>
