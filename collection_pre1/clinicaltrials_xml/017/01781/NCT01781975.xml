	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) result autoimmune destruction insulin-producing ß cell . Although exogenous insulin widely available , possible affected individual consistently achieve euglycemia current technology , thus risk devastate long-term complication . This phase II study design evaluate safety efficacy imatinib mesylate novel therapy new-onset T1DM . Imatinib first-in-class tyrosine kinase inhibitor . This study explore potential role short-term therapy imatinib induce tolerance possibly lead durable long-term remission T1DM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible participant randomize receive either imatinib mesylate placebo daily . All participant randomize study see study site follow-up evaluation , 2 week 4 week randomization , every month month thereafter first year . Participants come visit ever 6 month second year . At study visit , participant undergo assessment insulin production , immunologic status , overall health . Subjects follow conclusion study . The trial expect last approximately 2-4 year require amount information gather .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female age 1245 year age meet ADA standard T1DM criteria1 . Positive least one islet cell autoantibody . Initial enrollment subject age 1845 , goal low age 12 upon acceptable safety review prospect benefit initial old cohort . Diagnosis T1DM within 100 day Visit 0 . Peak stimulate Cpeptide level &gt; 0.2 pmol/mL follow MMTT . Participants childbearing age sexually active must agree use effective form birth control ( e.g. , barrier method , oral contraception , surgery ) . For female , contraceptive measure must maintain throughout study ; male measure must follow minimum 3 month discontinuation imatinib therapy . Prior history significant cardiac disease congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , arrhythmia , structural defect suspicion thereof . Leukopenia ( &lt; 3,000 leukocytes/μL ) , neutropenia ( &lt; 1,500 neutrophils/μL ) , thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 125,000 platelets/μL ) . Low Hemoglobin ( baseline hemoglobin lower limit normal ) Prior history anaphylaxis , angioedema serious cutaneous drug reaction Any sign significant chronic active infection ( e.g. , hepatitis , tuberculosis , EBV , CMV , toxoplasmosis ) , screen laboratory evidence consistent significant chronic active infection ( positive HIV , PPD , HBSAg ) . Significant acute infection must resolve treatment may commence , e.g. , acute respiratory tract , urinary tract , gastrointestinal tract infection . Anticipated ongoing use diabetes medication insulin affect glucose homeostasis , metformin , sulfonylurea , thiazolidinediones , glucagonlike peptide 1 ( GLP1 ) mimetics , dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPPIV ) inhibitor , amylin . Prior current treatment know cause significant , ongoing change course T1DM immunologic status , include highdose inhale , extensive topical systemic glucocorticoid . Evidence liver dysfunction , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 2.0 time upper limit normal persistent 1 week great . Evidence renal insufficiency indicate serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 time upper limit normal confirm repeat test least one week apart . Evidence clinically significant metabolic bone disease ( except adequately treat rickets ) . Females pregnant time screen unwilling defer pregnancy 24month study period . Prior treatment imatinib relate tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Unable avoid medication affect CYP3A4 : either inducer may decrease imatinib level , inhibitor may increase drug concentration . ( Refer section 1.5.1.12 complete list inducer inhibitor . ) Height standard deviation score ≥2 standard deviation mean Any sign QT prolongation Visit 1 note ECG ( &gt; 450 m male &gt; 470 ms female ) Known coagulation disorder use anticoagulant Current anticipate ongoing treatment drug may increase decrease imatinib plasma concentration ( CYP3A4 family inhibitor inducer ) drug may plasma concentration alter imatinib ( drug metabolize CYP3A4/5 CYP2D6 ) . Any condition , investigator 's opinion , may compromise study participation may confound interpretation study result .</criteria>
