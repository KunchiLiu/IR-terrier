	<brief_title>Phase I Dose-Escalation , Safety , Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Study BVD-523 Patients With Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform assess safety tolerability BVD-523 In Part 1 study , accelerate dose escalation plan use establish dose limit toxicity , maximum tolerate dose , recommend Phase 2 dose . In Part 2 study , additional patient particular tumor type and/or cancer harbor specific genetic mutation recruit treatment Recommended Phase 2 Dose . Patients may also assessed pharmacodynamic measure healthy malignant tissue , use biomarker assay phosphorylation , cytotoxic cytostatic measure .</detailed_description>
