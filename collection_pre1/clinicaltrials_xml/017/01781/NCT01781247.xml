	<detailed_description>Background Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) mental disorder may occur someone experience traumatic event . Between 10-20 % patient may develop PTSD response traumatic experience myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Sociodemographic psychosocial variable , include perceived distress MI , identify `` risk factor '' development posttraumatic stress aftermath MI . PTSD associate impaired quality life , social functioning , high economic burden society . Posttraumatic stress attributable MI also show predictive poor cardiovascular prognosis , whereby link might relate atherothrombotic process like endothelial dysfunction , dyslipidemia , inflammation , coagulation . Therefore prevention PTSD MI high relevance . Guidelines publish early intervention prevent development posttraumatic stress different type trauma . A recent systematic review meta-analysis randomize controlled trial early psychological intervention design prevent symptom PTSD find benefit , treatment provide symptomatic individual trauma-focused . The impact intervention posttraumatic stress response myocardial infarction assess far . The planned project first test , development posttraumatic stress successfully prevent MI patient high risk develop PTSD minimal behavioral intervention feasible . Objective Primary aim : The overarch aim plan project investigate randomized-controlled trial whether minimal ( single counseling session 45 minute plus information booklet ) early-on ( within 48 hour myocardial infarction ) administer behavioral intervention reduces development clinician-rated posttraumatic stress level attributable MI patient high risk develop clinically relevant level posttraumatic stress . Secondary aim : A aim investigate whether behavioral intervention improve psychosocial functioning favorably affect cardiometabolic risk marker . Methods Patients consider `` high risk '' develop posttraumatic stress randomize one single counseling session 45 minute ( either target specific MI-triggered traumatic reaction general information role psychological stress coronary heart disease ) . The session perform study therapist coronary care unit within 48 hour patient reach stable circulatory condition . Each patient additionally receive write study material form information booklet . Medical variable , sociodemographic factor cardiometabolic biomarkers also determine . At 3-month 12-month follow-up patient assess interviewer-rated posttraumatic stress level , psychosocial functioning , biomarkers .</detailed_description>
