	<detailed_description>Early identification undiagnosed HIV infection remain critical public health priority . In United States , approximately 250,000 HIV-infected individual remain undiagnosed 50,000 new infection occur annually , despite several substantial HIV-related public health initiative . Although HIV test important intervention , controversy still exist implement . In 2006 , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) recommend nontargeted opt-out HIV screen clinical setting undiagnosed prevalence â‰¥0.1 % . Emergency department ( EDs ) major focus recommendation , prompt fact 120 million ED visit occur annually United States , serve large proportion underserved patient , common site miss diagnostic opportunity HIV infection . In contrast , 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend target HIV screening ( i.e. , test high-risk subpopulation ) principal approach HIV test insufficient evidence exist support CDC recommendation . Led Jason Haukoos , MD , MSc , research team pioneer investigation area since 2004 , recently publish large clinical trial date , conclude nontargeted opt-out rapid HIV screen ED associate small increase number newly-identified HIV-infected patient compare diagnostic testing ( i.e. , test base clinical sign symptom ) physician . The investigator also recently develop Denver HIV Risk Score ( DHRS ) , first multivariable tool estimate risk HIV infection . The DHRS combine 3 demographic 5 behavioral characteristic , classifies patient distinct stratum increase HIV prevalence . To build work , investigator propose follow specific aim : ( 1 ) evaluate compare effectiveness 3 rapid HIV screen strategy fully-integrated ED care ; ( 2 ) measure compare programmatic cost HIV screen strategy ; ( 3 ) measure compare ED operational process HIV screen strategy . In , investigator perform multi-center prospective randomize control trial test follow hypothesis : ( 1 ) target rapid HIV screen use DHRS identify high-risk patient significantly associate new HIV diagnosis compare traditional target rapid HIV screening nontargeted rapid HIV screening ; ( 2 ) enhance traditional targeted rapid HIV screen cost effective per newly-identified patient nontargeted rapid HIV screening ; ( 3 ) enhance target rapid HIV screening associate non-inferior ED process metric crowd compare traditional targeted screening nontargeted screening . To accomplish aim , investigative team conduct : ( 1 ) prospective randomize control `` pragmatic '' clinical effectiveness trial EDs Denver Health Medical Center ( Denver , CO ) , Alameda County Medical Center ( Oakland , CA ) , Johns Hopkins Hospital ( Baltimore , MD ) , University Cincinnati Medical Center ( Cincinnati , OH ) ; ( 2 ) nest observational study evaluate programmatic cost operational metric 3 rapid HIV screening strategy use newly-diagnosed HIV infection primary outcome .</detailed_description>
