	<brief_summary>Escalating resistance antibiotic among disease-causing community bacteria increasingly threaten ability treat patient ' infection . At level physician-patient encounter , incentives patient level often take priority society ; often case antibiotic prescribing . Each patient level antibiotic treatment decision base value potential outcome , include short-term benefit risk longer-term risk , include related future bacterial resistance antibiotic . Unfortunately , antibiotic often prescribed illness unlikely bacterial etiology ; even small likelihood benefit seem outweigh increase risk future antibiotic resistance . While short-term effect antibiotic colonization resistant bacteria demonstrate , overall implication treatment future individual , family societal-level resistance remain difficult quantify , often steeply discount ignored decision-making . Knowledge regard longer-term effect personal household antibiotic use could better quantify future resistance-related risk , help guide antibiotic decision-making physician patient . Infants bear sterile nasopharyngeal gastrointestinal tract yet , 1st year life , become important reservoir resistant organism ; create opportunity study colonization resistance start microbiological tabula rasa . In proposal , use observational cohort follow newborn ' antibiotic exposure longitudinal colonization specific bacterial pathogen relate antibiotic resistance 1st year life . Our hypothesis 1st year life , infant personal household antibiotic exposure great colonization resistan organisms infant without antibiotic exposure . This project help u understand development bacteria resistant antibiotic within community , help inform judicious decision-making regard antibiotic prescribing .</brief_summary>
