	<brief_summary>The course pulmonary embolism ( PE ) one relevant late complication , i.e . chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) still substantially unknown . Recent evidence show incidence CTEPH high previously believe , confirm study . A clear link PE CTEPH question expert . A great number patient affect PE persistently residual chronic thromboembolic material meaning matter debate . The evidence sustain link chronic residual PE subsequent PE recurrences CTEPH insufficient . Thus , nationwide , multicentre , prospective cohort study design follow aim : 1. ascertain incidence symptomatic CTEPH first episode acute PE ; 2. ascertain incidence venous thromboembolic ( VTE ) recurrences first episode acute PE ; 3. evaluate whether relation exist chronic residual PE CTEPH 4. evaluate whether relation exist chronic residual PE VTE recurrences ; 5. evaluate whether relation exists persistent right ventricular dysfunction CTEPH ; 6. evaluate whether relation exists persistent right ventricular dysfunction PE recurrence . For enrol centre , consecutive outpatient inpatient objectively diagnose first acute PE episode consider eligible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Clinical Course Of Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient enrol study receive diagnosis PE mean chest CT scan , lung scan pulmonary angiography . All patient undergo echocardiographic examination acute phase PE , possible . All patient treat accord current international guideline local protocol . All survive patient receive echocardiographic examination 6 week 6 month . All survive patient receive perfusional pulmonary scintigraphy 6 month subsequently follow every 6 month least 3 year . In case clinical suspicion VTE recurrence diagnostic procedure perform order confirm recurrent VTE episode ( Chest CT scan , lung scan , Pulmonary angiography , compressive ultrasound , phlebography , vein CT scan ) . In case clinical suspicion CTEPH , diagnostic workup perform , consist echocardiography , ventilation/perfusion lung scanning , multidetector chest CT scanning , pulmonary angiography , direct measurement pulmonary-artery pressure . The extension pulmonary embolism acute phase grade accord standardize scoring system local investigator extension chronic residual pulmonary embolism grade accord standardize scoring system ( Meyer score ) local investigator independent committee . All outcome event centrally adjudicate independent committee . All clinical data ( initial data medical history , clinical symptom , presence risk factor , diagnosis , diagnostic test result , treatment type duration , outcome event ) collect local investigator electronic medical database . Related data send coordinate centre regular basis . All recruiting centre regularly monitor coordinating Centre .</detailed_description>
