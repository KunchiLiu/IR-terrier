	<brief_summary>This study multicenter , randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled clinical study . All group receive standard intensive diabetes treatment insulin life style management . 60 subject randomly assign 1:1:1 ratio receive placebo different dosage GABA . GABA amino acid produce glutamate glutamic acid decarboxylase . It approve treatment hepatic coma , fibromyalgia , ataxia China widely use supplement treatment epilepsy , insomnia , stress tobacco dependence . It recently show GABA prevent reverse development diabetes type 1 mouse model . Participants receive placebo GABA 52 week . The study consist 4 week screen period , 2 week run-in period , 52 week treatment period 4 week follow-up period . Enrollment expect occur 2 year . To assess efficacy safety GABA treatment juvenile type 1 diabetes new onset subject .</brief_summary>
