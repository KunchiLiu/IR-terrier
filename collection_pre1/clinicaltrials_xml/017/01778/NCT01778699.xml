	<detailed_description>2 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY In previous study efficacy Lb CD2 interim covariates related caries development test . So , decide plan new study schoolchildren area . The aim present research protocol evaluate anticariogenic effect probiotic daily use , caries development child . The null hypothesis probiotic Lb CD2 would modify caries risk child . Moreover , study carry investigate plaque acidogenicity situ follow regular consumption probiotic product compare control group . 3 STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective : The regular consumption probiotic lead significantly low caries increment compare placebo . Regular oral hygiene permit . Target criterion : Efficacy : Lower caries increment Safety : Determination side effect Safety : Determination side effect Side effect especially change oral mucosa consumption product . 4 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Study design study centre Double blind , placebo-controlled , longitudinal study 440 test subject . The study carry single centre Department Surgery , Microsurgery Medical Sciences -School Dentistry University Sassari , Viale San Pietro 43/C Sassari . The planned duration study January-February 2013 March 2015 ( Final Report ) . Proposed start recruitment test subject January-February 2013 . 5 TEST SUBJECTS 440 healthy male female chidren test subject . These recruit primary school Sassari . 5.1 Concomitant treatment permit In general , probiotic-containing product , except dairy product . 5.2 Permitted concomitant medication All medication allow . However , 30 day prior screen phase entire study period , must enter case report form `` Concomitant Medication '' section . 5.3 Criteria premature termination study individual test subject . Reasons may give premature withdrawal individual test subject : - Retraction consent - If continue participation study longer acceptable justified important medical ground assess investigator - Occurrence intolerable side effect ( SE ) assess investigator - Violation protocol , accord decision investigator , reason give write - Non-attendance test subject - Lack compliance motivation part test subject ( e.g . wear intra-oral specimen holder six hour day ) Test subject withdraw study prematurely subject final examination . The reason withdrawal study date must record investigator case report form . 5.4 Criteria discontinue entire study In particular , recognition new information and/or risk require benefit/risk ratio reassess . In case negative outcome , LKP may discontinue study discussion principal investigator sponsor . If inadequate recruitment persistent recurrent serious objection trial protocol , sponsor , agreement LKP discussion principal investigator , may decide terminate study prematurely administrative reason . Should premature termination study unavoidable , measure must decide upon introduce protect interest well-being test subject far possible . 6 STUDY PRODUCTS 6.1 Test product placebo The test product study manufacture provided CD Investments srl , Italy . The placebo lozenges look like active lozenge taste weight 1 gram contain ingredient list proportion active L. brevis CD2 . It possible differentiate two product . The study center monitor must inform deficiency study product ( product keep 4° degree study ) . 6.2 Standard toothpaste toothbrush Standard toothpaste contain fluoride : monofluorophosphate contain toothpaste ( 800/1000 ppm ) 6.3 Packaging label 6.3.1 Test product Before use , investigator store test sample 4° degree temperature . For subject one container study medication study period deliver , well one replacement container case . The test samplesy produce supplied CD investiments ( Italy ) cod either 'green ' 'red ' . The code seal independent monitor , broken statistical analysis finalize . 6.4 Determination compliance 6.4.1 Test medication The container weigh study period . 6.4.2 Standard toothpaste The test subject must use standard toothpaste throughout study . A check make compliance question test subject . 6.5 Documentation whereabouts test sample The investigator record whereabouts test sample inventory . Delivery note notice return sign investigator . 7 DOSAGE In treatment phase subject use 2 losanges day . 8 STUDY SCHEDULE AND TEST METHODS 8.1 Study schedule 8.1.1 Planned schedule Prior start study , demographic , ethnic prognostic data collect ( screen phase ) . A medical history take , documentation previous concomitant treatment clinical examination oral cavity ( dental status , oral mucosa ) perform investigator . If test subject meet inclusion criterion without fulfil exclusion criterion , he/she enrol clinical trial give test subject identification number . All test subject receive patient diary screening phase . Individual specimen holder prepare test subject . Period 1 : ( 180 day ) consumption study product , regular oral hygiene At start period ICDAS score record plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci . All subject instruct oral hygiene consumption study product . At 90th day plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci also record . Period 2 : ( 90 day ) regular oral hygiene plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci record . Period 3 : ( 180 day ) consumption study product , regular oral hygiene At start period ICDAS score record plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci . All subject instruct oral hygiene consumption study product . At 90th day plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci also record . Period 4 : ( 90 day ) regular oral hygiene plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci record . Period 5 : ( 180 day ) consumption study product , regular oral hygiene At start period ICDAS score record plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci . All subject instruct oral hygiene consumption study product . At 90th day plaque pH salivary mutans streptococci also record . 9 MATERIALS AND METHODS 9.1 Clinical parameter ICDAS ( International Caries Detection Assessment System ) index , Oral mucosa 9.2 Investigation saliva factor Saliva factor pH flow rate measure screen phase three day , time morning . The mean three measurement calculate . The Dentobuff® test kit ( Vivadent , Liechtenstein ) use . 9.3 Teeth brushing technique Test subject require clean teeth minimum two time day fluoride-containing toothpaste soft toothbrush . During time , fresh , damp gauze ( soaked water ) place container day order provide moist atmosphere appliance . The specimen allow dry . The enamel specimens likewise carefully clean soft toothbrush except last day every period . 9.4 Randomization Using computer program ( Excel 2010 Mac OsX ) , randomization carry individual basis . 9.5 Application study product The subject allow chew lozenge . They allow swallow lozenge . 9.6 Plaque-pH evaluation At end phase plaque acidogenicity assess use MicroTouch technique previous sucrose challenge . Evaluations pH carry specimen . The pH measure quintuplicate 6 different time point : baseline ( sucrose rinse ) 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 30 min 1-min rinse 10 ml 10 % sucrose , use active movement . An iridium touch microelectrode ( diameter 0.1 mm ; Beetrode NMPH-1 , World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , Fla. , USA , porous glass reference electrode ( MERE 1 , World Precision Instruments ) use . A salt bridge create KCl ( 3 M ) solution reference electrode finger subject . Before session pH evaluation , electrode calibrate use buffer solution pH 7.00 4.00 .</detailed_description>
