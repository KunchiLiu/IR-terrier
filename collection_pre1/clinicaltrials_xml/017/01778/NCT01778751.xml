	<brief_title>Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care Veterans With Poorly-Controlled Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Although effort VA provider researcher improve diabetes care quality Veterans , individual persistent poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 diabetes hemoglobin A1c &gt; 9.0 % &gt; 1 year despite receipt medical care ) proven refractory widespread improvement , remain high risk complication accrue cost . Prior research illustrate medication regimen complexity , suboptimal self-care , comorbid depressive symptom interact perpetuate suboptimal control among individual PPDM . Current model clinic-based diabetes care meet Veterans ' need . Without implementation care delivery strategy target population 's unique barrier improve diabetes control , Veterans continue leave behind progress diabetes management throughout VA , remain high risk complication high cost . We propose use exist local Home Telehealth service implement Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care , patient-centered , evidence-based intervention combine medication management , self-care behavior support , depressive symptom management Veterans PPDM . Objectives : The specific aim RRP : 1 ) evaluate effectiveness Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care among Veterans persistent poorly-controlled diabetes ; 2 ) utilize mixed method formative evaluation ass main implementation strategy , use exist Home Telehealth service administer intervention ; 3 ) generate data use refine local intervention implementation inform development SDP proposal evaluate broad implementation Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care intervention . Methods : We propose pilot Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid trial study Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care intervention Veterans persistent poorly-controlled diabetes . After baseline evaluation , 50 Veterans randomly assign intervention ( n = 25 ) control group ( n = 25 ) . Veterans randomized intervention enrol Home Telehealth program Durham VAMC receive study intervention ( telehealth-based medication management , self-care behavior support , depressive symptom management ) 6 month . Intervention-group Veterans depression baseline assessment initially receive depressive symptom management component , monitor new symptom throughout study . Veterans randomize control arm receive diabetes educational material management per primary provider . The primary effectiveness outcome study hemoglobin A1c . Secondary effectiveness outcome include measure diabetes self-care , self-reported medication adherence , depressive symptom . This RRP also include mixed method formative evaluation qualitatively quantitatively assess patient-level , provider-level , organizational barrier facilitator influence intervention implementation . Formative evaluation data analyze study consider whether adjustment intervention implementation may indicate , finding also use inform future implementation effort .</detailed_description>
