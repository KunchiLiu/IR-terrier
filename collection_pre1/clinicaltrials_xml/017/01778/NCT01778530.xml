	<brief_summary>Background : - Glioblastoma aggressive type brain cancer often resist treatment . TRC105 experimental drug block growth new blood vessel . It study possible use treat different kind cancer . Researchers want see TRC105 use treat glioblastoma respond standard treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness TRC105 adult glioblastoma respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age glioblastoma respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study test use study tumor start treatment . - Participants 28-day ( 4-week ) cycle treatment . - Participants TRC105 intravenously week . The first infusion take 4 hour . The length time need infusion may slowly reduce well tolerate . - At end first cycle ( first 4 week ) , image study repeat continue TRC105 . - Participants take TRC105 long tumor grow side effect severe . They image study end every cycle evaluate tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRC105 Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - TRC105 anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) bind CD105 ( Endoglin ) , transmembrane glycoprotein essential angiogenesis , express abundantly activate vascular endothelial cell ( ECs ) . CD105 member transform growth factor-Beta ( TGF-Beta ) receptor superfamily , modulate TGF-Beta signal lead EC proliferation migration . - Immunohistochemistry study reveal CD105 preferentially express blood vessel tumor tissue compare normal mucosa . For patient glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , increased expression CD105 may correspond bad survival time . Furthermore , expression CD105 essential neovascularization , upregulated setting ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) VEGF inhibition . - TRC105 bind CD105 lead inhibition EC proliferation , neovascularization , induces cell death via apoptosis . TRC105 may also mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Objectives : Primary - To determine radiographic response rate patient recurrent GBM treat TRC105 . - To establish data regard anti-tumor activity TRC105 patient GBM , determine progression free survival . Secondary - To obtain information regard safety TRC105 patient recurrent GBM . - To evaluate health-related quality life ( HRQL ) patient treatment TRC105 . - To examine effect TRC105 vascular permeability measure percent change baseline forward contrast transfer rate ( Ktrans ) dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) . - To examine effect TRC105 vascular perfusion measure percent change baseline cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) , cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , mean transit time ( MTT ) dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging ( DSC-MRI ) . - To examine effect TRC105 water diffusion measure percent change baseline apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) fractional anisotropy ( FA ) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . - To examine effect TRC105 tumor metabolism measure percent change baseline fludeoxyglucose F18 injection ( FDG ) uptake positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . - To obtain preliminary data regard change serial FDG-PET scan physiological MRI correlate radiographic response rate progression free survival patient treat TRC105 . Eligibility : -This phase II trial patient recurrent GBM VEGF therapy naive . Design : -Prior treatment start , patient undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) include MRI perfusion diffusion scan , well FDG-PET scan . Patients receive TRC105 single agent ( weekly dose 10 mg/kg IV ) . A cycle consist 4 week therapy . At end first cycle , magnetic resonance ( MR ) image FDG-PET scan repeat continue treatment . Patients clinically neurologically stable , radiographic stable respond disease end cycle continue treatment TRC105 . MRI perfusion diffusion repeat completion cycle therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients must histologically confirm glioblastoma gliosarcoma . Patients must evidence tumor progression magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . This scan perform within 14 day prior registration fix dose steroid least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date image registration new baseline MR/CT require . The type scan , ie , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . Patients must progress radiation therapy must interval great Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy : 4 week investigational agent , 4 week prior cytotoxic therapy , two week vincristine , 6 week nitrosoureas , 3 week procarbazine administration , 1 week noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct Study Chair . All toxicity prior therapy resolve National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) less equal grade 1 ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Patients must &gt; 18 year old . Because dose adverse event data currently available use TRC105 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 % Life expectancy great 12 week .
