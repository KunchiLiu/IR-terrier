	<brief_summary>Background : - Lipodystrophy condition people enough fat body . People lipodystrophy problem diabetes enlarge liver . Researchers look leptin , hormone produce fat cell , help people problem . Leptin help control appetite body store food . Taking leptin help people lipodystrophy eat less food , may help treat diabetes problem . To good understand leptin work , researcher want inpatient study leptin treatment people lipodystrophy . Objectives : - To study leptin treatment affect lipodystrophy . Eligibility : - Individuals 14 70 year age lipodystrophy . Design : - All participant 19-day stay National Institutes Health Clinical Center . One group participants test 5 day start take leptin . They take leptin 2 week , test . The group participants test 5 day take leptin . They take stop take leptin 2 week , test , start take leptin . - Participants regular blood urine test visit . Some blood test look insulin level . Some look body metabolize sugar fat . Other test check hormone level , especially reproductive hormone . - During visit , participant spend 3 separate day metabolic chamber , special room measure many calorie body us . Urine sample collect stay . - Participants also several body image study , include magnetic resonance image body composition scan . - Physical activity test exercise bicycle electronic activity monitor . - Participants ask question hunger comfort level throughout stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Leptin adipocyte-derived hormone think signal adipose tissue rest body convey information long-term nutritional status . Patients lipodystrophy leptin deficiency secondary lack adipose tissue , thus represent natural model study effect leptin deficiency replacement human . Leptin replacement lipodystrophy ameliorate metabolic endocrine abnormality , include reduce food intake , improve insulin resistance diabetes , reduce ectopic lipid , normalize reproduction . The reduction energy intake induce leptin replacement likely responsible part improvement observe glucose lipid metabolism . The clinical effect leptin independent change energy intake , mechanism underlying effect , poorly explore human . Aim The primary aim study determine energy intake-independent effect leptin energy metabolism lipodystrophic subject . The major aspect energy metabolism study : 1 . Lipid metabolism , include fast lipid , lipolysis fatty acid turnover , ectopic lipid storage . 2 . Glucose metabolism , include fast glucose , endogenous glucose production , insulin sensitivity 3 . Energy expenditure , include total rest energy expenditure , skeletal muscle work efficiency , spontaneous physical activity In addition , effect leptin endocrine autonomic function examine , include effect thyroid , gonadal , adrenal ax , well blood pressure , body temperature , heart rate variability . Methods This non-randomized , parallel group study . Two group patient age 14 70 year lipodystrophy study : leptin naive leptin treat . Minors include leptin naive arm . All subject stabilize weight maintenance diet 5 day ( Period 1 ) . After , leptin withdrawn leptin treated subject , leptin initiate leptin naive subject period 14 day ( Period 2 ) . The isocaloric diet continue throughout Periods , permit study leptin effect independent energy intake . All subject undergo metabolic test admission , end Period 1 , throughout Period 2 , generate detail short-term time course effect leptin initiation withdrawal . At end Period 2 , leptin continue leptin naive subject , restart leptin treated subject . Repeat metabolic test perform 6-12 month leptin initiation leptin-naive cohort generate information leptin long-term effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 1470 year ( child age 18 enrol leptinnaive arm study Clinicallysignificant lipodystrophy define protocol 02DK0022 ( Long Term Efficacy Leptin Replacement Treatment Lipodystrophy ) . Relevant inclusion criterion enrollment protocol 02DK0022 ( summarize ) : Lipodystrophy identify study physician physical examination absence fat outside range normal Circulating leptin level &lt; 12.0 ng/mL female &lt; 8.0 ng/mL male Presence least one follow metabolic abnormality : 1 . Diabetes define 2007 American Diabetes Association criteria 2 . Fasting insulin &gt; 30 microU/mL 3 . Fasting hypertriglyceridemia &gt; 200 mg/dL Coenrolled protocol 02DK0022 either : Leptin na ( SqrRoot ) , plan initiate leptin treatment current study . For purpose study , leptin naive define receive exogenous leptin 4 month prior study participation . Thus , subject previously receive leptin therapy , discontinue , wish restart eligible . Or Leptin treat , mean subject take stable dose exogenous leptin minimum 4 month ( adults age 18 , ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : In leptin treated subject , follow exclusion criterion apply : Poorly control diabetes study entry ( hemoglobin A1c great equal 9 % ) Poorly control hypertriglyceridemia study entry ( serum triglyceride &gt; 800 mg/dL ) Extreme hypertriglyceridemia prior leptin ( triglyceride great 2000 mg/dL initiation leptin treatment ) History chronic recurrent acute pancreatitis ( &gt; 1 episode ) , single episode pancreatitis receive leptin treatment Lipase great upper limit normal ( 491 units/L ) study entry In subject ( leptin treat leptin naive ) , follow exclusion criterion apply : Known HIV infection HIVassociated lipodystrophy History diabetic ketoacidosis Active inflammatory disease ( e.g . dermatomyositis ) Change diabetes lipidlowering medication within past 6 week Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/minute Current recent ( past 2 week ) use systemic glucocorticoid Inadequately control hypothyroidism ( TSH &lt; 0.4 &gt; 4 mcIU/L ) change thyroid medication past 8 week . Pregnancy breastfeed Psychiatric disorder impede competence compliance Any medical condition medication increase risk subject ( e.g . ischemic heart disease , decompensated liver disease ) interfere interpretation study data ( e.g . Cushing syndrome ) .</criteria>
