	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) one common chronic childhood disease require lifelong insulin therapy . Children adolescents T1D need regular insulin injection continuous insulin delivery use insulin pump order keep blood glucose level normal . We know keep blood sugar normal range help prevent longterm diabetes-related complication involve eye , kidney heart . However , achieve treatment goal difficult tight try control blood glucose level , great risk develop symptom sign low glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . This particular problem night one solution develop system whereby amount insulin inject control computer closely match blood sugar level continuous basis . This achieve know `` closed-loop system '' small glucose sensor place skin communicates computer contain algorithm drive insulin pump . We test system Cambridge last five year child find system effective maintain tight glucose control prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia . More recently system test real life condition home set three week pilot single-centre study . The next step extend evaluation closed-loop prolong period three month . In present study planning study 24 young people age 6-18 year insulin pump therapy . During three month glucose control computer three month subject make adjustment insulin therapy use real-time continuous glucose monitoring . We aim determine effect computer algorithm keep glucose level 3.9 8 mmol/L ( normal level ) . Safety evaluation comprises assessment frequency severe hypoglycaemic episode . Participants ' response use system term lifestyle change , daily diabetes management fear hypoglycaemia assess . We also test long term glucose control measure glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose study The purpose research evaluate efficacy , safety utility overnight automate closed-loop system home set consecutive night 3-month period , compare use real-time continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) alone . Design The study design form open-label , cross-over study involve two 3-month-long home study overnight glucose level control either closed-loop ( CL ) system combine real-time continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) real-time continuous glucose monitoring alone , random order . The study take place within home setting , initially , overnight supervision closed-loop system undertaken research nurse either home in-patient facility . Three UK centre involve study : Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge , University College London Hospital ( UCLH ) , London , Leeds Teaching Hospitals , Leeds Population A total 30 child adolescent T1D 6 18 year age insulin pump therapy recruit Paediatric Diabetes Outpatient Clinics three investigation centre allow 24 evaluable subject . Each investigation centre recruit least three subject achieve balance representation study population . Potential participant identify treat clinician invite contact research team . They send study information leaflet invitation join study research team . They opportunity read discuss information . If agree participate study , inform consent and/or assent take member research team good work knowledge aim practicality study . The person take consent use language easy understand free medical jargon . Experimental Procedures The study consist 10 visit , include two study period ( closed-loop vs. conventional pump therapy + continuous glucose monitoring ) . The study period last 3 month . The order two intervention random . Once subject agree participate study , invite recruitment visit , participant ' body weight height , demographic , medical diabetes history , previous day insulin therapy record . Urine pregnancy test also perform female children-bearing age . Once consent obtain inclusion exclusion criterion meet subject include study allocate sequential subject number . Blood sample take baseline measurement random C-peptide , glucose HbA1c . Eligible subject also undergo baseline evaluation blood sample renal , liver , thyroid function , full blood count anti-transglutaminase antibody IgA level take ( do previous 3 month ) . Validated questionnaire distribute assess user friendliness device use study participant fear hypoglycaemia entering study . Study participant also invite participate semi-structured qualitative interview conduct trained staff , occur face-to-face via telephone , within 2-4 week ( train period ) , determine expectation diabetes treatment use study . All eligible subject sign informed consent invite training session use device employ study . - Two four week prior first study night subject switch regular insulin pump study subcutaneous insulin infusion pump period study . Local diabetes clinic guideline switch insulin pump follow . Subjects give train functionality pump research team standard operational procedure , well pump user manual , provide . The research paediatric diabetes team available telephone assist concern subject may regard pump . - A training session Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) take place two four week study start . Subjects train use study CGM system . Subjects train home/clinic research nurse insert subcutaneous glucose sensor provide study CGM system wear home least three consecutive 5-day-sensor session ( least 12 day use ) subject become confident device , namely performance sensor insertion calibration . During two four week training period CGM display may mask subject able see glucose value . For subject use CGM part normal diabetes care , CGM display mask training period . At end training period sensor data download research team use optimise insulin therapy prior start study . This do collaboration paediatrics diabetes team . The CGM reading record training period use assess baseline glucose control . At end training session , competency assessment tool use evaluate subject ' competency use device . Subjects ' compliance diabetes management also evaluate term time wear continuous glucose monitoring device . A minimum 12 day continuous glucose monitor reading record time use device . Competency compliance evaluation determine participant ' eligibility randomisation . Eligible subject , complete training session use study subcutaneous insulin pump study CGM device gain confidence use device assess research team , randomise one 2 intervention arm : 1 . Real-time CGM + overnight CL 2 . Real-time CGM alone Three four week completion intervention arm , subject cross alternative intervention : allocate CGM+CL intervention switch CGM alone intervention , whereas complete CGM alone intervention allocate CGM+CL intervention . During three-to-four-weeks wash period , real-time CGM may use . Additional training use real-time CGM provide begin first intervention arm . This involve train interpret data display real-time CGM device screen perform insulin therapy adjustment accord glucose report . Written guideline use real-time retrospective information provide subject . At begin closed-loop intervention , subject provide specific training use closed-loop system . Closed-loop training carry two consecutive stage : 1 . Supervised Closed Loop : closed-loop system start even bedtime remain operation follow morning . Each subject supervise start closed-loop system research nurse/doctor one night home in-patient facility , option second supervise night start closed-loop intervention , subject confident use equipment . For subject supervise use closed-loop system in-patient facility , research nurse/clinician may provide assistance supervision set closed-loop system first night home . 2 . Unsupervised Closed Loop : Subjects use closed-loop system overnight home total duration 12 week . The subcutaneous CGM sensor replace every 5 day subject . Support telephone advice provide research team duration study deal concern may arise use closed-loop system component . Cross-over procedure : Having complete first intervention arm , subject cross intervention arm wash-out period three four week . Blood sample determination HbA1c take investigate change metabolic control . Validated questionnaire distribute evaluate impact satisfaction well user friendliness device employ complete arm study . A questionnaire evaluate fear hypoglycaemia also distribute parent child . Study participant invite participate semi-structured qualitative interview conduct trained staff within 0-4 week complete Closed Loop intervention arm , include view diabetes treatment experience . The second intervention treatment arm start three four week end first arm . In two intervention arm , subject resume usual insulin regimen , use either study insulin pump usual patient 's insulin pump . Real-time CGM may use part standard diabetes management . End study : Having complete second intervention arm study , subject revert conventional insulin pump therapy switch insulin pump use enter study . Blood sample determination HbA1c take investigate change metabolic control . Validated questionnaire distribute evaluate impact satisfaction well user friendliness device employ complete arm study .</detailed_description>
