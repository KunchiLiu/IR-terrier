	<brief_summary>According recent information release American Heart Association , heart failure affect 5.8 million Americans 23 million people worldwide . In particular , diastolic heart failure ( DHF ) emerge approximately half suffer heart disease become major public health problem many reason , include complexity disease , lack effective drugs/therapies , requirement invasive test diagnose monitor DHF , absence suitable scientific model study disease . Scientists physician alike still fully understand happens muscle heart ( myocardium ) patient present diastolic dysfunction DHF . Therefore , medical field need accurate model evaluate diastolic dysfunction lead heart failure happen cellular level disease emerge progress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mathematical Modeling Determine Basic Muscle Properties Failing Heart</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our group develop mathematical model heart gather data procedure call echocardiograph ( echo ) analyze muscle heart function . This model incorporate heart muscle function cellular level along overall functionality heart . We hypothesize model measure specific property heart muscle affect ability contract relax . This study determine whether property different patient DHF compare healthy control . We also propose abnormality heart muscle correlate patient 's degree heart failure prognosis doctor evaluate use standard clinical test . This study conduct University Nebraska Medical Center ( UNMC ) . 40 subject enrol , 20 healthy control history heart disease 20 subject diagnose diastolic heart failure . Healthy control require undergo 1 echocardiograph procedure UNMC . Subjects diagnose DHF require undergo 6 echocardiograph procedure course 2 year .</detailed_description>
