	<brief_summary>Background : - Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) disease blur sharp vision need activity read , sew , drive . It affect macula , center retina back eye , allow person see fine detail . Researchers want collect medical history , eye exam data , genetic information may associate AMD . They want compare information information collect people without AMD . Objectives : - To collect medical information gene sample researcher study AMD . Eligibility : - Individuals 60 90 year age AMD least one eye . - Individuals 60 90 year age AMD either eye . Design : - This study involve one study visit . This study visit last 6 8 hour . - Participants follow test exams part study visit : - Full physical exam medical history - Full eye examination - Laser scan eye - Retina function test - Vision sensitivity test - Optional blood sample ( genetic study ) - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMD Phenotype Genotype Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Late age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness among elderly United States . At present current classification system take consideration advance image technology genotyping phenotyping . Clinical center US around world conduct pilot cohort study bring together resource commitment test feasibility develop new classification scheme AMD use image visual function biomarkers , potential correlating genetic information obtain future . These data could eventually help develop understanding mechanism involve development progression AMD . A database men woman without AMD establish maintain . The project recruit participant various stage AMD control . The pilot study identify feasibility obtain image visual function data help identify modality include full scale longitudinal study , well frequently sit obtain . All data , image potential biospecimens full scale longitudinal study available researcher worldwide help development biomarker identification classification development . The initiative provide unparalleled state-of-the-art standardized phenotype/genotype include AMD status information imaging , visual function , biospecimen biomarkers . This study first phase initiative test feasibility logistics define standard database include enhance phenotype genotype data . Study Population : This cohort study recruit minimum 200 total participant various stage AMD , include control obtain appropriate image measure visual function need investigation validation AMD phenotype . Design : This cohort study multi-national , multi-center , observational study focus AMD . The study pilot test ability create archive data , biological sample ( collect study site ) , measure visual function ophthalmic image collect time well clinically characterize population participant diagnosis AMD . The database also include control group consist participant without diagnosis AMD . Outcome Measures : The design cohort study data collect allow user assess phenotype AMD , develop evaluate potential marker risk factor , develop evaluate AMD classification scheme ( ) , assess progression disease investigate factor shape . It practical anticipate potential us data , type analysis perform address user-defined question .</detailed_description>
