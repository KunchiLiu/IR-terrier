	<brief_summary>Background : - Many psychiatric , behavioral , developmental disorder genetic . This mean tend run family . Some begin childhood , others appear adulthood . Researchers want look people age disorder start childhood . They also look relative people disorder . This information allow doctor learn childhood behavioral problem inherit . It may also help doctor treat disorder . Objectives : - To study onset treatment childhood behavioral , psychiatric , developmental disorder . Eligibility : - Individuals age psychiatric , autism spectrum , developmental disorder , behavioral problem . - Family member individual disorder . This group may include parent , grandparent , sibling , aunts/uncles , cousin , child . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They psychiatric history test think , judgment , behavior . Blood urine sample collect . Brain imaging scan perform look brain function . They may spinal tap collect cerebrospinal fluid . - Relatives medical history physical exam . They also psychiatric history test think , judgment , behavior . Blood urine sample collect . Brain imaging scan perform look brain function . - A relative exam may reveal behavioral disorder . If , may re-enroll study person disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This diagnostic treatment protocol design provide opportunity identify new clinical syndrome , provide case instruction training , permit longitudinal assessment variety childhood behavioral , psychiatric developmental disorder . Disorders particular interest : autism , disorder social cognition neurodevelopmental disorder ; childhood psychiatric disorder particularly acute symptom onset ; unique clinical presentation pediatric behavioral syndrome , associate genetic disorder unique family history . Objectives : The primary objective protocol evaluate variety behavioral , neuropsychiatric neurodevelopmental condition . Assessing treat participant allow PDN clinician maintain clinical expertise provide opportunity train . Further , protocol allow PDN investigator gain additional knowledge course various childhood behavioral syndrome response standard therapy . The information obtain expect generate question answer hypothesis test future protocol . In case , blood , cerebrospinal fluid biologic sample ( include urine , saliva cheek swab ) obtain clinical study store future laboratory study . Study Population : The number participant enrol set 3,500 participant permit inclusion 1,000 probands ( child , adolescent adult ) relative ( n = 2,500 include key 2nd 3rd degree relative , well 1st degree relative ) . Design : This natural history , treatment training protocol . The cross-sectional portion study include in-depth medical laboratory assessment evaluate relationship biological abnormality neuropsychiatric symptomatology . Family member study elucidate nature genetic abnormality observe probands . Clinically useful information ( perform CLIA certify lab ) share participant . Standard therapeutic intervention may utilize evaluate effect well-characterized participant unique clinical presentation . Participants also may ask return NIH periodic follow-up assessment , order facilitate longitudinal assessment natural treat course illness mean well understand progression pathophysiology . Outcome Measures : No formal outcome measure ; however clinical assessment enrol participant may use evaluate correlate clinical symptomatology response standard therapeutic intervention . In addition , DNA sample may obtain participant relative , order identify verify causative genetic abnormality order establish pathogenic mechanism genotype-phenotype correlation .</detailed_description>
