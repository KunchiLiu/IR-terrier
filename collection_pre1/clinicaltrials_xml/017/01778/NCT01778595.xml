	<brief_summary>Background : - Early detection colon cancer improve chance successful treatment people . This approach especially important blood detect stool . However , much good stool sample test need find cancer early . To improve test , researcher want collect sample people already screen colon cancer . This study collect information sample old adult Shanghai , China . These adult participate screen test colon cancer . Objectives : - To collect sample medical information colon cancer screen old adult Shanghai , China . Eligibility : - Adults 50 74 year age screen colon cancer . - Participants recruit two community health center Shanghai , China . Design : - Participants provide information medical history factor related colon cancer . They respond question use medication , diet choice ( eat red meat ) , bowel habit , factor . - Participants collect sample study . These sample collect within 3 day screen visit . Particpants provide urine sample four stool sample . They also use cotton swab collect sample inside anus . The sample return study doctor research test may indicate colon cancer . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To examine risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) relate microbes inhabit distal human intestine ( microbiota ) , propose large study compare characteristic fecal microbiota CRC patient control Shanghai population . In advance , propose small pilot study follow two objective : 1 ) determine participation rate among Shanghai adult , age 50-74 positive fecal immunochemical test ( FIT+ ) ; 2 ) determine suitability fecal specimen provide participant microbiome analysis . Each two Shanghai community health center , CRC screen ongoing , recruit 25 FIT+ participant ( half male ; half age 50-64 , half age 65-74 ) . Each 50 participant provide informed consent , brief questionnaire data , blood plasma buffy coat , urine specimen , four sample one stool , frozen . Complete blood count plasma glucose , cholesterol , creatinine level determine real time return participant . Each participant plasma , buffy coat , urine , one pair fecal sample store frozen future genetic assay . DNA extract second pair fecal sample participant ( n=100 vial ) , amplify 16S rRNA gene , sequence determine fecal microbiome profile . Participation deem unsatisfactory participation &lt; 30 % overall ( 95 % confidence interval 17 % - 43 % N=50 participant ) , &lt; 20 male , female , young , old participant . Specimen quality deem unsatisfactory intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) &lt; 0.70 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.53 0.82 N=50 pair vial ) Shannon index estimate microbiome alpha diversity . As amend , two community health center recruit 600 additional adult present CRC screening , irrespective FITstatus , ask provide saliva well specimens .</detailed_description>
