	<brief_summary>Ultrasound-guided ethanol ablation effective treatment modality patient cystic thyroid nodule ( cystic portion &gt; 90 % ) ; however less effective predominantly cystic thyroid nodule ( 90 % &gt; cystic portion &gt; 50 % ) . The volume reduction EA report 64 % - 69.8 % predominantly cystic thyroid nodule . EA insufficient 26 % ( 27/103 ) patient predominantly cystic thyroid nodule . Radiofrequency ablation patient incompletely resolve clinical problem EA mean volume reduction ratio 92 % 6-month follow-up . It well know RF ablation effective predominantly cystic solid thyroid nodule . Although RF ablation effectively treat patient unsatisfactory EA , best knowledge , study date compare two ablation technique . Therefore investigator perform prospective randomize study compare single-session RF ablation EA treat predominantly cystic thyroid nodule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RFA ( Radiofrequency Ablation ) Versus EA ( Ethanol Ablation ) Predominantly Cystic Thyroid Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ablation Procedures Both RF ablation EA perform patient supine position mild neck extension . Before treatment , investigator measure three orthogonal diameter nodule , i.e , large diameter two , mutually perpendicular diameter , volume nodule calculate use equation V = Ï€ abc/6 , V volume , large diameter , b c two diameter . Investigators use 2 % lidocaine skin puncture site . The skin puncture , target nodule approach use trans-isthmic approach method RF ablation electrode EA needle insert short axis nodule isthmus target nodule . This technical approach several advantage . It prevent change position needle electrode patient swallow talk ablation also prevent fluid leakage , i.e . inject ethanol ablate , hot fluid cystic portion thyroid nodule , area outside thyroid gland . This approach also allow clear , continuous US monitoring relationship nodule , needle electrode tip , expect location recurrent laryngeal nerve , thus minimize risk injury nerve and/or esophagus . Radiofrequency Ablation All patient require fast least six hour procedure . Before start RF ablation , investigator aspirate internal fluid much possible . Moving shot technique thyroid RF ablation propose . In treatment liver , electrode fix ablation . Because thyroid relatively small organ compare liver , prolonged fixation electrode dangerous . Investigators therefore divide thyroid nodule multiple conceptual ablation unit , perform RF ablation unit unit move electrode tip . These conceptual ablation unit small periphery nodule portion nodule adjacent critical structure neck ; however unit large central safe portion . Initially , electrode tip position deep , remote imaginary unit nodule enable easy monitoring electrode tip without disturbance cause microbubbles . The electrode move within thyroid mass tilt upward downward . When ablation peripheral unit finish , electrode move backward superficial direction . Ablation begin 40 W RF power . If transient hyperechoic zone form electrode tip within 5-10 second , RF power increase 10-W increment ( 100 ) W. If patient tolerate pain ablation , RF power reduce turned . Ablation terminate imaginary unit change transient hyperechoic zone . Investigators check possible complication immediately procedure order ass safety . Procedure-related pain grade four category , i.e . grade 0 , RF power turn patient experienced pain ; grade 1 , RF power turn 1-2 time patient 's pain ; grade 2 , RF power turn three time patient 's pain ; grade 3 , RF procedure incompletely terminate due patient 's severe pain . After RF ablation , patient observe 1-2 hour still hospital . Ethanol Ablation A 16- 18-gauge needle insert nodule isthmus . After needle tip place cystic portion , internal fluid aspirate maximal extent possible , follow slow injection 99 % ethanol cystic space . If cyst content viscous , Investigators aspirate viscous fluid use large-bore needle ( 16-gauge ) attach 30-mL syringe , follow irrigation normal saline remove viscous material attach cystic wall solid component , ethanol inject . The volume ethanol inject usually correspond 50 % aspirated volume . After 2 minute ethanol retention needle place , inject ethanol completely remove needle withdrawn . Investigators inject ethanol solid component . In order ass safety , Investigators check complication immediately procedure . Procedure-related pain grade four category , i.e . grade 0 , pain mild pain similar pain experience lidocaine injection ; grade 1 , pain great lidocaine injection , require medication ; grade 2 , pain require medication ; grade 3 , procedure incompletely terminate due severe pain ( 1 ) . Following procedure , patient observe 30 minute still hospital .</detailed_description>
