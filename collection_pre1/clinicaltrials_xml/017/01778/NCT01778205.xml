	<brief_summary>The recent fall birth death rate lead demographic change low fertility high life expectancy . The WHO report median age European population high world predict proportion over-60s increase 14 % 2010 25 % 2050 . There wide variability quality health well-being age population . Longevity good quality life consequence combination individual 's gene , nutrition , environment , lifestyle medical intervention . There increase evidence research healthy age needs start early life data capture traits exposure experience individual throughout life . Epigenetic imprinting occur utero early postnatal development . Maternal environmental exposure , include nutritional status , may permanent effect develop foetus influence epigenetic profile lead life-long genome adaptation . Numerous report show restrict intra-uterine growth due poor maternal nutrition pregnancy increase risk offspring develop mental disorder , metabolic syndrome , cardiovascular disease stroke later life . To understand basic mechanism interaction age phenotype develops , system involve key process early development must consider well crucial health old person . The Reus Tarragona Birth Cohort longitudinal study . In first phase , blood collect pregnant woman &lt; 12 , 15 , 24-27 34 gestational week ( GW ) labor cord . Detailed lifestyle , habit supplement use data collect 20 32 gestational week nutritional habit &lt; 12GW birth . Placental vascular function assess 20 32 GW analysis Doppler waveforms uterine artery . Data pregnancy evolution outcome also record . The first phase investigate association gene-environment ( nutrient lifestyle habit ) interaction fetal growth pregnancy outcome . The second phase study follow child 7.5 year age . Growth , exercise nutritional habit well environment cognitive development assess . The aim investigate association gene-environment interaction associate healthy development early pregnancy 7.5 year age .</brief_summary>
