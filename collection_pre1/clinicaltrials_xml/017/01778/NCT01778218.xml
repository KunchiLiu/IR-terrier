	<detailed_description>The study assess safety tolerability technetium-99m-labeled ethylenedicysteine-deoxyglucose ( 99mTc-EC-DG ) . An outcome develop image protocol multicenter trial measure specific image parameter require determination sensitivity specificity 99mTc-EC-DG cardiovascular single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) study compare exercise/regadenoson 99mTc- Sestamibi ( MIBI ) study detection presence , available , severity coronary artery disease ( CAD ) document coronary angiography available . This study single-center , prospective , open-label study 6 patient positive finding MIBI ( 99mTc-sestamibi ) exercise/regadenoson study within 30 day evaluation CAD . Patients meet study eligibility criterion undergo 99mTc-EC-DG rest study 99mTc-EC-DG exercise/regadenoson study . When possible , patient enrol clinical plan coronary angiography study confirm presence severity CAD . This study enroll 6 patient reversible perfusion defect indicative CAD MIBI exercise/regadenoson study . These patient undergo 99mTc-EC-DG rest study exercise/regadenoson study .</detailed_description>
