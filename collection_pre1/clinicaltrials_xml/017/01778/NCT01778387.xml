	<detailed_description>Population : 130 patient , diagnose clinic radiologic ( abdominal wall CT scan ) ventral hernia , recruit , express willingness , either laparoscopic laparotomy repair conduct Infanta Elena Hospital , Huelva ( Spain ) , January 2005 October 2008 . Recruitment criterion : patient 18 year old , diagnosed primary incisional ventral hernia , include recurrent one , feature prior-to-operation estimate size 20 225 cm2 . Exclusion criterion include type 4 5 ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologist ) , suffer disease limit lifespan le 2 year , cirrhotic ascites , emergency surgery complication intestinal obstruction , strangulate hernia , peritonitis , local systemic infection , failure patient ensure least 2 year follow-up abandonment protocol . Every patient fully inform sign willingness . Defect size estimate classify follow Chevrel Classification . Patients assign randomly generate number ( see validate published table ) , mean laparoscopic open repair , informed morning operation . All operation conduct experienced surgeon . Protocol approve Local Ethics Committee . General techniques All patient give heparin prophylactic dose prevent thromboembolic event even prior operation-day , well 1500 mg cefuroxime intravenous ( IV ) anesthetic induction ( case allergy , 600 mg clindamycin IV + 80 mg gentamicin IV ) . Also , even intervention-day patient fill survey ( SF-36 questionnaire ) . Skin prepare alcoholic solution clorhexidine . Surgical pain treat magnesium metamizole ( 2gr IV 6 hour ) . Upon patient request , 100 mg tramadol IV add ( maximum amount 400 mg ) . Every patient encourage hang around soon possible diet 8 hour surgery , supply oral treatment onwards . On discharge , patient recommend wear abdominal binder month . Laparoscopic repair : Pneumoperitoneum perform 12 mmHg placement first 12 mm trocar level umbilicus anterior axillary line . Subsequently place two 5 mm auxiliary trocars . In case explore entire abdominal wall defect detect preoperatively . Herniary content sac reduce release adhesion diathermy harmonic scalpel . Defects repair polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) patch ( Dual Mesh ; W.L Gore Associates , FlagstaV , AZ USA ) double crown fixation technique Carbajo et al , ensure exceed 3 cm edge defect , use 5mm tacker ( Protack , Autosuture ; Tyco Healthcare , USA ) , reduce intrabdominal pressure 8 mmHg . Not abdominal drainage use . Skin close metal staple . All operation perform experienced surgeon , 40 laparoscopic ventral hernia repair . Open repair : Incision make hernia defect , reduce herniary content open sac necessary . We make 4 cm soft tissue flap around edge defect depend available healthy fascial tissue . In case use Chevrel technique fascial closure use anterior rectus sheath continuous absorbable suture placement polypropylene mesh ( Parietene , standart polypropylene mesh , Covidien , Norwalk , CT ) onlay position fix polypropylene suture . We use one two suction drain subcutaneous flap suture absorbable suture , metallic skin staple . Follow-up A give follow-up always conduct researcher hospital discharge , 30 day , 60 day , year year thereafter . All postoperative report analyze aim find protocol deviation intraoperative complication . At hospital follow-up , discharge , complication actively look ( seroma , hematoma , wound infection , prolong ileus , urinary retention medical complication stroke , respiratory failure , arrhythmia , deep vein thrombosis , adverse drug reaction pneumonia ) , hospital stay achieve onset walk . Patient-centered outcome analyze pain measure visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , addition daily physical activity , analysis quality life relate health survey 2 5 day ( CVP-CG questionnaire ) difference preoperative value , 3 month 12 month physical mental construct survey ( SF-36 questionnaire ) . At follow-up discharge several fact take exhibit satisfactory evolution , among absence hernia recurrence ( define clinic examination radiologic non-defect abdominal wall ) , absence symptom relate disability ( chronic pain , intermittent ileus , trocar site hernia , fistula , abscess prosthesis extrusion ) also absence readmission reoperation due hernia repair . Cost analysis Expenses spend ventral hernia repair calculate viewpoint funder ( health cost ) , take account direct expense discard indirect intangible one , nearly patient economically assisted convalescence period . Euro currency use prospective approach cost analysis employ , follow cost-opportunity method . As in-hospital expense follow variable use material , prosthesis , suture , trocars , drainages surgical instrument ; preoperative , anesthetic postoperative medication ( include recommend discharge ) ; operation room personnel cost hospital ward ; cost diagnostic test perform consumption hospitality . Installation cost , equipment inventoried cost warehouse inventory management consumables neglect . As extra-hospital cost follow item include : personnel material use medical visit cure , drug prescribe , travel cost medical transport , totality generate consequence convalescence period ( 60 day ) . Finally , expense produce new hospital stay reoperation complicate issue within two year hernia repair estimate , accord direct hospital cost begin study add hospital expense . As expenditure variable use average patient cost . Statistical analysis A sample size 130 patient consider order detect difference morbidity increase hospital stay 20 % , assume type I error 5 % , powder 80 % , loss 10 % 2 % crosslinking . To confirm normality Kolmogorov-Smirnov test employed . Discrete variable present percentage confidence interval 95 % compare either Pearson test Fisher exact test . Quantitative variable depict mean value standard deviation confidence interval 95 % use Student 's test . In case analysis intention treat include laparoscopic group patient require conversion laparotomy . Also , incremental cost-effectiveness analysis confidence interval 95 % conduct , follow Fieller theorem , sensibility analysis inversion cross-point take ( threshold analysis ) . As efficiency measure clinic profit analysis carry mean composite analysis integrates absence recurrence , readmission , reoperation disability . As indirect measure utility use value obtain questionnaire ( HRQOL -Health Related Quality Of Life ) , assume standard mean response case SF-36 mean response standardize standard deviation difference case CVP-CG instrument two type repair well effect size preoperative value postoperative one case SF-36 . choice measurement HRQOL measure utility make requirement absence clinically relevant difference mortality , recurrence morbidity , clinically relevant difference HRQOL preference patient thus choice treatment alternative . A minimum significance level 0.05 assume . Every analysis conduct blind statistician statistical package ( SPSS statistical program , version 11.5 , SPSS Inc , Chicago ) .</detailed_description>
