	<brief_summary>Background : - Uveal coloboma condition eye form normally . It occur early fetus development pregnancy . It lead different kind eye problem , include blindness . Several gene link coloboma , cause case hard find . Researchers want study gene people coloboma gene close , unaffected relative ( parent sibling ) . Objectives : - To study gene associate uveal coloboma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 1 year age either uveal coloboma unaffected relative ( parent sibling ) . Design : - Participants physical exam medical history . They also full eye exam . - Participants uveal coloboma may exams , image study hear assessment . - All participant also provide blood cheek swab saliva sample genetic testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study 1 ) define ocular systemic association cohort well-phenotyped participant uveal coloboma , 2 ) define risk factor microforms coloboma relative affect individual 3 ) establish repository DNA and/or lymphoblastoid cell line participant uveal coloboma relative use laboratory investigation . Study Population : Two hundred forty ( 240 ) individual least one year age document uveal coloboma relative enrol . Design : This natural history/genetic repository study . Two hundred forty ( 240 ) participant enrol four year . Participants undergo complete age-appropriate baseline eye examination physical examination provide blood buccal cell sample . Outcome Measures : The test , data , sample collect analyzed good understand genetics uveal coloboma . In particular , ocular systemic association define cohort well-phenotyped participant uveal coloboma , risk factor microforms coloboma relative affect individual .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The participant must one year age older . The participant must able cooperate ageappropriate eye examination . The participant must able provide blood saliva sample . The participant must able understand sign protocol inform consent form OR legal parent/guardian ability . The participant must either : affected uveal coloboma OR asymptomatic relative affect individual . Participants consider affected uveal coloboma clear ocular phenotype relate uveal coloboma deem affected clinical evaluation ( e.g. , presence unique , systemic manifestation cosegregating coloboma , rare unique kidney find ) .</criteria>
