	<brief_summary>One recent advance cataract surgery microincisional phacoemulsification ( MICS ) . Through small incision 2.0 mm less lens material emulsify either bimanually thin single coaxial hand-piece . The possible advantage low induced corneal astigmatism1 , 2 , possibly low incidence infection due high resistance wound deformation3 low risk complication iris prolapse surgery patient risk intraoperative floppy iris syndrome ( IFIS ) . Additional factor take account construction position incision influence extraocular force wound morphology.4 Another effect may influence wound architecture stromal hydration end surgery.5 Wound architecture recently assessed6-9 use optical coherence tomography . Elkady et al.10 observe wound architecture MICS case focus corneal thickness incision angle . However , none study observe effect wound architecture post-operative astigmatism . Furthermore , observation past performed post-operative period information concern wound architecture intra-operatively miss . A recently launch CE-marked intra-operative OCT allow observe wound architecture intra-operatively . One aim study assess influence intra-operative wound architecture use similar grading system use Calladine Packard ( 2007 ) 7 resistance deformation wound surgically induced astigmatism MICS small incision cataract surgery ( SICS ) . In second part exploratory study effect hinge incision pre-cut assess along line</brief_summary>
