	<brief_summary>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operation combine restrictive malabsorptive principle . It commonly perform bariatric procedure worldwide ( ~ 50 % ) . Vertical ( sleeve ) gastrectomy hand , purely restrictive procedure gain popularity accept valid procedure accounting approximately five percent bariatric procedure perform worldwide . The remission rate type 2 diabetes one two year bariatric surgery approximately 70 % . Some study indicate remission rate type 2 diabetes high gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy . Other study indicate similar effect reduction HbA1c . Weight reduction comparable gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy although evidence suggets large weight loss follow gastric bypass surgery . Larger weight loss clearly contribute somewhat great improvement glucose homeostasis gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy . Still , one might speculate change gut hormone may contribute high remission rate type 2 diabetes gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy . Improved β-cell function observe gastric bypass surgery may link high postprandial level Glucagonlike peptide 1 see gastric bypass surgery . Beta cell function , knowledge , address one previous study sleeve gastrectomy , author report increase first-phase insulin secretion three day procedure . Although several study address change gastrointestinal hormone incretin effect insulin secretion gastric bypass estimate study . To best knowledge incretin effect insulin secretion sleeve gastrectomy remain unexplored.We aware four ongoing randomise control trial compare effect gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy several endpoint include weight comorbidities ( ClinicalTrial.gov identifier : NCT00722995 , NCT00356213 , NCT00793143 , NCT00667706 ) . However , study include subject with-out type 2 diabetes therefore power detect between-group difference HbA1c beta-cell function diabetic patient . In conclusion , effect gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy glycaemia fully elucidate . Moreover , impact alter beta-cell function post surgery need explore . We hypothesise great improvement beta-cell function gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy translates well glycaemic control subject type 2 diabetes one year surgery .</brief_summary>
