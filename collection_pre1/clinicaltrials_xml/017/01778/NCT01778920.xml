	<brief_summary>The goal study perform image patient 's tumor chest open tumor remove . According World Health Organization , lung cancer common cause cancer-related death men woman , responsible 1.3 million death worldwide annually 2004 . Surgery remain best option patient present operable Stage I II cancer , however five year survival rate candidate remain dismal 53 % Stage I 32 % Stage II . The high rate recurrence suggest surgeon unable completely detect remove primary tumor nodule satisfactory manner well linger metastasis sentinel lymph node . By ensure negative margin image surgery would possible u improve rate recurrence free patient thus overall survival . Thoracic malignancies ideal disease investigate intra-operative imaging . Over 85 % lung pleural malignancy express folate receptor alpha ( FRA ) . It important note FRA express proximal tubule kidney , activate macrophage , choroidal plexus . Thus , false positive detection rate expect extremely low . A group well know u Netherlands complete pilot study utilize folate-fluorescein isothiocyanate ( folate-FITC ) conjugate 12 patient ovarian cancer . Another group investigator Mayo subsequently perform study 20 patient without serious adverse event ( personal communication ) . They report excellent sensitivity specificity technique grade 1 side effect ( allergic reaction ) . All side effect reverse injection halt . Patients history allergic reaction insect bite participate ( fluorescein derive firefly insect , folate essential vitamin ) .</brief_summary>
