	<brief_summary>Background : - Cardiometabolic diseases medical disorder occur together affect heart . They increase risk develop heart disease diabetes . One disorder , psoriasis , inflammation mostly affect skin affect entire body . Another disorder , atherosclerosis , process cholesterol gradually deposit wall artery . This cause arteries harden become less flexible . Many cell cause psoriasis also cause atherosclerosis . Researchers want look relationship cardiometabolic diseases psoriasis . Objectives : - To study relationship psoriasis cardiometabolic disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age psoriasis . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants seven outpatient visit 4 year . The first visit screen visit . Visits 2 be12 month visit 1 . Visits 3 , 4 , 5 , schedule yearly next 3 year . If participant psoriasis flare severe symptom , may extra visit . Those leave study early final visit full series test . - At visit 1 , 2 , 5 , flare visit , participant physical exam medical history . They provide blood urine sample , well optional tissue biopsy . They also heart function test . Imaging study , well optional photograph affect area , perform . These test also perform final visit . - At visit 3 4 , participant physical exam medical history . They also provide blood urine sample , heart function test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over past two decade , inflammation identify important pathogenic process cardiometabolic disease ( CMD ) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , diabetes obesity . However , mechanistic link inflammation disease state human remain poorly understood . In study , propose utilize psoriasis , common , chronic inflammatory T-cell skin disease associate increase CVD CMD model understand effect chronic inflammation diseases state . We conduct prospective cohort study understand effect chronic inflammation vascular metabolic disease NIH Clinical Center . Furthermore , initiate large scale collection blood skin extramural site facilitate discovery pathway involve inflammatory modulation CVD CMD</detailed_description>

For image study , pregnant woman lactate woman , unless willing discard breast milk 24 hour receive FDG contrast Subjects contraindication MRI scan receive optional PET/MRI . These contraindication include subject follow device : Central nervous system aneurysm clip Implanted neural stimulator Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator Cochlear implant Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) Implanted Insulin pump Metal shrapnel bullet Subjects BMI &gt; 40 also receive PET MRI . Subjects severe renal excretory dysfunction , estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m^2 body surface area accord Modification Diet Renal Disease criterion , receive cardiac CT angiography , gadolinium contrast agent PET/MRI .</criteria>
