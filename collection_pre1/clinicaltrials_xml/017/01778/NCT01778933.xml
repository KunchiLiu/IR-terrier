	<brief_summary>According National Cancer Institute , estimate 64,770 men woman diagnose kidney cancer 2012 . Of number , estimate 13,570 die disease . Surgery remain one best option patient present operable Stage II III cancer , however five year survival rate candidate remain dismal 63.7 % Stage II 11 % Stage III . The high rate recurrence suggest surgeon unable completely detect remove primary tumor nodule satisfactory manner well linger metastasis sentinel lymph node . By ensure negative margin image surgery would possible investigator improve rate recurrence free patient thus overall survival . Renal cell malignancy ideal disease investigate intra-operative imaging . 70 % kidney malignancy express folate receptor alpha ( FRA ) . It important note FRA express proximal tubule kidney , activate macrophage , choroidal plexus . Thus , false positive detection rate expect extremely low . A group well know u Netherlands complete pilot study utilize folate-FITC conjugate 12 patient ovarian cancer . Another group investigator Mayo subsequently perform study 20 patient without serious adverse event ( personal communication ) . They report excellent sensitivity specificity technique grade 1 side effect ( allergic reaction ) . All side effect reverse injection halt . Patients history allergic reaction insect bite participate ( fluorescein derive firefly insect , folate essential vitamin ) .</brief_summary>
