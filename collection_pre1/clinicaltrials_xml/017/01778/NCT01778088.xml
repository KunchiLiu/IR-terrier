	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine recommend dose I-131-CLR1404 , radiolabeled therapy compound , treat subject glioma . Subjects meet study entry criterion receive I-131-CLR1404 . For subject , study conduct three phase , dosimetric , therapy , follow-up . In dosimetric phase , subject receive one 5 mCi dose study drug undergo whole body image day infusion post-infusion day 2 , 3 , 7 assessment biodistribution tumor uptake I-131-CLR1404 . If normal expect biodistribution demonstrate , subject begin therapy phase . In therapy phase , subject receive dose base body surface area may receive additional dos meet dose criterion . After last treatment dose , subject enter follow-up phase follow monthly . All subject prescribe thyroid protection medication take 24 hour prior injection dosimetric dose , continue 14 day administration therapy dose .</brief_summary>
