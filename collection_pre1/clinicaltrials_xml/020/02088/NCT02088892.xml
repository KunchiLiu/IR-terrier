	<brief_title>A Clinical Challenge Study BCG Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , assess vaccine efficacy tuberculosis ( TB ) alternative large randomize controlled trial . These efficacy trial novel TB vaccine difficult , long costly . For reason urgent need valid , reliable , strong correlate protection help distinguish candidate TB vaccine undergo phase I trial , thereby allow vaccine development field advance quickly , cost-effective manner . This study aim address current lack immunological correlate TB vaccine field . As alternative phase II field trial , human challenge model provide evaluation preliminary efficacy vaccine candidate . Challenge model , concept deliberate infectious challenge human volunteer , well establish pathogen malaria , typhoid dengue , model greatly facilitate vaccine development . At present safe human challenge model Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tb ) infection enable proof-of-concept efficacy evaluation candidate vaccine . Whilst scientist use M. tb challenge agent evaluate efficacy clinical trial safety ethical reason , use another mycobacterium , attenuate Mycobacterium bovis , surrogate M. tb infection . Attenuated Mycobacterium bovis mycobacterial strain BCG safe use human . An effective vaccine M. tb also effective BCG . After injection human , BCG replicate , effective TB vaccine reduce BCG replication . The BCG challenge model base premise . In human BCG challenge model , BCG administer intradermally degree BCG growth suppression quantify analyse tissue obtain punch biopsy volunteer ' skin BCG 'challenge ' site . This study aim use two different strain BCG , standard high dose , optimise BCG challenge model .</detailed_description>
