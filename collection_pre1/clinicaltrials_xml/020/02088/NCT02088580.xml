	<brief_title>Feasibility Tolerability Adjunct Chronotherapy Depressed Inpatients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute depression , suicidality continue significant cause morbidity mortality , frequently result acute inpatient hospitalization . Currently available treatment depression limitation acute care include , either slow onset action case pharmacotherapy , high cost limited availability case ECT . This exacerbate ever shorten hospitalization time . Subsequently many individual admit depression discharge week expect symptomatic relief . Further , many case treatment result trial multiple medication effective treatment regimen find ( treatment find ) ( Rush , Trivedi et al . 2006 ) . There subsequently great need effective anti-depressant therapy rapid onset action , widespread availability , cost effectiveness . There consistent expand body literature show chronotherapy effective , rapid treatment acute depression ( Wu , Kelsoe et al . 2009 , Martiny , Refsgaard et al . 2012 , Echizenya , Suda et al . 2013 ) . Published study report response remission rate range 41-61 % , 24-59 % respectively acutely . Chronotherapy brief protocol involve combination wake therapy ( total sleep deprivation ) , sleep phase advance ( shift earlier sleep schedule gradual normalization ) , bright light therapy . The currently publish report demonstrate efficacy unipolar bipolar depression , report stability result long 9 week ( long design study ) . Studies complete real world clinical population , include co-morbid population , group show worsen effect psychotic depression ( Benedetti , Zanardi et al . 1999 ) , panic disorder ( Roy-Byrne , Uhde et al . 1986 ) . The treatment well tolerate high percentage individual complete procedure . The current body literature encouraging , technique utilize clinically facility ( include institution ) , however still relatively clinical trial publish , still unanswered question limit widespread clinical utility . One issue relate high percentage publish trial perform outside US ( although do US ) . Because high percentage study do country clear procedure translate well treatment paradigm US . Currently US , inpatient admission restrict individual severe , often highly treatment resistant disease include acute suicidality . To writer knowledge study specifically address suicidality . It also clear patient US tolerate procedure . Tolerability address many publish paper , general procedure tolerate well side effect , however , unclear procedure would tolerate clinical patient US .</detailed_description>
